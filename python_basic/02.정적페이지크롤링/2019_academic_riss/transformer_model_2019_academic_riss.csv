FAGON: Fake News Detection Model Using Grammatical Transformation on Deep Neural Network,2019,"['Fake news detection', 'Grammatical transformation', 'Deep neural network']",,"As technology advances, the amount of fake news is increasing more and more by various reasons such as political issues and advertisement exaggeration. However, there have been very few research works on fake news detection, especially which uses grammatical transformation on deep neural network. In this paper, we shall present a new Fake News Detection Model, called FAGON(Fake news detection model using Grammatical transformation On deep Neural network) which determines efficiently if the proposition is true or not for the given article by learning grammatical transformation on neural network. Especially, our model focuses the Korean language. It consists of two modules: sentence generator and classification. The former generates multiple sentences which have the same meaning as the proposition, but with different grammar by training the grammatical transformation. The latter classifies the proposition as true or false by training with vectors generated from each sentence of the article and the multiple sentences obtained from the former model respectively. We shall show that our model is designed to detect fake news effectively by exploiting various grammatical transformation and proper classification structure."
Kinetic Model for the Phase Transformation of High‑Strength Steel Under Arbitrary Cooling Conditions,2019,['Kinetic model for phase transformation · HSS · Arbitrary cooling conditions · Microstructure · Hot stamping'],,"To meet the demands of energy conservation and security improvement, high-strength steel (HSS) is widely used to producesafety-related automotive components. In addition to fully high-strength parts, HSS is also used to manufacture componentswith tailored properties. In this work, a computational model is presented to predict the austenite decomposition into ferrite,pearlite, bainite and martensite during arbitrary cooling paths in HSS. First, a kinetic model for both diffusional and martensitetransformations under isothermal or non-isothermal with constant cooling rate cooling conditions is proposed basedon the well-known Johnson–Mehl–Avrami–Kolmogorov and Kamamoto models. The model is then modified for arbitrarycooling conditions through the introduction of the effects of the cooling rate, and the influence of diffusional transformationson martensite transformation is considered. Next, the detailed kinetics parameters are identified by fitting experimental datafrom BR1500HS steel. The model is further verified by several experiments conducted outside of the fit domain. The resultsobtained by calculation are found to be in good agreement with the corresponding experimental data, including the transformationhistories, volume fraction microconstituents and Vickers hardness. Additionally, the model is also implementedas a subroutine in ABAQUS to simulate a tailored-strength hot stamping process of HSS, and the results are consistent withthe test data. Thus, this computational model can be used as a guideline to design manufacturing processes that achieve thedesired microstructure and material properties."
Transforming the Fitness Center Business Model: A Service-Profit Chain Approach,2019,"['Business Model', 'Competitive Advantage', 'Employee Relations', 'Fitness', 'Service-Profit Chain']",,"With the surging need for indoor leisure activities for Koreans due to deteriorating air condition and weather, the competitions among various business segments in the fitness industry have also grown, facing a considerable challenge for survival. Many fitness centers suffer from bad quality of service, transient and poorly trained workforce, and damaging reputation; thus, deteriorating sustainability in the long run. While a few fitness center operators offer differentiated products and services, unique marketing programs, and deeply discounted pricing scheme in order to acquire new customers and retain existing customers, the business model of the fitness industry needs a thorough evaluation to test its validity and profitability. By using a case study, this research examines how one fitness chain company in Korea is differentiating itself and transforming the industry dynamics. Using interviews as primary research source, this paper incorporates the service-profit chain framework to examine the critical success factors of the fitness industry, identify differentiating service delivery factors, and explore further opportunities to establish as a sustainable business model. Finally, this study derives implications from employee and customer loyalty construct to reshape the future fitness industry."
Application of Variable Projection Method based on Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization in Spatial Cartesian Coordinate Transformation Model,2019,"['separable nonlinear least squares problem', 'variable projection', 'gram-schmidt orthogonalization', 'qr decomposition', 'spatial cartesian coordinate transformation']",,"For the linear and nonlinear parameters that can be separated in the spatial Cartesian coordinate transformation model, we use the variable projection algorithm in this paper to represent the linear parameters with nonlinear parameters, which are transformed into least squares problems with only nonlinear parameters. We simplify the matrix of the nonlinear function by the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization method, and combine the nonlinear least squares iterative method with the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm to solve for the coordinate transformation parameters. Experiments are carried out by solving for the coordinate transformation parameters of the independent spatial Cartesian coordinate system and the CGCS2000 coordinate system. We compare the solution results of the four methods (parameter non-separation method, traditional variable projection method, variable projection method based on QR decomposition, and variable projection method based on Gram-Schmidt orthogonal decomposition) with respect to the calculated results, the number of iterations and the computation time. The experimental results show that the proposed method in this paper requires a lower computation time and achieves higher computational efficiency when obtaining the same solution results and with the same number of iterations."
Pseudo MLE for semiparametric transformation model with doubly truncated data,2019,"['EM algorithm', 'Pseudo-likelihood', 'Double truncation', 'Inverse-probability-weighted']",,"In this article, we consider the efficient estimation of the semiparametric transformation model with doubly truncated data. We propose a two-step approach for obtaining the pseudo maximum likelihood estimators (PMLE) of regression parameters. In the first step, the truncation time distribution is estimated by the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (Shen, 2010a) when the distribution function K of the truncation time is unspecified or by the conditional maximum likelihood estimator (Bilker and Wang, 1996) when K is parameterized. In the second step, using the pseudo complete-data likelihood function with the estimated distribution of truncation time, we propose expectation– maximization algorithms for obtaining the PMLE.Weestablish the consistency of the PMLE.The simulation study indicates that the PMLE performs well in finite samples. The proposed method is illustrated using an AIDS data set."
Robust Image Watermarking via Perceptual Structural Regularity-based JND Model,2019,"['STDM', 'robust JND model', 'watermarking robustness', 'structural regularity', 'direction energy']",,"A better tradeoff between robustness and invisibility will be realized by using the just noticeable (JND) model into the quantization-based watermarking scheme. The JND model is usually used to describe the perception characteristics of human visual systems (HVS). According to the research of cognitive science, HVS can adaptively extract the structure features of an image. However, the existing JND models in the watermarking scheme do not consider the structure features. Therefore, a novel JND model is proposed , which includes three aspects: contrast sensitivity function, luminance adaptation, and contrast masking (CM). In this model, the CM effect is modeled by analyzing the direction features and texture complexity, which meets the human visual perception characteristics and matches well with the spread transform dither modulation (STDM) watermarking framework by employing a new method to measure edge intensity. Compared with the other existing JND models, the proposed JND model based on structural regularity is more efficient and applicable in the STDM watermarking scheme. In terms of the experimental results, the proposed scheme performs better than the other watermarking scheme based on the existing JND models."
BERT Transformer와 Deep Learning을 활용한 전이학습 효과 검증 연구 :법률상담데이터 분류문제 적용,2019,"['Transfer Learning', 'Natural Language Processing', 'BERT', 'Deep Learning', 'Classification', 'Neural Network']",,"As AI(artificial intelligence) is actively researched, it is being applied in various fields such as natural language processing, video and voice processing. However, voices pointing out the technical limitations of deep learning are spreading, and accordingly, researches for solving the technical limitations of deep learning are being actively conducted. In this paper, BERT, well known as the pre-training model of natural language processing, was applied to the classification problem of legal counseling data to verify the effect of transfer learning. Using BERT pre-trained data, the Transformer classification model was implemented and applied to the problem of legal counseling data classification, which showed higher accuracy than the traditional machine learning algorithm."
An Efficient Model Based on Smoothed ℓ<sub>0</sub> Norm for Sparse Signal Reconstruction,2019,"['Compressed sensing', 'smoothed ℓ<sub>0</sub> norm', 'generalized approximate function', 'reconstruction algorithm']",,"Compressed sensing (CS) is a new theory. With regard to the sparse signal, an exact reconstruction can be obtained with sufficient CS measurements. Nevertheless, in practical applications, the transform coefficients of many signals usually have weak sparsity and suffer from a variety of noise disturbances. What's worse, most existing classical algorithms are not able to effectively solve this issue. So we proposed an efficient algorithm based on smoothed ℓ<sub>0</sub> norm for sparse signal reconstruction. The direct ℓ<sub>0</sub> norm problem is NP hard, but it is unrealistic to directly solve the ℓ<sub>0</sub> norm problem for the reconstruction of the sparse signal. To select a suitable sequence of smoothed function and solve the ℓ<sub>0</sub> norm optimization problem effectively, we come up with a generalized approximate function model as the objective function to calculate the original signal. The proposed model preserves sharper edges, which is better than any other existing norm based algorithm. As a result, following this model, extensive simulations show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the similar algorithms used for solving the same problem."
CONSTITUTIVE MODELING OF ASYMMETRIC HARDENING BEHAVIOR OF TRANSFORMATION-INDUCED PLASTICITY STEELS,2019,"['Transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP)', 'Asymmetry', 'Combined isotropic–kinematic hardening rule', 'Springback', 'Phase transformation']",,"Transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) steels are part of advanced high strength steels capable of phase transformation, having good strength and ductility. The transformation rate is known to be dependent on the stress state, which may lead to asymmetric hardening behaviour for TRIP steels with compressive flow stresses larger than tensile ones. Sheet stamping products of TRIP steels show complex springback because of the asymmetry in addition to the large strength, which will complicate the analysis of sheet metal forming processes. In this work, the asymmetric hardening behaviour of a TRIP steel with a tensile strength of 1180 MPa was measured using the sheet tension–compression tester. An asymmetric hardening model was developed by introducing an off-centred bounding surface for the kinematic back-stress evolution, to depict the asymmetric hardening behaviour. The model parameters of the proposed constitutive equations were obtained from the stress– strain curves under tension followed by compression. The stress–strain curves were well captured by the developed constitutive model, whereas the conventional symmetric model fails to describe the asymmetric hardening behaviour of the TRIP steel. For validation, load-displacement curve and springback angles of three-point bending test were compared with the predictions by the proposed model."
Transformer 기반 번역문 사후 교정,2019,"['기계 번역', '번역문 사후 교정', 'transformer', '다중 인코더 구조', 'machine translation', 'automatic post-editing', 'multi-encoder architecture']","번역문 사후 교정은 기계 번역 시스템의 결과물을 교정하여 더 나은 번역문을 만들어내는 연구로, 기계 번역 시스템에 독립적으로 번역 품질 향상을 위해 제안된 분야이다. 본 논문에서는 최근의 연구 흐름에 따라 번역문 사후 교정을 번역문과 원문을 별도의 소스로 간주하는 다중 소스 번역 문제(multi-source translation problem)로 간주하고, 이를 바탕으로 Transformer를 이용한 다중 인코더 구조의 사후 교정 모델을 제안한다. 이 모델은 각 입력과 교정문 사이의 의존성을 별도로 학습하고, 이들을 더하여 최종 입출력 의존성을 얻는다. WMT17 사후 교정 말뭉치를 이용한 실험에서는 다중 인코더 모델이 기존 모델에 비해 더 나은 교정 성능을 보였으며, 사후 교정을 거치지 않은 문장에 비해서도 나은 번역품질을 보였다.","Automatic Post-Editing (APE) is a study on the correction for the output of machine translation (MT) systems for the purpose of improving their translation quality. In this paper, APE is regarded as a multi-source translation problem in which one source is an MT output and the other is an input source sentence. So we propose a neural multi-encoder post-editing model based on the transformer. This model aims to find out the dependencies of multiple sources against their post-edited sentence separately. It then adds them to achieve the final input-output dependency. Our experiment on the WMT17 APE data shows that the multi-encoder model outperforms the basic transformer model, producing a better MT output."
Probabilistic Modeling of Reaction Force/Torque through Data Transformation and Entropy Analysis,2019,"['Reaction force/torque recognition', 'Entropy analysis', 'Feature selection', 'Fast Fourier transform', 'Discrete wavelet transform', 'Moment transform', 'Hidden Markov model']",,"In this study, we propose a method for improving the recognition performance of a probabilistic model through entropy analysis after transforming the time-varying reaction force/torque (F/T) signals. To conduct a task, it is important for a robot to recognize the reaction forces/torques from physical interactions with objects or the environment. The reaction force/torque signals measured using an F/T sensor contain a large number of noise components owing to the sensitivity of the sensor. Therefore, the recognition performance depends on how the noise components included in the training and test datasets are dealt with. For this purpose, the reaction force/torque signals are transformed from time-domain signals to noise-reduced and/or noise-robust features through transformation techniques. Herein, we apply three different transformation techniques: fast Fourier transform, discrete wavelet transform, and moment transform. Next, taskrelevant features are selected from all these transformed features based on entropy analysis, after which the features are used to learn a hidden Markov model. To evaluate our proposed method, several robot manipulation tasks (approaching, transferring, and positioning) are conducted using an open dataset with the reaction force/torque signals."
LTS Semantics Model of Event-B Synchronization Control Flow Design Patterns,2019,"['Behavior Semantic', 'Design Pattern Instantiation', 'Event-B Design Patterns', 'Labeled Transition System']",,"The Event-B design pattern is an excellent way to quickly develop a formal model of the system. Researchers have proposed a number of Event-B design patterns, but they all lack formal behavior semantics. This makes the analysis, verification, and simulation of the behavior of the Event-B model very difficult, especially for the control-intensive systems. In this paper, we propose a novel method to transform the Event-B synchronous control flow design pattern into the labeled transition system (LTS) behavior model. Then we map the design pattern instantiation process of Event-B to the instantiation process of LTS model and get the LTS behavior semantic model of Event-B model of a multi-level complex control system. Finally, we verify the linear temporal logic behavior properties of the LTS model. The experimental results show that the analysis and simulation of system behavior become easier and the verification of the behavior properties of the system become convenient after the Event-B model is converted to the LTS model."

Real-time Inverse Model Estimation by a Recursive Least Squares Method for Disturbance Observer-based Control Systems: Balancing Control of a Single-wheel Robot,2019,"['DOB', 'inverse model estimation', 'recursive least square', 'single-wheel robot', 'stability']",,"This article proposes a real-time identification and control technique for disturbance observer (DOB) – based control systems to improve the balancing control performance of a single-wheel robot. In a DOB-based control configuration, the inverse model of the system is obtained by inverting the identified forward model to extract the disturbance. However, a problem arises when the stability of the inverse model is not guaranteed. The Q filter design may solve the problem, but the process is time consuming. Therefore, we propose a stable inverse model identification technique with a minimal effort of designing Q filters in DOB schemes. The proposed scheme follows three steps: a recursive least square (RLS) method is used for updating the parameters of a second order model. Then the stability is checked. The last step is to make the model stabilized depending upon the stability through the all-pass-filter technique. After these steps, the transformed inverse model becomes stable and finally can be used for DOB control schemes. Experimental studies on balancing control of a single-wheel robot are conducted and their performances are compared to verify the proposal."
The Reduction Method of a Stray Load Loss of Distribution Transformer on the Bushing Flange Plate with STS,2019,['Bushing · Stray load loss · Distribution transformer'],,"This paper deals with the stray load loss on the bushing fl ange plate of low voltage side for high effi ciency of the distribution transformer. To reduce the magnetic fl ux concentration, three models are proposed as follows. First, the basic transformer model is designed which is consisted of the windings, the core, the case and the bushing. Second transformer model is designed to creating a slit at the area where the magnetic fl ux on the bushing fl ange plate is concentrated and then attaching the STS (Stainless steel). In the third model, the bushing fl ange plate around the bushing terminal is cut into a large square shape and STS is attached. As a result of the simulations, when the material of the case is only steel, the stray load loss is 10.56 W, while the case with STS slit is 1.49 W and the case with STS plate is 0.17 W. The stray load loss reduction rate was 85.9% and 98.4% compared with the steel plate model. It is also verifi ed by the load test using the distribution transformer based on simulation data."
Digital Transformation: Development of New Business Models in the Tourism Industry,2019,"['Information technology', 'Digital transformation', 'Business model', 'Customer value proposition', 'Operating model.']",,"People and businesses are equally accepting the digital revolution.

A rheological model to predict viscosity of dispersions as a function of the modified Peclet number,2019,"['suspensions', 'emulsions', 'hard spheres', 'rheological model', 'viscosity']",,"The suspensions and emulsions are important products and raw materials for various industrial production and processing branches. The knowledge concerning the rheological properties of such substances is of key importance for many manufacturing processes. Many dependences can be found within the literature but there is lack of model that takes into account the influence of inner phase concentration, share rate, and diameters of the dispersed phase particles on a viscosity of these systems. The presented work goal was to obtain a rheological equation containing the modified form of Peclet number, which would provide the relation between the viscosity, the volume fraction, and the shear rate. The theory of Kozeny-Carman, which transforms the granular structure into a bunch of the torturous capillary tubes, was the base of this model. The proposed model has been verified for data available in the literature and for the data obtained in authors own experiments."

In this paper, the electrical aging test of fiber sheath material based on a gradual voltage-rising method was performed and the influence of thermal aging on electrical aging was determined. Compared to the oil-paper insulation performance of traditional transformers, it was found that ethylene tetrafluoroethylene(ETFE), polytetrafluoroethylene(PTFE) and Polyamide 12 (PA 12) were better than oil-paper. Statistical analysis of the ETFE material and oil-paper test data was conducted using double-parameter Weibull distribution. The inverse power and exponential functions were used to fit the experimental data and voltage tolerance coefficients of the ETFE material were obtained. Experimental results show the parameters of the ETFE model in the inverse power function and exponential function model are better than those of the oil paper insulation, and the sheathed fiber is ETFE that can be stably operated in the transformer."

To overcome the limitation of using BMP-2, we used an umbilical cord serum (UCS) thatexhibits various growth factors (epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-β, nerve growthfactor, etc.). To evaluate the effect of the UCS, we studied the synergistic effect of the composite scaffoldusing BMP-2/UCS/alginate coated on three-dimensional mesh-structured poly-e-caprolactone (PCL),both in vitro and in vivo, using a rat mastoid obliteration model. The newly suggested biocompositescaffold (BMP-2/UCS/alginate) demonstrates significantly rapid new bone formation (particularly, in theinterstitial area of the scaffold) compared to those of two controls: PCL mesh structure coated withalginate, and BMP-2/alginate-coated PCL scaffold.

A Non-Linear Permanent Magnet Working Point Migration Model and its Application to Simulation of a Polarized Magnetic System,2019,"['nonlinear permanent magnet', 'operation point', 'hysteresis model', 'magnetic equivalent circuit', 'bistable polarized magnetic system']",,"The paper addresses the issue of the working point migration in non-linear permanent magnets (PM). Starting from the considerations of energy, a novel working-point migration (WPM) model is proposed which can be incorporated into a magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC). The basic theory of working-point migration is discussed which focus on the second quadrant of the magnetic hysteresis loop. The calculation method of the WPM model is proposed based on the relationship between the recoil line model and the affine transformation hysteresis loop. The establishment method for the resultant working point is described by combining the demagnetization curve and the recoil line models in the minor hysteresis loop. The static characteristic of a bistable polarized magnetic system (BPMS), as used in actuators, is calculated using the magnetic circuit method based on the WPM, while a finite element model (FEM) is also derived. The calculation method for the WPM used in MEC is also discussed. The WPM based MEC model yields reasonable results, compared with FEM, of the latching force but with much faster calculation speeds. Furthermore, the working-point state of the PM is clearly illustrated. The test system of the BPMS prototype is established. The test data and WPM model calculation results are compared. It is shown that the WPM model provides accurate prediction of static characteristics of an electromagnetic system."
Analysis of Effect of Winding Interleaving on Leakage Inductance and Winding Loss of High Frequency Transformers,2019,['High frequency transformer · Interleaving winding · Leakage inductance · Winding loss · Frequency dependency'],,"This work concerns prediction of the eff ect of winding interleaving used in high frequency transformers on leakage inductance and AC resistance. Although the reduction of the leakage inductance and AC resistance by applying interleaving has been well known by most designers, it is diffi cult to foresee the electrical performance of the transformer in the design stage. Based on the one-dimensional model for windings of magnetic components, this study presents a frequency dependent analytical method for leakage inductance and winding loss, which is suitable for no interleaving and interleaving winding confi gurations.Several high frequency transformer models with distinct winding arrangements are built, and the validity of the proposed method is verifi ed by comparing the FEM simulation and measurement. Other analytical methods are also compared with this new method. Results show that this method is more reliable and accurate as compared to the other analytical methods.The interleaving provides signifi cant advantage in reducing the leakage inductance and winding loss."

Finally, the analysis and design conclusions are verified by experimental results obtained from a 60W laboratory prototype of a multiple-output two-transistor flyback converter."
Energy Evolution of Rock under Different Stress Paths and Establishment of a Statistical Damage Model,2019,"['stress path', 'stress-strain', 'energy evolution', 'microelement strength', 'damage', 'distribution parameters']",,"In consideration of the influence of energy dissipation on the rock compression process, the traditional elastic stress-strain relationship was improved by adding the energy release rate. The microintensity of the rock was assumed to satisfy the Weibull distribution. The improved stress-strain relationship was transformed into a triaxial stress-strain model in consideration of the loading damage combined with mesodamage mechanics. The characteristic points of the stress-strain curve and the experimental data were utilized to calculate the distribution parameters of the rock under different conditions. The model curve was compared with the experimental data. Results showed that the stress-strain curve of the rock has peak points in the conventional triaxial compression test, but the radial peak of the rock was not evident in the unloading test. The energy of the rock under the loading path was smaller than that under the unloading path. The model curve exhibited a high degree of fitting with the experimental data, and its correlation coefficient was relatively large (> 0.90), which indicated that the model can clearly represent the actual damage and evolution law of the surrounding rock. Furthermore, the established model can also reflect the rock’s stress-strain relationship, which can serve as a practical guide for relevant applications. Finally, the distribution parameters also reflected the evolution law of rock energy and provided a method for the assessment of rock energy and damage trend."

Effect of Relaxin Expression from an Alginate Gel-Encapsulated Adenovirus on Scar Remodeling in a Pig Model,2019,"['Gene therapy', 'scar remodeling', 'relaxin', 'adenovirus', 'alginate gel', 'pig scar model']",,"Purpose: Relaxin (RLX) is a transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) antagonist that is believed to function as a potent collagenre-arranger and a major suppressor of extracellular matrix components. Adenoviruses (Ads) are accepted vectors for cancer genetherapy. However, repeated treatments of Ad are limited by short-term biological activity in vivo. The efficacy of sustained RLX expressionto scar remodeling was assessed using an injectable alginate gel-matrix system.Materials and Methods: Pig scar tissue was treated with relaxin-expressing Ad loaded in alginate gel (gel/Ad-RLX). Surface areas,color, and pliability of scars were compared, and various factors influencing scar formation and collagen arrangement were analyzed.Results: Gel/Ad-RLX decreased scar size, color index, and pliability. Immunohistochemistry showed decreased levels of majorextracellular matrix proteins in the gel/Ad-RLX-treated group. Furthermore, treatment with gel/Ad-RLX reduced expression of tissueinhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 and alpha-smooth muscle actin and markedly increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 in pig scar tissues. Gel/Ad-RLX also significantly downregulated TGF-β1 and upregulated TGF-β3 mRNAs in pig scar tissues.Conclusion: These results support a prominent role for RLX in scar remodeling and suggest that gel/Ad-RLX may have therapeuticeffects on scar formation."
Combustion Instability Analysis of a Model Gas Turbine by Application of Dynamic Mode Decomposition,2019,"['Gas turbine', 'Combustion instability', 'Dynamic mode decomposition', 'Transfer function']",,"Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) technique is applied to analyze combustion instabilities in a model gas turbine combustor. The flame transfer function (FTF) obtained by the DMD method agrees with the experimental results qualitatively. However, FTF results show that the perturbation frequency with the largest gain is 100Hz, which contradicts the 1000Hz with the largest amplitude in the fast Fourier transform (FFT) results. In order to figure out this, gains and damping coefficients of all resonance frequencies are calculated by DMD technique. Results show the possibility that the model combustor has high-frequency instabilities as a results of coupling between flame and chamber responses. Another finding is that to obtain a pure FTF, the combustor must be removed to exclude coupling of chamber response with flame response."

TPTD or vehicle was administered subcutaneously 3 times a week for 8 weeks.Blood glucose, serum sclerostin, total tibial BMD, femoral shaft bone strength, and bone quality using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy imaging were evaluated.Results: No significant differences in serum sclerostin levels were evident among these groups after 8 weeks of treatment. TPTD significantly increased BMD in control mice (þ12.7%, P ¼ 0.02) and Akita mice (þ29.2%, P ¼ 0.001) compared with vehicle. Maximum load and stiffness were significantly higher in Akita mice treated with TPTD than in Akita mice treated with vehicle (þ56.6%, P ¼ 0.03 and þ 90.5%, P ¼ 0.02, respectively). On Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy imaging, the mineral/matrix ratio was significantly lower in Akita mice treated with vehicle than in control mice (12.2%, P ¼ 0.02), and TPTD treatment significantly increased the mineral/matrix ratio (P ¼ 0.003).Conclusions: TPTD thus improved BMD and bone strength in both control mice and Akita mice, with improvements in the mineral/matrix ratio among Akita mice."
Bifidobacterium infantis Induces Protective Colonic PD-L1 and Foxp3 Regulatory T Cells in an Acute Murine Experimental Model of Inflammatory Bowel Disease,2019,"['Bifidobacterium infantis', 'Inflammatory bowel disease', 'Programmed cell death ligand 1', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'regulatory']",,"Background/Aims: The current study aims to investigate the protective effects of Bifidobacterium infantis on the abnormal immune response to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. Methods: Eight-week-old BALB/c mice were separated into five groups at random (control, DSS, DSS+B9 [B. infantis 1×109 CFU], DSS+B8 [B. infantis 1×108 CFU], and DSS+B7 [B. infantis 1×107 CFU]). Colitis was induced by 5% DSS ad libitum for 7 days, at which time we assessed weight, the disease activity index (DAI) score, and the histological damage score. The nuclear transcription factor Foxp3 (a marker of Treg cells), cytokines interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), and related proteins (programmed cell death ligand 1 [PD-L1] and programmed cell death 1 [PD-1]) were detected by an immunohistochemical method and Western blot. Results: B. infantis increased weight, decreased DAI scores and histological damage scores, increased the protein expression of Foxp3 (p<0.05) and cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β1 in mouse colon tissue (p<0.05), and increased the expression of PD-L1 in the treatment groups relative to that in the DSS group (p<0.05). The effect of B. infantis on Foxp3 and PD-L1 was dose dependent in the treatment groups (p<0.05). PD-L1 was positively correlated with Foxp3, IL- 10, and TGF-β1. Conclusions: In a mouse model of IBD, B.infantis can alleviate intestinal epithelial injury and maintain intestinal immune tolerance and thus may have potential therapeutic value for the treatment of immune damage in IBD."

At the same time, it presents an interpretation of how structural changes in the global capitalist system have affected the creation, crisis, and change in Korean development model. To be specific, the author suggests that at the center of such transformation lies a shift from ‘development project’ to ‘globalization project’. In this context, the historical capitalist process experienced by Korean society is identified with that of Western societies. As ‘the social psychology of European colonialism’ was disseminated throughout the globe, Korean society entered into the early stage of modernization. During the ‘Golden Age’ of western capitalism, an anomalous, evanescent historical period uprisen with the internationalization of capitalism, South Korea moved from agricultural society to modern industrial society spurred by state-led industrialization plan. South Korea secured rapid economic growth by forcing its economic drive towards heavy and chemical industry in the early 1970s, when western capitalism slipped into a downturn, a result of its strategic adjustment to global industrial restructuring at the time. It is noteworthy that the rise and fall of the Bretton Woods system and the functioning of Bretton Woods institutions were also paralleled with different operational strategies devised by the development project and globalization project. In addition, the transformation in political economical institutions at the global level after World War II was closely associated with a shift in US foreign strategy. South Korea’s success in export-oriented industrialization was apparently indebted to the switchover in US Asia strategy after 1965, triggered by the conflict between the US and India and South Korea’s close cooperation as to the Vietnam War. All in all, understood ultimately as economic growth, is a political goal rather than a natural process."

Chronic inflammation leads to irreversible fibrosis in the skin and there is no treatment to completely abolish the inflammation and fibrosis. To prevent or treat the chronic process of AD, it is necessary to develop a murine model of AD that reflects the chronic process to identify the mechanism. The aims of this study were to develop a chronic AD model with a crude extract Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) antigen.Methods: We applied Af extract (40 μg) epicutaneously to the dorsal skin of BALB/c mice for 5 consecutive days per week during a period of 5 weeks for a chronic AD model, and 5 consecutive days repeatedly with 2 weeks interval for an acute AD model.Results: The clinical score and transepidermal water loss were more increased in the chronic AD model than in the acute AD model. Histologic findings showed that more increased epidermal thickness, neutrophil infiltration and hyperkeratosis in the chronic model than in the acute model. Skin fibrosis was more prominent in the chronic model than in the acute model. The mRNA expression levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, thymic stromal lymphopoietin, and interleukin-33 were increased in the skin of the chronic model compared to the acute model. The levels of total IgE, Af-specific IgE, IgG1, and IgG2a were significantly increased in the chronic model compared to controls.Conclusion: The Af-induced chronic AD model showed prominent fibrosis and increased TGF-β expression in the skin, which suggests that these models may be useful in the research for the mechanism of the chronic process in AD."

The first is to forecast solar irradiation and the second is to transform forecasted solar irradiation into power generation. There are two methods for transformation. One is to simulate with physical model, and another is to use regression model. In this study, we found the best-fit regression model by analyzing hourly data of PV output and solar irradiation data during three years for 242 PV plants in Korea. The best model was not a linear model, but a sigmoidal model and specifically a Gompertz model. The combined linear regression and Gompertz curve was proposed because a the curve has non-zero y-intercept. As the result, R2 and RMSE between observed data and the curve was significantly reduced."

However, Augmented reality virtual models are insufficient to describe reality of real model and there is a sense of heterogeneity, which reduces the objective commitment of work model and the reality of work environment. Although many methods to give a sense of reality to texture have been studied in the past, they have been confirmed that the method using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is more efficient than other methods. GAN is a field of learning non-intelligence that can learn the image relation between two domains and transform it into a desired form.

SSWB stands for ‘self－awareness’, ‘situational awareness’, ‘why awareness’, and ‘behavior change awareness’. This process can be expressed in 2X2 matrix such as reality(past to present) vs. ideal state(present to future), subjective(personal) vs. objective(environmental). In this study, the first quadrant refers to ‘self－awareness’, where ignorance and knowledge are made of a dyad. The second one is ‘situational awareness’, where the individual and the external environment constitute a set. The third one indicates ‘why awareness’, a combined set of the real state of present with the ideal goal to be attained in the future. Finally, the fourth quadrant represents ‘behavior change awareness’ which incorporates the practice toward value, needed to pursue in accordance with recognition of behavioral changes. Consequently, the wisdom learning process moves along with a cycle that enables individuals to create and build up new knowledge and experience. We suggest the criteria of this the whole process are ethical reflection of individuals and organizations.[Implications]First, this research was the first attempt in domestic business administration to study wise managers. Second, attempting a study to develop a model of how managerial wisdom can be learned has transformed abstract wisdom into a specific learning concept by embodied and visualizing the mechanisms for the resources of wisdom that anyone has. Third, based on this research, the foundation for the development of learning programs in each quadrant was established"

The self-similarity of the function may be the solution to the fractional differential equation of the nonlocal Hamiltonian equation. We take the Riemann- Liouville fractional derivative of the fractional integral kernel. The kernel can be interpreted as the probability for the plausibility of the investor’s intention. Also, the kernel can be rewritten according to the linear gas model of stable sizable particles. The size and the number of particles can be interpreted as the intentional size and the number of investors. The investor’s intention and the number are related to the detuning variable and the power of the function, respectively.

In this conversion process, the attribute values of the data are filled with binary or probability values in one-hot encoding. Next, this conversion data is input to the deep learning model, where the number of entries is not constant depending on the cardinality of each attribute. Then, the entry values of each attribute are assigned to the respective input nodes, and learning proceeds. This is different from existing learning models, and has an unusual structure in which arbitrary attribute values are distributedly input to multiple nodes in the input layer.

And as a methodology, we will analyze the cases of overseas field exploration through collaboration to provide clues as a practical suggestion and continuous project. The study covered start-ups of 4-5 participating companies in Gyeonggi Province, which participated in programs such as Manchester, Canada, Vancouver, and New York. Preparing a step-by-step support strategy for the field survey is the following three steps. Stage 1 is based on AR/VR's global base support, and is a way to set up global businesses by providing advance support for field exploration. The second stage is to provide customized support for field exploration by spreading global infrastructure for AR/VRs, and to nurture them by startup stage. Step 3 is to nurture AR/VR global brands by stabilizing AR/VR globally, and to select and focus operations. In conclusion, the significance and practical implications of the platform model are the establishment of the vision and mission of the field survey, the preparation of a step-by-step support strategy for the field survey, and the preparation of a system for sharing the role of the support system practitioners. It should be transformed from measuring short-term performance to maximizing long-term performance by fostering global collaboration experts with future tasks and direction, requesting a platform support system, which is a system for continuous support in stages, promoting not only South Korean but also foreign businesses."

SNS influencers act as early adopters in the process of new products being accepted. Chinese consumers are most affected by Hallyu, which increases interest in K-beauty products. This study analyzes how K-beauty SNS influencers are related to Chinese consumers. A survey was conducted among Chinese millennial consumers after watching videos provided by K-beauty SNS influencer; subsequently, 456 responses were used for data analysis. As a result, the analysis based on the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) distinguishes the central route and the peripheral route in the process of Chinese consumers accepting new SNS products. The study findings suggested that information quality, credibility, accuracy, and usefulness had significant effects on acceptance intention for new products among central route factors, and similarity, trustworthiness, pleasure, expertise, and attractiveness also had significant effects on the acceptance intention of new product among peripheral route factors. It was found that variables of the central route, rather than those of peripheral route, had stronger effects on the acceptance intention for new products. Consequently, the central route of K-beauty SNS influencer is more important to Chinese consumers' acceptance of new products. It is expected that this study will offer beauty influencer marketing-based cosmetics brands efficient consumer management suggestions."

We investigated the effect of RA and the role of these signaling molecules on the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 (p-Smad2/3) induced by TGF-${\beta}1$. Methods: A549 epithelial cells and CCD-11Lu fibroblasts were incubated and stimulated with or without all-trans RA (ATRA) and TGF-${\beta}1$ and with MAPK or MEK inhibitors. The levels of p-Smad2/3 were analyzed by western blotting. For animal models, we studied three experimental mouse groups: control, bleomycin, and bleomycin+ATRA group. Changes in histopathology, lung injury score, and levels of TGF-${\beta}1$ and Smad3 were evaluated at 1 and 3 weeks. Results: When A549 cells were pre-stimulated with TGF-${\beta}1$ prior to RA treatment, RA completely inhibited the p-Smad2/3. However, when A549 cells were pre-treated with RA prior to TGF-${\beta}1$ stimulation, RA did not completely suppress the p-Smad2/3. When A549 cells were pre-treated with MAPK inhibitor, TGF-${\beta}1$ failed to phosphorylate Smad2/3. In fibroblasts, p38 MAPK inhibitor suppressed TGF-${\beta}1$-induced p-Smad2.

More than ever, multicultural education is becoming important not only in general education but also in Christian education. However, the multicultural education that has been discussed so far in Korea has shown an attitude of accepting the Western multicultural education uncritically. Especially, the “multiculturalism” model among the types classified by Castle & Miller is at the center. Therefore, this paper focuses on the discourse of multicultural education, and then presents a “Korean multiculturalism model” on the basis of the discourse. More specifically, this paper explored the following three research themes. First, this paper critically examined the current discourse on multicultural education in relation to Christian education. The current multicultural education theories have been pointed out to be largely governed by the contribution approach and the additive approach. In addition, it is necessary to study the transformation approach and social action approach, especially the type of reconceptualists approach emphasizing religious dialogue and religious peace. Second, this paper critically examined the limits of multiculturalism and its alternatives. In particular, the US Trump Administration`s nationality preference policy called by “America First” has had a great impact on multicultural education around the world, suggesting the need for the Korean multiculturalism. Third, this study presented a “pungryudo(風流道) model” as a concrete model of religious peace model as a model of Korean multiculturalism.

On one hand, the global model did not consider the hypothesis that a relationship between predictors and the outcome variable might vary across the country (spatially homogeneous), while on the other hand, the local model considered that there was spatial heterogeneity within the country. The HPAI outbreak status in each province was used as a dependent variable and the number of poultry farm vehicle movements within each province (within variable), the number of poultry farm vehicle movement from one province to another province (outbound variable), the number of poultry farm vehicle movements from other provinces to one province (inbound variable), and the number of poultry farms in each province were included in the model as independent variables. The results of a global model were as follows: estimated coefficient of the log-transformed within variable was 0.73, that of the log-transformed outbound variable was 2.04, that of the log-transformed inbound variable was 0.74, and that of the number of poultry farms was 1.08. Only the number of poultry farms was a statistically significant variable (p-value < 0.001). The AIC score of the global model was 1397.5. The results of the local model were as follows: estimated median coefficient of the log-transformed within variable was 0.75, that of the log-transformed outbound variable was 2.54, that of the log-transformed inbound variable was 0.60, and that of the number of poultry farms was 0.07. The local model’s AIC score was 1382.2. The results of our study indicate that a local model would provide a better understanding of the relationship between HPAI outbreak status and poultry farm vehicle movements than that provided by a global model."

Micro-grinding temperature prediction considering the effects of crystallographic orientation and the strain induced by phase transformation,2019,['Micro-grinding Taylor factor Flow stress Crystallographic orientation Temperature Phase transformation'],,"This paper proposes a physical-based model to predict the temperature in the micro-grinding of maraging steel 3J33b with the consideration of material microstructure and process parameters. In micro-grinding, the effects of crystallography on the grinding machinability become significant, since the depth of cut is of the same order as the grain size. In this research, the Taylor factor model for multi-phase materials is proposed to quantify the crystallographic orientation (CO) with respect to the cutting direction by examining the number and type of activated slip systems. Then, the flow stress model is developed, in which both the athermal stress resulted from the COs and the strain induced by the phase transformation are taken into account. On the basis of the flow stress model, the grinding forces are predicted followed by the calculation of the grinding heat. In the investigation, the triangular heat flux distribution and the reported energy partition model are applied in the calculation of workpiece temperature. Furthermore, the temperature model is validated by conducting an orthogonal-designed experiment, with the predictions of the maximum temperature in good agreement with the experimental data. Moreover, the predictive data is compared with the predictions resulted from the two other previously reported models. The results indicate that the proposed temperature model with considering the effect of CO and the phase transformation improved the prediction accuracy of the micro-grinding temperature."
Modeling and Analytical Calculation of a Multiphase Induction Motor in the Phase Loss Asymmetrical Transient Process,2019,['Transient model · Analytical calculation · Induction motor · Phase loss'],,"The multiphase independent winding induction motor (MIWIM) has wide application in AC drive systems of high control redundancy necessary to ships and coal mines. An accurate analysis of its phase loss transient process is a prerequisite for the phase loss fault-tolerant control. When a phase loss occurs, the internal magnetic fi elds of the MIWIM are asymmetric.In this case, conventional coordinate transformation or resultant space vector cannot be used to reduce the mathematical model of the motor phase loss to a lower order. Using a fi ve-phase induction motor as an object of study, this paper presents a full-order mathematical model suitable for the asymmetric state in the α – β –z1–z2–z3 coordinate system. The factor analysis of the frequency domain and no consideration of its small value make it possible to reduce the order of the analytical model.According to the constraint relationship between voltage and current, an analytical analysis is made of the motor dynamic characteristics after a phase loss. The results are in agreement with those of numerical simulation and experiment, which verify that the phase loss asymmetric transient model and analytic method of the MIWIM are feasible and eff ective."

Modeling pressure calculations in a stress-sensitive reservoir with a multistage fractured horizontal well,2019,"['Tight oil reservoir', 'multistage fractured horizontal well', 'stress sensibivity', 'pressure distribution', 'boundary element method']",,"Fractured horizontal wells have been widely used in tight reservoirs. The distribution of the formation pressure is related to the fracturing design, well pattern optimization and development effect. In addition, there is generally a stress sensitivity effect in tight reservoirs, which makes the pressure distribution more complex. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the formation pressure distribution in the development process of tight reservoirs by fractured horizontal wells. In this paper, using the Pedrosa transform, perturbation transform, Green formula and boundary element method, a pressure calculation model is first built and solved for a stress-sensitive reservoir with a multistage fractured horizontal well. Second, comparing the bottom hole pressure of this method with those of existing tight reservoir models illustrates the accuracy of this model. Finally, pressure contours with different permeability moduli and boundaries are obtained by solving the seepage model. The results indicate that this model can conveniently calculate the pressure at any position in stress-sensitive reservoirs with arbitrary boundaries. The pressure contours show that the stress-sensitive effect occurs mainly near the wellbore and affects the pressure distribution of this region. The results have a certain significance for fracturing design and well pattern optimization, which is beneficial for improving the development efficiency of tight oil reservoirs."
Modeling the Relationship between Process Parameters and Bulk Density of Barium Titanates,2019,"['Barium titanates', 'Bulk density', 'Artificial neural networks', 'Sensitivity analysis']",,"The properties of powder metallurgy products are related to their densities. In the present work, we demonstrate a method to apply artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained on experimental data to predict the bulk density of barium titanates. The density is modeled as a function of pressure, press rate, heating rate, sintering temperature, and soaking time using the ANN method. The model predictions with the training and testing data result in a high coefficient of correlation (R2 = 0.95 and Pearson's r = 0.97) and low average error. Moreover, a graphical user interface for the model is developed on the basis of the transformed weights of the optimally trained model. It facilitates the prediction of an infinite combination of process parameters with reasonable accuracy. Sensitivity analysis performed on the ANN model aids the identification of the impact of process parameters on the density of barium titanates."
은닉 마코프 모델을 이용한 심전도 QRS 검출 최적화에 관한 연구,2019,"['Hidden Markov Model', 'Gaussian Mixture Model', 'Continuous Wavelet Transform']",,"The heart is the body""s circulatory organ that supplies blood to the body. An electrocardiogram is the best means of measuring and diagnosing abnormal conduction of the heart muscle. Therefore, to diagnose patients suspected of heart disease, a Holter monitoring system measuring electrocardiography for 24 hours is used by doctors to examine and diagnose patients. However, diagnosing innumerable Holter data entails considerable effort by doctors directly. If QRS can be detected by an automated diagnostic system, many Holter data could be classified without diagnosing it by clinicians directly. In this paper, we tried to detect the QRS of electrocardiogram using the Hidden Markov Model. For objective verification, the onsets and offsets of QRS, which classified by the specialist, in the QT-database, were used as the reference labels. The Mexican Hat mother function was used for the wavelet transform. To study how to optimize the learning of hidden Markov models, the experiment was conducted by changing the batch size of the training data sets and the scale of the wavelet mother function. During the verification process, the mean and standard deviation of the difference between QRS onset and offset obtained from the test data sets through the hidden Markov model and the reference label classified by a specialist were used. As a result, the batch size was found to have the best performance using all 84 training data sets, and the scale of the mother function was found to have the best performance using scale j = 2, 3, 4. When the mean and standard deviation of QRS complexes detected from the hidden Markov model was -8.2822ms, ±5.821476ms(p=0.99818) onsets, respectively and -2.9588ms, ±6.5662ms(p=0.99838) offsets, respectively with 84 batch sizes and all three scale mother functions were trained, the results of onset, offset standard deviation were improved average about 22.1%, 30.9% respectively when compared with other algorithms using QT-Database"
A robust method for response variable transformations using dynamic plots,2019,"['diagnostics', 'dynamic plots', 'outliers', 'partial linear models', 'variable transformations']",,"The variable transformations are useful ways to guarantee the functional relationships in the model. However, the presence of outliers may undermine the accuracy of transformation. This paper deals with response transformations in the partial linear models under the existence of outliers. A new procedure for response transformation and outliers detection is proposed. The procedure uses a sequential method for identifying outliers and dynamic graphical methods for an appropriate transformation. The graphical tools make it possible to catch diagnostic information by monitoring the movement of points in the data. The procedure is illustrated with several examples. Examples show that visual clues regarding the optimal transformation, the fittness of the model and the outlyness of the observations can be checked from the series of plots."
A geometric error modeling method and trajectory optimization applied in laser welding system,2019,['Six-axis motion platform Error modeling Trajectory optimization Alignment algorithm Laser welding system'],,"In this paper, a geometric error modeling method is carried out on six-axis motion platform (SMP) in laser welding system (LWS), and an optimized algorithm is proposed for the alignment in LWS based on the error model. First, the topological structure of the given SMP is analyzed, and related homogeneous transformation matrices which are used for standing the orientation of SMP are established. By these matrices, the geometric error model is developed mathematically. Then, the error model is used for predicting the alignment deviations. A corresponding series of experiments for calculating the optical power loss in alignment are employed, and the comparison between simulation and experiments results indicate the validation of the error model. Furthermore, an optimized algorithm is applied to search the optimum aligning trajectory. Compared to conventional method, this algorithm has a broader range in searching extreme value, which can reduce the computational volume and improve the efficiency. It is also beneficial for improving the success rate of escaping from the local minimum spot and finding the optimum alignment spot. The error model is helpful to analyze the error propagation process and improve the alignment efficiency in LWS, which can be applied to other similar multi-axis precise system."

Modelling multiply connected heterogeneous objects using mixed-dimensional material reference features,2019,['Modelling'],,"This paper proposes a general method for ab-initio modelling and representation of heterogeneous objects that are associated with complex material variation over complex geometry. Heterogeneous objects like composites and naturally occurring objects (bones, rocks and meteorites) possess multiple and often conﬂicting properties (like high hardness and toughness simultaneously), which are associated with random and irregular material distribution. Modelling such objects is desired for numerical analysis and additive manufacturing to develop bio-implants, high-performance tools etc. However, it is difﬁcult to deﬁne and map the arbitrary material distribution within the object as the material distribution can be independent of the shape parameters or form features used to construct its solid model. This paper represents the source of random and irregular material distribution by mixed-dimensional entities with a focus on modelling compositional heterogeneity. The domain of effect of each material ref-erence entity is deﬁned automatically by using Medial Axis Transform (MAT), where the material distri-bution can be intuitively prescribed, starting from the material reference entity and terminating at the medial axis segment bounding the corresponding domain. Within such a domain, the spatial variation of the material is captured by a distance ﬁeld from the material reference entity, which can be controlled locally and independently. These domains are stored using the neighbourhood relation for efﬁcient oper-ations like altering material distribution across the material reference entity and material evaluation for a given geometric location. Results from an implementation for 2.5D objects are shown and the extension to 3D objects is discussed."
Conditional variance estimation via nonparametric generalized additive models,2019,"['Multiplicative conditional variance', 'Generalized additive models', 'Quasi-likelihood', 'Curse of dimension']",,"Generalized additive models provide a way of circumventing curse of dimension in a wide range of nonparametric regression problem. In this paper, we present a multiplicative model for conditional variance functions where one can apply a generalized additive regression method. This approach extends Fan and Yao (1998) to multivariate cases with a multiplicative structure. In this approach, we use squared residuals instead of using logtransformed squared residuals. This idea gives a smaller variance than Yu (2017) when the variance of squared error is smaller than the variance of log-transformed squared error.We provide estimators based on quasi-likelihood and an iterative algorithm based on smooth backfitting for generalized additive models. We also provide some asymptotic properties of estimators and the convergence of proposed algorithm. A numerical study shows the empirical evidence of the theory."
Non-recursive Discrete Fourier Transform-Based Frequency Estimation of the Power System,2019,['Frequency estimation · Revised 3-level discrete fourier transform · Second derivative · Tracking delay cancelation'],,"This paper suggests a frequency estimation method which consists of a combination of a revised 3-Level discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and a second derivative of each orthogonal component. The revised 3-Level DFT aims to counteract the harmful eff ect of harmonics and noises on frequency estimation accuracy by applying DFT to the input signal three times consecutively. Also, a cancelation technique of a tracking delay which is directly related to the data window length is proposed by adjusting the angle of voltage phasor. To evaluate the performance of proposed method, three diff erent kinds of computer-generated-signals which are according to IEEE C37.118.1a 2014 PMU Standard requirements are considered. In addition, signals which are collected at the transmission system modeled by electro magnetic transient program (EMTPRV) under the dynamic condition and the single line-to-ground fault are also used.

A Fractional Fourier Transform-Based Approach for Gas-Insulated Switchgear Partial Discharge Recognition,2019,['Extension Fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) Fractal parameters Partial discharge (PD)'],,"Partial discharge (PD) is very likely to deteriorate the insulating materials in power facilities. For this sake, PD detection and pattern recognition are treated as an effective approach to diagnosing the high-voltage insulation of power systems. A novel PD feature extraction approach for defect pattern recognition of a gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) is developed and then presented in this paper, using fractional Fourier transform (FrFT). A PD detector is utilized to measure the PD signal of the GIS using an ultra high frequency sensor, which is first transformed to its FrFT as the order ranges from 0 to 1. A 3D characteristic spectrum is then constructed, according to which the fractal parameters are extracted as the constituents of the cluster domains of defect types. Extension matter-element models of the PD defect types are then established according to the experimentally derived PD features. Subsequently, the PD defect type can be directly identified using the correlation degree between a tested pattern and the matter-element models. The pattern recognition performance is investigated on 80 sets of PD patterns, and the performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated accordingly. High accuracy, accompanied with high tolerance, was reached in the presence of noise interference using FrFT."
A response surface modelling approach for multi-objective optimization of composite plates,2019,"['FE-surrogate', 'metamodel', 'multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA)', 'multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO)', 'pareto front']",,"Despite the rapid advancement in computing resources, many real-life design and optimization problems in structural engineering involve huge computation costs. To counter such challenges, approximate models are often used as surrogates for the highly accurate but time intensive finite element models. In this paper, surrogates for first-order shear deformation based finite element models are built using a polynomial regression approach. Using statistical techniques like Box-Cox transformation and ANOVA, the effectiveness of the surrogates is enhanced. The accuracy of the surrogate models is evaluated using statistical metrics like R2, R2adj, R2pred and Q2F3. By combining these surrogates with nature-inspired multi-criteria decision-making algorithms, namely multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) and multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), the optimal combination of various design variables to simultaneously maximize fundamental frequency and frequency separation is predicted. It is seen that the proposed approach is simple, effective and good at inexpensively producing a host of optimal solutions."
Influence factors of non-uniform phase transformation in hot stamping process of ultra-high-strength steel sheet,2019,['Ultra-high-strength steel Cooling rates Hot stamping process Non-uniform phase transformation Heat transfer coefficient Simulation'],,"In the hot stamping process of ultra-high-strength steel sheets, it is a significant issue to reveal the nonuniformity of cooling rate in space–time domain by finite element method and even uncover the inner cause, which contributes to the further adjustment of the phase transformation. In this work, a series of heat transfer experiments between dies and sheets were conducted on the self-developed experimental apparatus. The temperature evolution curves of die and BR1500HS ultra-high-strength steel sheets under different pressures and holding time were obtained. Moreover, the transient heat transfer coefficients (HTC) under different mean interface temperatures and pressures were calculated by the inverse heat transfer algorithm. Subsequently, based on the HTC curves, a thermal–mechanical-phase dynamic coupling finite element model was developed for modeling the hot stamping process, and a series of simulations for analyzing the non-uniform microstructures distribution in hot stamping parts were implemented. Finally, the simulation results were validated by actual hot stamping experiments. Two significant influence factors on the nonuniform distribution of microstructures were summarized as follows: the existence of incomplete contact between steel sheets and dies due to the sheet thickness reduction in sidewall and circular bead regions, and the temperature differences between dies and steel sheets."
A numerical study on group quantile regression models,2019,"['group penalty', 'penalized quantile regression', 'variable selection']",,"Grouping structures in covariates are often ignored in regression models. Recent statistical developments considering grouping structure shows clear advantages; however, reflecting the grouping structure on the quantile regression model has been relatively rare in the literature. Treating the grouping structure is usually conducted by employing a group penalty. In this work, we explore the idea of group penalty to the quantile regression models. The grouping structure is assumed to be known, which is commonly true for some cases. For example, group of dummy variables transformed from one categorical variable can be regarded as one group of covariates. We examine the group quantile regression models via two real data analyses and simulation studies that reveal the beneficial performance of group quantile regression models to the non-group version methods if there exists grouping structures among variables."

Dynamic Analysis of Construction Safety Risk and Visual Tracking of Key Factors based on Behavior-based Safety and Building Information Modeling,2019,"['automatic rule checking', 'behavior-based safety', 'building information modeling', 'construction safety risk', 'dynamic analysis', 'grey clustering', 'grey relational analysis']",,"Construction has long been seen as a high-risk industry. Many studies conduct risk management by controlling construction risk indicators, but few studies associate risk indicators with time and space to propose long-term risk management methods. Therefore, this study proposes a dynamic analysis and visual tracking method based on behavior-based safety (BBS). This study establishes a BBS observation checklist and records workers’ unsafe behavior. The risk level of unsafe behavior is then determined by grey clustering model. When a high risk occurs, an improved grey correlation model is used to track key indicators that affect risk. In order to achieve visual risk management, this study develops semantic logic to predefine the relationship between components and space.

"합천호의 장기간 (2002~2017) 부영양화 특성, 경험적 모델 분석 및 몬순강도에 따른 시공간적 이화학적 수질 변이",2019,"['인', 'P', '수질', '부영양화', '경험적 모델', '엽록소-a', 'PHOSPHORUS', 'WATER QUALITY', 'EUTROPHICATION', 'EMPRICAL MODEL', 'CHLOROPHYLL-A']","본 연구는 합천호에서 2002~2017년까지 16년간의 장기간 동안 수질변수를 이용하여 부영양화 특성, 경험적 모델분석 및 몬순강도에 따른 수질변이 특성을 분석하였다. 장기간의 연별 수질 분석에서 합천호는 중영양 ~부영양 상태로 분석되었고, 계절별 수질분석에서 부영양화 현상은 하절기 이후 심화되는 것으로 나타났다. 장기간의 수질변이 특성은 유역의 점오염원 및 비점 오염원이 크게 변하지 않는 상황 하에서 매년 강우 사상 (집중 강우 vs. 약한 강우) 및 계절적인 강우강도에 의해 조절되는 것으로 분석되었다. 총인(TP), 총질소(TN), 생물학적 산소요구량(BOD) 및 이온 농도변화는 건기해(Dry year)와 홍수해 (Wet year)의 비교분석에서 뚜렷한 차이를 보여 영양염류, 유기물 농도 및 이온농도 변동에 가장 중요한 역할을 하는 것으로 분석되었다. 특히, 수질 변수 중 매년 영양염 지표(TP, TN), 유기물 지표(BOD, COD), 총 부유물질 농도 및 1차생산력의 지표 (Chl-a)는 강수량과 정상관관계를 보였다. 녹조의 지표인 Chl-a 농도는 총인, 총질소, 및 BOD와 높은 상관관계를 보여, 타 호수처럼 영양염의 과도한 증가시기에 Chl-a농도가 낮아지는 특성과는 차이를 보였다. Log-전환된 총질소, 총인 및 Chl-a에 대한 경험적 모델(Empirical model) 분석에 따르면, Chl-a 농도는 인(phosphorus) 농도에 의해 1차적으로 조절되며, 질소(N)농도는 유의한 영향을 주지 않는 것으로 나타났다. 이는 Log10TN, Log10TP, Log10CHL의 상류, 중류, 하류구간에 대한 공간적 회귀분석에서 총인과 Chl-a는 p <0.005의 유의적인 상관관계를 나타내었으나 총질소와 Chl-a는 p > 0.005의 결과를 보여, 녹조번성에 대해 인(P)이 핵심역할을 하는 것으로 분석 되었다. 또한, 총질소와 총인 모두 Chl-a와 댐에 가까운 하류구간(Lacustrine zone)에 비해 상류구간(Riverine zone)에서 더 유의적인 결과를 보여, 상류역에서 무기성 부유물의 농도의 영향에 의한 광제한 효과(Light limitation)가 거의 나타나지 않는 것으로 분석되었다.","The objective of this study was to analyze eutrophication characteristics, empirical model analysis, and variation of water quality according to monsoon intensity in Hapcheon Reservoir for 16 years from 2002 to 2017. Long-term annual water quality analysis showed that Hapcheon Reservoir was in a meso-nutrition to eutrophic condition, and the eutrophic state intensified after the summer monsoon. Annual rainfall volume (high vs. low rainfall) and the seasonal intensity in each year were the key factors that regulate the long-term water quality variation provided that there is no significant change of the point- and non-point source in the watershed. Dry years and wet years showed significant differences in the concentrations of TP, TN, BOD, and conductivity, indicating that precipitation had the most direct influence on nutrients and organic matter dynamics. Nutrient indicators (TP, TN), organic pollution indicators (BOD, COD), total suspended solids, and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), which was an estimator of primary productivity, had significant positive relations (p<0.05) with precipitation. The Chl-a concentration, which is an indicator of green algae, was highly correlated with TP, TN, and BOD, which differed from other lakes that showed the lower Chl-a concentration when nutrients increased excessively. Empirical model analysis of log-transformed TN, TP, and Chl-a indicated that the Chl-a concentration was linearly regulated by phosphorus concentration, but not by nitrogen concentration. Spatial regression analysis of the riverine, transition, and lacustrine zones of log10TN, log10TP, and log10CHL showed that TN and Chl-a had significant relations (p<0.005) while TN and Chl-a had p > 0.05, indicating that phosphorus had a key role in the algal growth. Moreover, the higher correlation of both log10TP and log10TN to log10CHL in the riverine zone than the lacustrine zone indicated that there was little impact of inorganic suspended solids on the light limitation in the riverine zone."
Transformational Leadership and Depressive Symptoms in Germany: Validation of a Short Transformational Leadership Scale,2019,"['Depression', 'Leadership', 'Occupational health', 'Germany']",,"Objectives: The objective of the present study was to validate a shortened transformational leadership (TL) scale (12 items) comprising core TL behaviour and to test the associations of this shortened TL scale with depressive symptoms. Methods: The study used cross-sectional data from 1632 employees of the overall workforce of a middle-sized German company (51.6% men; mean age, 41.35 years; standard deviation, 9.4 years). TL was assessed with the German version of the Transformational Leadership Inventory and depressive symptoms with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The structural validity of the core TL scale was assessed with confirmatory factor analysis. Associations with depressive symptoms were estimated with structural equation modelling and adjusted logistic regression. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling showed better model fit for the core TL than for the full TL score.

To do so, this study first examined the relationship between transformational leadership and employee engagement.Then the study investigated whether Korean cultural values, such as power distance orientation and psychological collectivism, moderate the relationship between transformational leadership and employee engagement. In addition, the study examined the effects of transformational leadership on employee engagement, as mediated by psychological empowerment.Data from a survey were collected and analyzed from 265 employees with at least one year of experience in Korean for-profit organizations in South Korea. Statistical techniques including moderated multiple regression, and structural equation modeling were mainly used to test the seven hypotheses.The findings of this study indicated that transformational leadership, psychological collectivism, and psychological empowerment were identified as potential strong leverage points to enhance employee engagement. Specifically, transformational leadership and psychological collectivism positively predicted employee engagement. In addition, psychological empowerment fully mediated the influence of transformational leadership on employee engagement. However, power distance orientation did not significantly affect employee engagement, and both power distance orientation and psychological collectivism did not moderate the relationship between transformational leadership and employee engagement.The findings of this study could provide the conceptual basis for specific programs and HR interventions that are designed to promote employee engagement, transformational leadership, and psychological empowerment in organizations. Implications from both theoretical and practical standpoints were discussed and several recommendations for future research were presented as well."

자기 공진형 무선전력전송 시스템의 효율 향상을 위한 변압기 적용 시스템 모델 분석,2019,"['Wireless Power Transfer', 'Magnetic Resonance Modeling', 'Inductive link', 'Q-factor']",,"As the mobile devices develop, the contact type wireless power transmission technologies face its limitation, and there are demands for convenient charging systems. Under the demands, non-contacting wireless power transmission system has been studied using magnetic resonance. Magnetic resonance type system uses four coils to transmit electrical power further. However, the 4-coil system has disadvantages in its size of transmission/receiving coils and difficulties in impedance matching. To improve the 4-coil system, 2-coil wireless power transmission system with transformers is proposed and analyzed. The existence of the transformers at the transmission part and the receiving part make the impedance matching between the system and the load comfortably and make the 2-coil system transmit power further. Circuit simulation is used to analyze the power transmission coefficient of the proposed 2-coil system with the 4-coil system. It can be seen through the simulation that the 2-coil wireless power transmission system with the transformers has analogous power transmission coefficient to that of the 4-coil wireless power transmission system. As a result, the wireless power transmission system can be made into a smaller size by using transformers in the 2-coil wireless power transmission system."

The effect of transformational leadership on team creativity: sequential mediating effect of employee’s psychological safety and creativity,2019,"['Transformational leadership', 'team creativity', 'psychological safety', 'sequential mediation', 'multi-level analysis']",,"Many scholars and practitioners have acknowledged the importance of transformation leadership as a critical catalyst of creativity in an organization. But, current research on the association between TL and creativity has some limitations because they have mainly focused on the individual employee’s creativity with a single mediator and a single-level analysis. As firms increasingly rely on ‘teams’ to enhance their innovation, however, we need to take into account factors that affect team-level creativity. To address this issue, we attempt to find underlying mechanisms which drive the relation between transformational leadership and team-level creativity. Grounded on a group creativity model, we argue that transformational leadership improves team creativity through employee’s psychological safety and subsequently facilitating his or her individual-level creativity. To test the hypotheses, we conducted a multi-level structural equation modeling analysis by utilizing a survey of 196 employees of 52 teams in South Korea. The result shows that our hypotheses are supported. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed along with limitations and future research directions."
The Effects of Retinoic Acid and MAPK Inhibitors on Phosphorylation of Smad2/3 Induced by Transforming Growth Factor β1,2019,"['Transforming Growth Factor Beta', 'Retinoic Acid', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'MEKs', 'Smad Proteins']",,"Background: Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), retinoic acid (RA), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and MEK signaling play critical roles in cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. We investigated the effect of RA and the role of these signaling molecules on the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 (p-Smad2/3) induced by TGF-β1. Methods: A549 epithelial cells and CCD-11Lu fibroblasts were incubated and stimulated with or without alltrans RA (ATRA) and TGF-β1 and with MAPK or MEK inhibitors. The levels of p-Smad2/3 were analyzed by western blotting. For animal models, we studied three experimental mouse groups: control, bleomycin, and bleomycin+ATRA group. Changes in histopathology, lung injury score, and levels of TGF-β1 and Smad3 were evaluated at 1 and 3 weeks. Results: When A549 cells were pre-stimulated with TGF-β1 prior to RA treatment, RA completely inhibited the p-Smad2/3. However, when A549 cells were pre-treated with RA prior to TGF-β1 stimulation, RA did not completely suppress the p-Smad2/3. When A549 cells were pre-treated with MAPK inhibitor, TGF-β1 failed to phosphorylate Smad2/3. In fibroblasts, p38 MAPK inhibitor suppressed TGF-β1–induced p-Smad2. In a bleomycin-induced lung injury mouse model, RA decreased the expression of TGF-β1 and Smad3 at 1 and 3 weeks. Conclusion: RA had inhibitory effects on the phosphorylation of Smad induced by TGF-β1 in vitro , and RA also decreased the expression of TGF-β1 at 1 and 3 weeks in vivo . Furthermore, pre-treatment with a MAPK inhibitor showed a preventative effect on TGF-β1/Smad phosphorylation in epithelial cells. As a result, a combination of RA and MAPK inhibitors may suppress the TGF-β1–induced lung injury and fibrosis."

To solve the typography transfer problem, we treat the problem as an image-to-image translation problem, and propose an unbalanced u-net architecture based on Generative Adversarial Network(GAN). Unlike traditional balanced u-net architecture, architecture we proposed consists of two subnets: (1) an unbalanced u-net is responsible for transferring specified fonts style to another, while maintaining semantic and structure information; (2) an adversarial net. Our model uses a compound loss function that includes a L1 loss, a constant loss, and a binary GAN loss to facilitate generating desired target fonts. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed network leads to more stable training loss, with faster convergence speed in cheat loss, and avoids falling into a degradation problem in generating loss than balanced u-net."

Results indicated that school climates, including affiliation climate, innovation climate, and justice climate, were significantly affected by school heads’ transformational leadership. All these three school climates had positive effects on students’ modernity, and partially mediated the relationship between school heads’ transformational leadership and students’ modernity. These three mediating variables accounted for 35.1% of the total indirect effects; the innovation climate accounted for 15.6% of the total indirect effects, followed by justice climate (11.7%) and affiliation climate (7.8%). Results suggest that school climates are important factors that need special attention when school heads wish to develop students’ modernity. In the implementation of transformational leadership, the combination of school climates and the establishment of innovation, justice, and affiliation climates should be emphasized."

To improve the performance of the estimation algorithm, a nonlinear batch filter, based on the unscented transform (UT) that overcomes the disadvantages of the least-squares (LS) batch filter, is utilized. The LS and UT batch filter algorithms are verified through numerical simulation analysis using artificial optical measurements. We use the real optical observation data of a low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite, Cryosat-2, observed from optical wide-field patrol network (OWL-Net), to verify the performance of the POD software developed. The effects of light travel time, annual aberration, and diurnal aberration are considered as error models to correct OWL-Net data. As a result of POD, measurement residual and estimated state vector of the LS batch filter converge to the local minimum when the initial orbit error is large or the initial covariance matrix is smaller than the initial error level. However, UT batch filter converges to the global minimum, irrespective of the initial orbit error and the initial covariance matrix."
"Efficiency of gerAa, tupA and ca transformation in Bacillus subtilis for self-healing of concrete cracks",2019,"['Bacterial spores', 'Gene modification', 'Self-healing', 'Concrete crack', 'Modeling.']",,"A genetic approach was proposed to modify the characteristics of Bacillus subtilis strain WB800 (B. subtilis WB800) for selfhealing of concrete cracks. Three genes, namely gerAa which encodes germination receptors activated by L-alanine, tupA which is responsible for the synthesis of teichuronopeptide, and ca which encodes carbonic anhydrase (CA) catalyzing the synthesis of carbonate ion, were separately transformed into WB800. To protect bacterial cells from being squeezed, microspheres were produced with microcrystal cellulose (MCC) before the introduction of bacteria into the specimens. The results showed that the modified B. subtilis expressing GerA achieved 39.9% of germination ratio compared to 17% by the original host cells. With the transformation of tupA, the modified strain demonstrated higher resistance to alkaline environments, tolerating pH as high as 11, while the original strain only tolerated pH 9. The modified strain expressing CA induced more calcium carbonate than the original cells. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) identified the produced precipitate to be calcite (CaCO3). Moreover, a mathematical model was developed to optimize the influential factors of calcium precipitation process. Finally, based on the above results, an effective self-healing of concrete crack was achieved. This study may provide a promising strategy to improve the efficiency of bacterial self-healing of concrete cracks."

Breakthrough curve approach was used to explain removal capacity of biomass in a continuous flow mode, using different operating parameters like bed height (5-30 cm), inlet metal concentration (100-300mg/L) and pH (3-5) of the solution, at a fixed flow rate of 2mL/min. Biosorption of Cu(II) favored with increased service time (breakthrough and exhaust time) of the column with an increase in pH of inlet solution. Maximum biosorption capacity (17.5mg/g) for Cu(II) was achieved at 5 cm bed height, pH 5 and 300 mg/L influent Cu(II) concentration. Findings suggested that Ficus religiosa branch powder takes less service time and thus triggers fast removal of metal ions. Bed depth service time (BDST), Thomas and Yoon-Nelson models were effectively applied to the breakthrough data. The study indicated that the immobilized powdered branches could be used for the effective removal of Cu(II) ions in a continuous flow mode."

Thus recently embarked social agreement for the conflict of taxi & platform service would be a meaningful practice for continuous similar conflicts.From this point of view, this paper applies to ‘taxi vs. car pool service conflict’, the ‘Consensus Building Approach based on NMIV(Negotiation Modeling for Integrative Value Accumulation)’, which defines negotiation as network composing market. Integrative perspective based on norms, economic, and psychological research supporting market incentive of Adam Smith, is applied through the frameworks. The procedural frameworks transform each party’s persistent frame and fragmented assertion to the interactive process of analytical understanding on each other’s multi-dimensional interests, drawing integrative agendas, creative packages, and distributive agreement based on the acceptable principles. Negotiation is a Pareto optimizing process to understand interests of each own, others and environment around the agenda and to draw better outcome of each party and society. In this process, integrative perspective, methodology and practical frameworks which are consistently shared among the parties could be material facilitation."
Evaluation of benzene residue in edible oils using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,2019,"['benzene adulteration', 'edible oils', 'food safety', 'FTIR spectroscopy', 'rapid measurement']",,"The use of food grade hexane (FGH) for edible oil extraction is responsible for the presence of benzene in the crude oil. Benzene is a Group 1 carcinogen and could pose a serious threat to the health of consumer. However, its detection still depends on classical methods using chromatography which requires a rapid non-destructive detection method. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy combined with multivariate analysis to detect and quantify the benzene residue in edible oil (sesame and cottonseed oil). Oil samples were adulterated with varying quantities of benzene, and their FTIR spectra were acquired with an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) method. Optimal variables for a partial least-squares regression (PLSR) model were selected using the variable importance in projection (VIP) and the selectivity ratio (SR) methods. The developed PLS models with whole variables and the VIP- and SR-selected variables were validated against an independent data set which resulted in R2 values of 0.95, 0.96, and 0.95 and standard error of prediction (SEP) values of 38.5, 33.7, and 41.7 mg/L, respectively. The proposed technique of FTIR combined with multivariate analysis and variable selection methods can detect benzene residuals in edible oils with the advantages of being fast and simple and thus, can replace the conventional methods used for the same purpose."

Methods: To investigate the effect of RGE on the metastatic phenotypes of CRC cells, CT26 and HT29 cells were evaluated by using an adhesion assay, a wound-healing assay, an invasion assay, zymography, and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Western-blot analysis was conducted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of RGE, which showed an inhibitory effect on the transforming growth factor-${\beta}1$ ($TGF-{\beta}1$)-induced EMT in HT29 cells.

Results: RGE decreased the adhesion and migration ability of the CT26 cells and TGF-${\beta}1$-treated HT29 cells. The invasion ability was also reduced by RGE treatment through the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression and activity. Moreover, RGE suppressed the TGF-${\beta}1$-induced EMT via TGF-${\beta}1$/Smad-signaling-mediated Snail/E-cadherin expression in HT29 cells and lung tissue in CT26 tumor-bearing mice.

LPV Modeling and Tracking Control of Dissimilar Redundant Actuation System for Civil Aircraft,2019,"['Dissimilar redundant actuation system', 'force fighting', 'linear matrix inequality', 'linear parameter varying', 'optimization']",,"Dissimilar redundant actuation systems (DRAS) are in practice in advanced aircraft in order to increasereliability and to resolve the actuator failure issue due to common cause. This paper addresses the problem offorce fighting that occurs due to dynamics mismatch of two dissimilar actuators in DRAS and provides a method toachieve precise tracking of aircraft control surface. The nonlinear system dynamics are first transformed into linearparameter varying (LPV) form using recursive least square (RLS) method. The LPV observer based controller isthen designed to synchronize the positions of dissimilar actuators in DRAS and to drive the control surface smoothly.By applying linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), parameter dependent Lyapunov function (PDLF) is obtained toachieve global stability and to compute the controller and observer gains. To test controller according to realflight condition, an external disturbance signal that acts as air load is applied at the control surface input. Severalsimulations on the nonlinear system validate the dominant performance of proposed controller as compared to theexisting methods in literature."
Fast speaker adaptation using extended diagonal linear transformation for deep neural networks,2019,"['DNN acoustic modeling', 'DNN adaptation', 'DNN speech recognition', 'fast speaker adaptation', 'SVD adaptation']",,"This paper explores new techniques that are based on a hidden‐layer linear transformation for fast speaker adaptation used in deep neural networks (DNNs). Conventional methods using affine transformations are ineffective because they require a relatively large number of parameters to perform. Meanwhile, methods that employ singular‐value decomposition (SVD) are utilized because they are effective at reducing adaptive parameters. However, a matrix decomposition is computationally expensive when using online services. We propose the use of an extended diagonal linear transformation method to minimize adaptation parameters without SVD to increase the performance level for tasks that require smaller degrees of adaptation. In Korean large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) tasks, the proposed method shows significant improvements with error‐reduction rates of 8.4% and 17.1% in five and 50 conversational sentence adaptations, respectively. Compared with the adaptation methods using SVD, there is an increased recognition performance with fewer parameters."

First, the characteristics of the adolescents who are the key audience of the security education are changing. The penetration rate of smartphone is over 90 percent, and the young prefer smart learnings to the traditional learnings. Second, the 4th industrial revolution is greatly transforming the educational environment through the newly invented technology such as AI. VR, AR, and big data. Instructional media is being combined with the new technology and the national security education is not an exception. According to these facts, a thorough review of national security education targeting adolescents is required.  To solve the above problems, this study combines educational engineering with instructional media via technology. In order to design the security education for the adolescents, ASSURE model is selected among other instructional design models. There are two reasons of selecting the ASSURE model. First, ASSURE model, which combines both education and media, provides a starting point for adopting the most suitable instructional media for the education of the adolescents. Second, ASSURE model is a practical model that is simple in the instructional design and easy to use in the field. This allows the military personnel in charge of the national security education to easily and immediately adopt the model to the current system.  Beyond the theoretical discussion which links national security education with newly invented technology through an instructional design model, this paper designed and implemented security education for the Korean adolescents through the ASSURE model. This study can be evaluated as an attempt to increase the responsiveness and competitiveness of national security education for the adolescents in 4<SUP>th</SUP> industrial revolution."

TELEMAC 수리모형을 활용한 좌표변환 및 통계기반 하천공간 보간법의 적용성 평가,2019,"['Interpolation', 'Kriging', 'Coordinate Transformation', 'River', 'Hydraulics']",,"Climate change and industrialization in recent years threaten water resources, degrading water quantity and quality. Various research activities are in progress, to cope with such crises in water resources. Also, various numerical models in hydraulics and hydrology are applied to simulate water quantity and quality in rivers and lakes. Reliable numerical simulation depends primarily on accurate bathymetry data of rivers and lakes. Spatial interpolation is thus used to make up the entire topography of the computational domain with a limited number of bathymetry data. However, conventional methods of spatial interpolation cannot properly make up the river topography, influenced by flow direction. Therefore, in this study, we developed and tested an anisotropic spatial interpolation method consisting of statistics-based interpolation (i.e. kriging) and coordinate transformation, and compared the new method with conventional interpolation methods (i.e. inverse distance weighting and spline). A free-surface finite element computational fluid dynamic model (TELEMAC, EDF, France) was also applied to test water flow over the interpolated topography. The anisotropic ordinary kriging method, combined with coordinate transformation from the cartesian (XY) to the curvilinear orthogonal (SN) system, was found to be the most reliable and accurate interpolation method. The anisotropic spatial interpolation for a river topography will enhance accuracy and reliability of hydraulic and hydrological simulation for effective water resource management."

However, more and more countries have begun to implement cultural economic strategies in order to seek cultural industries to become the emerging pillar of the national economy.  Since the implementation of an opening and reform policy, China has achieved the rapid growth of the economy. With the growth of national income, the demand of culture is also increasing. China is a big manufacturing country in the world. Hence, traditional industries have high resource consumption, serious pollution and overcapacity. There is an urgent need for economic transformation and structural adjustment. Due to its high technology content, low resource consumption and low environmental pollution, the Chinese cultural and creative industries have typical characteristics of low energy consumption, high added value, and environmental protection, which provide strong support for the transformation and upgrading of the national economy and the improvement of quality and efficiency. The economy has maintained an increasingly important role in maintaining high-speed growth. Under the new normal of economic development, when the structural reform of the supply side is fully promoted, the cultural industry continues to accelerate its development and is becoming a new engine for economic and social development.  Nowadays, the Chinese cultural industry has developed relatively fast and the contribution rate to the national economy is steadily increasing. However, it has many problems such as the weakness of Chinese cultural industry in general ability, the structure of cultural industry is unreasonable, other industries and collaboration system are not built up.

The 1979 feature-length film, <Nezha-NaoHai(那吒鬧海)> produced by the Shanghai Art and Film Institute, is considered one of the most popular uses of the traditional image of the character. The work inherits the tradition of “Chinese School of Animation(中國動畫學派)”, which emphasizes ""Chinese characteristics."" The story of Nezha, which has been transformed into various forms, including novels, feature animation for theaters, and television animation, has been a huge success in 2019 with an animated film called <Nezha-MoTongJiangShi(那吒·魔童降世)> recording a staggering 49.7 billion yuan in Chinese animation history. The heroism of a society is shaped in a completely different way according to socioeconomic development, major propagation media, and changes in public taste. The 1979 <Nezha-NaoHai> is a work that shows China's cultural orientation before the opening of the market, and the 2019 <Nezha-MoTongJiangShi> shows the cultural changes of Chinese society through the 40-year-old reform and opening-up policy. Noting this point, We wanted to compare and analyze how the Chinese traditional hero figure of ""Nezha"" was well received by the audience of the time through the characters of ""Nezha"", which were shaped differently under the different period conditions of 2019 and 1979, and based on these analyses, it wanted to identify changes in Chinese society and popular culture that span 40 years. First of all, we could analyze what each symbol means through the character's apparent differences, and confirm that the differences in these features ultimately reflect different period conditions: 1979 and 2019. ""Nezha"" is a kind of cultural archetype that represents the traditional Chinese hero figure. However, if we emphasize the traditional image of the 1979 <Nezha-NaoHai>, the 2019 <Nezha-MoTongJiangShi> reflects the image of a new cultural entity in China's modern society, the 'Post 80, 'Post 90. This confirms once again the fact that different generations of animation works based on the same original story reflect the time-space world conditions of the society and reflect its period sensibility."

In terms of media industry strategy, digital transformation can be understood as a strategy in which a media firm integrates innovative digital technologies to change its business model and establish a new direction for the industry. Over-the-Top (OTT) reflects this digital transformation phenomenon. OTT is recognized as the next generation of media that will bring innovation and efficiency in media industry with the proliferation of digital transformation phenomenon.The OTT video market is constantly growing. For instance, as of January 2019, Netflix, a leader among the global OTT service providers, had 139 million streaming subscribers. Netflix’s global streaming services are currently available in more than 200 countries around the world. OTT service providers such as Netflix and Youtube provide a platform service for viewing various video contents anytime, anywhere through internet-enabled various digital devices.In addition, OTT has evolved in various types to be regarded as a spectrum. However, previous studies have not examined the intention to use these various types of paid OTTs. For example, few studies examined intention to use paid Advertising Video-on-demand (AVOD) and Subscription Video-on-demand (SVOD). Also, the effects of original content preference, personalized content recommendation preference, and perceived cost to users on the intention to use AVOD and SVOD, have not been sufficiently examined. In addition, studies on the substitutability of the existing pay TV service and the OTT service, which may play an important part in the debate over the OTT regulatory model, have not been sufficiently analyzed.Therefore, based upon attribute theory and innovation diffusion theory (IDT), this study examines the intention to use subscription VOD and paid advertising VOD in consideration of four constructs. Specifically, employing a survey method, this study examine whether original content preference, personalized content recommendation preference, and perceived cost from the attribute theory, compatibility, trialability, and observability from the innovation diffusion theory, ritualized use and instrumental use from the viewing orientation, perceived substitutability of the existing pay TV service and the OTT service affect intention to use subscription VOD service (Research Model I) and paid advertising VOD service (Research Model II).The results of the hierarchical regression analysis demonstrate that factors such as compatibility, trialability, observability and instrumental use affect the intention to use subscription VOD service. Also, original content preference and perceived cost, compatibility, observability and viewing orientation variables such as ritualized use and instrumental use affect user intention of paid advertising VOD.Comparing the results of the two models, the perceived cost affects the intention to use the paid advertising VOD, but the perceived cost variable was relatively weak in explaining the intention to use the subscription VOD model. It was also found that the ritualized use variable affects the intention to use paid advertising VOD only. In addition, it was found that the OTT’s perceived substitutability of paid broadcasting service is not statistically significant in both the paid advertising VOD model and subscription VOD model, which implies that the OTT service is not yet recognized as a substitute for the existing paid TV services."

More than ever, multicultural education is becoming important not only in general education but also in Christian education. However, the multicultural education that has been discussed so far in Korea has shown an attitude of accepting the Western multicultural education uncritically. Especially, the “multiculturalism” model among the types classified by Castle & Miller is at the center. Therefore, this paper focuses on the discourse of multicultural education, and then presents a “Korean multiculturalism model” on the basis of the discourse. More specifically, this paper explored the following three research themes. First, this paper critically examined the current discourse on multicultural education in relation to Christian education. The current multicultural education theories have been pointed out to be largely governed by the contribution approach and the additive approach. In addition, it is necessary to study the transformation approach and social action approach, especially the type of reconceptualists approach emphasizing religious dialogue and religious peace. Second, this paper critically examined the limits of multiculturalism and its alternatives. In particular, the US Trump Administration's nationality preference policy called by “America First” has had a great impact on multicultural education around the world, suggesting the need for the Korean multiculturalism. Third, this study presented a “pungryudo(風流道) model” as a concrete model of religious peace model as a model of Korean multiculturalism. This is a multicultural education model centering on religious dialogue and can be used as a model to show the multicultural self-identity of diaspora-Koreans, who are scattered around the world, to 8 millions."

In particular, the moderating effects of person-environment fit were regarded as a contextual factor. The results showed that transformational leadership had a positive impact on an individual's task performance. Also it has been shown that the relationship between transformational leadership and an individual's task performance was moderated by person-environmental fits including person-job fit and person-organization fit. In order words, the stronger the perosn-environment fits the stronger the relationship between transformational leadership and an individual's task performance.This study addressed that transformational leadership has a positive impact on the effectiveness of individual level. These results contributes to expanding the knowledge of existing studies of transformational leadership. Existing studies has shown that transformational leadership had a positive impact on individual attitudes and performance. However, little has been known about the context where the effects could be increased or decreased. The results of the study presented that person-job fit and person-organization fit were critical situational factors which could bring change on the relationship between transformational leadership and its outcomes.This study has practical implications as well as theoretical implications. One is that transformational leadership promotes a sense of common goal. The more they approach problems in various ways, the more they help not only achieve their own goals. The requirements charged to individuals in an organization needs to clearly present specific guidance on the responsibilities and roles given by groups or teams. Additionally, organizations need to make efforts to inform members that individual efforts to achieve common goals can be helpful in personal task performance due to knowledge, information, experience, and know-how acquired through the interaction of the process of trying to gain common goals.Managers need to develop their own leadership competency model. It is possible to design a sub-factor of transformational leadership in the model. With the leadership competency model, managers can design leadership development programs and modify current development programs. Thus, the development of HR analytics techniques contributes to the improvement of individual and organizational performance by more systematically matching the skills, knowledge, experience, achievement, characteristics and abilities required by an organization or team.Although it was supported that transformational leadership has a positive impact on an individual's task performance, and that person-environment fit can strengthen the relationship, there are several limitations. In this line, this study also presents some agenda for future studies."

The modeling subsystem’s functionality is to discover and analyze workflow models via a theoretical modeling methodology like ICN, to graphically define them via a graphical representation notation like BPMN, and to systematically deploy those graphically defined models onto the enacting subsystem by transforming into their textual models represented by a standardized workflow process definition language like XPDL. Before deploying those defined workflow models, it is very important to inspect its syntactical correctness as well as its structural properness to minimize the loss of effectiveness and the depreciation of efficiency in managing the corresponding workflow models. In this paper, we are particularly interested in verifying very large-scale and massively parallel workflow models, and so we need a sophisticated analyzer to automatically analyze those specialized and complex styles of workflow models. One of the sophisticated analyzers devised in this paper is able to analyze not only the structural complexity but also the data-sequence complexity, especially. The structural complexity is based upon combinational usages of those control-structure constructs such as subprocesses, exclusive-OR, parallel-AND and iterative-LOOP primitives with preserving matched pairing and proper nesting properties, whereas the data-sequence complexity is based upon combinational usages of those relevant data repositories such as data definition sequences and data use sequences. Through the devised and implemented analyzer in this paper, we are able eventually to achieve the systematic verifications of the syntactical correctness as well as the effective validation of the structural properness on those complicate and large-scale styles of workflow models. As an experimental study, we apply the implemented analyzer to an exemplary large-scale and massively parallel workflow process model, the Large Bank Transaction Workflow Process Model, and show the structural complexity analysis results via a series of operational screens captured from the implemented analyzer."

The proposed mathematical model satisfies zero transverse shear strain at the top and bottom of the plate. On the basis of the cubic variation of thickness coordinate in in-plane displacement fields of the present mathematical model, a 2D finite element (FE) model was developed including skew transformations in the mathematical model. No shear correction factor is required in the present formulation and damping effect was also incorporated. This is the first FE implementation considering a cubic variation of thickness coordinate in in-plane displacement fields including skew transformations to solve the forced vibration problem of composite skew plates. The effect of transverse shear and rotary inertia was incorporated in the present model. The Newmark-β scheme was adapted to perform time integration from step to step. The C0 FE formulation was implemented to overcome the problem of C1 continuity associated with the cubic variation of thickness coordinate in in-plane displacement fields. The numerical studies showed that the present 2D FE model predicts the result close to the analytical results. Many new results varying different parameter such as skew angles, boundary conditions, etc. were presented."

Second, it is not possible to find the statistically reliable effect of digital transformation investment on productivity in estimating the simultaneous equation model composed mainly of productivity transmission mechanism such as digital transformation investment, human capital, worker education and reeducation, economic growth, and productivity variables.

Conformal Frame Dependence on Cosmological Observations in Scalar-Tensor Theories of Gravity,2019,"['Conformal transformation', 'Modified gravity theories', 'Dark energy', 'Cosmological observabales']",,"Cosmological observations provide more accurate values both for the background evolution of the Universe and for the structure formation. These values are given by the so-called dark energy equation of state, $\omega$, and the growth index parameter, $\gamma$. From these observed parameters, one can reconstruct the model functions in scalar-tensor gravity theories. However, there is a long-standing debate about the (in)equality between conformally transformed frames in scalar-tensor gravity models and some cosmological observables have been shown to be frame independent and others frame dependent. We focus on the cosmological evolutions of the frame-dependent observables, which are functions of the frame-independent parameter, the redshift. Thus, if one measures the cosmological parameters $\omega$ and $\gamma$ from the frame-dependent cosmological observables in one specific frame, then all of the other observables should also be interpreted in that frame with the same cosmological parameters obtained from that measurement. If one analyzes the same observables in another frame, then the obtained cosmological parameters should be different from those of the original frame. This explicitly shows the frame dependence of cosmological observables. Also, our method provides a model-independent analysis of scalar-tensor theories of gravity models about various observables in both frames."

First, it is necessary to prioritize unorganized organization and change the organizational structure and culture of the union so that it can be transformed into ‘organizing union’. Second, the necessity of a ‘field enlargement’ strategy.During the 2000s, Korean Metal Workers’ Union(KMWU) has been organizing small and medium-sized workers and the unorganized in large factory sites. But the KMWU has been developing strategic organizing projects by accumulating unorganized funds because of the limits of daily organizing projects since 2015, The results revealed so far are not enough to transform the organization into a ‘organizing union’ in terms of organizational system and resource mobilization. And there is a lack of a ‘field enlargement’ flow of organizing projects through mobilization and activation of members. This is because the leadership of large corporations and the identity of regular workers are the obstacles to organizing the unorganized. In the face of massive retirement of trade union members, the KMWU will also change its identity through the newly organized working class. How the KMWU’s identity comes down depends on the outcome of strategic organizing projects."

However, the distribution of data collected by the automatic measurement system in real time is often not followed by normal distribution. As the statistical analysis tools, the process capability index (PCI) has been used a lot as a measure of process capability analysis in the production site. However, PCI has been usually used without checking the normality test for the process data. Even though the normality assumption is violated, if the analysis method under the assumption of the normal distribution is performed, this will be an incorrect result and take a wrong action. When the normality assumption is violated, we can transform the non-normal data into the normal data by using an appropriate normal transformation method. There are various methods of the normal transformation. In this paper, we consider the Box-Cox transformation among them. Hence, the purpose of the study is to expand the analysis method for the multivariate process capability index using Box-Cox transformation. This study proposes the multivariate process capability index to be able to use according to both methodologies whether data is normally distributed or not. Through the computational examples, we compare and discuss the multivariate process capability index between before and after Box-Cox transformation when the process data is not normally distributed."

An Empirical Study on the Mechanism of College Students’ Green Consumption in China,2019,"['책임환경행위모형', '대학생녹색소비', '조절효과', 'responsible environmental behavior model', 'college students’green consumption', 'regulatory effect']",,"With the rapid development of the economy, the problems of environmental pollution, climate change and resource exhaustion have become increasingly prominent. With the rapid development of the global economy, the problems of environmental pollution, climate change and resource exhaustion have become increasingly prominent. For these environment problems, the international community has put forward the development model of low-carbon economy, required every country to change their production and consumption patterns, reduce carbon emissions and protect the environment in recent years. Faced with the pressure of international community and the requirement of domestic sustainable development, Chinese government has proposed to reform deeply and drive by innovation, foster ecological culture, and adhere to the development of green and low-carbon cycles. The construction of ecological civilization should start from young people, start from the education of family and school, and comprehensively accelerate the transformation of the whole people into a diligent, green and low-carbon way.The number of Chinese college students with a college degree or above is 3,017.54 million in 2018. A large number of college students with high-level scientific and culture are easy to accept new things and more concerned about the fate of human beings. Therefore, researching on the influencing factors and driving mechanism of college students’ green consumption is not only helpful to guide and educate the college students’ green consumption, but also to explore and cultivate the potential main force and future leaders of green consumption.Currently, the research on green consumption focuses on the analysis of consumers’ subjective will variables, while it involves individual objective ability and external situational factors, but mostly ignores the interaction between them and subjective will. Because green consumption is affected by subjective and objective factors, internal and external factors, it is necessary to introduce individual subjective will, individual objective ability and external factors into the green consumption model at the same time.Firstly, through sorting out and comparing the relevant research theories, it found that interpersonal behavior theory, environmental literacy model, responsible environmental behavior theory, planned behavior theory, attitude-behavior-condition theory, and value-belief-norm theory are the six most influential environmental behavior models. This paper proposes an improved responsible environmental behavior model through appropriately adjusting Hines’ responsible environmental behavior model. In combination with the characteristics of Chinese College students, environmental emotion, environmental problem cognition, environmental responsibility, social cognition, vipassana control, utility values, objective ability, subjective will, face culture and policy incentives are selected as the main influencing factors of green consumption, which are divided into three groups: individual subjective will, individual objective ability and external situational factors according to the improved responsible environmental behavior model.Secondly, the sample data of the impact mechanism of green consumption of university students are obtained through the analysis of 812 valid questionnaires issued and retrieved by junior college students, undergraduate students and doctoral students from four university towns.This data was tested for reliability and validity test, correlation analysis, hierarchical regression, multiple regression and adjustment effect analysis by SPSS and Amos.Thirdly, the relevant hypotheses are verified by different types of regression analysis methods. Simple regression analysis method is used to validate the relationship between subjective will and green consumption of assumes H1, the relationship between objective ability and green consumption of assumes H2; Hierarchical regre..."

It is well known that different methods produce quite different estimates for structural coefficients in a full model. How can we tell the best method?To answer it, we apply three parceling methods and the SEM with a second-order factor model to two sets of empirical data, obtained with MKTOR and MARKOR scales of market orientation. The multidimensionality of the scales has been well established both theoretically and empirically.This study shows that the four methods estimate the relationship between firms’ market orientation and performance differently from one another. We cannot tell which one gives the least biased estimate, because all of the four methods produce poor model fits, the only criterion extant research provides. We recommend the SEM method with a second-order factor model because it is well grounded on the domain sampling theory. If we fail to remove the facet specificity from a multidimensional scale, it would provide invalid empirical meaning for the construct it is supposed to measure and result in biased structural coefficient estimates."

To accomplish the purpose as such, the glyphs of the entry words in Zushoryo-bon Ruiju Myogi Sho are examined in contrast to Ishizuka Glyph Transition Model which is regarded in Sinosphere as the glyphic operation of Chinese characters having been transferred from Early Tang standard to Kaicheng standard. The preceding studies have concretely demonstrated the actuality of the model by extracting 212 character types for the cross-comparison between the indexical manuscripts of each standard, the standard manuscripts, so to speak. Meanwhile, it has been suggested that the above mentioned model be verified also for the glyphs in the dictionary of each era. As for the methodological approach, another 151 character types corresponding to the 212 types are extracted from Zushoryo-bon Ruiju Myogi Sho entry words and investigated as follows: first, each example is classified according to whether the character corresponds to that of the heading radical, and second, it is examined whether the individual glyph of each example corresponds to Early Tang standard or Kaicheng standard. Thus, the following conclusions are obtained: first, taken as a whole, the equivalent of Early Tang standard accounts for about 85 percent, which is not really discrepant from what Ishizuka Glyph Transition Model says to be ‘Japanese Standard’, and second, even so, a little over 7 percent follows Kaicheng standard. In fact, it was the 12th century when printed copies from the Song Dynasty were actively imported into Japan. And what can be interpreted from such a socio-historical context is that the glyphs of Kaicheng standard already established in the imported copies have brought about a partial change in the existing ‘Japanese standard’."

A broadband dielectric spectra test platform was established and an equivalent physical model of the valve side dry-type bushing of the converter transformer was developed. Different degrees of thermal aging were performed at 130 °C for 0, 4, 8, 16, and 32 days. In addition, variation of the complex permittivity and dielectric loss factors of epoxy resin impregnated paper at different temperatures and different degrees of aging was revealed. The dielectric spectra test results were fitted using the Havriliak-Negami (HN) relaxation model. The characteristic parameters were extracted, and the influences of temperature and aging on the characteristic parameters of the HN model were analyzed. The results show that in the low frequency range, temperature and aging exert greater influences on the complex permittivity. In the high frequency range, temperature and aging have smaller effect. The relaxation time and temperature satisfy the relationship of the Arrhenius equation, and the relaxation strength increases exponentially with increasing temperature. The relaxation time τ, the relaxation intensity Δε, the shape parameter α, and the shape parameter β can characterize the aging degree of paper insulation. A linear relationship between relaxation and aging times, and an exponential relationship between relaxation intensity and aging time were revealed."

Expression of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), α-smooth muscle actin(α-SMA), and collagen I in pancreatic tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. mRNA and protein levels of TGF-βreceptor 1 (TβR1), TβR2, and Smad2 in pancreatic tissues were determined by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively.Results: In the model group, hyperplasia of glandules around the glandular ducts, mitochondrial swelling of acinous cells, andsevere fibrosis were found. Interestingly, in the Matrine group, mitochondrial swelling was only found in a small number of acinouscells, and the fundamental structures of pancreatic tissues were intact. Moreover, pancreatic fibrosis was markedly alleviated.Comparing to the Sham group, expression of α-SMA, TGF-β1, and collagen I was sharply elevated in the Model group (p<0.05);however, their expressions were much lower in the Matrine group, compared to the Model group (p<0.05). Compared with theSham group, mRNA and protein levels of Smad2, TβR1, and TβR2 in the Model group were notably raised (p<0.05). However,their high expression was significantly downregulated in the Matrine group (p<0.05).Conclusion: Matrine suppressed pancreatic fibrosis by regulating TGF-β/Smad signaling in rats."

불완전정보하의 다요소의사결정을 위한 일반화된 선형계획법,2019,"['Multiple Attribute Decision Making(MADM)', 'Incomplete Information', 'Generalized Linear Programming']",,"This study is concerned with the use of incomplete information on both decision alternative scores and importance weights in multiple attribute decision making (MADM). Incomplete information implies various forms of ordinal and bound data on the alternative scores and weights, which often occurs in practice. In the case of incomplete information, two different mathematical programming models can be built to evaluate the alternatives, both of which become nonlinear programming problems. One scenario seeks to evaluate an alternative in the best scenario for the given incomplete information, also referred as the most optimistic evaluation approach. By contrast, the other scenario seeks the worst scenario, referred as the most pessimistic approach. The earlier work has resolved the optimistic evaluation problem, which transforms the nonlinear model into a linear programming model. However, knowing how to solve the pessimistic evaluation problem remains unclear for MADM with incomplete information. We therefore show in this study that the generalized linear programming techniques can solve the pessimistic evaluation problem, which alters the nonlinear model into a class of linear programming models. This scheme accomplishes a more complete evaluation because the non-dominated alternative evaluated under the worst scenario is superior to the non-dominated alternatives under the best scenario. An application of the software selection problem is also demonstrated."
On-line Auxiliary Input Signal Design for Active Fault Detection and Isolation Based on Set-membership and Moving Window Techniques,2019,"['Active fault detection and isolation', 'moving window technique', 'on-line auxiliary input signal design', 'set-membership method']",,"This paper presents an on-line auxiliary input signal design strategy based on set-membership and moving window techniques to deal with the problem of active fault detection and isolation. The goal of active fault detection and isolation is to design an auxiliary input signal, such that the nominal system output set and faulty systems output sets are separated each other after injecting the input signal. In this paper, the output sets are characterized by ellipsoids. First, an extended model of the system based on moving window technique is constructed, then an auxiliary input signal is calculated on-line based on the equivalent model. As the energy of the auxiliary input signal is restricted minimum to decrease the influence of the signal on the system, the design condition of active fault detection and isolation is transformed into an optimal problem. Furthermore, the fault is isolated by judging the actual system output belongs to which output ellipsoid of the faulty models, or determining the probability of the system output is in which faulty model when the output ellipsoids of faulty models are intersecting. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach."
인구구조의 변화와 새로운 법규범의 요청 : 저출산・고령사회기본법 비판,2019,"['demographic change', 'Framework Act on Low Birth Rate in an Aging Society', 'individual dignity', 'reproductive rights', 'diversity of families', '인구변동', '저출산･고령사회기본법', '개인의 존엄', '재생산권', '가족다양성']","이 논문은 한국 사회에서 급속하게 전개되고 있는 인구구조 변화와 관련하여 이에 대응하는 법제를 저출산･고령사회기본법을 중심으로 비판적으로 검토함으로써, 인구구조 변동의 진원지로서 가족의 변화에 대한 새로운 법규범의 필요성을 진단한다. 한국의 합계출산율은 유례를 찾기 어려울 정도로 낮은 수준을 나타내고 있으며, 고령화의 속도 역시 전 세계에서 가장 빠른 속도를 보이고 있다. 그 근저에는 만혼, 비혼의 증가 등 가족구성의 주요 기제인 혼인 상의 변화와 함께 이혼, 분거가족을 비롯한 비전형 가족의 증가를 포함하여 가족 및 가구구성에서 나타나는 중요한 변화가 작동하고 있다. 이 같은 추세는 일시적이거나 잠정적인 것이 아니며, 보편혼주의적인 결혼관의 약화와 기존의 ‘정상가족’ 모델의 해체 등에 의해 가족의 실질적 변화는 더욱 심화될 것으로 전망된다. 이와 관련하여 저출산･고령사회기본법은 인구구조 변화에 대한 위기론적 인식에 근거하는 대응적 입법의 성격을 가진다. 저출산･고령사회기본법은 그 목적과 기본이념, 국민의 의무 규정, 가족에 대한 관점 등에 있어 인구구조 및 가족의 변화에 대한 적절한 법규범을 새롭게 제시하기보다는 저출산･고령사회 문제를 국가주의와 발전주의에 귀속시키고, 출산 및 육아의 중요성을 국민의 의무와 연계시키며, 가족의 변화를 가족의 위기로 간주한다는 점에서 문제적이다. 이 논문은 국가주의와 발전주의를 탈피하여 개인의 존엄을 출발점으로 하고, 출산 및 육아에 대한 국민의 의무가 아니라 재생산의 권리에 초점을 둠으로써, 가족의 위기가 아니라 가족의 다양성을 수용하고 보장하는 새로운 법규범을 모색할 것을 요청하고 있다.","This study examines the necessity of new legal norms to respond to the change of family, which is the epicenter of rapid population transformation, particularly focusing on the Framework Act on Low Birth Rate in an Aging Society. The total fertility rate in South Korea is exceptionally low and its population is aging faster than in any other country. At the bottom lies the change of family, including an increase of non-married, deferred-marriage, divorced, and atypical families. This tendency is not temporary but expected to deepen along with a weakening of the ‘normal family’ model. The Framework Act is responsive legislation to this change. Regarding the purpose and basic principles of the Act, obligations of citizens, and conception of family, the Framework Act imputes the issue of low birthrate and an aging population to nationalism and developmentalism, relates childbirth and childcare to obligations of citizens, and considers family change as a crisis of family. This paper requests new legal norms, which do not start from nationalism but from individual dignity, is based on reproductive rights rather than the obligation of citizens, and embraces and guarantees the diversity of families."

However, this method may lead to unsatisfactory matching results if an appropriate initial solution is required for convergence of the objective function or if the objective function is confined to the local minima during the search. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method to physically reduce the search space by using geometric correction designed by the turntable and mathematical analysis to consider not only the performance of the geometric matching but also the computational complexity in constructing the 3D model of the object. This method proves that there is a geometric transformation between the structured light system and the turntable, and shows that the registration of the point clouds converted to the coordinates of the turntable can be performed quickly by only one-dimensional rotation transformation."

By the method of bilinear transform and inverse Z-transform, the line voltage based numerical models of the virtual motors are derived. Moreover, the relationship between the line voltage and phase current of the virtual motors is analyzed, which is used to calculate the phase current commands in the numerical models. Furthermore, the universal PHIL simulator is implemented and the real-time simulation is performed, and then the offline simulation with MATLAB software and the actual motor test are also performed to verify the simulator results.

The NOTCH signalling pathway may be involved in the development of fibrosis, myofibroblast formation and the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Activation of the NOTCH pathway leads to morphological, phenotypic and functional changes in epithelial cells. Furthermore, inhibition of Notch signalling prevent the development of fibrosis in different models, among them, bleomycin-induced fibrosis and in the Task-1 mause model.

Moreover, cases where foreign Kimchi is transformed illegally into Korean Kimchi are frequent, which impedes the expansion of Korean Kimchi exports. To sustain the Korean Kimchi industry in a situation where the domestic and overseas conditions are deteriorating, it is necessary to positively review the introduction of Kimchi into a geographical indication (GI) system. This study examined the intention of foreign consumers to purchase Korean Kimchi with GI and analyzed the impact on the trade balance. Approximately 42.8% of 500 Japanese consumers answered that they would purchase Korean Kimchi with GI and they were willing to pay 7.8% more than the present price. Approximately 78.7% of 300 Taiwanese consumers replied that they purchase it and would pay 25.1% more. In addition, Japanese and Taiwanese consumers reported that they expected to increase their Korean Kimchi purchases by 21.9% and 22.4%, respectively. Based on the survey results, the effects of the trade balance were measured using the methodology of a preliminary impact assessment using the KREI-KASMO model.

In this study, the characteristics are noted in two aspects: ‘fluidity’ and ‘virtuality.’ These two properties determine the position and role of it in new media art, while also distinguishing it from traditional art. The term frozen happening is a name given by Van der Marck to George Segal’s works in that it evokes specific events through crowded figures. Segal mainly uses the ‘life-casting’ technique of making moulds from the body of living models. This approach has a formal similarity to the Tableaux Vivant, in which dressed-up people acted with silent and immobile certain scenes in painting or theater, myths or historical events in a short time. Based on this context, this paper confirms the aesthetic meaning of frozen happening in new media art, and uses Joanna Barck’s study of Tableaux Vivant as a theoretical analysis framework. And this paper illustrates this through digital cinema, computer-based interactive art, and generative art using artificial evolution algorithm. In the first case, frozen happening appears as a ‘fluid’ characterized by translucent transitions, and in the second, it functions as a gateway to encountering events hidden by ‘virtuality.’ Finally, the case of generative art, which presents sculpture and projection together, metaphorically suggests the meaning of living and its freezing through the paradox of ‘living without movement.’"

손 위치 및 외부 부하에 따른 전신 불편도 예측,2019,"['Hand position', 'External load', 'Whole body discomfort', 'External load classification scheme']",,"Objective: The purpose of this study is to develop linear models for predicting whole body discomfort and a new external load classification scheme depending upon hand position and external load.  Background: Although quantification of whole body discomfort is useful for assessing physical workload, study on whole body discomfort is seldom found. The classification schemes of external load adopted in the existing posture classification methods such as OWAS, RULA, REBA etc. reflect just quantity of external load without considering their locations in the real work postures, which results in inaccurate work stress.  Method: An experiment for measuring whole body discomfort was conducted, in which hand position and external load were used as independent variables. The hand position was determined by using percentages of shoulder height and arm distance. Fifteen healthy male college students without histories of musculoskeletal disorders participated in the experiment, whose demographic data are as follows: Age - 21.3 ± 1.80 years; Stature - 175.3 ± 5.88cm; Body weight - 75.5 ± 12.31kg.  Results: ANOVA revealed that hand position, i.e. hand vertical height and horizontal distance, external load and their interaction effects are statistically significant on the whole body discomfort at α = 0.1 or 0.01. The effect of external load is the highest, followed by hand horizontal distance, and vertical height. Based on the experimental results, three types of linear models predicting whole body discomfort were proposed, which was classified by independent variables used in the models: hand position and external; angles of joint motions measured for experimental postures; and ROM transformed ratios for angles of joint motions. A new classification scheme of external load reflecting quantity of external load as well as its position was also developed.  Conclusion: The study developed three linear modes for predicting whole body discomfort and a new classification scheme of external load.  Application: The results of this study are useful for predicting whole body discomfort depending on hand position and external load, and for more precisely assessing work load according to external load."
3D Depth Computation of Moving Objects Using a CNN with an Orthogonal Stereo Fisheye Camera System,2019,"['Fisheye camera', 'Depth computation', 'Orthogonal stereo matching', 'Viewpoint transformation', 'Wide angle']",,"Stereo matching of images taken by wide-angle (WA) fisheye lens cameras pose difficulties because the degree of distortion increases along the outer edge of the image. In addition, in an orthogonal stereo camera system in which adjacent WA cameras are positioned at right angles to cover 360°, the relationship between correspondence and depth information varies from that of a general-purpose parallel stereo camera system, thus requiring special mathematical modeling. In order to solve the abovementioned problems, this paper proposes an algorithm to minimize the degree of distortion by viewpoint transformation, and calculates the three-dimensional distance information of a moving object through the mathematical modeling of a fisheye stereo camera system arranged at right angles. The proposed algorithm consists of five steps. First, using the calibrated camera parameters, the viewpoints are changed so that the stereo images perpendicular to each other are viewed in parallel in the same direction. Second, by using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, features are extracted from the viewpoint-transformed images. Third, matching between adjacent images based on the extracted features is performed. Fourth, depth information of moving objects is calculated from matching points. Finally, the computed depth information is refined for improved accuracy. Simulation results show that the depth calculated by the proposed algorithm is fairly accurate, with an average error rate of about 4%."
Research on a fault diagnosis method of rolling bearings using variation mode decomposition and deep belief network,2019,"['Rolling bearings', 'Fault diagnosis', 'Deep belief network', 'Variation mode decomposition', 'Hilbert transform', 'Variable working condition']",,"The working conditions of rolling bearings during the running change in real time. Aiming at the problem of fault diagnosis of rolling bearing under complex working conditions, a new fault diagnosis (VHDBN) method based on variation mode decomposition (VMD), Hilbert transform (HT) and deep belief network (DBN) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the proposed fault diagnosis method performs the VMD decomposition for the time domain signal in order to obtain a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), and Hilbert envelope spectrum is obtained by Hilbert transform. The Hilbert envelope spectrum is used to construct the feature matrix, which is used as an input of the DBN network in order to obtain a fault diagnosis model. In order to test and verify the effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis method, the experimental data of rolling bearings under variable load is used in here. The experimental results show that the VMD-Hilbert envelope spectrum can better reflect the fault characteristics than the time domain spectrum, and the proposed fault diagnosis method under variable load has higher recognition accuracy than other comparison methods."

By understanding key characteristics of minjian, we can understand the dynamic relationship between state apparatuses and minjian. According to the general explanation, China’s postsocialist changes began in the mid-1980s with the central party-state’s leadership symbolized by Deng Xiaoping. Similarly, North Korea’s postsocialist transformation is also believed to advance under the supreme leader Kim Jong-un’s leadership. I critically evaluate the effectiveness of the analytical framework that focuses on the central government’s political decision and leadership in explaining postsocialist transformations. Specifically, this study analyzes grassroots changes in minjian such as unofficial domestic and overseas trades and ordinary people’s growing participation in various non-socialist activities, which appeared before the official initiation of postsocialist policies. Following this research’s model of “minjian prior to the government,” not the party-state but minjian first formed non-socialist practices. Only after the practices had generated certain positive outcomes, the party-state recognized the minjian practices and started the official version of postsocialist reform."

Disturbance Observer Based Robust Sliding Mode Control of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor,2019,['Disturbance observer · PMSM · Lyapunov · Robust · SMC'],,"This paper addresses speed control of permanent magnet synchronous motor under load torque perturbations. The mathematical model is derived using park’s transformation. The load torque disturbance is considered unknown bounded, and states variables are available in feedback. In order to achieve robust speed performance, sliding mode control (SMC) is introduced.However, it is noted that conventional SMC does not provide satisfactory performance under load torque disturbances. To end this, a novel control strategy called disturbance observer SMC (DOSMC) is formulated. It includes an observer that ofers a tool to vanish the efect of load torque. The DOSMC technique has two distinguished characteristics: frst, the design gains are needed to be greater than the maximum limit of disturbance estimation error instead of disturbances, second; the proposed observer estimates load disturbances and provide a compensator to update sliding surface and control input. The stability analysis of overall control system is verifed using Lyapunov theorem. Simulations in MATLAB/Simulink proves efcacy of the proposed scheme."

The CoFN-Alg composite was used as adsorbent to remove Congo red (CR), brilliant green (BG), and methylene blue (MB) dyes from single and ternary dye systems. The adsorption of different dyes on CoFNAlg composite was studied at varying parameters such as contact time, varying pH, adsorbent dose, and initial concentration at different temperatures through batch mode. Results of kinetic studies revealed that the adsorption data of different dyes in single system as well as ternary system was best fitted in Lagergren pseudo second order model. Similarly, the adsorption equilibrium data was well correlated by Langmuir isotherm model in both types of dye systems. In single system, the maximum adsorption capacities of CR, BG, and MB dyes for CoFN-Alg composite were 93.0, 92.1, 95.8 mg/g and for ternary system were 60.0, 64.4, and 76.9 mg/g, respectively. The calculated adsorption thermodynamic parameters confirmed that adsorption process was spontaneous in nature. The results of regeneration studies concluded that CoFN-Alg composite retained around 78 % regeneration efficiency even after five successive cycles in single as well as ternary system.

Groome's intention is not that all of us as Christian religious educators need to use his shared praxis approach to CRE; rather, he stresses that we should be aware of and consciously attend to the six great questions in CRE. These questions should be answered by each generation. Groome proposes a CRE toward education for the Kingdom of God by wresting with viewpoints of a wide variety of theologians and religious educators ㅡ from those of ancient Greek thinkers to the more recent Jean Piaget. In what follows, I will first attempt to explain the main features of Groome's CRE with reference to the six major questions, which represent the nature of, the purpose of, the context of, an approach to, the readiness for, and the copartners in CRE. Second, I will explore his approach to CRE and/or to educating for Christians and Christian community from a practical theological perspective. Third, I will offer the contributions of his model of CRE, which challenges us to rethink and strengthen Christian education or the educational ministry, along with critical review. Finally, I will conclude by stating what Groome's CRE means to us in our time."

For this purpose, a new coupled size-dependent model is developed for a plate-shape nano-resonator made of nonlinear viscoelastic material based on modified coupled stress theory. The virtual work induced by viscous forces obtained in the framework of the Leaderman integral for the size-independent and size-dependent stress tensors. With incorporating the size-dependent potential energy, kinetic energy, and an external excitation force work based on Hamilton’s principle, the viscous work equation is balanced. The resulting size-dependent viscoelastically coupled equations are solved using the expansion theory, Galerkin method and the fourth-order Runge–Kutta technique. The Hilbert–Huang transform is performed to examine the effects of the viscoelastic parameter and initial excitation values on the nanosystem free vibration. Furthermore, the secondary resonance due to the super-harmonic motions are examined in the form of frequency response, force response, Poincare map, phase portrait and fast Fourier transforms. The results show that the vibration of viscoelastic nanosystem is non-stationary at higher excitation values unlike the elastic ones. In addition, ignoring the small-size effects shifts the secondary resonance, significantly."

Groome's intention is not that all of us as Christian religious educators need to use his shared praxis approach to CRE; rather, he stresses that we should be aware of and consciously attend to the six great questions in CRE. These questions should be answered by each generation. Groome proposes a CRE toward education for the Kingdom of God by wresting with viewpoints of a wide variety of theologians and religious educators ㅡ from those of ancient Greek thinkers to the more recent Jean Piaget. In what follows, I will first attempt to explain the main features of Groome's CRE with reference to the six major questions, which represent the nature of, the purpose of, the context of, an approach to, the readiness for, and the copartners in CRE. Second, I will explore his approach to CRE and/or to educating for Christians and Christian community from a practical theological perspective. Third, I will offer the contributions of his model of CRE, which challenges us to rethink and strengthen Christian education or the educational ministry, along with critical review. Finally, I will conclude by stating what Groome's CRE means to us in our time."
Persistent Erectile Dysfunction after Discontinuation of 5-Alpha Reductase Inhibitor Therapy in Rats Depending on the Duration of Treatment,2019,"['5-alpha reductase inhibitors', 'Dutasteride', 'Erectile dysfunction', 'Finasteride']",,"Purpose: The current study is aimed to assess whether a longer duration of 5α-reductase inhibitor (5α-RI) exposure was asso-ciated with higher rate of permanent erectile dysfunction (ED) in a rat model.Materials and Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=76) were assigned to five groups: (i) normal control group; (ii) dutaste-ride (0.5 mg/rat/d) for 4-weeks group; (iii) dutasteride for 4-weeks plus 2-weeks of resting group; (iv) dutasteride for 8-weeks group; and (v) dutasteride for 8-weeks plus 2-weeks of resting group. In vivo erectile responses to electrical stimulation, and changes of fibrotic factors and smooth muscle/collagen contents in the corpus cavernosum were evaluated in each group.Results: Dutasteride administration for 4 and 8 weeks significantly decreased erectile parameters compared with the control group. Reduced erectile responses were recovered during 2 weeks of drug-free time in the 4-week treatment group, but were not in the 8-week group. Protein levels of fibrosis-related factors transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, TGF-β2, and p-Smad/Smad (Smad 2/3) in the corpus cavernosum showed no significant change after 4 weeks of dutasteride oral administration, but were enhanced after 8 weeks. Dutasteride markedly decreased smooth muscle content and increased collagen after 4 and 8 weeks of use, but no nuclear size changes; however, neither group showed significant improvement in the smooth muscle to collagen ratio after the rest period.Conclusions: Our study showed that recovery from ED depended on the duration of medication, and administration of dutas-teride for more than 8-weeks in rats could result in irreversible ED even after discontinuation of medication."

Mechanism and force-energy parameters of a hollow shaft’s multi-wedge synchrostep cross-wedge rolling,2019,"['Hollow shafts', 'MSCWR', 'Stress and strain', 'Force energy parameters']",,"First, the rotation condition of a hollow shaft’s multi-wedge synchrostep cross-wedge rolling (MSCWR) is determined and the relevant influencing rule is illustrated based on a mechanical model of the hollow shaft and the theory of solid shaft’s rotation condition. The influence rule states that the increasing number of wedges increases the shrinkage rate of the hollow shaft and diminishes the rotation conditions, which can be improved by increasing μ on the forming surface of the hollow rolling mold, setting the stretching b , and forming α angles at approximately 4°-12° and 15°-35°, respectively. Second, a rigid-plastic finite element model is established for the hollow shaft with MSCWR by using the DEFORM-3D software, and the deformation mechanism of the hollow shaft is illustrated. The deformation degree of the rolling piece at the stretching stage decreases gradually from the surface to the interior of the hollow shaft, and radial compressive and transverse tensile strains interact with each other, thus resulting in an elliptic cross section of the hollow shaft.Stress field is mainly distributed in the exterior margin and then permeates into the inner part along the direction of the wall thickness, gradually transforming from compressive stress into tensile stress. Third, the influence of mechanical parameters on hollow shaft rolling is analyzed. The increased stretching angle increases the radial force, transverse force, and rolling torque and decreases the axial force.Moreover, the enlarged forming angle reduces the radial and transverse forces, while the decreased rolling torque increases the axial force. Finally, the 1:5 MSCWR experiment on the hollow shaft verifies the proposed finite element model’s accuracy. Results of the research provide a theoretical basis for the MSCWR of a precise hollow shaft."
Reliability analysis of acyclic transmission network based on minimal cuts using copula in repair,2019,"['Network reliability', 'Acyclic transmission network', 'Mean time to failure', 'Sensitivity', 'Supplementary variable techniques', 'Gumbel-Hougaard family of copula']",,"In the present paper, we have considered acyclic transmission network in which number of nodes are capable of receiving or sending a signal to the target nodes. To model the proposed acyclic transmission network, the present study combined the concepts of Markov process and minimal cuts incorporating copula to find the various reliability measures. The considered network can have four possible states namely operable, partial failure, critical failure and complete failure. The considered network can be repaired in two different ways. When the network is in critical state it is repaired with general repair whereas in complete failure state repaired with the help of two different repair rates namely general and exponential which has been incorporated with the application of Gumbel-Hougaard family of copula. Various reliability characteristics such as transition state probabilities, asymptotic behavior, reliability, mean time to failure and sensitivity of the proposed network have been evaluated with the help of minimal cuts coupling with Markov process using Gumbel-Hougaard copula, supplementary variable technique and Laplace transforms."
무의식적 관점에서 본 세잔 1,2019,['Cezanne · The unconscious · Art · Ego function'],,"Cezanne is the father of modern art. His place in the history of art is solid and contemporary art is also oriented in the direction of the art he has transformed. This article is the first integrated paper to attempt to explain Cezanne from an unconscious point of view and a basic study informing the beginning of the paper to be carried forward. I briefly describe Cezanne’s life, the change of his style of art, important concepts that Cezanne thinks of such as nature, sensation, color and how he works. On the basis of this, I reveal how that the art form of Cezanne changed through his relationship with Pissarro was related to the function of the ego, and the incompatible task Cezanne sought to pursue ‘eternal life in a changing landscape’ and ‘expressing living life within a solid structure’ can be explained as a structural model of the unconscious. This study forms a significant basis for explaining my papers on Cezanne in the future. The study of Cezanne will hold a meaningful position in the art history from the unconscious perspective."

Oral delivery of insulin via mesoporous carbon nanoparticles for colonic release allows glycemic control in diabetic rats,2019,['Insulin · Mesoporous carbon · Nanoparticles · Diabetes mellitus · Oral administration'],,"In this article, a new type of mesoporous carbon nanoparticles (MCN) was fabricated as a potential oral delivery system of insulin to reduce the adverse reactions by hypodermic injection. The mesoporous carbon nanoparticles-carried insulin (MCNI) was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) compared with the blank MCNs. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was utilized to calculate the specific surface area. The pore volume and pore size distribution (PSD) curves were calculated by Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model. The entrapment efficiency (EE%) and loading content (LC%) of insulin onto the MCNs were determined by RP-HPLC. In vitro insulin release from MCNI was determined in simulated intestinal fluid. To evaluate the pharmacodynamics of MCNIs orally, the variation of glycemia of diabetic rats after oral administration of MCNIs was compared with the rats receiving hypodermic injection of insulin. Besides, the absorption of FITC-labeled MCNs in HCT-116 cells was tested. The results showed that there is significant difference between MCNs and MCNIs through SEM, TEM, and FT-IR. The entrapment efficiency, loading content and in vitro insulin release met the requirements of the pharmacodynamic study. The specific surface area, pore volume and pore size of MCNIs were significantly decreased compared to that of MCNs. The pharmacodynamics study showed that the blood sugar level was significantly decreased after the oral administration of MCNIs. The FITC-labeled MCNs showed significant absorption in HCT-116 cells. The MCNIs were successfully synthesized with commendable entrapment efficiency and loading content which preferably decreased the blood sugar in diabetes rats via oral administration."

Causality between climatic and soil factors on Italian ryegrass yield in paddy field via climate and soil big data,2019,"['Causality', 'Climate big data', 'Italian ryegrass', 'Soil physical properties', 'Paddy field']",,"This study aimed to identify the causality between climatic and soil variables affecting the yield of Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam., IRG) in the paddy field by constructing the pathways via structure equation model. The IRG data (n = 133) was collected from the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (1992-2013). The climatic variables were accumulated temperature, growing days and precipitation amount from the weather information system of Korea Meteorological Administration, and soil variables were effective soil depth, slope, gravel content and drainage class as soil physical properties from the soil information system of Rural Development Administration. In general, IRG cultivation by the rice-rotation system in paddy field is important and unique in East Asia because it contributes to the increase of income by cultivating IRG during agricultural off-season. As a result, the seasonal effects of accumulated temperature and growing days of autumn and next spring were evident, furthermore, autumnal temperature and spring precipitation indirectly influenced yield through spring temperature. The effect of autumnal temperature, spring temperature, spring precipitation and soil physics factors were 0.62, 0.36, 0.23, and 0.16 in order (p < 0.05). Even though the relationship between soil physical and precipitation was not significant, it does not mean there was no association. Because the soil physical variables were categorical, their effects were weakly reflected even with scale adjustment by jitter transformation. We expected that this study could contribute to increasing IRG yield by presenting the causality of climatic and soil factors and could be extended to various factors."
Facile and simple synthesis of triethylenetetramine-modified mesoporous silica adsorbent for removal of Cd(II),2019,"['Mesoporous', 'Silica Microspheres', 'Amine Functionalized', 'Adsorption', 'Cd(II) Removal']",,"Monodispersed porous silica microspheres (SM) were synthesized and further functionalized with amine moieties using triethylenetetramine (TETA) in order to obtain a novel adsorbent for Cd(II) elimination from aqueous media. The morphology, texture and structure of samples were characterized with the aid of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-Ray diffraction (XRD), scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM, TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and N2 adsorption-desorption. The adsorption efficiency was investigated based on the effect of operational parameters including pH of the solution, the dose of adsorbent, adsorption time, initial concentration of Cd(II) ions and temperature. The equilibrium, kinetics and thermodynamics of Cd(II) adsorption were also studied. The maximum adsorption capacity of amine functionalized silica microspheres (AMSM) for Cd(II) was 35.6mg g1. Cd(II) adsorption onto AMSM had highest consistency with Sips and Langmuir isotherms, while adsorption kinetics was best fitted with pseudo-second order model. Thermodynamics of adsorption revealed that Cd(II) adsorption on AMSM was spontaneous, feasible and exothermic with physical interactions and pore diffusion being the dominant mechanisms in the adsorption process. Results confirmed that AMSM adsorbent has the potential to be a suitable candidate for Cd(II) removal from aqueous solutions"

We collected data on 27 public enterprises from 2008 to 2017. To counteract the violation of traditional DEA assumptions due to negative outputs, we use both positively transformed variant return to scale (VRS) and semi-oriented radial measure (SORM) models. At the same time, we test the reliability of the models by focusing on the relevancy of benchmarking decision making units (DMUs) rather than simply using the correlation of efficiency between models.Contrast to the skeptical view, our findings suggest that the overall efficiency of public enterprises has been improved over years. However, the trend of efficiency is heterogeneous even within the same industry. For instance, some public enterprises such as Incheon Port Authority shows the downward trend and power companies show different trends. Hence, while the overall efficiency trend of public enterprises is upward, the performance management of public enterprises should reflect the specific status of their efficiency trend."
tPA Helpers in the Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke: Are They Ready for Clinical Use?,2019,"['Tissue plasminogen activator', 'Stroke', 'Thrombolysis', 'Adjuvant therapy', 'Neuroprotection']",,"Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the only therapeutic agent approved to treat patients with acute ischemic stroke. The clinical benefits of tPA manifest when the agent is administered within 4.5 hours of stroke onset. However, tPA administration, especially delayed administration, is associated with increased intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), hemorrhagic transformation (HT), and mortality. In the ischemic brain, vascular remodeling factors are upregulated and microvascular structures are destabilized. These factors disrupt the blood brain barrier (BBB). Delayed recanalization of the vessels in the presence of relatively matured infarction appears to damage the BBB, resulting in HT or ICH, also known as reperfusion injury. Moreover, tPA itself activates matrix metalloproteases, further aggravating BBB disruption. Therefore, attenuation of edema, HT, or ICH after tPA treatment is an important therapeutic strategy that may enable clinicians to extend therapeutic time and increase the probability of excellent outcomes. Recently, numerous agents with various mechanisms have been developed to interfere with various steps of ischemia/ reperfusion injuries or BBB destabilization. These agents successfully reduce infarct volume and decrease the incidence of ICH and HT after delayed tPA treatment in various animal stroke models.However, only some have entered into clinical trials; the results have been intriguing yet unsatisfactory. In this narrative review, I describe such drugs and discuss the problems and future directions. These “tPA helpers” may be clinically used in the future to increase the efficacy of tPA in patients with acute ischemic stroke."
Comparison of XCH4 Derived from g-b FTS and GOSAT and Evaluation Using Aircraft In-Situ Observations over TCCON Site,2019,['Aircraft in-situ . G-b FTS . GOSAT . XCH4'],,"It is evident that evaluating the measurement of greenhouse gases (GHGs) obtained from multi-platform instruments against accurate and precise instrument such as aircraft in-situ is very essential when using remote sensing GHGs results for source/sink estimations with inverse modeling. The results of the inverse models are very sensitive even to small biases in the data (Rayner and O’Brien 2001). In this work, we have evaluated ground-based high resolution Fourier Transform Spectrometer (g-b FTS) and the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) column-averaged dry air mole fraction of methane (XCH4) through aircraft in-situ observations over Anmyeondo station (36.538o N, 126.331o E, 30 m above sea level). The impact of the spatial coincidence criteria was assessed by comparing GOSAT data against g-b FTS.We noticed there was no any systematic difference based on the given coincidence criteria. GOSATexhibited a bias ranging from 0.10 to 3.37 ppb, with the standard deviation from 4.92 to 12.54 ppb, against g-b FTS with the spatial coincidence criteria of ±1, ±3, ±5 degrees of latitude and longitude and ± 1 h time window. Data observed during ascent and descent of the aircraft is considered as vertical profiles within an altitude range of 0.2 to a maximum of 9.0 km so that some assumptions were applied for the construction of the profiles below 0.2 and above 9.0 km. In addition, the suitability of aircraft data for evaluation of remote sensing instruments was confirmed based on the assessment of uncertainties. The spatial coincidence criteria is ±1o latitude and ± 2o longitude and for temporal difference is ±1 h of the satellite observation overpass time were applied, whereas g-b FTS data are the mean values measured within ±30 min of the aircraft observation time. Furthermore, the sensitivity differences of the instruments were taken into account.With respect to aircraft, the g-b FTS data were biased by −0.19 ± 0.69%, while GOSAT data were biased by −0.42 ± 0.84%. These results confirm that both g-b FTS and GOSAT are consistent aircraft observations and assure the reliability of the datasets for inverse estimate of CH4."

Investigation on the Preparation and Adsorption Performance of Bamboo Fiber Based Activated Carbon,2019,"['Bamboo fiber', 'Activated carbon', 'Taguchi method', 'MB adsorption', 'Structural properties']",,"In this work, an approach was explored to make natural fiber based activated carbon with high adsorption capacity for treating dyeing wastewater. Bamboo fiber based activated carbon (BFAC) was prepared by bamboo fiber extracted from bamboo strips by extracting technique. An orthogonal experiment was carried out to obtain optimum preparation condition for the best dye adsorption. The microstructures of BFAC were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, N2 adsorption-desorption analysis, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Adsorption mechanism of BFAC to methylene blue (MB) was studied and the adsorption isotherm followed the Langmuir model, with maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 651.7 mg g-1. The adsorption kinetic was better described by the pseudo-second-order model. Microstructure characterization showed lots of opened pores and cracks with different size on BFAC, with Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 1370 m2 g-1 and total pore volume of 0.9411 cm3 g-1. The analysis indicated that cellulose crystal of bamboo fiber was severely destroyed in the preparation process, which could contribute to the formation of pores. Moreover, -OH and -C=O functional groups on BFAC are beneficial for adsorbing MB in aqueous solution. As a result, adopting bamboo fiber may help form BFAC with high BET surface area, which proved to be an effective idea to prepare activated carbon with high adsorption performance."
중국‘당국가체제’의 역사적 맥락과 함의,2019,"['당국가체제', '중국', '국민당', '공산당', '개인 권위', '당조직 개편', 'Party-state system', 'China', 'the Kuomintang(Chinese Nationalist Party)', 'the CCP(Chinese Communist Party)', 'Personal authority', 'Reconstruction of party organization']","중국에서 ‘당국가체제’라는 개념은 다양한 영역에서 다중적인 의미로 사용된다. 현대중국의 ‘당국가체제’는 중국국민당이 통치하던 민국시기에 배태된 역사적 경험의 소산이다. ‘당국가체제’는 소련에서 기원했다. 1917년 레닌이 볼셰비키 혁명을 성공시킨 후 소련공산당이 ‘당국가체제’를 착근시켰다. 청말민초(淸末民初) 중국은 공화정이라는 새로운 국가건설의 길을 모색하고 있었다. 러시아의 경험은 당시 중국에게 당의 국가건설에서의 역할에 대한 논리적 정당성을 제공했다.중국에서 ‘당국가체제’의 출현은 손중산(孫中山)과 관련 있다. 손중산은 소련공산당 모델을 차용하여 중국국민당을 개조했다. 국민정부(國民政府)건설, ‘민주집권제 (民主集權制)’ 실행, ‘당이 정부를 대신하는(以黨代政)’ 정치체제, ‘건국대강(建國大綱)’에 기초한 군정시기(軍政時期), 훈정시기(訓政時期), 헌정시기(憲政時期) 등 세 단계 국가건설 등이 여기에 해당한다. 당이 국가건설을 주도한다는 손중산의 생각이 민국 초기 ‘당국가체제’를 형성하는데 사상적, 이론적 기초가 되었다.손중산은 중화혁명당을 설립했다. 정당의 성격에 수직관리, 신분(아이덴터티) 강조, 개인복종 등이 강화되었다. ‘총체적 성격을 갖는 혁명당’으로서 당치(黨治)를 강화하기 위한 일련의 조치가 초기 중국의 ‘당국가체제’의 성격을 규정했다. 이후 국민당으로 개명하고 혁명성을 더욱 강화하기 위해서 당조직 개편, 총리 영도권의 강화를 실행했다.당시 손중산은 혁명당은 혁명 방식을 통해서 민국(民國)을 건립하고, 이후에는 집권당의 방식으로 민국을 건설할 것을 강조했다. 손중산은 초기 국가건설 경험을 통해서 혁명당이 집권당으로 변화하는 논리를 제공했다. ‘당국가체제’의 핵심이 바로 집권당의 혁명적 역할이라는 점을 강조했다.손중산의 국민당 개조는 ‘당국가체제’로 당을 탈바꿈시켜 나가는 것을 의미한다. 우선 조직개편을 추진했다. 기존 삼부제(총무, 당무, 재정) 외에 선전부와 교제부(交際部)를 증설했다. 아울러 법제, 정치, 군사, 농공, 부녀 등 문제를 다룰 5개 위원회를 설치하고별도로 중앙간부회의를 설립했다. 그리고 총리에게 사실상 당 인사에 대한 최고 임면권과 결정권을 부여했다. 개인 권위 강화는 1922년 하반기 국민당 개조, 국공합작, 러시아와 연대(連帶)로 구체화되었다. 결국 ‘당국가체제’ 초기 당에 의한 국가건설(以黨建國), 당에 의한 통치(以黨治國), 일당독재(一黨專制) 등의 내용이 이 시기에 형성되었다.청말민초 시기 중국 국민당의 ‘당국가체제’ 경험은 사회주의 중국으로 이어져 최고 지도자 개인 권위 강화, 당의 속성 변화 등으로 나타났다. 특히 시진핑 집권 이후 개인 권위 강화와 중앙 권위 강화로 이어졌다. 이 역시 당국가체제의 역사적 유산이다. 국가건설 과정 에서 당의 역할 강화는 당과 당원, 당과 인민의 거리를 좁혀야 하는 과제도 함께 전승 되었다. 또한 당조직이 최고지도자의 개인 권위를 강화하는데 복무했던 ‘당국가체제’의 역사적 유산과도 단절해야 하는 과제로 이어졌다.국가건설 초기 당은 자산계급 부활을 저지하고 제압하는 유용한 도구로 작동했다. 그러나 당의 성격이 변하면서 당국가체제의 역사적 유산은 당과 지도자의 권위 강화로만 남아있다. 이를 중국은 대중정당을 통해서 극복하려고 했었다. 그러나 계급은 신분화 되어가고 있다. 국가권력은 관료화 되어가고 있다. 당의 권력은 오히려 강화되고 있다.","In contemporary China, the concept of the party-state system is used in multiple meanings in various areas. The current party-state system is the product of historical experience adopted by the Kuomintang, a nationalist party, during the period of the Republic of China. The official party-state system originated in the former Soviet Union. After Lenin succeeded in the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union formed the party-state system. China was seeking a new way to build a country in terms of the Republican political system during the end of the Qing and the beginning of the Republic of China. Russia’s experience at the time provided China with logical justification for the role of the party in the course of state formation.The emergence of the party-state system in China is deeply associated with Sun Yatsen. He reorganized the Kuomintang of the Republic of China by borrowing the Soviet Communist Party model. These include the construction of a national government, the implementation of a ‘democratic centralized system,’ a political system in which the party replaces the government, and the construction of a nation by three stages such as military rule, political tutelage, constitutional government, which are based on the ‘Fundamentals of National Reconstruction’ by Sun Yatsen. His idea that the party plays a leading role in the construction of the nation has become the ideological and theoretical foundation for formulating the early party-state system.Sun Yatsen founded the Chinese Revolutionary Party. Hierarchical administration, emphasis on social status identity and personal obedience were strengthened in the nature of political party. As a ‘revolutionary party with comprehensive characteristics’, a series of measures aimed at strengthening the party’s leadership created the prototype of the early party-state system in China. Since then, the party has renamed itself as the Kuomintang and implemented a reorganization of the party and the strengthening of the prime minister’s leadership in order to further strengthen its revolutionary spirit. At that time, Sun Yatsen stressed that the Revolutionary Party should build a nation through the revolutionary method, and later a nation should be built in the way of the ruling party. He provided the logic of the revolutionary party’s transformation into a ruling party through his early experience of national construction. He stressed that the core of the party-state system is the revolutionary role of the ruling party.Sun Yatsen’s reform of the Kuomintang means transforming the party into the party-state system. He pushed ahead with the reorganization of the party. In addition to the existing tripartite system (general affairs, party affairs, and finance), it has expanded the Ministry of Propaganda and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. As well, it set up five committees to deal with issues such as legislation, politics, military, agriculture and industry and women, and established a separate central executive meeting. And it gave the prime minister virtually the highest right to appoint and decide party members. The strengthening of personal authority was embodied in the second half of 1922 through the renovation of the Kuomintang, the United Front with theCCP and solidarity with Russia. In the early days, after all, the construction of the state by the party, the ruling by the party, and the one-party dictatorship are the core characteristics of China’s party-state system.The experience of the Kuomintang-centered party-state system during the late Qing and the early Republic of China was succeeded to socialist China, strengthening the personal authority of the supreme leader and changing the party's character. Since Xi Jinping took power, in particular, strengthening his personal authority and central authority were important. This is also a historical legacy of the party-state system. The strengthening of the role of the leading party in the process of state formation has also resulted in the task of narrowing the distance between the party and its members as well as the people. It also faces the task of severing itself from the historical legacy of the party-state system, which served to strengthen the personal authority of its supreme leader.In the beginning period of state formation, the party worked as a useful tool to deter and subdue the revival of the ruling class. As the party’s character changes, however, the historical legacy of the party-state system remains only the strengthening of the authority of the party and its leader. China was trying to overcome this through making the CCP the party for the mass. But the deepening social division is being more identified, state power more bureaucratic and the power of the party rather strengthened."

The use of MBSE transform system description into diagrams which clearly describe the logical interaction between functions hence minimizes the risk of ambiguity. A theoretical and Finite Element Methodology (FEM) was used to assess and compare the residual stresses in the tube-to-tubesheet contact area. Additionally, the axial strength of the tube to tubesheet joint based on the pull-out force against the contact joint force was evaluated and recommended optimum autofrettage pressure to minimize residual stresses in the transition zone given. A single U-tube hole and tubesheet with ligament thickness was taken as a single cylinder and plane strain condition was assumed. An iterative method was used in FEM simulation to find the limit autofrettage pressure at which pull-out force and contact force are of the same magnitude.The joint contact force was estimated to be 20 times more than the pull-out force and the limit autofrettage pressure was estimated to be 141.85MPa."

The European Union’s smart specialization strategy suggests that regional industrial policy should be designed and implemented in the direction of strengthening endogenous capacity-building and establishing sustainable and inclusive development model. Culture not only promotes industrial diversification through the combination of knowledge relying on a symbolic knowledge base, but also is increasingly important for improving the overall economy and building a base for sustainable growth. To foster regional innovative growth and structural change through smart specialization, culture and cultural policy can contribute to: the transformation into convergence ecosystem around cultural contents(path transition), the creation of innovative values based on culture and the expansion of creativity, culture and the arts(path modernization), the discovery of new areas and tasks based on cultural demand(path diversification), and development of human resource for job creation, entrepreneurship, regional resilience(value-based foundation)."

For this purpose, a mode analysis of the target pipeline is performed, and TMD installation locations are selected as important modes with relatively large mass participation ratio in each direction. In order to design the TMD at selected positions, each corresponding mode is replaced with a SDOF damped model, and accordingly the corresponding pipeline is converted into a 2-DOF system by considering the TMD as a SDOF damped model. Then, optimal design values of the TMD, which can minimize the dynamic amplification factor of the transformed 2-DOF system, are derived through GA optimization method. The proposed TMD design values are applied to the pipeline numerical model to analyze seismic performance with and without TMD installation. As a result of numerical analyses, it is confirmed that the directional acceleration responses, the maximum normal stresses and directional reaction forces of the pipeline system are reduced, quite a lot. The results of this study are expected to be used as basic information with respect to the improvement of the seismic performance of the piping system in the future."

This paper presentsthe flight and hover control system for a mini-quadrotor, including design and simulation of calculations and controllers.Firstly, the attitude and position of the mini-quadrotor are obtained by distributed multi-sensors. Since attitudecalculation of aircraft needs a number of combined rotations and vectors transformed by rotation, quaternionsare applied to express the attitude model. About error compensation of gyroscope and accelerometer, IMU_Updataalgorithm of Mahony filter are applied and improved to realize data fusion [1]. In order to realize accurate hoveringat certain position, UWB (UltraWideband) are applied to gain positional information of mini-quadrotor and correctthe antenna delay caused sensor error by base station positioning. The discrete Kalman filter of original data is usedto achieve the optimized estimation of the airborne position. Px4flow optical flow sensor is able to gets velocityinformation and avoid the noise problem, which is caused by differential of position data. Then, the mathematicalmodel of a mini-quadrotor’s flight and hover control system can be established. Herein, integral items are solved bythe integral separation and integral limiting to mitigate the serious overshoot and oscillation of the system caused bythe cascade PID. Finally, the simulation of the attitude controller and position controller are applied with the MATLABSimulink library.

The addition of the alloying elements usually increases the stacking fault energy, which is calculated using a modified thermodynamic model. Although the yield strength of austenitic high-manganese steels is increased by the addition of the alloying elements, the tensile strength is significantly affected by the deformation mechanism associated with stacking fault energy because of grain size refinement caused by deformation twinning and mobile dislocations generated during deformation-induced martensite transformation. None of the austenitic high-manganese steels exhibit clear ductile-brittle transition behavior, but their absorbed energy gradually decreases with lowering test temperature, regardless of the alloying elements. However, the combined addition of Mn and Al to the austenitic high-manganese steels suppresses the decrease in absorbed energy with a decreasing temperature by enhancing austenite stability."
Optimal number of control points for fitting B-splines in wind turbine blade measurement,2019,['Coherent laser radar 3D metrology B-spline fitting Data alignment Large-scale manufacture inspection'],,"The manufacture of large-scale products such as aircraft and wind turbines needs detailed inspection to ensure the required dimensional tolerances are met. A coherent laser radar with an assisting mirror was used in this research to inspect a half-size wind turbine blade. This paper investigates the optimal distribution of inspection points that would produce the most accurate B-Spline fitting to the CAD model surfaces and so shorten the inspection and analysis process without compromising on accuracy. Even though the optimal solution was found to be points with 100 mm spacing on a moderate surface gradient and with 20–25 mm spacing on a more severe surface gradient, the findings suggest the employment of a non-uniform distribution would produce a more accurate fitting. This paper also explores data alignment by Degree of Freedom constraints with a triple B-Spline and investigates whether denser data points would improve the transformation. The optimal solution was found to be constraining movement in Z, Rx and Ry. Therefore, to achieve better transformation, surfaces were treated based on their gradient. This resulted in a constraint in X, Y and Z, and Ry for a moderate gradient and Y, Z and Rz for a more severe gradient. The optimal number of inspection points for fitting a B-Spline on a half-size blade was found to be 18 points for the front section with 100 mm spacing, 15 points for the back section with 100 mm spacing, and between 14 and 18 points with 20–25 mm spacing on the base section."

X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), zeta potential analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) methods were used for characterization of adsorbents. Adsorption parameters for CV were investigated. Raw chitosan and Fe3O4 were also used for CV adsorption to compare the results of composites. The chosen adsorption parameters are amount of adsorbent, contact time, initial CV concentration, and temperature. The equilibrium period was observed to be very short for chitosan and Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The adsorption efficiencies of these adsorbents are very low. AC-Fe3O4 and AC-Fe3O4-Chitosan nanoparticles reached equilibrium at 80min. The all adsorbent-CV systems followed pseudo second-order kinetic model. AC-Fe3O4 and AC-Fe3O4-Chitosan composites suited non-linear Freundlich isotherm for all temperatures (298, 308 and 318 K). Regeneration of adsorbents was also investigated. 1M of acetic acid and 0.1M of NaOH solutions were tested. Acetic acid solution desorbed CV better than NaOH solution at 6 hours."

복합 문서의 의미적 분해를 통한 다중 벡터 문서 임베딩 방법론,2019,"['Document Embedding', 'Multi-Vector Document Embedding', 'Word Embedding', 'Text Mining', '문서 임베딩', '다중 벡터 문서 임베딩', '단어 임베딩', '텍스트 마이닝']","텍스트 데이터에 대한 다양한 분석을 위해 최근 비정형 텍스트 데이터를 구조화하는 방안에 대한 연구가 활발하게 이루어지고 있다. doc2Vec으로 대표되는 기존 문서 임베딩 방법은 문서가 포함한 모든 단어를 사용하여벡터를 만들기 때문에, 문서 벡터가 핵심 단어뿐 아니라 주변 단어의 영향도 함께 받는다는 한계가 있다. 또한기존 문서 임베딩 방법은 하나의 문서가 하나의 벡터로 표현되기 때문에, 다양한 주제를 복합적으로 갖는 복합문서를 정확하게 사상하기 어렵다는 한계를 갖는다. 본 논문에서는 기존의 문서 임베딩이 갖는 이러한 두 가지한계를 극복하기 위해 다중 벡터 문서 임베딩 방법론을 새롭게 제안한다. 구체적으로 제안 방법론은 전체 단어가 아닌 핵심 단어만 이용하여 문서를 벡터화하고, 문서가 포함하는 다양한 주제를 분해하여 하나의 문서를 여러 벡터의 집합으로 표현한다.

Text mining is generally conducted in two steps. In the first step, the text of the collected document is tokenized and structured to convert the original document into a computer-readable form. In the second step, tasks such as document classification, clustering, and topic modeling are conducted according to the purpose of analysis. Until recently, text mining-related studies have been focused on the application of the second steps, such as document classification, clustering, and topic modeling. However, with the discovery that the text structuring process substantially influences the quality of the analysis results, various embedding methods have actively been studied to improve the quality of analysis results by preserving the meaning of words and documents in the process of representing text data as vectors.Unlike structured data, which can be directly applied to a variety of operations and traditional analysis techniques, Unstructured text should be preceded by a structuring task that transforms the original document into a form that the computer can understand before analysis. It is called ""Embedding"" that arbitrary objects are mapped to a specific dimension space while maintaining algebraic properties for structuring the text data. Recently, attempts have been made to embed not only words but also sentences, paragraphs, and entire documents in various aspects. Particularly, with the demand for analysis of document embedding increases rapidly, many algorithms have been developed to support it. Among them, doc2Vec which extends word2Vec and embeds each document into one vector is most widely used.However, the traditional document embedding method represented by doc2Vec generates a vector for each document using the whole corpus included in the document. This causes a limit that the document vector is affected by not only core words but also miscellaneous words. Additionally, the traditional document embedding schemes usually map each document into a single corresponding vector. Therefore, it is difficult to represent a complex document with multiple subjects into a single vector accurately using the traditional approach. In this paper, we propose a new multi-vector document embedding method to overcome these limitations of the traditional document embedding methods.This study targets documents that explicitly separate body content and keywords. In the case of a document without keywords, this method can be applied after extract keywords through various analysis methods. However, since this is not the core subject of the proposed method, we introduce the process of applying the proposed method to documents that predefine keywords in the text.The proposed method consists of (1) Parsing, (2) Word Embedding, (3) Keyword Vector Extraction, (4) Keyword Clustering, and (5) Multiple-Vector Generation. The specific process is as follows. all text in a document is tokenized and each token is represented as a vector having N-dimensional real value through word embedding. After that, to overcome the limitations of the traditional document embedding method that is affected by not only the core word but also the miscellaneous words, vectors corresponding to the keywords of each document are extracted and make up sets of keyword vector for each document.Next, clustering is conducted on a set of keywords for each document to identify multiple subjects included in the document. Finally, a Multi-vector is generated from vectors of keywords constituting each cluster.The experiments for 3.147 academic papers revealed that the single vector-based traditional approach cannot properly map complex documents because of interference among subjects in each vector. With the proposed multi-vector based method, we ascertained that complex documents ..."
"Inhibition of Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase Enhances the Therapeutic Efficacy of Immunogenic Chemotherapeutics in Breast Cancer",2019,"['Breast neoplasms', 'Chemotherapy', 'Doxorubicin', 'Indoleamine 2', '3-dioxygenase']",,"Purpose: Breast cancer has become a major public health threat in the current society. Anthracycline doxorubicin (DOX) is a widely used drug in breast cancer chemotherapy. We aimed to investigate the immunogenic death of breast tumor cells caused by DOX, and detect the effects of combination of DOX and a small molecule inhibitor in tumor engrafted mouse model.Methods: We used 4T1 breast cancer cells to examine the anthracycline DOX-mediated immunogenic death of breast tumor cells by assessing the calreticulin exposure and adenosine triphosphate and high mobility group box 1 release. Using 4T1 tumor cell-engrafted mouse model, we also detected the expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in tumor tissues after DOX treatment and further explored whether the specific small molecule IDO1 inhibitor NLG919 combined with DOX, can exhibit better therapeutic effects on breast cancer.Results: DOX induced immunogenic cell death of murine breast cancer cells 4T1 as well as the upregulation of IDO1. We also found that treatment with NLG919 enhanced kynurenine inhibition in a dose-dependent manner. IDO1 inhibition reversed CD8+ T cell suppression mediated by IDO-expressing 4T1 murine breast cancer cells. Compared to the single agent or control, combination of DOX and NLG919 significantly inhibited the tumor growth, indicating that the 2 drugs exhibit synergistic effect. The combination therapy also increased the expression of transforming growth factor-β, while lowering the expressions of interleukin-12p70 and interferon-γ.Conclusion: Compared to single agent therapy, combination of NLG919 with DOX demonstrated better therapeutic effects in 4T1 murine breast tumor model. IDO inhibition by NLG919 enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of DOX in breast cancer, achieving synergistic effect."
Academic Medicine은 환자 중심 의료이다,2019,"['Academic medicine', 'Patient-centered care', 'Organizational values']",,"The tripartite mission of 'academic medicine' is education, research, and patient care. Academic medical centers (AMCs) are carrying out the mission and ultimately aiming to improve the health of people and communities. Globally, AMCs are facing a tremendous financial risk stemming from the changes in health insurance reimbursement plans and a shortage of human resources. Innovative AMCs in the United States are trying to transform their physician-centered, and siloed structure into a patient-centered, and integrated structure. They are also building integrated systems with primary healthcare groups to provide continuous patient care from primary to tertiary levels and making strategic networks based on value-based payment and the patient-centered model. These changes have been proven to improve outcomes of patient care and increase fiscal revenues, which are both crucial in supporting education and research. To address the shortage of human resources, programs are being built to develop newly appointed faculty for the future. AMCs have different approaches to bringing changes into their organizations; however, there is a common emphasis on 'a patient-centered approach,' which helps them set more explicit organizational values and make strategic decisions based on their values. Korean AMCs are facing similar challenges to AMCs in the United States in spite of many differences between the countries' healthcare systems. The innovative efforts of AMCs in the United States to address the challenges will be helpful, well-worked examples for Korean AMCs with similar challenges."
Leading for Safety: A Question of Leadership Focus,2019,"['Injury', 'Leadership', 'Safety compliance', 'Safety initiative', 'Workplace safety']",,"Background: There is considerable evidence that leadership influences workplace safety, but less is known about the relative importance of different leadership styles for safety. In addition, a leadership style characterized by an emphasis and a focus on promoting safety has rarely been investigated alongside other more general leadership styles.Methods: Data were collected through a survey to which 269 employees in a paper mill company responded. A regression analysis was conducted to examine the relative roles of transformational, transactional (management-by-exception active; MBEA), and safety-specific leadership for different safety behavioral outcomes (compliance behavior and safety initiative behaviors) and for minor and major injuries.Results: A safety-specific leadership contributed the most to the enhanced safety of the three different kinds of leadership. Transformational leadership did not contribute to any safety outcome over and above that of a safety-specific leadership, whereas a transactional leadership (MBEA) was associated with negative safety outcomes (fewer safety initiatives and increased minor injuries).Conclusion: The most important thing for leaders aiming at improving workplace safety is to continuously emphasize safety, both in their communication and by acting as role models. This highlights the importance for leadership training programs aiming to improve safety to actually focus on safety-promoting communication and behaviors rather than general leadership. Furthermore, an overly monitoring and controlling leadership style can be detrimental to attempts at achieving improved workplace safety."

Time Efficient Evaluation of Multi-axis MEMS Gyroscope Using Three-dimensional Test Methodology,2019,"['MEMS', '3-D test method', 'gyroscope evaluation']",,"Recently, the demand for micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) based inertial sensors has been increased due to a wide range of application in consumer electronics; however, high volume production remains a major challenge for the MEMS industry. This paper proposes a new three dimensional (3-D) test methodology for the time-efficient evaluation of multi-axis MEMS gyroscopes. A mathematical model for the proposed 3-D test method was derived based on the coordinates transformation. The 3-D test methodology was validated experimentally using three-axis MEMS gyroscope from ST Microelectronics and the results were compared with the conventional one dimensional (1-D) test method. The experimental results revealed that the measurement error between the conventional 1-D and the proposed 3-D test was less than 1%, whereas the test time was decreased three times. Finally, the error sources and limitations of the proposed 3-D test method was highlighted."
인산 및 수증기 활성화에 의한 대나무 활성탄 제조 및 특성 연구,2019,,,"Bamboo is an evergreen perennial plant, and it is known as one of the most productive and fastest-growing plants in the world. It grows quickly in moderate climates with only moderate water and fertilizer. Traditionally in Asia, bamboo is used for building materials, as a food source, and as versatile raw materials. Bamboo as a biomass feedstock can be transformed to prepare activated carbon using the thermal treatment of pyrolysis. The effect of process variables such as carbonization temperature, activation temperature, activation time, the amount of steam, and the mixing ratio of phosphoric acid and bamboo were systematically investigated to optimize the preparation conditions. Steam activation was proceeded after carbonization with a vapor flow rate of $0.8{\sim}1.8mL-H_2O\;g-char^{-1}\;h^{-1}$ and activation time of 1 ~ 3 h at $700{\sim}900^{\circ}C$. Carbon yield and surface area reached 2.04 ~ 20.59 wt% and $499.17{\sim}1074.04m^2\;g^{-1}$, respectively, with a steam flow rate of $1.4mL-H_2O\;g-char^{-1}\;h^{-1}$ for 2 h. Also, the carbon yield and surface area were 24.67 wt% and $1389.59m^2\;g^{-1}$, respectively, when the bamboo and phosphoric acid were mixed in a 1:1 weight ratio ($700^{\circ}C$, 2 h, $1.4mL-H_2O\;g-char^{-1}\;h^{-1}$). The adsorption of methylene blue into the bamboo activated carbon was studied based on pseudo first order and second order kinetics models. The adsorption kinetics were found to follow the pseudo second order model, which is governed by chemisorption."
배전계통에서의 PV 인버터 제어 특성을 고려한 고장해석 방법,2019,"['Fault analysis', 'Photovoltaic', 'Inverter control', 'PV fault current', '3phase power flow']",,"Photovoltaic(PV) generations in power distribution networks are dramatically increasing. As PV increases, there is a needs to consider the contribution of fault current. PV is connected to the grid through an inverter, and the control method has different current contributions from conventional generators. In this paper, we propose a fault analysis method considering the control characteristics of PV inverter for power distribution networks. The current and power of PV during a fault are determined by the terminal voltage and control methods of the inverter. To reflect the inverter control characteristics, 3 phase unbalanced power flow is used for the fault analysis. For this, we present the 3 phase models of distribution networks, such as line, transformer and PV. Admittance and impedance matrix representations were performed for the models. We use Implicit Zbus Method for the 3 phase unbalanced power flow. In the case studies for an example network, we compare the results between the proposed methods and MATLAB simulation. Through the case studies, we verify the accuracy of the proposed fault analysis method."

However, existing discussions on the relationship between Yeom Sang-seob and Rha Hye-seok show conflicting aspects. Some argue that the frustration of first love led to Yeom Sang-seob 's misogyny and that it led to a negative view of the new woman, and that Rha Hye-seok was the person that Yeom Sang-seob missed. In this paper analyzed the work and their writings and memoirs written by acquaintances, under the assumption that “Madam E” is a material that helps us understand their relationship.Based on the similarities with “mourning”, this paper reaffirmed the previous discussion that “Madam E” is a work modeled after Rha Hye-seok. And this paper confirmed that Rha Hye-seok, who visited Seoul in the 1920s, met Yeom Sang-seob, and that what Rha Hye-seok had arranged for Yeom Sang-seob to match was used as the subject of the novel.Next, this paper looked at the fictionalization of “Madam E”. When fictionalizing real persons or events, there is no other choice but to be transformed. It has been revealed that the author, unlike real facts, has fabricated his first love into a beautiful romance. Until the late 1920s, Rha Hye-seok was the person that Yeom Sang-seob missed, and this fact provides implications for understanding a new woman character in his works, which requires further study.On the other hand, it is important that “Madam E” is a work that Yeom Sang-seob wrote around the time of his success as a novelist, gaining stability in life and getting married. In “Madam E”, the thoughts of art and life that Yeom Sang-seob felt at that time, such as relief from becoming a famous writer and gaining composure in life, and self-absorbed feeling of lowering the standard of work for popular readers, are found. And “Madam E” can be interpreted as a work written by a writer ahead of the wedding while clearing his thoughts and feelings about first love. But Yeom Sang-seob has distanced himself from Rha Hye-seok since the 1930s of her divorce, which seems to have led to “Mourning”. As such, “Madam E” is meaningful as a material that allows one to look into the author's personal history behind him and his thoughts on art at the time, and help reconstruct the relationship between Yeom Sang-seob and Rha Hye-seok."
The state of framework development for implementing reasoning mechanisms in smart cyber-physical systems: A literature review,2019,['Cyber-physical systems System smartness Development framework System level reasoning Compositionality'],,"Smart CPSs (S-CPSs) have been evolving beyond what was identiﬁed by the traditional deﬁnitions of CPSs. The objective of our research is to investigate the concepts and implementations of reasoning processes for S-CPSs, and more speciﬁcally, the frameworks proposed for the fuzzy front end of their reasoning mechanisms. The objectives of the paper are: (i) to analyze the framework concepts and implementations of CPS, (ii) to review the literature concerning system-level reasoning and its enablers from the points of view of the processed knowledge, building awareness, reasoning mechanisms, decision making, and adaptation. Our ﬁndings are: (i) awareness and adaptation behaviors are considered as system-level smartness of S-CPSs that are not achieved by traditional design approaches; (ii) model-based and com-posability approaches insufﬁciently support the development of reasoning mechanisms for S-CPSs; (iii) frameworks for development of reasoning in S-CPS should support compositional design. Based on the conclusions above, we argue that coping with the challenges of compositionality requires both software-level integration and holistic fusion of knowledge by means of semantic transformations. This entails the need for a multi aspect framework that is able to capture at least conceptual, functional, architectural, informational, interoperation, and behavioral aspects. It needs further investigation if a compositionality enabling framework should appear in the form of a meta-framework (abstract) or in the form of a semantically integrated (concrete) framework."

Then it is transiently simulated by electromagnetic analysis software to calculate the radial and tangential components of the core magnetic density of the generator. At the same time, the calculation results of the finite element method are compared with the results of the analysis method to verify the correctness of the analytical method model. Finally, the calculated magnetic density component is transformed by Fourier transformation to obtain the corresponding harmonic analysis.

Evaluation of Propofol in Comparison  with Other General Anesthetics for  Surgery in Children Younger than 3  Years: a Systematic Review and   Meta-Analysis,2019,"['Propofol', 'General Anesthesia', 'Infant', 'Child', 'Systematic Review']",,"Background: Despite well-known advantages, propofol remains off-label in many countries for general anesthesia in children under 3 years of age due to insufficient evidence regarding its use in this population. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of propofol compared with other general anesthetics in children under 3 years of age undergoing surgery through a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing randomized clinical trials.Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted of MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to find all randomized clinical trials comparing propofol with another general anesthetic that included children under 3 years of age. The relative risk or arcsine-transformed risk difference for dichotomous outcomes and the weighted or standardized mean difference for continuous outcomes were estimated using a random-effects model.Results: A total of 249 young children from 6 publications were included. The children who received propofol had statistically significantly lower systolic and diastolic blood pressures, but hypotension was not observed in the propofol groups. The heart rate, stroke volume index, and cardiac index were not significantly different between the propofol and control groups. The propofol groups showed slightly shorter recovery times and a lower incidence of emergence agitation than the control groups, while no difference was observed for the incidence of hypotension, desaturation, and apnea.Conclusion: This systematic review and meta-analysis indicates that propofol use for general anesthesia in young healthy children undergoing surgery does not increase complications and that propofol could be at least comparable to other anesthetic agents."

The optimum LaCoO3 produced was tested for its capability in removing methyl orange (MO) and rhodamine B (RhB) dyes from aqueous solution. Calcination temperature and calcination time were optimized with the responses being percentage yield, MO and RhB removal. The best temperature and calcination time obtained were 775 oC and 62mins, respectively, giving good and appreciable values for the three responses. The resulting optimal LaCoO3 was characterized by Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR), ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry (UV/vis), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), pH of zero point charge (pHpzc) as well as BET analysis, yielding a mesoporous adsorbent with surface area of 61.130m2 g−1 as well as 223.55 and 239.45mg g−1 as the monolayer adsorption capacity values for MO and RhB, respectively. Freundlich model was the best in describing the equilibrium adsorption data with respect to both MO and RhB with the kinetic data for the two dyes both obeying pseudo-second-order kinetics model."

However, one significant drawback behind the application of CNNs in hyperspectral images is the high dimensionality of the data, which increases the training time and processing complexity. To address this problem, several CNN based hyperspectral image classification studies have exploited PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for dimensionality reduction. One limitation to this is that the spectral information of the original image can be lost through PCA. Although it is clear that the use of PCA affects the accuracy and the CNN training time, the impact of PCA for CNN based hyperspectral image classification has been understudied. The purpose of this study is to analyze the quantitative effect of PCA in CNN for hyperspectral image classification. The hyperspectral images were first transformed through PCA and applied into the CNN model by varying the size of the reduced dimensionality. In addition, 2D-CNN and 3D-CNN frameworks were applied to analyze the sensitivity of the PCA with respect to the convolution kernel in the model. Experimental results were evaluated based on classification accuracy, learning time, variance ratio, and training process. The size of the reduced dimensionality was the most efficient when the explained variance ratio recorded 99.7%~99.8%. Since the 3D kernel had higher classification accuracy in the original-CNN than the PCA-CNN in comparison to the 2D-CNN, the results revealed that the dimensionality reduction was relatively less effective in 3D kernel."

MTD<sub>151</sub>-EGF의 유전자가 coding된 vector로 형질전환된 대장균에서MTD<sub>151</sub>-EGF 발현시킨 후 정제를 진행하였다. 정제된 MTD-EGF를 대상으로 세포증식시험, 세포독성시험, 생체외 피부흡수시험 그리고 인공피부를 이용한 경피투과능을 평가하였다. 99% 이상 고순도로 정제된MTD<sub>151</sub>-EGF의 세포증식 활성은 EGF 대비 동등 이상의 수준이었으며, 세포독성은 관찰되지 않았다. 또한, 인공피부 투과모델에서 FITC로 표지된 EGF와 MTD<sub>151</sub>-EGF의 진피층까지의 투과를 공초점 현미경으로 관찰한 결과, MTD<sub>151</sub>-EGF는 EGF 대비 우수한 투과능을 보였으며, 경피흡수 시스템을 이용한 투과물질의 정량분석 결과, EGF 대비 약 16 배 이상 투과량이 많은 것으로 확인되었다. 이러한 결과들은 다양한 활성물질들의화장품용 원료로서의 경피투과에 MTD가 기존의 물리적인 경피투과 방법을 효율적으로 개선한 대안이 될것으로 판단된다.","The epidermal growth factor (EGF) has a intrinsic function of inducing growth and proliferation of cells through interacting with cell membrane receptors in human epidermis and dermis layer. These functions of EGF are used as a main ingredient for wound healing medicines and anti-aging cosmetics. As a cosmetic ingredient, the EGF has a problem in exhibiting its natural efficacy due to the lack of the ability to penetrate through the stratum corneum, which is known as the skin barrier. In this study, a recombinant human epidermal growth factor (MTD<sub>151</sub>-EGF) fused with the macromolecule transduction domain (MTD)<sub>151</sub> with the skin penetration ability was developed to improve the skin penetration efficiency of the EGF. Expression of MTD<sub>151</sub>-EGF was performed in E. coli transformed with a vector encoding the MTD<sub>151</sub>-EGF gene and then purified. The purified MTD<sub>151</sub>-EGF was evaluated using cell proliferation assay, cytotoxicity test and skin penetration test by franz diffusion cell assay and artificial skin. Cell proliferation activity of MTD<sub>151</sub>-EGF purified to high purity of 99% or above was equivalent to the EGF or better, and cytotoxicity was not observed. In addition, the MTD<sub>151</sub>-EGF showed an excellent penetration efficiency compared to the EGF in the skin penetration test with EGF and MTD<sub>151</sub>-EGF labeled by FITC in an artificial skin penetration model. Based on the quantitative analysis of the penetrating substance using franz diffusion cell assay, the amount of penetration was about 16 times more than that of EGF. These results can be regarded as an effective alternative to improve the existing physical transdermal penetration method related to the use of various active ingredients for cosmetics."

Of course, the North Korean nuclear issue is still not solved. But North Korea may soon make economic reforms and open doors to sustain its regime. In order to have a debate on which models to reference or to implant in North Korea, it will be important to assess the current situation there and understand why certain foreign cases can serve as samples for the North. In this context, this study intends to explain why North Korea will have no choice but to take an interest in Vientnam’s Doi Moi policy and inevitably benchmark Vietnam’s economic reform and opening model. Since the initial condition of a regime prior to its transformation has an important bearing on the selection and implementation of strategies, it must be analyzed before developing economic reform policies. To compare Vietnam and North Korea, this paper compares the initial conditions in four subjects: crisis for regime, leadership change, external relations factor, level of economic development."
Adsorption Behavior and Mechanism of Tripolyphosphate on Synthetic Goethite,2019,"['Tripolyphosphate', 'Adsorption', 'Goethite', 'Organic matter', 'Mechanism']",,"In order to study the transport behavior of tripolyphosphate (TPP) in aqueous solutions, the adsorption process of TPP on synthetic goethite, which exists stably in supergene environment, has been systematically studied. The adsorption properties under different conditions (pH, electrolyte presence, and temperature) were investigated. The adsorption of TPP in the presence of humic acid (HA)/fulvic acid (FA) has also been discussed in this paper. The results indicated that the adsorption capacity quickly increased within the first hour and equilibrium was reached within 24 h. The adsorption capacity decreased from 1.98 to 0.27 mg·g<sup>-1</sup> upon increasing the pH from 8.5 to 11.0, whereas the adsorption of TPP on goethite hardly changed with increasing electrolyte concentration. The results of analysis of the kinetic and isothermal models showed that the adsorption was more in accord with the pseudo second-order equation and Freundlich model. The adsorption capacity decreased obviously regardless of the order of addition of TPP, HA, and goethite. Subsequent addition of FA led to a large increase in the adsorption capacity, which might be attributed to the adsorption ability of FA. According to the predictions of the kinetic and isothermal models and the spectroscopic evidence (X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and scanning electron microscope (SEM)), the adsorption mechanism may be mainly based on surface complexation and physical adsorption."
Stratified electromagnetohydrodynamic flow of nanofluid supporting convective role,2019,"['EMHD Nanofluid', 'Thermal Radiation', 'Chemical Reaction', 'Stratification', 'Convective Conditions']",,"This study numerically examined unsteady double stratified EMHD mixed convection flow of nanofluid via permeable stretching sheet. It also looked at the convective heat and mass boundary conditions as well as the Navier velocity slip. In the thermal field, the effects of radiative heat transfer, heat generation/absorption, viscous dissipation, together with Ohmic heating (both magnetic and electric fields) were considered. The concentration field accounts for the chemical reaction. These show the physical behavior of electromagnetohydrodynamic flow associated with the problem formulation. The characteristics in regard to convective heat and mass, Navier slips conditions, as well as double stratification, were imposed. Such structure arises in energy efficiency and performance, which is achievable without higher pumping power, serves in the extrusion manufacturing process involving the thermal system for efficient devices particularly in polymeric, paper production, and food processing. The governing equations, which are nonlinear partial differential equations, were modelled by ordinary differential equations using suitable transformations.The ODEs were solved numerically, using implicit finite difference method (Keller box method). The physical implications deliberated on the behavior via the velocity, thermal energy, and concentration fields as well as the skin friction coefficient; the Nusselt and Sherwood numbers were scrutinized in relation to several parameters via mathematical model. The analysis shows that thermal and concentration stratifications decrease the distributions adjacent to the sheet surface, indicating decrease in the concentration nanoparticles and reduction in thermal energy. Augmentation occurs with convective heat and mass Biot numbers with the fields. The electric and magnetic parameters exhibit opposite flow behavior to the velocity and temperature. Chemical reaction and viscous dissipation weaken the concentration profile. Numerical results were compared with the published data available in the literature for limiting cases, and good agreement was noticed."

As a result, the significant wave height (H1/3) was in the range of 0.07~1.57 m and the mean value was 0.21 m. The maximum wave height (Hmax) was in the range of 0.02-4.76m and the mean value was 0.27m. The vertical wave height and cycles were estimated through numerical model experiments of wave transformation. The 50-year frequency design wave height ranged from 0.82m to 3.75m. As a result of the experiment of wave-induced current, wave-induced current in the CHUNG-UI beach was decreased after the installation of the Detached breakwater and the Jetty. On the other hand, when the crest elevation was increased up to 5 m, there was no significant change, but when the crest elevation was increased to 8m, strong wave-induced current occurred around the submerged breakwaters due to lowered depth of water. In addition, the main erosion of the CHUNG-UI beach is due to the intensive invasion of the wave characteristics coming from the outer sea into the white sandy beach. The deformation of the wave centered on the front of the sandy beach caused additional longshore currents flowing parallel to the sandy beach and rip currents in the transverse direction, thus confirming that the longshore sediment was moved out of the front and out of the sea. The results of this study can be used as preliminary data for the recovery of the sand and the selection of efficient erosion prevention facilities."

This period belongs to the initial stage in the Chinese history of translating Buddhist texts. Therefore it's not too much to presume that themes of Rāmāyaṇa had been spread in the Buddhist sphere of Northeast Asia through Buddhist texts. And this is established sufficiently as a fact by the Buddhist texts translated later such as Sutrālaṃkāra-śāstra(大莊嚴論經), Abhidharma-vibhāṣā-śāstra(鞞婆沙論), etc.The fact of that in Mahāyāna Buddhist texts the story of King Rāma is transformed into the direction of emphasizing the peace of the public and the prosperity of the country by sovereign's benevolence is particularly worthy of attention. The model of such a sovereign would been King Rāma, and Ayodhyā(阿踰陁國) that was the country governed by King Rāma would been an utopia deserve to desire to all sovereigns. Though it is later example, the Ayutthaya dynasty (1351~1767) of Thailand caused by designating Ayutthaya as the capital could be a representive case. The kings of many generations in that dynasty had attached Rāma to their royal names. Of course, it is a direct effect of Rāmāyaṇa .However, in light of frequency in use of place names in Buddhist texts, the name of Ayodhyā is rather very rare relatively. Nevertheless, the fact that in legend of Queen Her(許皇后) the legend begins from Ayodhyā could be evidence of having known the story of King Rāma.In the record of Garak country (駕洛國記) included in the Heritage of the Three States (三國遺事), the story about marriage of King Suro (首露王) and Queen Her is full of mysteries. According to it, in the viewpoint of epic literature excluding historical debate, King Suro may be compared to Rāma, and Queen Her may be compared to Sītā or a wife of Rāma.But this author, taking Rāmāyaṇa for an example, focused on grasping the influence of epic literature through textual evidences. Rāmāyaṇa in itself reveals aspects of transformation by supplement, and the themes of it are accepted everywhere of Mahābhārata in the forms of transformation. Even in the inside of India those themes had transformed into the way of developing social ideologies and religious ideas or aims. Such an influence of Rāmāyaṇa had reached even the outside of India.In Southeast Asia, the story of King Rāma contributed toward to form indigenous culture of each region. In the case of Northeast Asia, the story of King Rāma transformed to the direction of enhancing socio-cultural values through Mahāyāna Buddhist texts mainly."

The HPAI outbreak status of each province was used as a dependent variable. The number of poultry farm vehicle movements within the province (within variable), the number of poultry farm vehicle movements from one province to another province (outbound variable), the number of poultry farm vehicle movements from other provinces to one province (inbound variable), and the number of poultry farms in each province were included in the models as independent variables. Results of the OLS model were as follows: the estimated coefficient of the log-transformed within variable was -0.30, that of the log-transformed outbound variable was 0.71, that of the log-transformed inbound variable was -0.30, and that of the number of poultry farms was 0.07; however, only the number of poultry farms per province was statistically significant. Results of the MaxEnt model were as follows: the median relative contribution of the log-transformed outbound variable was 52.0 (range: 12.2–83.9), that of the log-transformed inbound variable was 34.4 (range: 8.8–83.4), that of the log-transformed within variable was 3.7 (range: 1.8–7.3), and that of the number of poultry farms per province was 0.7 (range: 0.0–11.7). The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.683. The results of current study should be helpful for planning a national HPAI surveillance program to locate surveillance resources with the consideration of risk level of provinces."

Friedrich)는 ‘음악의 정신에서 비롯된 비극의 탄생’(1891)에서 코러스를, “더불어 고통 받는 자이면서 동시에 세계의 심장부로부터 지혜를 알리는 현자”라고 했다. 이처럼 코러스는 인간의 내면과 개인의 의식과 무의식의 세계를 탐구할 수 있었다.그리스 연극의 코러스는 현대연극에서 보다 풍부한 새로운 극형식의 모델이 되고 있다. 오늘날 코러스 형식은 중국 연극의 무대 위에서 광범위하게 운영되고 있다. 비록 희곡(戲曲; 각 지방의 전통극)에는 코러스 형식이 없지만, 천극(川劇)에는 방강(幇腔)이 있고, 경극에는 롱타오(龍套; 일반적으로 4명을 한 그룹으로 한다. 호위병의 복장을 하거나 깃발을 든 병졸 역할)가 있다. 막후에서 남녀 혼창인 방강은 무대 위의 1인 창에 대한 다수의 ‘화(和)’가 방강(帮腔)이다. 즉 ‘일창중화(一唱衆和)’의 형식이다. 그러나 롱타오나 방강의 전통적 역할에 구애받지 않고, 무대에 왼쪽에 배치하면 코러스의 시각화를 강조할 수 있다. 또한 극중 인물이 되는가 하면 극중인물에서 이탈하여 서술자가 되기도 한다.동아시아 연극의 코러스 또한 새로운 극형식에 기여할 끊임없는 잠재성을 보여 왔다. 특히 무겐노(夢幻能)의 전후 이장(二場) 구조의 극형식에서 노무대의 주인공 시테(仕手, Shite)는 자신의 신분을 감추고 후반부의 주인공 노치지테(後仕手, Nochi-jite)의 화신(化身)으로 등장하기 때문에 전반부 마에바에서 와키(조연)와 코러스 지우타이의 역할은 마에지테의 정체를 밝히는데 주력한다. 마에지테의 신분이 밝혀지면 전장의 주인공은 퇴장한다. 이렇게 나카이리(中入り, Nakair)가 끝나고 노치바에서 화신이 아닌 자기 자신이 된 주인공의 진술에 협력하는 코러스의 변신은 치유적 은유로서 현대 연극의 극적 사유를 제공한다.무겐노 <오바스테(姨捨), Obasute>을 중심으로 무겐노의 극 구조를 통해 코러스의 변신이 내포하는 자의식 덩어리로서 구원의 모습을 드러내는 ‘개인을 각인하는 의지＇를 아는 존재라는 관점에서 정화적 연극의 본질에 주목하고자 한다. 이에 본 논문은 동아시아 연극의 코러스가 가지고 있는 잠재적 치유적, 진혼적 역할이라는 존재의 심연을 바라보고자 하였다.","The poetic language of the chorus intervenes between the dialogues of characters in the play without participating in the acts of the dramas. In various genres of East Asian oral tradition, descriptive bond transform the chorus function from “one-man multi role” to “unspecified majority” into a mediator, spokesman and audience for the play. In East Asia, the chorus, which presupposes a transformation, not a refrain, has Jiutai(地謠) which is the chorus of Noh(能), BangChang(幫腔) of the Nanxi(南戲) system in Song dynasty, and if you perform as a Kabuki in NingyoJoruri(人形淨瑠璃)series, Chobo spoken by Dayu(太夫). While Chobo is in progress, it's not a doll, but a performance by Yakuza Kabuki(the actor). That's why Kabuki says they need a picture of the view. Noting that the Chobo function is the same function as DoChang(導唱) of Korean ChangGeuk, I would like to discuss the transformation of the chorus in East Asian play.The chorus of ancient Greek plays had almost disappeared from the stage until the 19th century. The chorus was restored in the early 20th century because it was accepted as a heritage of ancient Greek theater. Nietzsche Friedrich, who has found the origin of Greek plays. In Die Geburt der Tragödie aus dem Geiste der Musik(1872), Nietzsche called the chorus “a wise man who is more suffering and at the same time informs wisdom from the heart of the world.” As such, the chorus could explore the world of human inner and individual consciousness and unconsciousness.The Greek chorus is becoming a new model of extreme form of e-pression that is more abundant in modern theater. Nowadays, the chorus form is widely operated on the stage of Chinese plays. Although there is no chorus form in the XiQu(traditional plays in each province), there is a ‘BangQiang’ in the Sichuan Opera and a ‘LongTao’(龍套; generally four people are grouped together in a play. There is a soldier‘s uniform or flag-carrying role). Bangchang, which is a mixed sound between men and women sing behind the scenes, is the majority of ‘He(和)’ about one-man sing on stage. In other words, it is a form of ‘Yi-Chang-Zhong-He(一唱衆和; one sing, others together)’. But regardless of the traditional role of ‘Long Tao’ or BangChang, placing them on the left on the stage can emphasize the chorus's visualization. In addition, he may become a character in the drama, or a narrator, away from being in the drama.The chorus of East Asian plays has also shown a constant potential to contribute to the new theatrical form. Especially, the main character of the Noh stage reveals his identity and tells his story through the “transformation of chorus.” This dramatic process is especially manifested in the polar form of the Mugen-Noh(夢幻能)'s two stages. In other words, the protagonist of the Noh stage is a spiritual being recalling the past of his life, and as the main character Maejite(前仕手, the former Shite) in Maeba(前場), who hides his own identity hidden by the mask of the agony after his death, and appears as the incarnation of the later main character, Nochi-jite(後仕手, the later Shite). Therefore, the Waki(the supporting role) in Maeba and the chorus Jiutai focus on revealing the identity of the Maejite. When his identity is revealed, the main character of Maeba disappears. After Nakairi(the exit of the maejite)'s done, the transformation of the chorus, which cooperates with the statement of the main character who became himself in Nochi-ba(後場), is a healing metaphor, providing the dramatic reason for modern theater.I would like to pay attention to the essence of the purified play from the perspective of knowing the ""will to imprint on individuals"" that reveals salvation as a self-conscious mass implied by the transformation of the chorus through Mugen-Noh ‘Obaster(姨捨)’. Therefore, this paper tries to look at the abyss of the existence of the potential healing and ..."

In this study, we hypothesize the effects of transformational leadership and team support on creativity and examine resiliency as mediation mechanisms between independent variables and creativity. To advance the analysis, we collected data from 137 employees including CP, PD, and writers in media industry, We designed a robust research model in order to assess model fit and avoid issues of common method variance. Using the verified model, standardized path coefficients were examined to test research hypotheses. Supporting the most predictions, the results show that transformational leadership has a positive impact on creativity and the effect was fully mediated by resiliency. However, the relationship between perceived team support and creativity was partially mediated through resiliency. We discuss implications of findings in details."

This study was conducted by retrieving data from 249 employees of the financial industry. Respondents are 60 in the metropolitan area, 62 in the Gyeongnam area, 56 in the Chungcheong area, and 71 in the regional area. The results of this study are as follows: First, it shows that there is a correlation between transformational leadership and Ambidextours organizational. Second, transformational leadership has a positive effect on the Ambidextrous organizational. Ideal influence, intellectual stimulation, and individual care influenced the organization of both sides of subordinate factors of transformational leadership. In particular, as a result of comparison of influence, intellectual stimulation (β = 0.388)> individual consideration (β = 0.316) (β = 0.159), respectively. In other words, managers of financial institutions should stimulate members intellectually in their beliefs, values, thinking and imagination, problem recognition and resolution, rather than doing something emotionally. Managers should be aware that they have a one-to-one relationship with each individual member and should take individual care to meet the individual needs of the members through different treatment. Managers should exert their ideal influence by transferring authority to the members, enhancing the self-confidence of the members, and role model of the members through the high morality of the management, reasonable human relations, confidence in the success, and excellent practical knowledge. Therefore, financial institutions tend to work conservatively and strengthen stable activities, so that they can cope with a rapidly changing environment by closely considering the relationship between subordinate variables of transformational leadership and subordinate variables of the Ambidextrous organizational. It will be able to create organizational performance."
Robust IMC-PID and Parameter-varying Control Strategies for Automated Blood Pressure Regulation,2019,"['Blood pressure regulation', 'internal model control', 'loop-shaping', 'non-minimum phase systems', 'time delay systems', 'time-varying time-delay', 'uncertainty and robust control']",,"The present work focuses on comparing a robust and a parameter-varying control design approach forautomatically regulating blood pressure in critical hypotensive patients using vasopressor drug infusion. Meanarterial pressure (MAP) response of a patient subject to vasoactive drugs is modeled by a first-order dynamicalsystem with time-varying parameters and a time-varying delay in the control input which limits the implementationof conventional control techniques. Two methods are examined to address the variability and the time-varying delayof the physiological response to the drug. First, a Padé approximation is used to transform the infinite-dimensionaldelay problem into a finite-dimensional model represented in the form of a non-minimum phase (NMP) system. Asystematic parameter-varying loop-shaping control is proposed to provide the closed-loop system with stability andtracking performance in the presence of measurement noise and disturbances. Second, an internal model control(IMC) strategy is examined to design a fixed proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller cascaded with a lagcompensator by considering the time-varying model to be a perturbed uncertain system. To account for systemuncertainty, the small-gain theorem is employed by which robust stability conditions are investigated. The proposedcontrol methods are applied to critical hypotensive patient resuscitation to regulate MAP while considering thelimitations posed by the time-varying parameters of the physiological response model and the large time-varyingdelay. Simulation results are provided and compared to evaluate the performance of the proposed control actionsunder various hypotensive scenarios."

The grid-based results of GCMs were transformed to all considered meteorological stations using inverse distance weighted (IDW) method and its results were compared to the observed precipitation. Six quantile mapping methods and random forest method were used to correct the bias between GCM’s and the observation data. Thus, the empirical quantile which belongs to non-parameteric transformation method was selected as a best bias correction method by comparing the measures of performance indicators. Then, one of the multi-criteria decision techniques, TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Ideal Solution), was used to find the representative GCM using the performances of four GCMs after the bias correction using empirical quantile method. As a result, GISS-E2-R was the best and followed by MIROC5, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, and CCSM4. Because these results are limited several GCMs, different results will be expected if more GCM data considered."

By modeling the constant input delay with a first-order PdE (Partial difference Equation), we replace the input delay with the PdE states. By applying a backstepping transformation, we build a target system that enables to construct an explicit Lyapunov function. Constructing the explicit Lyapunov function that covers the entire state variables, we prove the existence of an allowable maximum size of the structured model uncertainty to maintain stability and establish the robustness of the predictor feedback controller. The numerical example demonstrates that the stability of closed-loop system is maintained in the presence of the structured model uncertainty, and verifies the robustness of the predictor feedback controller."

The first pair of canards, called pitch canards, is used as the pitch and yaw attitude control effector, and the second pair, called spin canards, is used to generate the rotation of the fuze. Due to the highly rotating motion of the munition, the cross coupling effect between the pitch and yaw axes is significant. To decouple the pitch and yaw axes, the neural network-based L1 adaptive control with dynamic model inversion is proposed in this paper. We also present a coordinate transformation for the controller of the rotating guided munition. The 7 DOF nonlinear simulation model was conducted to validate the results of the controller."

In this new environment, quality-of-life breast reconstructive surgery for those who have undergone a mastectomy for breast cancer treatment has become ever-more attractive. However, there is a problem that occurs, where post-reconstruction breast shapes differ from those before mastectomy. This is caused by insufficient geometric information for the breasts to be reconstructed. Therefore, patients not only go on to suffer inconvenience in daily life, but they also experience a loss of psychological self-esteem owing to an asymmetrical body. In this study, we generate three-dimensional (3D) breast shapes by extracting geometric information from fat and fibro-glandular breast tissues from a series of magnetic resonance imaging images, which are acquired during pre-mastectomy examinations. We then apply a Neo-Hookean material model, which is a hyper-elastic material property model being considered for natural breast-shape deformability. We then use finite element analysis to model the 3D breast by accounting for its deformation characteristics, finally proposing a method to transform the model breast into a shape indicative of a natural, standing posture."

Many cities in the world have carried out a large-scale urban development project in order to deal with such the socio-economic problems. Particularly cities in North America and Europe, it is now a common feature of urban development and growth strategy for transforming decrepit and ruined waterfront areas into gentrified urban landscape. This is usually implemented by gentrification strategy through large-scale physical development projects with the provision of high-end housing, commercial, business and leisure facilities, and cultural and art related amenities. The gentrification strategy through the large-scale urban physical development is an essential feature of entrepreneurial approaches which pursues the activation of private investments in order to be more competitive over rival cities and achieve urban growth through growth-oriented urban development. Public and private partnership is also an essential element in the gentrification strategy, but it becomes a part of governance strategy that divides into a municipally-led model controlled by public sector and a developer-led model controlled by private sector. However, more importantly, the different governance strategy, especially differences in principal agents, seems to lead to different outcomes substantially. The aim of this article is to conduct a comparative study on two typical cases of the gentrification strategy through large-scale urban development projects, such as the Clyde Waterfront Regeneration project in Glasgow and the Kop van Zuid Development project in Rotterdam, to analyse effects and limitations by evaluating the projects’vision, goal and principal agents, and also to draw on the implication from these projects."
자크 엘륄의 인격주의 운동과 혁명적 기독교,2019,"['자크 엘륄', '인격주의 운동', '필요한 혁명', '혁명적 기독교', 'Jacques Ellul', 'Mouvement personnaliste', 'Revolution necessaire', 'Christianisme revolutionnaire']","기독교적인 토대 위에서 이루어진 엘륄의 인격주의 운동은 다음 같은 출발점으로부터 시작한다. 즉, 혁명 활동을 수행하기 위해서는 현존하는 모든 모델, 곧 민주 정당이나 각종 연맹이나 전체주의 정당의 모델에서 벗어나야 하고, 개인적인 동시에 집단적인 변혁을 이루어야 하며, 그 변혁에는 공동체적 방식만을 적용해야 한다는 것이다. 엘륄에게 혁명은 근본적으로 사회를 변혁시키는 것이다. 따라서 그가 ‘필요한 혁명’이라고 부르는 ‘진정한 혁명’은 사회 및 문명 전체와 관련되고, 기술화에 직접 연결되어 있으며, 기술 환경 속에서의 인간 존재 자체와 관련된다. 결국, ‘필요한 혁명’은 기술화된 국가와 기술 사회에 맞서 일어나는 것이다. 그렇지만 현대 사회에서는 혁명을 통한 급격한 단절은 가능하지 않고, 기술 사회에서는 진정한 혁명 의식을 발견할 수 없다. 그 때문에, 기술 사회에서 혁명이 더는 가능하지 않고 ‘필요한 혁명’에 대한 희망이 사라진 듯 하지만, 기술 사회에서 인간은 여전히 ‘반란’을 시도할 수 있고, 자신에게 강요되는 것을 본능적이고 자발적으로 거부할 수 있다. 그러므로 완전히 새로운 기술 사회에서 지나간 혁명 모델은 전혀 유용하지 않고, 유일하게 혁명이 이루어지는 장소는 개인의 의식이며, 자유로운 인간에 의해서만 혁명이 이루어질 따름이다. 그 상황에서 유일하게 가능한 혁명은 권력 차지가 아니라, 현대 기술의 긍정적 잠재력을 확보하면서 인간 해방이라는 방향으로 현대 기술들의 방향을 설정하는 것이다. 그러한 혁명을 통해 기술이 종속될 수 있는 동시에, 체계로서의 기술 체계가 파괴될 수 있고, 국가의 권력이 사라질 수 있으며, 평등이 실현될 수 있고, 소외가 그칠 수 있다. 그런데, 이 시대의 본질적인 특성은 ‘필요한 혁명’을 시도하려는 갈망에 대립하는 문명의 깊은 정체 상태가 있다는 것이고, ‘진정한 혁명’이 불가능하다는 것이다. 근본 문제가 국가 형태나 경제 형태를 바꾸는 것이라면, 끊임없이 문제제기를 해야 할 세상의 문명 구조를 변화시키는 것이기에, 이 세상에서의 혁명적 역할을 하도록 부름을 받은 그리스도인들은 자신들의 상황이 본질적으로 혁명적임을 인식해야 한다. 그리스도인들은 모든 사회적 순응과 완전히 결별한 상태에서 자신의 사고와 행동을 통해 예언적 사명을 부여받기 때문에 현실 속에서 종말론의 힘을 지닌다. 따라서 예수 그리스도의 영광스러운 재림에 대한 소망은 그리스도인들을 기술적 독재에 맞설 수 있게 하는 혁명적인 상황에 놓이게 한다. 결국, 사회를 변화시킬 수 있는 진정한 기독교는 ‘혁명적 기독교’이며, 자신들이 사는 사회를 변화시킬 능력이 있는 사람들이 있다면, 그들은 바로 그리스도인들이다.","Le mouvement personnaliste de Jacques Ellul fonde sur des valeurs chretiennes, a pour point de depart l’idee suivante : pour mettre en pratique les activites revolutionnaires, il faudra quitter tous les modèles existants tels que les partis democratiques, toutes sortes de federations ou encore les partis totalitaires. Il faudra alors executer cette reforme de façon individuelle et collective et n’y appliquer que la methode communautaire. Chez Ellul, la revolution consiste à reformer fondamentalement la societe. Ainsi cette revolution authentique qu’il appelle aussi ‘la revolution necessaire’ est relative à la societe et à toute la civilisation. Elle est directement liee à la technicisation et est en relation avec l’etre humain lui-meme. En somme, ‘la revolution necessaire’ consiste à se dresser contre l’État technicise et la societe technicienne. Pourtant, la rupture brusque engendree par cette revolution n’est pas possible dans notre societe moderne et la veritable conscience revolutionnaire ne peut etre trouvee dans la societe technicienne. De ce fait, il semble que la revolution ne soit plus possible et que l’espoir de ‘la revolution necessaire’ ait dispau dans la societe technicienne. Cependant l’homme peut essayer de declencher ‘la revolte’ et refuser de manière instinctive et consciente ce qui s’impose à lui-meme. C’est ainsi que les modèles revolutionnaires desuets ne sont en aucun cas efficaces dans notre societe technicienne tout à fait nouvelle, et que le seul lieu où la revolution pourrait s’effectuer, c’est dans la conscience individuelle. En effet, la revolution ne peut s’accomplir que par l’homme libre, la seule revoluion possible dans cette situation etant de ne pas s’emparer du pouvoir, mais d’orienter les techniques modernes vers la liberation de l’homme en preservant leurs cotes positifs. Grace à cette revolution, la technique pourra etre subordonnee, le système technicien en tant que système pourra etre detruit, le pouvoir de l’État pourra disparaitre, l’egalite pourra etre mise en place et la desalienation pourra cesser. Or, les caracterisques essentielles de notre temps, c’est qu’il existe un statisme profond de la civilisation en opposition avec l’ardent desir de tenter ‘la revolution necessaire’, ce qui rend impossible ‘la revolution authentique’. Si le problème fondamental n’est pas de changer de formes economiques, mais de transformer la structure de notre civilisation qui devrait etre mise en question, ce sont les Chretiens qui sont appeles à remplir ce role revolutionnaire. Ils doivent reconnaitre que leur situation est essentiellement revolutionnaire. En effet, dans notre realite, les Chretiens detiennent la force eschatologique, en raison de la mission prophetique qui leur est attribuee au moyen de leurs idees et actions, puisqu’ils sont parfaitement separes de tous les conformismes sociaux. C’est ainsi que l’esperance du retour glorieux de Jesus Christ fait que les Chretiens se retrouvent dans une situation revolutionnaire où ils peuvent faire face à la dictature technicienne. Au bout du compte, s’il y a un christianisme authentique susceptible de transformer la societe, c’est bien justement ‘le christianisme revolutionnaire’, et s’il y a des personnes capables de transformer la societe, ce sont indubitablement les Chretiens."

RNN and CNN based models, which are widely used for solving the task, involve reading and processing the text in a sequential manner. This creates inefficiency in learning dependencies between far-apart words. On the contrary, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) architecture is capable of processing more complex graph-structured data, thus having potential to recognize and learn from complex linguistic structures.In the present work, we transform text sequences into graphs by assigning each word in the text as a node and representing the relationship between words as edges. We then propose a method for solving text classification that uses recent GCN architectures to take the transformed text-graph as input, learn hidden representations, and output a single hidden representation for classification. In our experiments, our proposed model outperformed RNN and CNN based models with regards to various text classification tasks."

For this purpose, systems thinking level model, which can be applied to education or science education, was selected through literature analysis. Eight pre-service teachers’ systems thinking were investigated through the systems thinking analysis tool used in domestic research.The systems thinking presented by the pre-service teachers were transformed into the box type causal map using Sibley et al. (2007). Two researchers analyzed the systems thinking using rubrics of evaluating systems thinking. For data analysis, quantitative analysis was performed through correlation analysis using SPSS. In addition, the qualitative analysis of the box type causal map was conducted and the consistency with the quantitative analysis results was verified. The results indicated that the correlation between the 5-Likert systems thinking measurement instrument and the rubrics score was highly correlated with the Pearson product-moment of .762 (p <.05). In the hierarchical correlation of the systems thinking level, the STH model was analyzed with a very high correlation with the Pearson product-moment of .722∼.791, and 4-step model was analyzed .381∼.730. The qualitative analysis suggested the concept to be included in the low level of system thinking, the higher the level, the less the concept that is presented properly.In conclusion, the level of systems thinking can be derived as a result of research that there is clearly, a hierarchical part. Based on the results of this study, it is necessary to develop a systems thinking level model applicable to science education and develop and validate items that can measure the level of systems thinking."
Investigation on Dielectric Failure of High Voltage Equipment in Substation Caused by Capacitor Bank Switching,2019,['ATP-EMTP · Capacitor bank switching · Electrical transient · Inrush current · Restriking voltage · Transient recovery voltage'],,"This paper investigates transient phenomenon of electrical stresses caused by capacitor bank switching, damaging HV equipment in substation. The system of aged air-insulated 115 kV substation is modeled by using Alternative Transients Program- Electromagnetic Transients Program. The failed current transformer (CT) was comprehensively modeled and investigated.The comprehensive model for electrical transient simulation has been developed by using actual data and derived data from real physical dimension of equipment. The simulated results are challenged by comparison of the results from theoretical calculation according to international standard and the results from simulation including on-site measurement. The comparison results to verify the accuracy of the developed model are satisfactory. The results show that electrical stresses aff ecting CT by voltage stress exceeds CT’s 123 kV rating together with the frequent switching operations as hundreds of times per year. These lead to degradation of CT insulation, especially at the top insulation portion close to HV terminal due to nonlinear voltage distribution. Consequently, CT explosion fi nally occurred. This developed model is used as an eff ective tool for switching transient investigation to determine electrical stresses caused by various switching operations. With the known electrical stresses, the proper rating of equipment in HV substation can be selected."

This result is the over-fitting problem caused by an increase in model complexity when the model is focused only on a given dataset. Some regularization and resampling methods have been introduced to reduce test errors by alleviating this problem but have been designed for use with only a given dataset. In this paper, we propose a new optimization approach to reduce test errors by transforming a test error minimization problem into a training error minimization problem. To carry out this transformation, we needed additional data for the given dataset, termed pseudo data. To make proper use of pseudo data, we used three types of missing data imputation techniques. As an optimization tool, we chose the least squares method and combined it with an extra pseudo data instance. Furthermore, we present the numerical results supporting our proposed approach, which resulted in less test errors than the ordinary least squares method."

A Stability Condition on Nominal System Recovery of PMSM Against Mixed Uncertainties Using a Full-Order Load Torque Observer,2019,['Load torque observer PMSM Singular perturbation theory Boundary-layer system Proportional integral observer'],,"Since the feedforward compensation using a load torque observer for permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) has been widely used so that an outer feedback loop controller can be designed independently by considering only the nominal plant model, this paper presents an explicit theoretical analysis on the robust performance based on the singular perturbation theory. Unlike the previous result on a reduced-order load torque observer, a stability condition as well as a new coordinate transformation for the boundary-layer system is found out to obtain the desired quasi-steady-state model that equals to the nominal PMSM equation. When the observer gains satisfy the stability condition for the boundary-layer system, as the observer poles are placed sufficiently left of the complex plane, the disturbance observer-based compensation can recover the nominal system characteristics without accounting for model uncertainties that include external disturbances as well as some model parameter uncertainties. Computer simulations verify the disturbance estimation performance against variations of parameters and the disturbance"

Then, ageneralized approximate input-output model is established to cancel the effect of unstable zeros in NMP systems.The generalized model can be transformed into different forms, which represents a class of approximate modelssuitable for this situation. Based on this model, a controller, called the GIODSMC, is presented. Unlike existingworks, the developed controller ensures precision motion control for PEA with NMP property. Moreover, additionalcontrol parameters are not required to stabilize the NMP systems, and neither a hysteresis model nor a stateobserver is needed for the developed method. Stability of the closed-loop system is theoretically analyzed. At last,the presented method is tested through numerical simulations and experimental investigations on a piezoelectricactuator device."

First, the fandom phenomenon, which shows subjective and collective behavior in a space on a social network rather than physical space, was defined from a data service perspective. The fandom model has been transformed into a collective level of customer Persona that has been analyzed at a personal level in traditional service design, and social network analysis that analyzes consumers' big data has been presented as an efficient way to pattern and visually analyze it. Consumer data collected through social leasing were pre-processed by column based on correlation, stability, missing, and ID-ness. Based on the above data, the company's brand strategy was divided into active and passive interventions and the effect of this strategic attitude on the growth direction of the consumer's fandom community was analyzed. To this end, the fandom model of consumers was proposed by dividing it into four strategies that the brand strategy had: stand-alone, decentralized, integrated and centralized, and the fandom shape of consumers was proposed as a growth model analysis technique that analyzes changes over time."

Modeling techniques by transforming a geometric shape can reduce the RCS area, which can be used to develop stealth unmanned surface vehicles. In order to reduce the RCS, the existing Top Mast part was moved 1m to the tail part, the 5 degree tilt angle was moved below 0.5 m, and additional guided walls were installed to minimize the influence on the center and surrounding corner reflecting structures. As a result of comparing and analyzing the RCS analysis value with the existing model, it can be seen that the reduced countermeasure model is -3.79 dB lower than the existing model for all elevations. In particular, it can be seen that the strong scattering phenomenon is substantially removed in the region except the sacrificial angle region. In addition, it can be seen that in the case of -5m to 2m where the guide wall is added, the reflected signal is improved up to 20 to 40 dB or more, so that it does not appear on the 2D ISAR image.

Hydrogenated amorphous silicon and the related thin film silicon material showed material properties significantly different from those of crystalline silicon, such as a wider band gap of about 1.7 eV, instead of the 1.1 eV in crystalline silicon, an elevated absorption coefficient, and characteristics of a direct bandgap. From a material point of view, an ellipsometry measurement is an indirect measurement because the result is usually given by a change in the polarization state of the probe light, so the ellipsometry measurement result must be transformed into meaningful parameters by modeling the measurement result. We used Tauc-Lorentz dispersion to model the ellipsometry measurement of the thin silicon film. In this paper, we discuss the modeling of spectroscopic ellipsometry data from thin-film silicon materials and the verification of the modeling result by using data from a complementary hydrogen effusion experiment"
A Method to Robustify Exact Linearization Against Parameter Uncertainty,2019,"['Differential flatness', 'exact linearization', 'H∞ controller synthesis', 'robust control', '2-DOF robotic arm']",,"This paper addresses the issue of uncertain parameters in the case of the control of nonlinear systems which are exact linearizable by state feedback. It is shown that the linearizing feedback may be complemented by an additional obustifying compensator, designed to ensure robust stability and performance against the uncertainty of some model parameters. This allows to bridge two state-of-the-art design methodologies such as exact linearization and robust control synthesis. Exact linearization allows the transformation of nonlinear dynamics into linear ones by an eventually dynamic state feedback and by a change of coordinates. However, due to the uncertain nature of some model parameters, their nominal values used in the transformation may be different from their real values. This parameter misfit implies that the resulting transformed dynamics may still include non-linearities or may be a linear system, but different from the one that results for the nominal parameter values. The paper proposes a procedure to cover the uncertainties remaining after exact linearization and to design an additional linear compensator, denoted by K(s), to ensure robust performance and stability. The design of the compensator K(s) involves standard H∞ techniques, based on an output multiplicative uncertainty structure. The weighting matrices of the output multiplicative structure are obtained such that they cover a model set obtained by linearizing the transformed nonlinear system over a sufficiently fine grid above the uncertain parameter range. The suggested approach is illustrated by multiple (SISO and MIMO) examples, including a two-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm. It is shown by simulation that the additional robustifying compensator may stabilize the system for parameter values that would result in unstable behavior without its application and may also result in a better tracking performance."

In the present work, to solve the existing problems, the existing sentiment lexicon was used to assign sentiment score, and when there was sentiment transformation element, the sentiment score was reset through dependency parsing and morphological analysis for automatic generation of large-scale train set labeled with the sentiment. The Top-k data with high sentiment score was extracted. Sentiment transformation elements include sentiment reversal, sentiment activation, and sentiment deactivation. Our experimental results reveal the generation of a large-scale train set in a shorter time than manual labeling and improvement in the performance of deep learning with an increase in the amount of train set. The accuracy of the model using only sentiment lexicon was 80.17% and the accuracy of the proposed model, which includes natural language processing technology was 89.17%. Overall, a 9% improvement was observed."
Energy management for households considering uncertainty in solar irradiance with various probability distribution,2019,['Smart household PV system Optimal residential load control Time-of-using pricing'],,"The electricity load scheduling problem in a household with roof-top photovoltaic (PV) system can efficiently reduce customers’ payments. Compared with previous works in which common flat rate (CFR) has been used, this paper study the case where the time-of-use pricing (TOUP) is adopt. Two conditional equations are constructed for different gains of customers. This is caused by different power direction between the household and the main grid. The two conditional gains equations for the customer are transformed into linear equations by introducing auxiliary variables and linear expression techniques. As a result, established mathematical model to maximize gains for customer is transformed into a mixed integer linear programing (MILP) problem. Thus the resulting MILP model can be easily solved by existing powerful commercial solver. The adjustable and rating power consumption property of appliances are both considered. There are two different mathematic models for them respectively. The impact of reduction of the maximum exchange power between the household and the main grid on gains of the customer, gains of the main grid, load demand during off-peak time and energy exported to the main grid is also studied. The validity and feasibility of the proposed model is illustrated by the case studies."

Three infiltration methods were implemented to reflect the effect of initial loss by reservoirs: ""SCS-CN""(Scheme I), ""SCS-CN"" with simple surface method(Scheme II), and ""Initial and Constant rate""(Scheme III). Modeling processes include incorporating three different methods for loss due to infiltration, Clark""s UH model for transformation, exponential recession model for baseflow, and Muskingum model for channel routing. The parameters were calibrated using an optimization technique with trial and error method. Performance measures, such as NSE, RAR, and PBIAS, were adopted to aid in the calibration processes. The model performance for those methods was evaluated at Gangcheong station, which is the outlet of study site. Good accuracy in predicting runoff volume and peak flow, and peak time was obtained using the Scheme II and III, considering the initial loss, whereas Scheme I showed low reliability for storms. Scheme III did not show good matches between observed and simulated values for storms with multi peaks. Conclusively, Scheme II provided better results for both single and multi-peak storms.

It is good to have procedural control over this power. However, I would like to express a little variation of what Matthew Arnold said, “procedural justice is a very good horse to ride, but to ride somewhere.” The enactment of the Korean Administrative Procedures Act was not a democratic - civic motive, but a (neoliberal) internal and external capitalist motive to remove obstacles to capital accumulations.Through the rule of law, realizing fair, transparent and predictable administration is an idea and principle that can not be denied. The problem is that, thanks to these ideals and principles, capital has secured the power to control the administration of nation states. The effects and pressures on domestic law imposed by globalization and foreign law can not be regarded as phenomena only in the neoliberal era. It should be noted, however, that these influences and pressures are normative in the sense that they are normalized - not exceptional - under today's neoliberal state system.So now, we have to find a way to escape the neoliberal project of dismantling people's sovereignty through ‘the rule of law’, but how? Finding the answer to this question is not easy. But it is still a question to be raised. There is no answer other than democratic transformation of administrative procedure law."

The pictorial maps on folding screens from the late Joseon period serve as primary examples to discuss what the late Joseon screen paintings display, how the screens were produced, the ways in which Western knowledge and information have flown into Joseon via China, and a transformation that foreign images have underwent after the introduction.The manuscript copies from the late Joseon period embrace a variety of animal motifs or sea-vessels depicted through Western pictorial techniques such as shading, cross-hatching, or foreshortening. The copies of the world maps in color illustrate the ways in which the screen maps were produced and reproduced onto the format of traditional folding screens, not to mention the way painter of the Royal Bureau of Painting in late Joseon dynasty understood and introduced the Western techniques. This study will attribute iconographic origins of figural motifs in the maps to a body of illustrated books of zoology or geography, maps, Chinese traditional encyclopedia, and other diverse materials that Jesuit missionaries consulted. Comparing diverse visual sources, the discussion will expand to examine the formation, development, and transformation of the animal motifs from the standpoint of cultural exchange and confluence between the East and the West. In turn, the comparative approach will speak to the interchange and fusion of knowledge and ideas as well as to the adoption of pictorial techniques, motifs, and styles. The last issue in this essay is that the transformation, in which the western maps to hang on walls or to be printed in a book have changed into a screen format of large size in the late Joseon period, should be considered in relation to the Korean tradition that a large-scale pictorial map had often featured a big folding screen. The academic attention to the format invites a socio-cultural analysis on historical function and aspects of the screen-formatted maps from the period, providing important clues as to understanding distinctive Korean qualities and transfiguration of the colored manuscript of world maps."

So Various experiments have been conducted to respond flexibly to the diversification of consumption models as well as innovative Webtoon Platform Industry.In the process, we attempted to derive the mentoring model for webtoon artists and preliminary artists as well, and suggested and/or evaluated mentoring between mentees and mentors according to the characteristics of each module and the type of consumer readers.Through this process of experiments and evaluations, selection and transformation, innovation and evolution, this study is designed to identify the mechanism by which the customized presentation of mentoring necessary for webtoon preliminary artists should be designed, and the evaluation index required for such design and application process. Variables and analytical topics raise the question of which metrics should be designed. In order to solve the proposed research problem, we analyze the manpower pool, the necessary elements of each module necessary for the webtoon industry ecosystem, the necessary ability of the evolving task, and the mentoring factors and periods of each field, the necessary competencies and supporting factors, and the path and way of continuous mentoring.The traditional concept of mentoring apprentice system has been to strengthen the humanistic relationship by filling the whole process of creation with time such as experience and repetition, imitation and creation based on the relationship between the artist and the preliminary artist. However, the analyzed paradigm of webtoon artists' mentoring requires staged, differentiated and three-dimensional mentoring movements during the mentorjng period based on the macro perceptions of the webtoon industry ecosystem. It suggests that it should be realized by the evolution of practical mentoring by various mentoring member and professional programs by time and season for creative process."

Shen-Kang protects against tacrolimus-induced renal injury,2019,"['Tacrolimus', 'Shen-Kang', 'Transforming growth factor beta1', 'Apoptosis', 'Oxidative stress']",,"Background/Aims: Evidence suggests that Shen-Kang (SK), a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, protects against various types of renal injury. In this study, we evaluated whether SK treatment confers renoprotection in a rat model of chronic tacrolimus (TAC) nephropathy.Methods: Rats were treated daily with TAC (1.5 mg/kg, subcutaneously) and SK (450 mg/kg, intravenously) for 4 weeks. The effects of SK on TAC-induced renal injury were assessed by measuring renal function, urine albumin excretion, histopathology, inflammatory cell infiltration, expression of profibrotic (transforming growth factor β1 [TGF-β1] and TGF-β inducible gene-h3 [βig-h3]) and proinflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, and apoptotic cell death.Results: Administration of SK preserved glomerular integrity (fractional mesangial area and Wilms tumor 1-positive glomeruli), attenuated tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and reduced the number of ectodermal dysplasia 1-positive cells, and this was paralleled by improved urine albumin excretion and renal dysfunction. At the molecular level, SK treatment suppressed expression of TGF-β1/Smad2/3, βig-h3, and proinflammatory cytokines. Oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death were significantly decreased with SK treatment, and apoptosis-related genes were regulated toward cell survival (active caspase-3 and the B-cell lymphoma-2/ Bcl2-associated X [Bcl-2/Bax] ratio).Conclusions: SK protects against TAC-induced renal injury."

Due to the high reputation of JSM in the discipline of sport management, the previous studies also looked into the topics of the studies in JSM. Although previous studies classified the topics using only titles, key words, and/or abstracts, the current study used the whole text of the research using topic modeling of a text mining technique. The current study used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA) algorithm of the tm package of R program. The PDF files of the 367 studies were downloaded from the electronic database and transformed into a text file of ANSI format. The reference list of each text file was erased manually due to its possible influence on the results. After a total of 10 topics were retrieved, a list of studies was assorted based on their Gamma scores. The assorted list of studies was sent to three-panel experts who had published studies through JSM. A panel of three experts agreed on the naming of topics and the topics are (1) sponsorship and endorsement, (2) studies on sport organizations, (3) diversity management, (4) role conflict, (5) sport event & tourism, (6) professional sports, (7) governance in sport, (8) consumer behavior, (9) studies on sport management and social impact of mega-sport event, (10) sport service and satisfaction. It was found that these 10 classified topics had different structures from the previous studies. It is true that the sub-disciplines of sport management do exist as the previous studies had shown. However it was empirically confirmed though topic modeling that the JSM articles did not reflect some sub-disciplines(e.g., sport finance, organizational behavior, sport law, etc.) as a main area of the sport management studies."

This study determines the ranking of the Russian oil services market at the global level. We employ expert assessments to identify relevant factors and indicators for evaluating competitive advantages in the oilfield industry. Using additive design and Saaty’s hierarchy analysis method, we determine the hierarchical structure of the factors influencing the development of oil services on the overall level of competitiveness of the oil services market. Using the integral analysis method, we develop a universal model for assessing competitiveness in the oilfield industry. Application of the model reveals that Russia ranked eighth among its main global competitors in 2017, and ranked ninth in terms of development growth rates for the period from 2007 to 2017. Practical implementation of the proposed measures can help monitor and address the major detrimental factors (i.e., decline in investments, high taxation, primitive technology, and high proportion of foreign service providers) affecting the development of Russia’s oilfield services market, the elimination of which may raise Russia’s status as an energy leader."

Unbalanced Growth in a Small Economy with Open Capital Markets,2019,"['capital account liberalization', 'structural transformation', 'Baumol’s disease', 'Balassa-Samuelson effect', 'trade imbalance']",,"This paper shows that in an economy with open capital markets, there exists a force toward unbalanced growth driven by intertemporal substitution of consumption and trade imbalance. We construct a two-sector Ramsey economy composed of a technologically progressive tradable sector and a technologically stagnant nontradable sector. We show that a capital account liberalization in the economy will drive the long-run share of the tradable sector toward one or zero, depending on whether the autarky interest rate is higher or lower than the world interest rate. The difference between the autarky interest rate and the world interest rate ultimately dictates the direction of structural transformation regardless of the progression of the Baumol’s disease that pushes up the relative price and the share of nontradables. Because the autarky interest rate is increasing in the rate of technological progress, our result suggests that cross-country differences in the rate of technological progress may be an important factor in accounting for the diverse patterns of structural change in a financially integrated world."

A crucial part of the building permit process is the interpretation and transformation of natural language-based building regulation into a computer-readable and executable format. As other countries and their projects have developed a certain type of rule-translation methods, KBimCode, part of the KBim application series, has been developed and supported by the Korean government to ignite an automatic, BIM-based building permit system on top of the current e-submission system, which is called Seumter. The rule translation process usually employs a computer hard-coded approach because of its ease of implementation, and there have been advances in making the computer understand the natural language-based building regulations using parametric input tables and script languages. This project includes a step for developing a logic rule-based approach for translating natural language into computer-executable code. However, the main contribution of this study is the introduction of an approach to represent such text-based regulations using visual language for novice programmers, architects, and rule reviewers. This paper describes a KBimCode visual language that is easy-to-write and intuitive because it uses visual symbols instead of textual coding."

Accordingly, the planned characteristics of the housing units in the U.S. since the 1980s are: 1) rational planning of the dayroom and the cell, 2) efficient surveillance and working style, 3) natural lighting, 4) sharing of programs between the housing units. In particular, the State of Tennessee has been chosen as a research example because of its recognition for the need for facility reform since the 1980s and developed a prototype model through its own research and efforts.Therefore, in this study, the architectural planning characteristics of the U.S. housing unit were summarized more closely through the analysis of the medium-security level housing unit in Tennessee. Based on these analyses, the study compared and contrasted the status of domestic correctional facilities and examined the direction to be considered in future planning. When compared to the U.S., problems with domestic correctional facilities can be raised such as uniformity in the form of the housing unit, a lack of shared space and natural lighting, inefficient surveillance systems, and a lack of connectivity between functions. Therefore, the lessons learned from the U.S. case analysis are proposed to be adapted and applied to the situation in Korea. The details are as follows: 1) development of a prototype with a shared space plan and direct supervision system, 2) introduction of a team system, 3) planning considering the interconnection between functions."

First, ten dynamical systems were structured to have state attractors with strictly imaginary conjugate pairs of eigenvalues; these were then mapped one-to-one on the reconstruction space. Second, the isometry characteristics defined as the change in the distance between two arbitrary points on the state trajectory before and after transformation were calculated for 2,000 cases with and without observation noise. Results showed that the isometry characteristics were not changed significantly with the level of observation noise, suggesting that the phase space reconstruction method could possibly be applied to analyze biomechanical data, regardless of the existence of a certain level of noise."

However, on the other hand, Japan before the Second World War rushed to become a colonial power under the slogan of ‘rich nation and strong army,’ and after the Second World War was affected by the negative effects produced by modernization such as pollution, nuclear plant accidents, and international antagonisms resulting from the competition for resources. However, these problems are not only faced by Japan all nations that have developed along the lines of the Western model of modernization. Considering this ‘negative legacy,’ this paper looked back on the theory of modernization adopted by Japan after the Second World War, and outlined the formation and change of the theory of development from within the country as proposed by Tsurumi Kazuko (鶴見和子; 1918~2006). Tsurumi Kazuko uncovered new meanings of identity based on solidarity and coexistence through investigation of Japanese folklore and by confronting the severe health problems caused by industrial pollution.

Improving Reaction-Diffusion Based Tone Representation using Discontinuity Information,2019,"['Reaction-Diffusion', 'Stylistic Rendering', 'Non-Photorealistic Rendering', 'Hedcut', 'Stippling', 'Hatching']",,"Representation of continuous tones using a response-diffusion model is a technique using pattern formation of morphogens. Grayscale images can be converted into images with discrete brightness using a mathematical model of morphogenetic material. This method allows the image to be converted into dots and lines, which can be used to render images in various styles. This is based on the assumption that the brightness information of the image is transformed into form-forming material and produces a predictable result when simulated. In actual experiments, the assumptions are good for the video signal that does not change rapidly, but the result shows the artifact in the result image for the rapidly changing part. This is shown in the form of black lines in the part where the brightness difference is rapidly changed, and this part may be different from the signal of the original image. In order to solve this problem, this paper attempts to solve the problem by deriving a method to solve the problem in the reaction-diffusion model and suggesting a new calculation method. The proposed method solves this problem by detecting the part where the brightness changes abruptly and controlling it so that diffusion does not occur in this part."

Therefore, this study analyzed the basic assumption that the excessive use of the Internet acts as a cause of experiencing the expression of disgust, and eventually it will be transformed into a perpetrator.As a step toward achieving the goal of this study, we first ascertain whether excessive use of the Internet affects the experience of Hate speech. Second, I sought to make sure that the perception of freedom of expression, which has been crucially discussed in expressing disgust until now, is a very important factor. Third, I want to analyze this part because I want to confirm whether offline abomination expression is going to be done until the offense of offline abomination expression occurs.As a result of analysis, excessive internet use was the cause of increasing frequency of disgusting experience. Also, as the experience of disgusting expression increased, experience of online abomination was increased, and it was confirmed that the experience of offline abhorrence was increased by this route. Especially noteworthy is the fact that the experience of the abomination and the freedom of expression are not influenced by the increase of the offline abomination expression affects, and it is confirmed that it influences through the online Hate Speech experience."

Depending on the robustness of the system, the DeFac method can guarantee the stability of the transfer power and efficiency of an ICPT system within a certain range of resistive-capacitive or resistive-inductive loads. A MATLAB-Simulink model of a ICPT system was built to assess the system’s main evaluation criteria, namely its maximum power ratio (PR) and efficiency, in terms of different approaches. In addition, a magnetic field simulation model was built using Ansoft to specify the leakage flux and current density. Simulation results show that both the maximum PR and efficiency of the ICPT system can reach almost 70% despite the severe detuning imposed by the DeFac method. The system also exhibited low levels of leakage flux and a high current density. Experimental results confirmed the validity and feasibility of an ICPT system using DeFac-designed parameters."

In this paper, we propose the method of separating the dynamic RCS of each target from the received signal by the Hough transform which extracts straight lines from the image. The micro motion of the targets was implemented using a 3D CAD model of the warhead and decoys. Then, we calculated the dynamic RCS from the 3D CAD model having micromotion and verified the performance by applying the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed method can separate the signals of the warhead and decoys at the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 10㏈."

The reason why such a low independency is based on difference of each nation's energy dependency. Germany as the largest economy in the EU has only a bundent coal resources. Given the IEA statistics, German energy independency accounts only for 37 percent including nuclear powers. It is much lower than the average of the EU's energy independency. Since the 1980s Germany has been keen to develop renewable energy resources due to the environmental problems. As a result, Germany could produce 33.1 percent of electricity with renewable resources in 2017 and plan to increase upto 35 percent in 2020.Furthermore, German government targets to produce 80 percent of electricity with renewable energy resources in 2050.

Conventional methods of using mathematical models have been found to be inaccurate due to the complexity of industrial mechanical systems and the existence of nonlinear factors such as noise. Therefore, any fault diagnosis issue can be treated as a pattern recognition problem. We propose an automatic fault diagnosis method using discrete wavelet transform and power spectrum density using multi pattern recognition. First, we perform DWT-based filtering analysis for noise cancelling and effective feature extraction. Next, the power spectral density(PSD) is performed on each subband of the DWT in order to effectively extract feature vectors of sound. Finally, each PSD data is extracted with the features of the classifier using multi pattern recognition. The results show that the proposed method can not only be used effectively to detect faults as well as apply to various automatic diagnosis system based on sound."
Reform Strategies of Vietnam in the 1980s and 1990s and Lessons for DPRK’s Economic Reform,2019,"['State Own Enterprises', 'Doi Moi', 'Structural Transformations', 'Foreign Direct Investment', 'North Korea']",,"This paper attempts to examine the strategies of economic reform in Vietnam, and underline limitations, including a lack of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and inefficient State Owned Enterprises (SOEs), on the process of the economic reform between the 1980s and 1990s. With China, Vietnam has been evaluated as a successful transition state since the late 1980s. The purpose of this paper is to gain lessons from the analysis of Vietnam’s economic reform model in the early age. With the Six Plenum of the Fourth Party Congress in 1979, Vietnam prepared economic reforms, with the “Contract system” and “three-plan system” adopted to repair the post-war economy. Moreover, the success of the first reform stage, Doi Moi (renovation) contributed to structural transformations that occurred throughout the late 1980s. However, economic reform did not continue to work in the early 1990s, and Vietnam accelerated the speed of reform since the Asian financial crisis. Despite significant high annual growth rate, Vietnam is still one of the 40 poorest states. This paper argues that the primary limitations of the economic reform in Vietnam between the 1980s and 1990 are a lack of FDI and incomplete reform of SOEs. It concludes with encouragements for North Korea to focus on denuclearization and diplomatic normalization with the US."

Can the performance of the BPSK modulation be better that that of itself? It is not normal. It should be clearly understood theoretically, with the ultimate bound, i.e., the channel capacity. This paper proves that the channel capacity of the O NOMA strong channel user is non-zero with zero power allocation.

This study aims to experimentally validate the blind source separation using ICA method and propose a novel method for identification of the modal parameters from the decomposed modal responses. The result of the experimental testing on the three-story steel scale model shows that the mode shapes obtained by ICA method are in good agreement with those by the analytical and peak-picking method in the frequency domain. Based on the robust mathematical model, ICA can calculate the natural frequency and damping ratio effectively using the probability distribution function of the instantaneous natural frequency determined by Hilbert transform of the decomposed modal responses and the change in the output covariance. Finally, the validity of the proposed method paves the way for more effective output-only modal identification for assessment of existing steel-concrete buildings."

In this regard, the present study aims to provide a framework for the design process of people management systems (PMS). We utilize critical realism as a metatheoretical framework and employ a principle-based approach rather than a strategy-based one. Critical realism refutes empirical realism, which is based on modernism, and social constructionism, which takes antirealism based on postmodernism. The principle-based approach differs from the strategy-based approach, which emphasizes the alignment of people management with business strategy. We propose a 5P5C model for this study. First, the 5Ps are five vital factors in the design and implementation of PMS and represent person, perspective, principle, practice, and performance. These five vital factors denote five stages in the design and establishment process of PMS. In this research, we explain the importance of and present relevant arguments for each 5Ps factor. Specifically, we highlight the importance of the “person” factor, which denotes every member of an organization at each level of a hierarchy. On the one hand, we regard a person as a subject and a proactive agent who transforms an existing institution. On the other hand, a person is also considered as an object who is influenced by an institution. Second, the 5Cs represent five connecting factors and denote community (between people and other vital factors), conceptualization (between perspective and principle), configuration (between principle and practice), congruence (between practice and performance), and capacity for change (between performance and other vital factors). These connecting factors likewise represent the potential outcomes of leading vital factors and the essential conditions for lagging vital factors. For example, configuration (a connecting factor) is the outcome of principle (a leading vital factor) and the essential condition for the adoption of practice (a lagging vital factor). We explain each vital and connecting factor with theoretical concepts and derive a few theoretical and practical implications. Theoretical contributions are twofold. First, we use critical realism as a metatheoretical framework to reveal the reality of people management clearly. Second, we emply the agency-structure framework to emphasize the essential being and role of a person in a firm. Furthermore, two issues are discussed, namely, the relationship between people and institutions and the difference between the principle- and strategy-based approaches."
Evaluation of Yield Components from Transgenic Soybean Overexpressing Chromatin Architecture-Controlling ATPG8 and ATPG10 Genes,2019,"['Soybean', 'Chromatin architecture', 'ATPG8', 'ATPG10', 'Agrobacterium-mediated transformation', 'High-yield']",,"AT-hook proteins are known to co-regulate transcription of genes through the modification of chromatin architecture. In plants, many genes encoding AT-hook proteins have been shown to be associated with increased seed yield or delayed senescence. In this study, we produced transgenic soybean plants overexpressing chromatin architecture-controlling ATPG8 and ATPG10 genes by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and examined their agronomic traits to identify the yield increase in soybean crop similar to those seen in model plants, Arabidopsis. A total of 16 (3 of pB2GW7.0-ATPG8 and 13 of pCSEN-ATPG10 transformed) transgenic soybean plants were produced and their T<sub>1</sub> seeds were harvested. Healthy and well-grown transgenic lines were selected (lines #1 and #2 from pB2GW7.0-ATPG8, and lines #8 and #9 from pCSEN-ATPG10), and the insertion and transcription level of genes were confirmed by PCR and RT-PCR with expected size. Investigation on agricultural traits confirms the increase in yield, plant height, the number of pods, and total seed weight with statistical significance when compared to wild-type soybean plants. The yield component study suggested that overexpression of ATPG8 and ATPG10 genes conferred positive effect on yield in transgenic soybean."

I analyzed the theory of eum, yang, ki and blood metabolism, yang transforming ki and eum forming the body on Korean medicine, and compared them with energy homeostasis by anabolism and catabolism of modern medicine. In the eum and yang theory, the metabolic process of the human body is dominated by synergism and antagonism between eum force and yang force. When the balance of eum and yang collapses, all the pathological actions of the human body appear, and in the eum and yang metabolic process, an imbalance between yang transforming ki and eum forming the body occurs. The function of yang transforming ki is reduced to ki deficiency, and the function of eum forming the body is increased to blood excess. When blood excess and ki deficiency is given, energy intake increases, energy expenditure decreases, overweight and obesity occur. On the contrary, the function of yang transforming ki is increased to ki excess, and the function of eum forming the body is decreased to blood deficiency. When ki excess and blood deficiency is done, energy intake decreases and energy expenditure increases, the body becomes leanness. When the balance of eum, yang, ki and blood metabolism collapses and becomes blood excess and ki deficiency, overweight and obesity occur, and when ki excess and blood deficiency is done, the body becomes leanness. The energy homeostasis of the human body can be explained by eum, yang, ki and blood metabolism of Korean medicine and it contains the concept of anabolism and catabolism of modern medicine."
Reform Strategies of Vietnam in the 1980s and 1990s and Lessons for DPRK’s Economic Reform,2019,"['State Own Enterprises', 'Doi Moi', 'Structural Transformations', 'Foreign Direct Investment', 'North Korea']",,"This paper attempts to examine the strategies of economic reform in Vietnam, and underline limitations, including a lack of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and inefficient State Owned Enterprises (SOEs), on the process of the economic reform between the 1980s and 1990s. With China, Vietnam has been evaluated as a successful transition state since the late 1980s. The purpose of this paper is to gain lessons from the analysis of Vietnam’s economic reform model in the early age. With the Six Plenum of the Fourth Party Congress in 1979, Vietnam prepared economic reforms, with the “Contract system” and “three-plan system” adopted to repair the post-war economy. Moreover, the success of the first reform stage, Doi Moi (renovation) contributed to structural transformations that occurred throughout the late 1980s. However, economic reform did not continue to work in the early 1990s, and Vietnam accelerated the speed of reform since the Asian financial crisis. Despite significant high annual growth rate, Vietnam is still one of the 40 poorest states. This paper argues that the primary limitations of the economic reform in Vietnam between the 1980s and 1990 are a lack of FDI and incomplete reform of SOEs. It concludes with encouragements for North Korea to focus on denuclearization and diplomatic normalization with the US."

The STFT analysis was performed with pressure data in the chamber to exhibit the appearance of frequency components at instant time. The STFT results indicate resonant frequencies of signal through their amplitudes. DMD analysis was conducted with the planar pressure data to extract the resonant frequencies and damping coefficients of acoustic modes. The damping coefficient is a parameter to evaluate the stability of a certain pressure oscillation in a dynamic system. By combining the results of STFT and DMD, the appearance of the resonant frequencies causing unstable combustion can be determined."

First, linear dynamical systems (N = 10) were designed to have state attractors. Second, 5,000 pairs of arbitrary points on the state response were randomly selected, and then transformed into a delay-coordinate map using phase space reconstruction. Third, changes in the Euclidean distance between two arbitrary points were comparatively observed before and after phase space reconstruction. The results showed that far points remained far from each other even after phase space reconstruction, while the distance between near points can become closer or further apart. The results help provide a qualitative understanding of the mapping constraints of phase space reconstruction as one of the mapping characteristics."

Various concepts in early Confucianism, such as that of “giving rise to life without ceasing” in the Yijing, or that of “forming the self and forming others” and “transforming heaven and earth through participating and assisting in their generative processes” found in the Zhongyong reflect the view of human and natural nature as connected to the fostering of life, or in Confucian parlance, ren or benevolence. The goal of humans is to realize their true nature of 'benevolence', and 'benevolence' is realized through the process of formation of the self and the other, which result in the salvation not only of human lives but also of all other beings in the ecosphere. Even if Confucian ethics does not specifically address modern conceptions of ecological or environmental issues, its reinterpretation in the context of contemporary ecological crisis has significance in the present. The Zhongyong and the Yijing take recourse to the model of family community when seeking to account for the natural world. In this communal model, not only humans but also all life in the natural world are regarded as equal progenies of heaven. According to this vision, rather than exploiting each other or living in confrontation, each member of the community should have its own status and role in the cosmic family community and be faithful in their respective roles to contribute to the prosperity and development of the entire community.These reflections have recently taken place in many Christian church communities, including the Catholic Church. Pope Francis’ encyclical Laudato Si’, which was promulgated on June 18, 2015, reviews the crisis facing modern earth that affects all living creatures including humans. The encyclical points out that humans in modern society are indiscriminately plundering nature, forgetting that they are a part of an intrinsic cycle in the cosmic community, and calls for the resolution of the crisis through spiritual reflection, based on respect for the mother earth and caring for all beings such as shown by St. Francis of Assisi. The encyclical stresses the need for fundamental change in human behavior, and urges us to realize that human nature is characterized not only by freedom but also by forming part and parcel of the universe as one of its generative components in a cosmic correlation. This is yet another philosophical and religious expression of the ecological vision contained in the Zhongyong, albeit from a different cultural background."
Passive Fault-tolerant Control Based on Weighted LPV Tube-MPC for Air-breathing Hypersonic Vehicles,2019,"['Air-breathing hypersonic vehicle', 'fault-tolerant control', 'LPV', 'model predictive control', 'tube']",,"This paper proposes a novel passive fault-tolerant control method using weighted tube-based model predictive control (Tube-MPC) via polytopic linear parameter varying (LPV) for air-breathing hypersonic vehicles. Firstly, the longitudinal LPV model of the vehicle is established by the Jacobi linearization and tensor-product (TP). The random drift fault or loss of efficiency fault over the elevator deflection is transformed equivalently into the additional item as bounded disturbance. Based on invariant set theory, a weighted Tube-MPC control method is proposed. In traditional Tube-MPC controller design, the worst case of the fault is generally considered. In order to balance control performance and robustness of the control system, this paper introduces a weighted strategy, where the weighted factor α is used to change the robust positive invariant (RPI) set for incomplete fault set. The robustness of the system is sacrificed, so that the invariant set can be reduced to expand the domain of the nominal control input. In this way, the control performance of the nominal system can be improved. In the actual flight, the states of the hypersonic vehicle system cannot be measured completely, and therefore a polytopic Luenberger state observer is developed to estimate the unmeasured states. The control errors and estimate errors are limited by two incomplete disturbance minimum RPI (idmRPI) sets. Finally, simulations verify the fault-tolerant ability and tradeoff regulating ability of the designed control system."

Based on the research of Jupiter, the modeling characteristics of Jupiter's surface was extracted, combined with different types and rhythmic beauty of lines, and linked from the perspective of design factor classification and analysis. Based on the modeling process, new clothing designs were carried out. The results of the study are as follows: First of all, the line was one of the basic elements of the design, and its styling characteristics provide unlimited possibilities for design. Secondly, the characteristics of the rich lines of the clouds on the surface of Jupiter could be seen to contain a variety of visual and aesthetic features. Thirdly, the above-mentioned styling features are expressed in four sets of garments. The two-dimensional lines were transformed into three-dimensional images by combining the fabric and color matching, so as to better reinterpret the rhythmic beauty of lines on the surface of Jupiter.Through the use of natural shapes and images as the expression elements of clothing, endowed with artistic significance, it can also develop into an original clothing design with high added value. A variety of natural images from multiple perspectives will be analyzed, and fashion research with new expression methods will be continued to achieve in the future."

On the learning machine with compensatory aggregation based neurons in quaternionic domain,2019,['Quaternionic multi-layer perceptron Quaternionic back-propagation 3D transformation Time series prediction'],,"The nonlinear spatial grouping process of synapses is one of the fascinating methodologies for neuro-computing researchers to achieve the computational power of a neuron. Generally, researchers use neu-ron models that are based on summation (linear), product (linear) or radial basis (nonlinear) aggregation for the processing of synapses, to construct multi-layered feed-forward neural networks, but all these neuron models and their corresponding neural networks have their advantages or disadvantages. The multi-layered network generally uses for accomplishing the global approximation of input–output map-ping but sometimes getting stuck into local minima, while the nonlinear radial basis function (RBF) net-work is based on exponentially decaying that uses for local approximation to input–output mapping. Their advantages and disadvantages motivated to design two new artiﬁcial neuron models based on com-pensatory aggregation functions in the quaternionic domain. The net internal potentials of these neuron models are developed with the compositions of basic summation (linear) and radial basis (nonlinear) operations on quaternionic-valued input signals. The neuron models based on these aggregation func-tions ensure faster convergence, better training, and prediction accuracy. The learning and generalization capabilities of these neurons are veriﬁed through various three-dimensional transformations and time series predictions as benchmark problems."

Furthermore, to suppress over-voltage and over-current during resonance, a novel method using a virtual harmonic resistor is proposed. The virtual harmonic resistor emulates the role of a resistor connected in series with the commutating inductor without influencing the active and reactive power control.

Since the size of the drone is much smaller than that of the conventional aircraft, it is difficult to detect by using the conventional detection method. Therefore, a detection method utilizing the Doppler characteristic generated by the rotating blades of the drone has been proposed. There is the STFT(Short Time Fourier Transform) method  as a representative detection method using the Doppler characteristic. The STFT method has a disadvantage that a long calculation time is required because of a process of accumulating signals repeatedly. In this paper, to overcome disadvantages of STFT method, the cepstrum method is applied to detect the rotating blades. First, we model the radar cross-section of the rotating blades and then apply the cepstrum method on the received signal of the radar including the Doppler characteristic. Finally, from the simulation results for the performance evaluation, we can see that, in the cepstrum method, it is easily verified the rotating blades of a drone by comparing the threshold and we can find the information of the rotating speed."

The microstructural characteristics of spot weld jointsand LME cracking tendency were investigated using dye penetration tests, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopytogether with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. It was found that as the electrode force increases, the crack size decreasesdue to a fast increase in crack tip temperature which rises further with more holding time up to 800 ms in high temperaturezone. Least amount of crack size was observed at 5 kN electrode force and 400 ms of welding time. Finally, the experimentalresults have also been simulated by finite element modeling (FEM) to find suitable mechanism of crack formation, and acombination of 4 kN and 400 ms was suggested for the crack free and less thermal deformation in the spot welded TRIP steel."

In order to meet the diverse needs of the people for dispute resolution, the innovation and development of online arbitration is timely. Internet arbitration focuses on Internet business disputes and integrates the comprehensive use of electronic technology, big data, and cloud computing on the Internet platform to provide parties with convenient and efficient dispute resolution services. As a result, the “quantity” diversion of dispute cases is promoted, and the “quality” improvement of dispute resolution is realized. However, the promotion of Internet arbitration in China is not universal. It faces many obstacles, such as lack of arbitration consciousness, credit concepts and so on. The key to removing obstacles lies in the strong guarantee of law and the optimization of practical operation. Based on this, on the one hand, it is necessary to unify and perfect the overall framework of Internet arbitration through legislation, including perfecting the supporting legal system, establishing the online trust stamp system, and ensuring the service and enforcement of Internet arbitration awards. On the other hand, we need science and technology to help online platform systems and a flexible use of big data to handle case data, while standardizing the industry personnel and enhancing public awareness of arbitration. Only in this way can we effectively guarantee the effectiveness of the Internet arbitration system and promote the information development of the online arbitration institutions and the new dispute resolution mechanism."

The experimental results show that this 3D laser radar can accomplish the 3D object scanning and the environment 3D reconstruction task. In addition, the experiment result proves that the product of the camera focal length and the baseline length is the key factor to influence measurement accuracy."

The Camera Obscura and Nineteenth-century Optics: The Shifting Ideals of Manliness in Dickens’s Dombey and Son,2019,"['Charles Dickens', 'Dombey and Son', 'the camera obscura', 'nineteenth-century optics', 'masculinity', 'male gaze']",,"This paper explores how Charles Dickens’s Dombey and Son (1848) demonstrates the connection between the transformation of masculinity and the changes in the notions of vision and the observer in the early nineteenth century by focusing on its three male characters: Paul Dombey, James Carker, and Dombey’s son called little Paul. From his original status as a Cartesian subject, which is established in Dickens’s use of camera obscura images for him, Dombey degenerates into a being-as-object who is stupefied into passivity and lethargy after losing his controlling patriarchal power. I scrutinize how Dombey’s downfall is associated with the collapse of the camera obscura model of vision and subjectivity. I read Carker― e.g. his failed attempt to use his versatility and sharp eyes to subvert and steal Dombey’s social and economic power―through a changed meaning of the camera obscura in The German Ideology (1845-46) by Marx and Engels as a degenerative metaphor for procedures and forces that conceal, invert, and distort ideologies. Little Paul’s awareness of his subjectivity as being-as-object, which exists only in front of the other-as-subject, can be read as a precursor to the twentieth-century discourse on the reorganization of the visual relationship between subject and object and the decentralization of the subject-as-observer’s ruling position by Sartre. However, the early death of Paul Jr. implies that he fails to provide an alternative model of reciprocal male gazer/subject."

Effects of tranilast on the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in peritoneal mesothelial cells,2019,"['Epithelial-mesenchymal transition', 'Fibrosis', 'Peritoneal dialysis', 'Peritoneum', 'Tranilast']",,"Background: We investigated the effects of tranilast on epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in an animal model and on the EMT signaling pathway in human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs).Methods: We performed in vitro studies (cytotoxicity, cell morphology, and western blot analyses) on HPMCs from human omenta, along with in vivo studies (peritoneal membrane function and morphometric and immunohistochemical analyses) on Sprague Dawley rats. Thirty-two rats were divided into three groups: control (C) group (peritoneal dialysis [PD] catheter but not infused with dialysate), PD group (4.25% glucose-containing dialysate), and PD + tranilast group (4.25% glucose-containing dialysate along with tranilast).Results: In in vitro experiments, transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) increased α-smooth muscle actin and Snail expression and reduced E-cadherin expression in HPMCs. TGF-β1 also reduced cell contact, induced a fibroblastoid morphology, and increased phosphorylation of Akt, Smad2, and Smad3 in HPMCs. Tranilast significantly inhibited TGF-β1-induced EMT and attenuated these morphological changes in HPMCs. In in vivo studies, after 6 weeks of experimental PD, the peritoneal membrane was significantly thicker in the PD group than in the C group. Tranilast protected against PD-induced glucose mass transfer change and histopathological changes in rats.Conclusion: Tranilast prevented EMT both in HPMCs triggered with TGF-β1 and in rats with PD-induced peritoneal fibrosis. Thus, tranilast may be considered a therapeutic intervention that enables long-term PD by regulating TGF-β1 signaling pathways."

In addition, it turns out that infectious disease outbreaks and political events such as the SARS and THAAD placement are also important factors for foreign tourists, when they determines to visit Busan. Therefore, for the tourism industry in Busan to have a greater economic impact, tourism policy should aim not only to make it have a higher correlation with other domestic industries, but also to transform it into a more value-added and labor intensive service industry. In particular, to increase the economic effects of foreign tourists, it is also necessary to make efforts to make Busan a safer and more comfortable tourist spot with more accommodation capacity."

By simplifying the tension flange of the steel beam using a steel plate in tension, the solutions obtained for the stress intensity factors of the double-edged cracked steel plate strengthened with CFRP plates were used to evaluate those of the steel beam specimens. The correction factor <i>α</i><sub>1</sub> was modified based on the transformed section method, and an additional correction factor <i>φ</i> was introduced into the expressions. Threedimensional FE modeling was conducted to calculate the stress intensity factors. Numerous combinations of the specimen geometry, crack length, CFRP thickness and Young's modulus, adhesive thickness and shear modulus were analyzed. The numerical results were used to investigate the variations in the stress intensity factor and the additional correction factor <i>φ</i>. The proposed expressions are a function of applied stress, crack length, the ratio between the crack length and half the width of the tension flange, the stiffness ratio between the CFRP plate and tension flange, adhesive shear modulus and thickness. Finally, the proposed expressions were verified by comparing the theoretical and numerical results."
A Weibull Distribution Based Technique for Downscaling of Climatic Wind Field,2019,['Statistical downscaling .Weibull parameters .Wind direction .Wind components . Quantile mapping'],,"This study proposes a simple approach based on Weibull distribution parameters for downscaling climatic wind speed and direction. In this method, the Weibull parameters of a Global Climate Model (GCM) are modified using Weibull parameters of the reference data (ECMWF). To correct the wind direction, the downscaling technique was applied to the eastward and northward wind components. All the wind components were simply transformed to positive values in order to fit a Weibull distribution. The unbiased wind speed was calculated by integrating the corrected wind components. Moreover, other models were considered to directly modify the wind speed (not wind components) using the same methodology. Performance and ability of the proposed approach were evaluated against the existing statistical downscaling techniques such as Multiplicative Shift Method (MSM), quantile mapping and support vector regression. In the models, the 6-h GCM wind component/speed was the sole predictor and the ECMWFreanalysis wind data was considered as the predictand. It is demonstrated that direct application of the proposed method on the wind speed slightly gives better estimation of the predictand rather than its application on wind components. The results indicate theWeibull distribution based method outperforms the other techniques for wind direction and magnitude. The method provides sound predictions for a wide range of wind speed from low to high values. By using the proposed downscaling technique for wind components, wind direction can be adjusted accordingly."
A receding contact analysis for an elastic layer reinforced with a functionally graded coating and pressed against a half-plane,2019,"['Receding contact mechanics', 'Functionally graded coating', 'Singular integral equation', 'Finite element analysis', 'Stress analysis']",,"We aim to analyze the receding contact mechanics of an elastic layer reinforced by a functionally graded coating, pressed against a half-plane substrate as an integral assembly. The graded reinforcement is modeled by an inhomogeneous medium whose shear modulus is allowed to vary exponentially. A smooth receding contact is arisen due to the normal tractions applied over a finite segment of the reinforcement surface. The primary goal of this study is the determination of both the receding contact pressure and the extent of receding contact along the assembly and substrate interface. Using both an analytical and a finite element method solves the problem. In the former approach, Fourier integral transforms help convert the problem into a singular integral equation of Cauchy type, which is numerically integrated with Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature. In the numerical approach, multiple homogeneous layers approximate the graded coating. The stresses at those nodes lying on sublayer interfaces are averaged over their surrounding elements for guaranteeing the continuity in stress field. Very good agreements are found between the results obtained from the two methods. Extensive parametric case studies reveal that material properties, loading configuration, and geometric parameters all play important roles in the determination of both the contact pressure distribution and the length of contact. These receding contact properties can therefore be optimized as desired by appropriately varying the influential parameters. Both the solution methodologies and the numerical results presented in this work can provide some useful guidelines on the better design of multilayered functionally graded structures."

However, protectionism in developed countries intensified around 2017, and the so-called trade war between US and China since 2018 negatively affected open economies including Korea. For Korea, the two powers constitute the top trade partners. Korea is one of the few countries in the world who concluded free trade agreements (FTAs) with the two powers. Korea can be situated jammed between the two powers geopolitically and geo-economically, but this particular odd situation comes from the inescapable trade dependence of the Korean economy. The real lesson from trade openness should be supplemented by an additional condition of diversification. This should be applied to Mexico, Chile, and other trading nations in Latin America. Furthermore, given the Chinese aggressive inroads in the region during the US disengagement, most Latin American countries will face lots of challenges coming from the rivalry between US and China, and can draw implications from the Korean experiences."

Lastly, current status of health laws were compared using the health system six building blocks model proposed by the WHO in 2007.Before the division of South and North Korea, the Joseon Medical Ordinance was based on health policy implementation in the Japanese colonial era and U.S. military administration. South Korea enacted various health laws by using the Joseon Medical Ordinance until 1951. The Framework Act on Health and Medical Services enacted in 2000 to strengthen consistency and interconnection of various health laws. North Korea didn't admit Japanese colonial rules and they presented the ideology of a free socialistic healthcare in 1946 and subsequently enacted individual laws such as the People Health Act and Medical Service Act etc.The composition and comprehensiveness analysis of the health laws confirms that 40 out of 40 assessment items of the health laws exist in South Korea and 36 in North Korea, with both having relatively diverse areas of health laws. However, North Korea is expected to need to supplement bills related to non-communicable diseases, organ transplants, mental health, death and dying, oral health, and HIV/AIDS. In addition, analysis results confirmed that the health laws of North's Korea do not vary in the types of individual laws compared to South Korea and do not cover details.This study is meaningful because it can help gauge the ideology and direction of North Korea's health policy. Although many limitations exist, this research is expected to be important in establishing the basis for policy on public health of the Korean peninsula by comparing the composition and inclusiveness of the health laws in South and North Korea."

However, protectionism in developed countries intensified around 2017, and the so-called trade war between US and China since 2018 negatively affected open economies including Korea. For Korea, the two powers constitute the top trade partners. Korea is one of the few countries in the world who concluded free trade agreements (FTAs) with the two powers. Korea can be situated jammed between the two powers geopolitically and geo-economically, but this particular odd situation comes from the inescapable trade dependence of the Korean economy. The real lesson from trade openness should be supplemented by an additional condition of diversification. This should be applied to Mexico, Chile, and other trading nations in Latin America. Furthermore, given the Chinese aggressive inroads in the region during the US disengagement, most Latin American countries will face lots of challenges coming from the rivalry between US and China, and can draw implications from the Korean experiences."

This article starts with the research idea that family violence experience bring about negative emotion in terms of interpersonal relationship leading to the distribution of negative affect in social relationship. The research question of this study pinpoints on how family violence experience affects interpersonal relationship problems and how spirituality affects interpersonal relations problems. Based on the idea, we attempts to deal with spirituality’s impact as a driving factor of transforming the distribution of negative affect.Research design, data, and methodology – The structural equation modelling(SEM) is employed as a analysis method of this study. SEM provides a chiefly cross-sectional statistical modelling method, and moreover it allows multiple variables to be associated with a latent variable in this analysis. 300 samples from Seoul, Gyeonggy and Gangwon are selected in the survey. We chose available 271 among them.Results – The results verify that trauma have placed an negative impact on personal relations. The study results also shows that the more serious get the degree of family violence trauma, the worse become interpersonal relationship problems. What is more interesting is that the degree of trauma’s impact on interpersonal relation problems in male is higher than that of trauma’s impact in female. It is mainly attributed to the fact that women are superior to men in terms of empathy ability and interpersonal relationship orientation. It can be noted that the well-managed spirituality will be able to make a great contribution towards reducing the degree of trauma caused by interpersonal relationships.Conclusions – The study results demonstrates that family violence have negative impacts on spirituality, while spirituality have an positive impacts on reduction the problems of interpersonal relationship. It has been found out that family violence trauma may cause negative affectivity in personal relations, which can distribute negative impacts regarding interpersonal relationship in society. This study also supports that spirituality will be able to function well as a helper, which may reduce the distribution of negative affect in society."

Our analysis was conducted by using a large-sampled data from the 2016 Korean Civil Service Survey (KCSS) of which respondents were 2,069 central and local government officers in 42 South Korean central agencies and 17 local governments. This study found that between-group variance for organizational commitment is significantly different from zero (i.e., cluster effects in the data), indicating the need for HLM; and both individual level physical factors―such as payment, promotion and work environment―and organizational level human relations factors―transformational leadership and consensus culture―have significant positive effects on organizational commitment. According to our analysis, 63.04 percent of the between-group variance in organizational commitment was explained by human relations factors. The theoretical and practical implications of this study is as followed. First, it is theoretically meaningful in that this study revalidated the meaning of Hawthorne studies complementing the limitations have been discussed in the previous studies. On the practical side, also, this study provided policy implications for improving organizational commitment by proving the importance of the organizational level relational supports in addition to that of physical supports which have drawn great interest in the previous studies; as well as showed the possibility of application of Hawthorne studies in Korean public sector."

제의와 드라마 사이: 바라카의 『노예』 읽기,2019,"['ritual drama', 'The Slave', 'Imamu Amiri Baraka', 'African-American theatre', 'black revolutionary theatre']",,"Ritual is discerned not as religion alone, but as a pattern conceived for the purpose of healing and rejuvenating a specific community. African-American artists facilitate the paradoxical process of refusing Western models through African ritual, what really turns out to be a denial of, and reaction against, Euro-Western archetypes. Baraka adopts ritual characteristics in his drama, The Slave. He has every intention that his theatre may have an explicit social message to arouse audiences’ social awareness and move that audience to social action. What is characteristic and problematic in employing ritual elements in The Slave is that Baraka presents Walker’s journey of revolutionary war only to fail. Walker’s final transformation at the end of the play is an old negro slave. His transformation process is retrospective and backward to the past slavery era. The failure of a protagonist in The Slave might foretell that of a playwright, Baraka, who tried to wade through the polluted history and immature community of the African-Americans in the 1960s."

Based on the theoretical consideration of educational constructivism and pedagogical implication of flipped learning, the main purpose of this paper is to examine how team and task-based learning environment influences the improvement of 35 university EFL students’ TOEIC scores. In order to accomplish this goal, this study adopts a new learning method with more focus on creativity and team-collaboration, called Creative Learning by Doing(CLD). After accomplishing a prerequisite online program that studies various reading passages, students merge an extensive amount of reading and TOEIC-making information with their peers and a teacher, then make TOEIC questions and answers by themselves. Through an in-depth analysis of students’ pre-post test score and various factors that affect their learning process both quantitatively and qualitatively, the result of this study shows that CLD-based learning has a positive influence on increasing students’ TOEIC score regardless of their previous proficiency level. Specifically, the analysis of a sentence structure and reading ability is more crucial for achievement than merely memorizing the meaning of vocabulary. Furthermore, in a transition from the traditional approach that mostly dwells in lecture-based instruction, participants transform learning into student-centered and active learning process and create synergies based on diverse characteristics and different perspectives of other peers. Based on the findings, this paper further highlights how to create active and meaningful learning environments where students can be navigators of their own education, which serves as the corner stone for successful leaner-centered education."

This essay examines Shaw's reinvention of Pygmalion the mythic sculptor as Higgins, a phonetic scientist. While what is central to Pygmalion's interaction with his creation is the male artist's erotic romanticization of a passive statue-woman, which is fundamentally motivated by some artistic 'feeling,' the essay argues Higgins' characterization as the deemotionalized ""energetic scientific type...careless about himself and other people including their feelings"" serves to undo the emotional foundation making up the romanticized mythic artist. Shaw ultimately deromanticizes and deeroticizes Pygmalion's romantic and erotic dynamic with Galatea which is quintessentially amorous and private, rewriting it as the socially driven modern project of a scientist ""to take a human being and change her into a quite different human being by creating a new speech for her"" for the purpose of ""filling up the deepest gulf that separates class from class and soul from soul."""
Time-Varying Formation Tracking for Multiple UAVs with Nonholonomic Constraints and Input Quantization via Adaptive Backstepping Control,2019,"['Formation tracking', 'Multi-UAV system', 'Nonholonomic constraints', 'Input quantization', 'Adaptive backstepping control']",,"An adaptive control approach is presented for time-varying formation control of multiple UAVs with nonholonomic constraints and input quantization. The UAVs are described by nonholonomic kinematic model and autopilot model with uncertainties. A transverse function is designed to release the nonholonomic constraints. To avoid chattering, an enhanced hysteretic quantizer is utilized to process the input signals. The quantized signals are analyzed by a new decomposition method to release some restrictions. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, the adaptive backstepping controller is proposed for the formation tracking of multiple UAVs. Tuning functions are devised to make estimations of the unknown parameters and disturbances. A transformation function is applied to the control inputs to eliminate quantization effect. Stability analysis proves that the tracking errors can converge to the origin asymptotically, and all the signals in the closed-loop system are globally bounded. A simulation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Based on the control approach, the multi-UAV system can track the reference trajectory while forming and maintaining the predefined formation shape."

This is because the analytical methods based on statistics and machine learning need to the structured data. The structured data has a matrix mainly consisting of rows (documents, observations) and columns (words, variables). The value of each cell in this matrix is the occurred frequency value of a word in a document. Typically, zero inflated problem occurs during this process. This problem is that the ratio of zero values in all data values is too large. The zero inflated problem reduces the explanatory power of the analytical model and thus lowers the accuracy of the prediction.

As a result of their interests, the number of Christian churches, which have begun to follow the liturgies of the early Christian church have been increasing. Even, some of the Korean Protestant church denominations have renewed their Sacraments based on the rites of Christian initiation and Eucharist shaped in the third to fourth century. For this reason, these churches also have been interested in how the early church had educated the Sacraments, and had trained their baptismal candidates during the preparation period for baptism. The Christian churches in the fourth to fifth century, especially, taught the newly baptized and their congregations the holy Sacraments and their meanings within the form of preaching known as mystagogy, which means preaching about holy sacramental mystery. In this research, I probe the mystagogies of two key figures in the fourth and fifth century, John Chrysostom and Cyril of Jerusalem, who were called mystagogues, the preachers of the sacramental mystery. I also deal with how Chrysostom and Cyril taught the Sacraments, which is called ‘mysterion,’ to the newly baptized through their mystagogies. Through this research, I have arrived at a conviction as following: Chrysostom understood that the Sacraments enable the Christian lives to aim at the moral and eschatological dimension while Cyril assured that the Sacraments as imitation of Christ make the Christians transform ontologically into the dimension of likeness of Christ. To reach this conclusion, I probed the precedent researches regarding this topic by both domestic and foreign scholars, first. Then, I researched each of two scholars‘ mystagogy focused on the order of the rite of Christian initiation, theological meanings and interpretations, and methodologies they used to explain the sacramental mystery. Finally, I suggest my conclusion of this research, analyzing two mystagogies, and discuss to apply this conclusion to the ministry field of the Korean Christian church, today."

It is necessary not to accumulate knowledge, but to transform education and parenting to wisdom of insight into life, communication, and empathy. Therefore, we sought to find the important value of infant education in the traditional parenting and education principle that have placed importance on human nature. 'Yangahlok' is the only parenting diary of a noble family in the Choseon Dynasty written by Lee Moon-gun, Mook-jae. Mook-jae practiced education for family succession by fostering his grandson's personality with a child care perspective that focused on protection, moderation and personality. The contents of infant education can be divided into health and safety, basic living habits, and learning, and the methods of education were modeling, practicing, and erasing. The principal parent's role is as a guide to helping build the right personality of the infant with consistent attitudes and perceptions that remain relevant. Mook-jae presents the goals of parenting and education: fostering an intelligent person who preserves human goodness and achieving personal training. The implications of Mook-jae's teaching for early childhood education are as follows: setting the goal of education to completion of personality, teaching temperance to control infant's speech, behavior, emotions and thoughts, emphasizing the principle of education in accordance with knowledge and action, and providing time for reflection."

Today’s Korean churches, however, do not adequately address contemporary situations in which women are encouraged to actively participate in the Korean society. Based on this awareness, this study attempts to show how Christian women, especially educated women, mothers of educated women, Bible women, and women missionaries, played active and cooperative roles in women's education during the early modern period(1885-1920). Their collegial relationships formed a solidarity between women missionaries and educated women, between mothers who supported daughters for their education and educated women, and between women missionaries and Bible women. This solidarity was built by moving beyond traditional hierarchical relationships between teachers and students, between mothers and daughters, and between missionaries and helpers. One historical example is that of the Bible women who taught illiterate women how to read and write the Korean language while they evangelized them. Another is that of education at the girl's academy where women missionaries, senior and junior students lived together and shared faith. These collegial relationships and solidarity made an important impact on Christian women's education in the early Modern period and can provide us with a good educational model in which women today may be encouraged and challenged to achieve their own identity in close relation to other Christian women. This study of early modern Christian women and Christian women’s education can impact Christian education today. Christian education for the 21st century needs to include women's experiences as educational content and to embrace diverse experiences of marginalized people. Christian education also needs to provide an educational environment in which students are encouraged to become ""better Koreans and better Christians,"" based on cooperating with one another rather than on competing for success."

As a result, private banks have accumulated large amounts of money and banks` asset structures have changed significantly. Being difficult to achieve these goals, BOJ has gradually expanding the easing scale, by applying negative interest rates and adopting a technique to control the yield curve. Non-traditional monetary policies aimed at quantity have returned to traditional monetary policies aimed at interest rates.  On the other hand, capital investment and consumption do not increase easily. As banks cannot manage the operation of large excess reserves, it seems that the financial intermediation of banks’ traditional business model is changing. After the collapse of the bubble economy in Japan, the manufacturing-centered industrial structure has been required to change. Banks may also be required to change their structure due to the QQE.  In the post-war growth economy, Japanese banks have loaned abundant household savings to corporations and the government. Since the 1990s, as household savings decreased and corporate savings increased, banks have loaned abundant corporate savings to the government through the purchase of government bonds, and BOJ has purchased the bonds. We can find such changes in the financial intermediary structure in changes in banks` asset structures."

Among them, fashion designs using generation algorithms began to appear in the mid-2000s. Among generation algorithms, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a method that produces plausible samples as generation models and discriminant models competitively trained. In this paper, style transfer methods were used to create Hanbok images based on contour images of Hanbok with GAN algorithm. Style transfer is a suitable way to create hanbok with a variety of designs but no large changes of shape. In this paper, we built our own color and contour images of hanbok dataset for applying style transfer. After that, we analyzed methods and results of design using DiscoGAN, CycleGAN, and Muint, which are representative style transfer methods. As a result, all three methods learned the transformation between the color domain and the contour domain to create a new hanbok image given the contour image. In addition to the basic hanbok design, it designed creative hanbok with new patterns and color changing tie. This paper demonstrates that it is possible to design hanbok using artificial intelligence and future development possibilities."

As a result, a total of 72 checklists were developed into three questions for Inseong Deokmok, a sub-section of the four types of leadership, and 22 mid-level managers who were field experts were given content addition plans. Studies show that the contents of affirmation, confidence and patience in subtype of the followership leadership are very high, and the modesty content is rather low. In the self-leadership subtype, the content of challenge, persistence was shown very high, and the content of imagination, honesty and courage appeared rather low. The content of forgiveness and allocation appeared rather low, although it was generally high in the subtypes of the servant leadership. The content of order and self-restraint appeared rather low, although it was high in the transformation leadership subtype. However, items of the subtype contents, which were somewhat lower, were also higher than the criterion of judgement (.42), so all of them could be considered reasonable. These findings could be used as a basis for the mid-level manager's personality leadership program development study."
Mechanical Properties of Multiscale Graphene Oxide/Basalt Fiber/Epoxy Composites,2019,"['Multiscale composites', 'Basalt fiber', 'Graphene oxide', 'Silane functionalization', 'Mechanical properties']",,"This work was carried out to study the effects of silane functionalization of graphene oxide (GO) nanoplatelets and their loadings on the mechanical properties of basalt fiber (BF)/epoxy composites.

The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and thermal gravimetric analysis(TGA) results demonstrated that silane compound can be covalently grafted to the surface of GO. The multiscale silanized graphene oxide (SGO)/BF/epoxy composites with various weight percentages of SGO in the matrix (0-0.5 wt.% in the step of 0.1) were fabricated. According to the experimental data, the 0.4 wt.% SGO-filled composite showed the maximum improvement by 18 %, 59 %, and 61 % in the tensile, flexural and compressive strengths of BF/epoxy composite, while the maximum improvement by 46 %, 54 %, and 66 % in the tensile, flexural and compressive moduli, respectively was observed for the 0.5 wt.% SGO-filled composite. Additionally, the SGO was more effective in mechanical property enhancement of fibrous composites in comparison with GO, due to its silane-functionalization. From the fracture surface examination of the specimens, it was found that the incorporation of GO or SGO improved the BF-epoxy interfacial bonding. A theoretical model based on Euler-Bernoulli beam-based method was utilized to predict the compressive properties of composites, which was in an excellent agreement with the experimental data."

Based on a model of the CD basis weight profile, a system non-square interaction matrix with high dimensionality was analyzed by experimental studies and numerical computation. Along the diagonal of the interaction matrix, the matrix block method was adopted to reduce the system dimensions and convert it into a square system. The multivariable control system with high dimensionality is divided into several subsystems. According to the structure of each subsystem, a new constraint on the control variables was introduced to satisfy the triangular decomposition of the subsystem. Based on the multi-actuator parallel control strategy, the correlation between the subsystems was eliminated, and a high-dimensional multivariable decoupling control problem was transformed into a group single loop control general problem. The relative gain matrix of the new system was calculated to verify the decoupling effect in theory, and the real-time performance of the technique was demonstrated by results from an implementation on an actual project of a paper mill."

The results indicated that the sulfur groups were successfully introduced onto the surface of the baker’s yeast and participated in the adsorption processes.The kinetic and isotherm data showed good correlations with the pseudo-second-order model and the Langmuir model, respectively. The equilibrium time and the maximum values obtained from the two models were 40 min, 239.8mg/g for Cd2+ and 300 min, 64.45mg/g for MB, respectively. The thermodynamic analysis (G<0, H>0, S>0) demonstrated that the adsorption processes of Cd2+ and MB onto the XMBY were endothermic and spontaneous. In the binary-component solution (Cd2+ and MB), the adsorption capacity for MB was almost unaffected by the presence of Cd2+ and interestingly, the adsorption capacity for Cd2+ increased in the presence of MB. Overall, these results indicated that XMBY could be a promising adsorbent for the treatment of wastewater containing both Cd2+ and MB."
SMA-based devices: insight across recent proposals toward  civil engineering applications,2019,"['devices', 'fatigue', 'hysteresis cycles', 'passive and semi-active control', 'shape memory alloy']",,"Metallic shape memory alloys present fascinating physical properties such as their super-elastic behavior in austenite phase, which can be exploited for providing a structure with both a self-centering capability and an increased ductility. More or less accurate numerical models have been introduced to model their behavior along the last 25 years. This is the reason for which the literature is rich of suggestions/proposals on how to implement this material in devices for passive and semi-active control. Nevertheless, the thermo-mechanical coupling characterizing the first-order martensite phase transformation process results in several macroscopic features affecting the alloy performance. In particular, the effects of day-night and winter-summer temperature excursions require special attention. This aspect might imply that the deployment of some devices should be restricted to indoor solutions. A further aspect is the dependence of the behavior from the geometry one adopts. Two fundamental lacks of symmetry should also be carefully considered when implementing a SMA-based application: the behavior in tension is different from that in compression, and the heating is easy and fast whereas the cooling is not. This manuscript focuses on the passive devices recently proposed in the literature for civil engineering applications.

The general belief at the time was that in order to transform into liberal democracies, these countries must immediately adopt and develop democracy and the rule of law. Transitional justice is concerned with how a state dedicated to the rule of law comes to terms with the lawlessness of a prior government, without in the process infringing on its own commitment to legality and impartiality. However, a number of tensions exist between them, primarily with regards to their respective functions of empowering and limiting government.At the time of democratic reforms, an important debate surfaced questions of culpability for crimes committed by former Communist regimes. Options ranged from providing amnesty or pardon, prosecuting individuals, or outlawing the Communist Party. Indeed, many of the newly constituted governments reacted swiftly by outlawing the Party, prosecuting anyone deemed to have had connections to the Party or the Secret Police, or restricting those individuals from certain government and non-government posts. Lustration laws, though controversial, remain the most commonly used device for screening and prosecuting former Communist leaders, candidates for office, and selected public employees. These laws, which generally rely on information contained in Secret Police files, are used to determine whether suspected individuals collaborated with the former state security service. But in emerging democracies, the rule of law is essential to establishing the foundations for democracy.This article, therefore, draws on historical, comparative, and structural analyses of processes of democratization in Poland and Hungary, including the problem of transitional justice, in order to evaluate the lustration law that has better fulfilled its expectations. The Poland and Hungary are chosen because both countries deal with the similar legacy of the communist regimes and are influenced by quite political circumstances in their transition to democracy. As a result, since they have developed distinctive models of lustration laws, processes of democratization in Poland and Hungary will likely be played out in Korea."
Tracking Control of Hypersonic Vehicles with Input Saturation Based on Fast Terminal Sliding Mode,2019,"['Hypersonic vehicle', 'Input saturation', 'Tracking control', 'Sliding mode control']",,"In this paper, the track problem of hypersonic vehicle is studied and analyzed with external disturbances, parameter uncertainty and input saturation. First, to make the design of controller convenient, the input and output linearized high-order model of hypersonic vehicle is transformed into a multi-variable second-order system model by introducing auxiliary error variables. To ensure the sliding mode manifold is practical finite time stable, an adaptive fast nonsingular terminal sliding mode controller is designed for hypersonic vehicle with unknown upper bound of disturbance. An adaptive anti-saturation fast nonsingular terminal sliding mode controller is designed by introducing hyperbolic tangent function an auxiliary system, which further solves the input saturation problem. Not only the requirement for actuator physical restraint is satisfied, but also the finite time stability of system sliding mode manifold is guaranteed at the same time. The vigorous proof is given using Lyapunov theory for the designed controllers. The numerical simulations are also conducted with the longitudinal nonlinear dynamic mode of hypersonic vehicle. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the two designed controllers."
Removal of Cr(VI) from aqueous solution using amine-impregnated crab shells in the batch process,2019,['Crab shells Modification Cr(VI) ions Adsorption Amine group'],,"To increase adsorption capacity of Cr(VI) ions in aqueous solution, crab shells was chemically modified bymeans of copolymerization method using tri-ethyl amine and epichlorohydrine. Functional groups ofchemically modified adsorbents were analyzed by Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) and surfacecondition was confirmed by the SEM (scanning electron microscopy) and EDX (energy dispersive X-ray).It was found that the amino, amide and hydroxyl groups play an important role in adsorption of Cr(VI)ions. The adsorption capacity for Cr(VI) ions of the amine-impregnated crab shells was about 36.865 mg/g-dry mass and higher than that of virgin adsorbents (16.564 mg/g-dry mass) at initial solution pH 2.0.Langmuir and Freundlich models were used tofit the equilibrium data and the Langmuir isotherm modelwellfit the data. The maximum adsorption capacity (qm) for Cr(VI) ions was calculated as the 41.412 mg/g-dry mass. Also, the pseudo-second-order kinetic model wellfit the experimental data better than thatof the pseudo-first-order. In addition, the adsorption capacity of Cr(VI) decreased as the temperaturerose, indicating the exothermic nature of the adsorption process. Furthermore, adsorption capacity of Cr(VI) for reused amine-impregnated crab shells can be still maintained at 33.653 mg/g level until the 2ndcycle. It was concluded that the adsorption process using amine-impregnated crab shells could be appliedto the removal system of Cr(VI) ions from aqueous solution and it could sufficiently replace thecommercial ion-exchange resins."

The task time window and the power consumption of multi-robot (driving distance) are regarded as the utility function and the maximized utility function is the objective function. Then an integer programming formulation is constructed considering the number of task assignment on an agent according to their battery consumption restriction. The problem of task allocation is solved by table working method. Finally, simulation modeling of the methods based on table working method is carried out. Results show that the method has good performance and can improve the efficiency of the task execution."

Among them, fashion designs using generation algorithms began to appear in the mid-2000s. Among generation algorithms, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a method that produces plausible samples as generation models and discriminant models competitively trained. In this paper, style transfer methods were used to create Hanbok images based on contour images of Hanbok with GAN algorithm. Style transfer is a suitable way to create hanbok with a variety of designs but no large changes of shape. In this paper, we built our own color and contour images of hanbok dataset for applying style transfer. After that, we analyzed methods and results of design using DiscoGAN, CycleGAN, and Muint, which are representative style transfer methods. As a result, all three methods learned the transformation between the color domain and the contour domain to create a new hanbok image given the contour image. In addition to the basic hanbok design, it designed creative hanbok with new patterns and color changing tie. This paper demonstrates that it is possible to design hanbok using artificial intelligence and future development possibilities."

630 nm-OLED Accelerates Wound Healing in Mice Via Regulation of Cytokine Release and Genes Expression of Growth Factors,2019,"['Light-emitting diode', 'Organic light-emitting', 'Photobiomodulation', 'Wound healing']",,"hotobiomodulation (PBM) using organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) surface light sources have recently been claimed to be the next generation of PBM light sources. However, the differences between light emitting diodes (LEDs) and OLED mechanisms in vitro and in vivo have not been well studied.In vivo mouse models were used to investigate the effects of OLED irradiation on cellular function and cutaneous wound healing compared to LED irradiation. Mice in the LED- and OLED-irradiated groups were subjected to irradiation with 6 J/cm 2 LED and OLED (630 nm), respectively, for 14 days after wounding, and some mice were sacrificed for the experiments on days 3, 7, 10, and 14. To evaluate wound healing, we performed hematoxylin-eosin and Masson’s trichrome staining and quantified collagen density by computerized image analysis. The results showed that the size of the wound, collagen density, neo-epidermis thickness, number of new blood vessels, and number of fibroblasts and neutrophils was significantly influenced by LED and OLED irradiation. The tissue levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were investigated by immunohistochemical staining. LED and OLED irradiation resulted in a significant increase in the tissue IL-1β and IL-6 levels at the early stage of wound healing (P < 0.01), and a decrease in the tissue TNF-α level at all stages of wound healing (P < 0.05), compared to the no-treatment group. The expression levels of the genes encoding vascular endothelial growth factor and transforming growth factor-beta 1 were significantly increased in LED and OLED-irradiated wound tissue at the early stage of wound healing (P < 0.01) compared to the no-treatment group. Thus, OLED as well as LED irradiation accelerated wound healing by modulating the synthesis of anti-inflammatory cytokines and the expression levels of genes encoding growth factors, promoting collagen regeneration and reducing scarring. In conclusion, this suggests the possibility of OLED as a new light source to overcome the limitations of existing PBMs."

Bio-oil can be transformed into high-quality syngas through the gasification process, which has a smallamount of impurities. The bio-oil gasification process consists of the injection of bio-oil, atomization of the injected biooil,vaporization of atomized bio-oil droplets, and a gasification reaction by mixing the vaporized bio-oil and air. Theperformance of the nozzle plays a very important role in determining the efficiency of the entire gasification system.Although there are many studies on the direct gasification of biomass, studies of bio-oil gasification are very rare. Inorder to study bio-oil gasification, the injection characteristics of bio-oil using a twin fluid nozzle should occur. Therefore,in this paper, a twin fluid nozzle was modeled and the injection characteristics of bio-oil in the reactor were analyzedby using CFD. Specifically, an entrained flow type reactor was applied and the injection flow characteristics werecalculated and analyzed with respect to the air flow rate."

Mostly, edit scripts which are produced as the results of diff on tree-structured documents only consist of basic operations such as update, insert, delete. However, when move and copy are included in edit scripts, because of the characteristics of their complex operation, it is often that edit scripts are generated to execute in two passes.

Currently, KEPCO is conducting a pilot project aimed at spreading power planner nationwide by 2020, but there are undergoing delays due to various difficulties. Typical problems include low consumer value perception and lack of understanding about the service. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed that the factors affecting perceived value of Smart Meter(power planner) provided in the form of app or web service, using the Contingent Valuation Method(CVM) and regression analysis. The study derived five independent variables(usefulness, convenience, reliability, eco-friendliness, security) from previous studies of technology acceptance and Smart Grid, IoT Smart Home Service, and Home Energy Management system. The research model and hypotheses were set up to examine the effect of each variable on perceived value(willingness to pay) of smart meter services.

Kinetics of nitrification and acrylamide biodegradation by Enterobacter aerogenes and mixed culture bacteria in sequencing batch reactor wastewater treatment systems,2019,"['Acrylamide biodegradation', 'Ammonia inhibition', 'Biodegradation kinetics', 'Enterobacter aerogenes']",,"This study evaluated the kinetics of acrylamide (AM) biodegradation by mixed culture bacteria and Enterobacter aerogenes (E. aerogenes) in sequencing batch reactor (SBR) systems with AQUASIM and linear regression. The zero-order, first-order, and Monod kinetic models were used to evaluate the kinetic parameters of both autotrophic and heterotrophic nitrifications and both AM and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removals at different AM concentrations of 100, 200, 300, and 400 mg AM/L. The results revealed that both autotrophic and heterotrophic nitrifications and both AM and COD removals followed the Monod kinetics. High AM loadings resulted in the transformation of Monod kinetics to the first-order reaction for AM and COD removals as the results of the compositions of mixed substrates and the inhibition of the free ammonia nitrogen (FAN). The kinetic parameters indicated that E. aerogenes degraded AM and COD at higher rates than mixed culture bacteria. The FAN from the AM biodegradation increased both heterotrophic and autotrophic nitrification rates at the AM concentrations of 100-300 mg AM/L. At higher AM concentrations, the FAN accumulated in the SBR system inhibited the autotrophic nitrification of mixed culture bacteria. The accumulation of intracellular polyphosphate caused the heterotrophic nitrification of E. aerogenes to follow the first-order approximation."

At first, this article discusses the post-Doi Moi political economy in Vietnam. From the adoption of Doi Moi in 1986 by the CPV’s Sixth National Congress to present day, Vietnam’s economy has transformed from a centrally planned model to market oriented with four characterized sub-periods. I divide the subperiods based on the economy’s entrepreneurial perspectives, emerging cultural values, the building of market economy, and attitude toward global geopolitics and economics. Secondly, this article explains the development of Vietnamese capitalism focused on the features of rent-seeking societies. Three analytical rent-seeking models are employed to assess three different industries: textile-garment and telecommunications, both under a state capitalist system with varying degrees of state control, and the motorcycle industry developed in a crony capitalist manner. Our cross-industry analyses demonstrate how a developing country such as Vietnam overcomes pervasive rent seeking to achieve growth outcomes. Under conditions of controlled economic reform, the Vietnamese government managed rent seeking using various measures of state intervention coupled with gradual market openness in the industrial sectors."

This article analyzes his scenarios Bulgeun Bang (1989) and Namhangang (1990) in the view of adaptation. Jang Sunwoo planned them as a model of realism of Korean society right after the June 1987 Uprising, but these works were thwarted in the pre-production stages due to external pressure. Bulgeun Bang pursues 'a film as a movement' revealing the contradictions of Korean military regime which put to torture on innocent people. Namhangang rewrites Korean modern history from the perspective of the people (minjung) from 1910s to the period of Liberation. By doing so, Jang Sunwoo has produced 1980s works that were full of transformational fervor across Korean history. This origin of Jang Sunwoo's film needs to be considered interpreting and evaluating his whole film world. This article also shows the feature of 1980s of Korean New Wave could be a more excessive one, so there must be considered a limitation of expression when we interpret and evaluate Korean New Wave cinema. In addition, this view highlights the homogeneity of Korean New Wave and the progressive film movement in the 1980s."

Early Christians have passed on their spiritual practices to contemporary Christians. Conscious involvement in the practices will provide contemporary people with valuable chances to experience self-transforming interactions with God and even union with God.The purpose of this study is to clarify the results of Teresa of Avila’s prayer of recollection as the empowerment of both intellect and will. As a doctor of the church who taught how to pray, Teresa presented prayer of recollection as an authentic way of prayer in her three books: The Book of Her Life (1562), The Way of Perfection (1566), and The Interior Castle (1577). She proposes prayer of recollection not only as her practical skill to pray but also as a sacred technique to reach God who dwells in the center of the human soul. Prayer of recollection has two components of its practice: recollecting human senses scattered in the external world and concentrating on the center of the human soul where God dwells.Jess Byron Hollenback’s synthetic model regarding the results of recollection shows that the result of Teresa’s prayer of recollection is the empowerment of human intellect and will. This empowerment significantly contributes to Teresa’s union with God by promoting the experience of God’s presence in the center of the human soul."

However, the advance also requires high computational complexity. To accelerate the intra prediction mode decision, a minimum risk Bayesian classification framework is introduced. The classifier selects a small number of candidate modes to be evaluated by a rate-distortion optimization process using the sum of absolute Hadamard transformed difference (SATD). Moreover, the proposed method provides a loss factor that is a good trade-off model between computational complexity and coding efficiency. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a 31.54% average reduction in the encoding run time with a negligible coding loss of 0.93% BD-rate relative to HEVC test model 16.6 for the Intra_Main common test condition."

The fracture surfaces of epoxy resin nanocomposites with different contents of GO and $SiO_2/GO$ were observed by a Scanning Electron Microscope(SEM). The mechanism for mechanical properties of epoxy resin nanocomposites was analyzed by modeling of nanocomposites with different GO and $SiO_2$ weights. Due to the GO, both the heat resistance and the glass transition temperature of the epoxy resin nanocomposites were improved. Interestingly, when 0.1 wt% of GO was added to the epoxy resin/hardener mixture, the mechanical properties increased compared to that of neat epoxy resin. There results were caused by an aggregation between the GO and $GO/SiO_2$. Based on the analysis of the mechanical properties of $SiO_2$ addition, buckling analysis was performed and the critical load and buckling shape were confirmed."
The Types and Management of Differentiating Consumption depends on the social class of Korean consumers,2019,"['Category Boundaries', 'Omnivorities', 'Heterogeneity', 'Diversity']",,"This paper presents two social and academic studies on the boundary between cultural production and consumption. The first line of the study on cultural omnivore analyzes the choice of heterogeneous audiences in the face of various cultural offerings. The second line is a study of market categories, which analyzes the responses of peer audiences to objects with different levels of category code compliance. As such, this paper developed a heterogeneous audience model to evaluate objects of different types. This allows us to consider two dimensions of cultural preference: diversity and orientation of selection. To this end, this paper proposes a new analytical frame work to map consumption behavior on these two dimensions. The results suggest that one type of target that values diversity and transformation is particularly resistant to those that span boundaries. We test this argument in the analysis of two large data sets on film and restaurant reviews. Overall, our findings can extend beyond cultural consumption. Outline variability of contextual individuals or individuals in the same situation can cross cultural boundaries even if they are not intentionally pursuing such hybridism."

Specifically, this study identifies two types of purposes of smart factory building as follows: (1) improving productivity, (2) increasing flexibility. In this study, three aspects of smart factory building contents were suggested like this: (1) automation area (facility automation vs. work automation), (2) big data system focus (radical transformation vs. incremental improvement), and (3) value chain integration area (internal value chain integration vs. external value chain integration). In addition, we looked at how firm size moderates the purposes - contents - continuous utilization of smart factory relationship. A questionnaire survey was conducted on 151 manufacturing companies. More specifically, out of 151 companies, 100 are small-and-medium-sized enterprises and 51 large-sized enterprises. All questionnaires were targeted at companies with Smart Factory level above level 2. The analysis results of this study using Smart PLS statistical programs are as follows. First, the purposes of smart factory building including increasing productivity and flexibility had positive impacts on all of the contents of smart factory building. Second, all of smart factory building contents had positive impacts on the continuous use of smart factory except big data system for incremental improvement of manufacturing process. Third, the impacts of smart factory building purposes implementation on smart factory building contents varied depending on whether the purpose is productivity improvement or flexibility. Fourth, it was founded that firm size moderated the relationships of purposes - contents - continuous utilization of smart factory in such a way that large-sized firms tend to empathize the link between flexibility and smart factory building contents for continuous use of smart factory, while small-and-medium-sized-firms emphasizing the link between productivity and smart factory building contents. Most of the previous studies have focused on presenting current smart factory deployment cases. However, it is believed that this research has made a theoretical contribution in this field in that it established and verified a research model for the smart factory building strategy. Based on the findings from a working-level perspective, corporate practitioners also need to have a different approach to smart factory building, which should be emphasized depending on whether their purpose of building smart factory is to increase productivity or flexibility. In particular, since the results of this study identify the moderating effect of firm size, it is deemed necessary for firms to implement a smart factory building strategy suitable for their firm size."

Phylogenetic tree was generated by the neighbor-joining method using program MEGA 7.0. Based on our previous transcriptomic data, the transcription levels were calculated by RSEM software and were clustered by ShortTime-series Expression Miner. The plant expression vector of CgNF-YB9 was constructed using In-Fusion Cloning and transferred into tobacco by leaf disc transformation method. Soluble sugars and gene expressions were analysis by HPLC and qRT-PCR, respectively.Results A total of 24 CgNF-Y genes (6 CgNF-YAs, 13 CgNF-YBs and 5 CgNF-YCs) were identified with conserved domains.Phylogenetic analysis of the NF-Y proteins indicated that NF-YA, NF-YB and NF-YC could be categorized into four, five and three clades, respectively. Expression profiling analysis reflected spatio-temporally distinct expression patterns for CgNF-Y genes. Importantly, we observed a positive correlation between the expression level of CgNF-YB9 and the content of soluble sugar. Moreover, CgNF-YB9-corelated genes were enriched in carbohydrate metabolism. In CgNF-YB9 overexpression lines, sucrose content showed a decrease, whereas glucose and fructose contents displayed an increase. As expected, the transcription levels of sucrose-phosphate synthase and vacuolar invertase in transgenic Line 3 were observed with significantly down- and up-regulated, respectively.Conclusions The structure, phylogenetic relationship and expression pattern of 24 CgNF-Y genes were identified, and CgNFYB9 was involved in sucrose metabolism."

Eco-friendly Grafting of Chitosan as a Biopolymer onto Wool Fabrics Using Horseradish Peroxidase,2019,"['Wool', 'Chitosan', 'Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)', 'Grafting modification', 'P-hydroxyphenylacetamide (PHAD)']",,"Chitosan and enzymes have been extensively used in modification of wool, due to their non-toxic and eco-friendly characteristics, as well as to reduce pollution in textile production. In the present work, chitosan was grafted onto wool fabrics using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in order to endow wool with outstanding properties. The reaction mechanism, grafting percentage, and properties of chitosan-grafted pretreated wool fabric including wettability, dyeability, shrink resistance, and antibacterial activity were studied. P-hydroxyphenylacetamide (PHAD), as a model compound for tyrosine residues in wool,was used to study the mechanism of HRP-mediated grafting of chitosan onto wool. UV and FTIR analyses indicated that quinones, which are intermediate of HRP/H2O2-catalyzed PHAD, reacted with the amino groups of chitosan by Schiff base or Michael addition reactions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that dichloroisocyanuric acid pretreatment had an etching effect and some substances were deposited onto the wool fiber. SEM and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy further confirmed the covalent grafting of chitosan onto wool. Compared with chitosan-grafted unpretreatedwool, there was an obvious improvement in grafting efficiency of chitosan onto wool fabric, physical and mechanical properties after pretreatment and chitosan grafting on the wool. For chitosan-grafted pretreated wool fabrics, there was no observable change in the thermal behavior, while the hydrophilicity, dyeability, shrinkage resistance, and antibacterial activity were remarkably improved compared to that of untreated wool. The present work offers a new ecologically acceptable process of grafting chitosan on the wool."

Under the influence of an electric field, shells were studied by filling them in glass cells coated with transparent ITO working as an electrode. CLC shells with a planar texture having dark brushes at 0 V under crossed polarizers transformed into a focal conic domain, a fingerprint texture, and finally to an isotropic phase with an increase of electric field that was confirmed by inserting the Bertrand lens in the polarized light path. In addition, our studies also show that the electric-field-driven isotropic phase was due to dielectric heating and local heating effects. The calculated magnitude of the local heating result from the model was in agreement with the experimental observation together with the chiral nematic to isotropic transition due to conventional heating."

The pooled proportion of technical failure and unreliable measurements was calculated using meta-analytic pooling via the random-effects model and inverse variance method for calculating weights. Subgroup analyses were performed to explore potential causes of heterogeneity. The pooled intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for interobserver and intraobserver reliability were calculated using the Hedges-Olkin method with Fisher’s Z transformation of the correlation coefficient.Results: The search yielded 34 articles. From 20 2D-SWE studies including 6196 patients, the pooled proportion of technical failure was 2.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3–3.9%). The pooled proportion of unreliable measurements from 20 studies including 6961 patients was 7.5% (95% CI, 4.7–11.7%). In the subgroup analyses, studies conducting more than three measurements showed fewer unreliable measurements than did those with three measurements or less, but no intergroup difference was found in technical failure. The pooled ICCs for interobserver reliability (from 10 studies including 517 patients) and intraobserver reliability (from 7 studies including 679 patients) were 0.87 (95% CI, 0.82–0.90) and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89–0.95), respectively, suggesting good to excellent reliability.Conclusion: 2D-SWE shows good technical performance for assessing liver stiffness, with high technical success and reliability. Future studies should establish the quality criteria and optimal number of measurements."

Despite the recent emphasis on creativity and sensitivity, school spaces have been designed uniformly for efficiency and control. Recently, discussions have been underway to design students’ customized spaces with students and teachers. In this way, an attempt is being made to transform future school spaces. We analyzed a “case of participatory school space design,” examined satisfaction with the result and efficiency of the project, and posed the research question, “How satisfied were design participants and general users?” (Method)First, the necessity of participatory space design is elucidated through previous research, and major examples of participatory space design project in Korea are analyzed. In this study, The case study is 'Making a happu school in 2014 culture'. Second, after that, analyze results of the project. The subjects were 'workshop participants (student, teacher)' who participated in the workshop 'Creating a Happy School in Culture 2014' and 'General beneficiary' who uses the space after completion. The survey method is largely evaluated by quantitative evaluation of the preceding factors and then analyzed using PCSI (Public-service Customer Satisfaction Index) user satisfaction analysis model which is commonly used in public institutions and public project satisfaction surveys. Through each evaluation, we analyze the evaluation of the business case and the significance by comparing the score of the project as a whole, the 'workshop participant' and the 'general beneficiary', and then the participatory space design suggests the direction that the project should have present. (Result)The PCSI of culture - happy school building was 85.6 points, and the confidence interval of the institutional score at the 95.0% confidence level was 83.1 ~ 88.0. Among the quality factors, 'process quality' and 'environmental quality' were the highest score of 85.9 and 'social quality' score was 80.1. Also, in all the evaluations, the score of 'workshop participants' was higher than that of 'general beneficiaries'. (Conclusion)The satisfaction of the school space improvement project through the participatory space design suggests that the space user participation process is needed more than the designer - led process in the future space design project. The process of public space design in the future will be necessary to collect and participate in user 's opinions. In the future, opportunities for users to participate in design with understanding and interest in space change through the process of collecting opinions from users in the process of designing public space such as schools and public offices, workshops on changes in space, and satisfaction surveys , Design satisfaction will be high and space design activation and cultural consciousness will spread."

The scope of the study analyzes the paradigm shift elements of the public design process by focusing on social design and urbanization as part of the perceptional transformation of public design according to the historical considerations of the generational design methodology, which is the center of the entire research context. Among the factors, we will analyze the case of public design combined with interactive design as a category of corporate shared value creation(CSV) concept and public design. A case analysis of public space design based on a common strategy of culture and information exchange among six large companies in Korea found that there is a common effect of creating shared value with the public, which promotes participation among users by providing a platform of communication to the public and enhancing corporate identity and image. It was confirmed that there is an effect of creating shared value with the public to promote participation among users. This effect can be seen as a virtuous cycle of sustainability, which encourages companies to invest in public design and increases corporate trust in the benefits of users. In order to integrate this CSV concept into public design, there are many factors, but as an alternative, it suggests the introduction of process element and process model of service design methodology. In addition to the above factors, in order to find an alternative paradigm orientation of the public design process, various public design elements, namely, eco-design, emotional design, ubiquitous design, universal design, crime prevention environment design, etc., are scattered. In order to implement this, it is considered that a platform-type counter is needed to find a touch point that can lead collaboration among stakeholders such as government, corporations and the private sector."

Effect of non-uniform fields on DNA entering nano-channel,2019,"['Crack', 'Gene sequencing', 'Molecular dynamics simulation', 'Nanochannel']",,"The translocation of deoxyribonucleic-acid (DNA) segments into a nanoscale channel from a bulk solution has significance to genome-related fields such as gene sequencing and genetic profiling. However, its dynamic characteristics are poorly understood because of complexities involving the size and character of the confining spaces, polymeric evolution, and driving sources. The DNA translocation was studied by mesoscale simulation using a worm-like-chain model of DNA and the dissipative particle dynamics method. Three driving sources — electric field, suction flow, and constant body force were individually applied to a λ-DNA entering a nanoscale cylindrical channel. Each source altered the translocation actions, mainly due to marked differences in conformational transformation processes. The suction flow uniquely induced strong extension of the DNA chain before channel entry. Consequently, the flow was more effective at overcoming the free-energy barrier with narrower confinements. Other driving sources permitted the DNA chain to enter in a more globular form, which was effective for larger entrances. Combining different sources is the most versatile means of controlling the translocation of genetic materials in highly confined spaces."

Adaptive Backstepping Control Design for Uncertain Non-smooth Strictfeedback Nonlinear Systems with Time-varying Delays,2019,"['Adaptive control', 'backstepping', 'non-smooth nonlinear systems', 'time-varying delays']",,"This paper is concerned with the problem of adaptive neural tracking control for uncertain non-smooth nonlinear time-delay systems with a class of lower triangular form. Based on Filippov’s theory, the bounded stability and asymptotic stability are extended to the ones for the considered systems, which provides the theory foundation for the subsequent adaptive control design. In the light of Cellina approximate selection theorem and smooth approximation theorem for Lipschitz functions, the system under investigation is first transformed into an equivalent system model, based on which, two types of controllers are designed by using adaptive neural network (NN) algorithm. The first designed controller can guarantee the system output to track a target signal with bounded error. In order to achieve asymptotic tracking performance, the other type of controller with proportional-integral(PI) compensator is then proposed. It is also noted that by exploring a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and designing proper controllers, the singularity problem frequently encountered in adaptive backstepping control methods developed for time-delay nonlinear systems with lower triangular form is avoided in our design approach. Finally, a numerical example is given to show the effectiveness of our proposed control schemes."

Methods: A multifarious network of Aedes aegypti is addressed keeping the viewpoint of a complex system and modelled as a network. The dengue network has been transformed into a one-mode network from a two-mode network by utilizing projection methods. Furthermore, three network features have been analyzed, the power-law, clustering coefficient, and network visualization. In addition, five methods have been applied to calculate the global clustering coefficient. Results: It has been observed that dengue epidemic follows a powerlaw, with the value of its exponent γ = –2.1. The value of the clustering coefficient is high for dengue cases, as weight of links.The minimum method showed the highest value among the methods used to calculate the coefficient. Network visualization showed the main areas. Moreover, the dengue situation did not remain the same throughout the observed period. Conclusions: The results showed that the network topology exhibits the features of a scale-free network instead of a random network.Focal hubs are highlighted and the critical period is found. Outcomes are important for the researchers, health officials, and policy makers who deal with arbovirus epidemic diseases.

In particular, due to the merit that a small number of people can acquire data at a rapid interval, various researches on UAV are being conducted. However, surveying of ground control points (GCP) is essential when producing orthophotos using UAV. In this study, geometric correction of the ortho-corrected target image without GCP was performed using the reference image. we matched the feature points of the two images using SURF method, and then performed the geometric correction using the Affine transform model estimated using the RANSAC method. The accuracy of the reference image was horizontal maximum error x=0.11m, y=0.15m and z=0.16m. And standard deviations were =0.07m, =0.09m and =0.10m. The accuracy of the image without geometric correction was the horizontal maximum error x=3.61m, y=3.85m. And standard deviations were =1.73m, =1.70m. Geometrically corrected image was horizontal maximum errors x=0.43m, y=0.43m and standard deviation were =0.19m, =0.18m. Through these results, we were able to determine the possibility of making orthophoto using the feature points of the reference image."
Dynamic characteristics and experimental study on a wind turbine gearbox,2019,"['Excitations', 'Wind turbine gearbox', 'Time-varying wind load', 'Dynamic response', 'Test analysis']",,"A gearbox is part of the transmission chain of wind turbine, which can increase rotational speed and reduce torque. Dynamic characteristics of the gearbox directly influence the vibration and the service life of the wind turbine system. In this paper, dynamic behaviors of a megawatt level wind turbine gearbox are studied theoretically and experimentally by dividing the gearbox into a transmission sub-system and a body sub-system. The transmission sub-system, i.e., the gear-shaft-bearing sub-system, is coupled with the gearbox body using bearings which are simulated as mass-less springs. The theoretical study applies a finite element model for the gearbox, where the internal excitations are caused by time-varying stiffness, transmission errors and mesh impacts. The time-varying wind load is considered as the external excitation, collected by a remote real-time online test and transformed into load spectrums through the rain-flow counting method. With boundary conditions and working conditions being defined in the finite element model, the natural characteristic analysis and the dynamic response analysis are conducted. Results show that the operating frequencies of the gearbox are far away from the main natural frequencies of the system, thus avoiding resonances. The main vibration components of the gearbox are with meshing frequencies of the second and third gear stage and their multiplication counterparts. Moreover, the greatest vibration occurs at the bearing housing of the high-speed shaft with the root-mean-square value of its vibration speed less than 3.5 mm/s. A test rig is developed and the experimental vibration conditions are monitored by acceleration sensors. The experimental results are in accordance well with the theoretical results.In this way, the theoretical model is validated. The methodology reported in this paper can provide valuable guidance for practical industrial engineers."
Inﬂuence of a hybrid digital toolset on the creative behaviors of designers in early-stage design,2019,['Early-stage design Digital design Computational design Architectural design Hybrid digital design systems Intelligent human-machine integration'],,"The purpose of this research was to investigate how diversiﬁcation of the repertoire of digital design tech-niques affects the creative behaviors of designers in the early design phases. The principal results of practice-based pilot experiments on the subject indicate three key properties of the hybrid digital tooling strategy. The strategy features intelligent human-machine integration, facilitating three different types of synergies between the designer and the digital media: human-dominated, machine-dominated, and a balanced human-machine collaboration. This strategy also boosts the cognitive behaviors of the designer by triggering divergent, transformative and convergent design activities and allowing for work on various abstraction levels. In addition, the strategy stimulates the explorative behaviors of the designer by encouraging the production of and interaction with a wide range of design representations, including physical and digital, dynamic and static objects. Thus, working with a broader range of digital modeling techniques can positively inﬂuence the creativity of designers in the early conception stages."
Improved Speed Sensorless Vector Control Algorithm of Induction Motor Based on Long Cable,2019,['Speed sensor-less vector control Long cable Electrical submersible pump (ESP) Inverter Induction motor (IM)'],,"In many applications, especially electrical submersible pump required remote operation of inverter via a long motor cable. The conventional control algorithm of induction motor (IM) didn’t operate effectively, which ignored the influence of the cable length, and didn’t consider the effect of long cable distribution parameters. A speed sensor technique was also difficult to achieve. In this paper, an improved speed sensorless vector control algorithm (ISSVCA) for IM based on long cable was proposed. Based on the analysis of long cable motor drive system of the inverter, the two-port π network model of the long cable was established. The functional relationship between the voltage/current parameters of the two ports of the long cable and the cable distribution parameters was deduced. The function expression was transformed to the α − β stationary reference frame, the accurate motor terminal voltage/current was calculated, so that the flux model was constructed to realize the observation of the flux, accurate velocity identification, and closed-loop control of the torque, flux and current. Simulation and experimental results showed that the proposed ISSVCA based on long cable increased the starting electromagnetic torque, decreased speed dip and speed recovery time caused by sudden loads, reduced the DC current harmonics, and had good dynamic and static characteristics."
Flawless Symbol or “Wet Blanket”: The Significance of Fanny Price in Jane Austen’s Mansfield Park,2019,"['Jane Austen', 'Mansfield Park', 'leadership', 'feminist', '18th century', 'Christianity']",,"Fanny Price, the protagonist of Jane Austen’s Mansfield Park, is enigmatic. While her humility is admirable, such passive and “flawless” characteristics are in sharp contrast to the less than perfect heroines in prior novels. Many have interpreted these personality traits to be an ideological manifesto, reflecting an attempt to support Anglican Evangelism. Others have argued that she is the embodiment of an Enlightenment feminist. Still others argue that Fanny is an insipid and vapid character, strictly adhering to rules like a wet blanket. This paper argues that Fanny is neither meant to be characterized as perfect nor flawed. Instead, she represents an ordinary woman who can transform society through good leadership. Her behaviors are not random, but reveal deliberate strategies to positively control the character flaw, which is externally represented by the social circle of Mansfield Park itself. Because Fanny provides very influential leadership while adhering to the social position in which she was placed, she serves as the ideal 18th-century British role model, a person who can work within the existing patriarchal system to bring about meaningful change."
The Strategy of the Process of Unification between South Korea and North Korea in Dissimilar Administrative and Political Theory,2019,"['Idealism', 'Realism', 'Socialist Market Economy', 'Unification']",,"The strategy of idealism rather than realism is required to deliver a peaceful solution on the Korean Peninsular. It is needed to understand the dissimilar ideas, theories, and cultures in South Korea and North Korea, which have affected the social, political, and cultural situation. If North Korea wishes to attain economic growth, as a matter of fact, it is requisite to adopt the strategy of socialist market economy, such as the case of China and Vietnam. It is beneficial and effective to apply in whole or part the reform model of China and Vietnam for North Korea, which will contribute to accomplish economic growth for North Korea and to arbitrate the extreme ideological difference between South Korea and North Korea. Strategic transformation and ideological understanding on the Korean Peninsular is essentially required to avoid extremely problematic and violent situation and circumstance. Four alternative unification scenarios described by Pollack & Lee can be explained as the course of the unification between South Korea and North Korea:“(1) integration and peaceful unification; (2) collapse and absorption; (3) unification through conflict; and (4) disequilibrium and potential external intervention.” It is prerequisite to alleviate the ideological difference between South Korea and North Korea for pursuing peaceful unification and integration as the adoption of idealism."

Throughout Islamic history, and especially since the Ottoman Empire started to lose ground to the West, there has been much debate about matters that need changing and how change should happen.One group that was both the subject and the agent of the change was the Sufis. One such influential Sufi mujaddid (innovator) was Khālid al-Baghdādī (d.1827). His innovative approaches have allowed Sufism to transform into activism, serving as a model for Sufis as well as for non-Sufi movements across all sectors of life.This study, which explores some conceptual similarities between Khālid al-Baghdādī’s innovative practices and social capital, analyzes his thoughts, and offers a conceptual framework in order to explain the complexity of the activities of the organizations he influenced, and to describe the process of producing social activism out of Sufism and the Sufi orders (ṭarīqa).It is hoped this study, by being the first attempt to look at Sufism from the perspective of social capital theory will serve as a starting point for further research."
Investigations on the Shear Mechanism of Steel-Tube-Reinforced Concrete Shear Walls with a Low Shear-Span Ratio,2019,"['shear wall', 'steel tube', 'shear failure', 'low shear-span ratio', 'shear mechanism']",,"This paper describes the study of steel tube reinforced concrete (STRC) shear walls with a low shear-span ratio, in which steel tubes are embedded in the web of the shear wall. The addition of these steel tubes can significantly improve the shear behavior of ordinary RC shear walls. A series of cyclic loading tests allow us to examine the failure mode, hysteretic behavior, deformability, and energy dissipation capacity of the STRC shear walls. The investigation indicate the STRC shear walls transform from entire section walls to walls with vertical slits under loading. This prevents brittle shear failure and improves the deformation and energy dissipation capacity of the specimens. A softened strut-and-slip model is applied to analyze the shear mechanism of STRC shear walls, and is shown to predict the shear capacity accurately."

However, to the democratic system, in addition to guaranteeing the freedom and equality needed for economic growth and raising awareness of private property rights, as the industrial structure changed, the importance of advanced human resources were emerged. Also, in the case of transition countries that have undergone a process of democratization, after the democratization, the necessity of research on the effect of the level of advanced human resources on economic growth was raised. Thus, in this study analyzed the causal relationship between democracy level- endogenous growth factor-economic growth through two-stage least squares for panel-data model focused on the member countries of the CIS that have been transformed into the democratic system with the collapse of the former Soviet Union from 1991 to 2017. As a result of the analysis, it was found that the level of democracy was positively correlated with the level of advanced human resources, and the level of advanced human resources also had a positive effect on the growth of the national economy. This shows that as the level of democracy increases in transition countries such as CIS member countries, the level of high-level human resources also increases, and it positively affecting economic growth."
Dimension-reduction simulation of stochastic wind velocity fields by  two continuous approaches,2019,"['stochastic wind velocity field', 'continuous proper orthogonal decomposition', 'frequency-wavenumber spectral representation', 'dimension reduction', 'non-uniform wavenumber intervals', 'FFT algorithm']",,"In this study, two original spectral representations of stationary stochastic fields, say the continuous proper orthogonal decomposition (CPOD) and the frequency-wavenumber spectral representation (FWSR), are derived from the Fourier-Stieltjes integral at first. Meanwhile, the relations between the above two representations are discussed detailedly. However, the most widely used conventional Monte Carlo schemes associated with the two representations still leave two difficulties unsolved, say the high dimension of random variables and the incompleteness of probability with respect to the generated sample functions of the stochastic fields. In view of this, a dimension-reduction model involving merely one elementary random variable with the representative points set owing assigned probabilities is proposed, realizing the refined description of probability characteristics for the stochastic fields by generating just several hundred representative samples with assigned probabilities. In addition, for the purpose of overcoming the defects of simulation efficiency and accuracy in the FWSR, an improved scheme of non-uniform wavenumber intervals is suggested. Finally, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm is adopted to further enhance the simulation efficiency of the horizontal stochastic wind velocity fields. Numerical examples fully reveal the validity and superiority of the proposed methods."
Robust Stochastic Sampled-data-based Output Consensus of Heterogeneous Multi-agent Systems Subject to Random DoS Attack: A Markovian Jumping System Approach,2019,"['Distributed control', 'LMI', 'Markovian jump systems', 'multi-agent systems', 'robust control']",,"This paper addresses the robust stochastic sampled-data-based output feedback (SSDBOF) consensuscontroller design for a network of continuous-time heterogeneous multi-agent systems (MASs) in the presence ofdenial-of-service (DoS) attack. Under the mild assumption that the sampling instant is stochastically triggered andsatisfies the Markov property, a homogeneous Markovian jump system (MJS) method is introduced that is capable ofmodeling the stochastic sampled-data-based control system. Furthermore, the randomly occurring Deny-of-Service(DoS) attack problem is also taken into account due to the existence of potential adversary that tries to block thecommunication channels. A novel discrete-time stochastic Markovian system model is first introduced that enablesus to deal with the stochastic sampling and random DoS attack phenomena in a unified framework. Then byadopting the decoupling scheme, some sufficient conditions are proposed such that all the outputs of the followingagents can track the output of the leading agent, and the prescribed H∞ performance level is also guaranteed. Inour work, the SSDBOF consensus controller design method is transformed to a feasibility problem subject to thelinear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints. The theoretical results are finally applied to solve the position trackingproblem of a network of vehicle systems"

Most existing social work theories have failed to respond to multi-dimensional and multi-level hate phenomena which continue to occur since the early 2000s in South Korea toward social minority groups, including women, the handicapped, immigrants, asylum-seekers, people of various gender identities and sexual orientations. This failure is due to the fixed and binary approaches toward hate victims by focusing only on their specific characteristics or one dimension of their identities. The study assumes that hate against social minority groups is generated by the ideology of homogeneity, naturalness, purity and that non-hate social work model should be built based on the theories of which presumptions are the multitude and conviviality. The study provides the spatial social work practice theory of the multitude and conviviality and its action strategies. The theory is based on the concept of the multitude developed by Negri and Hardt, the concept of the conviviality developed by Gilroy, and the concepts and theories of space developed by Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Maffesoli, and theorists of topology and actor-network theory. The theory can help to create the non-hate network-spaces in which every citizens never stop becoming the multitude and producing the process of the convivial common. Action strategies include meeting and empathy between the multitudes, capabilities of sensitive understanding and judgment toward actor-networks, open and flexible association and self-transformation and fluid and equal power implementation, no-barrier practice of various scales, the usage of various non-human actors. The theory can also provide in the age of digital data and artificial intelligence a hint at the importance of the usage of various types of non-human mediators, including texts and technological artifacts."

For preparation, with HPC being used as template, HPC–PAA nanogel was first synthesized by polymerization and crosslinking reaction of acrylic acid (AA) in water solution. In the process, a redox initiator, which composed of ammonium persulfate (APS) and N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED), was used to initiate the reaction. Then, the as-prepared nanogel reacted with Ce(NO3)3 and NH4F solution successively, and a novel CeF3 nanocrystals/HPC–PAA complex nanogel was fabricated. The microstructure of the nanogel was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Thermogravimetric (TG) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The environmental sensitivity of the nanogel was investigated by photoluminescence (PL) and UV–Visible spectrophotometer (UV–Vis). The thermo- and pH-sensitive fluorescence were studied by PL at various temperatures and pH values; besides, the behavior of drug loading and release was researched by PL with a famous antibiotic of Ibuprofen as model drug. The results show that the PL intensity of the nanogel was largely affected by environmental temperature, or content of Ibuprofen loaded in the nanogel. The as-prepared nanogel can be used as useful sensitive material to detect temperature and pH value change, and drug loading or release property of Ibuprofen can be detected by PL emission of the nanogels conveniently."

Korea society has rapidly and compressively reformed into the aged society. In this respect, the diverse media such as documentaries, medical literatures, academic literatures has suggested how and what to do for successful aging. Actually, the successful aging discourses have contributes to resist against characterizing the old people as frailty, dependence, declining states, which transformed cultural and social negative stereotypes of aging into positive images. Hence, recently the rural aging have been highlighted as an alternative successful aging model, compared to urban unsuccessful or ordinary aging. Therefore, rural aging has intentionally constructed and represented with a nostalgia as the ideal aging model, which also regarded as being able to therapy the high competitiveness in urban society. Especially, the images of the rural ‘happy’ old women writing poems become a symbolic feature constructed by mass media in opposition to the relentless competitive urban lives. However, the images of successful rural aging can conceal the inequalities between the old and the marginalized realities of rural aging, as well as stereotypically masking the different or unhappy emotions of rural aging. In conclusion, understanding the elderly people’s lives as a idealism conspire with the internalized orientalism."

대한제국기 이후 삼패의 정치학 - “안진소리”의 기호적 의미,2019,"['Great Korean Empire', 'interpellation', 'Sampae', 'Kungnaebu Hyeplyulsa', 'Kyengsicheng', 'Anjinsori', 'articulation', 'Jeongjae', 'Kwanki', 'Kisaeng', '대한제국', '호명', '삼패', '궁내부 협률사', '일제 경시청', '안진소리', '절현', '정재', '관기', '기생']","대한제국 시기에 삼패는 두 번 호명되었다. 한 번은 대한제국 궁내부로부터 또 한 번은 러일전쟁 직후 일제에 의해 통제되는 경시청으로부터 각각 공연자와 매음부로 규정되었다. 삼패에 대한 호명을 주도했던 권력의 변화 때문에 벌어진 삼패에 대한 규정 차이는 긴장을 야기했다. 그러나 양자 간의 긴장은 규율 권력이 관심을 두지 않았던 가무 활동을 통해 조정되었다. 특정 집단의 정체는 이념이나 권력만으로 구성되는 것이 아니라 각종 행위나 제스처 혹은 이미지 등과 같은 다양한 양식을 통해서도 구체화될 수 있기 때문이었다. 실제로 삼패는 가무 활동을 통해 자신을 규정한 권력에 순종적이기도 했지만 경우에 따라서는 대항하기도 했다. 이에 본고에서는 고종황제의 칭경의례로 상징되는 독립국가의 이념과 러일전쟁 이후 경무청으로 상징되는 제국주의 이념이 삼패 정체의 구성에 어떻게 영향을 미쳤는지 살펴보고, 삼패가 권력에 훈육되어 순종적이었던 점과 한편으로는 권력의 감시 밖에 있었던 기예를 통해 권력에 대항하기도 했음을 정리했다.삼패는 관기와 함께 극장무대에 선 이후 스스로 공연자의 정체를 유지하기 위해 노력했다. 이들은 궁중악무 전문가에게 정재를, 그리고 민간의 가객과 율객에게 풍류를 학습했다. 삼패의 가무 학습은 공연자라는 정체를 유지하는데 중요한 기반이 되었다. 그러나 정재라는 기예는 관기를 정점에 놓는 전근대적 위계구도 속에 비평되었기 때문에 삼패가 절등한 기예에 도달한 경우라 할지라도 관기 이상의 평가를 얻어내지는 못했다. 1912년에 관립극장이 폐관되고 극장가의 주도권이 사설극장으로 넘어간 이후에야 비로소 삼패의 기예에 대한 비평적 입장이 달라지기 시작했다. 흥행계의 자본과 그것의 운영 방식이 합리화되고 한편으로는 대중이 성장하면서 통속가요가 재평가되었기 때문이다. 이에 삼패는 자신들에게 전승되던 안진소리에 매진함으로써 기예 활동에 대한 정당한 평가를 얻어낼 수 있었다. 그 결과 안진소리는 삼패를 절현하는 부호가 되었다. 이 무렵 경무총감부령 제3호(1916)가 발령되면서 삼패는 기생과 법적으로 동등한 존재가 되었다. 이 점에서 삼패의 안진소리는 전근대적 위계는 물론이고 일제의 제국주의적 억압으로부터 벗어나게 하는 부호였다고 이해된다. 삼패가 호명될 때 작동했던 전근대적 위계 구도와 일제가 재생산한 차별 구도는 삼패의 노래를 통해 철폐되었던 것이다.","This paper undertakes to explain the constitutional process of identity of Sampae, a female musician and dancer after the Great Korean Empire. Interpellation of Sampae was tried twice during the Korean Empire era, the first was by the performing bureau, Hyeplyulsa controlled by Kungnaebu of Great Korean Empire, the second by the police agency, Kyengsicheng governed by Japanese colonial apparatus, Tongambu after the Russo-Japanese War. As the change of dominant power during the Korean Empire, The identity of Sampae couldn’t be single. Japanese colonial power re-interpellated Sampae.Interpellation transformed individuals into discursive subjects which were controlled and prescribed by the cultural norms from the dominant power. In 1902 Sampae was interpellated as a performer from the empire theatre to celebrate 40 years for the inauguration and the Mangyuk(the 51th birthday) of the Emperor Kojong. After the Russo-Japanese War Japanese colonial apparatus had the power, they prescribed Sampae as a prostitute from the police agency, Kyengsicheng  controlled by the Japanese colonial power.The process of interpellation is to elaborate an underlying mechanism of ideology her as subject. Actually her body was docile to it. However, Althusserian interpellation is not reducible to ideology as Foucault, Butler, Hall, etc. had said. She could resist it. Because identity consists of various models of identification based upon different signifiers such as behaviors, musical languages, gestures. Sampae’s performing arts could articulate different identities in the subject. In this point I tried to explain signification of Jeongjae  and Ajinsori.As the dominant national theatre was closed in 1912 only private theatres could have run. Then the capital invested to the cultural industry and the running system of the performing arts products changed Sampae’s social position. When the only national theatre was run it couldn't articulate herself with learning and performing the court dance, Jeongjae traditionally belonging to the Kwanki(the official royal female performers or Kisaeng).However her exclusive inheritance called Ajinsori make it possible after 1912. Continuous singing activities of Ajinsori made her escape to prescription of prostitutes. And then Ajinsori made her musicians like Kisaeng. And that tine the administrative decree posted as the third ordinance by the president of Kyengsicheng in 1916. Sampae recovered the position of the performers and then became official Kisaeng. It would be said this is the case of subversion of the hierarchy of pre-modern era and resistance to the force of that days with Anjinsori which was exclusively passed down to Sampae."

And many studies have examined public service motivation as an important predictor of organizational commitment. As an antecedent of organizational commitment, public service motivation has been considered to make positive influences on a wide array of individual- and organizational-level variables.This study focuses on examining the relationship between public service motivation and organizational commitment, using the 2017 Public Employees Viewpoints Survey developed by the Korea Institute of Public Administration. More importantly, the study examines whether organizational culture moderates the relationship between public service motivation and organizational commitment. For organizational culture, the study relies on the competing values model of Quinn & Kimberly(1984); the model classifies organizational culture into the four types: clan culture, adhocracy culture, hierarchy culture, and market culture. The results show that adhocracy culture strengthens the relationship between public service motivation and organizational commitment, whereas market culture weakens the relationship between the two. The results imply that, in public sector settings, innovation-oriented adhocracy culture is more suited for fostering public service motivation’s influence on organizational commitment than productivity-oriented market culture. Finally the study offers three main suggestions to strengthen adhocracy culture in the organization: reshaping organizational characteristics such as formalization and centralization, cultivating transformational leaders, and empowering employees through training programs and by giving them much more discretion."
냉전기 KBS의 ‘자유대한의 소리’ 방송과 對日라디오방송: 동아시아 문화냉전의 파열과 수렴,2019,"['자유대한의 소리 방송', 'KBS', '문화냉전', '파열', '수렴', 'Voice of Free Korea', 'KBS', 'Voice of Free Korea', 'Rupture', 'Convergence']","냉전기 KBS의 자유대한의 소리 일본어방송은 동아시아 냉전의 문화적 양상이 ‘공산 vs 자유’라는 ‘하나의 충돌로 존재하지 않았다’는 사실을 방증하는 역사적 사례에 해당한다. 본 연구에서는 KBS의 자유대한의 소리 일본어방송이 개시된 1955년 전후 시점부터 KBS의 대외방송이 강화되는 1960년대 초반기를 중심으로 하여 동아시아 문화냉전의 시각에서 KBS의 대일(對日)방송이 등장, 변용되어가는 과정을 동아시아 문화냉전의 ‘파열과 수렴’이라는 시각에서 살펴보고자 하였다. 동아시아 문화냉전이 파열되는 시초는 식민지 시기로부터 주어졌지만 파열은 6.25전쟁기를 거치며 본격화되었다. 6.25전쟁기 사상심리전 매체였던 VOA와 VUNC의 중계를 위해 유엔사령부가 NHK네트워크를 활용하게 됨으로써 NHK의 방송출력은 증강될 수 있었고, 이를 통해 의도치 않게 한반도가 사실상의 일본방송 권역에 포함되는 상황이 연출되었던 것이다. 이로써 한국과 일본 간의 문화적 경계는 냉전질서라는 지정학적 조건에 의해 흐려지게 되었고, 이는 전쟁 이후에도 지속적으로 일상적으로 일본방송을 청취할 수 있게 되었다. 이와 같이 일본과의 문화적 경계가 흐려지는 1950년대 초의 시대적 상황 속에서, 해양의 국가경계를 둘러싼 한일 간의 외교적 마찰이 격화되는 1955년 무렵, 상대 국가의 영토로 방송전파를 보냄으로써 선전전을 강화하고자 한 이승만 대통령의 지시에 의해 ‘자유대한의 소리 일본어방송’은 개시되었다.그러나 4.19 혁명으로 인해 자유언론에 대한 사회적 기대감이 컸던 만큼, 대일방송 또한 일정정도 기존의 일방적인 선전 위주의 방식에서 벗어나게 됨으로써 한일 간의 외교적 대립이 만들어내는 문화냉전의 파열은 점차 수렴되는 징후를 보였다. 5.16군사쿠데타 직후인 1961년 7월 1일에 단행된 독립방송국 ‘서울국제방송국’의 출범은 이전 시기의 ‘2중방송’의 기술적․제도적 틀에서 한 단계 도약한‘심리전의 요람’의 탄생이라는 측면에서 파열되었던 동아시아 문화냉전이 다시 수렴되는 첫 출발점이었다. 무엇보다 서울국제방송국의 모델이 같은 처지의 반공국가였던 대만의 심리전 방송이었다는 점에서 그러했다. 또한 1961년 7월‘서울국제방송국’의 발족 이후 표면적으로는 대일방송이 강화되는 방향으로 나아갔지만, 경제개발을 위해 일본과의 국교정상화를 추진했던 박정희 정부의 대일정책 변화에 대응하여 재일교포의 사상적 이탈과 반역을 예방하는 방식으로 대일방송의 성격을 대공적 성격을 강화시키는 방향으로 전환시키고자 한 정책이 낳은 결과였다. 이로써 1950년대 동아시아 문화냉전의 파열선은 1960년대에 들어 본래 문화냉전의 기조로 수렴되는 방식으로 변화되었다.","‘Voice of Free Korea’ broadcasting of Japanese language by KBS constitutes a historical example of the cultural aspect of the East Asian Cold War that “did not exist as a single conflict” of “Communist vs. Freedom”. While KBS, which was in charge of one of the pillars of the East Asian radio war, had a ruptured sound in the U.S-led Cold War radio war through its broadcast to Japan, it had shown a very close cooperation system with Taiwan, which was the first country in which Korea established diplomatic ties. In this study, we wanted to take a look at the process of the emergence and transformation of KBS's Japan-tarketed broadcasting from the perspective of the ‘rupture and convergence’ of the East Asia Cold War, focusing on the early 1960s when KBS's international broadcasting was strengthened from around the time of its launch in 1955.The beginning of the rupture of the East Asian Cultural Cold War was given from the colonial period, but the rupture began in earnest through the Korean War. NHK's broadcasting power could be boosted by the use of NHK network by the UN Command for broadcasting of VOA and VUNC, which were psychological warfare media during the Korean War, which inadvertently led to the Korean Peninsula being included in the de facto Japanese broadcasting zone. This has clouded the cultural boundaries between Korea and Japan under the geopolitical conditions of the Cold War order, which allows them to listen to Japanese broadcasts on a daily basis even after the war. Amid this blurring cultural boundaries with Japan, the ‘Voice of Free Korea’ broadcasting of Japanese language by KBS was launched around 1955, when the diplomatic row between Korea and Japan over the maritime border intensified, at the instruction of President Syngman Rhee, who wanted to intensify the propaganda campaign by sending broadcasts into the territory of the other country. However, as the 4.19 revolution raised social expectations for the free press, broadcasting to Japan also showed signs of gradually converging the rupture of the cultural Cold War created by the diplomatic confrontation between Korea and Japan, as was removed from the conventional one-sided propaganda-oriented method.The launch of the independent broadcasting station “Seoul International Broadcasting Station” on July 1, 1961, shortly after the 5.16 military coup, was the first starting point for the reconvening of the East Asian cultural Cold War, which was ruptured in terms of the birth of the cradle of psychological warfare, a step taken from the technological and institutional framework of the previous period'. Most of all, it was because the model of the Seoul International Broadcasting Station was a psychological warfare broadcast by Taiwan, which was an anti-communist country in the same situation. It was also the result of a policy aimed at enhancing the anti-Japanese character by preventing ideological departures and treason of ethnic Koreans in Japan in response to a change in the Park Chung-hee administration's policy toward Japan, which ostensibly sought to normalize diplomatic relations with Japan for economic development.As a result, the rupture line of the East Asian Cultural Cold War in the 1950s changed in the 1960s to converge into the original principle of the Cultural Cold War."

In other words, the value of arts in the business world is about “aesthetics skill”, which refers not to just “beauty” but to the way of participation of human resources into organization as a mean to solve thorny issue. Likewise, an organization which has the aesthetics skill is easy to deliver the value of arts to interested persons while enhancing the quality of company and promoting the capability.This study analyzes cases about transformation of human resources based on the Arts Value Matrix according to the business models that adopted artist dispatch service. It is a project for promoting social welfare among artists and realization of artistic value for the organization, while dispatching artists to the companies to conduct works that require creativity and artistic communication and paying them by the government. This study analyzes the type of human resources of the Arts Value Matrix with four models of the companies and it turns out “formation of network” and “transformation” played the biggest role in the process.As a result, an organization who materialize the skill of arts expands the existing business model and creates new issues while attaining the differences with the enterprises that do not adopt value of arts. In case of artists, this fulfills the social value of arts considering the rise of personal income from the artistic activity, the changed view toward the arts among the business members and higher satisfaction among the public. For consumers, this gave emotional contentment and offered the chance for a new culture and cultural benefit. Through the case study, it is turned out diverse kinds of organizations require to pursue working process with artistic intervention to enhance business capability by creating improved image of company, value of artist and satisfaction from consumer."

The subjects included 2,135 K League games held in 17 venues between 2008 and 2017, and data included game related data from the Korean Football Association and weather related data from the Korea Meteorological Administration. Analysis included descriptive analysis, regression analysis, calculation using the Wang transform model and Monte Carlo simulation, and the results are as follows: First, not only temperature, precipitation, wind velocity, humidity, sand dust affect number of spectators, the affect of the same weather factor differs according to time before game start. Second, the affect of weather differ according to venue, but affect of temperature and precipitation is relatively higher such that temperature is an appropriate asset for a weather derivative. Third, for Incheon Stadium which is located in a metropolitan area and has a relatively large number of spectators, the number is predicted to reduce by 58% if the temperature is within 15-20 degrees, and it probability of happening was calculated to be 18.14%. By applying a 12000won ticket price, appropriate compensation was calculated at 6,536,810won. So upon considering the soccer club’s risk level preference. the appropriate price for temperature based weather derivative was calculated to be annually between 2,970,000won and 5,800,000won."
케노시스론의 페미니스트 신학적 함의 ― 사라 코클리의 케노시스론을 중심으로,2019,"['kenōsis', 'Kenoticism', 'Feminist Theology', 'Sarah Coakley', 'Power-in- Vulnerability', 'Contemplative Prayer ‧', '케노시스', '케노시스론', '페미니스트 신학', '사라 코클리', '취약성-안에-있는- 힘', '관상기도']","이 연구는 다음의 질문과 함께 사라 코클리(Sarah Coakley)의 케노시스론을 탐구한다. “케노시스(kenōsis)가 가부장적 사회 속에서 오랫동안 억압과 희생을 경험해왔던 여성들에게도 여전히 유효한 개념인가? 만약 유효하다고 한다면, 어떻게 이것이 여성들에게 도움이될 수 있는가?” 연구자는 이 질문에 대한 대답의 가능성을 코클리의신학 속에서 발견한다. 이 연구의 목적은 코클리 케노시스론의 통찰을 빌어, 케노시스 개념을 페미니스트 신학의 관점에서 재해석하는데 있다.코클리의 케노시스론은 케노시스 교리를 다루는 다른 페미니스트 신학자들과 비교해 보았을 때, 매우 독특하다. 그녀는 ‘케노시스의 인간적 형식’만이 여성들의 힘을 북돋우는데 유용한 모델이라고 주장하며, 케노시스를 그리스도의 신성, 혹은 하나님의 본성까지 확장시키기를 거부한다. 이러한 맥락에서 코클리는 ‘비(非)케노시스적 신성’(nonkenotic divinity)과 ‘케노시스적 인성’(kenotic humanity)을 연결시키는 케노시스론을 구성한다. 본 연구는 그녀의 이러한 주장이케노시스론을 페미니스트 신학적으로 재해석하기 위한 긍정적 토대를 제공한다고 평가한다. 무엇보다 그녀가 신적 차원의 케노시스를 거부하는 이유는, 하나님이 모든 힘의 궁극적 원천이자 근원이라는것을 강조하기 위함이다. 케노시스를 신적 속성으로 파악하는 것은하나님의 전능성을 포기하고 철회하는 것이다. 나아가 하나님을 인간의 수준으로 제한하는 것이며, 생명을 지탱할 수 없는 무력한 존재로 만들어 버리는 것이다. 이렇게 희생당하는 하나님, 무력한 하나님이미지는 희생과 무력함을 정당화하고 고착화시키는 지배이데올로기가 된다. 요컨대, 그녀는 힘의 원천으로서의 전능한 신성을 보호하기 위해서 인간적 형식의 케노시스만을 유의미하게 받아들인다.코클리에 따르면 인간적 차원의 케노시스는 하나님의 힘을 경험하기 위한 중요한 영적 자원이다. 그녀는 자신의 케노시스론의 핵심을“힘과 취약성(혹은 케노시스)의 역설”로 규정하며, 이를 “취약성-안에-있는-힘(power-in-vulnerability)”이란 정식으로 표현한다. 그녀는‘취약성-안에-있는-힘’을 경험하기 위한 영적 방법으로서 ‘관상기도’(contemplative prayer)를 제안한다. 관상기도를 통해 우리는 하나님의 하나님 되심을 경험하게 되고, 나아가 ‘신율적 자아’(theonomous selfhood)로 변하게 된다. 즉 하나님 앞에 침묵으로 나아가는 관상기도 속에서, 취약성이라는 형식을 통해, 우리는 힘의-북돋움의근원으로서 하나님을 인식하게 되고, 나아가 하나님을 향해 우리 자신이 확장되고 변형되는 경험을 하게 된다. 이는 남성과 여성을 차별하지 않는 모두를 위한 공동의 영적인 방법이다.","This study engages Sarah Coakley’s kenoticism with some critical questions: Is kenotic ethics meaningful for women who often sacrifice their viable sense of identity or struggle to define their subjectivity while living in patriarchal societies, and how can the concept of kenōsis become helpful for women in such contexts? The answers to these questions could be found in my reading of Coakley. The aim of this project is to reinterpret the notion of kenōsis as a helpful and meaningful resource for building women’s subjectivity, based on her kenoticism.Coakley takes a unique stance when interpreting the doctrine of kenōsis from a feminist perspective, compared to other feminist theologians. She insists that only the human form of kenōsis can be the grounds of God’s empowerment for women; thus she is critical of expanding it into an intrinsic attribute of God. In this sense, Coakley sets forth the unique kenotic theory pairing ‘non-kenotic divinity’ with ‘kenotic humanity.’ This study assess that Coakley’s kenoticism offers positive theoretical basis to reinterpret the concept of kenōsis from a feminist perspective. The most important reason why Coakley opposes divine kenōsis is to highlight God as the foundational and ultimate source of empowerment for all humans. For her, recognizing kenōsis as a divine characteristic is actually relinquishing or undermining God’s certain attributes like omnipotence or omniscience. Moreover, it is to shear God down to human size and thus to make God intrinsically weak, incapable of sustaining and nurturing all created things. A selfemptying God is an inappropriate and even dangerous divine image for women, since a powerless and vulnerable God can encourage and justify their powerlessness and vulnerability. In brief, in order to advocate the omnipotent God who nurtures, sustains, and empowers all creatures, Coakley only accepts the human form of kenōsis.According to Coakley, human kenōsis is a crucial spiritual resource to encounter divine power. She terms the core of her own kenoticism “the paradox of power and vulnerability,” and defines kenōsis as “power-in-vulne- rability.” In this context, she proposes ‘contemplative prayer’ as a principal method to experience the paradox of power-vulnerability. Contemplative prayer makes room for God to be God, and radically transforms our own selfhood to theonomous selfhood. That is to say, the act of willed vulnerability in contemplative prayer encourages us to move towards God as the infinite source of empowerment, then to redirect our own false desire to the true desire, and ultimately to make us unite with God. This is a common spiritual aim for both men and women."
Agastache rugosa Kuntze Attenuates UVB-Induced Photoaging in Hairless Mice through the Regulation of MAPK/AP-1 and TGF-β/ Smad Pathways,2019,"['Agastache rugosa Kuntze', 'collagen', 'Korean mint', 'photoaging', 'skin moisture']",,"Chronic exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, regarded as a major cause of extrinsic aging or photoaging characterized by wrinkle formation and skin dehydration, exerts adverse effects on skin by causing the overproduction of reactive oxygen species. Agastache rugosa Kuntze, known as Korean mint, possesses a wide spectrum of biological properties including antioxidation, anti-inflammation, and anti-atherosclerosis. Previous studies have reported that A. rugosa protected human keratinocytes against UVB irradiation by restoring the anti-oxidant defense system. However, the anti-photoaging effect of A. rugosa extract (ARE) in animal models has not yet been evaluated. ARE was orally administered to hairless mice at doses of 100 or 250 mg/kg/day along with UVB exposure for 12 weeks. ARE histologically improved UVB-induced wrinkle formation, epidermal thickening, erythema, and hyperpigmentation. In addition, ARE recovered skin moisture by improving skin hydration and transepidermal water loss (TEWL). Along with this, ARE increased hyaluronic acid levels by upregulating HA synthase genes. ARE markedly increased the density of collagen and the amounts of hydroxypoline via two pathways. First, ARE significantly downregulated the mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinases responsible for collagen degradation by inactivating the mitogen-activated protein kinase/activator protein 1 pathway. Second, ARE stimulated the transforming growth factor beta/Smad signaling, consequently raising the mRNA levels of collagen-related genes. In addition, ARE not only increased the mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes but also decreased inflammatory cytokines by blocking the protein expression of nuclear factor kappa B. Collectively, our findings suggest that A. rugosa may be a potential preventive and therapeutic agent for photoaging."

The educational circles are confronted with the tricky issue of how to improve children’s creativity. Against the research background, this research aims at introducing the essence of the college’s curriculum design based on “morphological cognition” to fine art education for pupils to develop children’s creative thinking and exploring new measures to fundamentally promote children’s creativity according to children’s physical, mental and intelligence characteristics. To start with, a thorough literature review is conducted of theories related to creativity. Next,, with “morphological cognition” creativity teaching as the strategy, three layers of the“morphological cognition” creativity development model, including morphological understanding, morphological analysis and morphological transformation, are combined to develop three experimental courses for “morphological cognition” creativity thinking. These courses are applied to the primary school fine art teaching of Dalian Lingshui Primary School Fine Art College in China. Training revolves around observation, comprehension and analysis of natural forms, abstract forms, and personified forms at an attempt to stimulate pupils’ imagination and creativity. Different groups are chosen to compare their teaching effects before and after the adoption of the above said courses. After that, the “Williams Creativity Assessment Packet” (CAP) is used to assess pupils’ creativity in terms of fluency, openness, flexibility, ingenuity, and precision. Finally, to what extent “morphological cognition” creative thinking education can influence pupils’ creativity is summarized. The research finding is referential to the improvement of children’s creativity, and can provide a new research thinking to usher in a new pattern for creativity education."

OPD is the diversified data, it includes demographic and diseases of patient, so it need to be clustered in order to explore the hidden rules and the relationship of data types of patient's information. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for unsupervised clustering of patient's demographic and diseases in OPD. Firstly, we collect data from a hospital at OPD. Then, we preprocess and transform data by using powerful techniques such as standardization, label encoder, and categorical encoder. After obtaining transformed data, we use some strong experiments, techniques, and evaluation to select the best number of clusters and best clustering algorithm. In addition, we use some tests and measurements to analyze and evaluate cluster tendency, models, and algorithms. Finally, we obtain the results to analyze and discover new knowledge, meanings, and rules. Clusters that are found out in this research provide knowledge to medical managers and doctors. From these information, they can improve the patient management methods, patient arrangement methods, and doctor's ability.

Hybrid-Boost Modular Multilevel Converter-Based Medium-Voltage Multiphase Induction Motor Drive for Subsea Applications,2019,"['Five phase', 'Hybrid boost', 'Medium voltage', 'Motor drive', 'Subsea']",,"This paper proposes a hybrid-boost Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) for the Medium-Voltage (MV) Variable Speed Drives (VSDs) employed in subsea applications, such as oil and gas recovery. In the presented architecture, a hybrid-boost MMC with a reduced number of semiconductor devices driving a multiphase Induction Machine (IM) is investigated. The stepped output voltage generated by the MMC reduces or eliminates the filtering requirements. Moreover, the boosting capability of the proposed architecture eliminates the need for bulky low-frequency transformers at the converter output terminals. A detailed illustration of the hybrid-boost MMC operation, the expected limitations/constraints, and the voltage balancing technique are presented. A simulation model of the proposed MV hybrid-boost MMC-based five-phase IM drive has been built to investigate the system performance. Finally, a downscaled prototype has been constructed for experimental verification."
The Strategy of the Process of Unification between South Korea and North Korea in Dissimilar Administrative and Political Theory,2019,"['Idealism', 'Realism', 'Socialist Market Economy', 'Unification']",,"The strategy of idealism rather than realism is required to deliver a peaceful solution on the Korean Peninsular. It is needed to understand the dissimilar ideas, theories, and cultures in South Korea and North Korea, which have affected the social, political, and cultural situation. If North Korea wishes to attain economic growth, as a matter of fact, it is requisite to adopt the strategy of socialist market economy, such as the case of China and Vietnam. It is beneficial and effective to apply in whole or part the reform model of China and Vietnam for North Korea, which will contribute to accomplish economic growth for North Korea and to arbitrate the extreme ideological difference between South Korea and North Korea.Strategic transformation and ideological understanding on the Korean Peninsular is essentially required to avoid extremely problematic and violent situation and circumstance. Four alternative unification scenarios described by Pollack & Lee can be explained as the course of the unification between South Korea and North Korea:“(1) integration and peaceful unification; (2) collapse and absorption; (3) unification through conflict; and (4) disequilibrium and potential external intervention.” It is prerequisite to alleviate the ideological difference between South Korea and North Korea for pursuing peaceful unification and integration as the adoption of idealism."
Direct Position Determination of Coherently Distributed Sources based on Compressed Sensing with a Moving Nested Array,2019,"['Direct position determinations(DPD)', 'Nested array', 'distributed source', 'compressed sensing', 'vectorization']",,"The existing direct position determinations(DPD) for coherently distributed(CD) sources are mostly applicable for uniform linear array(ULA), which result in a low degree of freedom(DOF), and it is difficult for them to realize the effective positioning in underdetermined condition. In this paper, a novel DPD algorithm for coherently distributed sources based on compressed sensing with a moving nested array is present. In this algorithm, the nested array is introduced to DPD firstly, and a positioning model of signal moving station based on nested array is constructed. Owing to the features of coherently distributed sources, the cost function of compressed sensing is established based on vectorization. For the sake of convenience, unconstrained transformation and convex transformation of cost functions are carried out. Finally, the position coordinates of the distribution source signals are obtained according to the theory of optimization. At the same time, the complexity is analyzed, and the simulation results show that, in comparison with two-step positioning algorithms and subspace-based algorithms, the proposed algorithm effectively solves the positioning problem in underdetermined condition with the same physical element number."
Gemigliptin Attenuates Renal Fibrosis Through Down- Regulation of the NLRP3 Inflammasome,2019,"['Dipeptidyl-peptidase IV inhibitors', 'Fibrosis', 'Inflammasomes', 'Kidney', 'LC15-0444 (Gemigliptin)']",,"Background: The hypoglycemic drugs dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have proven protective effects on diabetic kidney disease, including renal fibrosis. Although NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation is known to play an important role in the progression of renal fibrosis, the impact of DPP-4 inhibition on NLRP3-mediated inflammation while ameliorating renal fibrosis has not been fully elucidated. Here, we report that the renoprotective effect of gemigliptin is associated with a reduction in NLRP3-mediated inflammation in a murine model of renal fibrosis.Methods: We examined the effects of gemigliptin on renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis induced in mice by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Using immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis, we quantitated components of the NLRP3 inflammasome in kidneys with and without gemigliptin treatment, and in vitro in human kidney tubular epithelial human renal proximal tubule cells (HK-2) cells, we further analyzed the effect of gemigliptin on transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-stimulated production of profibrotic proteins Results: Immunohistological examination revealed that gemigliptin ameliorated UUO-induced tubular atrophy and renal fibrosis.Gemigliptin-treated kidneys showed a reduction in levels of NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), caspase-1, and interleukin-1β, which had all been markedly increased by UUO. In line with the in vivo results, TGF-β markedly increased NLRP3 inflammasome markers, which were attenuated by gemigliptin treatment. Furthermore, gemigliptin treatment attenuated phosphorylated nuclear factor-κB levels, which had been increased in the UUO kidney as well as in TGF-β-treated cultured renal cells.Conclusion: The present study shows that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome contributes to UUO-induced renal fibrosis and the renoprotective effect of gemigliptin is associated with attenuation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation."
Repair Decision Based on Sensitivity Analysis for Aero-Engine Assembly,2019,['Aero-engine Run-out Deviation propagation analysis Sensitivity analysis Repair decision'],,"Strict requirements for concentricity of the multistage high pressure rotor of an aero-engine are employed to guarantee performances such as vibration. Tedious and time-wasting trial assembly by adjusting the installation angles of stages is needed to meet the requirements due to the lack of effective analysis methods. Furthermore, there is no quick way to find out where the problem is and how to repair the parts when the installation-angle-adjusting method fails. This article focuses on a solution to optimize the installation angle of each stage and to make repair decisions in the assembly process. The run-out data are processed by least square method to get the spatial positions and attitudes of flanges and a deviation propagation analysis model is built by virtue of homogeneous coordinate transformation theory to predict the accumulative errors of each stage. The eccentricities of stages are evaluated with reference to the common axis and the installation angles of stages are optimized by minimizing the sum of eccentricities. Sensitivities of eccentricity, eccentric angle and parallelism of each stage are analyzed and repair decisions for parts are made to meet more strict requirements. An example of a three-stage subassembly is presented to demonstrate the solution."

More specifically, it deduces the significance of Confucianism to the leader absolutism and hereditary system of North Korea as a theoretical approach to analyzing the possibility of North Korea's denuclearization, change and transformation of Juche ideology as a basis for future prospects of economic reform and opening. The analysis is basically based on the recognition that the superstructures, namely, consciousness, ideology, and ideology, spoken in Marx's historical materialism, played a key role in the construction of the regime. On the other hand, it is also essential to understand the base, which is another axis of historical materialism, that is the change in productive forces and production relations.To this end, Chapter 2 briefly summarizes the history of North Korea's economic reforms, analyzes the changes in the North Korean economy since Kim Jong-un took office, especially the so-called “new economy,” and examines its implications for the North Korean regime change. Chapter 3 examines the specificity of North Korea's economic reform by comparing its influence from the superstructure, especially Confucianism, in comparison with China and Vietnam, which can be a model for future economic reform.Chapter 4 summarizes the above discussion and presents future research tasks.It is unknown whether North Korea, which professed to have completed an absolute ideology of leader absolutism and a military power of nuclear force, will give up its ideology and nuclear weapons to build its economic power. The key to success will be whether Kim Jong-un's centralized strategy of economic construction or economic-priority line permits partial transformation or modification of the Juche ideology and, if so, to what extent. This change of thought will be a prerequisite for nuclear abandonment."

Over the last 30 years, there has been significant progress in the development and validation of cognitive behavioral treatments and motivational enhancement approaches for AUD.The goal of psychosocial treatment is to help patients control their urges to use alcohol and remain abstinent by preventing relapse. This review explored first, motivation enhancement therapy, which is an approach to help people with alcohol problems and improve their motivation for change, and second, cognitive behavioral theories for AUD, including practical therapeutic effects, treatment principles, and various treatment methods and techniques. These treatment modalities are particularly useful for patients with AUDs with insufficient or poor compliance. In addition, these treatment models, which enhance the motivation of patients with chronic psychiatric illness, including AUDs and improve the efficacy and effectiveness through a clear intervention approach to the targeted problems, have been transformed into various other forms. Recently, there have been many studies on various online platforms, such as web-based and virtual reality, which are easy to access, and these treatment models are likely to become more important in the psychiatric field in the future."

As a highly specialized researcher, he carried out three archaeological expeditions in the tradition of French Sinology, under the influence of Edouard Chavannes, and he tried to give final expressions to the result of the second exploration which was largely appreciated, in a treaty on Chinese sculpture. Many works didn’t come out in his lifetime, until they are published successively during last century, and collected to constitute Oeuvre completes (Complete Works). Besides poems and novels, his field manuscripts and report are given greater importance to understand his achievements. We tried to accentuate some concrete aspects of his comprehension of China, in this viewpoint: sinologist and poet in Segalen are not separated, leading an unique conception of this land. Steles, the first collection of his poetry, is chiefly based on his first expedition, as well as on other lived experiences or readings concerned with the subject. Chinese nature is seldom described in pure geographical entities, as mountains or plateau as they really exist, but it is quickly transformed into a historicized and civilized space. Imperial tombs are representative of this spatial attraction: signifying the center of land where the soul of the dead rests. The “soul's way” is owned by the spirit who wanders there. “Soul's place” or soul’s tablet is a more essential spot, where can be achieved the union of sign and reality. The true place is, however, denied, in the insight that the center of world is a fictive notion, and the name of reality is hidden. Writings posterior to his second expedition reveal a subtle change, difficult to perceive, in his conception of the order latent in Chinese nature or space. In the description of land center in the last page of Chine, la Grande Statuaire(China, the great statuary), the tomb is not a vacant center: it plays the role of giving rational reasons (rationale) to the renewed order, composed of many concentric circles, capable of casting a glance to the farmost circumferences. The center has a duty to be more than itself, to be incorporated into a higher being, and this quest for the height becomes the main subject of Thibet, his last poems. In La Grande Statuaire, he reevaluated the great statue of Leshan Buddha, which he described as being faced towards “Omi” and Thibet. Omi, an error of EFEO transcription of Omei, is rather a lapsus giving rise to a moving literary expression, and it's origin can be found in the diary of his first visit to that mountain where he listened to the psalmody “O-mi-to-fo”, which echoed into two place names of Omi and Thibet (or Töbod), after some years. Segalen was a researcher and poet, who perceived and analyzed the Chinese civilization in the traditional context of imperial order, and he didn't go out moreover to really sympathize with the Chinese historical aspirations of the new century. We can criticize that his comprehension of China has severe limitations in this respect. His last-reached standpoint of the center and circumference, however, is still valuable."

Patterns in the real world can create fashion in fashion design apps through digitization. Among them, aesthetic characteristics such as disembedding, hybridity, and hyper-reality were shown."
Nonlinear material functions under medium amplitude oscillatory shear (MAOS) flow,2019,"['medium amplitude oscillatory shear', 'MAOS moduli', 'FT rheology', 'material functions', 'nonlinear rheology']",,"Dynamic oscillatory shear flow has been widely used to investigate viscoelastic material functions. In particular, small amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) tests have become the canonical method for characterizing the linear viscoelastic properties of complex fluids based on strong theoretical background and plenty of experimental results. Recently, there has been increasing interest in the use of large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) tests for the characterization of complex fluids. However, it is difficult to define material functions in LAOS regime due to an infinite number of higher harmonic contributions. For this reason, many recent studies have focused on intrinsic nonlinearities obtained in medium amplitude oscillatory shear (MAOS) regime, which is a subdivision of the full LAOS regime. In this study, we reviewed recent experimental and theoretical results of nonlinear material functions in the MAOS regime, which contain four MAOS moduli (two first-harmonic moduli and two third-harmonic moduli) from Fourier and power series of shear stress, and a nonlinear material function Q0 and its elastic and viscous parts from Fourier-transform rheology (FT rheology). Furthermore, to identify linear-to-nonlinear transitions in stress response of model polystyrene (PS) solutions, we presented Pipkin diagrams in frequency ranges from the rubbery plateau region to the terminal region."
Development and Optimization of Alendronate Sodium Loaded PLGA Nanoparticles by Central Composite Design,2019,"['Central composite design', 'Nanoparticle', 'Biphosphonates', 'PLGA.']",,"Alendronate sodium (AS) which supresses the activity of osteoclastic cells and leads to the inhibition of bone resorption, is one of the most clinically preferred drug for the treatment of osteoporosis. The purpose of this research is to develop an optimization method for AS loaded poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticle formulation which is prepared by nanoprecipitation method and is intended for local application to provide enhanced guided bone regeneration. Nanoparticle formulation parameters including AS content, polymer/surfactant ratio and organic to aqueous phase ratio were optimized to evaluate their effects on particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential and entrapment efficiency by using central composite experimental design (CCD). Morphology of nanoparticles was visualized with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and interaction between nanoparticle components was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The developed quadratic model showed high correlation (R2>0.89) between predicted response and evaluated parameters. Spherical nanoparticles with mean particle size of <84 nm and encapsulation efficiency with >34.68% were produced with the optimized nanoparticle preparation method. The optimization of AS encapsulating PLGA nanoparticles by utilizing CCD method, allowed us to prepare the nanoparticle formulation with optimum properties with less experiments. Consequently, this optimized model can be applied to predict the characteristics of nanoparticles prepared with nanoprecipitation method by using PLGA polymer."

As a consequence, the appearance of society changed greatly and people enjoyed a more abundant and prosperous life-style as a result of the reform of political system and the development of scientific-technology. However, on the other hand, Japan before the Second World War rushed to become a colonial power under the slogan of ‘rich nation and strong army,’ and after the Second World War was affected by the negative effects produced by modernization such as pollution, nuclear plant accidents, and international antagonisms resulting from the competition for resources. However, these problems are not only faced by Japan all nations that have developed along the lines of the Western model of modernization. Considering this ‘negative legacy,’ this paper looked back on the theory of modernization adopted by Japan after the Second World War, and outlined the formation and change of the theory of development from within the country as proposed by Tsurumi Kazuko (鶴見和子; 1918~2006). Tsurumi Kazuko uncovered new meanings of identity based on solidarity and coexistence through investigation of Japanese folklore and by confronting the severe health problems caused by industrial pollution. This paper traced this process of re-evaluation and examined the pattern of indigenous modernity in post Second World War Japan."

The Geospatial Schemes based on Topo-Climatology (GSTP) was developed to simulate such variations effectively. In the present study, we reviewed the progress of the geospatial schemes for production of farm-scale agricultural weather data. Efforts have been made to improve the GSTP since 2000s. The schemes were used to provide climate information based on the current normal year and future climate scenarios at a landscape scale. The digital climate maps for the normal year include the maps of the monthly minimum temperature, maximum temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation in the past 30 years at 30 m or 270 m spatial resolution. Based on these digital climate maps, future climate change scenario maps were also produced at the high spatial resolution. These maps have been used for climate change impact assessment at the field scale by reprocessing them and transforming them into various forms. In the 2010s, the GSTP model was used to produce information for farm-specific weather conditions and weather forecast data on a landscape scale. The microclimate models of which the GSTP model consists have been improved to provide detailed weather condition data based on daily weather observation data in recent development. Using such daily data, the Early warning service for agrometeorological hazard has been developed to provide weather forecasts in real-time by processing a digital forecast and mid-term weather forecast data (KMA) at 30 m spatial resolution. Currently, daily minimum temperature, maximum temperature, precipitation, solar radiation quantity, and the duration of sunshine are forecasted as detailed weather conditions and forecast information. Moreover, based on farm-specific past-current-future weather information, growth information for various crops and agrometeorological disaster forecasts have been produced."

Following the fall of the Roman Empire, the progress slowed until the Renaissance renewed scientific interest in anatomy and physiology, ushering in an era of spectacular advances. Alongside the discoveries of modern science, innovations in media such as printing, photography and color reproduction, improved the accuracy of communicating science. Techniques for noninvasively viewing the human body, such as magnetic resonance imaging, opened up new ways of exploring and understanding anatomy, physiology, and disease pathogenesis. Advances in three-dimensional (3D)-technologies, including computer graphics and animation are directly linked to many advances in medicine and surgery. Anatomy education has come a long way from papyrus leaf inscriptions to computerized 3D modeling, holographic representation, and virtual reality-based software. The future presents unlimited options for studying and understanding anatomy as Google glasses, bioprinting, virtual reality, and allied technologies transform the world into a classroom.

Cell proliferation was measured by flow cytometry and cell counting. Mice carotid arteries were ligated and treated with CQ or HCQ every other day for 3 weeks. Pathological changes of carotid arteries were visualized by both microscopy and fluorescence microscopy.Results: CQ and HCQ increase AMPK phosphorylation in VSMCs. Both CQ and HCQ decrease platelet-derived growth factor-induced VSMC proliferation and cell cycle progression in an AMPK-dependent manner. In addition, CQ and HCQ inhibit Smad3 phosphorylation and VSMC proliferation induced by transforming growth factor-β1.Moreover, CQ and HCQ diminished neointimal proliferation in a mouse model of carotid artery ligation-induced neointima formation.Conclusion: The results demonstrated that CQ and HCQ inhibit cell proliferation and cell cycle progression in VSMCs via the AMPK-dependent signaling pathway. Carotid artery ligation-induced intima thickness was reduced in mouse arteries treated with CQ or HCQ, suggesting a role for antimalarial drugs in treating atherosclerosis and restenosis."

Furthermore, this study is to clarify the characteristics and problems of the franchise by identifying the differences in cost management to support franchisees when the sales of franchise headquarters decrease due to the decrease in the demand of franchisees according to the business type related to the franchise management policy of the franchise headquarters which affect the competitiveness of franchisees.[Methodology]This study used a total of 2,115 companies－year samples from 2000 to 2016 extracted from Kis－Value of Korea Credit Rating (Stock) for companies subject to external auditing act of corporation, which were registered with an information disclosure form at the Fair Trade Commission as of December 31, 2017. The model for analysis used is a multiple regression model by Anderson et al.(2003) and further analysis was conducted to ensure the robustness of the conclusion.[Findings]As a result of the study, the business characteristics of franchise companies tended to increase the cost reduction when the sales decreased compared to non－franchise companies. Furthermore, we have confirmed that among franchise companies, there is a difference in the functional role of franchisees depending on whether they are business franchises or product distribution franchises, so that when sales declined product distribution franchises are relatively more reducing cost than business franchises. This result means that the franchise's business characteristics are easy to enter and withdraw from the franchise business because of low investment costs and fixed operating costs, and that the surplus is immediately controlled if the demand for franchisees decreases. In addition, among franchise companies, product distribution franchises reflect the reality of the domestic franchise market, which is inevitably weakening the competitiveness of franchisees because they pursue short－term profitability of franchise headquarters rather than long－term support for franchisees compared to business franchises.[Policy Implications]The results of this study suggest that in order to strengthen the competitiveness of franchisees in the domestic franchise market, franchise companies need to transform their business form into a business franchise and strengthen their management support functions for franchisees through long－term investments. Second, this study is the first study on the cost behavior of franchise companies. In the future, it is necessary to expand the understanding of the characteristics of franchise businesses and the characteristics of enterprises through further research on various factors affecting cost behavior. This additional discussion will provide useful information for decision making by various stakeholders, including franchisee owners, investors, and governments, related to the franchise business."

Labor is also a subject regarding every human being to the point where one could call humans ‘working humans’. Considering the above, it is therefore clear that the 4th Industrial Revolution will present multiple questions regarding the labor of the ‘working human’. The 4th Revolution will bring with it the end of human labor, fundamentally reshap- ing the conditions of the labor market as well as the market itself. It will bring about a ‘work-free market’, by extension a ‘labor-free society’ and minimize socioeconomic inequality. Simultaneously, it will also present the current social safety net with various problems.This thesis discusses a new understanding of human labor in the context of a transformed labor market after the 4th Industrial Revolution. Furthermore, it will question whether Christian labor ethics formed after the Reformation are still valid. If not, this thesis will try to establish a model for labor ethics that is still applicable to Christian morals, shedding new light on Reformers’ understanding of labor.Through such discussions, we will come to understand two important char- acteristics of labor. First of all, that labor is an important aspect for humans’ self-actualization. And that, secondly, labor is essential in keeping a com- munity together. These characteristics gives us insight into labor in a work-free world, in other words the 4th Industrial Revolution."

The willing is to identify what historical processes would have intervened to have institutionalized a highly heterogeneous distribution of welfare in the territory.  The sources of information are four: (i) the population censuses of 1908 and 1963; (ii) the agricultural censuses of 1908, 1951, 1956 and 1961; (iii) the work of historical demography; and (iv) the indices published by the General Directorate of Statistics and Censuses in 1971 and 1989. Due to the lack of a dictionary of the localities, the authors matched these sources.  The regional configuration processes analyzed here are: the departmentalization of the territory; the agriculturization; the industrialization and the balnearización. In each case, the regional and local impact of the political, economic and social transformation is analyzed. The article dedicate a wide space to describe the changes in the entity, the legal status, the territorial distribution and the wellbeing of the localities, marking especially those under 1500 inhabitants, which make up an important micro-urbanization of the country.  The foundation of 70% of the localities occurred during the reformist period that locates that project as a type of “social democratic” State with its “Bismarkian” type traits. The institutionalization of these territories is based on their precarious and very poor character, the inequality in the most elementary welfare enjoyed by the established towns and cities increases.  The processes of spatialization that reconfigured the territory during this time, contributed to the urbanization and population relocation, but in a framework in the political project of the “small model country” did not plan on the territory, the state have no special attention to correct the asymmetries in local welfare distribution structures.  We finished with the hypothesis that beyond the social advances of the “Battlista” period, the territorial inequality of opportunities has grown between 1908 and 1963 because the lack of a public planification."

From the development history of the enterprise form and the essence of the enterprise, the sole proprietorship and the partnership are essentially similar to the General Partnership and the Binghe Company in the Korean Commercial Code and the Japanese Company Code. Therefore, in the future, China can take the existing company law as a blueprint and transform individual businesses, sole proprietorships and partnerships into general partnership and joint ventures according to the different responsibilities of shareholders, on this basis, the enterprise legislation system of China is reconstructed, and the enterprises with different forms of organization are unified into the company law.

This is possible for a sign or an object does not exist independently but is born and grows in a relevant domain. In that case, Peirce’s semiotics, which is quite high in level of difficulty, becomes easier in understand and explaining, and it contributes to enhace its applicablity.Based on this idea, this research attempts to reconstruct the sign-cented Peirce’s semiotics into domain-centered semiotic relation system. Here domain means an area distinguished in its character from other ones, by which Peirce’s semiotics are formulated into a relation system. This research suggests a new point of view that sign system is a domain relation system, from domain production, development, and transformation or merging into other domain. Two new concept of domain transformation, relational framework and morphism are suggested.This research projects the anticipation that the world of semiotics can be widened if Peirce’s semiotics adapts the concept and the way of domain formulation into the realm of semiotics."

It contributed greatly to the universalization of Hangeul letters. Eongandok was published for commercial distribution and can be understood as a result of the actual conditions surrounding the Hangeul letters and the demands of the people who needed to write Hangeul letters. The composition of Eongandok based on the relationship between the sender and receiver or the subject matter of the letter, unlike the first volume influenced by existing manual for Chinese letters, the last volume seems to have embraced the universal cases of the letter. A manual book is intended to be an imitation for beginners, but for those with some experience, it is bound to be a model of utilization and transformation as a reference. Users of Eongandok may not have had much difficulty in writing letters that were not included in the table of contents, because they could properly combining or modifying the previously presented forms. There are writing manuals for the merchant in the first volume of Eongandok and for the lower classes in the last volume of enlarged Eongandok. Meanwhile, women of middle and lower class speaking Korean and writing Hangeul letters are also found in novels of the 18th century, the previous period of Eongandok. Yehyang, a maid who appears in Lee Dong-yoon’s “Yehyang”, and a daughter of middle class men who appears in Lee Ok’s “Simsaengjeon” shows that middle and lower class women had the ability to write Hangeul letters like or surpass upper class women. Through the fact that merchants, lower class people, and upper class men were being included as writers of Hangeul letters, we can see how the use of Hangeul letters were becoming more common. These mean that Eongandok is a symbolic field and way to prepare for a modern society that seeks equality between status and gender in the late Joseon Dynasty. Eongandok was also called a letter frame or a letter book. There are often traces of writing sentences in the Eongandok, which means that Eongandok had been well received by users and faithfully performed its role as manuals for letters, even in the stereotype. If research of Eongandok has been conducted in such a way as to treat Eongandok as an independent material, future research should be done with attention to the actual function and use of Eongandok, and its relationship with Hangeul letters."

Although the North Korean government strengthened various forms of control by considering this phenomenon as anti-socialist behavior that penetrated socialism, the number of people using marketplaces in every season continued to increase. Second, how fragile are the conditions for maintaining the current North Korean economic system, and the unexpected shock will affect alternatives converging into an open market system and the reconfiguration of the economy.Third, punitive regulations imposed by the North Korean government's anti-market and anti-socialist policies have an edge over policies or actions on marketization.

The 2015 revised curriculum, throughout the course of school education, sets the six core competences that students are expected to nurture and transforms teaching-learning methods from teacher-centered to student-centered. According to the 2015 Sino-Korean classics curriculum, which has been implemented since 2017, various teaching-learning methods have been continuously developed at the national level by academic societies and even teachers, but as there are very few teaching models to cultivate core competences, more teaching-learning methods are needed for the development of Sino-Korean classics education. The teaching-learning method is a method that enables learners to learn the contents of education most effectively. The teaching-learning method can maximize educational effects by using different methods according to contents of education. This study provides suggestions on Sino-Korean classics education goals and direction of development in teaching-learning methods required to accomplish core-competences presented in the 2015 Revised Sino-Korean classics curriculum which was implemented in earnest from 2017 as follows.First, it should be a teaching-learning method that can reach the educational goals and the five core competences of the 2015 revised Sino-Korean classics curriculum. The teaching-learning methods applicable to Sino-Korean classics are project learning method, discussion-debate learning method, experiential learning, and collaborative learning method, etc. Second, learner-centered cooperative teaching-learning methods should be developed. Third, as the 2015 revision curriculum is competence-oriented, learner-centered, and creative-convergence-oriented, a teaching-learning method capable of creative-convergence should be developed. Fourth, the teaching-learning method associated with the real life should be developed. It is necessary to dismiss the perception that the learning contents of Sino-Korean classics are old-fashioned and outdated, and to show that this is useful for the actual life, so that the learner is actively participating. Fifth, learning methods cooperated with other subjects should be developed. It is because the education that society needs today is aimed at cultivating talented individuals who have the ability to merge humanistic imagination with scientific creativity."

After Chinggis Khan introduced the imperial order system based on letters and documents, it became an important way for the Great Khan to wield his power and govern his state. Consequently, the Great Khan and the ruling group did not leave the management of the imperial order system absolutely in the hands of sedentary subjects, but they actively participated in it. Over time, the imperial order system became a ‘tradition’ and it survived intact in other uluses. The situation was very much the same in Qa’an Ulus based on China where sedentary cultures had bloomed from the old days. Keshig delivered the Great Khan’s oral orders to the specific office to be written, because they were able to understand the Great Khan’s word and enjoyed his great confidence. Among edicts, there were traditional ones in the Chinese style written by Hanlin Academy. However, through the Mongol Hanlin Academy, other imperial orders in a unique literal translation style were also issued in order to convey the Great Khan’s word verbatim. Furthermore, Qubilai introduced the 'Phags-pa Script, which was used for the imperial orders. Moreover, in Qa’an Ulus, seals were put on edicts as well. Then, those decrees were stored for the future. The basic structure of the imperial order remained as it was, and it was comprised of ‘Authorization’, ‘Addresser and Order Type’, ‘Addressee’, ‘Background’, ‘Text’, ‘Intimidation’, and ‘Date and Place.’ Although some changes occurred in this structure, they could be regarded as a transformation of the existing tradition.It is possible to find some influences by Uyghur, Chinese, and Islamic cultures, but it had never been changed on how to run and use it from the time of Chinggis Khan. To the Mongols, he was a symbolic person and he became a model to his descendants. Also, the imperial order system initiated by him and developed as time passed was very helpful to govern the Mongol Empire and uluses in it. Therefore, although the imperial order system did not originate from the nomadic culture, we could define it as an ‘imperial institution’ of the Mongol Empire."

Thus, this study aims at understanding Jun Takahashi’s expression characteristics through analysis of his undercover fashion works. This would be useful in seeking for the creative presentation of fashion design and the realization of innovative design value. For the research method, research review was taken about his undercover career, designing activities, and elements that gave influence on his design. The case study was also performed on female collections from 2013 F/W through 2018 F/W.Results are as follows. In the form, H-line and A-line were main frame but the harmony between deconstructive avant garde idea and practicality was proposed via deconstruction and reassembly. Modification was also sought with oversized shape and layering. As to the color and material, they were regarded to be many colors and common clothing stuff in general. Pattern, however, was featured to take diverse patterns, various graphic images, brand logo, photo image, and usage of famous artist’s works and through which themes for the season were stressed and brand’s uniqueness was presented. In addition, emphasis was put on the stage background, model appearance, performance, sound track for the season collection topics along with various props and these were used as delivery medium. This examination of undercover fashion work could be characterized as follows. First, conceptual interpretation was realized for punk mentality as negation of custom and uniformity rather than as external extremity in expression. Second, deconstructive avant garde feature was maintained and under which artistic avant garde was oriented through borrowing the artful aspect in music or artwork. Third, quality of lower street style was kept but outsider aestheticism with a high end emotion was presented by transforming the close observation of beauty inside the woman and its external expression way to the quality-oriented and sophisticated image.Designer’s willingness could be confirmed to challenge the new environment through repeating evolution towards differentiated fashion world view and this would help to pass a clue to construction of creative and unique work world down to design successors."
문화관광형시장 활성화를 위한 공공디자인 사례연구,2019,"['Cultural Tourism Type Market', 'Public Design', 'Traditional markets', 'Local Cultural Space', 'Specialized Markets', '문화관광형시장', '공공디자인', '전통시장', '지역문화공간', '특화시장']",,"(Background and Purpose)These days, the functions of the traditional market have gradually become degraded amid changes in the distribution structure and the aging of facilities. Since 2008, the Small Enterprise and Market Service (SEMAS) has pushed ahead with a project that aims to promote the cultural tourism market as part of its efforts to stimulate the traditional market. However, no standard has been established to ensure systematic improvement of the traditional market despite continuous implementation of such projects to date; therefore, the connection between the details of development and effectiveness has remained weak. In particular, the traditional market serves as a community space that reveals the historic, cultural, and local characteristics of a specific region, and for that reason, a basic course of improvement should be implemented at the public level. Thus, the purpose of this study was to present a basic course of action related to the dimensions of improvement that would need to be taken into consideration when implementing a basic plan for encouraging the cultural tourism market from the standpoint of public design by analyzing excellent domestic and overseas cases of market stimulation pursued in conjunction with cultural tourism. (Method) The cultural tourism market aims to stimulate the traditional market that has been declining by developing the cultural and tourism-related elements of various regions. Therefore, this study was conducted from the perspective of public design for increasing its value. Moreover, the concept of projects to promote the cultural tourism market and their details was investigated in advance through examination of related data and materials. Based on our examination, we identified the connections between the details of cultural tourism market promotion projects and public design elements, which was followed by modeling and a case analysis. Through these methods, the results of this study were derived in connection with the basic course of action for the area in which improvement would need to be achieved in cultural tourism markets. (Results) The cases included in the analysis, which contributed to the promotion of markets in conjunction with cultural tourism resources, were considered from the perspective of public design, which suggested that there was a convergence among infrastructures, design, and ICT. In addition, 9 types of public design elements that were derived from the preliminary study, including culture, locality, leisure value, convenience, identity, informativeness, formative artistry, symbolism, and interaction, would need to be considered when mapping a cultural tourism market plan. (Conclusion) The results of this study showed that an approach would need to be taken from the standpoint of public design to transform cultural tourism markets into cultural tourism attractions in conjunction with their unique cultures, histories, and cultural resources and that the improvement items should be structured in such a way that various cultural experiences and positive participation could be encouraged beyond simple physical improvement of the environment."
영원철학(The Perennial Philosophy)으로 본 대순사상의 궁극적 실재,2019,"['궁극적 실재', '프랙털', '홀론', '대순사상', '영원철학', 'Ultimate Reality', 'Fractals', 'Holon', 'Daesoon Thought', 'Perennial Philosophy']","현대과학자들은 우주라는 복잡계(複雜界)에서 질서의 기본 단위 즉 프랙털(fractal)의 원리를 찾으려고 애쓰고 있다. 프랙털은 수학이나 물리학에서 주로 사용하는 용어이지만, 어떤 궁극적 실재가 다면적 양상을 나타내는 이유를 설명하는 원리로서 적합하다. 프랙털은 이미 과학계에서는 상용화된 원리로서 컴퓨터 그래픽 분야에 널리 응용된다.본고에서는 프랙털의 원리를 활용하여 대순사상에서 궁극적 실재가 구현되는 양상을 밝힌다. 대순사상에는 도, 상제, 신(신명), 무극, 태극, 천지 등 다양한 궁극적 실재들이 등장하는데, 이들 개념은 서로 회통한다. 즉 궁극적 실재가 프랙털 원리에 의해 구현된다는 사실을 밝힘으로써 궁극적 실재들의 일치ㆍ회통은 현대과학에 의해 뒷받침 되고 있음을 밝힌다.그러나 전(全)세계의 주류 종교들을 인격신교와 비(非)인격신교로 나누었을 때, 대부분의 종교들은 궁극적 실재를 초월적이며 인격적인 존재로 상정하고 있으며, 이들은 신과 인간의 관계를 프랙털[음양 프랙털, 홀론]의 관계로 상정할 수 없다. 또한 궁극적 실재를 내재적이며 비인격적인 존재로 상정하는 종교들도 홀론의 실현 정도-모든 부분과 전체의 되먹힘-에는 다소 차이를 보이고 있는데, 대순사상은 가장 직접적으로 신(신명)과 인간이 음양 프랙털의 관계임을 명시하고 있다. 즉 “신(신명)은 음(陰), 인간은 양(陽)”, “인간이 곧 신적(神的) 존재”라는 것이다. 나아가 대순사상에서는 이 궁극적 실재를 다양한 관점에서 여러 가지 개념으로 제시하고 있으며, 이들이 회통할 수 있음을 밝히고 있다.이렇듯, 우주를 홀론(홀라키)으로 파악하는 관점은 영원철학의 핵심 요지(要旨)이기도 하다. 세계의 위대한 영적 스승들, 사상가들, 철학자들, 과학자들이 채택한 보편적인 종교관 즉 영원철학에 따르면 궁극적 실재는 서로 일치하며, 인간과 신은 서로 다르지 않다. 바꿔 말해 대순사상에 나타난 궁극적 실재론의 진리성은 현대 과학과 영원철학에 의해 뒷받침 된다.","Modern scientists are trying to find the basic unit of order, fractal geometry, in the complex systems of the universe. Fractal is a term often used in mathematics or physics, it is appropriate as a principle to explain why some models of ultimate reality are represented as multifaceted. Fractals are already widely used in the field of computer graphics and as a commercial principle in the world of science.In this paper, using observations from fractal geometry, I present the embodiment of ultimate reality as understood in Daesoon Thought. There are various models of ultimate reality such as Dao (道, the way), Sangje (上帝, supreme god), Sinmyeong (神明, Gods), Mugeuk (無極, limitlessness), Taegeuk (太極, the Great Ultimate), and Cheonji (天地, heaven and earth) all of which exist in Daesoon Thought, and these concepts are mutually interrelated. In other words, by revealing the fact that ultimate reality is embodied within fractal geometry, it can be shown that concordance and transformation of various models of ultimate reality are supported by modern science.But when the major religions of the world were divided along lines of personality (personal gods) and non-personality (impersonal deities), most religions came to assume that ultimate reality was either transcendental or personal, and they could not postulate a relationship between God and humanity as Yin Yang (陰陽) fractals (Holon).In addition, religions, which assume ultimate reality as an intrinsic and impersonal being, are somewhat different in terms of their degree of Holon realization - all parts and whole restitution. Daesoon Thought most directly states that gods (deities) and human beings are in a relationship of Yin Yang fractals.In essence, “deities are Yin, and humanity is Yang” and furthermore, “human beings are divine beings.” Additionally, in the Daesoon Thought, these models of ultimate reality are presented through various concepts from various viewpoints, and they are revealed as mutually interrelated concepts.As such, point of view regarding the universe wherein Holarchy becomes a models in a key idea within perennial philosophy. According to a universalized view of religious phenomena, perennial philosophy was adopted by the world’s great spiritual teachers, thinkers, philosophers, and scientists. From this viewpoint, when ultimate reality coincides, human beings and God are no longer different.In other words, the veracity of the theory of ultimate reality that has appeared in Daesoon Thought can find support in both modern science and perennial philosophy."

In order to meet the diverse needs of the people for dispute resolution, the innovation and development of online arbitration is timely. Internet arbitration focuses on Internet business disputes and integrates the comprehensive use of electronic technology, big data, and cloud computing on the Internet platform to provide parties with convenient and efficient dispute resolution services. As a result, the “quantity” diversion of dispute cases is promoted, and the “quality” improvement of dispute resolution is realized. However, the promotion of Internet arbitration in China is not universal. It faces many obstacles, such as lack of arbitration consciousness, credit concepts and so on. The key to removing obstacles lies in the strong guarantee of law and the optimization of practical operation. Based on this, on the one hand, it is necessary to unify and perfect the overall framework of Internet arbitration through legislation, including perfecting the supporting legal system, establishing the online trust stamp system, and ensuring the service and enforcement of Internet arbitration awards. On the other hand, we need science and technology to help online platform systems and a flexible use of big data to handle case data, while standardizing the industry personnel and enhancing public awareness of arbitration. Only in this way can we effectively guarantee the effectiveness of the Internet arbitration system and promote the information development of the online arbitration institutions and the new dispute resolution mechanism."

Accordingly, scientific inquiry activities have been actively carried out at schools to cultivate the scientific inquiry ability. However, the inquiry activity conducted at the school has focused only on experiment performing and data collection. Therefore, there is a need to analyze the interactions that take place at several science process skills. In this regard, this study analyzed the types of verbal interactions that occur in the 4 process skills (i.e., observation, experimental design, experiment performing and data transformation and interpretation), and investigated how these types change as process skills. To this end, 64 science-gifted students at the sixth grade of elementary school were selected for analysis. Then, 16 groups of four students were analyzed, and the inquiry activity conducted by the students was the combustion of a candle. Inquiry activity was conducted from the end of March to the middle of April. As a result of this study, 11 models were analyzed into two patterns: 3 alienated types and 8 participatory types. The most common type was the alienated type A, in which 3 students interact with one another, while one student remains alienated from them. This result suggests that a group of 3 students is the optimal group size to reduce the number of alienated students and increase interaction. In addition, the type changed depending on the students with centrality, and there were cases which show the creation of centrality, the return of centrality, the change of centrality, and the uncertainty of centrality. Based on the findings of this study, it is expected that quantitative analysis along with the types of verbal interactions will be conducted in further research."
복합관절 조류형 비행로봇 설계 및 비행동특성분석,2019,"['articulated ornithopter', 'flying robot', 'flapping', 'kinematics', 'system identification', 'flight test']",,"This paper presents the design and flight verification of an articulated ornithopter-type flying robot that mimics the articulated wing structure of a bird. Key design parameters such as transmission angle, folding angle, and inner flapping angle were analyzed using flapping kinematics. The simulation results of the parameters were cross-compared using MATLAB and Solidworks and verified in the ground experiment facility where a motion capture camera system was equipped. The designed ornithopter-type flying robot is 0.7 m long and 1.5 m wide, and the maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) is less than 300 g. To reduce weight in the manufacturing process, the skeleton was made of lightweight carbon, and the skin made of expanded polypropylene (EPP). It is important to prevent warping of the main wing for proper thrust generation while flapping, so the gears were made of high-stiffness polyether ether ketone (PEEK) and the shaft made of titanium. A small and lightweight flight control computer was used to control the longitudinal and lateral motion of the flying robot and to acquire flight data. The flapping excitation frequency matches well with the design value via fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis from the flight test. Dynamic analysis of the flying ornithopter was performed using a simplified longitudinal and lateral/directional dynamic model using stability and control derivatives from system identification method of the flight test data. The results of the parameter- optimization process demonstrate that the designed ornithopter has short-period and long-period longitudinal motion with stable but relatively low damping. Lateral/directional motion reveals slightly unstable slow dynamics and stable fast-roll modes."

The Ch.1 reviews Sarah Allan's application of the root metaphor concept to the ancient Chinese thoughts as well as the application of metaphor theory in the cognitive linguistics, that confirms the theory is valuable to study the ancient Chinese philosophy. The methodology of this essay presents a l’imagination matérielle. After analyzing several cases of the Door metaphor in The Great treatise, the Ch.2 reveals that it worked in a key logic of the text. The Ch.3 compares the nature of door space in many early Chinese texts and dictionaries, also tracks down the trace of the Chinese characters. The Ch.4 reveals it was the newest metaphor or logic that was difficult to find in previous similar texts. It also examines Lao-zi and other texts of the Huang-lao school and the Confucian, for finding something else to be. As far as I can find, The Great treatise had a similar world view with the Huang-lao school, that had proposed a trinity model of Heaven, Earth and Man. The Way and Door metaphor may be regarded as a metamorphosis of the World Tree. The Ch.5 is a conclusion: The Great treatise is able to be regarded as an important step in the transforming era of the Chinese philosophy and a creation of the new world view even, that is, to be a transition into the unique immanent world from the trisected transcendental world. Now, the human beings came to be citizens in this unique world that was in coincidentia oppositorum, not only temporal dwellers."

The point of view is the 'creative transformation(創意的 變容)' of the Shao Yong'I-ching. Yeoam first explains his theory by using 「Hado(河圖)」. This is the hallmark of Yeoam, because Shao Yong did not solve the theory with 「Hado」. So, This is his creative trait. Shao Yong used the Gailbaebeob(加一倍法) as the base material for the creation of I-ching, but I can not know that Shao Yong used Gailbaebeob for phonology. Yeoam found that Jeong-eum contained a method of Gailbaebeob, and he explained this fact in his book. As he uncovers the creation principle of Jeong-eum by Shao Yong'I-ching and makes his phonology through his book, his book can give meaning to the meaning of the phonetic lesson that the phonology and I-ching are fully integrated in Choson.Yeoam creatively adapted Shao Yong's theory to create Choson's own phonograph(音韻圖). He also invented the unique phonetic mathematics(聲音數) of Choson by converting Shao Yong'mathematics into our own style.On the other hand, it was said that the purpose of writing this book was to make a diagram of Chinese characters's phonology(漢字韻圖: Hanja Yundo) in the existing Korean language academy. However, as a result of analysis of the contents of this book, Yeoam commented on Jung-eum with the focus on the Shao Yong'I-ching, and proved that there is no problem in the representation of Chinese characters in Jeong-eum. Therefore, it was found that the writing of Hanja Yundo was not for the purpose of writing this book.'Truth of the phonology(聲音的 道)' means 'excellence(優秀性)' of a Jeong-eum's effect. 'Excellence' is a guarantee that anyone can easily learn a Jeong-eum and can express it with all kinds of letters. He stressed that Jeong-eum is a virtuous voice that can benefit the world, not merely because he has these benefits. I have also found that the character of this book has also served as the phonology of Choson and the character of Korean literature, and presented a model of fusion through creative interchange of phonology and I-ching. We concludes that this book is in line with the direction of modern discipline as 'the Creative for Convergence(創意融合)' with the rapidly changing society in the future."

As a result, scarves were produced with the motif of Jogakbo(patchwork wrapping cloth) and Jasubo(embroidery wrapping cloth), which express well about the Joseon culture and aesthetic sense in one piece of cloth as a final point of fashion wearing and frequently used gifts for foreigners. Through theoretical studies of Jogakbo and Jasubo, the composition, form, and color were examined and their symbolism and meaning were analyzed. The results of the product development are as follows. Firstly, Jogakbo and Jasubo have the beauty of simple decoration, folk art, nature (inorganic arts, unplanned planning), instinctual aesthetics (inborn aesthetic sense), economic feasibility, art of daily commodities, mind of cherishing things. They are also characterized by the aesthetics of lines and modern formative aesthetics. Secondly, with the development of the scarf inspired by Jogakbo, three scarves of 19C were used to develop the pattern of the patch as it is, or by rearranging and changing the colors according to the season. Thus, six pieces of scarves were developed. Thirdly, after modifying the size, placement, depth of the pattern of four pieces of most frequently used Jasubo, two scarves were made. New pattern is created by adjusting and mixing two pattern motifs and then seven scarves are produced through changing its placement of pattern and colors. The computerized motifs were developed into a scarf by using computer graphic programs. The study tried to reexamine the possibility and value of Korean traditional arts, especially obscure Korean cultural arts as a modern cultural commodity. In particular, in addition to using patterns as they are, they can be transformed, recombined, or graphically modernized to show the possibility of developing modern patterns while integrating the elements of tradition. If we conduct further development while utilizing these points above, we can create new cultural products by bridging the tradition and the contemporary."

As an attempt to improve the diversity of urban gardens, this study begins with collecting suitable crops for urban gardens from “Imwongyeongjeji (林園經濟志),” an encyclopedia written by Yoo-Ku Seo, a scholar in the 18-19th century. Out of those recorded in “Gwanhyuji (灌畦志),” 128 kinds of crops with linkage of the historical achievements of the realists who gave their priority to public welfare were selected and 53 crops which had traditionality, historicality, health functionality and popularity were finally selected. The properties (cold, warm, clam) of the selected crops were evenly distributed, and there was no crop that was hot and cool. In addition, the number of crops that have a sweet taste was the highest, followed by spicy and bitter, but there was no salty vegetable, which can be attributed to the fact that 12 namuls (wild vegetables) that grow in seas were excluded in this study since they were not suitable for urban gardens. Urban gardens can be transformed from those that focus on primary production and secondary consumption activities into a new resource that offers educational and traditional values by applying humanities to urban agriculture as a content resource in the era of cultural consilience and convergence. It is expected to satisfy urban residents’ intellectual and participatory needs and to enhance the diversity and utility of urban gardens by applying traditional knowledge to a new model of urban agriculture. We hope that further research will be conducted to develop new types and models of urban agriculture going forward."

Modern media users are not satisfied with a single-medium story and seek to enjoy the story they want in the way that they want. The development of the technology market and the mobile environment has laid the foundation for users to share their personal experiences to create, consume, and distribute stories through various media. A story can progress abundantly if it is a rich story. These techniques have similarities to modern machine concepts. In this study, we initially examine the characteristics of generations, which are the most important strategic factors in relation to content consumption. Technological advances and rapid generation changes also affect media devices and content. This study motivates the reader to think about the authors of modern media content based on an understanding of the rapidly changing media age. It is significant to discuss both the original and the author at this point in the creation of AI. Finally, this study describes the characteristics of media content as a modern machine concept. The modern machine concept is a broad model which holds that everything in the world can be considered as a machine, with flexibility, variability, and interactivity. The content reveals the aspects of the transformation according to the terms of access and constantly operates to enrich the story. This is analogous to a ""machinique machine,"" which works proactively. Content based on interaction moves and works by itself, and the ""mechanical machine"" operates according to the mechanical imagination, that is, via inherent dynamics during mechanical unconsciousness. This study suggests the idea of a ""mechanical machine,"" i.e., content that operates on its own, by describing cultural and social characteristics, content examples, and the modern mechanical imagination."

To this end, first, I compare Buddhism’s dependent causality (pratītyasamutpāda) and Marxism’s historicalmaterialism from the perspective of thinking methods. I note that both ideas have a common thinking method which could be named ‘thinking based on outsideness,’ which is deeply related to each idea’s criticismof substantialism and metaphysics. ‘Reasoning based on outsideness’ implies a unique concept of causality different from that of analytical causality. Second, both ideas are similar in that equality is dealt with. However, Marxism deals with class equality on the level of possibility by negating existing inequality, while Buddhism deals with ontological equality of all living beings and even that of all beings on the level of virtuality by means of Buddha-nature theory. Communism as a possible world contrasts with reality in that communism does not exist in the real world. On the other hand, Buddha-nature as the virtual contrasts with actual world, because Buddha-nature exists in reality, even though it is not actualized. Buddhist Sangha community, which is based on no-ownership and donation, can be understood as a practical model and a plan of avant-garde aiming to actualize the existential equality. This provides an important reference point for attempts trying to transform movements deferring the present life for the future into movements changing present life directly."

They have fought for their country and have kept their families safe from national crises caused by invasions of foreign countries and domestic revolts.  Jinguo heroines (heroines who wear headscarves and fight for their country), such as Hua Mulan, Mu Guiying, She Taijun, Fan Lihua, and Bao Sanniang, are characterized as individuals who are wiser, more active, courageous, and powerful than male characters and most of them are masters of martial arts and war tactics. Moreover, they would compete with men and willfully choose their own spouses and they volunteered to sacrifice their lives in the battlefield as a General or a Warrior for their families and national pride. Jinguo heroines have also fought against traitors and they sometimes criticized the incompetent government. They have been a symbol of loyalty and fidelity on the stage and welcomed by the audience for a long time. These characters are inspired by historical figures or heroines of literary works. They have been described as ‘Qinu’(奇女- outstanding, unusual woman) and ‘Lienu’(烈女- a strong-willed woman of Confucian ideals) at the same time.

Dialogue is disappearing in humanities education due to the inequality of discourse resources. As the lecturer knows but the student does not, it can be said that it is a natural thing. However, in the humanities education where dialogue disappears, humanities disappear because students are free to think and speak at their level. The inequality of discourse resources is true but exaggerated.There may be cases where questions are briefly answered. It is a step forward rather than a one-sided lecture, but it is insufficient. The lecturer makes alternative or short-answer questions to the students who lack the resources of the discourse. The reason why the lecturer is asking is to help answer the learner, but it is also because the lecturer's lecture is not distracted. The learner is afraid that the learner will be wrong even with simple questions, and the lecturer is anxious that the lecture will not be able to catch up. How can we make the lecturer's speech opinion and give the student a wing? The alternative presented by this paper is to change the lecture/learner into participant/participant in the field of humanities education. Not all humanities education needs to accept art expressions and speech, but they should not produce silent students who lack resources of discourse. For the theoretical and practical justification, I will first consider the relationship between the judgment of taste and recognition and practice in Kant's critique of judgment. (II) In this process, I will find that judgment of taste does not acquire any knowledge or norms of behavior, but it has the best sensitivity to normative and knowledge capacity. Second, I will discuss the possibility of sensationalization which is made by art experts and the general public at works of art and transformations of experience using imagination in Kant's critique of judgment. (III) Although Kant does not discuss the art creation of the public in earnest, the creation of the expert (genius) and the transformation of the experience of the public are on the same line. The educational implications will be revealed. Third, I will analyze the contribution of the literary public sphere in Habermas' description of the public sphere formation process. (Ⅳ) It will reveal the unique process of the new public emerging from the private sphere into the publicity that restrained the existing public power, especially the literary public sphere, a place of art presentation and criticism. Finally, instead of conclusions, I will present a model of art expression-speech lecture and give examples of possible areas of art. (Ⅴ) In this course, a model of art expression-speech lecture that general and non-arts lecturers can easily approach will be given."

This paper is based on the method by which Jeong Yak-yong examines the acceptance patterns of Du Bo's poems by rhyming them or simulating them. The main idea consisted of four parts. The first method is to deepen the original poem's contents using the last phrase of the original poem as its title. Through these writing techniques, Jeong Yak-yong described the original theme and contents of the poem in more detail and presented them in a variety of ways. The second method is to deliberately change the title of a poem to introduce an independent award. Jeong Yak-yong deliberately changed the title of the original poem to include his ideas in the poem. He accepted only the sanctions of ‘painting the reality’ and the contents of the poem were completely different from the original poem. The third method is to take one or two identical materials and give them new meaning. Jeong Yak-yong took only two materials, ‘The River Water’ and ‘The Seagull,’ from the poems of Du Fu. However, the implications of the two materials were completely different from those of Du Fu. The fourth method is to copy the original poem and put other contents in similar sentiments. Jeong Yak-yong wrote ‘a poem about the three farewells(三別詩)’, which were modeled after Du Fu's poem that recited three separate stories. But he made it into an original work that was completely different from Du Fu's poems. However, as the same sentiments of the two poets are melting into the poem, Jeong Yak-yong and Du Fu felt that the poems were connected across time and space.

‘새로운’ 페미니스트 운동의 등장? :〈불편한 용기〉 참여자들의 경험을 중심으로,2019,"['불편한 용기', '불법촬영', '페미니즘', '여성운동', '집합 정체성', 'Uncomfortable Courage', 'Spy cam epidemic', 'Korean women’s movement', 'feminism', 'feminist identity']","이 글은 2018년 ‘불법촬영 편파수사 규탄시위’ 〈불편한 용기〉에서 나타난 여성들의 집합적 행동의 원동력을 파악하고, 사회운동에 던지는 함의를 밝히는 것을 목적으로 한다. 구체적으로 온라인 카페이자 오프라인 집회인 〈불편한 용기〉의 참가자들을 대상으로 인터넷 에스노그라피와 심층면접, 포커스그룹 면접을 진행해 참여 동기와 과정, 집회 구성의 역동과 의미, 효과를 분석하고자 한다. ‘나의 일상은 너의 포르노가 아니다’라는 구호로 촉발된 불법촬영 문제는 2016년 ‘소라넷’ 폐지이후 〈불편한 용기〉를 거쳐 지금까지 이어졌다. 〈불편한 용기〉 참가자들은 ‘홍대 불법촬영 사건’을 계기로, 일상에서 느낀 불법촬영의 불안과 공포가 개별적으로 해소될 수 있는 것이 아님을 역설적으로 깨닫고 분노로 전환되는 경험을 한다. 이와 같은 분노는 단순히 남성중심의 사법체계에 대한 비판에서 나아가 구조적 성차별의 현실을 변화시키고자 하는 집합적 열망과 행동으로 이어졌다. 이 과정에서 특정 인물이나 집단의 헤게모니를 배제하면서 익명성이 강조되는 집회 조직과정과 현장의 특징은, 안전한 공간감각을 부여함과 동시에 누구도 되지 않고 어디에도 소속되지 않음으로써 역설적으로 모두가 연결되고 소속되는 감각을 증진시키기도 한다. 무엇보다 집회 현장에서 역동적으로 체현되는 자매애의 경험은 ‘여성’이라는 집합 정체성 형성에 영향을 미치게 되어, 이후 집회 참여를 위한 힘이 됨과 동시에 페미니스트로서 정치적 행동을 다짐하게 되는 계기가 되기도 한다. 결국 이들이 던진 불편함의 의미와 이를 해소하기 위한 용기는 보다 나은 사회를 위한 변혁적 페미니스트 운동의 자장 안에서 의미화 되어야 할 것이다.","This paper analyzes the dynamics and meanings of feminist collective action movement, particularly focusing on the “Uncomfortable Courage” protest against the spy cam epidemic. Based on online ethnography, in-depth interviews, focus group interviews and participant observations, this paper explores why young women participated the protests, how the series of protests was organized, and what its impact is. Since 2015, Korean feminists have criticized spy cam problems to lead to women’s everyday anxiety, fear, and anger, as indicating “My everyday is not your porn”. That anger accelerated in May 2018 when a female art student of Hongik University uploaded a nude image of a male model to an Internet site. She was arrested swiftly within few days and had to make public apology in front of the full glare of the media. Such a quick police action has rarely been the case for the male perpetrators before. A website called “Uncomfortable Courage” was formed and eventually served as the organizer of the massive protests at Hyehwa and Gwanghwamun. Participants of “Uncomfortable Courage” not only criticized the androcentric justice system but also demanded the transformative actions for gender equality. Such anger and requests were rooted in women’s experiences of structural gender discrimination in Korean society. While participating the protests organized through horizontal solidarity among anonymous individuals, women could develop the sense of being connected and belonging to each other. Moreover, the experience of sisterhood, which is dynamically embodied at the protest sphere, affected the formation of collective identity as ‘woman’. That becomes an empowerment for them to participating in other protests, and at the same time an opportunity to commit to further political action as a feminist."
"의례, 몸, 자아 -- 『순자(荀子)』의 수신(修身)을 중심으로",2019,"['의례', '몸', '자아', '수신', '순자', 'Rituals', 'Body', 'Self', 'Self-Cultivation', 'Xunzi']","근대 이후 다양한 철학적 흐름에서 자아에 대한 객관주의적 입장은 비판을 계속 받아왔다. 최근에는 객관주의적 자아 대신 새로운 대안으로 떠오르는 개념이 ‘변화적 자아’ 또는 ‘과정적 자아(self-in-process)’이다. 우리의 자아는 고정된 본질을 가진 실체가 아니라 역사적 우연성들 의 영향을 받으며 진화하는 자아이다. 스스로의 행위에 의해 변형되며, 따라서 경험을 통해 드러 나고 경험에 의해 변형되는 자아이다. 변화적 자아에서는 의식 대신에 ‘몸’이 중심축이다. 몸이 라는 것은 단순히 뇌와 신체를 가리키는 것은 아니며, 그것은 생리학적 심리학적 현상일 뿐만 아니라, 사유, 느낌, 욕구의 역동적 복합성이다. 이 글은 몸적 자아에 근거하여 중국 고대 철학자인 순자의 수신(修身) 개념을 분석하고자 한다. 본 논문에서는 구체적으로 세 가지 질문에 초점을 맞추고자 한다. 첫째, 순자가 왜 의례의 장 (場)으로서 몸에 집중했는가? 둘째, 인간은 몸을 통해서 어떻게 자아를 형성하고 표현하는가? 셋째, 자아는 어떻게 성장하는가? 순자가 의례의 장으로서 몸짓에 주목한 이유는 인간의 몸이 언표화되지 않는 그 이상의 것, 즉 인간의 내면의 상태를 전달할 수 있다고 믿었기 때문이다. 인간의 몸짓은 다른 의사소통 수 단보다 훨씬 더 근원적이고 직접적인 기호이다. 그리고 우리는 의례 습득을 통해 단순히 어떤 사회에서 올바르다고 승인되는 몸짓을 습득하는 데에서 그치는 것이 아니라 우리의 자아를 형 성한다. 의례 과정에서 존대와 처신의 기제를 통해 나의 자아를 표현하고 상대방의 자아를 대우 한다. 개인의 자아는 상호작용 의례를 행하는 과정에서 형성되고 실현된다. 또한 순자는 『순자』 ｢권학(勸學)｣에서 수신의 단계로 법(法)-> 류(類)-> 예(禮) 또는 통류(統類)의 과정을 제시한다. 이것은 개인이 수신을 통해 차이성-> 유사성-> 통일성의 세계로 나아가는 과정을 묘사한 것이다. 다시 말하면 수신이라는 것은 자신만의 고유한 방식을 통해 자아 정체성을 형성하는 것이기도 하지만, 동시에 개별 존재 간의 유사성, 더 나아가 통일성을 깨닫는 길이기도 하다. 그리고 이 것은 인간됨의 길이기도 하다.","Modern concept of self has been criticized because it presupposes an objective self. Therefore, a new idea of the self is suggested, that is, “self-in-process.” We do not have the constant substance, but are changed by historical contingency. We are transformed by our own actions, and are revealed by our experience. That is, we are the being to be changed by our experience. In the ideas of the self-in-process, the concept of body is one of the major elements. Our body does not simply refer to our brain and flesh, but means our physical and mental status including our thoughts, feelings, and desires. This essay aims to study an eastern idea of the self-cultivation on the basis of the somatic self. In this essay, I would like to research three issues. Frist, why does Xunzi focus on the body as the center of ritual? Second, how do humans create and express their selves by means of their body? Third, how do our selves become better? According to Xunzi, human body can express a more inner qualities than language. Human body is a more basic and direct symbol than any other communication tools. This is the reason why Xunzi focused on human body as the center of rituals. In addition, we can create our selves by learning the rituals. In particular, we can express and create our selves by the mechanism of respect and demeanor. Also, Xunzi claimed that our selves can grow by following a model, analyzing from similar cases, and realizing uniformity. In other words, human beings can create our selves by their own means of communication with others, and can be humans by moving forward from individuality and similarity to oneness at the same time."
조선 후기 미인도의 영향과 변형,2019,"['미인도', '팔도미인도', '채용신', '미인병풍', '신윤복', '사녀화', '우키요에 미인화', 'Beauty painting', 'Paldomiindo', 'Chae Yongsin', 'folding screen of Beauty painting', 'Sin Yunbok', 'Woman paintings', 'Ukiyo-e Bijin-ga']","조선 후기 미인도의 영향과 변형을 보여주는 대표적인 작품으로 OCI 미술관 소장 8폭 병풍《八道美人圖》가 있다. 물론 전대의 전통을 충분히 활용하지 못하고 완전히 도식화, 양식화된 모습을 보여 회화성은 약하나, 제재나 구성면에서 ‘무배경의 단독 기녀입상’이라는 신윤복의 〈미인도〉를 대표로 하는 조선 후기 미인도의 계보를 잇는다는 점에서 그 의미가 크다. 뿐만 아니라《팔도미인도》는 동시대 중국과 일본의 미인도에서 나타나는 경우처럼 미인도를 세트로 만들어 병풍으로 제작되었다는 점에서 조선 후기 미인도와 다른 특징도 가지고 있어 주목할 필요가 있다. 따라서 본 논문은《팔도미인도》를 중심으로 조선 후기 미인도의 영향과 변형에 대해 생각해보고자 한다. 이러한 과정을 통해서《팔도미인도》의 성격과 의의를 파악하는 것은 물론 한국과 동아시아의 회화사에서 조선 후기 미인도의 위치를 재조명해 보고자 하는 것이 본 논문의 목적이다.  春意的기녀 이미지를 그린 ‘무배경의 단독 여인입상’ 형식인 조선 후기 미인도는 총 7작품이 존재하는데,《팔도미인도》는 이들 작품들과 제재나 양식 등 여러 방면에서 공통적인 요소를 보인다. 무배경의 단독 여인입상이라는 점과 안면을 측면으로 틀어 7·8분면으로 표현했다는 점, 전체적인 포즈나 손동작, 여인의 얼굴 윤곽과 복식, 머리모양 등이 유사하다는 점에서 그 영향관계를 찾을 수 있다.  그러나《팔도미인도》는 미인도를 세트화하여 팔도 미인을 시리즈로 표현했다는 점에서는 변형된 모습을 보인다. 미인들을 세트화하여 畵冊이나 병풍으로 제작한 예는 동시대 동아시아 미인도에서도 나타난다. 중국의 경우 명 말에 여러 폭이 한 벌을 구성하는 미인도 제작이 늘어나고 특히 淸初의 궁정회화에는 12폭이 한 세트가 되는 미인도 형식이 화책이나 병풍 형식으로 제작되는 경우가 많았다. 일본의 경우도 중국 명·청시대에 보이는 절기별로 세트화된 풍속미인도가 江戶時代(1603～1868)에 성행한다. 조선의 경우도 시리즈물 혹은 세트화된 미인도가 중국에서 수입되어지거나, 국내에서 모사·모본을 떠 지속적으로 감상되어졌음을 문헌자료를 통해 확인할 수 있다. 또한 이재관의 미인도 시리즈와 같이 현존하는 예도 찾아 볼 수 있다.  한편, 미인도는 그 용도에 따라 축·첩·권·병 등으로 다양하게 粧䌙되어 제작되었다. 그 가운데 제작비용 면이나 보관에 있어서도 부담이 가장 큰 병풍 형식으로《팔도미인도》가 장황된 것은 조선 후기를 기점으로 병풍이 크게 유행했기 때문으로 보인다. 특히 19세기에 이르러 병풍이 유행한 것은 양반 의식을 갖춘 양인 계층이 증가하면서 병풍을 활용한 의례가 증가한 것과 민간의 문화가 발달하면서 실내 장식과 놀음 무대에 병풍이 활용된 것과 관련이 있다. 따라서《팔도미인도》는 미인도를 일종의 시리즈물로 세트화하여 그려왔던 한·중·일 미인도의 사례를 적용하여 집안이나 술집 및 기방 같은 공공장소의 장식이나 무대 장식용으로 사용되기 위해 병풍으로 제작되지 않았을까 싶다.","8-folding screen ‘Paldomiindo’, a collection of OCI Museum, is a representative piece which shows tradition and transformation of Korean Beauty Paintings of Late Joseon Dynasty. Even though the piece does not fully apply traditional aspect and rather shows stylization and schematization (which makes the piece to be weaker in pictoriality), its content and compositional aspect of ‘Standing painting of single Gisaeng with non-background’ continues a long pedigree of Late Joseon Dynasty’s beauty paintings. Furthermore, ‘Paldomiindo’ shares a similarity with Chinese and Japanese beauty paintings by setting a series of paintings on a folding screen. Unlike other late Joseon dynasty’s beauty painting. This piece contains such uniqueness and significance that must be examined further. Thus, this study will explore tradition and style changes of Korean beauty paintings in late Joseon dynasty along with features of ‘Paldomiindo’. This study’s objective is to reintroduce late Joseon dynasty’s beauty paintings and highlight its significances within Korean/Eastern Asian art history.  There are 7 works of beauty paintings with ‘standing painting of single woman with non-background’, and ‘Paldomiindo’ has similar aspects to these paintings with such features like materials and styles. The similarities can be listed：‘standing, single, no background drawings’, face was slightly sided(seven-tenth, eight-tenth side), an overall posture and a hand expression, outline of woman’s face and dress, and hair styles. Features mentioned above certainly shows connections between the paintings.  However, ‘Paldomiindo’ differentiates itself from the others by setting a series of paintings into one piece. Cases of collecting beauty paintings into a book and folding screeen can be found in Eastern Asia at the same period of time. In China, numbers of beauty paintings with a format of multiple pictures into one set were increased in late Ming dynasty era. In early Qing dynasty, numerous royal beauty paintings were placed on books and foldings screens with a format of 12 pictures into one set. In Japan, beauty paintings with the arrangement of multiple paintings became prevalent in Edo period(1603-1868). As these paintings were imported to Joseon, they have inspired viewers, and became models to new pieces. Meanwhile, late Joseon dynasty, the time “Paldomiindo” was made, was a time of luxurious trends and extravagant hobbies prevailing throughout society. Interests and social demands to paintings and calligraphic works grew larger in this period of time, and folding screens with paintings of various subjects became popular commodity as a result. Therefore, ‘Paldomiindo’ is created under the influences of social demands that came along with development of luxurious goods (caused by cumulated wealth of late Joseon dynasty) and trends of various subjects of paintings on folding screens. Sin Yunbok’s ‘Miindo’ began tradition of Joseon’ beauty painting, and ‘Paldomiindo’ carries the tradition to late Joseon dynasty while following prevailing styles of Eastern Asia."

The transition from an immediate unification system to a gradual peace system is becoming a realistic alternative, the form is the Koran peace community.The notion of integrated narrative in the Koran Peace Community is that the whole Korean people, including the inhabitants of the South Korea and North Korea and Corian Diaspora, resolve conflicts arising from mutual hostility and selfish desire. It can be organized into a series of process of solidarity and communication with the consciousness of community living together while acknowledging the difference in all areas of the system, emotion and culture.The development model of integrated narrative in the Koran peace community is as follows.① Building a narrative of understanding while the people of the South Korea and North Korea and Korean Diaspora have admitted their differences.② Building a common narrative while finding a point of contact in cultural elements that have enjoyed each different cultures.③ Completion of narrative of logical integration based on ethnic commonality rather than ethnic homogeneity.In the peace community, the integrated narrative must be tried in all areas of politics, economy, society, culture and scholarship. That way, the discussion about unification will become more abundant and will be able to have a complete shape.Among them, the area where the most effective contact points can be found among the inhabitants of the South Korea and North Korea is independent discourse in unification policy and a warm gaze for reunion of the South and North Korean separated families in emotional field.Such integrated narrative will contribute closely to enter into the unification system in the long run while maintaining and preserving the peace community."

This article approaches the issue in three ways.First, at the time the 3.1 and 5.4 movements emerged, immediately before and after World War I, the movements had the problem of civilizational transformation of world history as an anti-imperial movement. In this study, I will look at the development of the movements in the dimension of cross-boundary thoughts chain. This raises the question on “rewriting history” by the regime of Korea and China at the 100th anniversary of both movements. And the issue that the country takes the lead in promoting official history and orthodox theory by rewriting national history raises the necessity of writing multiple histories. It is not a post-colonization plan to rescue history from the state. It is a reconstruction of various flows of the anti-imperialist national liberation movement at that time into a chain of cross-border thought to new modernization and conversion process in Asian context.Second, I focus on the ideological mapping of China and the topology of 5.4 research today. Two years ago, Xi Jinping announced the socialist ideology with Chinese characteristics in the new era. Xi Jinping is advocating the construction of socialist modernization powers, aiming toconstruct the new world order through competing with the United States and other liberalist nations over ideology and political systems. It attempts to export the Chinese model to the third world countries. In that sense, it is important to summon 5.4 historically. It is a work that reflects on the history of modern 100 years and reveals its prospects. It inevitably reveals the landscapes of ideological rivalry and articulation.Third, this study raises issue on the implications of historical rewriting and the development of plural politics in the post-globalization era. It is no exaggeration to say that Korea and China depict the opposite phase of anti-modern modern projects. However, South Korea and China are co-ordinating with the Cold War Asian conflict and global localization in the path of heteronomous modernization and pre-modern as well. It should be accompanied by a new relationship formation path that restructure the system and create its vision. Recently, Northeast Asia has been turbulent in a multi-layered contradiction. It includes the recent denuclearization negotiations between North Korea and the United States, the trade war between China and the US, the conflict between Korea and Japan caused by Japanese economic regulations, and the struggle against the repatriation of criminals into Mainland China in Hong Kong. So how does political and economic competition and articulation in Northeast Asia work to transform the post-war regime in Asia and the world? In this study, I try to elucidate this problem in the context of the development of modern thought history in Asia."

It uses a fragmentation strategy that overturns the ‘Josin’s dream’ and weaves figures and quotes from different levels. This dream scene connects myths and history, and uses them as a symbol of the real world and history and as a symbolic model of the main narrative. However, Josin's plot and Lee's plot have the commonality of 'dream', but they are more heterogeneous than the allegorical analogy of the two. Myths and historical life clash, and mythical worldview antagonizes the historical perception of pro-Japanese activity. The extremely sensitive issue of ‘pro-Japanese’ overwhelmed the multi-layered semantic structures and mythological symbols.Lost in Namsan consists of metaphorical overlaps between ancient and modern life, trying to give the mythical aura and poetic symbolism to the familiar narrative of sacrifice and frustration of dreams of workers in the age of industrial capitalism. This play presents the dialogue of myth and modern age in which the past and the present refer to each other, reality and fantasy, and the play and reality stare at each other. However, in the way of accepting myths, rather than reinventing mythological motifs and main narrative into organic structure, it used a simple way of connecting the narratives with modern narratives through the subtitles describing myth.Taking motifs from a myth and writing a work does not simply use the myth as a material or an idea, but requires an in-depth analysis of the meaning, structure, and worldview of the myth. It is to recreate the story.The presentization of myth goes beyond the simple acceptance or transformation of myths, and includes the mythical symbols, allegory, mythological narrative structure, cyclical worldview, and archetypes in the context of narrative, so that they can be appeared in modern everyday life. It shows that myths still persist.Just as Samkukyusa contains myths, histories and fantasies, history is born from myth, history creates myth, and present life becomes one of myth someday.In other words, the presentization of myth is achieved when the work embodies that modern life is equivalent to the mythical world."
자동차 실내공간 시트디자인의 소비자 감성 특성에 관한 연구,2019,"['자동차', '실내공간', '시트디자인', '감성 특성', '설문', 'Automobile', 'Interior space', 'Sheet design', 'Emotional characteristics', 'Survey']","(연구배경 및 목적) 자동차 실내공간은 동적이며, 정적인 공간으로 오늘날 멀티미디어를 기반으로 한 자율주행 환경으로의 변화는 실내공간의 더 많은 기능을 요구하고 있고 이용자에게 매우 중요한 감성을 전달하는 다중적 공간으로 변화하고 있다. 이러한 측면에서 한국자동차산업협회의 자료에 의하면 자동차 실내공간에서 시트에 대한 소비자의 중요성이 매우 높으므로 자동차 시트디자인은 사용자의 다양한 커뮤니케이션 환경에 맞게 변화되고, 만족을 전달하는 인터렉션 디자인(Interaction Design) 측면에서 시트디자인은 변화 및 발전하여야 한다. 따라서 국내 자동차 시트디자인에 대한 세부적인 소비자의 심리적 감성 연구를 판매장에서 면담과 설문 및 통계연구를 통하여 경향에 대한 감성적 특성을 분석하고 종합하는데 연구의 목적이 있다. (연구방법) 본 연구에서는 소비자의 트랜드에 대한 특성 분석을 위하여 2010년부터 국내자동차 시장에서 판매가 가장 많은 차종과 시트 종류를 연구대상으로 하고 한국자동차산업협회의 소비자 자동차 트랜드를 조사, 분석하여 최근에 양산 및 판매되는 자동차 4사의 24종 시트를 선별하여 설문 및 통계연구를 진행하였다. 설문 및 분석 내용은 시트디자인에 있어 접근성에, 가시성, 용이성, 인지성, 안전성, 심리성에 대하여 세부적으로 설문하고 분석하였으며, 설문자료를 기반으로 통계 연구를 실시하여 각 항목 및 내용별로 유의성을 도출하여 내용을 분석, 종합하였다. (결과) 시트디자인의 접근성에 있어서는 자동차 실내의 다른 요소가 물리적 부담에 영향을 미치며, 사용 시 어깨 부위 및 옆 라인의 경사에 대한 디자인적 고려가 필요하며, 가시성에 있어서는 시트의 조작 여부가 정보적 시각기능에 영향을 미치므로 디자인 시 고려할 사항이며, 기능적 시각 반응은 형태와 컬러가 시각 반응에 많은 영향을 미치는 결과를 분석할 수 있었다. 또한 인지성에 있어서는 컬러에 대한 시각 반응은 시트의 조작과 결부되며 패턴 및 엠보와 같은 재질이 조작 및 작동에 촉각적으로 인지 반응이 높고 안전성에 있어서는 편안함이 높을수록 안전성에 대한 인식이 높고 시각적인 요소가 조작 시 관계성이 높으며, 감성적인 편안함이 높고 촉감 측면의 재질이 만족도에 영향을 미친다는 결과를 얻을 수 있었다. (결론) 향후 시트디자인에 있어서 6항목의 내용이 개발 및 디자인에 체크리스트화 되어 고려사항이 되어야 하겠으며, 자율주행 환경에서는 사용자의 감성적인 측면을 고려하여 향에 의한 후각 및 소리에 의한 청각에 영향을 주는 시트가 개발 및 디자인되고 있어 향후 오감을 통한 인지성의 극대화가 경제성에 많은 영향을 끼칠 것으로 예측된다.","(Background and Purpose) The interior space of an automobile is dynamic and static, and changes to the autonomous driving environment based on multimedia today require more interior space functionality, transforming into a multi-space that delivers important emotion to users. In this respect, according to the data of the Korea Automobile Industry Association, since sheets are given high importance by consumers in the interior space of automobiles, seat design should be altered and developed through interaction design that changes with the various communication environments of users and delivers satisfaction. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze and synthesize the emotional characteristics of trends through detailed interviews, surveys, and statistical studies of the psychological sensitivity of consumers to domestic automobile seat design. (Method) In this study, for the analysis of characteristics of consumer trends, research was conducted on the most-sold models and sheet types in the domestic automobile market since 2010, and a survey and statistical research were conducted by selecting 24 types of seats recently mass-produced and sold by four automobile companies. The survey and analysis contents were analyzed in detail in terms of accessibility, visibility, ease of use, cognition, safety, and psychology of sheet design. Statistical research was conducted based on the survey data, significance was derived for each item and content, and the contents were analyzed and synthesized. (Result) With respect to the accessibility of sheet design, other elements of automobile interiors affect physical burden, and design consideration of the shoulder slope and side line is needed when used. In terms of visibility, whether or not the seat is operated affects informational visual function, so it is considered in design. Shape and color are shown to have considerable influence on visual response. Furthermore, in terms of cognition, visual response to color is associated with seat operation, and the pattern and embossment of material is tactilely responsive to operation. In terms of safety, the higher the awareness of safety and the relationship of visual elements when the material is operated, the higher the emotional comfort and effect of the tactile aspect of the material, affecting satisfaction. (Conclusion) In the future, six items of sheet design should be checked and listed in development and design, and in the autonomous driving environment, sheets that affect hearing owing to smell and sound by considering emotional aspects of the user are being developed and designed, and it is expected that maximization of cognition through the five senses will have a great impact on economic efficiency in the future."

These researches have been focused on solving cognitive problems such as learning and problem solving related to human intelligence from the 1950s. The field of artificial intelligence has achieved more technological advance than ever, due to recent interest in technology and research on various algorithms. The knowledge-based system is a sub-domain of artificial intelligence, and it aims to enable artificial intelligence agents to make decisions by using machine-readable and processible knowledge constructed from complex and informal human knowledge and rules in various fields. A knowledge base is used to optimize information collection, organization, and retrieval, and recently it is used with statistical artificial intelligence such as machine learning. Recently, the purpose of the knowledge base is to express, publish, and share knowledge on the web by describing and connecting web resources such as pages and data. These knowledge bases are used for intelligent processing in various fields of artificial intelligence such as question answering system of the smart speaker.However, building a useful knowledge base is a time-consuming task and still requires a lot of effort of the experts. In recent years, many kinds of research and technologies of knowledge based artificial intelligence use DBpedia that is one of the biggest knowledge base aiming to extract structured content from the various information of Wikipedia. DBpedia contains various information extracted from Wikipedia such as a title, categories, and links, but the most useful knowledge is from infobox of Wikipedia that presents a summary of some unifying aspect created by users. These knowledge are created by the mapping rule between infobox structures and DBpedia ontology schema defined in DBpedia Extraction Framework. In this way, DBpedia can expect high reliability in terms of accuracy of knowledge by using the method of generating knowledge from semi-structured infobox data created by users. However, since only about 50% of all wiki pages contain infobox in Korean Wikipedia, DBpedia has limitations in term of knowledge scalability. This paper proposes a method to extract knowledge from text documents according to the ontology schema using machine learning. In order to demonstrate the appropriateness of this method, we explain a knowledge extraction model according to the DBpedia ontology schema by learning Wikipedia infoboxes. Our knowledge extraction model consists of three steps, document classification as ontology classes, proper sentence classification to extract triples, and value selection and transformation into RDF triple structure. The structure of Wikipedia infobox are defined as infobox templates that provide standardized information across related articles, and DBpedia ontology schema can be mapped these infobox templates. Based on these mapping relations, we classify the input document according to infobox categories which means ontology classes. After determining the classification of the input document, we classify the appropriate sentence according to attributes belonging to the classification. Finally, we extract knowledge from sentences that are classified as appropriate, and we convert knowledge into a form of triples. In order to train models, we generated training data set from Wikipedia dump using a method to add BIO tags to sentences, so we trained about 200 classes and about 2,500 relations for extracting knowledge. Furthermore, we evaluated comparative experiments of CRF and Bi-LSTM-CRF for the knowledge extraction process. Through this proposed process, it is possible to utilize structured knowledge by extracting knowledge according to the ontology schema fro..."
개혁주의생명신학과 기도의 신학,2019,"['개혁주의생명신학', '기도의 신학', '가슴신앙', '생명', '순종', '하나님과 대화', '선교', 'Reformed Life Theology', 'Theology of Prayer', 'Faith of the Heart', 'Life', 'Obedience', 'Dialogue with God', 'Mission']","개혁주의생명신학의 핵심은 ‘신학이 학문이 아니다.’라고 주장하는 것에서 출발한다. 장종현은 ‘신학은 학문이 아니라 생명을 살리는 복음’이라고 분명하게 말한다. 장종현은 ‘세상을 바꾸는 것은 지식이 아니라 예수의 사랑이며, 신학을 연구하는 자 모두가 예수의 인격을 닮아가야 한다.’고도 말한다. 진정한 개혁주의생명신학은 생명과 성령의 법으로 지배받는, 하나님의 형상을 닮은 기도의 사람이 되는 것이다.그러나 지금 한국교회는 기도의 위기를 맞고 있다. 그 이유는 급변하는 경제‧사회·문화와 함께 4차 산업혁명 시대의 편리성, 그리스도인들 대부분이 기도에 관하여 오해하고 있다는 점이다. 사실 기도는 하나님을 향한 믿음과 인도함을 받아 그의 뜻대로 순종하는 것이다. 이런 차원에서 개혁주의생명신학이 강조하는 기도의 신학은 ‘진리의 영’(롬 8:36)이 지배하고 생명과 성령의 법이 죄와 사망의 법에서 해방되어 거룩한 증언자로 살도록 하는 데 있다.개혁주의생명신학은 가슴신앙으로 하나님과의 깊은 대화와 성령의 이끌림을 받는 기도를 전제로 한다. 하나님을 향한 기도를 할 때 성령께서 말할 수 없는 탄식으로 우리를 향하여 간구하시기 때문이다(롬 8:26). 그리고 참된 기도만이 하나님께서 우리의 마음을 살피시고, 인간의 마음을 살피시는 이가 성령이시기 때문에 새로운 선교의 역사를 창조할 수 있다. 장종현의 기도의 신학은 ‘하나님 앞에 무릎 꿇고 받은 사명을 이룩하기 위하여 모이고 흩어지는 것’을 전제로 하는 신학이다. 이는 모이면 기도하고 흩어지면 복음을 증언하는 자로서 사명을 다하며, 성숙한 믿음을 가진 자로서 예배, 믿음, 순종, 소망을 가질 때 증언자가 됨을 의미하고 있다.기도는 우리가 어디에 있든지 하나님의 형상을 따라 만들어진 인간으로서 가치와 의미를 지니고 살도록 이끈다. 따라서 오늘의 기독교는 새로운 선교 역사를 창조하기 위해서 온 성도들에게 ‘기도의 모형’을 가르치고 제시해 주어야 한다. 개혁주의생명신학, 곧 장종현의 기도의 신학은 철저하게 말씀과 기도, 거룩한 영적 생명을 소유할 때 교육과 사회변혁, 복음의 증언자로 생명을 살리는 신학과 교회를 살리는 신학이 됨을 강조한다.","The core of the Reformed Life Theology begins with what it claims is “Theology is not learning.” Chang Jong Hyun speaks clearly that theology is not learning but life-saving Gospel. He also asserts that to change world is not knowledge but rather Jesus’ love, and all those who study theology should resemble Jesus’ character. True Reformed Life Theology is to be one who is governed by the law of the Spirit of life, and to be a person of prayer that resembles the image of God.However now, the Korean Church is facing a crisis of prayer. It was issued from convenience of the era of the fourth industrial revolution, along with the rapidly changing economic and social cultural, and from the misunderstanding of prayer held by most Christians. In fact, prayer is to obey His will by faith and guidance in God. In this aspect, theology of prayer emphasized by Reformed Life Theology is to be governed by the Spirit of Truth(Rome 8:36), to be free from the law of sin and death by the law of the Spirit of life, and to live as a holy witness.Reformed Life Theology is the faith of the heart, and presupposes a deep dialogue with God and prayer guided by the Holy Spirit. This is because the Holy Spirit begs for believers with groans that words cannot express when they pray to God(Rome 8:26). In addition, through only true prayer God examines their hearts, and new missional history can be created because the Holy Spirit examines hearts of people. Dr. Chang’s prayer theology is a theology based on the premise that “to gather and scatter to achieve the mission received after kneeling before God.” This means all believers should carry out their mission to pray when they gather, and to preach the gospel when they scatter. This signifies also they can become witnesses with mature beliefs when they have worship, faith, obedience, and hope.Prayer leads believers to live with value and meaning as beings created by the image of God wherever they are. Therefore, to create new missional history Christianity today should teach and present ‘a model of prayer’ to all believers. Reformed Life Theology, in other words Dr. Chang’s prayer theology emphasizes that theology can be a theology to save life and church as a witness of education, social transformation and the gospel when theology has exhaustively the word, prayer, and holy spiritual life."

Wayfair, Inc. 판결을 중심으로 -",2019,"['Due Process Clause', 'Dormant Commerce Clause', 'Substantial Nexus', 'Physical Presence', 'Economic Presence', '적법절차조항', '내재적 통상조항', '실질적 넥서스', '물리적 실재', '경제적 실재']","미국 연방대법원은 2018. 6. 21. South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc.에서 5(합헌) 대 4(위헌) 의견으로, 주의 역외 판매회사에 대한 판매세 징수․납부의무 부과 요건으로 물리적 실재(physical presence)가 필요하지 않다는 사우스다코타주 법률이 합헌이라는 판결을 내렸다. 연방대법원의 Wayfair 판결에 따라 미국의 개별 주는 입법을 통해서 물리적 실재, 즉 사업장과 같은 사업거점을 두지 않는 회사에 대해서도 판매세 징수․납부를 강제할 수 있게 되었다.한편, 판매세 이외에 다른 유형의 주의 세제, 특히 법인지방소득세는 이미 많은 주대법원이 무형자산의 존재 등 ‘경제적 실재’만으로 넥서스 요건을 충족한다고 판결을 내렸고 실제로 다수의 주가 경제적 넥서스 입법을 채택하였지만, Wayfair 판결을 통해서 이러한 입장을 최종적으로 확인받은 것이라고 할 수 있다. 즉, Wayfair 판결은 주의 판매세뿐만 아니라 법인지방소득세 등 주세(州稅) 넥서스 확대에도 적지 않은 영향을 미칠 것으로 생각된다.2018년의 Wayfair 판결이 1967년 Bellas Hess 판결과 1992년 Quill 판결에서 인정한 물리적 실재 원칙(physical presence rule)을 폐기하면서, 향후 연방대법원은 경제적 실재 원칙(economic presence rule)을 전제로 통상조항에 근거한 Complete Auto 기준에 따라 역외 판매회사의 사업 활동이 과세권자인 주와의 관계에서 ‘실질적 넥서스(substantial nexus)’가 인정되는 활동인지를 심사하게 될 것이다. 여기서 실질적 넥서스의 충족 요건인 “경제적 실재의 구체적 내용을 어떻게 정할 것인지”가 새로운 이슈로 등장하였다. 이는 주간 통상의 문제인 관계로 미국 연방의회가 경제적 실재 원칙의 구체적 기준을 입법화하는 방안을 고려해 볼 수 있겠으나, 연방 차원에서 조속한 입법을 기대하기는 어려울 것으로 보인다. 현재 입법 논의는 주정부 차원에서 활발하게 진행되고 있는데, Wayfair 판결의 심판대상이었던 사우스다코타주의 경제적 실재 넥서스 입법 모델이 많이 참고되고 있다.Wayfair 판결 후, 미국 각 주의 과세당국은 역외 판매회사에 대한 판매세 및 사용세 입법과 관련하여 이 역사적인 판결을 기반으로 하여 어떻게 과세 넥서스 기준을 정립할 것인가를 두고 고심하고 있다. 일명 ‘세기의 조세 사건’으로도 불리는 Wayfair 판결은 미국의 판매세 제도의 양상에 변화를 가져왔을 뿐만 아니라 미국 내 소비자에게 재화와 용역을 공급하는 외국의 온라인 판매회사에도 상당한 영향을 미칠 것으로 보이며, 우리나라 기업 또한 여기서 예외는 아니라고 할 것이다. 따라서 우리나라 기업이 미국 소비자를 대상으로 온라인 상거래를 하는 경우 미국의 어떤 주가 입법으로 역외 판매회사에 대하여 판매세 및 사용세의 징수․납부의무를 부과하고 있는지, 그리고 그와 관련한 절차는 어떠한지를 미리 고려할 필요가 있다.","On June 21, 2018, the US Supreme Court issued its opinion in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. et al., a case challenging South Dakota’s anti-Quill sales tax nexus law, in which it overturned the decades-old physical presence nexus standard required in order for a state or local government to impose a sales or use tax collection responsibility upon a remote seller. In a 5-4 decision, the Court overruled its earlier decisions in Quill and National Bellas, holding that the physical presence rule promulgated under these decisions was “unsound and incorrect.” According to Wayfair Court, “while Quill’s physical presence standard “may have seemed like a ‘clear,’ ‘bright-line test’, it now threatens to compound the arbitrary consequences that should have been apparent from the outset.” The Court supposed that it “should not maintain a rule that ignores these substantial virtual connections to the State.” The Court noted that a physical presence requirement for nexus puts retailers with physical presence in the state at a disadvantage to solely online or remote retailers. Also, the physical presence rule has limited States’ ability to seek long-term prosperity and has prevented market participants from competing on an even playing field.The US Supreme Court decision in Wayfair appears to validate South Dakota’s law and may potentially validate other state’s sales-based economic sales tax nexus laws or administrative rules that fit within the South Dakota framework. While many of these states have enjoined enforcement (or delayed the effective date) pending the outcome of Wayfair, these statutes are now arguably effective and enforceable or will be shortly after any applicable injunctions are lifted.In the Absence of Quill and Bellas Hess, the first prong of the Complete Auto test under the Commerce Clause simply asks whether the state tax applies to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State. For the Court, tax nexus is established ‘when the taxpayer avails itself of the substantial privilege of carrying on business’ in the jurisdiction. Legislative action on either federal or state level will be needed to set out the specific economic nexus rule to decide whether the nexus is clearly sufficient based on both the economic and virtual contacts a online retail sellers have with states.With the Supreme Court’s decision in Wayfair, inbound non-US companies, including those of Korea, are now faced with potential collection and filing responsibilities in states with laws similar to those of South Dakota as well as those states with provisions extending nexus to “the extent permissible under the US Constitution.” The online sellers of Korea with US customers should study and proactively respond to the legislative changes following Wayfair, as this case may potentially impact the state-level nexus determinations relative to income, gross receipt, telecome, utility and/or franchise taxes."

The effects of heat and mass transfers (double diffusion) through an oscillating disk are considered. The non-dimensional governing momentum, energy and mass equations are obtained by using the suitable non-dimensional variables. The Laplace transform method is used to obtain the exact solutions of non-dimensional velocity, temperature and concentration profiles. The expressions of skin friction, Nusselt number and Sherwood number are also presented. The numerical result for all fluid flow profiles are plotted in graphs for the different parameters studied. The results also show that, velocity for present solution (with heat and mass transfers) has a significant impact on the velocity profiles in non-coaxial rotation due to exhibits high thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity. The obtained exact solutions are found to be identical to the Guria [10]. It is worth mentioning that, the exact solutions are in excellent agreement with the numerical solutions of Inverse Laplace transform obtained by Gaver-Stehfest algorithm."

The objective of this research is to a design beam splitter that splits and focuses scattering microwaves into intense beams in multiple directions. It is difficult to split multi-beam to non-specific directions with theoretical approaches. Therefore, instead of using transformation optics(TO), which is a widely used process for controlling electromagnetic wave propagation, we used a systematic design process called the phase field design method to obtain an optimal topological structure of beam splitter. The objective function is to maximize the norm of electric field of the target areas of each direction. To avoid island structure and obtain the structure in one body, volume constraint is added to the optimization problem by using augmented Lagrangian. Target frequency is set to X-band 10GHz. The optimal beam splitter performed well in multi-beam forming and the transported electric energy of target areas improved. A frequency dependency test was conducted in the X-band to determine effective frequency range."
