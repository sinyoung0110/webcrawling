자기 공진형 무선전력전송 시스템의 효율 향상을 위한 변압기 적용 시스템 모델 분석,2019,"['Wireless Power Transfer', 'Magnetic Resonance Modeling', 'Inductive link', 'Q-factor']",,"As the mobile devices develop, the contact type wireless power transmission technologies face its limitation, and there are demands for convenient charging systems. Under the demands, non-contacting wireless power transmission system has been studied using magnetic resonance. Magnetic resonance type system uses four coils to transmit electrical power further. However, the 4-coil system has disadvantages in its size of transmission/receiving coils and difficulties in impedance matching. To improve the 4-coil system, 2-coil wireless power transmission system with transformers is proposed and analyzed. The existence of the transformers at the transmission part and the receiving part make the impedance matching between the system and the load comfortably and make the 2-coil system transmit power further. Circuit simulation is used to analyze the power transmission coefficient of the proposed 2-coil system with the 4-coil system. It can be seen through the simulation that the 2-coil wireless power transmission system with the transformers has analogous power transmission coefficient to that of the 4-coil wireless power transmission system. As a result, the wireless power transmission system can be made into a smaller size by using transformers in the 2-coil wireless power transmission system."

In this paper, APE is regarded as a multi-source translation problem in which one source is an MT output and the other is an input source sentence. So we propose a neural multi-encoder post-editing model based on the transformer. This model aims to find out the dependencies of multiple sources against their post-edited sentence separately. It then adds them to achieve the final input-output dependency. Our experiment on the WMT17 APE data shows that the multi-encoder model outperforms the basic transformer model, producing a better MT output."
The Reduction Method of a Stray Load Loss of Distribution Transformer on the Bushing Flange Plate with STS,2019,['Bushing · Stray load loss · Distribution transformer'],,"This paper deals with the stray load loss on the bushing fl ange plate of low voltage side for high effi ciency of the distribution transformer. To reduce the magnetic fl ux concentration, three models are proposed as follows. First, the basic transformer model is designed which is consisted of the windings, the core, the case and the bushing. Second transformer model is designed to creating a slit at the area where the magnetic fl ux on the bushing fl ange plate is concentrated and then attaching the STS (Stainless steel). In the third model, the bushing fl ange plate around the bushing terminal is cut into a large square shape and STS is attached. As a result of the simulations, when the material of the case is only steel, the stray load loss is 10.56 W, while the case with STS slit is 1.49 W and the case with STS plate is 0.17 W. The stray load loss reduction rate was 85.9% and 98.4% compared with the steel plate model. It is also verifi ed by the load test using the distribution transformer based on simulation data."

Although the reduction of the leakage inductance and AC resistance by applying interleaving has been well known by most designers, it is diffi cult to foresee the electrical performance of the transformer in the design stage. Based on the one-dimensional model for windings of magnetic components, this study presents a frequency dependent analytical method for leakage inductance and winding loss, which is suitable for no interleaving and interleaving winding confi gurations.Several high frequency transformer models with distinct winding arrangements are built, and the validity of the proposed method is verifi ed by comparing the FEM simulation and measurement. Other analytical methods are also compared with this new method. Results show that this method is more reliable and accurate as compared to the other analytical methods.The interleaving provides signifi cant advantage in reducing the leakage inductance and winding loss."

Il faudra alors executer cette reforme de façon individuelle et collective et n’y appliquer que la methode communautaire. Chez Ellul, la revolution consiste à reformer fondamentalement la societe. Ainsi cette revolution authentique qu’il appelle aussi ‘la revolution necessaire’ est relative à la societe et à toute la civilisation. Elle est directement liee à la technicisation et est en relation avec l’etre humain lui-meme. En somme, ‘la revolution necessaire’ consiste à se dresser contre l’État technicise et la societe technicienne. Pourtant, la rupture brusque engendree par cette revolution n’est pas possible dans notre societe moderne et la veritable conscience revolutionnaire ne peut etre trouvee dans la societe technicienne. De ce fait, il semble que la revolution ne soit plus possible et que l’espoir de ‘la revolution necessaire’ ait dispau dans la societe technicienne. Cependant l’homme peut essayer de declencher ‘la revolte’ et refuser de manière instinctive et consciente ce qui s’impose à lui-meme. C’est ainsi que les modèles revolutionnaires desuets ne sont en aucun cas efficaces dans notre societe technicienne tout à fait nouvelle, et que le seul lieu où la revolution pourrait s’effectuer, c’est dans la conscience individuelle. En effet, la revolution ne peut s’accomplir que par l’homme libre, la seule revoluion possible dans cette situation etant de ne pas s’emparer du pouvoir, mais d’orienter les techniques modernes vers la liberation de l’homme en preservant leurs cotes positifs. Grace à cette revolution, la technique pourra etre subordonnee, le système technicien en tant que système pourra etre detruit, le pouvoir de l’État pourra disparaitre, l’egalite pourra etre mise en place et la desalienation pourra cesser. Or, les caracterisques essentielles de notre temps, c’est qu’il existe un statisme profond de la civilisation en opposition avec l’ardent desir de tenter ‘la revolution necessaire’, ce qui rend impossible ‘la revolution authentique’. Si le problème fondamental n’est pas de changer de formes economiques, mais de transformer la structure de notre civilisation qui devrait etre mise en question, ce sont les Chretiens qui sont appeles à remplir ce role revolutionnaire. Ils doivent reconnaitre que leur situation est essentiellement revolutionnaire. En effet, dans notre realite, les Chretiens detiennent la force eschatologique, en raison de la mission prophetique qui leur est attribuee au moyen de leurs idees et actions, puisqu’ils sont parfaitement separes de tous les conformismes sociaux. C’est ainsi que l’esperance du retour glorieux de Jesus Christ fait que les Chretiens se retrouvent dans une situation revolutionnaire où ils peuvent faire face à la dictature technicienne. Au bout du compte, s’il y a un christianisme authentique susceptible de transformer la societe, c’est bien justement ‘le christianisme revolutionnaire’, et s’il y a des personnes capables de transformer la societe, ce sont indubitablement les Chretiens."

A broadband dielectric spectra test platform was established and an equivalent physical model of the valve side dry-type bushing of the converter transformer was developed. Different degrees of thermal aging were performed at 130 °C for 0, 4, 8, 16, and 32 days. In addition, variation of the complex permittivity and dielectric loss factors of epoxy resin impregnated paper at different temperatures and different degrees of aging was revealed. The dielectric spectra test results were fitted using the Havriliak-Negami (HN) relaxation model. The characteristic parameters were extracted, and the influences of temperature and aging on the characteristic parameters of the HN model were analyzed. The results show that in the low frequency range, temperature and aging exert greater influences on the complex permittivity. In the high frequency range, temperature and aging have smaller effect. The relaxation time and temperature satisfy the relationship of the Arrhenius equation, and the relaxation strength increases exponentially with increasing temperature. The relaxation time τ, the relaxation intensity Δε, the shape parameter α, and the shape parameter β can characterize the aging degree of paper insulation. A linear relationship between relaxation and aging times, and an exponential relationship between relaxation intensity and aging time were revealed."

The system of aged air-insulated 115 kV substation is modeled by using Alternative Transients Program- Electromagnetic Transients Program. The failed current transformer (CT) was comprehensively modeled and investigated.The comprehensive model for electrical transient simulation has been developed by using actual data and derived data from real physical dimension of equipment. The simulated results are challenged by comparison of the results from theoretical calculation according to international standard and the results from simulation including on-site measurement. The comparison results to verify the accuracy of the developed model are satisfactory. The results show that electrical stresses aff ecting CT by voltage stress exceeds CT’s 123 kV rating together with the frequent switching operations as hundreds of times per year. These lead to degradation of CT insulation, especially at the top insulation portion close to HV terminal due to nonlinear voltage distribution. Consequently, CT explosion fi nally occurred. This developed model is used as an eff ective tool for switching transient investigation to determine electrical stresses caused by various switching operations. With the known electrical stresses, the proper rating of equipment in HV substation can be selected."

Hybrid-Boost Modular Multilevel Converter-Based Medium-Voltage Multiphase Induction Motor Drive for Subsea Applications,2019,"['Five phase', 'Hybrid boost', 'Medium voltage', 'Motor drive', 'Subsea']",,"This paper proposes a hybrid-boost Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) for the Medium-Voltage (MV) Variable Speed Drives (VSDs) employed in subsea applications, such as oil and gas recovery. In the presented architecture, a hybrid-boost MMC with a reduced number of semiconductor devices driving a multiphase Induction Machine (IM) is investigated. The stepped output voltage generated by the MMC reduces or eliminates the filtering requirements. Moreover, the boosting capability of the proposed architecture eliminates the need for bulky low-frequency transformers at the converter output terminals. A detailed illustration of the hybrid-boost MMC operation, the expected limitations/constraints, and the voltage balancing technique are presented. A simulation model of the proposed MV hybrid-boost MMC-based five-phase IM drive has been built to investigate the system performance. Finally, a downscaled prototype has been constructed for experimental verification."

Analysis of Key Parameters for Inductively Coupled Power Transfer Systems Realized by Detuning Factor in Synchronous Generators,2019,"['Detuning factor', 'Efficiency', 'ICPT', 'Resonant compensation', 'Rotary transformer', 'Transfer power']",,"In this paper, a detuning factor (DeFac) method is proposed to design the key parameters for optimizing the transfer power and efficiency of an Inductively Coupled Power Transfer (ICPT) system with primary-secondary side compensation. Depending on the robustness of the system, the DeFac method can guarantee the stability of the transfer power and efficiency of an ICPT system within a certain range of resistive-capacitive or resistive-inductive loads. A MATLAB-Simulink model of a ICPT system was built to assess the system’s main evaluation criteria, namely its maximum power ratio (PR) and efficiency, in terms of different approaches. In addition, a magnetic field simulation model was built using Ansoft to specify the leakage flux and current density. Simulation results show that both the maximum PR and efficiency of the ICPT system can reach almost 70% despite the severe detuning imposed by the DeFac method. The system also exhibited low levels of leakage flux and a high current density. Experimental results confirmed the validity and feasibility of an ICPT system using DeFac-designed parameters."
