Under the demands, non-contacting wireless power transmission system has been studied using magnetic resonance. Magnetic resonance type system uses four coils to transmit electrical power further. However, the 4-coil system has disadvantages in its size of transmission/receiving coils and difficulties in impedance matching. To improve the 4-coil system, 2-coil wireless power transmission system with transformers is proposed and analyzed. The existence of the transformers at the transmission part and the receiving part make the impedance matching between the system and the load comfortably and make the 2-coil system transmit power further. Circuit simulation is used to analyze the power transmission coefficient of the proposed 2-coil system with the 4-coil system. It can be seen through the simulation that the 2-coil wireless power transmission system with the transformers has analogous power transmission coefficient to that of the 4-coil wireless power transmission system. As a result, the wireless power transmission system can be made into a smaller size by using transformers in the 2-coil wireless power transmission system."

At the same time, with the improvement of people""s awareness of environmental protection, the problem of core vibration in the operation of transformer has attracted more and more attention. The vibration of transformer core is mainly caused by magnetostriction(MS) and electromagnetic force(EF) and that the transformer corner is the concentrated reflection area is universally acknowledged. A three-dimensional model for a square ring core containing the overlap area of the corner is firstly developed and then the distribution of MS and EF and the vibration displacement caused by the two forces acting alone are calculated under normal working conditions. At the same time, the transformer may work in abnormal working conditions such as DC bias or harmonics, which will cause MS and EF to increase in varying degrees. The contribution of MS and EF to core vibration under different working conditions is analyzed and a conclusion is drawn that EF is much smaller than MS in normal working condition, but under abnormal working conditions, EF increases rapidly and should not be neglected."

To solve the above problems, this paper presents a special parameters design approach for DCT. In the proposed approach, all unknown parameters are replaced with two equivalent variables with the help of the mathematical model simplifications. Subsequently, a two-stage procedure is introduced to complete the parameters design based on the robust VCG requirement. At last, the proposed method is validated in a DCT based prototype."

The proposed smart transformer is a high-frequency power electronic transformer.

Il faudra alors executer cette reforme de façon individuelle et collective et n’y appliquer que la methode communautaire. Chez Ellul, la revolution consiste à reformer fondamentalement la societe. Ainsi cette revolution authentique qu’il appelle aussi ‘la revolution necessaire’ est relative à la societe et à toute la civilisation. Elle est directement liee à la technicisation et est en relation avec l’etre humain lui-meme. En somme, ‘la revolution necessaire’ consiste à se dresser contre l’État technicise et la societe technicienne. Pourtant, la rupture brusque engendree par cette revolution n’est pas possible dans notre societe moderne et la veritable conscience revolutionnaire ne peut etre trouvee dans la societe technicienne. De ce fait, il semble que la revolution ne soit plus possible et que l’espoir de ‘la revolution necessaire’ ait dispau dans la societe technicienne. Cependant l’homme peut essayer de declencher ‘la revolte’ et refuser de manière instinctive et consciente ce qui s’impose à lui-meme. C’est ainsi que les modèles revolutionnaires desuets ne sont en aucun cas efficaces dans notre societe technicienne tout à fait nouvelle, et que le seul lieu où la revolution pourrait s’effectuer, c’est dans la conscience individuelle. En effet, la revolution ne peut s’accomplir que par l’homme libre, la seule revoluion possible dans cette situation etant de ne pas s’emparer du pouvoir, mais d’orienter les techniques modernes vers la liberation de l’homme en preservant leurs cotes positifs. Grace à cette revolution, la technique pourra etre subordonnee, le système technicien en tant que système pourra etre detruit, le pouvoir de l’État pourra disparaitre, l’egalite pourra etre mise en place et la desalienation pourra cesser. Or, les caracterisques essentielles de notre temps, c’est qu’il existe un statisme profond de la civilisation en opposition avec l’ardent desir de tenter ‘la revolution necessaire’, ce qui rend impossible ‘la revolution authentique’. Si le problème fondamental n’est pas de changer de formes economiques, mais de transformer la structure de notre civilisation qui devrait etre mise en question, ce sont les Chretiens qui sont appeles à remplir ce role revolutionnaire. Ils doivent reconnaitre que leur situation est essentiellement revolutionnaire. En effet, dans notre realite, les Chretiens detiennent la force eschatologique, en raison de la mission prophetique qui leur est attribuee au moyen de leurs idees et actions, puisqu’ils sont parfaitement separes de tous les conformismes sociaux. C’est ainsi que l’esperance du retour glorieux de Jesus Christ fait que les Chretiens se retrouvent dans une situation revolutionnaire où ils peuvent faire face à la dictature technicienne. Au bout du compte, s’il y a un christianisme authentique susceptible de transformer la societe, c’est bien justement ‘le christianisme revolutionnaire’, et s’il y a des personnes capables de transformer la societe, ce sont indubitablement les Chretiens."

배치-적응형 공간 변형 네트워크를 이용한 도메인에 무관한 얼굴 특징점 추출,2019,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper focuses on developing a few-shot facial landmark detector that can operate on the general domain of face. Conventional methods typically used the huge amount of labeled data to perform human facial landmark detection or transferred the knowledge on the human domain to other domains. However, faces share similar geometric structure across various domains ranging from human, animals, cartoons, or even emojis. We propose domain-agnostic few-shot facial landmark detector (DAFF) that possesses both generalizability and dataefficiency. On top of model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) framework, DAFF is composed of two components: (1) batch-adaptive spatial transformer network with triangle matching loss and (2) facial landmark regressor. Batch-adaptive spatial transformer network first transforms the input image to have a common structure for each facial domain, and facial landmark regressor localizes the position of both eyes and nose. For evaluation, we repurpose LHI-Animal-Faces dataset by adding facial landmark labels on each image. Experimental results show that DAFF outperforms previous methods significantly."

High-Efficiency Bidirectional Three-Phase LCC Resonant Converter With a Wide Load Range,2019,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>This paper details the design and implementation of an efficient 4-kW bidirectional converter with a wide load range, based on a three-phase LCC resonant converter operated in a continuous conduction model, which has a number of advantages pertaining to a bidirectional power supply. The voltage boost-up function yields a high voltage gain without increasing the transformer turn ratio. The high switching frequency, which is achievable by using the soft-switching condition and multiphase operation, decreases the output ripple and helps minimize the size of the output filter, as the requirement for a filter changes after the power flow. Moreover, this reduction in the size of the filters yields economic advantages. In addition, because of the synchronous rectifier operation employed during switching, the conduction loss in the rectifier diode of the proposed converter is low. The direction of the output power can be changed easily, using phase control. The implemented power converter is connected to a 320-V rated generator on one side and 28-V lead-acid batteries on the other side. The functionality of the proposed converter is verified in experiments. We confirmed the high performance of the developed converter in terms of efficiency (92.2%), operable load range (0–12.5 A in step-up, and 0–142 A in step-down), and voltage ripple (0.05%).</P>"

To investigate the mechanism of current mismatch in response to the parasitic inductance, the circuit model of parallel-connected SiC MOSFETs is built to obtain the mathematic relationship between current difference and parasitic inductance in both dynamic and static states. Because the way of connecting the parallel-connected SiC MOSFETs with the coupled inductor in series can lead to the turn-off voltage ringing and overshoot, an improved structure is further proposed in this paper. A RCD snubber circuit is added into the proposed structure by referring to the coupled inductor with transformer in fly-back converter.

The system of aged air-insulated 115 kV substation is modeled by using Alternative Transients Program- Electromagnetic Transients Program. The failed current transformer (CT) was comprehensively modeled and investigated.The comprehensive model for electrical transient simulation has been developed by using actual data and derived data from real physical dimension of equipment. The simulated results are challenged by comparison of the results from theoretical calculation according to international standard and the results from simulation including on-site measurement. The comparison results to verify the accuracy of the developed model are satisfactory. The results show that electrical stresses aff ecting CT by voltage stress exceeds CT’s 123 kV rating together with the frequent switching operations as hundreds of times per year. These lead to degradation of CT insulation, especially at the top insulation portion close to HV terminal due to nonlinear voltage distribution. Consequently, CT explosion fi nally occurred. This developed model is used as an eff ective tool for switching transient investigation to determine electrical stresses caused by various switching operations. With the known electrical stresses, the proper rating of equipment in HV substation can be selected."

Different degrees of thermal aging were performed at 130 °C for 0, 4, 8, 16, and 32 days. In addition, variation of the complex permittivity and dielectric loss factors of epoxy resin impregnated paper at different temperatures and different degrees of aging was revealed. The dielectric spectra test results were fitted using the Havriliak-Negami (HN) relaxation model. The characteristic parameters were extracted, and the influences of temperature and aging on the characteristic parameters of the HN model were analyzed. The results show that in the low frequency range, temperature and aging exert greater influences on the complex permittivity. In the high frequency range, temperature and aging have smaller effect. The relaxation time and temperature satisfy the relationship of the Arrhenius equation, and the relaxation strength increases exponentially with increasing temperature. The relaxation time τ, the relaxation intensity Δε, the shape parameter α, and the shape parameter β can characterize the aging degree of paper insulation. A linear relationship between relaxation and aging times, and an exponential relationship between relaxation intensity and aging time were revealed."

In actual operations, due to the imbalanced loads, three-phase systems with significant single-phase loads, imbalanced power line impedance or the imbalanced short-circuit impedance of the three grid power transformer, the equivalent three-phase grid impedance is unbalanced. It is, consequently, important to develop an effective model and stability analysis method to address three-phase grid-tied inverter with unbalanced grid impedance. Traditionally, the stability of unbalanced system can be analyzed by harmonic linearization technique, however, the model derivation is complex and the controller parameters need second designing.

High efficient plasma generation in an inductively coupled plasma using a passive resonant antenna,2019,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>We developed a high efficiency plasma source in an inductively coupled discharge using a passive resonant antenna, which has the advantage that it could be retro-fitted to existing reactors with minimal change to the reactor. At the resonance, the source has a larger total equivalent resistance that is 3–18 times larger than that at the non-resonance. As the resistance increases at the fixed RF power, the RF current decreases accordingly, which indicates that the power loss in the powered antenna including the impedance matching circuits is significantly reduced.
