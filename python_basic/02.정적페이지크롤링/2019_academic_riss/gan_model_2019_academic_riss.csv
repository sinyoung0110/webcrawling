GAN을 이용한 음성 감정 인식 모델의 성능 개선,2019,"['generative adversarial network', 'speech emotion recognition', 'attention mechanism', 'BLSTM']",,"Recently, with the development of the deep learning model, the performance of the voice emotion recognition system has been improved. However, the difficulty of obtaining sufficient training data is still a deterioration factor of the performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a method to improve the performance of speech emotion recognition model by generating negative emotion data and adding negative data learning using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The proposed system consists of emotion recognition discriminator and emotion signal generator. The generator complements the learning dataset by creating negative emotion signals and negative labels. The discriminator is trained with a learning dataset that includes real and negative emotion signals. In the experiment, the IEMOCAP data set was used, and the recognition rate was compared by constructing various recognition models and it was shown that the emotion recognizer with GAN provides 1.86% more accurate prediction than the emotion recognition model using BLSTM and Attention."
A Dielectric-Modulated Normally-Off AlGaN/GaN MOSHEMT for Bio-Sensing Application: Analytical Modeling Study and Sensitivity Analysis,2019,"['2DEG', 'Gallium nitride (GaN)', 'Aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN)', 'MOSHEMT', 'Biosensor', 'TCAD']",,"This paper presents an analytical model of a bio-molecule-induced threshold voltage shift (Vth) in a normally-o AlGaN/GaN metal-oxide-semiconductor high-electron-mobility transistors (MOSHEMTs) used as bio-particle sensors. In the analytical model, the presence of biomolecules is represented by using the dielectric modulation (DM) technique for label-free electrical detection.The dielectric/semiconductor interface density-of-State (DOS)-dependent model for the density of two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) is obtained by solving a 2-D Poisson equation demonstrating required energy band diagrams. The eective capacitance in the cavity region and the threshold voltage are obtained by using dielectric modulation and the Poisson equation. Subsequently, the changes in the threshold voltage and the drain current of the device are used as the sensing metric for the detection of bio-molecules in the cavity region. Interestingly, the charge of the biomolecules can also used as a sensing parameter. The predicted sensing metric characteristics of the devel- oped analytical model are in good agreement with the result of technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations, thus conrming the validity of the proposed model."

Stage-GAN with Semantic Maps for Large-scale Image Super-resolution,2019,"['Super-resolution', 'Stage-GAN', 'Generative adversarial networks', 'Semantic maps', 'Large scaling factors']",,"Recently, the models of deep super-resolution networks can successfully learn the non-linear mapping from the low-resolution inputs to high-resolution outputs. However, for large scaling factors, this approach has difficulties in learning the relation of low-resolution to high-resolution images, which lead to the poor restoration. In this paper, we propose Stage Generative Adversarial Networks (Stage-GAN) with semantic maps for image super-resolution (SR) in large scaling factors. We decompose the task of image super-resolution into a novel semantic map based reconstruction and refinement process. In the initial stage, the semantic maps based on the given low-resolution images can be generated by Stage-0 GAN. In the next stage, the generated semantic maps from Stage-0 and corresponding low-resolution images can be used to yield high-resolution images by Stage-1 GAN. In order to remove the reconstruction artifacts and blurs for high-resolution images, Stage-2 GAN based post-processing module is proposed in the last stage, which can reconstruct high-resolution images with photo-realistic details. Extensive experiments and comparisons with other SR methods demonstrate that our proposed method can restore photo-realistic images with visual improvements. For scale factor ×8, our method performs favorably against other methods in terms of gradients similarity."
Bagging deep convolutional autoencoders trained with a mixture of real data and GAN-generated data,2019,"['representation learning', 'unsupervised learning', 'generative adversarial networks', 'deep convolutional autoencoders', 'bagging']",,"While deep neural networks have achieved remarkable performance in representation learning, a huge amount of labeled training data are usually required by supervised deep models such as convolutional neural networks. In this paper, we propose a new representation learning method, namely generative adversarial networks (GAN) based bagging deep convolutional autoencoders (GAN-BDCAE), which can map data to diverse hierarchical representations in an unsupervised fashion. To boost the size of training data, to train deep model and to aggregate diverse learning machines are the three principal avenues towards increasing the capabilities of representation learning of neural networks. We focus on combining those three techniques. To this aim, we adopt GAN for realistic unlabeled sample generation and bagging deep convolutional autoencoders (BDCAE) for robust feature learning. The proposed method improves the discriminative ability of learned feature embedding for solving subsequent pattern recognition problems. We evaluate our approach on three standard benchmarks and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to traditional unsupervised learning methods."
Game Sprite Generator Using a Multi Discriminator GAN,2019,"['Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs)', '2D Game Sprite', 'Deep Learning', 'Game Development', 'Neural Network']",,"This paper proposes an image generation method using a Multi Discriminator Generative Adversarial Net (MDGAN) as a next generation 2D game sprite creation technique. The proposed GAN is an Autoencoder-based model that receives three areas of information―color, shape, and animation, and combines them into new images. This model consists of two encoders that extract color and shape from each image, and a decoder that takes all the values of each encoder and generates an animated image. We also suggest an image processing technique during the learning process to remove the noise of the generated images. The resulting images show that 2D sprites in games can be generated by independently learning the three image attributes of shape, color, and animation. The proposed system can increase the productivity of massive 2D image modification work during the game development process. The experimental results demonstrate that our MDGAN can be used for 2D image sprite generation and modification work with little manual cost."
Optical Characteristics Comparison Between a Three-striped LED and a Conventional GaN-based LED,2019,"['LED', 'Photon extraction efficiency', 'Mean photon path length', 'Striped LED']",,"In this paper, we propose a new light-emitting diode structure with three stripes. We analyze the effect of the tapered structure of the proposed three-striped LED on photon extraction efficiency and on the mean photon path length, compared with a conventional LED structure. The effect of the absorption loss from p-metal and n-metal electrodes on photon extraction efficiency and the mean photon path length are also studied by comparing the three-striped LED with the conventional LED structure. In the three-striped LED, photon extraction efficiency is 40.7%, which is greater than the conventional gallium-nitride (GaN)-based LED, when Fresnel reflection at the semiconductor air interface is the only mechanism to prevent emitting of light."

Experimental Analysis of Equilibrization in Binary Classification for Non-Image Imbalanced Data Using Wasserstein GAN,2019,"['Wasserstein GAN', 'Over-sampling', 'Imbalanced data', 'Data augmentation methods']",,"In this paper, we explore the details of three classic data augmentation methods and two generative model based oversampling methods. The three classic data augmentation methods are random sampling (RANDOM), Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), and Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN). The two generative model based oversampling methods are Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) and Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN). In imbalanced data, the whole instances are divided into majority class and minority class, where majority class occupies most of the instances in the training set and minority class only includes a few instances. Generative models have their own advantages when they are used to generate more plausible samples referring to the distribution of the minority class. We also adopt CGAN to compare the data augmentation performance with other methods.The experimental results show that WGAN-based oversampling technique is more stable than other approaches (RANDOM, SMOTE, ADASYN and CGAN) even with the very limited training datasets.However, when the imbalanced ratio is too small, generative model based approaches cannot achieve satisfying performance than the conventional data augmentation techniques. These results suggest us one of future research directions."
Material Enhancement Model for Austenitic Stainless Steel Sheets Subjected to Pre-stretching,2019,['Austenitic stainless steel · Pre-stretching · Test · Material enhancement model · Comparison'],,"Austenitic stainless steel has considerable strain hardening property, which can be utilized in the design of cold-formed stainless steel structures to eff ectively reduce project costs. Pre-stretching is a simple and fundamental cold-forming process.Material enhancement model developed for pre-stretching lays a basis for characterizing material properties in more complicated cold-forming process(e.g. cold-rolling and press-braking). In this study, a series of material tensile tests were performed to develop material enhancement models for austenitic stainless steel sheets subjected to pre-stretching. Austenitic stainless steel sheets were tensioned in six diff erent levels to introduce cold working into the sheets. Material properties of the sheets in two directions (i.e. along and perpendicular to the pre-stretching direction) were obtained through coupon tensile tests. To facilitate the development of the material enhancement models, a simplifi ed three-stage material model with six independent parameters was proposed. Enhancement model for each material parameter was developed with the plastic strain experienced in the pre-stretching process as a key factor. Key material parameters and full-range stress–strain curves at diff erent levels of pre-stretching were generated based on the proposed and the available predictive models in literatures.Comparisons of the generated material parameters and the stress–strain curves with the test ones show good agreement."

During the course of simulation, hydrodynamic mobility model was implemented and the obtained results were used for validating the model with the previously published experimental results. Different device performance parameters are thoroughly studied for different high-K oxide materials by performing extensive simulations. It is verified that short channel effects (SCEs), key analog and RF figures of merits parameters and V th improved with an increase in the value of high-K oxide material. Moreover, it is also revealed that there is a significant growth in the values of key analog and RF figures of merits with respect to high-K values. This analysis suggested that use of a suitable value of high-K-valued oxide material in InAlN/GaN heterostructure underlap DG MOS-HEMTs can be one of the alternatives for future high speed and microwave applications."
증강현실에서의 현실감 있는 가상 모델 가시화를 위한 Texture의 생성에 관한 비교 연구,2019,"['Augmented Reality (AR)', 'Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)', 'Image Mapping', 'Unsupervised Learning', 'Visualization', '3D Model Texture']",,"The virtual model reflects the reality and gives the user a sense of understanding and immersion in the model. For example, in a shipyard, a virtual model of a digital twin can increase work productivity by giving workers an immediate view of the model of the scene. However, Augmented reality virtual models are insufficient to describe reality of real model and there is a sense of heterogeneity, which reduces the objective commitment of work model and the reality of work environment. Although many methods to give a sense of reality to texture have been studied in the past, they have been confirmed that the method using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is more efficient than other methods. GAN is a field of learning non-intelligence that can learn the image relation between two domains and transform it into a desired form. In this study, we have selected the most appropriate technique based on GAN to map the learning results to the virtual model. Based on these results, we expect to see various cases of shipbuilding marine industry using GAN."

Fake images generated using GAN(Generative Adversarial Network), one of unsupervised learning algorithms, have reached levels that are hard to discriminate from the naked eye. Detecting these fake images is required as they can be abused for crimes such as illegal content production, identity fraud  and defamation. In this paper, we develop a deep-learning model based on CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) for the detection of StyleGAN fake images. StyleGAN is one of GAN algorithms and has an excellent performance in generating face images. We experiment with 48 number of experimental scenarios developed by combining parameters of the proposed model. We train and test each scenario with 300,000 number of real and fake face images in order to present a model parameter that improves performance in the detection of fake faces."
Pix2Pix 모델을 활용한 단일 영상의 깊이맵 추출,2019,"['Deep Learning', 'Pix2Pix', 'GAN', 'Monocular Depth Map', 'Depth Map Extraction']",,"To extract the depth map from a single image, a number of CNN-based deep learning methods have been performed in recent research. In this study, the GAN structure of Pix2Pix is maintained. this model allows to converge well, because it has the structure of the generator and the discriminator. But the convolution in this model takes a long time to compute. So we change the convolution form in the generator to a depthwise convolution to improve the speed while preserving the result. Thus, the seven down-sizing convolutional hidden layers in the generator U-Net are changed to depthwise convolution. This type of convolution decreases the number of parameters, and also speeds up computation time. The proposed model shows similar depth map prediction results as in the case of the existing structure, and the computation time in case of a inference is decreased by 64%."
딥러닝 기반 교량 손상추정을 위한 Generative Adversarial Network를 이용한 가속도 데이터 생성 모델,2019,"['Generative Adversarial Network', '생성모델', '손상추정기법', '디지털 트윈', '유지관리', 'Generative Adversarial Network', 'Generative Model', 'Damage Detection', 'Digital Twin', 'Maintenance']",,"Maintenance of aging structures has attracted societal attention. Maintenance of the aging structure can be efficiently performed with a digital twin. In order to maintain the structure based on the digital twin, it is required to accurately detect the damage of the structure. Meanwhile, deep learning-based damage detection approaches have shown good performance for detecting damage of structures. However, in order to develop such deep learning-based damage detection approaches, it is necessary to use a large number of data before and after damage, but there is a problem that the amount of data before and after the damage is unbalanced in reality.In order to solve this problem, this study proposed a method based on Generative adversarial network, one of Generative Model, for generating acceleration data usually used for damage detection approaches. As results, it is confirmed that the acceleration data generated by the GAN has a very similar pattern to the acceleration generated by the simulation with structural analysis software. These results show that not only the pattern of the macroscopic data but also the frequency domain of the acceleration data can be reproduced. Therefore, these findings show that the GAN model can analyze complex acceleration data on its own, and it is thought that this data can help training of the deep learning-based damage detection approaches."

This research considers Generative Adversary Network (GAN) as a data generation method in order to overcome the imbalanced manufacturing data. While a general GAN model contributes to the generation of virtual data, several issues including the model collapsing may occur. Model collapsing is the situations that the generated data’s distribution has considerable differences with the distribution of the original data. This tendency is resulted from the objective function of a general GAN. This research proposes a new and efficient data generation framework with a modified GAN which has a correction term for decreasing gap between the generated data and the original data. The proposed method solves the data imbalance issue and the model collapsing problem simultaneously. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed framework, the real steel plate fault data with imbalances are analyzed and the results are compared with the existing the fault detection and classification methods."

Empirical results show substantial improvement to our model, e.g. about 3% in the practical dataset, thus further outperforming previous approaches, which is very critical for security-based applications."

If the fire-risk buildings can be detected, the fire authority can efficiently perform a fire service. In this paper, an autoencoder-based outlier detection technique is used to detect fire-risk buildings.Autoencoder-based outlier detection is based on the principle that the reconstruction error for normal data is low and the reconstruction error for abnormal data is high. In this paper, we propose an autoencoder model designed for high reconstruction error for abnormal data by adding Latent GAN to adversarial autoencoder. The experiments show that ‘Autoencoder with latent GAN’ is excellent at detecting fire-risk buildings."

Effect of Graphene Oxide Incorporation into Electrospun Cellulose Acetate Scaffolds on Breast Cancer Cell Culture,2019,"['Graphene oxide', 'Cellulose fibers', 'Cancer model', 'Scaffold']",,"Graphene-based nanomaterials have been used as biomaterials to enhance cell adhesion, growth, anddifferentiation. However, the effect of graphene materials on cancer cell behavior has not been thoroughly investigated.Herein, we have incorporated graphene oxide (GO) into cellulose acetate (CA) to develop nanofibrous scaffolds for in vitrocancer cell culture, which is a crucial step for drug screening and cancer research. The GO/CA scaffolds were seeded withbreast cancer cells and cell viability, proliferation, adhesion, infiltration, and morphology were assessed. Mechanicalcharacterization demonstrated that the mechanical properties of GO/CA scaffolds were significantly better than bare CAscaffold and improved with increasing GO content. More importantly, the in vitro cell studies showed that the cancer cells onGO/CA scaffolds had significantly higher viability and better cell adhesion and growth than bare CA. Our results confirm animportant role of GO in improving mechanical properties and cancer cell performance on GO/CA scaffolds. These resultssuggest the potential of the GO/CA scaffolds as a promising candidate for in vitro cancer models."
Study on Residual Stress Distributions in Press-Braked Stainless Steel Sections,2019,['Residual stress distribution model · Stainless steel · Press-braked sections · Finite element modeling'],,"The distribution of residual stresses is one of the substantial issues in determining mechanical behaviors of stainless steel structural members. Proper residual stress distribution models are necessary to include the residual stress infl uence in the analysis and design. Currently, the existing residual stress distribution model for press-braked stainless steel sections is either relatively complicated for the application, or only focuses on the longitudinal residual stress. In this study, a simplifi ed residual stress distribution model was proposed based on the analysis of the key mechanisms in the press-braking process that was assumed as two-stage (bending and rebounding) plane strain pure bending process. The stress–strain relationship was represented as a simplifi ed three–stage material model, and all the minor eff ects like the coiling and uncoiling, the material anisotropy, and the shift of neutral axis, etc. were neglected. Compared with test data, the predicted results by the proposed simplifi ed model indicate good agreement for specimens within the commonly used ratio of internal corner radius over the thickness ( r i / t ). Finite element models for the press-braking process were then developed in ABAQUS and validated using the available data from literature. A series of models with varied ratios of r i / t were analyzed. Simulation results indicate that the center of the corner region in the press-braked sections has the largest equivalent plastic strain and residual stresses. From the center to the edge, the equivalent plastic strain and residual stresses declined signifi cantly. As the ratios of r i / t become smaller and smaller, the neutral axis moves towards to the compression side and the proposed simplifi ed model gradually loses its prediction accuracy. Based on the theoretical and fi nite element analysis, the proposed simplifi ed model is applicable for press-braked stainless steel sections with r i / t ratios higher than 2.0."
Estimating TCP Flow Completion Time Distributions,2019,"['Congestion control', 'flow completion time', 'packet loss', 'packet transmission latency', 'TCP.']",,"The flow completion time is an important performancemetric for network users, and it is used in designing schedulingand congestion control algorithms. The existing TCP flow completiontime distributions are calculated from complicated models,and they are only suitable for short TCP flows. This paper is motivatedto build a simple model to derive TCP flow completion timedistribution that is suitable for both short and long TCP flows. Tobuild such a model, the distribution of the packet transmissionlatency under TCP congestion control is firstly calculated. Thepacket transmission latency is the time needed to successfully delivera packet, including the time for retransmissions due to packetlosses. Semi-Markov process is used to model the TCP congestionwindow evolution. Using the packet transmission latency distributiontogether with the TCP congestion window size information, anew parallel queueing model which describes how a file is transmittedby a TCP flow is formed. In the parallel queueing model,the flow completion time distribution is derived, and simulation resultsfrom NS2 demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed analysis."
The Relationship Between Financial Condition and Business Cycle in Mongolia,2019,"['Financial Condition Index', 'Business Cycle', 'Leading Indicator', 'Weighted-sum Approach', 'Mongolia']",,"This paper examines the interactions between financial conditions and business cycles in Mongolia, a small open economy, heavily depending on commodity exports. We construct two financial conditions indexes based on the reduced form IS model and the vector autoregression (VAR) model as surveillance tools to quantify the degree of the financial conditions. We find that real short-term interest rate and real effective exchange rate gap get a higher weight in the FCIs. Both business and financial cycles are often more pronounced in Mongolia, and financial condition is dependent of the financial and monetary policies in place. The analysis of the predictive power of the FCIs for business cycles shows that they have predictive information for the near-term economic activities. FCIs are also helpful in signaling inflation turning points."
인터랙티브 미디어 플랫폼 콕스에 제공될 4가지 얼굴 변형 기술의 비교분석,2019,"['Face Swap', 'OpenPose', 'Auto Encoder', 'Deepfake', 'Deep Learning', 'GAN', 'CyecleGAN']",,"Recently, there have been a lot of researches on the whole face replacement system, but it is not easy to obtain stable results due to various attitudes, angles and facial diversity. To produce a natural synthesis result when replacing the face shown in the video image, technologies such as face area detection, feature extraction, face alignment, face area segmentation, 3D attitude adjustment and facial transposition should all operate at a precise level. And each technology must be able to be interdependently combined. The results of our analysis show that the difficulty of implementing the technology and contribution to the system in facial replacement technology has increased in facial feature point extraction and facial alignment technology. On the other hand, the difficulty of the facial transposition technique and the three-dimensional posture adjustment technique were low, but showed the need for development. In this paper, we propose four facial replacement models such as 2-D Faceswap, OpenPose, Deekfake, and Cycle GAN, which are suitable for the Cox platform. These models have the following features; i.e. these models include a suitable model for front face pose image conversion, face pose image with active body movement, and face movement with right and left side by 15 degrees, Generative Adversarial Network."
Automatic Transformation of Korean Fonts using Unbalanced U-net and Generative Adversarial Networks,2019,"['이미지와 이미지 번역', '폰트 변환', 'GAN 손실', '복합 손실', 'image to image translation', 'typography transfer', 'GAN loss', 'compound loss']",,"In this paper, we study the typography transfer problem: transferring a source font, to an analog font with a specified style. To solve the typography transfer problem, we treat the problem as an image-to-image translation problem, and propose an unbalanced u-net architecture based on Generative Adversarial Network(GAN). Unlike traditional balanced u-net architecture, architecture we proposed consists of two subnets: (1) an unbalanced u-net is responsible for transferring specified fonts style to another, while maintaining semantic and structure information; (2) an adversarial net. Our model uses a compound loss function that includes a L1 loss, a constant loss, and a binary GAN loss to facilitate generating desired target fonts. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed network leads to more stable training loss, with faster convergence speed in cheat loss, and avoids falling into a degradation problem in generating loss than balanced u-net."

Among them, fashion designs using generation algorithms began to appear in the mid-2000s. Among generation algorithms, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a method that produces plausible samples as generation models and discriminant models competitively trained. In this paper, style transfer methods were used to create Hanbok images based on contour images of Hanbok with GAN algorithm. Style transfer is a suitable way to create hanbok with a variety of designs but no large changes of shape. In this paper, we built our own color and contour images of hanbok dataset for applying style transfer. After that, we analyzed methods and results of design using DiscoGAN, CycleGAN, and Muint, which are representative style transfer methods. As a result, all three methods learned the transformation between the color domain and the contour domain to create a new hanbok image given the contour image. In addition to the basic hanbok design, it designed creative hanbok with new patterns and color changing tie. This paper demonstrates that it is possible to design hanbok using artificial intelligence and future development possibilities."
Multiparameter optimization for the nonlinear performance improvement of centrifugal pumps using a multilayer neural network,2019,"['Artificial neural network', 'Centrifugal pump', 'Nonlinear approximate function', 'Numerical simulation', 'Particle swarm optimization']",,"To increase efficiency at the design point of a centrifugal pump, this study adopted an artificial neural network in the construction of an accurate nonlinear function between the optimization objective and the design variables of impellers. Modified particle swarm optimization was further applied to refine the mathematical model globally. The database, which consisted of 200 sets of impellers, were generated from the Latin hypercube sampling method, and their corresponding efficiencies were obtained automatically from numerical simulation. Design variables were the distributions of blade angles, and results established that the difference between the numerical performance curve and the experimental results was acceptable. Optimization with a two-layer feedforward network improved the pump efficiency at the design point by 0.454 %. Flow complexity improved as the blade curvature increased. The application of the multilayer neural network could provide a meaningful reference to single- and multi-objective optimization of complex and nonlinear pump performance."

The Cosine similarity and Cross-correlation are used to examine the similarity of synthetic ECG signals. The analysis shows that the Average Cosine similarity was 0.991 and the Average Euclidean distance similarity based on cross-correlation was 0.25: such results indicate that data size difference issue can be resolved while the generated synthetic ECG signals, similar to real ECG signals, can create synthetic data even when the registered data are not the same as the comparative data in size."
불균형 데이터 분류를 위한 딥러닝 기반 오버샘플링 기법,2019,"['불균형 데이터', 'CGAN', '딥러닝', '오버샘플링', 'Imbalanced Data', 'CGAN', 'Deep Learning', 'Over-Sampling']",,"Classification problem is to predict the class to which an input data belongs. One of the most popular methods to do this is training a machine learning algorithm using the given dataset. In this case, the dataset should have a well-balanced class distribution for the best performance. However, when the dataset has an imbalanced class distribution, its classification performance could be very poor. To overcome this problem, we propose an over-sampling scheme that balances the number of data by using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN). CGAN is a generative model developed from Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), which can learn data characteristics and generate data that is similar to real data. Therefore, CGAN can generate data of a class which has a small number of data so that the problem induced by imbalanced class distribution can be mitigated, and classification performance can be improved. Experiments using actual collected data show that the over-sampling technique using CGAN is effective and that it is superior to existing over-sampling techniques."
