GAN 모델에서 손실함수 분석,2019,[],"현재 딥러닝은 컴퓨터 분야에서 이미지 처리 방법으로 활용도가 높아지면서 딥러닝 모델 개발 연구가 활발히 진행되고 있다. 딥러닝 모델 중에서 이미지 생성모델은 대표적으로 GAN(Generative Adversarial Network, 생성적 적대 신경망) 모델을 활용하고 있다.

Stage-GAN with Semantic Maps for Large-scale Image Super-resolution,2019,"['Super-resolution', 'Stage-GAN', 'Generative adversarial networks', 'Semantic maps', 'Large scaling factors']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Recently, the models of deep super-resolution networks can successfully learn the non-linear mapping from the low-resolution inputs to high-resolution outputs. However, for large scaling factors, this approach has difficulties in learning the relation of low-resolution to high-resolution images, which lead to the poor restoration. In this paper, we propose Stage Generative Adversarial Networks (Stage-GAN) with semantic maps for image super-resolution (SR) in large scaling factors. We decompose the task of image super-resolution into a novel semantic map based reconstruction and refinement process. In the initial stage, the semantic maps based on the given low-resolution images can be generated by Stage-0 GAN. In the next stage, the generated semantic maps from Stage-0 and corresponding low-resolution images can be used to yield high-resolution images by Stage-1 GAN. In order to remove the reconstruction artifacts and blurs for high-resolution images, Stage-2 GAN based post-processing module is proposed in the last stage, which can reconstruct high-resolution images with photo-realistic details. Extensive experiments and comparisons with other SR methods demonstrate that our proposed method can restore photo-realistic images with visual improvements. For scale factor ×8, our method performs favorably against other methods in terms of gradients similarity."

To boost the size of training data, to train deep model and to aggregate diverse learning machines are the three principal avenues towards increasing the capabilities of representation learning of neural networks. We focus on combining those three techniques. To this aim, we adopt GAN for realistic unlabeled sample generation and bagging deep convolutional autoencoders (BDCAE) for robust feature learning. The proposed method improves the discriminative ability of learned feature embedding for solving subsequent pattern recognition problems. We evaluate our approach on three standard benchmarks and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to traditional unsupervised learning methods."
Game Sprite Generator Using a Multi Discriminator GAN,2019,"['Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs)', '2D Game Sprite', 'Deep Learning', 'Game Development', 'Neural Network']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper proposes an image generation method using a Multi Discriminator Generative Adversarial Net (MDGAN) as a next generation 2D game sprite creation technique. The proposed GAN is an Autoencoder-based model that receives three areas of information―color, shape, and animation, and combines them into new images. This model consists of two encoders that extract color and shape from each image, and a decoder that takes all the values of each encoder and generates an animated image. We also suggest an image processing technique during the learning process to remove the noise of the generated images. The resulting images show that 2D sprites in games can be generated by independently learning the three image attributes of shape, color, and animation. The proposed system can increase the productivity of massive 2D image modification work during the game development process. The experimental results demonstrate that our MDGAN can be used for 2D image sprite generation and modification work with little manual cost."

At such high frequencies, this paper finds that the onresistance of GaN devices may be much higher than their DC values, especially for the devices with low on-resistance. The frequency-dependent characteristics of on-resistance are studied through electrical and thermal experiments for the first time in this paper. A simplified finite-element-simulation model is proposed to illustrate the mechanism of the frequency-dependent characteristics. The results show that the frequency-dependent characteristics of the on-resistance are closely related to the current distribution inside the GaN device and affected by the layout. In addition, two same GaNbased 10MHz DC-DC converters were designed to operate under the same conditions, and the only difference comes from the layout of GaN devices. The experimental results show that the efficiency of the converter with optimized layout is improved by 2% compared to that with conventional layout."

Young’s modulus of GaN nanocolumns were measured under both compressive stress and tensile stress. It was found that the Young’s modulus decreases with the increasing of nanocolumn diameter due to the increase of face defect density. Furthermore, we measured the piezoelectric properties and found that there was a 1000-fold current increase under a strain of 1% with a fixed bias voltage of 10 mV. Based on the Schottky Barrier Diode model, we modified it with the effect of polarization charge, image charge and interface state to analyze the experiment results which reveals that the strong piezopolarization effect plays an important role in this phenomenon. Therefore, the GaN nanocolumns has a great prospect to be applied in high-efficiency nanogenerators and high-sensitivity nanosensors."

The three classic data augmentation methods are random sampling (RANDOM), Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), and Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN). The two generative model based oversampling methods are Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) and Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN). In imbalanced data, the whole instances are divided into majority class and minority class, where majority class occupies most of the instances in the training set and minority class only includes a few instances. Generative models have their own advantages when they are used to generate more plausible samples referring to the distribution of the minority class. We also adopt CGAN to compare the data augmentation performance with other methods.The experimental results show that WGAN-based oversampling technique is more stable than other approaches (RANDOM, SMOTE, ADASYN and CGAN) even with the very limited training datasets.However, when the imbalanced ratio is too small, generative model based approaches cannot achieve satisfying performance than the conventional data augmentation techniques. These results suggest us one of future research directions."

Pre-stretching is a simple and fundamental cold-forming process.Material enhancement model developed for pre-stretching lays a basis for characterizing material properties in more complicated cold-forming process(e.g. cold-rolling and press-braking). In this study, a series of material tensile tests were performed to develop material enhancement models for austenitic stainless steel sheets subjected to pre-stretching. Austenitic stainless steel sheets were tensioned in six diff erent levels to introduce cold working into the sheets. Material properties of the sheets in two directions (i.e. along and perpendicular to the pre-stretching direction) were obtained through coupon tensile tests. To facilitate the development of the material enhancement models, a simplifi ed three-stage material model with six independent parameters was proposed. Enhancement model for each material parameter was developed with the plastic strain experienced in the pre-stretching process as a key factor. Key material parameters and full-range stress–strain curves at diff erent levels of pre-stretching were generated based on the proposed and the available predictive models in literatures.Comparisons of the generated material parameters and the stress–strain curves with the test ones show good agreement."

Thus, the seven down-sizing convolutional hidden layers in the generator U-Net are changed to depthwise convolution. This type of convolution decreases the number of parameters, and also speeds up computation time.

As results, it is confirmed that the acceleration data generated by the GAN has a very similar pattern to the acceleration generated by the simulation with structural analysis software. These results show that not only the pattern of the macroscopic data but also the frequency domain of the acceleration data can be reproduced.

However, this study is a preliminary consideration before the full - scale study. In recent years, Tianxia discourse in China has emerged in a new form because of the large-scale economic growth. What we should pay more attention to in terms of humanities is that China is still regarded as a symbol of cultural ‘world’ and ‘order’ which is different from the West. However, the conditions of the 21st century make us satisfied with the imagination of ‘multiple modernities’ rather than ‘alternative’ to China as before. But even the conditions to imagine this ‘multiple modernities’ are not so easy. This is because there is a problem of how to accept the ‘external’ or ‘otherness’ experienced by China in the 20th century. In addition, the most important barometer in China is the ‘legitimacy of domination’ that enables ‘Great unity’.This study considers these two problems and dealt with the four Tianxia discourses. The four types of Tianxia discourse are ‘the Neo-Tianxiaism’(新天下主義) of Xuji Lin(許紀霖), ‘the Tianxia system’(天下體系) of ZaoTingYang(趙汀陽), the politics of ‘example’(榜樣) based on the Wangdao(王道) of Gan ChunSong(干春松), and ‘the Trans-system society’(跨體系社會) of Wang Hui(汪暉). Xu jiLin treats the tribute system based on Yì(義) rather than Lì(利) as the authority of ‘universality of sharing’. Zhao Ting Yang sees the Tianxia system as a global system and conceptualizes it with ‘Non-External(無外)’. Gan ChunSong points out that ‘example’ is variable. Wang Hui argues that China’s way of organizing the world should be a process of reforming the capitalist economic model.It is difficult to assess them easily, but it is skeptical that they can persuade the human race that has already experienced the 20th century. This is because it is unlikely to be enough to show ‘multiple modernities’ that are distinct from the Western liberal democracy. At the conclusion, I would like to propose a project of ‘self-Objectification’ and ‘expansion of people-oriented’ in China as one of the strategies to justify the Tianxia Order."
Study on Residual Stress Distributions in Press-Braked Stainless Steel Sections,2019,['Residual stress distribution model · Stainless steel · Press-braked sections · Finite element modeling'],국문 초록 정보 없음,"The distribution of residual stresses is one of the substantial issues in determining mechanical behaviors of stainless steel structural members. Proper residual stress distribution models are necessary to include the residual stress infl uence in the analysis and design. Currently, the existing residual stress distribution model for press-braked stainless steel sections is either relatively complicated for the application, or only focuses on the longitudinal residual stress. In this study, a simplifi ed residual stress distribution model was proposed based on the analysis of the key mechanisms in the press-braking process that was assumed as two-stage (bending and rebounding) plane strain pure bending process. The stress–strain relationship was represented as a simplifi ed three–stage material model, and all the minor eff ects like the coiling and uncoiling, the material anisotropy, and the shift of neutral axis, etc. were neglected. Compared with test data, the predicted results by the proposed simplifi ed model indicate good agreement for specimens within the commonly used ratio of internal corner radius over the thickness ( r i / t ). Finite element models for the press-braking process were then developed in ABAQUS and validated using the available data from literature. A series of models with varied ratios of r i / t were analyzed. Simulation results indicate that the center of the corner region in the press-braked sections has the largest equivalent plastic strain and residual stresses. From the center to the edge, the equivalent plastic strain and residual stresses declined signifi cantly. As the ratios of r i / t become smaller and smaller, the neutral axis moves towards to the compression side and the proposed simplifi ed model gradually loses its prediction accuracy. Based on the theoretical and fi nite element analysis, the proposed simplifi ed model is applicable for press-braked stainless steel sections with r i / t ratios higher than 2.0."

Tobuild such a model, the distribution of the packet transmissionlatency under TCP congestion control is firstly calculated. Thepacket transmission latency is the time needed to successfully delivera packet, including the time for retransmissions due to packetlosses. Semi-Markov process is used to model the TCP congestionwindow evolution. Using the packet transmission latency distributiontogether with the TCP congestion window size information, anew parallel queueing model which describes how a file is transmittedby a TCP flow is formed. In the parallel queueing model,the flow completion time distribution is derived, and simulation resultsfrom NS2 demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed analysis."
Stability Analysis of External Ramp Compensation on Valley V² Controlled Boost Converter,2019,"['boost converter', 'discrete iterative model', 'external ramp compensation', 'valley V² Control']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"V² control has fast transient response so it has been widely used voltage regulator modules. Although valley V² control has been proposed to control boost converter, there still exist instability issues. To stabilize instability caused by small duty or equivalent series resistance of output capacitor, external ramp compensation has been used. However, there is no reference for choosing proper ramp slope. In this paper, a discrete iterative model of valley V² controlled boost converter with external ramp compensation is established. Based on the model, bifurcation behaviors under different duty cycle and ESR are observed as equivalent ramp slope increases. The orbit of converter transfers from chaos to multi-period then to period-1, consistent with maximal Lyapunov exponent. By analyzing loci of eigenvalues, stability boundaries in different operation regions are obtained to guide equivalent ramp slope design. Experimental prototype is also built up to verify the theoretical analysis."

The analysis of the predictive power of the FCIs for business cycles shows that they have predictive information for the near-term economic activities.

Unlike traditional balanced u-net architecture, architecture we proposed consists of two subnets: (1) an unbalanced u-net is responsible for transferring specified fonts style to another, while maintaining semantic and structure information; (2) an adversarial net. Our model uses a compound loss function that includes a L1 loss, a constant loss, and a binary GAN loss to facilitate generating desired target fonts. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed network leads to more stable training loss, with faster convergence speed in cheat loss, and avoids falling into a degradation problem in generating loss than balanced u-net."

CycleGAN을 이용한 편향 테이블 데이터 (Imbalanced Table Data) 오버샘플링 (Oversampling) 문제 해결 방안에 대한 연구 : 금융사기를 중심으로,2019,"['불균형 데이터', '생성 모델', 'GAN', '오버샘플링', 'SMOTE', 'CycleGAN', 'F1', 'AUC']",현대 사회는 사람의 행동 하나가 데이터가 되며 이는 곧 엄청난 데이터의 흐름을 만든다. 20년 전 인터넷 속 전체 데이터의 양이 현대 사회속에서는 1초마다 저장된다. 이러한 추세는 앞으로 더욱 더 심화될 것이며 이러한 빅데이터를 활용하기에 따라서 엄청난 이점을 줄 수 있을 것으로 판단된다. 이러한 데이터의 분석을 위해서는 편향되지 않은 데이터가 필요한데 대부분의 빅데이터는 한쪽으로 편향인 불균형 상태며 이는 분석의 정확도를 떨어뜨리는 원인 중 하나이다. 또한 2종 오류의 비용이 큰 분야에서는 불균형 데이터를 사용한 분석을 믿을 수 없는 실정이기 때문에 이러한 문제점을 해결하는 것은 매우 중요하다. 정형 데이터 분야에서는 이러한 문제점을 해결하기 위해서 전통적인 통계 기법 방식의 오버샘플링이 발전해왔고 비정형 데이터에서는 딥러닝의 발전과 더불어 발전한 생성 모델이 불균형 문제의 해결책으로 떠올랐다. 본 연구에서는 비정형 데이터에서 오버샘플링을 하기 위해 자주 사용하는 생성 모델 중 CycleGAN을 정형 데이터에 맞게 변형시킬 것이다. 또한 GMM을 이용해 혼합 분포를 각각의 단일 분포로 분해하여 CycleGAN이 데이터의 특징을 더 잘 학습하게 만들 것이며 CycleGAN에 Classifier를 추가하여 좀 더 현실적인 데이터를 만드는 오버샘플링 기법을 만들고자 한다. 본 논문에서 제안하고자하는 오버샘플링 기법을 실험하기 위해 실제 금융사기에 관한 데이터를 PCA로 변조하여 개인정보를 가린 불균형 데이터를 사용할 것이다.,다국어 초록 정보 없음
Analysis of MHz 380V-12V DCX with low FoM device,2019,"['MHz DCX', 'Series resonant converter', 'Figure of Merit', 'ZVS']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"1MHz isolated high efficiency high power density DC/DC converter is critical for future industrial applications. The GaN devices have a better performance for such high frequency than silicon device of high breakdown voltage due to their much lower parasitic capacitance. The modeling of the primary switches conduction losses is built in this paper. Based on the model the relation between the NFoM (Rdson⋅Cotr) of primary devices and conduction loss is revealed, thus the lower voltage devices with lower FoM is adopted to implemented the experimental verification. Since the equivalent NFoM is independent of the device count of series connection and is decided by single device, an inputseries output-parallel structure prototype with multiple SRC DCX cells is implemented with low voltage MOSFETs. The 380V-12Vprototype achieves a peak efficiency of 98.3% and a power density of 810W/inch3 with multiple 60V MOSFETs."
Multiparameter optimization for the nonlinear performance improvement of centrifugal pumps using a multilayer neural network,2019,"['Artificial neural network', 'Centrifugal pump', 'Nonlinear approximate function', 'Numerical simulation', 'Particle swarm optimization']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"To increase efficiency at the design point of a centrifugal pump, this study adopted an artificial neural network in the construction of an accurate nonlinear function between the optimization objective and the design variables of impellers. Modified particle swarm optimization was further applied to refine the mathematical model globally. The database, which consisted of 200 sets of impellers, were generated from the Latin hypercube sampling method, and their corresponding efficiencies were obtained automatically from numerical simulation. Design variables were the distributions of blade angles, and results established that the difference between the numerical performance curve and the experimental results was acceptable. Optimization with a two-layer feedforward network improved the pump efficiency at the design point by 0.454 %. Flow complexity improved as the blade curvature increased. The application of the multilayer neural network could provide a meaningful reference to single- and multi-objective optimization of complex and nonlinear pump performance."

Hippo signaling is intrinsically regulated during cell cycle progression by APC/C<sup>Cdh1</sup>,2019,"['LATS1/2', 'YAP/TAZ', 'Hippo signaling', 'mitotic cell cycle', 'APC/CCdh1']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Significance</B></P><P>The Hippo signaling pathway is evolutionarily conserved in the animal kingdom and plays essential roles in regulating tissue growth during development and regeneration. We have identified APC/C<SUP>Cdh1</SUP>, a core component of cell cycle control machinery, as an evolutionarily conserved and previously unknown regulator of large tumor suppressor (LATS) kinases, which critically inhibit the YAP/TAZ transcription factors in transducing Hippo signaling.

To further understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying Hippo signaling regulation, we have found that activities of core Hippo signaling components, large tumor suppressor (LATS) kinases and YAP/TAZ transcription factors, oscillate during mitotic cell cycle. We further identified that the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)<SUP>Cdh1</SUP> E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a key role governing eukaryotic cell cycle progression, intrinsically regulates Hippo signaling activities. CDH1 recognizes LATS kinases to promote their degradation and, hence, YAP/TAZ regulation by LATS phosphorylation is under cell cycle control. As a result, YAP/TAZ activities peak in G1 phase. Furthermore, we show in <I>Drosophila</I> eye and wing development that Cdh1 is required in vivo to regulate the LATS homolog Warts with a conserved mechanism. Cdh1 reduction increased Warts levels, which resulted in reduction of the eye and wing sizes in a Yorkie dependent manner.

This paper suggests a network model of GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) based on an auxiliary classifier to generate synthetic ECG signals which may address the different data size issues. The Cosine similarity and Cross-correlation are used to examine the similarity of synthetic ECG signals. The analysis shows that the Average Cosine similarity was 0.991 and the Average Euclidean distance similarity based on cross-correlation was 0.25: such results indicate that data size difference issue can be resolved while the generated synthetic ECG signals, similar to real ECG signals, can create synthetic data even when the registered data are not the same as the comparative data in size."
불균형 데이터 분류를 위한 딥러닝 기반 오버샘플링 기법,2019,"['불균형 데이터', 'CGAN', '딥러닝', '오버샘플링', 'Imbalanced Data', 'CGAN', 'Deep Learning', 'Over-Sampling']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Classification problem is to predict the class to which an input data belongs. One of the most popular methods to do this is training a machine learning algorithm using the given dataset. In this case, the dataset should have a well-balanced class distribution for the best performance. However, when the dataset has an imbalanced class distribution, its classification performance could be very poor. To overcome this problem, we propose an over-sampling scheme that balances the number of data by using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN). CGAN is a generative model developed from Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), which can learn data characteristics and generate data that is similar to real data. Therefore, CGAN can generate data of a class which has a small number of data so that the problem induced by imbalanced class distribution can be mitigated, and classification performance can be improved. Experiments using actual collected data show that the over-sampling technique using CGAN is effective and that it is superior to existing over-sampling techniques."
