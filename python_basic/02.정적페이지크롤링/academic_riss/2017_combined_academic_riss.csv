가해자와 피해자를 위한 조직세우기 - 한일 위안부 문제를 중심으로 -,2017,"['가해자', '피해자', '조직세우기', '위안부', 'Perpetrator', 'Victim', 'System constellation', 'Comfort women']","한국과 일본의 위안부 문제는 정부 당국자들끼리의 합의가 있었지만 아무 효력을 발휘하지 못하고 있다. 가족세우기를 오랫동안 실시하였던 연구자는 조직세우기를 통해 나라간의 분쟁 사건에 대한 해답도 찾을 수 있다는 생각이 있었다. Bert Hellinger가 가족세우기로 시작하였지만 조직세우기로도 발전하고 있기에 조직세우기 입장에서 이 문제를 다루고 싶었다. 총 3번의 조직세우기를 통해 위안부 문제해결과 한국과 일본이 화해의 길을 갈 것에 대한 통찰을 얻을 수 있었다. 첫째, 위안부들은 나라와 국민에게서 버림받았던 아픔이 있는데 해방된 이후에도 제대로 국민으로 인정받고, 가족으로 인정받지 못했었다는 것이다. 둘째, 돌아온 위안부들에게 유교적 윤리관으로 대하였던 것에서 여성인권의 차원으로 그들을 존중하고 사랑하는 눈으로 바라보아야 한다는 것이다. 그래서 위안부들과 한국의 지도자들, 국민들이 서로를 바라보고 같이 울 수 있는 것이 문제 해결의 출발점이라는 것이다. 셋째, 소녀상을 세우면 강하게 자신들을 합리화하거나 정당화했던 일본군인, 일본 강경파들도 힘이 약해지고 주저앉게 한다는 것이다. 여성인권의 차원에서 위안부의 옛 모습인 소녀상을 세워 성폭력, 집단폭력의 아픔이 없도록 하는 것은 가해자들과 가해자 집단들이 자신들의 아픔을 정리하도록 촉진한다. 넷째, 시대적인 상황에 따라 가해자와 피해자가 된 그들을 모두 품고 화해한 후에 함께 새로운 길을 찾아가는 길을 마련하는 것이 우리의 역할이라는 것을 알게 되었다","The Japanese Military Sexual Slavery, known as the “Comfort Women” have been settled between the governments of Korea and Japan, yet it has not make any effect. The researcher considered the possibility of attaining reconciliation through system constellation, after practicing family constellation for a long period of time. Bert Hellinger began his constellation work with family, which later progressed into system constellation. The comfort women problem has been viewed with this perspective of system constellation. Through three system constellation sessions, insightful conclusions were drawn about how the comfort women problem could be solved and the two countries can reconcile. First of all, the comfort women had been abandoned by their country and its people. Even after the country’s independence, they were not properly recognized as its people and family. The leaders of Korea and its people including the women’s own family members should view them with respect and love. Second of all, the comfort women were treated with Confucian morality. They should be treated with respect and love in consideration of female human rights. The starting point for solving this problem can be made when the comfort women, Korea’s leaders and its people can look at each other and cry together. Third of all, installing the comfort women statue will weaken the Japanese soldiers and hardliners who had rationalized their actions against the comfort women. Installing the statue will push the assailant and victim groups to deal with their troubles and pain from the past such as sexual assault and mass violence. Last of all, it is our role to embrace both groups that became assailants and victims due to the circumstances of the times, to help them reconcile and together find a new path."

the first year after colorectal surgery in the elderly,2017,"['Colorectal cancer', 'Colorectal surgery', 'Complications', 'Elderly', 'Survival']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Purpose: Surgery for colorectal malignancy is increasingly being performed in the elderly. Little is known about the impact of complications on late mortality. This study aimed to analyze whether a complicated postoperative course affects the 1-year survival in elderly patients.Methods: All consecutive patients older than 75 years of age who underwent colorectal cancer surgery between January 2009 and April 2013 were included in this study. The main outcome was mortality at 1 year after surgery. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine risk factors for a poor outcome (mortality) after survival of the early postoperative course of surgery at 1-year follow-up. Patients who died within 30 days postoperatively were excluded from analysis.Results: The early mortality rate was 6.3% (n = 15), and 2 patients died during follow-up as a result of complications after a second surgery. A total of 223 patients survived the perioperative period and were included in this study. Twenty-two patients (9.9%) died during the first year of follow-up. Stage IV disease (P = 0.002), complications of primary surgery (P = 0.016), and comorbidity (P = 0.050) were risk factors for 1-year mortality. Intensive care unit stay, reoperation and readmission were not associated with a worse 1-year outcome.Conclusion: Elderly patients with stage IV disease at the time of surgery, comorbidity, and postoperative complications are at risk for mortality during the first year after surgery. A patient-tailored approach with special attention to perioperative care should be considered in the elderly."

The ABC model is modified to include the effect of reduced effective active volume of InGaN quantum wells (QWs) and incorporated into the numerical simulation program. It is found that the droop of internal quantum efficiency (IQE) can be well explained by the effect of reduced light-emitting active volume without assuming a large Auger recombination coefficient. A simulated IQE curve with the modified ABC model is found to fit quite well with a measured efficiency curve of an InGaN LED sample when the effective active volume takes only 2.5% of the physical volume of QWs. The proposed numerical simulation model incorporating the reduced effective active volume can be advantageous for use in the modeling and simulation of InGaN LEDs for higher efficiency.

The CF$_4$ plasma treatment was performed using CF$_4$ (30 sccm) gas under a 50 W RF power and a 10 mTorr working pressure on the surface of an AlGaN layer for 30 seconds. The current of the device was decreased when the plasma treatments were used. The forward current was decreased 7$\sim$12 times, and the leakage current was decreased 95$\sim$1100 times, as well.

BeO has a higher thermal conductivity, bandgap energy, and dielectric constant than SiO2. As an electrical insulator, diamond is the only material on earth whose thermal conductivity exceeds that of BeO. Despite these advantages, there is no chemical-vapor-deposition technique for BeO-thin-film deposition, and thus, it is not used in nanoscale-semiconductor-device processing. In this study, the BeO thin films grown on a GaN substrate with a single crystal showed excellent interface and thermal stability. Transmission electron microscopy showed clear diffraction patterns, and the Raman shifts associated with soft phonon modes verified the high thermal conductivity. The X-ray scan confirmed the out-of-plane single-crystal growth direction and the in-plane, 6-fold, symmetrical wurtzite structure. Single-crystalline BeO was grown on GaN despite the large lattice mismatch, which suggested a model that accommodated the strain of hexagonal-on-hexagonal epitaxy with 5/6 and 6/7 domain matching. BeO has a good dielectric constant and good thermal conductivity, bandgap energy, and single-crystal characteristics, so it is suitable for the gate dielectric of power semiconductor devices.

In addition, the threshold voltage was shifted in a positive position and the leakage current was significantly decreased. In order to analyze the fundamental mechanisms of device degradation, we investigated the ohmic contact reliability by the transmission line model and analyzed the gate diode characteristics to estimate the diode parameters. It was found that Ti/Al/Ni/Au ohmic contact were stable and showed good thermal performance, but the Schottky contact was more sensitive to the HTS test. Failure analysis using electrical characterization of the gate diode and TEM/EDX cross-section revealed that the gate metal diffusion phenomenon was main degradation mechanism. During HTS test, Ni diffused out from the metal-semiconductor interface and Au formed a Schottky contact on AlGaN layer. To suppress the gate deformation, we adopted the optimum passivation and demonstrated its effect on the device reliability. By comparing the behavior of gate during HTS test, we clarified that the optimum passivation could suppress the diffusion related degradation mechanism and increase the reliability of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs."

It was also observed that the FinFET exhibited improved noise performance with lower noise magnitude of 8.5x10(-15) A(2)/Hz when compared to the value of 8.7x10(-14)A(2)/Hz for the planar MISHFET. An intensive analysis indicated that both devices follow the carrier number fluctuation model, but the FinFET suffers much less charge trapping effect compared to the MISHFET (two orders lower charge trapping was observed). Moreover, the FinFET did not exhibit the Lorentz-like components, which explains that the depleted fin structure effectively prevents the carriers from being trapped into the underlying thick GaN buffer layer. On the other hand, the slope of the noise is 2 irrespective of drain voltage and apparently showed the Lorentz-like components, especially at high drain voltage in MISHFET device. This explains that the carrier trapping/detrapping between the 2-D electron gas channel and the GaN buffer layer is significant in MISHFET.</P>"

In this paper, we propose a deep super-resolution method based on generative adversarial networks to reconstruct a high-resolution license plate image from a low-resolution license plate image to improve the accuracy of lowresolution license plate recognition. To achieve this, we create a super-resolution model using deep residual blocks. In addition, our model uses the benefits of adversarial loss, pixel-wise loss, and perceptual loss. Adversarial loss plays a role in enabling the discriminator network to distinguish between the high-resolution image and the fake high-resolution image generated by the generator network well, while it facilitates the generator network to generate a realistic high-resolution image with the goal of fooling the discriminator network. Pixel-wise loss and perceptual loss help the generator network to reconstruct a better high-resolution image. We compare the proposed method and other state-of-the-art methods with the performance of the license plate image recognizer. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method performs well by showing that the accuracy of the lowresolutionimage is improved from 38.45 to 73.65% by the proposed method."

Pd nanostructures of various configurations, sizes, and densities are demonstrated based on the solid-state dewetting of Pd thin films and a clear distinction in the growth regimes is observed. Three growth regimes are clearly observed depending on the variation of DA, i.e., (i) the agglomeration of Pd nanoparticles, (ii) the coalescence of wiggly Pd nanostructures, and finally (iii) the growth of nanovoids and layers. Owing to the temperature-dependent dewetting process, the growth regimes are markedly shifted, resulting in the distinctive Pd nanostructures within the identical DA range. The results are discussed in conjunction with the surface diffusion, Volmer-Weber and coalescence growth model, and surface/interface energy minimization mechanism. In addition, the evolution of optical properties, emission band, and lattice properties are probed by reflectance, photoluminescence, and Raman spectroscopy, which exhibit varying spectral intensity and peak positions according to the surface morphology of Pd nanostructures.</P></▼2>"

Experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of the ITZ model on the single inclusion specimen’s strength. The model was tested for some inclusions that varied in dimension and shape. The effect of inclusion shape on the stress concentrations of the specimens was examined. The aim of this research work is to propose a simple yet accurate ITZ model to be used in the commercially available finite element software packages."

However, this model alone does not produce images or voices. So we used GAN (Generative Adversarial Nets), which is a non-biped learning, to create and restore objects. To determine the distribution of the assumed model data, we use the generative model G and the Discriminator model D to judge the probability of each case in order to distinguish whether the sample came from the training data from the actual or model G Respectively. This is called minimax two -player game. The model G makes a mistake maximize in order to make a mistake, and the model D makes a mistake minimize in order not to make a mistake. Model D uses technology such as recognition technology, which is a conventional prayer learning method. Through this technique, the damaged or modified objects are compared with the training sample to classify and confirm what kind of object is the first type. There is no need for another network to generate the sample through training and it will be evaluated and confirmed through experiments."

From the results of characterization active components of corni fructus, 7-O-galloyl-D-sedoheptulose is considered to play an important role in preventing and/or delaying the onset of diabetic renal damage. 7-O-Galloyl-D-sedoheptulose is expected to serve as a novel therapeutic agent against the development of diabetic nephropathy."
mir-23a regulates cardiomyocyte apoptosis by targeting manganese superoxide dismutase,2017,"['apoptosis', 'hydrogen peroxide', 'ischemia/reperfusion', 'miR-23a', 'MnSOD']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Cardiomyocyte apoptosis is initiated by various cellular insults and accumulated cardiomyocyte apoptosis leads to the pathogenesis of heart failure. Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) provoke apoptotic cascades. Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is an important antioxidant enzyme that converts cellular ROS into harmless products. In this study, we demonstrate that MnSOD is down-regulated upon hydrogen peroxide treatment or ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Enhanced expression of MnSOD attenuates cardiomyocyte apoptosis and myocardial infarction induced by I/R injury. Further, we show that miR-23a directly regulates the expression of MnSOD. miR-23a regulates cardiomyocyte apoptosis by suppressing the expression of MnSOD. Our study reveals a novel model regulating cardiomyocyte apoptosis which is composed of miR-23a and MnSOD. Our study provides a new method to tackling apoptosis related cardiac diseases."
"government domestic debt, private sector credit, and crowding out effect in oil-dependent countries",2017,"['banks', 'liquidity', 'oil-dependent', 'crowding out', 'credit']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Banks are more liquid, better capitalised, and more profitable in oil-dependent countries. However, bank credit to the private sector is relatively low as a percentage of GDP. The low level has been blamed, amongst other reasons, on governments` reliance on the banking sector to finance fiscal deficits. This study examines the crowding out effect of government domestic borrowing using a panel data model for 28 oil-dependent countries over the period 1990-2012. We estimate the model, using both fixed effects and generalised method of moments estimators and find that a one percent increase in government borrowing from domestic banks significantly decreases private sector credit by 0.22 percent and has no significant impact on the lending rate banks charge to the private sector. This finding suggests that government domestic borrowing has resulted in the shrinking of private credit and works through the credit channel and not the interest rate channel."

Those who worried most the low fertility rate were the conservatives, while the progressivists holding neo- Malthusian view did not. Alva & Gunnar Myrdal, the spouse with social democratic inclination, published the book The Crisis in Population Problem (Kris i befolkningsfrågan) in 1934 and thereby changed fundamentally the debate terrain. They acknowledged the seriousness of the declining fertility rate, contrary to the conservatives, however, they maintained that it would be possible to raise fertility rate and improve the ‘quality of people’ by progressive family policies. The core idea of their family policy proposals was that society should take the burden of children rearing costs and should support the married working women for holding down job and running household at the same time. Justifications of Alva & Gunnar Myrdal for their family policy ideas included economic logics which can be expressed as ‘economies of scale’, ‘consumer ignorance’, ‘human capital theory’, and ‘internalization of externality’ in modern economics. The philosophical foundations of Alva & Gunnar Myrdal, in terms of their ideological orientation or value orientation, were feminism, socialism, mild nationalism, and utilitarianism. In terms of the approach to social issues, very strong rationalism is found. Especially utilitarianism and rationalism were the hardcore of their philosophy. Even though their approach can be criticized in that they pursued too much the social engineering styled rationality, their contribution should be highly acknowledged if we consider the situation of the Swedish society at that time. Alva & Gunnar Myrdal intended to use the population debate as a good chance for trying progressive social reforms, and their intention was largely realized. Substantial parts of the Swedish welfare state model are debted to the intellectual legacy of Alva & Gunnar Myrdal."

TheAlN specimens were characterized using synchrotron radiation imaging techniques. We revealed by triple-axis X-ray diffraction study that, near to the former interface, randomly distributed dislocations configured to form boundaries between similar to 0.02 degrees misoriented sub-grains (from [0001] direction). Threading dislocation structure similar to that in epitaxial GaN films was not detected. To explain these observations, a theoretical model of misfit stress relaxation near the interface is suggested.</P>"

The 21st century is the era of Nak Ja Saeng Zon (樂者生存). Every citizen has dignity and value as human beings and has the right to pursue happiness. As Aristotle emphasized, the purpose of education is to create a sustained happy life through character personality and self-realization. Since its liberation from Japan August 15th in 1945, Korean education has oriented itself towards success-oriented life under the educational idea of Hong Ik In Gan (弘益人間). It is a well-known fact that Korean education has contributed to the development of the country by creating successful individuals. However, looking at the reality of Korean education, the voices of criticism that students are increasingly becoming unhappy has been getting louder from day to day. Moreover, in spite of the fact that success-oriented teleologism of education has not only various strengths, but also fatal shortcomings. By internalizing the murderous competitive spirit and by making most of students hope that time passes as fast as possible, it has made everyone live a suicidal life. To make matters worse, most of Korean teachers are expected to become a model of happy life and have to make a good circle of happy life throughout their lives have lived the same pattern of success-oriented teleologism. Our greatest happiness does not depend on the condition of life, but is always the result of a good conscience, good health, occupation and freedom in all just pursuits. The three grand essential of happiness are : something to do, someone to love, and something to hope for. In sum, I suggest as follows : First of all, we should transform the success-oriented teleologism of education into the happiness-oriented teleologism of education as soon as possible. Secondly, we should do our best efforts to remold our educational circumstances in which all students and teachers can be happy."

In the event of understanding composition of the poetry history through the existing way, the big stream can be comprehended but it cannot be confirmed that it applies to individual works. Particularly, a new way is required for this since it has never been figured out as a single stream in late Goryeo and early Joseon. This study will try to grasp the meaning of the succession and discontinuity of the poetic tradition through the `authentic precedent` based on a model of the poet, Yu Bang-Sun in late Goryeo and early Joseon. Yu Bang-Sun inherited the genealogy of Lee Saek, Lee Sung-In, Kwon Geun, and Byeon Gye-Ryang in late Goryeo, and brought up the literary persons who are representing Seo Geo-Jeong, Lee Seung-So, Seong Gan in early Joseon. Yu Bang-Sun has actively borrowed the works of his predecessors, enough to be accused of plagiarism when creating poetry. This shows the basis of his own creation by succeeding in the poetic achievements of his predecessors. As a result of verifying through actual works, the poetic tradition borrowed by Yu Bang-Sun continued to the next generations and stopped at him. Yu Bang-Sun played the role of connecting link while the tradition of the poetry history was succeeded and discontinued. The core principle of the authentic precedent in terms of Chinese poem is ""translation"". Authentic precedent translated by Goryeo`s authors has become a `new tradition` (`Korean authentic precedent`) and enriched their creative work. The creations that were born in such way became `authentic precedent` again. The authors of Joseon made their own creations through translating this new authentic precedent. Thus, the history of Korean poetics was made up through succession and discontinuity of authentic precedent. It is desired that we will find out the context of history of Korean poetics and keep track of the succession and disconnection of the poetic tradition based on the keyword of `authentic precedent and translation` in the future."

Then, we minimize the energy consumption by searching the optimal nodes deployment for the three transmissions. Furthermore, numerical results present the optimal nodes deployment parameters for the three transmissions. Energy consumption of the three transmissions are compared under optimal nodes deployment, which shows that CB based CMISO transmission consumes less energy than SISO and DSTBC based CMISO transmissions. Meanwhile, under optimal nodes deployment, the superiorities of CB based CMISO transmission over SISO and DSTBC based CMISO transmissions can be more obvious when path-loss-factor becomes low."

Especially in the context of news reports on terrorism, the author postulates that“information channels”,“information source” and “complexity of news coverage”used in the coverage of terror are main factors in organizing television news frames. By analyzing these factors within each news framing category, the paper investigates whether or not television news reports in three nations—China, the United States, and South Korea—are neutral, and if they abide by fundamental principles of objective journalism. The results demonstrate that there are several differences in covering terror attacks in China among CCTV, CNN, and KBS. CCTV shows anti-terrorism and governmental crisis management in a China-oriented frame; it defines terror as an organizational and well-prepared“common enemy of humanity,”demands resolute confrontation, and reports rapid crisis management right after a terror act has occurred. The reporting by CNN reveals criticism of the Chinese government’s non-disclosure of information, as well as the frame of anti-terrorism and crisis management in China. KBS reports, in addition to the frame of anti-terrorism and crisis management in China, that of a sharp escalation in the Chinese state’s confrontation with Uyghurs in Xinjiang. Television news coverage by the three countries all use episodic frame-telling episodes of a specific incident. This study suggests that media news reports by political and diplomatic interests should be avoided, and those by fair and neutral principles should be oriented."
efficient swimmer detection algorithm using cnn-based svm,2017,"['Object detection', 'HOG', 'SVM', 'CNN']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In this paper, we propose a CNN-based swimmer detection algorithm. Every year, water safety accidents have been occurred frequently, and accordingly, intelligent video surveillance systems are being developed to prevent accidents. Intelligent video surveillance system is a real-time system that detects objects which users want to do. It classifies or detects objects in real-time using algorithms such as GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model), HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients), and SVM (Support Vector Machine). However, HOG has a problem that it cannot accurately detect the swimmer in a complex and dynamic environment such as a beach. In other words, there are many false positives that detect swimmers as waves and false negatives that detect waves as swimmers. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a swimmer detection algorithm using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), specialized for small object sizes, in order to detect dynamic objects and swimmers more accurately and efficiently in complex environment. The proposed CNN sets the size of the input image and the size of the filter used in the convolution operation according to the size of objects.

Globally, many companies have proposed a way to automate fuse sewing technology to solve this problem. It is necessary to fix the shoe-upper patterns before bonding the shoe-upper in the automated shoe-upper manufacturing process. We propose a method to create a path point for the adhesive application of the vision-based shoe-upper. We conducted experiments using vector images and real images. In the proposed method, the convex hull algorithm is applied to the input image to detect the shoe-upper region. Next, two center points are set in the shoe-upper region and a center line connecting the center points is detected. Then, a grid pattern is formed at regular intervals based on the direction of the center line, and the intersection of the grid pattern is detected. Finally, we removed the outlier of the intersection point of the grid pattern and the intersection points, except for the outlier, were set as the path points of the adhesive and recognized the shoe-upper pattern with 85% accuracy using a convolutional neural network (CNN)."

딥러닝을 이용한 sar영상 목표물 인식 연구 동향,2017,[],"다양한 컴퓨터 비전 문제들에서 딥러닝을 활용한 알고리즘들이 괄목할만한 성능을 보여주었고, 이에 따라서Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) 영상 목표물 인식을 위해 딥러닝 기법을 활용하는 연구들이 진행되어 왔다[1]-[5]. 본고에서는 딥러닝을 이용한 SAR영상 목표물 인식을 위한 연구 동향에 대해 조사하였다.  SAR(합성개구레이다)레이다는 짧은 파장의 Chirp 신호 같은 펄스 전자파를 대상 지역(영역)에 보내고 그 지역의 구조물 특성에 의해 결정되는 반사파를 레이다 안테나로 다시 수신하여 돌아오는 시간과 강도를 측정하여 영상을 구성하는 레이다 시스템이다. SAR 시스템은 날씨와 시간 조건에 상관없이 2차원 영상을 획득하는 것이 가능하기 때문에 주로 감시정찰 분야에 많이 활용되어 왔다.  자연영상의 경우와 달리 SAR영상은 획득과정이 매우 어렵고 시간과 비용이 많이 소요된다. 따라서, 획득된 데이터는 우리가 일반적으로 구할 수 있는 자연영상과는 비교 할 수 없을 정도로 양이 제한되어 있다. 특정 지역 및 목표물 등에 대한 SAR 데이터는 기밀사항으로 분류되어 접근이 제한되어 있는 경우가 많다.  최근 영상 인식 분야에서 괄목할 만한 성능 향상을 보인 딥러닝 기반 콘볼루션 뉴럴 네트워크(CNN: Convolution Neural Network)를 SAR 영상 분류 응용에 활용하는 연구가 활발히 진행되고 있다[1]-[5]. 기본적으로 많은 필터를 사용하여 특징 추출 및 특징 매핑, 특징 분류를 하나의 통합된 시스템에서 학습과정을 필터 파라미터 및 네트워크 연결 파라미터를 구하는 과정은 많은 훈련 데이터가 필요하다. 그러나 SAR 영상의 경우 전술한 바와 같이 영상 획득과정에 많은 비용과 시간이 소요되기 때문에 충분한 학습데이터를 확보하는 것이 매우 어렵고, 제한적인 데이터를 활용하여 CNN 기반 SAR 영상 인식 시스템을 학습하는 것은 과적합(over-fitting) 문제를 야기시킨다. SAR 영상 목표물 인식을 위하여 과적합문제를 해결하면서 딥러닝을 활용하는 알고리즘들이 연구되었다.  Chen은 auto-encoder를 활용하여 효율적으로 특징을 추출함으로써 SAR영상 목표물 인식 네트워크의 과적합문제를 해결하고자 하였다[1]. Li는 layer-by-layer 비지도 학습을 통하여 과적합문제를 완화하면서 깊은 네트워크를 학습시켰다[2]. Dong의 경우는 SAR영상을 위한 데이터 증대(data augmentation) 알고리즘을 고안하였고, 새로 생성된 많은 수의 학습데이터를 이용하여 깊은 네트워크를 학습시켜 높은 인식 성능을 보여주었다[3]. Chen은 CNN의 대부분의 학습 파라미터가 완전 연결층(fully connected (FC) layer)에서 발생한다는 점에 착안하여, 모든 계층이 콘볼루션(convolution) 계층인 A-Convnet을 고안하였다[4]. A-Convnet은 적은 수의 파라미터로 효율적인 특징 추출이 가능하여 높은 인식률을 보여주었다. 또한, Youm의 경우에는 통합된 하나의 네트워크가 다양한 편광(polarization) 타입의 SAR영상을 인식하게 학습할 수 있는 input scaling 알고리즘을 고안하였다[5]. Input scaling은 특징맵의 크기를 polarization 수에 변화에 강인하게 만들었으며, 이는 안정적인 네트워크 학습을 가능하게 하고, polarization간의 상관관계를 활용하게 하여 높은 인식률을 가지는 네트워크 학습을 가능하게 하였다.",다국어 초록 정보 없음

The learning process is not necessary in the convolution layer construction process using the discriminating random filter, thereby shortening the learning time of the overall deep learning. PCA reduces the amount of memory and computation throughput. The creation of the CNN structure using SVM maximizes the effect of reducing the amount of memory and computational throughput required.

In addition, it shows good performance in high dimensional data area such as voice, image and natural language, which was difficult to get good performance using existing machine learning techniques. However, in contrast, it is difficult to find deep leaning researches on traditional business data and structured data analysis. In this study, we tried to find out whether the deep learning techniques have been studied so far can be used not only for the recognition of high dimensional data but also for the binary classification problem of traditional business data analysis such as customer churn analysis, marketing response prediction, and default prediction. And we compare the performance of the deep learning techniques with that of traditional artificial neural network models.  The experimental data in the paper is the telemarketing response data of a bank in Portugal. It has input variables such as age, occupation, loan status, and the number of previous telemarketing and has a binary target variable that records whether the customer intends to open an account or not. In this study, to evaluate the possibility of utilization of deep learning algorithms and techniques in binary classification problem, we compared the performance of various models using CNN, LSTM algorithm and dropout, which are widely used algorithms and techniques in deep learning, with that of MLP models which is a traditional artificial neural network model. However, since all the network design alternatives can not be tested due to the nature of the artificial neural network, the experiment was conducted based on restricted settings on the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons in the hidden layer, the number of output data (filters), and the application conditions of the dropout technique. The F1 Score was used to evaluate the performance of models to show how well the models work to classify the interesting class instead of the overall accuracy.  The detail methods for applying each deep learning technique in the experiment is as follows. The CNN algorithm is a method that reads adjacent values from a specific value and recognizes the features, but it does not matter how close the distance of each business data field is because each field is usually independent. In this experiment, we set the filter size of the CNN algorithm as the number of fields to learn the whole characteristics of the data at once, and added a hidden layer to make decision based on the additional features. For the model having two LSTM layers, the input direction of the second layer is put in reversed position with first layer in order to reduce the influence from the position of each field. In the case of the dropout technique, we set the neurons to disappear with a probability of 0.5 for each hidden layer.  The experimental results show that the predicted model with the highest F1 score was the CNN model using the dropout technique, and the next best model was the MLP model with two hidden layers using the dropout technique. In this study, we were able to get some findings as the experiment had proceeded. First, models using dropout techniques have a"

Some of its important functions include “automatic differentiation” and “utilization of GPU”. The list of popular deep learning framework includes Caffe (BVLC) and Theano (University of Montreal). And recently, Microsofts deep learning framework, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, was released as open-source license, following Google’s Tensorflow a year earlier. The early deep learning frameworks have been developed mainly for research at universities. Beginning with the inception of Tensorflow, however, it seems that companies such as Microsoft and Facebook have started to join the competition of framework development. Given the trend, Google and other companies are expected to continue investing in the deep learning framework to bring forward the initiative in the artificial intelligence business. From this point of view, we think it is a good time to compare some of deep learning frameworks. So we compare three deep learning frameworks which can be used as a Python library. Those are Googles Tensorflow, Microsoft’s CNTK, and Theano which is sort of a predecessor of the preceding two.  The most common and important function of deep learning frameworks is the ability to perform automatic differentiation. Basically all the mathematical expressions of deep learning models can be represented as computational graphs, which consist of nodes and edges. Partial derivatives on each edge of a computational graph can then be obtained. With the partial derivatives, we can let software compute differentiation of any node with respect to any variable by utilizing chain rule of Calculus.  First of all, the convenience of coding is in the order of CNTK, Tensorflow, and Theano. The criterion is simply based on the lengths of the codes and the learning curve and the ease of coding are not the main concern. According to the criteria, Theano was the most difficult to implement with, and CNTK and Tensorflow were somewhat easier. With Tensorflow, we need to define weight variables and biases explicitly. The reason that CNTK and Tensorflow are easier to implement with is that those frameworks provide us with more abstraction than Theano. We, however, need to mention that low-level coding is not always bad. It gives us flexibility of coding. With the low-level coding such as in Theano, we can implement and test any new deep learning models or any new search methods that we can think of.  The assessment of the execution speed of each framework is that there is not meaningful difference. According to the experiment, execution speeds of Theano and Tensorflow are very similar, although the experiment was limited to a CNN model. In the case of CNTK, the experimental environment was not maintained as the same. The code written in CNTK has to be run in PC environment without GPU where codes execute as much as 50 times slower than with GPU. But we concluded that the difference of execution speed was within the range of variation caused by the different hardware setup.  In this study, we compared three types of deep learning framework: Theano, Tensorflow, and CNTK. According to Wikipedia, there are 12 available deep learning frameworks. And 15 different attributes differentiate each framework. Some of the important attributes would include interface language (Python, C ++, Java, etc.) and the availability of libraries on various deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, DBN, and etc. And if a user implements a large scale deep learning model, it will also be important to support multiple GPU or multiple servers. Also, if you are learning the deep learning model, it would also be important if there are enough examples and references."

robust object proposals re-ranking for object detection in autonomous driving using convolutional neural networks,2017,"['Object proposals', 'Autonomous driving', 'Object detection', 'Convolutional neural networks', 'Stereo vision.']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Object proposals have recently emerged as an essential cornerstone for object detection. The current state-of-the-art object detectors employ object proposals to detect objects within a modest set of candidate bounding box proposals instead of exhaustively searching across an image using the sliding window approach. However, achieving high recall and good localization with few proposals is still a challenging problem. The challenge becomes even more difficult in the context of autonomous driving, in which small objects, occlusion, shadows, and reflections usually occur. In this paper, we present a robust object proposals re-ranking algorithm that effectivity re-ranks candidates generated from a customized class-independent 3DOP (3D Object Proposals) method using a two-stream convolutional neural network (CNN). The goal is to ensure that those proposals that accurately cover the desired objects are amongst the few top-ranked candidates. The proposed algorithm, which we call DeepStereoOP, exploits not only RGB images as in the conventional CNN architecture, but also depth features including disparity map and distance to the ground. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms all existing object proposal algorithms on the challenging KITTI benchmark in terms of both recall and localization. Furthermore, the combination of DeepStereoOP and Fast R-CNN achieves one of the best detection results of all three KITTI object classes.</P>"
deep auto-context convolutional neural networks for standard-dose pet image estimation from low-dose pet/mri,2017,"['PET image restoration', 'Deep convolutional neural network', 'Auto-context strategy']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Positron emission tomography (PET) is an essential technique in many clinical applications such as tumor detection and brain disorder diagnosis. In order to obtain high-quality PET images, a standard-dose radioactive tracer is needed, which inevitably causes the risk of radiation exposure damage. For reducing the patient's exposure to radiation and maintaining the high quality of PET images, in this paper, we propose a deep learning architecture to estimate the high-quality standard-dose PET (SPET) image from the combination of the low-quality low-dose PET (LPET) image and the accompanying T1-weighted acquisition from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Specifically, we adapt the convolutional neural network (CNN) to account for the two channel inputs of LPET and T1, and directly learn the end-to-end mapping between the inputs and the SPET output. Then, we integrate multiple CNN modules following the auto-context strategy, such that the tentatively estimated SPET of an early CNN can be iteratively refined by subsequent CNNs. Validations on real human brain PET/MRI data show that our proposed method can provide competitive estimation quality of the PET images, compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Meanwhile, our method is highly efficient to test on a new subject, e.g., spending ∼2 s for estimating an entire SPET image in contrast to ∼16 min by the state-of-the-art method. The results above demonstrate the potential of our method in real clinical applications.</P>"

This paper introduces a couple of Korean sentence generation models that can automatically generate definitional statements as well as descriptions of technical terms and concepts. The proposed models are based on a deep learning model called LSTM (Long Sort-Term Memory) capable of effectively labeling textual sequences by taking into account the contextual relations of each item in the sequences. Our models take technical terms as inputs and can generate a broad range of heterogeneous textual descriptions that explain the concept of the terms. In the experiments using large-scale training collections, we confirmed that more accurate and reasonable sentences can be generated by CHAR-CNN-LSTM model that is a word-based LSTM exploiting character embeddings based on convolutional neural networks (CNN).

For implementation of deep learning networks in embedded system with limited processing power and memory, deep learning network may need to be simplified. However, simplified deep learning network cannot learn every possible scene. One realistic strategy for embedded deep learning network is to construct a simplified deep learning network model optimized for the scene images of the installation place. Then, automatic training will be necessitated for commercialization. In this paper, as an intermediate step toward automatic training under fisheye camera environments, we study more precise human localization in fisheye images, and propose an accurate human localization method, Automatic Ground-Truth Labelling Method (AGTLM). AGTLM first localizes candidate human object bounding boxes by utilizing GoogLeNet-LSTM approach, and after reassurance process by GoogLeNet-based CNN network, finally refines them more correctly and precisely(tightly) by applying saliency object detection technique.

In this study, Nixon in China is examined from a media perspective. The work is unique in opera history as it showed actual news clip on the opera stage for the first time. This superficial relevance of the media has hindered more fundamental study on the media relevance Nixon in China has. I consider the media relevance as a salient feature of Nixon in China. This study examined multiple aspects of the media that can be seen in Nixon in China through detailed analysis of its libretto, music and staging. What this analysis have found is as follows.Firstly, the material of Nixon in China is not `Nixon`s visit to China`, but `Nixon`s visit to China viewed on TV`. It is the key point we should pay attention. Characters are sensitively conscious of the media all the time. They act differently based on presence or absence of the media, which shows media-affected life of contemporary people.Secondly, the form which contains the material reflects that of TV media. Its format takes that of media; `pastiche` and `flow`. Nixon in China reflects pastiche in its unconnected events and fragmentary music. Also it uses the cycle of tension and relaxation very effectively to catch the eyes of the audience unfolding the story.Lastly, what is the core message of this opera through its media-oriented material and form? The theme of Nixon in China could be a critical reflection on media-oriented reality. The work captures media-oriented contemporary people in schizophrenia and nostalgia. Schizophrenia appears in split self consciousness and a word-play of signifier which lost meaning. Nostalgia works as an escape from reality. In Nixon in China, we could see nostalgia already includes TV, which reveals inexhaustible power of the media. This power reaches its peak in producing hyper-reality. Nixon in China reveals hyper-reality through play within a play. In showing the media through the opera, Verfremdung(Defamilarization) works effectively. It enables us to keep a distance from media by showing the content of media with its frame at the same time.Therefore Nixon in China could be read as an opera that mediates the media. It provides the profound reflection on media-oriented society and people. This is the core value of Nixon in China as a contemporary opera."
speech-act classification using a convolutional neural network based on pos tag and dependency-relation bigram embedding,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>In this paper, we propose a deep learning based model for classifying speech-acts using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The model uses some bigram features including parts-of-speech (POS) tags and dependency-relation bigrams, which represent syntactic structural information in utterances. Previous classification approaches using CNN have commonly exploited word embeddings using morpheme unigrams. However, the proposed model first extracts two different bigram features that well reflect the syntactic structure of utterances and then represents them as a vector representation using a word embedding technique. As a result, the proposed model using bigram embeddings achieves an accuracy of 89.05%. Furthermore, the accuracy of this model is relatively 2.8% higher than that of competitive models in previous studies.</P>"
face alignment using a deep neural network with local feature learning and recurrent regression,2017,"['Local feature learning', 'Head pose estimation', 'Facial landmark tracking', 'Face alignment', 'Deep neural network', 'Convolutional neural network']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"We propose a face alignment method that uses a deep neural network employing both local feature learning and recurrent regression. This method is primarily based on a convolutional neural network(CNN), which automatically learns local feature descriptors from the local facial landmark dataset that we created. Our research is motivated by the belief that investigating a face from its low-level component features would produce more competitive face alignment results, just as a CNN is normally trained to automatically learn a feature hierarchy from the lowest to the highest levels of abstraction. Moreover, by separately training the feature extraction layers and the regression layers, we impose an explicit functional discrimination between the feature extraction and regression tasks. First, we train a feature extraction network that is used to classify the landmark patches in the dataset. Using this pre-trained feature extraction network, we build a face alignment network, which uses an entire face image rather than the local landmark patch as input, thus generating the global facial features. The subsequent local feature extraction layer extracts the local feature set from this global feature, finally generating the local feature descriptors, in which space the network learns a generic descent direction from the currently estimated landmark positions to the ground truth via linear regression applied recurrently. Head pose estimation network also applied to provide a good initial estimate to the local feature extraction layer for accurate convergence. We found that learning of the good local landmark features in pursuit of good landmark classification also leads to a higher face alignment accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several public benchmark dataset. It signifies the importance of learning not only the global features but the local features for face alignment. We further verify our method's effectiveness when applied to related problems such as head pose estimation, facial landmark tracking, and invisible landmark detection. We believe that good local learning enables a deeper understanding of the face or object resulting in higher performance."

We used a simple CNN model for estimating finger motion by classifying images generated from a wavelet transform of EMG signals. The model has originally been used for document recognition, and it contains two pairs of convolution and pooling layers and two fully connected layers. A prototype system composed of inexpensive sensor devices was fabricated for acquiring EMG signals and capturing finger motion.

sensitive deep convolutional neural network for face recognition at large standoffs with small dataset,2017,"['Convolutional neural network', 'Gradient descent', 'Input-output mapping sensitivity error back propagation', 'Face recognition at long distances with small dataset', 'Sensitivity in cost function', 'Deep neural structures']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In this paper, we propose a sensitive convolutional neural network which incorporates sensitivity term in the cost function of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to emphasize on the slight variations and high frequency components in highly blurred input image samples. The proposed cost function in CNN has a sensitivity part in which the conventional error is divided by the derivative of the activation function, and subsequently the total error is minimized by the gradient descent method during the learning process. Due to the proposed sensitivity term, the data samples at the decision boundaries appear more on the middle band or the high gradient part of the activation function. This highlights the slight changes in the highly blurred input images enabling better feature extraction resulting in better generalization and improved classification performance in the highly blurred images. To study the effect of the proposed sensitivity term, experiments were performed for the face recognition task on small dataset of facial images at different long standoffs in both night-time and day-time modalities."
stacking pcanet +: an overly simplified convnets baseline for face recognition,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The principal component analysis network (PCANet) is asserted as a parsimonious stacking-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) instance for generic object recognition including face. However, to be regarded a CNN resemblance, PCANet lacks a nonlinearity in between two successive convolutional layers. The multilayer PCANet (by neglecting the nonlinearity pre-requisite) is also deemed far-fetched for the network depth beyond two, due to feature dimensionality explosion. We thus devise a PCANet alternative, dubbed PCANet+ in this letter, to untangle these constraints. To be more precise, conforming to the CNN essentials, PCANet+ conveys a mean-pooling unit manipulating each feature map. On top of that, we streamline the PCANet topology to permit a deep construction with an expanded PCA filter ensemble. We scrutinize the PCANet+ performance using face recognition technology and other two faces in the wild datasets, namely, labeled faces in the wild and YouTube faces. The experimental results reveal that the PCANet+ descriptor prevails over its predecessor and other stacking-based descriptors in face identification and verification, serving a baseline for ConvNets.</P>"

The understanding and expression of expression are very important to human computer interaction, and the technology to identify human expressions is very popular. Instead of searching for the emoticons that users often use, you can identify facial expressions with acamera, which is a useful technique that can be used now. This thesis puts forward the technology of the third data is available on the website of the set, use the content to improve the infrastructure of the facial expression recognition accuracy, in order to improve the synthesis of neural network algorithm, making the facial expression recognition model, the user s facial expressions and similar expressions, reached 66%.It doesn t need to search for emoticons. If you use the camera to recognize the expression, itwill appear emoticons immediately. So this service is the emoticons used when people send messages to others, and it can feel a lot of convenience. In countless emoticons, there is no need to find emoticons, which is an increasing trend in deep learning. So we need to use more suitable algorithm for expression recognition, and then improve accuracy."

JeoNet was modified to learn fewer features than VGGNet and ResNet, but shows the same performance. In order to obtain the detected ball’s position, the Single Shot Multibox Detector was applied. To verify JeoNet, an experimental environment was constructed in which a soccer robot finds a ball in the sight.

In the first step, the inputted fingerprint image is subjected to a complicated preprocessing stage, and the fingerprint image is then classified. In the second step, the feature points of the classified fingerprints are extracted and compared with the fingerprint feature points stored in a database. Human beings can easily classify fingerprint patterns without complicated image processing.

With the perspective, the paper focuses on the distinctive aspects of news-framing of 2017’s escalations of military confrontations between North Korea and the USA. Specifically, the author points out that the news coverage on the crisis should not be regarded as a ‘fake news’, rather be accepted as a reflection of public opinion of the international community. Mainstream international media are not facts-oriented messengers but significant influencers in formulating national policies toward the Korean peninsula. Sometimes the media may act as amplifiers or check-valves for the crisis itself. While acknowledging these influences of international media, the North Korean regime have induced lots of foreign reporters into Pyongyang and tried to spread out its intended messages. Kim Jong-Un’s calculations of counter-positioning himself with US president Donald Trump have mixed with media-oriented propaganda maneuvers and assertive provocations. Therefore military and security leaders of South Korea should enhance the mind-set and capabilities of strategic communication with clear understanding of the role of international media’s news framing on the Korean security crisis."

This allows enhancing the surveillance function in populated areas, where public opinion is strongly concerned about electromagnetic emissions and therefore antennas are suspiciously observed and radars are not allowed.

This study aims to understand the festival visitors’ destination image according to the exposed media information, attitude, and behavioral intention by adopting the Extended Theory of Planned Behavior (ETPB) including additional constructs such as media information and destination image. An on-site survey was conducted among 423 visitors attending the festival from January 21 to January 27, 2013. A total of 451 questionnaires were used for empirical analysis. The survey results revealed that both media information and three aspects of the festival’s image (cognitive, affective, and unique) indirectly influenced the festival visitors’ behavioral intention. Specifically, media information had a significant influence on all three aspects of the image, and it had the greatest influence on the unique image. Affective image and unique image significantly affected festival visitors’ attitude. Although attitude and subjective norm had significant effects on behavioral intention to attend the festival, perceived behavioral control and frequency of past behavior was statistically insignificant on behavioral intention.

However, music auto-tagging is distinguished from image classification in that the tags are highly diverse and have different levels of abstraction. Considering this issue, we propose a convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based architecture that embraces multi-level and multi-scaled features. The architecture is trained in three steps. First, we conduct supervised feature learning to capture local audio features using a set of CNNs with different input sizes. Second, we extract audio features from each layer of the pretrained convolutional networks separately and aggregate them altogether giving a long audio clip. Finally, we put them into fully connected networks and make final predictions of the tags. Our experiments show that using the combination of multi-level and multi-scale features is highly effective in music auto-tagging and the proposed method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods on the MagnaTagATune dataset and the Million Song Dataset.

We got higher performances of the classifier by decreasing the effects of data shortage and class imbalance. We executed experiments and evaluations for three datasets and got higher F1-score of character-level CNN classifier when applying transfer learning in all datasets."
blind deep s3d image quality evaluation via local to global feature aggregation,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Previously, no-reference (NR) stereoscopic 3D (S3D) image quality assessment (IQA) algorithms have been limited to the extraction of reliable hand-crafted features based on an understanding of the insufficiently revealed human visual system or natural scene statistics. Furthermore, compared with full-reference (FR) S3D IQA metrics, it is difficult to achieve competitive quality score predictions using the extracted features, which are not optimized with respect to human opinion. To cope with this limitation of the conventional approach, we introduce a novel deep learning scheme for NR S3D IQA in terms of local to global feature aggregation. A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model is trained in a supervised manner through two-step regression. First, to overcome the lack of training data, local patch-based CNNs are modeled, and the FR S3D IQA metric is used to approximate a reference ground-truth for training the CNNs. The automatically extracted local abstractions are aggregated into global features by inserting an aggregation layer in the deep structure. The locally trained model parameters are then updated iteratively using supervised global labeling, i.e., subjective mean opinion score (MOS). In particular, the proposed deep NR S3D image quality evaluator does not estimate the depth from a pair of S3D images. The S3D image quality scores predicted by the proposed method represent a significant improvement over those of previous NR S3D IQA algorithms. Indeed, the accuracy of the proposed method is competitive with FR S3D IQA metrics, having similar to 91% correlation in terms of MOS.</P>"

embedded deep vision in smart cameras for multi-view objects representation and retrieval,2017,"['Embedded processing', 'Convolutional neural network', 'Transfer learning', 'Image retrieval']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Active large scale surveillance of indoor and outdoor environments with multiple cameras is becoming an undeniable necessity in today's connected world. Enhanced computational and storage capabilities in smart cameras establish them as promising platforms for implementing intelligent and autonomous surveillance networks. However, poor resolution, limited number of samples per object, and pose variation in multi-view surveillance streams, make the task of efficient image representation highly challenging. To address these issues, we propose an efficient and powerful convolutional neural network (CNN) based framework for features extraction using embedded processing on smart cameras. Efficient, high performance, pre-trained CNNs are separately fine-tuned on persons and vehicles to obtain discriminative, low dimensional features from segmented surveillance objects. Furthermore, multi-view queries of surveillance objects are used to improve retrieval performance. Experiments reveal better efficiency and retrieval performance in different surveillance datasets.

sitting posture classification of children using convolutional neural network algorithm,2017,"['Sitting posture classification', 'Pressure distribution', 'Convolutional Neural Network']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Objective: The aim of this study is to create a posture monitoring system by classifying the sitting postures of children so that they can develop proper postural habits. Background: Modern people spend a lot of time sitting on chairs in various situation. Since sitting in improper postures can cause musculoskeletal disorders, it is important to have proper sitting habits to prevent negative health issues. In addition, it can be difficult for adults to habituate themselves to proper sitting posture away from their posture habits established in childhood. Therefore, developing proper postural habits from childhood is essential, which can be assisted by the posture monitoring system for children to establish their proper life-time posture habits. Method: A pressure sensing mattress was mounted in a seating cushion to obtain the pressure distribution data. A total of 32 children participated in the experiment and pressure data for seven sitting postures of each participant was obtained. LeNet-5, one of the early CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) algorithm, was applied in order to predict t he postures. Results: As a result of cross validations, the average accuracy was 62% and the standard deviation of accuracy was 0.11. Conclusion: In this study, the applicability of deep-learning technique to classify the sitting postures of children was investigated to be feasible. Further studies may focus on the enhancement of model’s accuracy and the experiment environment to be more context-based. Application: The study results are expected to be used in posture monitoring system that assist children in establishing a recommendable sitting posture habit."
human face tracking and modeling using active appearance model with motion estimation,2017,"['Image Processing', 'Human face tracking', 'Active Appearance Model']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Images and Videos that include the human face contain a lot of information. Therefore, accurately extracting human face is a very important issue in the field of computer vision. However, in real life, human faces have various shapes and textures. To adapt to these variations, A model-based approach is one of the best ways in which unknown data can be represented by the model in which it is built. However, the model-based approach has its weaknesses when the motion between two frames is big, it can be either a sudden change of pose or moving with fast speed. In this paper, we propose an enhanced human face-tracking model. This approach included human face detection and motion estimation using Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks, and continuous human face tracking and modeling correction steps using the Active Appearance Model. A proposed system detects human face in the first input frame and initializes the models. On later frames, Cascaded CNN face detection is used to estimate the target motion such as location or pose before applying the old model and fit new target."

Sentiment analysis has been applied for several real-world applications, such as chatbot. In the last five years, the practical use of the chatbot has been prevailing in many field of industry. In the chatbot applications, to recognize the user emotion, sentiment analysis must be performed in advance in order to understand the intent of speakers. The specific emotion is more than describing positive or negative sentences. In light of this context, we propose deep learning models for conducting multi-class sentiment analysis for identifying speaker’s emotion which is categorized to be joy, fear, guilt, sad, shame, disgust, and anger.Thus, we develop convolutional neural network (CNN), long short term memory (LSTM), and multi-layer neural network models, as deep neural networks models, for detecting emotion in a sentence. In addition, word embedding process was also applied in our research. In our experiments, we have found that long short term memory (LSTM) model performs best compared to convolutional neural networks and multi-layer neural networks.

fire detection using deep convolutional neural networks for assisting people with visual impairments in an emergency situation,2017,"['시각장애인', '화재감지', '심층학습', '심층 합성곱 신경망', 'blind people', 'fire detection', 'deep learning', 'deep convolutional networks']",본 연구는 실내에서 화재 발생시 시각 장애인들을 지원하기 위한 영상 기반의 화재감지기를 제안한다. 건물 내에 화재가 발생하는 비상 상황 발생시 시각 장애인은 일반인보다 상황을 인지하는 것이 늦기 때문에 위험한 상황에 노출되기 쉽다. 기존의 연기 감지기와 같은 현재의 화재 감지 방법은 화재 발생시 발생하는 화학 센서 기반 기술을 사용함으로써 감지가 상대적으로 늦으며 화재가 확산된 후에 감지가 되는 등 낮은 신뢰성이 문제가 될 수 있다. 이를 보완하기 위해 영상 기반의 화재 감지 기술이 개발되었지만 낮은 정확도가 문제가 되어 실용화되지 못하였다. 최근 인공 지능을 위한 심층 학습 분야의 큰 발전으로 영상 내의 물체 인식률이 높아짐에 따라 관련 연구가 활발히 진행되고 있다. 따라서 본 연구에서는 보안 카메라 영상을 사용하여 화재를 감지할 수 있는 심층 학습 기반의 화재 감지기를 제안한다. 심층 학습 기반의 접근법은 영상에서 자동으로 특징을 학습할 수 있으므로 일반적으로 복잡한 상황에 대해서도 일반화가 가능하다. 본 논문에서는 화재감지 정확도와 속도 측면의 균형을 고려하여 두 개의 심층 합성곱 신경망 모델을 제안하였다. 실험을 통해 두 모델 모두 99%의 평균 정밀도로 화재를 감지할 수 있으며 첫번째 모델은 초당 30장의 처리 속도와 76%의 정확도를 나타냈다. 두번째 모델은 초당 50장의 처리 속도와 61%의 정확도를 나타낸다. 또한 두 개의 모델의 메모리 사용량을 서로 비교하였으며 다양한 실제 화재 시나리오에서 테스트하여 신뢰할 수 있는 모델임을 증명하였다. 본 논문에 제안한 영상 기반 화재 감지기가 상용화된다면 상대적으로 실내 화재에 취약한 시각 장애인들의 안전에 도움이 될 것이다.,"In an event of an emergency, such as fire in a building, visually impaired and blind people are prone to exposed to a level of danger that is greater than that of normal people, for they cannot be aware of it quickly. Current fire detection methods such as smoke detector is very slow and unreliable because it usually uses chemical sensor based technology to detect fire particles. But by using vision sensor instead, fire can be proven to be detected much faster as we show in our experiments. Previous studies have applied various image processing and machine learning techniques to detect fire, but they usually don t work very well because these techniques require hand-crafted features that do not generalize well to various scenarios. But with the help of recent advancement in the field of deep learning, this research can be conducted to help solve this problem by using deep learning-based object detector that can detect fire using images from security camera. Deep learning based approach can learn features automatically so they can usually generalize well to various scenes. In order to ensure maximum capacity, we applied the latest technologies in the field of computer vision such as YOLO detector in order to solve this task. Considering the trade-off between recall vs. complexity, we introduced two convolutional neural networks with slightly different model s complexity to detect fire at different recall rate. Both models can detect fire at 99% average precision, but one model has 76% recall at 30 FPS while another has 61% recall at 50 FPS. We also compare our model memory consumption with each other and show our models robustness by testing on various real-world scenarios."

dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor attenuates obesity-induced myocardial fibrosis by inhibiting transforming growth factor-βl and smad2/3 pathways in high-fat diet-induced obesity rat model,2017,"['DPP4 inhibitor', 'Obesity', 'Myocardial fibrosis', 'TGF-β1 pathway', 'Smad2/3 pathway']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Obesity-induced myocardial fibrosis may lead to diastolic dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. Activation of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 and its downstream Smad2/3 pathways may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of obesity-induced myocardial fibrosis, and the antidiabetic dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4i) might affect these pathways. We investigated whether DPP4i reduces myocardial fibrosis by inhibiting the TGF-beta 1 and Smad2/3 pathways in the myocardium of a diet-induced obesity (DIO) rat model. Eight-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were fed either a normal fat diet (chow) or a high-fat diet (HFD) and then the HFD-fed SHRs were randomized to either the DPP4i (MK-0626) or control (distilled water) groups for 12 weeks. At 20 weeks old, all the rats underwent hemodynamic and metabolic studies and Doppler echocardiography. Compared with the normal fat diet (chow)-fed SHRs, the HFD-fed SHRs developed a more intense degree of hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia and showed a constellation of left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction, and exacerbated myocardial fibrosis, as well as activation of the TGF-beta 1 and Smad2/3 pathways. DPP4i significantly improved the metabolic and hemodynamic parameters. The echocardiogram showed that DPP4i improved the LV diastolic dysfunction (early to late ventricular filling velocity [E/A] ratio, 1.49 +/- 0.21 vs. 1.77 +/- 0.09, p < 0.05). Furthermore, DPP4i significantly reduced myocardial fibrosis and collagen production by the myocardium and suppressed TGF-beta 1 and phosphorylation of Smad2/3 in the heart. In addition, DPP4i decreased TGF-beta 1-induced collagen production and TGF-beta 1-mediated phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad2/3 in rat cardiac fibroblasts. In conclusion, DPP4 inhibition attenuated myocardial fibrosis and improved LV diastolic dysfunction in a DIO rat model by modulating the TGF-beta 1 and Smad2/3 pathways. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

inhibitory effects of resveratrol on airway remodeling by transforming growth factor-β/smad signaling pathway in chronic asthma model,2017,"['Resveratrol', 'TGF-β1', 'airway remodeling']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Purpose: Asthma is a chronic airway disease characterized by airway remodeling, leading to a progressive decline in lung function. Therapeutic agents that attenuate airway remodeling can complement the limited effects of traditional glucocorticoids. In this study, we investigated the effect of resveratrol on allergic airway inflammation and remodeling in a murine model of chronic bronchial asthma. Methods: Peribronchial smooth muscle thickening that developed in mice challenged with a 3-month repeated exposure to ovalbumin (OVA) was used to study airway remodeling. Oral resveratrol was administered daily during the OVA challenge. The expression of TGF-β1/Smad signaling proteins and downstream mesenchymal markers in the presence or absence of resveratrol was examined in bronchial epithelial cells. Results: OVA sensitization and chronic challenge increased airway hyperresponsiveness, inflammation, goblet cell hyperplasia, α-smooth muscle actin (SMA), and collagen deposition. Resveratrol effectively suppressed OVA-induced airway inflammation and remodeling. The expression of TGF-β1/phosphorylated Smad2/3 was increased in the lung tissues of OVA-challenged mice but effectively inhibited by resveratrol. In bronchial epithelial cells, the TGF-β1-induced expression of the mesenchymal markers snail, slug, vimentin, and α-SMA was suppressed by resveratrol treatment. Conclusions: Resveratrol effectively ameliorated both airway inflammation and airway structural changes in a mouse model of bronchial asthma. These effects were mediated by decreased TGF-β1 expression, in turn suppressing TGF-β1/Smad signaling and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process. Our results demonstrate the potential benefits of resveratrol for the treatment of airway remodeling associated with bronchial asthma."
finite element study of ferroresonance in single-phase transformers considering magnetic hysteresis,2017,"['ferroresonance', 'finite element method', 'transformers', 'Jiles-Atherton (JA) vector model', 'power loss']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The occurrence of ferroresonance in electrical systems including nonlinear inductors such as transformers will bring a lot of malicious damages. The intense ferromagnetic saturation of the iron core is the most influential factor in ferroresonance that makes nonsinusoidal current and voltage. So the nonlinear behavior modeling of the magnetic core is the most important challenge in the study of ferroresonance. In this paper, the ferroresonance phenomenon is investigated in a single phase transformer using the finite element method and considering the hysteresis loop. Jiles-Atherton (JA) inverse vector model is used for modeling the hysteresis loop, which provides the accurate nonlinear model of the transformer core. The steady-state analysis of ferroresonance is done while considering different capacitors in series with the no-load transformer. The accurate results from copper losses and iron losses are extracted as the most important specifications of transformers. The validity of the simulation results is confirmed by the corresponding experimental measurements."
wavelet based system identification for a nonlinear experimental model,2017,"['nonlinear system identification', 'wavelet transform', 'nonlinear test model', 'adjustable dampers', 'shake table test']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Traditional experimental verification for nonlinear system identification often faces the problem of experiment model repeatability. In our research, a steel frame experimental model is developed to imitate the behavior of a single story steel frame under horizontal excitation. Two adjustable rotational dampers are used to simulate the plastic hinge effect of the damaged beam-column joint. This model is suggested as a benchmark model for nonlinear dynamics study. Since the nonlinear form provided by the damper is unknown, a Morlet wavelet based method is introduced to identify the mathematical model of this structure under different damping cases. After the model identification, earthquake excitation tests are carried out to verify the generality of the identified model. The results show the extensive applicability and effectiveness of the identification method."
selective encryption algorithm for 3d printing model based on clustering and dct domain,2017,"['3D printing data', '3D printing security', 'Selective encryption', 'DCT', 'Clustering']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Three-dimensional (3D) printing is applied to many areas of life, but 3D printing models are stolen by pirates and distributed without any permission from the original providers. Moreover, some special models and anti-weapon models in 3D printing must be secured from the unauthorized user. Therefore, 3D printing models must be encrypted before being stored and transmitted to ensure access and to prevent illegal copying. This paper presents a selective encryption algorithm for 3D printing models based on clustering and the frequency domain of discrete cosine transform. All facets are extracted from 3D printing model, divided into groups by the clustering algorithm, and all vertices of facets in each group are transformed to the frequency domain of a discrete cosine transform. The proposed algorithm is based on encrypting the selected coefficients in the frequency domain of discrete cosine transform to generate the encrypted 3D printing model. Experimental results verified that the proposed algorithm is very effective for 3D printing models. The entire 3D printing model is altered after the encryption process. The decrypting error is approximated to be zero. The proposed algorithm provides a better method and more security than previous methods."

2d wavelet transform data compression with error level guarantee for z-map models,2017,"['Irreversible data compression', 'Haar wavelet', 'Potential error range', 'NC milling simulation']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Most of workpiece shapes in NC milling simulations are in Z-map representations that require a very large amount of data to precisely hold a high resolution model. An irreversible compression algorithm for Z-map models using a two-dimensional Haar wavelet transform is proposed to resolve this tight memory situation for an ordinary PC. A shape model is first transformed by using Haar wavelet to build a wavelet synopsis tree while the maximum errors caused by virtually truncating high-frequency components are simultaneously calculated. The total amount of the shape data can be reduced by truncating particular sections of the wavelet components that satisfy the error threshold given by the user. Our algorithm guarantees that any error due to its irreversible compression processes is smaller than the specified level measured against the original model. A series of experiments were conducted using an Apple iMac with a 3.2 GHz CPU and 8 GB of memory. The experiments were performed with 16 sample shape models on 512?512 to 8192?8192 grids to evaluate the compression efficiency of the proposed method.Experimental results confirmed that our compression algorithm requires approximately 20–30 ms for 512?512 models and 7 s for 8192?8192 models under a maximum error level of 10? 10?6 m (a typical criteria for NC milling simulations). The compressed binaries outputted by the proposed method are generally 25–35% smaller than the baseline results by gzip, one of common reversible compression libraries, while these two methods require almost the same level of computational costs."
control of large model mismatch systems using multiple models,2017,"['H∞ performance', 'large uncertainty', 'multiple models', 'robust control']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"H∞ control is an effective approach to handle model uncertainties. However, when modeling mismatchis large, it tends to be challenging to meet the desired requirements of both stability and performance by only usinga single H∞ controller. This study presents a switching method to enhance the robust stability and performanceof H∞ control by dividing the range of dynamics into multiple uncertain models. The candidate robust controllersare designed by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities for each uncertain model. A structural scheduling logicthat selects the most proper controller into closed-loop is proposed. The selected controller can ensure boundedexponentially weighted H∞ norm of the closed-loop switching systems. This work analyses their robust stabilityand disturbance attenuation performance via a linear fractional transformation by using the small gain theorem.

probabilistic forecasting of drought: a hidden markov model aggregated with the rcp 8.5 precipitation projection,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The creeping characteristics of drought make it possible to mitigate drought's effects with accurate forecasting models. Drought forecasts are inevitably plagued by uncertainties, making it necessary to derive forecasts in a probabilistic framework. In this study, we proposed a new probabilistic scheme to forecast droughts that used a discrete-time finite state-space hidden Markov model (HMM) aggregated with the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP) precipitation projection (HMM-RCP). The standardized precipitation index (SPI) with a 3-month time scale was employed to represent the drought status over the selected stations in South Korea. The new scheme used a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for inference on the model parameters and performed an RCP precipitation projection transformed SPI (RCP-SPI) weight-corrected post-processing for the HMM-based drought forecasting to perform a probabilistic forecast of SPI at the 3-month time scale that considered uncertainties. The point forecasts which were derived as the HMM-RCP forecast mean values, as measured by forecasting skill scores, were much more accurate than those from conventional models and a climatology reference model at various lead times. We also used probabilistic forecast verification and found that the HMM-RCP provided a probabilistic forecast with satisfactory evaluation for different drought categories, even at long lead times. In a drought event analysis, the HMM-RCP accurately predicted about 71.19 % of drought events during the validation period and forecasted the mean duration with an error of less than 1.8 months and a mean severity error of < 0.57. The results showed that the HMM-RCP had good potential in probabilistic drought forecasting.</P>"

Based on recently developed generalized thermoelasticity theory with fractional order strain, the two-dimensional governing equations are obtained in the context of generalized magneto-thermo-viscoelasticity theory without energy dissipation. The Kelvin-Voigt model of linear viscoelasticity is employed to describe the viscoelastic nature of the material. The resulting formulation of the field equations is solved analytically in the Laplace and Fourier transform domain. On the application of inclined load at the surface of half-space, the analytical expressions for the normal displacement, strain, temperature, normal stress and tangential stress are derived in the joint-transformed domain. To restore the fields in physical domain, an appropriate numerical algorithm is used for the inversion of the Laplace and Fourier transforms. Finally, we have demonstrated the effect of magnetic field, viscosity, mechanical relaxation time, fractional order parameter and time on the physical fields in graphical form for copper material. Some special cases have also been deduced from the present investigation."
field monitoring of splitting failure for surrounding rock masses and applications of energy dissipation model,2017,"['high geostress', 'underground cavern group', 'splitting failure', 'in-situ monitoring', 'energy dissipation', 'opening displacement']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Due to high in-situ stress and brittleness of rock mass, the surrounding rock masses of underground caverns are prone to appear splitting failure. In this paper, a kind of loading-unloading variable elastic modulus model has been initially proposed and developed based on energy dissipation principle, and the stress state of elements has been determined by a splitting failure criterion. Then the underground caverns of Dagangshan hydropower station is analyzed using the above model. For comparing with the monitoring results, the entire process of rock splitting failure has been achieved through monitoring the splitting failure on side walls of large-scale caverns in Dagangshan via borehole TV, micro-meter and deformation resistivity instrument. It shows that the maximum depth of splitting area in the downstream sidewall of the main power house is approximately 14 m, which is close to the numerical results, about 12.5 m based on the energy dissipation model. As monitoring result, the calculation indicates that the key point displacement of caverns decreases firstly with the distance from main powerhouse downstream side wall rising, and then increases, because this area gets close to the side wall of main transformer house and another smaller splitting zone formed here. Therefore it is concluded that the energy dissipation model can preferably present deformation and fracture zones in engineering, and be very useful for similar projects."

emergent geometric description for a topological phase transition in the kitaev superconductor model,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Resorting to Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) transformations, we propose an emergent geometric description for a topological phase transition in the Kitaev superconductor model. An effective field theory consists of an emergent bulk action with an extra dimension, an ultraviolet (UV) boundary condition for an initial value of a coupling function, and an infrared (IR) effective action with a fully renormalized coupling function. The bulk action describes the evolution of the coupling function along the direction of the extra dimension, where the extra dimension is identified with an RG scale and the resulting equation of motion is nothing but a beta function. In particular, the IR effective field theory turns out to be consistent with a Callan-Symanzik equation which takes into account both the bulk and IR boundary contributions. This derived Callan-Symanzik equation gives rise to a metric structure. Based on this emergent metric tensor, we uncover the equivalence of the entanglement entropy between the emergent geometric description and the quantum field theory in the vicinity of the quantum critical point.</P>"

is the artification process perceived by final consumers of luxury products? results from an experiment based on the application of the customer-based brand equity model,2017,"['artification', 'CbBE model', 'Louis Vuitton', 'luxury brands', 'visual art']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Recent research has shown that many companies in the fashion industry are increasingly weaving close relationships with the art world, to appropriate art values and meanings to be associated with their own products and brands (Hagdtvedt & Patrick, 2008a; 2008b). Businesses related to the fashion luxury sector have been especially prone to using such strategies to transform their products into true artworks to address the issue of commodification resulting from high production volumes (Dion and Arnoult, 2011; Riot, Chameret & Rigaud, 2013). Over the past two decades, the luxury market has undergone huge structural changes through mergers and acquisitions that have transformed an industry made up of small, family businesses into major financial conglomerates and brand owners (Roux & Floch, 1996; Crane 2012). Secondly, globalization and openness to new fast-growing markets such as Asia, have led these luxury conglomerates to increase sales volumes, failing in one of the basic characteristics of such goods: rarity. But if the real rarity of luxury products is a promise that companies can no longer guarantee their own consumers, the elitism of these products can be ensured through an artificial rarity. Jean-No?l Kapferer used the neologism artification recently introduced by French sociologists Nathalie Heinich and Roberta Shapiro and applied it to the analysis of luxury goods (Kapferer, 2012; 2014; Heinich and Shapiro, 2012; Shapiro and Heinich, 2012). He stressed that a strategy based on art implemented by luxury companies is useful mainly to support the perception of rarity by the final consumer. Artification is based on the notion that art –related objects or persons are associated with positive values. Enhancing a corporate image in the consumer’s mind means building positive ties to the brand that will initiate a form of benevolence towards the brand, providing the legitimization of corporate actions and, in some cases, resulting in the purchase of goods and services produced and distributed by the company (Keller, 1993; Aaker, 1996; Aaker & Joachimsthaler, 2000; Keller, 2003). We decided to analyse the effect of Artification on brand value by focusing on the four dimensions of Awareness, Image, Quality and Loyalty by using the same CbBE ( Customer-based Brand Equity) structure previous authors tested on country of origin effect on consumers, based on the main hypotheses further explained (Pappu, Quester & Cooksey, 2006). The first hypothesis relates to the dimension of Awareness and aims to test the level of brand recognition in final consumers when the logo is modified by an artist. • H1 – Consumers’ awareness remains strong when the brand is ‘artified’. We analyze then the Image, as the second dimension of CbBE. Due to the complexity of this dimension, we posited two hypotheses connected to it: • H2a – Consumers’ free associations to the brand are connected to the artworld when the brand is ‘artified’ (e.g. consumers indicate words as art, contemporary art or the name of the artist). • H2b – Consumers’ evaluation of the brand image points to stronger positive associations when the brand is ‘artified’ The last two hypotheses we mention are connected to the dimensions of Quality and Loyalty: • H3 – Consumers’ evaluation of Quality increases when the brand is ‘artified’. ? H4 – Consumers’ Loyalty to the brand increases when the brand is ‘artified’. • The analysis was conducted through a between-subjects randomized experiment and manipulated art presence (with art versus without art). Starting from the same panel, two groups were created: one including the treatment (visual arts) and one including no treatment at all. Furthermore, we limited ourselves in this experiment to images of products and pattern created by Louis Vuitton that are actually on the market, associating them randomly to the research units in order to obtain two statistically consistent groups subjected to the different treatment (with art or without art)4. The two groups were labelled ‘artified’ group and control group, the first grouping the respondents to the questionnaire containing images of Louis Vuitton Logo, pattern and product modified by art collaboration with Yayoi Kusama; and the second grouping the respondents to the questionnaire containing images of Louis Vuitton Logo, pattern and product in its standard design. The questionnaire was distributed between the months of May and June 2015 via Qualtrics survey software. It was divided into four distinct blocks: the first concerned the presentation of the survey, the declaration of authorization signed by the participants and the demographic information; the second and the third blocks of questions were identical, with the same series of questions but based on different images used. There were 880 respondents, 825 of whom correctly filled the questionnaire we submitted to them. The control group was made of 413 respondents, 73.13 % of whom were female and 26.87 % male. The ‘artified’ group was made of 71.60 % female and 28.40 % male. We analyzed the four dimensions of Awareness, Image, Quality and Loyalty individually and in a comparative manner between the control and ‘artified’ groups. In the CbBE model, dimensions are analyzed individually since Awareness and brand Image measures are not comparable because they are collected through different measure methods, respectively through multiple choice and open-ended questions. Such dimensions as Image, Quality and Loyalty which were raised through Likert scales were then subjected to mono multivariate statistical analysis. The main results are shown in table 1. By reading the results for CbBE, Hypothesis H1 [Consumers’ awareness remain strong when the brand is ‘artified’] has been confirmed. The aided brand awareness shows no important differences between the two groups, so visual artists may modify logos or the appearance of luxury products without the fear of compromising brand awareness in the final consumers. Hypothesis H2a [Consumers’ free associations to the brand are connected to the arts when the brand is ‘artified’ (e.g. the word art, contemporary art or the name of the artist)] was not confirmed. Hypothesis H2b was partially confirmed as Generic Associations and Brand Personality were impacted by the use of the visual arts, while Organizational Associations were not. Brand loyalty and Perceived Quality were not impacted by the Visual Arts either, so Hypothesis H3 and H4 were not confirmed. As a main result for CbBE analysis, the Visual Arts have an impact on Customer-based Brand Equity, limited to Brand Image dimensions. The fact that Brand Image is one of the most complex dimensions of brand value opens the way to the development of future analysis and research in the visual arts as external source for brand equity, especially for Brand Personality. The main results of our research show that an artification effect is visible especially at the level of brand image and brand personality, two complex and valuable components of Brand Value from a consumer perspective. This opens to further in-depth analysis of these two components for future research. Large luxury groups (such as Cartier and Prada) have long used an art-based strategy to increase the value of their products, avoiding the risk of a loss of prestige perceived by the final consumer who would no longer recognize the exclusivity of a product that seems to be increasingly more industrial than handmade. Art can therefore contribute to alter and rework the image and market position of a specific brand or an entire product line, ensuring the transition from an ordinary image to a prestigious one, or strengthening the existing prestigious perception (Hetsroni & Tukachinsky, 2005; Lee et Al., 2015). We believe that a strategy based on art implemented by luxury companies is beneficial mainly to support the perception of rarity by the final consumer. Luxury goods would have to be unique or at least not produced in too high volumes precisely because of their craftsmanship and the care with which they are made. Rarity is not compatible with the increase in sales volumes required by the financial holdings that own the same luxury brands (Roux and Lipovetsky, 2003; Kapferer, 2012; 2014; 2015). The artification process we researched would have exactly the dual purpose of improving the brand image of companies that apply it, while increasing the perception of luxury in end consumers. What is more, we believe that the luxury brands from the industry sector that belong to large financial conglomerates now have the strength to simultaneously apply all the components in the artification process, by sustaining activities of sponsorship, philanthropy or generic collaboration with artists. The fact that luxury products are an integral part of the world of visual arts combined with the fact luxury brands have now the strong support base of large financial conglomerates can ensure the right economic and cultural support needed for the application of such a strategy. In the case of fashion companies, we believe artification is a process in itinere. In our experiment free associations to the brand show that only 2 consumers out of 880 remembered or knew the name of the artist (Yayoi Kusama) and 10 people indicated the substantive ‘art’ or ‘contemporary arts’ as free associations in the ‘artified group’ (only 2 in the control group). This shows that luxury brands ‘art-based strategy cannot only concentrate on temporary collaborations with artists. Luxury brands as Louis Vuitton must act as art institutions able to display arts collections to the widest public and bestow art status and global recognition to collaborating artists (Mas? and Cedrola, 2017).

a novel evidence theory model and combination rule for reliability estimation of structures,2017,"['evidence theory', 'fuzzy set', 'combination rule', 'hybrid reliability']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Due to the discontinuous nature of uncertainty quantification in conventional evidence theory(ET), the computational cost of reliability analysis based on ET model is very high. A novel ET model based on fuzzy distribution and the corresponding combination rule to synthesize the judgments of experts are put forward in this paper. The intersection and union of membership functions are defined as belief and plausible membership function respectively, and the Murfhy’s average combination rule is adopted to combine the basic probability assignment for focal elements. Then the combined membership functions are transformed to the equivalent probability density function by a normalizing factor. Finally, a reliability analysis procedure for structures with the mixture of epistemic and aleatory uncertainties is presented, in which the equivalent normalization method is adopted to solve the upper and lower bound of reliability. The effectiveness of the procedure is demonstrated by a numerical example and an engineering example. The results also show that the reliability interval calculated by the suggested method is almost identical to that solved by conventional method. Moreover, the results indicate that the computational cost of the suggested procedure is much less than that of conventional method. The suggested ET model provides a new way to flexibly represent epistemic uncertainty, and provides an efficiency method to estimate the reliability of structures with the mixture of epistemic and aleatory uncertainties."

A yield surface-independent Frank–Brockman elasto-viscoplastic model is introduced to express the nonlinear material behavior such as softening beyond yield point, plateau, and densification under compressive loads. In particular, the hardening- and softening-dominant material functions are introduced and adopted in the plastic multiplier to describe each nonlinear material behavior separately. In addition, the elasto-viscoplastic model is transformed into an implicit type discrete model, and is programmed as a user-defined material subroutine in commercial finite element analysis code. In particular, the consistent tangent modulus method is proposed to improve the computational convergence and to save computational time during finite element analysis. Through the developed material library, the nonlinear stress–strain relationship is analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively, and the simulation results are compared with the results of compression test on the trabecular bone to validate the proposed constitutive model, computational method, and material library.</P>"
development of a predictive model for study of skin-core phenomenon in stabilization process of pan precursor,2017,"['Thermal stabilization', 'Skin-core morphology', 'Non-parametric density estimation', 'Probability density function', 'Non-linear predictive modelling', 'Stochastic model']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Studying the presence and progress offiber defects, such as skin-core structure, is an important tool foranalysis of a chemical process. In this article, the skin core morphology has been analyzed by opticalmicroscopic (OM) images and Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflectance mapping (FTIR-ATRmapping). The results of FTIR-ATR mapping showed that thefiber is almost uniform in the core area whileOM images are accurate enough to be used for skin-core analysis. Using OM images, the core ratio ofsamples were measured to quantify the skin-core structure. Non-parametric kernel density estimationmethods have then been compared with conventional parametric distribution models using these data.The results reveal that the parametric methods cannot adequately describe the skin-core phenomenonand that the non-parametric distributions are more appropriate for the quantification of skin-coremorphology. By applying the non-parametric distributions, a model has been developed, which describesthe relationship between the skin-core defect and the operation parameters of thefiber production. Thisapproach can be used to predict the probability of skin-core occurrence and can be used to decrease thepresence of this phenomenon in the carbonfibers production industry. Our results show thattemperature is one of the most significant operational parameter at a typical oxygen concentration (in airat atmospheric pressure) governing the skin-core formation."
correlation between generative grammar and school grammar: with a focus on an alternative model of teaching korean grammar,2017,"['school grammar', 'generative grammar', 'educational model of generative grammar', 'Korean school grammar']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This study will discuss generative grammar and the current Korean school grammar from a comparative point of view and show that the theoretical development of generative grammar can be incorporated into school grammar. Since Chomsky (1965) generative grammar has been steadily developed through transformational generative grammar, government and binding theory, and minimalist theory. This has resulted in the creation of various models of sentence analysis. However, the radical progress and changes of generative grammar have not been actively reflected in the teaching methods used in the instruction of Korean grammar. This study will offer an alternative educational model for the instruction of Korean school grammar. This new model, which is based on the current trends of generative grammar, may provide a more effective and precise method for teaching school grammar in the Korean classroom."
optimal separation of phenol from model oils by forming deep eutectic solvents with quaternary ammonium salts,2017,"['Deep Eutectic Solvents', 'Separation', 'Phenol']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Various quaternary ammonium salts are used to separate phenol from model oil by forming deep eutectic solvents (DESs). The results indicate that the types of quaternary ammonium salt ions and the molecular symmetry of quaternary ammonium have obvious influence on recovery for phenol. Tetraethylammonium chloride (TEAC), which contains suitable ions and symmetry reveals highest phenol recovery in the model oil. The separation mechanism is discussed and the structures of DESs (TEAC/Phenol) are proved on Fourier transform infrared transform (FTIR). To recycle TEAC, diethyl ether is used as anti-solvent to precipitate TEAC from TEAC/Phenol system. The structure of regeneration TEAC is proved on FTIR and 1H NMR. The recovery for phenol is decreased from 97.45% to 14.30% with the increase of regeneration times. The optimal separation condition was obtained by response surface methodology at 30 oC (separation temperature) for 40 min (separation time) with 3.75 g TEAC (mass of TEAC) in 10 mL model oil (phenol recovery: 99.3%). In contrast to the traditional methods to separate phenol, this proposed method avoids the use of alkalis and acid, and with less effluent."
constraining end effects in empirical mode decomposition via a nash nonlinear grey bernoulli model,2017,"['empirical mode decomposition', 'Hilbert-Huang transform', 'grey model', 'Nash nonlinear grey Bernoulli model']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The conventional analysis of temporal signals rely on techniques such as Fourier transform, wavelet analysis, Wigner- Vile distribution, and nonlinear time series analysis methods, that assume either stationarity, linearity, or both. On the other hand, the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is an adaptive algorithm that decomposes a signal into its fundamental modes of oscillations, or intrinsic mode functions (IMF), and has been shown to produce a meaningful representation of nonlinear and nonstationary processes commonly found in fields such as physics and biology. One of the main problems of the EMD algorithm is the occurrence of end effects, i.e, if the endpoint of the signal is not the extreme point, as the algorithm is applied there appear end swings which back propagates, leading to distorted components in the estimated IMF. Here we introduce a modification to the EMD algorithm to constraint the end effect, based on the use of a Nash nonlinear grey Bernoulli model (NNGBM) to forecast the signal’s boundary. Numerical simulations show that our approach estimates all IMFs with a higher degree of accuracy than previous methods and is more stable under increases in the nonlinear and non-stationarity properties of the signals."
viscoelastic behavior of naghdi shell model based on efficient higher-order zig-zag theory,2017,"['Composite laminates', 'Zig-zag shell theory', 'Viscoelasticity', 'Laplace transformation']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>This paper proposes a method based on efficient higher-order zig-zag theory to analyze the viscoelastic response of doubly-curved laminated shell structures. In the general curvilinear coordinates, displacement fields are obtained by imposing a varying cubic displacement field on a varying linear zig-zag field. Then, the transverse shear stress-free condition at the top and bottom surfaces and the continuity condition at the interfaces are employed to reduce the number of unknown variables. The Laplace transformation is then used to simplify the integral-formed constitutive equation for viscoelastic material in the real time domain into a linear system equation in the Laplace domain so that all computations can be carried out in the Laplace domain. Therefore, the equilibrium equation for general viscoelastic Naghdi shell model can be obtained by converting the virtual work principle into the Laplace domain. Finally, solutions for the long-term viscoelastic properties in the real-time domain are obtained by using numerical inverse Laplace techniques. To simplify the formulation and conveniently evaluate the method proposed in the present study and to compare its outcomes with those of an elastic laminated composite shell, several numerical examples for a cylindrical shallow shell model are investigated.</P>"
spatially distinct response of rice yield to autonomous adaptation under the cmip5 multi-model projections,2017,"['Rice production', 'climate change', 'adaptation', 'CMIP5', 'M-GAZE']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a very important staple crop, as it feeds more than half of the world’s population. Numerous studies have focused on the negative impacts of climate change on rice production. However, there is little debate on which region of the world is more vulnerable to climate change and how adaptation to this change can mitigate the negative impacts on rice production. We investigated the impacts of climate change on rice yield, based on simulations combining a global crop model, M-GAZE, and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) multi-model projections.Our focus was the impact of mitigating emission forcings (representative concentration pathway RCP 4.5 vs. RCP 8.5) and autonomous adaptation (i.e., changing crop variety and planting date) on rice yield. In general, our results showed that climate change due to anthropogenic warming leads to a significant reduction in rice yield. However, autonomous adaptation provides the potential to reduce the negative impact of global warming on rice yields in a spatially distinct manner. The adaptation was less beneficial for countries located at a low latitude (e.g., Cambodia, Thailand, Brazil) compared to mid-latitude countries (e.g., USA, China, Pakistan), as regional climates at the lower latitudes are already near the upper temperature thresholds for acceptable rice growth. These findings suggest that the socioeconomic effects from rice production in lowlatitude countries can be highly vulnerable to anthropogenic global warming. Therefore, these countries need to be accountable to develop transformative adaptation strategies, such as adopting (or developing) heat-tolerant varieties, and/or improve irrigation systems and fertilizer use efficiency."

magnetic saturation effect of the iron core in current transformers under lightning flow,2017,"['Current transformer', 'Iron core', 'Electromotive force', 'Surge', 'Finite element method', 'Fourier series']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"A current transformer (CT) is a type of sensor that consists of a combination of electric and magnetic circuits,and it measures large ac currents. When a large amount of current flows into the primary winding, the alternatingmagnetic flux in the iron core induces an electromotive force in the secondary winding. The characteristics of a CTare determined by the iron core design because the iron core is saturated above a certain magnetic flux density. Inparticular, when a large current, such as a current surge, is input into a CT, the iron core becomes saturated and theinduced electromotive force in the secondary winding fluctuates severely. Under these conditions, the CT no longerfunctions as a sensor. In this study, the characteristics of the secondary winding were investigated using the timedifferencefinite element method when a current surge was provided as an input. The CT was modeled as a twodimensionalanalysis object using constraints, and the saturation characteristics of the iron core were evaluated usingthe Newton-Rhapson method. The results of the calculation were compared with the experimental data. The results ofthis study will prove useful in the designs of the iron core and the windings of CTs."

First, a modified POE-based calibration model was established together with the modeling, identification and correction steps. It eliminates the joint offset errors and the dependent constrained parameters of joint screw errors in traditional POE-based models, which has completeness, continuity and minimality properties simultaneously and avoids normalization and orthogonalization operations. It also eliminates transformation errors of position detection information through adopting distance accuracy definition. Then, focusing on measurement step, the flowchart in a virtual closed-loop form is constructed with an infrared laser beam device and a simple observation surface.Meanwhile, the selection procedure for measurement configurations is figured out to determine the optimal number and the corresponding calibration set. Finally, experimental studies were conducted on a self-developed serial manipulator. The results of self-calibration experiments show that the proposed method is feasible and effective, and the distance accuracy could be improved by 73.64 % after performing optimal type. The results of comparison experiments with traditional external or self-calibration methods indicate that the proposed method could further improve convergence property and achievable accuracy of calibration effects, which also outperforms in terms of simplicity and accuracy."

biotransformation of major ginsenosides in ginsenoside model culture by lactic acid bacteria,2017,"['biotransformation', 'fermentation', 'ginseng', 'ginsenoside', 'lactic acid bacteria']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Background: Some differences have been reported in the biotransformation of ginsenosides, probably due to the types of materials used such as ginseng, enzymes, and microorganisms. Moreover, most microorganisms used for transforming ginsenosides do not meet food-grade standards. We investigated the statistical conversion rate of major ginsenosides in ginsenosides model culture during fermentation by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to estimate possible pathways. Methods: Ginsenosides standard mix was used as a model culture to facilitate clear identification of the metabolic changes. Changes in eight ginsenosides (Rb1, Rb2, Rc, Rd, Re, Rf, Rg1, and Rg2) during fermentation with six strains of LAB were investigated. Results: In most cases, the residual ginsenoside level decreased by 5.9-36.8% compared with the initial ginsenoside level. Ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, Rc, and Re continuously decreased during fermentation. By contrast, Rd was maintained or slightly increased after 1 d of fermentation. Rg1 and Rg2 reached their lowest values after 1-2 d of fermentation, and then began to increase gradually. The conversion of Rd, Rg1, and Rg2 into smaller deglycosylated forms was more rapid than that of Rd from Rb1, Rb2, and Rc, as well as that of Rg1 and Rg2 from Re during the first 2 d of fermentation with LAB. Conclusion: Ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, Rc, and Re continuously decreased, whereas ginsenosides Rd, Rg1, and Rg2 increased after 1-2 d of fermentation. This study may provide new insights into the metabolism of ginsenosides and can clarify the metabolic changes in ginsenosides biotransformed by LAB."

Most of them are either conceptual or case-based with very few empirical studies. While the customer-centric management innovation has been widely discussed in the management consulting area for the past decade, the issue has not been tackled vigorously in the academic society. As a result, it is needed to build a firm theoretical framework on this issue.The purpose of this research is to explore key variables of customer-centric management innovation in terms of the following four dimensions - (1) strategic innovation, (2) organizational innovation, (3) product innovation, and (4) operational innovation; and to empirically investigate the influence of the customer-centric management innovation on customers' happiness which consists of economic, emotional, and meaningful happiness during all the phases of the customer activity cycle. This study focuses on establishing a theoretical foundation for the customer-centric management innovation.A hierarchical construct model was developed to derive the concept of customer-centric management innovation from the four different dimensions. The hierarchical construct model in this study proposes that customer-centric management innovation consists of the following four lower-order constructs: i) customer-centric strategic innovation which has also the two lower-order constructs such as offering multi-dimensional values and providing customized solutions to customers, ii) customer-centric organizational innovation with having the four lower-order constructs such as creating diversity within an organization, capitalizing on collective intelligence, guaranteeing employees’ discretionary autonomy, and organizing hybrid structure, iii) customer-centric product innovation with having the four lower-order constructs, i.e., designing human-centered product, designing integrated product and service, product convergence, and open product innovation, and iv) customer-centric operational innovation with the two lower-order constructs such as transforming into customer-oriented operational process and implementing customer-centric information system. This study hypothesized that the customer-centric management innovation with the four dimensions of customer-centric strategic innovation, customer-centric organizational innovation, customer-centric product innovation, and customer-centric operational innovation would have a positive influence on customer happiness.This study surveyed 250 manufacturing and information and communications technology(ICT) firms in Korea for an empirical analysis. This study employed SmartPLS to analyze the influence of the customer-centric management innovation on customer happiness. The analysis results revealed that the four dimensions of customer-centric management innovation were empirically validated to have a positive impact on customer happiness, which in turn resulted in firm performance in a positive way.This study has the following theoretical implications. First, this study proposes that the concept of customer-centric management innovation has multi-level constructs with a hierarchy. That is, this study describes the concept of customer-centric management innovation as the fourth-order construct with the multi-staged hierarchical structure consisting of several lower-order constructs.

genetic parameters of calving ease using sire-maternal grandsire model in korean holsteins,2017,"['Calving Ease', 'Snell Score', 'Genetic Parameters', 'Holstein Cattle', 'Sire-maternal Grandsire Model']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Objective: Calving ease (CE) is a complex reproductive trait of economic importance in dairy cattle. This study was aimed to investigate the genetic merits of CE for Holsteins in Korea. Methods: A total of 297,614 field records of CE, from 2000 to 2015, from first parity Holstein heifers were recorded initially. After necessary data pruning such as age at first calving (18 to 42 mo), gestation length, and presence of sire information, final datasets for CE consisted of 147,526 and 132,080 records for service sire calving ease (SCE) and daughter calving ease (DCE) evaluations, respectively. The CE categories were ordered and scores ranged from CE1 to CE5 (CE1, easy; CE2, slight assistance; CE3, moderate assistance; CE4, difficult calving; CE5, extreme difficulty calving). A linear transformation of CE score was obtained on each category using Snell procedure, and a scaling factor was applied to attain the spread between 0 (CE5) and 100% (CE1). A sire-maternal grandsire model analysis was performed using ASREML 3.0 software package. Results: The estimated direct heritability ($h^2$) from SCE and DCE evaluations were $0.11{\pm}0.01$ and $0.08{\pm}0.01$, respectively. Maternal $h^2$ estimates were $0.05{\pm}0.02$ and $0.04{\pm}0.01$ from SCE and DCE approaches, respectively. Estimates of genetic correlations between direct and maternal genetic components were $-0.68{\pm}0.09$ (SCE) and $-0.71{\pm}0.09$ (DCE). The average direct genetic effect increased over time, whereas average maternal effect was low and consistent. The estimated direct predicted transmitting ability (PTA) was desirable and increasing over time, but the maternal PTA was undesirable and decreasing. Conclusion: The evidence on sufficient genetic variances in this study could reflect a possible selection improvement over time regarding ease of calving. It is expected that the estimated genetic parameters could be a valuable resource to formulate sire selection and breeding plans which would be directed towards the reduction of calving difficulty in Korean Holsteins."
an efficient implementation of a high-order filter for a cubed-sphere spectral element model,2017,"['Cubed-sphere grid', 'Spectral element method', 'High-order filter', 'Helmholtz equation', 'Shallow water equation']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>A parallel-scalable, isotropic, scale-selective spatial filter was developed for the cubed-sphere spectral element model on the sphere. The filter equation is a high-order elliptic (Helmholtz) equation based on the spherical Laplacian operator, which is transformed into cubed-sphere local coordinates. The Laplacian operator is discretized on the computational domain, i.e., on each cell, by the spectral element method with Gauss–Lobatto Lagrange interpolating polynomials (GLLIPs) as the orthogonal basis functions. On the global domain, the discrete filter equation yielded a linear system represented by a highly sparse matrix. The density of this matrix increases quadratically (linearly) with the order of GLLIP (order of the filter), and the linear system is solved in only  O ( <SUB>  N   g  </SUB> )  operations, where  <SUB>  N   g  </SUB>  is the total number of grid points. The solution, obtained by a row reduction method, demonstrated the typical accuracy and convergence rate of the cubed-sphere spectral element method. To achieve computational efficiency on parallel computers, the linear system was treated by an inverse matrix method (a sparse matrix–vector multiplication). The density of the inverse matrix was lowered to only a few times of the original sparse matrix without degrading the accuracy of the solution. For better computational efficiency, a local-domain high-order filter was introduced: The filter equation is applied to multiple cells, and then the central cell was only used to reconstruct the filtered field. The parallel efficiency of applying the inverse matrix method to the global- and local-domain filter was evaluated by the scalability on a distributed-memory parallel computer. The scale-selective performance of the filter was demonstrated on Earth topography. The usefulness of the filter as a hyper-viscosity for the vorticity equation was also demonstrated.</P>"
treadmill exercise produces neuroprotective effects in a murine model of parkinson’s disease by regulating the tlr2/myd88/nf-κb signaling pathway,2017,"['α-synuclein', 'inflammation', 'NADPH oxidase', 'Parkinson’s disease', 'TLR2', 'treadmill exercise']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by progressive dopamine depletion and a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc).

The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of treadmill exercise on α-synuclein-induced neuroinflammation and neuronal cell death in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model of PD. Eight weeks of treadmill exercise improved motor deficits and reduced α-synuclein expression, a major causative factor of PD-like symptoms, in MPTP mice. Treadmill exercise also down-regulated the expression of toll-like receptor 2 and its associated downstream signaling molecules, including myeloid differentiation factor-88, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6, and transforming growth factor-β-activated protein kinase 1. These effects were associated with reduced ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 expression, decreased IκBα and nuclear transcription factor-κB phosphorylation, decreased tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin-1β expression, and decreased NADPH oxidase subunit expression in the SNpc and striatum. Additionally, it promoted the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and the dopamine transporter, as well as plasma dopamine levels, in MPTP mice; these effects were associated with decreased caspase-3 expression and cleavage, as well as increased Bcl-2 expression in the SNpc.

anti-inflammatory effect of sugar-amino acid maillard reaction products on intestinal inflammation model <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>,2017,"['Sugar-amino acid MRP', 'Co-culture', 'Anti-inflammation']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>The Maillard reaction is a nonenzymatic reaction between an amino acid and a reducing sugar that usually occurs upon heating. This reaction occurs routinely in cooking, generates numerous products, which are collectively referred to as Maillard reaction products (MRPs) contributing to aroma and color features. Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) transformed from MRPs are participated in many types of inflammation reaction. In this study, various sugar-amino acid MRPs were prepared from three different amino acids (lysine, arginine, and glycine) and sugars (glucose, fructose, and galactose) for 1 h with heating at 121 °C. Treatment of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages with the MRPs decreased nitric oxide (NO) expression compared to control without MRPs treatment. MRPs derived from lysine and galactose (Lys-Gal MRPs) significantly inhibited NO expression. The retentate fraction of Lys-Gal MRPs with cut-off of molecular weight of 3–10 kDa (LGCM) suppressed NO expression more effectively than did Lys-Gal MRPs.

a stable iteration procedure of newton’s method in finite-element computation of nonlinear magnetic field problems with a vector hysteresis model,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>A stable iteration algorithm for solving nonlinear magnetic field problems using the finite-element method (FEM), incorporating a vector Jiles-Atherton hysteresis model and Newton's method, is introduced. The Jacobian matrix is calculated according to the information of the differential reluctivity of the hysteresis loops. In order to balance the FEM computation stability and efficiency, two time criteria are adopted. The proposed FEM procedure is applied to analyze a three-phase transformer made of electrical steel sheets. The numerical computation is stable and fast. The numerically computation results are compared with the experimentally measured ones. The computation efficiency and accuracy proves the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</P>"

Applying a Sliding Mode Fuzzy Control (SMFC) scheme, the designed controller causes the closed-loopsystem converging to the sliding surface and achieving the required control performance. For the control performance,the concepts of stability, individual state variance and passivity constraints are introduced for the slidingmode fuzzy control system. To apply convex optimal programming algorithm, some sufficient conditions derivedin this paper are reduced to Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problem. At last, two simulation examples are proposedto demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of the proposed design method. One of the examples is to discussthe conservatism of this paper. Another is to show that the discrete truck-trailer system controlled by sliding modefuzzy controller can achieve stability constraints, individual state variance constraints and passivity constraints."
realizing the empirical mode decomposition by the adaptive stochastic resonance in a new periodical model and its application in bearing fault diagnosis,2017,"['Empirical mode decomposition', 'Adaptive stochastic resonance', 'Bearing fault diagnosis', 'Random particle swarm optimization algorithm']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"We investigate a multi-frequency signal that cannot be decomposed by empirical mode decomposition directly. Moreover, this kind of signal in the noisy background cannot be decomposed successfully by the traditional stochastic resonance with bistable system yet. We propose a new method which using the empirical mode decomposition combined the adaptive stochastic resonance in a new periodical model to solve this problem. The results show that the proposed method decomposes the multi-frequency signal perfectly. Meanwhile, the general scale transformation and random particle swarm optimization algorithm are used to help obtain a better result in the process of optimization. Through using this new method, the simulation results are satisfactory. More importantly, this new method also shows good performance in the application of bearing fault diagnosis."
oral administration of red ginseng powder fermented with probiotic alleviates the severity of dextran-sulfate sodium-induced colitis in a mouse model,2017,"['Colitis', 'Fermentation', 'Inflammation', 'Probiotics', 'Red ginseng']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Red ginseng is a well-known alternative medicine with anti-inflammatory activity. It exerts pharmacological effects through the transformation of saponin into metabolites by intestinal microbiota. Given that intestinal microflora vary among individuals, the pharmacological effects of red ginseng likely vary among individuals. In order to produce homogeneously effective red ginseng, we prepared probiotic-fermented red ginseng and evaluated its activity using a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model in mice. Initial analysis of intestinal damage indicated that the administration of probiotic-fermented red ginseng significantly decreased the severity of colitis, compared with the control and the activity was higher than that induced by oral administration of ginseng powder or probiotics only. Subsequent analysis of the levels of serum IL-6 and TNF-alpha, inflammatory biomarkers that are increased at the initiation stage of colitis, were significantly decreased in probiotic-fermented red ginseng-treated groups in comparison to the control group. The levels of inflammatory cytokines and mRNAs for inflammatory factors in colorectal tissues were also significantly decreased in probiotic-fermented red ginseng-treated groups. Collectively, oral administration of probiotic-fermented red ginseng reduced the severity of colitis in a mouse model, suggesting that it can be used as a uniformly effective red ginseng product.</P>"

In other words, the respect for autonomy or self-determination is understood as ensuring an independent self-determination by the subject with sufficient decision-making ability. That is, under any circumstances, the subject has an independent authority to decide on his own business without being disturbed. However, such a tendency to understand rights to self-determination as narrow privacy rights does not have a practical alternative to how it can be realized other than to declare that everyone has the right to self-determination, by returning the nature of self-determination to the passive right of the individual. Therefore, the recognition of the concept of autonomy, which is concentrated on the self-determination ability, should be newly transformed, and the justification of autonomy should be shifted from the procedural level to the substantive level. This article proposes the autonomy capability model in order to overcome the narrowness of autonomy and self-determination and discuss the applicability of this model. Based on these research goals, this paper has the following structure. First, the autonomy capability model is based on conceptual and methodological basis of Martha Nussbaum's capability approach, so this approach is introduced within the necessary range. Then, after explaining the basic concepts and core issues of the autonomy capability model, the significance of this model is examined in terms of substantive justification of rights to self-determination. In addition, the adult guardianship system can be justified from the standpoint of autonomy capability model, and the legal philosophical search for active management of the adult guardianship system is attempted. Finally, the legal philosophical implications of this model are mentioned."

Recently, new types of retails have emerged in retail industries. Therefore, trade area platform has developed focusing on the speed of data, no longer trade area from district border. Besides, ‘trade area smart’ brings about change in retail types with the development of giga internet. Thus, context shopping is changing the way of consumers’ purchase pattern through data capture, technology capability, and algorithm development. For these reasons, the sales estimation model has been shown to be flawed using the notion of former scale and time, and it is necessary to construct a new model.Research design, data, and methodology – This study focuses on measuring retail change in large multi-shopping mall for the outlook for retail industry and competition for trade area with the theoretical background understanding of retail store types and overall domestic retail conditions. The competition among retail store types are strong, whereas the borders among them are fading. There is a greater need to analyze on a new model because sales expectation can be hard to get with business area competition.

Shepard)의 의하면, 대상에 대한 지각은 보다 능숙하게 혹은 덜 능숙한 시각적 적응을 내재한다. 이러한 특성은 환경, 경험, 지식과 연관된 친숙함으로부터 발생하는데 보는 방법이 대상의 정체를 식별하기 위한 시도이자 주체화된 탐색이라는 점에서 앎의 영향권을 논의한다. 또한, ‘재현의 맥락화’ 는 관찰자의 앎과 지식이 암묵적으로 반영되고 이를 읽고 해석하는 주체의 배경이 상대적일 뿐 더러 즉각적이고 효율적인 방향을 지향하는 인지적 결정임을 명시한다. 대상을 정보적 체계로 규합하는 지각의 성질은 환경에 대한 최적의 반응이며 이들이 행위에 의해 일어나고 학습된다는 점에서 ‘학습적 지각’의 속성을 지닌다. 또한, ‘감각 정보’, ‘인지 정보’, 그리고 ‘지식 정보’는 지각적 패턴의 구조적 변경을 일으키는 원인이자 지각의 밑거름이 된다고 할 수 있는데, 이들의 연합은 현재의 사건으로부터 과거의 정보를 가져오거나 미래에 대한 예측 아래 구조적으로 작동한다. 특히, 정보적 지각은 대상에 대한 다양한 패턴 생성을 일으키며, 인지 작용을 통해 기존의 지각 정보의 패턴을 수정하고 개조하는 ‘다운 톱’(Down-top: 지식이 감각에 영향을 미치는)의 경로를 가진다. 그러므로 정보의 의미나 가치에 대한 주체의 의사결정은 주체가 대상에 대해 탐색한 신호에 대한 선택이자, 이들을 규합하고 통합한 인지적 성공의 일종으로 간주된다. 결론적으로, 이러한 지각 모델은 인지 작용이 정보 처리의 유연함에 기초한 열린 설계라는 점을 제시 할 뿐 아니라 현대인의 지각적 특성이 ‘낯익음’ 보다는 ‘낯설기’를 선호하며 그 이유를 감각 정보의 ‘정점 변경’ 및 ‘임계점’을 통해 새로운 경험의 변형이 지속적으로 일어난다는 점에서 정보적 지각의 특성을 문화적 변이의 원인으로 설명하고 있다.","A study on property of perception model suggests that ‘how we perceive objects’, which is based on ‘cognitive-neuro aesthetics’. Firstly, it is said that seeing depends on interaction between sensation and cognition. According to R. Shepard, our seeing is worked as her and his own ‘visual adoption’ in state of being proficient or inexperienced and quality of visual adoption comes from familiarity of knowledge, experience, and environment like background. When we see forms, shapes, colors, textures of objects, representation (mental image) in a brain that concords with making decision immediately and efficiently in a way that we distinguish an identity. Secondly, our perceiving performs playing a role as organizing system mingled with information. Scientists say that informative perception can be ‘learning perception’, if we have an optimum response such as liking or disgusting objects in term of feeling negative or positive. In a line with this, ‘sensational information’, ‘cognitive information’ and ‘knowledge information’, these work as a forming basement of our perception. And also, association of these brings information of the past into some events of the present or works together in an area of prediction of the future. All being perceived are remained in sub-consciousness with memory. Especially, influences of learning and memory get accelerating transformed experience, if we are learning something new or confronting the strangers.

Also, it aims to help youth belong to the community of faith successfully by offering systematic practices and training. The problem of youth baptism education and ceremony is that it is practiced formally and superficially. Another problem is the church’s closeness and exclusiveness, which runs counter to the current youth culture as characterized by change and diversity. To cope with this problem, a new educational model is suggested in order to update and renew the baptismal education and ceremonies of youth. Adolescence is a time when mutual communication is possible as an opportunity for change, growth and maturity. Moreover, it is possible to participate in public affairs related to people and make moral judgments based on objective truth. It is also a time for them to understand the abstract principles of developmental psychology, to expand the theological thinking that enables logical and concrete manipulation, and to interpret themselves to form their self-identity. For this reason, church leaders and adults are required to focus on intellectual research on doctrine, invitation, fellowship, and care for youth by providing theological and moral customs based on relationships, helping them experience a sense of belonging by honest communication, and critically reflecting on social problems. Above all, youth needs to be encouraged to set the goal of “unlimited love” as a Christian’s calling in the process of reaching adulthood. It is highly likely that baptismal education and ceremony are effective tools within the educational models in that they can offer the chance for youth to learn and realize the necessary values and qualities mentioned above. Therefore, this paper examines baptism from biblical and theological perspectives and analyzes the order and meaning of baptismal education and ceremony within the early church. Finally, it designs the revised and renewed model of baptismal ceremony for youth through the insights gained from various researches. The structure of the model consists of pre-education of baptism, rite of baptism, and post-education of baptism. First, pre-education teaches teenagers worship, learning, prayer, and life style. Second, the rite of baptism is an empirical learning of tradition and doctrine. Last, post-education of baptism is a continuing education that explains the meaning of the baptismal order and conveys norms and practices. In times of career focus and other distractions, renewing baptism is a significant and valuable educational mission for faith formation to youth. Therefore, baptismal education must be prepared and practiced thoroughly and meaningfully."

수학적 모델을 이용한 순열과 조합 단원의 실생활 문제해결에 관한 연구,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"This study aims for a mathematical modeling for korean students, who lack not only the problem solving skill for real-life problems because they are accustomed to formal curricula but also the interest because mathematics is considered to be too abstract and not related to everyday real life. Especially, the students rely heavily on the application of formulas when they do routine problems in the ‘Permutation and Combination’ chapter. Thus students have a difficulty in problems that require modification of the formulas. By solving real-life problems in the ‘Permutation and Combination’ chapter with mathematical modeling, students are expected to gain a better understanding of the mathematical concepts and the ability to grasp the essence of the problems. For this purpose, the following study objectives were established:1. Real life problems on ‘Permutation and Combination’ are classified into categories according to the problem types. 2. Real life problems on ‘Permutation and Combination’ are presented to the students through mathematical models after problems are transformed mutually among the different problem types.Among the ‘Permutation and Combination’ real life problems, distribution problems were the most common (36.1%), followed by selection (33.3%), selection + distribution (19.4%) and division (11.1%) problems. This process can help the students recognize the usefulness of mathematics and appreciate the appeal and utility of the subject. Moreover, converting practice into another types will help students to develop grasping ability of the essence of the problems related to ‘Permutation and Combination’ without the dependence on mathematical formulas."

It looks at how the Korean film industry, despite its ongoing conflicts with Hollywood and resistance to it, largely achieved its success by emulating Hollywood films and its industrial practices. As a result, even while Hollywood domination of the Korean market declined amid Korean films` success, the way the Korean film industry transformed revealed profound Hollywood influence. This indicated the fundamental limits of its challenge to Hollywood, while also creating some vexing dilemmas for the Korean film industry, especially the question of cultural diversity and the screen quota. Yet, being wary of uncritically celebrating or dismissing the Korean film industry`s success as a case of challenge or submission to Hollywood power, it suggests recognizing the complexities of the developments within the Korean film industry as well as its shifting relationship with Hollywood in the context of globalization."

The purpose begin with, raising the questions, ‘What is the current status of and understand basic in Christian multicultural education in Korean churches?’ ‘Why could Forster’s educational theory of multicultural communities of faith be the alternative?’and this study deals with the background of the multicultural community of faith presented by Foster’s and the framework of education. I sought to derive education models of his multicultural community of faith from the visions of existing together, practicing together, hoping together. and I reinterpreted Foster’s theory and described actual programs(Christian multicultural education models) applicable to situations within the Korean society and Korean churches for the Christian people in ecclesial communities in Korea. The results obtained through this research are as follows: First, the studies on Christian multicultural education based on multicultural communities of faith presented by Foster’s will lead to the education designed to bring about a new awareness especially to Christian multicultural education and Christian education in Korean churches in forms of education including community, different ways of life, the embrace of diversity, and hospitality, unlike conventional education focusing mainly on knowledge acquisition, such as professor-based instruction, school-based education, etc. Secondly, this study based on Foster’s education theory is not a study accepting indiscriminately or denouncing western theories, but a study suitable for situations in Korean society and the reality of Korean churches with a holistic perspective. It can be presented as a study which may establish a system of Christian multicultural education in relation to the divided states on the Korean peninsula, such as part of the unification education and Christian education for North Korean defectors. It can also be seen as a basic theory of multicultural ministry which forms the perfect blend of theory and practice, such as new institutions, pastoral approaches, redevelopment of multicultural ministries, and pastoral counseling. Thirdly, this study can present directions for Christian multicultural education to prepare for globalization that bring regions and the world together. It can be considered as an alternative method of recovering churches again as the place of the public community and making them coexist with their regions and neighbors beyond their internal dimension through education connected to communities including residential and commercial areas and to other relevant communities or local organizations. Finally, this study will provide alternative pathways for problems and for the status of Christian education in relation to the challenges of multicultural societies that Korean churches are facing. Now I am hoping this study will be a paper acting as the pump priming water to give directions and points of application to Korean churches through Christian multicultural education and ministries."
how social media is transforming the fashion consumers: the effects of “social” consumer attributes on brand engagement in social networking sites,2017,"['brand relationship', 'social consumers', 'social media', 'social networking sites']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The proliferation of social media has given rise to the new consumer group, namely, social consumers. This study identified the distinct characteristics of social consumers (i.e., online social search, online social navigation, online social connection) and examined the impacts of social consumer attributes on the engagement with fashion brands via brands` SNSs (BSNSs). A sample of 141 U.S. consumers who had browsed and/or participated in a fashion brand`s BSNS (i.e., the Facebook page for fashion brands) was used to examine hypothesized relationships. The analyses involved running a confirmatory factor analysis and a structural equation modeling. The result indicates that the impacts of the social consumer attributes on the benefits of BSNSs (i.e., experiential and functional benefits) as perceived by consumers were significant, except the link between online social connection and functional benefits. In addition, consumers` existing relationship with a brand served as a moderating variable, strengthening the impacts of social consumer attributes on BSNS benefits. The perceived benefits of BSNSs positively affected perceived relationship investment which in turn influenced brand loyalty. Practical marketing suggestions are provided for fashion brands."

Several climatic studies focused on different downscaling techniques for climatological parameters of different regions. For statistical downscaling of any hydrological parameters, conventional Neural Network Models were used in common. However, it seems that in any modeling study, uncertainty is a vital aspect when making any predictions about the performance. In this paper, Gamma Test is performed to determine the data length selection for training to minimize the uncertainty in model development. Another measure to improve the data quality and model development are wavelet transforms. Hence, Gamma Test with Wavelet decomposed Feedforward Neural Network (GT-WNN) model is developed and tested for downscaled land surface temperature of Patna Urban, Bihar. The results of GT-WNN model are compared with GT-FFNN and conventional Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) model. The effectiveness of the developed models is illustrated by Root Mean Square Error and Coefficient of Correlation. Results showed that GT-WNN outperformed the GT-FFNN and conventional FFNN in downscaling the land surface temperature. The land surface temperature is forecasted for a period of 2015-2044 with GT-WNN model for Patna Urban in Bihar. In addition, the significance of the probable changes in the land surface temperature is also found through Mann-Kendall (M-K) Test for Summer, Winter, Monsoon and Post Monsoon seasons. Results showed an increasing surface temperature trend for summer and winter seasons and no significant trend for monsoon and post monsoon season over the study area for the period between 2015 and 2044. Overall, the M-K test analysis for the annual data shows an increasing trend in the land surface temperature of Patna Urban."

These kind of problems are solved by the virtual sensing methods in various engineering fields. Virtual sensing technology is a technology that can measure data even though there is no physical sensor. It is expected that this technology can be also applied to the construction field effectively. In this study, a virtual sensing technology based on ARX model is proposed. An ARX model is defined by using the simulated data through a structural analysis rather than by actually measured data. The ARX-based virtual sensing model can be applied to estimate unmeasured response using a transfer function that defines the relationship between two point data. In this study, a simulation and experimental study were carried out to examine the proposed virtual sensing method with a laboratory test on a cable-stayed model bridge. Acceleration measured at a girder is transformed to estimate a cable tension through the ARX model-based virtual sensing."

Therefore, a new method for robustly detecting road boundaries on crowded roads is presented in this paper. First, road-boundary detection using a standard Hough transform is described, and its limitations are shown. Second, the cause of the limitations is explained by the measurement model of a laser scanner. Then, the standard Hough transform is modified to reflect the measurement model of the laser scanner; this change reduces the effect of closed obstacles. Finally, the proposed method is tested in the real-world environment, and it shows better performance than previous works in crowded environments."
error modeling for sensitivity analysis and calibration of the tri-pyramid parallel robot,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Developments in machine tooling technology are driven by a demand for high-precision machining of various materials. However, high-precision machining using a kinematic model with nominal values is associated with inaccuracy as the machine errors are not accounted for. Therefore, it is important to precisely determine the machine error factors to produce an accurate error model. Complex models that use iterative calculation in the calibration process are time-consuming and resource-intensive. In this paper, a simplified error model was applied to a translational parallel tri-pyramid robot with three degrees of freedom (DOF). The sources of kinematic error were joint errors, kinematic parameter errors, and actuator control errors; 90 errors were identified in total. The full error model was defined using a linearized homogeneous transformation matrix (HTM) and the Denevit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters. The 27 dominant error sources affecting the accuracy of the platform position were selected by a sensitivity analysis method. After the error reduction model based on these sources was established, the calibration was performed by simulation. The calibration simulation results suggest that the model accuracy could be improved from 0.85 to 0.26 mm.</P>"

The hourly SWH values for two buoy stations located in the North Atlantic Ocean were applied to train and validate the WGP model. For this purpose, the SWH main time series was decomposed into some subseries using wavelet transform and then decomposed time series were imported to GP model to forecast the SWH. Furthermore, GP approach was independently used to the same data set for comparison purposes. Performance of the WGP model was evaluated using correlation coefficient (R), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), index of agreement (Ia) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The analysis proved that the model accuracy is highly depended on the decomposition levels. The obtained results showed that WGP model is able to forecast the SWH with a high reliability."

Nearly random distribution of austenitic orientation exhibited a distinguished flow curve from the others with a major D {4 4 11} 11 11 8  component due to more gradual enhancement of hardening by less martensitic transformation. In order to compare the susceptibility to the transformation with respect to individual austenitic orientations and the experimental textures, interaction energy between the imposed stress and transformation strain was calculated by a classical transformation and a crystal plasticity model. The results indicated that a larger stress imposed on the D component led to higher interaction energy and a steeper progress of MIMT observed in the textured materials.</P>"

Furthermore, a sufficient space between equipment should be provided for the operability, maintainability, and safety. To guarantee suitable arrangement design, there are many requirements to be considered such as international codes and standards, including owners’ own requirements. Meanwhile, the arrangement design of an offshore topside tends to rely on experts’ knowledge and experiences. Due to the heavy dependence on experts’ knowledge and experiences, consequently, a different arrangement can be derived according to a personal disposition, in spite of the same requirements. In addition, an unacceptable arrangement can be derived due to the omission of some requirements by a designer. To solve such problems, an expert system for the arrangement design of an offshore topside was proposed based on an arrangement evaluation model (AEM) in this study by expanding the previous study of authors for the arrangement design of a submarine. In addition, an arrangement template model (ATM) was proposed to store various data on the arrangement design of the offshore topside.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of Yongdamsagan-tang (YST) extracts and confirm effects on autoimmune hepatitis models as the therapeutic agent using the YST extracted by various solvents. YST, a mixture of 11 herbal extracts, is known in traditional Korean medicine as a widely used treatment for inflammatory diseases. We proposed the AIH-condition in vitro model by the addition of recombinant IL-17A and then observed several markers linked to AIH symptoms, including an increase of IL-6 expression, lipid accumulation, and fibrosis. In AIH-condition hepatic cell model, YST reduced IL-6 expression and lipid accumulation caused by treatment of IL-17 combination in hepatocyte cells. Also, YST blocked several activated fibrosis factors including transforming growth factor-β (TGF- β1), collagen type 1 (Col-α1(I)), and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in liver stellate cells. Furthermore, pretreatment with YST protected hepatic damage and reduces histological injury by suppressing apoptosis mediator and inflammatory cytokines expression in concanavalin A (Con A)-induced autoimmune hepatitis mice model. The findings here improve our understanding of YST extracted by 80% ethanol, suggesting that YST can be used as a therapeutic treatment for AIH.</P>"

Examples show that forcing the reduced-order modelto retain the steady-state component does not compromise the transient accuracy."

Also, more efficient estimations than WLS have been suggested such as Bayesian methods (Cepeda and Achcar, 2009) and semiparametric methods (Kim and Ma, 2012) in heteroscedastic error models. Recently, Çelik (2015) proposed the weight methods applicable to the heteroscedasticity patterns including butterfly-distributed residuals and megaphone-shaped residuals.

The minimization based SFS is presented to retrieve the 3D digital surface from the milled workpiece. The dual tree complex wavelet transform is adopted to enhance SFS such that the interfering noise can be suppressed. In the end, quantitative surface roughness indicators are utilized to estimate the surface roughness numerically. A milling cutting experiment of aero-material of aluminum alloy 7075 was carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The ductile fracture criterion couples effect of stress triaxiality on void growth, and assumes the shear linking-up of voids governed by the largest shear stress. The criterion is developed based on an isotropic strain rate potential computed from an isotropic damage equivalent strain rate vector, which is mapped from the plastic strain rate vector by a forth order linear transformation tensor. The proposed anisotropic ductile fracture criterion is applied to depict anisotropic ductile fracture of AA 6K21 in shear, uniaxial tension and plane strain tension along different loading directions, and the balanced biaxial tension. The predicted fracture strain and fracture locus are compared with experimental results for the verification of the proposed criterion. The comparison demonstrates that the ductile fracture criterion properly models the anisotropy in ductile fracture under shear, uniaxial tension, plane strain tension and balanced biaxial tension with high accuracy.

The proposed system applies Random Sample Consensus to find the best model of road lanes passing through divided regions of the input image under HSV color model. HSV color model is chosen since it explicitly separates chromaticity and luminosity and the narrower hue distribution greatly assists in later segmentation of the frames by limiting color saturation.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is capable of providing enhanced information regarding the soft tissues, and therefore MR images are included in the proposed approach.

Such communications are possible when the followers are impressed by the challenges of leadership behaviors. In this sense, the servant leadership model has been playing the major roles to make the impressive influences on the followers. This article divides the leadership eras in history into three parts: leadership 1.0, leadership 2.0, and leadership 3.0. The new leadership model, as leadership 3.0 in this age, has emerged to response the innovative environments of high-technology-oriented and hyper-connected society with the new perspectives of the complexity science. In addition to the classification of the leadership ears, the model of servant leadership is introduced to explain the characteristics of the changes of leadership paradigms. Particularly, the new model of servant leadership for the situation 3.0 is suggested through contextualizing the previous model of servant leadership by Greenleaf for the cross-cultural postmodern environments of the otherness. This modeling aims at the trans effects, which causes the followers’ voluntary commitments to the leadership structure. The trans effects are usually produced by the trans-leadership model that autonomously transfigures their own leadership paradigms to challenge the followers’ affectiveness to be led by the servant leaders, and to transform the organizations and the societies eventually. The trans effects by the servant leadership model is a kind of phenomena of reframing of leadership, which provokes the contextualization of leadership by the vertical shifts in terms of the old model of servant leadership, and by the horizontal shifts in terms of the new one of servant leadership. The suggestions of the new model of servant leadership in this article is based upon the Pauline scriptures in 1Cor 9."

implementation of unscented transform to estimate the uncertainty of a liquid flow standard system,2017,"['Liquid flow standard system', 'Measurement uncertainty', 'Unscented transform']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"First-order partial derivatives of a mathematical model are an essential part of evaluating the measurement uncertainty of a liquid ow standard system according to the Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement (GUM). Although the GUM provides a straightforward method to evaluate the measurement uncertainty of volume flow rate, the first-order partial derivatives can be complicated. The mathematical model of volume flow rate in a liquid flow standard system has a cross-correlation between liquid density and buoyancy correction factor. This cross-correlation can make derivation of the first-order partial derivatives difficult. Monte Carlo simulation can be used as an alternative method to circumvent the difficulty in partial derivation. However, the Monte Carlo simulation requires large computational resources for a correct simulation because it considers the completeness issue whether an ideal or a real operator conducts an experiment to evaluate the measurement uncertainty. Thus, the Monte Carlo simulation needs a large number of samples to ensure that the uncertainty evaluation is as close to the GUM as possible. Unscented transform can alleviate this problem because unscented transform can be regarded as a Monte Carlo simulation with an infinite number of samples. This idea means that unscented transform considers the uncertainty evaluation with respect to the ideal operator. Thus, unscented transform can evaluate the measurement uncertainty the same as the uncertainty that the GUM provides."

It is possible for designers to imagine free from the product form which was limited to the molding technology. The purpose of this study is to propose an archetype of forms that can be produced by 3D printing technology through the geometric based form study. In order to explore new form possibility, this study was conducted with two perspectives: shapes structured with plane and dimension formed from line based on Euclidean geometry and topology. Then, the principle of transformation of shapes and dimensions was investigated because this study interpreted one of the principles of design creative activity as a continuous transformation of a form to express balance, harmony and rhythm. Based on this, this study proposes an archetype design model that can simulate possibilities of various forms generated from the dimension formed with line(s) of knot and link theory which are one area of topology. This archetype design model was designed based on parametric 3D modeling using Grasshopper on Rhinoceros to simulate various design formations generated in the dimension formed by the line, away from the approach of structuring forms with planes and faces. This study will contribute to widening the formative imagination of designers in 3D printing based production environment."
transformation of zinc-concentrate in surface and subsurface environments: implications for assessing zinc mobility/toxicity and choosing an optimal remediation strategy,2017,"['Sphalerite', 'Heavy metal contamination', 'Acid extraction', 'Mineral transformation', 'XAFS']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Zinc contamination in near- and sub-surface environments is a serious threat to many ecosystems and to public health. Sufficient understanding of Zn speciation and transport mechanisms is therefore critical to evaluating its risk to the environment and to developing remediation strategies. The geochemical and mineralogical characteristics of contaminated soils in the vicinity of a Zn ore transportation route were thoroughly investigated using a variety of analytical techniques (sequential extraction, XRF, XRD, SEM, and XAFS). Imported Zn-concentrate (ZnS) was deposited in a receiving facility and dispersed over time to the surrounding roadside areas and rice-paddy soils. Subsequent physical and chemical weathering resulted in dispersal into the subsurface. The species identified in the contaminated areas included Zn-sulfide, Zn-carbonate, other O-coordinated Zn-minerals, and Zn species bound to Fe/Mn oxides or clays, as confirmed by XAFS spectroscopy and sequential extraction. The observed transformation from S-coordinated Zn to O-coordinated Zn associated with minerals suggests that this contaminant can change into more soluble and labile forms as a result of weathering. For the purpose of developing a soil washing remediation process, the contaminated samples were extracted with dilute acids. The extraction efficiency increased with the increase of O-coordinated Zn relative to S-coordinated Zn in the sediment. This study demonstrates that improved understanding of Zn speciation in contaminated soils is essential for well-informed decision making regarding metal mobility and toxicity, as well as for choosing an appropriate remediation strategy using soil washing.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  Zn-concentrate accumulated in soils transformed to Zn species of various stability. </LI> <LI>  Zn species at our site underwent the transformation from Zn sulfides → O-coordinated Zn. </LI> <LI>  XAFS/sequential extraction showed a correlation between acid extractability and Zn speciation. </LI> <LI>  Metal speciation enables a better assessment of metal mobility/toxicity and the choice of an optimal remediation strategy. </LI> </UL> </P>   <P><B>Graphical abstract</B></P>  <P>Graphical Abstract.

modeling adsorption properties of structurally deformed metal–organic frameworks using structure–property map,2017,['metal&#x2013'],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Structural deformation and collapse in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) can lead to loss of long-range order, making it a challenge to model these amorphous materials using conventional computational methods. In this work, we show that a structure-property map consisting of simulated data for crystalline MOFs can be used to indirectly obtain adsorption properties of structurally deformed MOFs. The structure-property map (with dimensions such as Henry coefficient, heat of adsorption, and pore volume) was constructed using a large data set of over 12000 crystalline MOFs from molecular simulations. By mapping the experimental data points of deformed SNU-200, MOF-5, and Ni-MOF-74 onto this structure-property map, we show that the experimentally deformed MOFs share similar adsorption properties with their nearest neighbor crystalline structures. Once the nearest neighbor crystalline MOFs for a deformed MOF are selected from a structure-property map at a specific condition, then the adsorption properties of these MOFs can be successfully transformed onto the degraded MOFs, leading to a new way to obtain properties of materials whose structural information is lost.</P>"

Natural frequencies, modes and critical fluid velocity of the pipelines on different supports are analyzed based on Timoshenko model by using DTM and ADM in this study. At first, the governing differential equations of motion of fluid conveying Timoshenko pipeline in free vibration are derived. Parameter for the nondimensionalized multiplication factor for the fluid velocity is incorporated into the equations of motion in order to investigate its effects on the natural frequencies. For solution, the terms are found directly from the analytical solution of the differential equation that describes the deformations of the cross-section according to Timoshenko beam theory. After the analytical solution, the efficient and easy mathematical techniques called DTM and ADM are used to solve the governing differential equations of the motion, respectively. The calculated natural frequencies of fluid conveying Timoshenko pipelines with various combinations of boundary conditions using DTM and ADM are tabulated in several tables and figures and are compared with the results of Analytical Method (ANM) where a very good agreement is observed. Finally, the critical fluid velocities are calculated for different boundary conditions and the first five mode shapes are presented in graphs."

molecular-like transformation from phse-protected au<sub>25</sub> to au<sub>23</sub> nanocluster and its application,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>In this work, we report a new size conversion from [Au-25(SePh)(18)](-) to [Au-23(SePh)(16)](-) nanoclusters under the reductive condition (NaBH4). This novel transformation induced by only reductant has not been reported before in the field of gold nanocluster. The conversion process is studied via MALDI mass spectrometry, and UV-vis spectroscopy. These results demonstrate that the [Au-23(SePh)(16)](-) nanocluster is directly obtained by pulling out two units of 'Au-SeR' from the [Au-25(SePh)(18)](-) nanocluster, which is similar to the 'small molecular' reaction. In order to further understand this novel conversion, DFT calculations were performed, in which, with addition of two H- in the [Au-25(SeH)(18)](-) model, two Au atoms will depart from the structure of the [Au-25(SeH)(18)](-), which is consistent with the experimental results. Furthermore, the as prepared [Au-23(SePh)(16)](-) nanoclusters can be converted into [Au-25(PET)(18)](-) nanocluster (PET = SCH2CH2Ph) with excess PET under the reductive condition, which is quite remarkable due to a stronger bond of Au-Se in comparison to Au-S of the final product. Interestingly, the number of the PET ligands on the surface of the 25-atoms nanocluster can be controlled by the addition of the reductant. Based on these results, a circularly progressive mechanism of ligand exchange is proposed. This may offer a new approach to synthesis of new gold nanoclusters and also have significant contribution for understanding and further exploration of the mechanism of ligand exchange.</P>"

Thus, this paper proposes a new framework that can measure the performance of the GHough quantitatively.

Although traditional insider treat detection methods focus on the rule-based approaches built by domain knowledge of experts, it turns out that they are neither flexible nor robust. Recently, machine learning-based approaches have been highlighted as an alternative to rule-based approaches because data driven detection system can be more applicable to actual systems. To do so, we first design the user behavior model that transforms log records of user activities, inappropriate for machine learning algorithms, into numerical vectors to encode user behaviors to instances. Then we apply variable selection methods and novelty detection algorithms to efficiently detect the rare insider treats or malicious (suspicious) activities. Experimental results support that the proposed framework can work well for severally imbalanced data sets in which there are only a few insider threats although no domain experts’ knowledge is provided."

eventual chemical transformation of metals and chalcogens into metal chalcogenide nanoplates through a surface nucleation-detachment-reorganization mechanism,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Many studies have reported the synthesis of two-dimensional (2D) nanoplates and nanosheets of the layer-structured metal chalcogenides but also have reported various structures far from the 2D shape. In multicomponent compounds, the elemental concentrations keep changing during the reaction; hence, the reactions are considered to be nonstoichiometric from the nucleation and may include continuous changes in the structure and composition. The different shapes of the metal chalcogenides with the layered structure are attributed to the nonstoichiometric reactions. However, it has not been studied if such nonstoichiometric reactions eventually produce 2D nanoplates, and the mechanism involved in the transformation has not been understood. This study investigates a two-step chemical reaction as an extreme nonstoichiometric nucleation and growth. It reveals that the layer -structured metal chalcogenides (M2X3, M = Sb and Bi, X = Se and Te) with the R (3) over barm space group can be obtained by transforming premade pure chalcogen (Se, Te) thick nanorods or metal microparticles (Bi). By coupling our first-principles calculations with a shape -prediction thermodynamic model, we have also examined and rationalized the shape/aspect ratio of the M2X3 nanocrystals under different experimental growth conditions. The tendency of anisotropic growth to form the 2D shapes during the transformations are discussed on the basis of experimental results and theoretical calculations.</P>"

KSHV primarily infects endothelial and B cells in vivo, and is associated with at least three malignancies: Kaposi's sarcoma and two B cell lymphomas, respectively. Although KSHV readily infects endothelial cells in vitro and thus its pathogenic mechanisms have been extensively studied, B cells had been refractory to KSHV infection. As such, functions of KSHV genes have mostly been elucidated in endothelial cells in the context of viral infection but not in B cells. Whether KSHV oncogenes, defined in endothelial cells, play the same roles in the tumorigenesis of B cells remains an open question. Only recently, through a few ground-breaking studies, B cell infection models have been established. In this review, those models will be compared and contrasted and putative mechanisms of KSHV-induced B cell transformation will be discussed.</P>"

In comparison to an existing method of product life cycle curve forecasting with evolutionary parametric drivers (Sandborn’s method), the proposed method can predict life cycle curves effectively while overcoming the limitations (requiring evolutionary parametric drivers, and assumption of Gaussian distribution) of the Sendborn’s method.

At the age of crisis I try to research what is the desirable leaders and teachers and what is the best model for the leaders. This paper explores a new way of solving such problems the Korean churches are facing. It attempts to discover the archetypal example of educator in William Baird who was the founder of Soong-sil University in order to pursue a new paradigm of transforming the Korean society and the direction in which the Christian schools move forward. Also, I will suggest that we may want to consider Baird as a leadership model to follow for both the Korean church and society. The aim of this paper is to offer lessons for the Korean church to consider worthwhile by studying the contributions Baird made to Korea by establishing the modern private school for the first time and pioneering the Korean mission."

On the purpose to quantitatively analyze the research trend of KSRP’s publications with the viewpoint of SDGs, the qualitative documents of 17 SDGs and 771 publications were mathematically transformed into vectors and the similarity was numerically measured with the ‘Vector Space Model(VSM)’. The results show that ‘Sustainable cities and communities(SDG 11)’, ‘Zero hunger(SDG 2)’, ‘Life on land(SDG 15)’ and ‘Responsible consumption and production(SDG 12)’ have strong relationships with KSRP, while those of ‘Affordable and clean energy(SDG 7)’, ‘Peace, justice and strong institution(SDG 16)’ and ‘Gender equality(SDG 5)’ are weak. It is also found that the relationships of KSRP publications with ‘energy’ and ‘climate change’ issues(SDG 7, 13) were greatly increased during the period of 1995-2016, in spite of their weak relationships."

This technology is called 4D printing. To make this technology any useful, there should be a design tool that can calculate the initial 3D printed shape with proper material compositions that will transform into the final shape after being exposed to the stimulation. In this study, we present a mathematical foundation based on polygonal model planarization. The proposed method is quite similar to the parameterization problem in computer graphics but it is more difficult because of the added constraint that all basic elements that constitute the 3D printed initial shape need to expand to reach the final shape. The expansion rate can vary among the elements and this is physically realizable by controlling the mixing ratio of two materials of different expansion ratios. Also, we calculated the angle of the edge that also modified with respect to the vertex as it was flattened. Finally, we proposed a 4D printing structure that can be transformed into a 3D shape using expansion rate and distortion angle of edges."
power characteristics of spinel cathodes correlated with elastic softness and phase transformation for high-power lithium-ion batteries,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The power characteristics of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are crucial for the advent of commercialized, high-power applications, such as electric vehicles. Through both first-principles multiscale simulations and experiments, here, we present fundamental understanding on the power characteristics of the high-voltage spinel cathode correlated with its elastic softness and phase transformation in nanodomains for high-power LIBs. Atomic models of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 and LiNi0.5Mn1.5-xTixO4 are developed for multiscale phase field modeling based on structural information for the as-prepared nanopowders. The combined computational and experimental investigations suggest that the thermodynamic phase stability of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 can be effectively enhanced by the incorporation of Ti into the structure without any change to the redox mechanism. Ti incorporation provides a faster ionic mobility and the improved phase stability because of the reinforced Ti4+-O bonds. Based on the multiscale phase transformation kinetics, LiNi0.5Mn1.5-xTixO4 exhibits an enhanced elastic softness and slower phase separation than LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 in the nanodomain during Li+ insertion and extraction. Such characteristics are mainly responsible for the improved electrochemical performance at higher current rates, as confirmed by electrochemical experiments. This fundamental understanding of the power characteristics with respect to the correlations with elastic softness and phase transformation will provide a guideline to develop and design advanced materials for high-power LIBs.</P>"
fault detection based on polygon area statistics of transformation matrix identified from combined moving window data,2017,"['Principal Component Analysis', 'Combined Moving Window', 'Polygon Area', 'Real-time Process Monitoring', 'Fault Detection']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Principal component analysis (PCA) has been widely used in monitoring industrial processes, but it is still necessary to make improvements in having a timely and effective access to variation information. It is known that the transformation matrix generated from real-time PCA model indicates inner relations between original variables and new produced components, so this matrix would be different when modeling data deviate due to the change of the operating condition. Based on this theory, this paper proposes a novel real-time monitoring approach which utilizes polygon area method to measure the variation degree of the transformation matrices and then constructs a statistic for monitoring purpose. The on-line data are collected through a combined moving window (CMW), containing both normal and monitored data. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, a simple numerical simulation, the CSTR process and the classic Tennessee Eastman process are employed for illustration, with some PCA-based methods used for comparison."

Conventional methods that use mathematical models have been found inaccurate because of the complexity of the industry machinery systems and the obvious existence of nonlinear factors such as noises. Therefore, any fault diagnosis issue can be treated as a pattern recognition problem. We present here an automatic fault diagnosis system of hand drills using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and pattern recognition techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The diagnosis system consists of three steps. Because of the presence of many noisy patterns in our signals, we first conduct a filtering analysis based on DWT. Second, the wavelet coefficients of the filtered signals are extracted as our features for the pattern recognition part. Third, PCA is performed over the wavelet coefficients in order to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors. Finally, the very first principal components are used as the inputs of an ANN based classifier to detect the wear on the drills. The results show that the proposed DWT-PCA-ANN method can be used for the sounds based automated diagnosis system."
comparison of data analysis procedures for real-time nanoparticle sampling data using classical regression and arima models,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Real-time monitoring is necessary for nanoparticle exposure assessment to characterize the exposure profile, but the data produced are autocorrelated. This study was conducted to compare three statistical methods used to analyze data, which constitute autocorrelated time series, and to investigate the effect of averaging time on the reduction of the autocorrelation using field data. First-order autoregressive (AR(1)) and autoregressive-integrated moving average (ARIMA) models are alternative methods that remove autocorrelation. The classical regression method was compared with AR(1) and ARIMA. Three data sets were used. Scanning mobility particle sizer data were used. We compared the results of regression, AR(1), and ARIMA with averaging times of 1, 5, and 10min. AR(1) and ARIMA models had similar capacities to adjust autocorrelation of real-time data. Because of the non-stationary of real-time monitoring data, the ARIMA was more appropriate. When using the AR(1), transformation into stationary data was necessary. There was no difference with a longer averaging time. This study suggests that the ARIMA model could be used to process real-time monitoring data especially for non-stationary data, and averaging time setting is flexible depending on the data interval required to capture the effects of processes for occupational and environmental nano measurements.</P>"

In this research, we have developed a voxel-based method to estimate the internal volume of a refrigerator automatically. It starts transforming all components facing the interior space into voxels and fills all holes and gaps automatically by the developed hole-filling algorithm to form a completely closed boundary of the assembly. Then, it identifies the boundary voxels that are facing to the internal voxels with any part of the component. After getting the intersection points between the boundary voxels and the surfaces of components, it generates the boundary surface of triangular facets with the intersection points. Finally, it estimates the internal volume by adding volume of each tetrahedron composed of a triangle of boundary surface and an arbitrary point."

Here Fe(OH)(2)(s) is investigated as a comprehensive solution for overcoming these challenges, by serving as both the reductant, (Fe(II)), and the immobilization agent to form Tc-incorporated magnetite (Fe3O4). Trace metal analysis suggests removal of Tc(VII) and Cr(VI) from solution occurs simultaneously; however, complete removal and reduction of Cr(VI) is achieved earlier than the removal/reduction of comingled Tc(VII). Bulk oxidation state analysis of the final magnetite solid phase by XANES shows that the majority of Tc is Tc(IV), which is corroborated by XPS measurements. Furthermore, EXAFS results show successful, albeit partial, Tc(IV) incorporation into magnetite octahedral sites. Cr XPS analysis indicates reduction to Cr(III) and the formation of a Cr-incorporated spinel, Cr2O3, and Cr(OH)(3) phases. Spinel (modeled as Fe3O4), goethite (alpha-FeOOH), and feroxyhyte (delta-FeOOH) are detected in all reacted final solid phase samples analyzed by XRD. Incorporation of Tc(IV) has little effect on the spinel lattice structure.

The learner-centered instructional model for communication education ultimately aims to achieve more effective student's teaching and learning goals in communication education of college. It is needed to enable students to actively and autonomously participate in class by seeking transformation of teaching method centered on student rather than teacher-centered. And it can solve the problem of motivation or interest of students. The modular instructional model for communication education allows students to design their own creative class plans and solve problems related to the diversity and efficiency of teaching methods. The teacher can provide the experience of designing the class by oneself as another space for communication education. And in this process, students can directly learn various thinking and conference process. In addition, students will be able to create more practical, creative, and reformative class. In the learner-centered modular instructional model for communication education, the role of the teacher is also important. First, the teacher should role as a guide to provide students with a educational model. Second, the teacher should role as an assistant to convey the necessary minimum theoretical knowledge to the students. Third, the teacher should assume the role of evaluator. It is pointed out that this study is one of the examples of the instructional model. But it is expected that this will be one of the factors that will help to turn the student's perception of communication education positively."

The spatio-temporal trend of air pollution exposure on two scenarios with flexible (FLX) and teleworking (TELE) policy in 2030 were then investigated by comparing to those on the base scenario (BAU). The experimental results indicate that while the amount of air pollution exposure in 2030 (on BAU) is typically larger than that in 2010, TELE scenario shows a decreasing pattern compared to that on the BAU. On the contrary, FLX implies its various trend, increasing and decreasing, in the morning and the afternoon, respectively. Lastly, the micro-scale study shows that there is no consistent trend of change in air pollution exposure due to individual daily reschedule response to their work location and time altered by FLX and TELE."

In the result of the empirical analysis, trust shows an inverted U-shaped relationship with IJV performance. Also, asset specificity shows the U-shaped relationship with IJV performance. The results suggest that it needs to control and maintain the trust level among the partners in order not to lose an appropriate control caused by too much trust. In order to minimize the cost generated by asset specificity and to transform it into positive impact, it needs a control and the operation of monitoring system on the opportunistic action of the partners. Furthermore, it needs to keep organizational flexibility and innovativeness to continuously develop new capabilities."

However, under the modern industrial environment, where technology is progressing gradually and cumulatively in various industrial fields, the utility model system needs to be transformed into a system for encouraging incremental technological innovation and technology diffusion rather than protecting the technologies of the less advanced ones. In order to find ways to revitalize the utility model system reflecting the characteristics of modern industrial society, in this article, I will try to suggest ways to improve the utility model system as a technical protection system that complements the patent system through comparative studies on the utility model law of Korea, China and Japan. Korea, China and Japan have adopted the utility model system, but the method of examination and the requirements for exercising the rights after registration are different, and there is a noticeable difference in their utilization rates. As of 2016, the proportion of utility model applications in the total number of patent and utility model applications is 52% in China, while the number of utility model applications is larger than that of patents. On the other hand, the rate of utility model applications in Korea is 4% and that of Japan is 2%. This may be interpreted as a result of differences in technology levels in each country, but institutional differences in each country have a greater impact on the difference in utilization rates. In this paper, I review the application trends of utility models and present implications through comparative analysis of utility model systems in Korea, China, and Japan. Next, I will suggest ways to improve the utility model law in Korea that reflects the industrial technology environment of modern society."

The proposed model is based on a probabilistic retail gravity model, and both the geographical characteristics and the potential customers’characteristics are also incorporated. Besides traditional components, such as the size of the facilities and the distance from the consumers to the facilities in the probabilistic retail gravity models, additive effects, clustering effects, and shopping center effects are considered as the geographical characteristics, and brand preference is considered as potential customers’characteristics. Such new factors enhance accuracy of the model that reflects the probability of consumers travelling from home to facilities. Ultimately, in order to estimate the sales of a facility, the ratio of one-person homes and the income level in each potential region are utilized. This study is meaningful in the fact that it is the only study to estimate sales in the domestic home-furnishing market, even though the market is restricted by furniture-based brands.

Prior to its actual use, electric power flows through several transformations by voltage transformers in substationsdepending on the characteristics of each usage, and a transformer has the structure consisting of the main body, winding wire,insulating oil and bushings. A transformer fire that breaks out in substations entails the primary damage that interrupts thepower supply to houses and commercial facilities and causes various safety accidents as well as the secondary economic losses.It is considered that causes of such fire include the leak of insulating oil resulting from the destruction of bottom part ofbushings, and the chain reaction of fire due to insulating oil that reaches its ignition point within 1 second. The smoke detectorand automatic fire extinguishing system are established in order to minimize fire damage, but a difficulty in securing goldentime for extinguishing fire due to delay in the operation of detector and release of gas from the extinguishing system hasbecome a problem. Accordingly, this study was carried out according to needs of active mechanism to prevent the spread offire and block the leak of insulating oil, in accordance with the importance of securing golden time in extinguishing a firein its early stage. A bushings fireproof structure was developed by applying the high temperature shape retention materials,which are expanded by flame, and mechanical flame cutoff devices. The bushings fireproof structure was installed on thetransformer model produced by applying the actual standards of bushings and flange, and the full scale fire test was carriedout. It was confirmed that the bushings fireproof structure operated at accurate position and height within 3 seconds from theflame initiation.

In addition, the paper analyzes the gravity model with product-level heterogeneity which originates from centrality measure in product space and examines how much the centrality measure explains the export structure of Korea, China and Japan. Empirical results show that over 30% of products in product space have significantly changed their centrality in the past 24 years. Also, the empirical results based on the gravity model in product space illustrates that the estimated elasticity of centrality measure, the major concept of product space, is significantly positive in all of the model specifications as theoretically expected and plays an important role in determining trade flows in global market and the export structure in the country level. These evidence illustrates that Korea has successfully achieved the structural transformation in manufacturing industries more timely than China and Japan as the global trend of export sophistication in product space has changed. Also, with these results, we carefully predict that the structural transformation in product space play a key role in economic growth of the manufacturing countries."

The analysis index utilized the factors suggested by Lee Jae Moo(2014), which effectively improved the policy narrative model used to grasp policy discourse patterns in Korea. As a result of the analysis, it was revealed that the intention of the coalition supporting the policy was mainly reflected in the policy regardless of the type and the nature of the regulatory policy, and public opinion also supported the policy belief and the discourse strategy of the supporting coalition.In addition, in the discourses identified in the process of regulatory policy formation, it is also confirmed that the coalition supporting the policy mainly adopts the identity strategy of the loser who defines themselves as the social victim, and the group that opposes it adopts the winner's identity strategy. In addition, both the policy - driven and the opposing groups in the process of discourse prefer a strategy that emphasizes social costs in terms of costs and benefits, but it was judged to be more effective when social benefits are emphasized. Based on the results of this analysis, the public interest should be considered a top priority in the process of forming regulatory policy in the future, and policy implications for enhancing fact - based strategies in policy discourse are suggested."

The next generation is the hope of future church, but it is a reality that it is urgent to provide treatment through counseling as many young people nowadays show the pathological symptoms such as suicide, depression, violence, obesity, and disconnection of relationship, etc. The researcher sought to find the root cause of adolescent pathological symptoms in ‘loneliness’. The condition of loneliness comes from the disconnection of the relationship between God and man, resulting in a variety of pathological symptoms.  The reasons for the disconnection of human relationship with God were presented through a case study as follows. First, the next generation has different cultural characteristics unlike the current generation, for example, preferring anonymity, and communicating in virtual space, second, the wounds from the relationship with the original family (marital conflict, parental divorce, disconnection of conversation), and third, undifferentiated faith. As the existing Jubak Stay has a name of ‘spending the night with the Lord’, an evaluative analysis and a biblical model (Matthew 15: 29-31) was provided for a healing function. As an alternative, Jubak Stay aims to overcome the problem of loneliness which is the cause of the next generation’s pathological symptoms by installing the following functions. First, participants taking part in Jubak Stay have a positive stroke and have a positive self-esteem for themselves and others. Second, it is possible to confirm the love between parents and children through new reflection on their family relations. Third, it is possible to have the opportunity to change from undifferentiated life to individualistic-reflexive faith."
산업민주화의 한 모형-프랑스 근로자 생산협동기업(scop)에 관한 고찰,2017,"['산업민주주의', '근로자 생산협동기업(SCOP)', 'Industrial Democracy', 'Cooperative Enterprise of Workers(SCOP)']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"SCOP(Societe Cooperative Ouvriere de Production), an organizational form of the cooperative enterprise of workers, has contributed significantly to the national economy of France where a variety of political ideologies and systems coexisted. As of 2015, there are 51,500 employees in 2,855 SCOPs, which made a great contribution to job creation and industrial democracy.The SCOPs in France are mainly divided into three types. The first is Ex-nihilo type, in which workers establish production cooperatives by themselves and operate independently. The second is Transformation type where small- and medium- sized manufacturers are acquired by employees and managed independently. The third is Reanimation type in which employees operate and manage companies acquired through bankruptcy buyout. Some SCOPs temporarily exist and disappear due to internal conflicts and limitations, but the number of SCOPs has been steadily increasing. In average, 100 to 150 SCOPs are increasing every year.It is also noteworthy that the steadily increasing social cooperative, SCIC(Societe Cooperative d`Interet Collectif), has been included in the SCOP analysis since 2012.This study aims to explore the history and developmental process of SCOP as well as to examine its operating systems, principles and socio-economic performance. SCOP has been considered as a model of industrial democracy. The investigation of SCOP can provide useful implications for establishment and operations for employee buyouts and social cooperatives in Korea.The SCOPs in France have gone through many trials and errors in the past 170 years and created their own “uniqueness” and “competitiveness(core competence)”. As such, SCOPs have contributed a great deal to socio-economic performance such as improving quality of work life, respect for humanity and the realization of industrial democracy.In the 1970s, Korea achieved a remarkable economic growth along with various attempts at social reforms. This periods of time is called “Economic Revolution” or “Transitional Periods”. In the process, however, qualitative aspects such as solidarity and equality between labor and management, democratic operation of organizations, and overcoming labor marginality through participation have been neglected. Korean government has focused only on quantitative performance in the process.As can be seen from the quantitative data, the number of SCOPs in the CGSCOP has been steadily increasing. In the meantime, some SCOPs exist only for a short period of time due to their internal conflicts and limitations. Nevertheless, average of 100 to 150 SCOPs are increasing per year. As may be seen from this figure, voluntary participation of employees and their challenging spirits could contribute significantly to the creation and maintenance of employment as well as to the realization of industrial democracy.Therefore, investigation of SCOPs in France could help search for alternatives in more proactive establishment of industrial democracy in Korea. It is expected that more broad range of data collection, literature and case studies may trigger more systematic analysis and studies on SCOP systems in France."

However, the exchange rate effect on China’s balance of trade is still limited."

To solve these problems, this paper presents a method for parameter extractions and circuit modeling of a practical transformer. The equivalent model of a practical transformer by the suggested method consists of an ideal transformer model, two resistors, two leakage inductors, and a mutual inductor. The parameters for a practical transformer is extracted by open and short circuit analysis methods, and the electric model of an ideal transformer is made by solving the requirements. To verify the effectiveness of the equivalent model of a practical transformer, a test bed with two winding transformer is built.

Lastly, we analyzed multiple-period model of cost behavior to investigate manger’s long-term decision. Empirical estimates indicated that asymmetric cost behavior reflected deliberate resource commitment by manager’s long-term decisions expect for sales decrease three years in a row. Also it is interpretable that averagely sticky cost behavior is the results of both prior sales increase regardless of sales fluctuation in previous year ago and the coefficient estimates of labor costs, and other SG&A costs.This paper contributes to the accounting research by investigating the cost behavior using various empirical models.

And building a representation in the connectionist model study is just as important as making the structure of the model in that it determines the level of learning and performance of the model. The connectionist model has been constructed in two different ways: localist representation and distributed representation. However, the localist representation used in the previous studies had limitations in that the unit of the output layer having a rare target activation value is inactivated, and the past distributed representation has the limitation of difficulty in confirming the result by the opacity of the displayed information. This has been a limitation of the overall connection model study. In this paper, we present a new method to induce distributed representation with local representation using abstraction of information, which is a feature of restricted Boltzmann machine, with respect to the limitation of such representation of the past.

Activation policy, based on Adult Worker model, which has entailed reforms to classical social assistance, setting out eradication of single mother’s welfare dependence and their economic sufficiency as explicit objective. This is a part of welfare reforms for transforming classic welfare state and male breadwinner/female carer model which has pursued de-commodification to their own labour power through defining woman as carer. This approach for activating those on welfare, based on Supply Side Economics and New Public Management, has defined women as laborer in the entitlements to social assistance provisions and actively utilizes compulsion and economic incentive for reinforcing their participation and responsibilities to paid work. From women’s right to form independent household without the risk of poverty and the viewpoint of unpaid care, This policy packages is why it implies transform to women’s social citizenship.  The framework for analyzing this is set up in three dimension, such as ‘welfare conditionality’ to impose work-related requirements, ‘work incentive’for financial awards, and ‘work-first’ orienting rapid entry into labor market. The analysis countries are ten of OECD member including South Korea. As a result, It suggested that South Korea is close to ‘male-breadwinner/female-carer model’ because of the lowest level of activating those on welfare. But this model was assessed ‘residual’ in that National Basic Livelihood Security System, Social Assistance in korea, has been nested elements of ‘private patriarchy’, such as provisions concerning parents obligation to support their daughter who is single mother, and financial responsibility of father to those caring his biological children.

The purpose of this paper is to grasp the types of leadership acknowledged by the industry of manufacturing, construction, and service, and also to empirically analyze the organizational effectiveness of the leadership. The study measures the organizational effectiveness in terms of the job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and organizational citizenship behavior while classifying the leadership into coaching leadership, transformational leadership, and sensible leadership. In addition, the strictness of the analysis is imposed by estimating the simple least square model and ranking probit model. The results of the least square model is summarized as the following. Regardless of the different defining terms of organizational effectiveness, transformational leadership was shown to have the greatest organizational effectiveness. Sensible leadership positively effected job satisfaction whereas coaching leadership positively effected job satisfaction and organizational effectiveness. Compared to transformational leadership and coaching leadership, the impact of the sensible leadership was very much limited. The result of the ranking probit model is summarized as the following. First, sensible leadership had a positive impact on the member’s job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Second, regarding the organizational citizenship behavior, coaching leadership showed greater impact than transformational leadership. This results contradicts the results from the simple least square model. If similar studies were to be conducted in the future, two models and the results must be compared. Third, as the leadership score increases by 1 point, there is greater possibility of having more than 4 points for all job satisfaction, organizational commitment, organizational citizenship behavior.

Accordingly, one doesn`t have to learn new GPGPU programming languages such as CUDA or OpenCL to use GPU. An OpenACC program allocates GPU memory, transfers data between the host CPU and GPU devices and performs GPU operations automatically or following user-defined directives. We compared performance of 3D wave propagation modeling programs using OpenACC and GPU to that using single-core CPU through numerical tests. Results using a homogeneous model and the SEG/EAGE salt model show that the OpenACC programs are approximately 53 and 30 times faster than those using single-core CPU."

In this study, TV drama “Descendants of the Sun” which gained tremendous popularity at home and abroad was considered to be an example of the heroic narrative model proposed by Vogler. Further, two analysis points were identified as the critical factor of success: modern transformation and global transformation. Modern transformation is about distinct characteristics of Korea, found in three primary factors of the work: the setting up of a character, the development of events and the background set-up. Global transformation features universal value to attract foreign viewers by lowering cultural discount. In “Descendants of the Sun”, humanism is considered to broaden the horizon of the work by affecting above three factors. In conclusion, It is the proper combination of these dual transformations that globalize Korean drama. In this regard, this study will be a meaningful attempt to shed light on the storytelling strategy of Korean dramas in terms of the heroic narrative."

Firstly we construct a “complex system model” to analyze the Swedish design. “Complex system model for analysis of Swedish design” is largely divided into 1) natural systems related to geography, climate, weather, etc, 2) societal systems related to political system, economic system, social policy etc, and 3) cultural systems on philosophy, ideology, value, etc. Swedish design can be interpreted as having been developed as a result of multiple interaction among compositions of such a model. Secondly we divide the history of Swedish design into two period, that is, before 1970s and after 1970s. The main idea that appeared in the former Swedish design is ‘modern’ functionalism and humanism, and in the latter Swedish design is ‘postmodern’ change and diversity. We examine the change of ideas from the former to the latter. In design field, so-called ‘Swedish design’, the design of Sweden has been regarded as having uniqueness and originality. These estimations can be interpreted as accepting modern functionalism that was popular in Europe in the early 20th century, based on the transformation based on Swedish ‘craft-tradition’ and ‘craftsmanship’. However, ‘Modern Functionalism and Humanism’, which was promoted in Swedish design, is also under the influence of post modernism in the 1970s. If you look at the future of Swedish design, keep the basic framework of Swedish ‘functionalism of modernism and humanism’. It is expected that they will seriously consider the problem of how to harmonize with the trend of ‘post-modern various ideological change’. In short, how to flexibly combine the ‘stability’ and ‘evolution’ path of traditional Swedish design, It is a question of whether to be able to make the title of “Swedish design” as a global brand and maintain the title befitting its reputation."

We derive the queue-length distributions in the M/G/1 queueing model with two classes of customers, under the (N, n)-preemptive repeat-different priority discipline. In order to derive the queue-length distributions, we employ an analysis of the effective service time of a low-priority customer, a delay cycle analysis, and a joint transformation method. We then derive the first and second moments of the queue lengths of high- and low-priority customers. We also present a numerical example for the first and second moments of the queue length of high- and low-priority customers. Through doing this, we show that, under the (N, n)-preemptive repeat-different priority discipline, the first and secondmoments of customers with high priority are bounded by some upper bounds, regardless of the service characteristics of customers with low priority. This property may help system engineers design such service systems that guarantee the mean and variance of delay for primary users under a certain bounds, when preempted services have to be restarted with another service time resampled from the same service time distribution."

According to one estimation [1], there will be 20 million EV fleets on the road by 2020 and that the aggregated sale of EVs will rise to 5.9 million. Integration of large number of EVs to the distribution network will pose serious threats in terms of the reliability and stability of the power system. In order to mitigate the adverse effects on the power system, this paper proposes an approach for the management of EV charging along with smart home load management (SHLM) systems by using a water-filling (WF) algorithm. The proposed framework ensures that the instantaneous load at a distribution transformer is restrained below its rated capacity while consumer preferences are taken into account. In the case that the instantaneous demand increases beyond the transformer capacity, the proposed framework allocates a demand restraining limit (DRL) to each home associated with the transformer. The allocation of the DRL is dynamic and based on the consideration of the convenience factor, demand profile and characteristics of the flexible appliances of all the consumers. The performance of the proposed plan is verified by considering a network consisting of a distribution transformer and five homes."

The main objective herein is to systematically establish the relationship between two independent theories (i.e., third order zigzag model and conventional FSDT) in the Laplace domain via the strain energy transformation. For viscoelastic problems, the complexity of dealing with viscoelastic materials can be simplified by introducing the concept of Laplace transform. Based on the predefined relationship, the proposed finite element model has the same computational advantage as that of the conventional FSDT (5-DOFs), while allowing the improved local layer-wise distributions of viscoelastic responses via the recovery procedure. In the model, a simple eight-noded isoparametric plate element is employed to analyze the viscoelastic response of multilayered composite and sandwich plates. Furthermore, for the isotropic material, a reference solution based on the three-dimensional finite element model is newly introduced to evaluate the accuracy of the viscoelastic behavior. To demonstrate the perforance of the proposed finite element model, the results obtained are compared to those of the conventional FSDT and three-dimensional finite elements with commercial software (i.e., ABAQUS).</P>"
estimation of fixity factors of bolted joints in a steel frame structure using a vibration-based health monitoring technique,2017,"['frame structure', 'loosening of bolts', 'fixity factor', 'frequency shape correlation', 'model updating']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Framed steel structures frequently have bolted connections to ensure semi-rigid joints that have a significant amount of energy dissipation incorporated in them, to avoid failure of connections and members under cyclic loading, such as wind and earthquake loading. One problem is that due to cyclic action, these bolts may loosen, and compromise subsequent behavior of the structure. A vibration-based health monitoring technique for quantification of the level of loosening of bolted joints in a steel plane frame structure is presented here, to provide a basis for evaluation of the structure state. A numerical model of a plane frame is considered with rotational springs representing semi-rigid joints. A fixity factor is defined in terms of rotational spring stiffness and is considered as a measure of level of loosening of bolts with zero representing fully loose and one representing fully tight condition. Experimental strain time histories are collected and transformed into frequency domain using Fourier transform. A shape co-relation is defined using frequency data obtained from the damaged and the undamaged structures. Using the frequency spectra and shape correlation, an objective function (OF) is developed and minimized by the particle swarm optimization to estimate the fixity factor. It is found that the technique estimates higher value of reduction of the fixity factor in the damaged location, but shows some considerable value at the other springs also. Therefore, the technique is improved using heuristics by identifying probable damage locations prior to applying model updation, in order to estimate the damage severity more accurately. Considering fixity factors at the identified locations as variables, model updating is done for estimation of fixity factors. The improved results clearly indicate actual damage locations and fixity factors for different levels of bolt loosening, and is found satisfactory for possible future application of the technique to multistory framed structures."

The driving data are collected by using the three-dimensional driving simulator based on CAVE Automatic Virtual Environment(CAVE), which provides stereoscope immersive virtual environment. In our modeling, the control scenario of the human driver, that is, the mapping from the driver’s sensory information to the operation of the driver such as acceleration, braking and steering, is expressed by Piecewise Polynomial System (PWPS) model. Since the PWPS model includes both continuous behavior given by polynomials and discrete logical conditions, it can be regarded as a class of Hybrid Dynamical System(HDS). The key idea to solve the identification problem for the PWPS model is formulated as the Mixed Integer Linear Programming(MILP) by transforming the switching conditions into binary variables. From the obtained results, it is found that the driver appropriately switches the ‘control law’ according to the following scenario : At the beginning of the stopping maneuver (just after finding the stopping point), the driver decelerate the vehicle based on the acceleration information, and then switch th toe control law based on the distance to the stop line. These results enable us to capture not only the physical meaning of the driving skill(polynomials), but also the decision-making aspect(switching conditions) in the driver’s stopping maneuver."
a dct-based total jnd profile for spatiotemporal and foveated masking effects,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>In image and video processing fields, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)-based just-noticeable difference (JND) profiles have effectively been utilized to remove perceptual redundancies in pictures for compression. In this paper, we solve two problems that are often intrinsic to the conventional DCT-based JND profiles: 1) no foveated masking (FM) JND model has been incorporated in modeling the DCT-based JND profiles and 2) the conventional temporal masking (TM) JND models assume that all moving objects in frames can be well tracked by the eyes and that they are projected on the fovea regions of the eyes, which is not a realistic assumption and may result in poor estimation of JND values for untracked moving objects (or image regions). To solve these two problems, we first propose a generalized JND model for joint effects between TM and FM effects. With this model, called the temporal-foveated masking (TFM) JND model, JND thresholds for any tracked/untracked and moving/still image regions can be elaborately estimated. Finally, the TFM-JND model is incorporated into a total DCT-based JND profile with a spatial contrast sensitivity function, luminance masking, and contrast masking JND models. In addition, we propose a JND adjustment method for our total JND profile to avoid overestimation of JND values for image blocks of fixed sizes with various image characteristics. To validate the effectiveness of the total JND profile, an experiment involving a subjective distortion-visibility assessment has been conducted. The experiment results show that the proposed total DCT-based JND profile yields significant performance improvement with much higher capability of distortion concealment (average 5.6-dB lower PSNR) compared with state-of-the-art JND profiles.

The eddy current loss of the structure is calculated by an electromagnetic field FEM program and the results are compared with 4 different shapes of tie-plates. Since the thickness of the tie-plate is very thin, and the skin depth is very small, the number of FE elements for 3-D transformer model is too big to solve. So, the surface impedance boundary condition (SIBC) is used to reduce the system matrix size and its computing time. To verify the method a 2.5 MVA 22,900/380V distribution transformer is simulated using one objective function and three design variables with some constraints. The final optimized tie-plate has three slots of 6 ㎜ width and 23 ㎜ gap, and the loss is reduced by 75 %. Consequently, the proposed algorithm seems to be considerably applicable to electric machinery as well as power transformer."

prediction of hardness and deformation using a 3-d thermal analysis in laser hardening of aisi h13 tool steel,2017,"['Laser hardening', 'Thermal analysis', 'Carbon diffusion time', 'Cooling time', 'Hardness prediction', 'Deformation prediction']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>In this study, a 3-D thermal analysis assisted by a systematic experimental study using a 2kW multi-mode fiber laser was employed to develop predictive models for hardness and thermal deformation in laser transformation hardening of AISI H13 tool steel. Using the thermal model, temperature histories were obtained, which then were processed to compute the effective carbon diffusion time (ECDT) and the effective cooling time (ECT), the two concepts recently proposed by Ki and So [1]. Carefully observing the extensive hardness and deformation measurement data, it was revealed that ECDT is a parameter that correlates well with hardness, and ECT, when extended to the plastic deformation region, shows a strong correlation with deflection angle for both plastic deformation and solid-state phase transformation regions. By finding the minimum specimen thickness that preserves the hardening characteristics of thick steel plates, we were able to increase the deflection angle to∼0.8°, and, after laser hardening, hardness values of up to∼800Hv were obtained. In this study, ECDT and ECT maps for AISI H13 tool steel were computed along with the hardening process window (or heat treatable region), and using the thermal model and experimental data, the minimum specimen thickness that preserves the hardening characteristics of thick plates was determined.

robust fault diagnosis scheme in a class of nonlinear system based on uio and fuzzy residual,2017,"['At least four key words or phrases in alphabetical order', 'separated by commas']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In this study, a novel robust fault diagnosis scheme is developed for a class of nonlinear systems whenboth fault and disturbance are considered. The proposed scheme includes both component and sensor fault withnonlinear system that transferred to nonlinear Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) model. It considers a larger category of nonlinearsystem when fuzzification is used for only nonlinear distribution matrices. In fact the proposed method coversnonlinear systems could not transform to linear T-S model. This paper studies the problem of robust fault diagnosisbased on two fuzzy nonlinear observers, the first one is a fuzzy nonlinear unknown input observer (FNUIO) andthe other is a fuzzy nonlinear Luenberger observer (FNLO). This approach decouples the faulty subsystem fromthe rest of the system through a series of transformations. Then, the objective is to design FNUIO to guaranteethe asymptotic stability of the error dynamic using the Lyapunov method; meanwhile, FNLO is designed for faultysubsystem to generate fuzzy residual signal based on a quadratic Lyapunov function and some matrices inequalityconvexification techniques. FNUIO affects only the fault free subsystem and completely removes any unknown inputssuch as disturbances when residual signal is generated by FNLO is affected by component or sensor fault. Thisnovelty and using nonlinear system in T-S model make the proposed method extremely effective from last decadeliterature. Sufficient conditions are established in order to guarantee the convergence of the state estimation error.Thus, a residual generator is determined on the basis of LMI conditions such that the estimation error is completelysensitive to fault vector and insensitive to the unknown inputs. Finally, an numerical example is given to show thehighly effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis scheme."

exploring spatial patterns of theft crimes using geographically weighted regression,2017,"['Theft Crime', 'Spatial Pattern', 'Ordinary Least Squares', 'Geographically Weighted Regression']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The goal of this study was to efficiently analyze the relationships of the number of thefts with related factors, considering the spatial patterns of theft crimes. Theft crime data for a 5-year period (2009–2013) were collected from Haeundae Police Station. A logarithmic transformation was performed to ensure an effective statistical analysis and the number of theft crimes was used as the dependent variable. Related factors were selected through a literature review and divided into social, environmental, and defensive factors. Seven factors, were selected as independent variables: the numbers of foreigners, aged persons, single households, companies, entertainment venues, community security centers, and CCTV (Closed-Circuit Television) systems. OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) and GWR (Geographically Weighted Regression) were used to analyze the relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables. In the GWR results, each independent variable had regression coefficients that differed by location over the study area. The GWR model calculated local values for, and could explain the relationships between, variables more efficiently than the OLS model. Additionally, the adjusted R square value of the GWR model was 10% higher than that of the OLS model, and the GWR model produced a AICc (Corrected Akaike Information Criterion) value that was lower by 230, as well as lower Moran’s I values. From these results, it was concluded that the GWR model was more robust in explaining the relationship between the number of thefts and the factors related to theft crime."

한국과 일본 화학산업에서 사업 포트폴리오와 r&d가 경영성과에 미치는 영향,2017,"['value strategy', 'segment portfolio', 'R&D', 'chemical industry', 'cluster analysis']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The Korean chemical industry has been one of the heavy industrial sectors to boost Korean economy during the past three decades. In the early 2010s, the Korean chemical firms faced significant challenges due to global overcapacity and rising competition from China and Middle East countries. The current downturn of Korean chemical industry comes from internal factors on strategic choice, not from global business cycle. In September of 2016, Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy recommended the necessity of cutting the production of four items - Terephthalic acid(TPA), polystyrene(PS), synthetic rubber(SBR) and PVC. Meanwhile, in 1959, Japan, known as the Triad with the US and Western Europe controlled the global chemical industry. However, by the 1990s, with the emergence and growth of companies based in Korea, Taiwan and China, Japan struggled through a lost decade that continued into the 2000s. Although Japanese chemical companies have lagged behind companies in the West in adjusting to new business realities, many companies have already taken significant steps to increase their competitive advantage through restructuring, consolidation and new research. Industry level change inevitably requires a company to fundamentally rethink its strategy and business model.What is the value strategy for the Korean chemical firms to sustain their competitive advantages under uncertainty associated with a strategic infection point (SIP)? A SIP is a critical period during which major threats as well as new opportunities come about. This paper addresses this key question by examining the following issues. Firstly, our study diagnoses whether the current chemical industry in Korea and Japan confronts a SIP on the basis of adapted seven forces model consisting of market forces - the five forces framework of traditional industry analysis and complementors - as well as nonmarket forces associated with technology and government regulation. Secondly, we examine the different adaptation strategies between the most profitable and non-profitable chemical companies in Korea and Japan in light of segment portfolio and R&D using case studies. Lastly, we conduct an empirical study to classify Korean and Japanese chemical companies into three groups by application of cluster analysis. Segment portfolio and R&D are of interest as independent variables because they have been linked to value creation, whereas operating income, as a dependent variable is an external signal to indicate each firm`s financial performance. The data set used in descriptive statistics and cluster analysis comes from DART (Data Analysis, Retrieval and Transfer System) and annual reports of 44 Korean and Japanese chemical firms from 2000 to 2016. Our results show that there exists a significant gap of operating income among three groups, i.e. a high performance group makes known by diversifying segment portfolio into high value-added specialty materials with strong R&D capability. This group consists of most Japanese firms specialized in chemical materials. However, no Korean firm was found there. Our findings suggest that Korean chemical firms are called for in the process of strategic transformation to improve portfolio with value-added specialty by enhancing in-house R&D capability and acquiring specialty business. In order to step out of the pending crisis, Korean chemical companies should shift their growth strategy paradigm in the global market. A SIP signals the timing to change. Transformation involves rapidly and radically changing each firm`s strategy. A key task of top management is to recognize ambiguous and conflicting signals of a SIP, adapt to a new business model and develop new value strategy. Their new resolve must be followed by changes in resource allocation. It is expected that this study can be applied to other heavy industries, e.g. shipbuilding, automobile and steel that underpinned Korea`s past growth."

some remarks on rapid calculation of gravity anomalies,2017,"['gravity modeling', 'Fourier transforms', 'spectral method']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"We examine the validity and limitation of the spectral method widely used for computing gravity anomalies by comparing the predicted results with the analytic solutions of the given simple bodies. The gravity anomalies owing to simple synthetic data, such as a wall and cone, are estimated from both the spectral method and analytic solution. The discrepancies between these calculated results indicate that the validity of the estimated gravity anomalies is sensitive to both the size of the data domain and the shape of the feature. In particular, the spectral method shows a limitation to separate spiky bathymetric features into several sinusoidal functions. Choosing the mean depth for the spectral method can be another important factor to make predictions comparable with the observed data. The shortcomings of the spectral method characterized from synthetic cases are found in a real example case. The shipboard bathymetry from the Gloria 5, 6, and 7 expeditions is used for estimating the gravity anomalies owing to topographic undulations. We suggest that the application of the rapid calculation of gravity anomalies can be most productive with a sufficient investigation of the data quality and domain, and geologic constraints for validating the results of the Fourier transforms."
different allometric intercepts in major aegus chelifer chelifer stag beetle males from urban and forest habitats,2017,['Population Piecewise model Mandible'],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Many insects, including stag beetles, possess exaggerated structures and these structures usually grow disproportionately with their body size. Allometry, i.e. the scaling relationship between such traits and other body parts (used as proxies of body size in a species), can provide valuable information about development and evolution. We examined males of Aegus chelifer chelifer, a stag beetle from forest and urban habitats in Thailand to clarify the allometric relationship between weapon (mandible) and body (elytra) size. The relationship between the log-transformed mandible and elytra length was non-linear and best fitted the piecewise linear model.Moreover, this model revealed the existence of dimorphism in males that could be divided into minor and major morphs based on their mandible size, in broad agreement with the morph classification based on mandible shape. Both morphs from the two populations (urban and forest) exhibited positive allometry, and the allometric slope declined in the major morph. Comparison between populations showed the allometric slopes were similar, but the intercepts were significantly different in the major morphs. The genetic or environmental basis should be further explored for the two morphs as well as any behavioural variation."

In the wake of this new concept, a new science-based TCM formula that counteracts various syndromes is needed. The objective of this study was to develop such a formula. Five of the most clinically prescribed TCM herbs that work on different syndromes, namely Gastrodia elata, Uncaria rhynchophylla, Pueraria thomsonii, Panax notoginseng, and Alisma orientale, were selected for this study. The fingerprints of these five herbs were analyzed by tri-step Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Three different solvents, 95% ethanol, 50% ethanol, and distilled water, were used for the maceration of the herbs and their vasodilatory effects were studied using in vitro precontracted aortic ring model. Among these, the 50% ethanolic extracts of G. elata (GE50) and A. orientale (AO50), and 95% ethanolic extracts of U. rhynchophylla (UR95), P. thomsonii (PT95), and P. notoginseng (PN95) were found to be the most effective for eliciting vasodilation. Thus, these five extracts were used for orthogonal stimulus–response compatibility group studies by using L25 (55) formula. The best combination ratio for GE50, UR95, PT95, PN95, and AO50, which was assigned as Formula 1 (F1), was found at EC0, EC25, EC20, EC20, and EC10, respectively. The vasodilatory effect of the extracts prepared from different extraction methods using F1 ratio was also studied. From the results, the EC50 and Rmax of total 50% ethanolic extract of five herbs using F1 ratio (F1-2) were 0.028 ± 0.005 mg/mL and 101.71% ± 3.64%, with better values than F1 (0.104 ± 0.014 mg/mL and 97.80% ± 3.12%, respectively). In conclusion, the optimum ratio and appropriate extraction method (F1-2) for the new TCM formula were revealed."

Heavy metal sorption was highly pH dependent with maximum Cr6+ and As3+ sorption occurring at pH 2.0 and pH 8.0, respectively. Kinetic data showed that sorption occurred rapidly during the first 120min, with most metal ions being bound to HF biomass within 360 min. A higher correlation coefficient (r2 > 0.945) indicated that adsorption data are best fitted to both the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models. The Cr6+ (As3+) of the Freundlich constants, KF and 1/n, were 4.900 L/g (0.834 L/g) and 0.385 L/g (0.598 L/g), respectively, for HF biomass. The Cr6+ (As3+) of the Langmuir constants, Qm and b, were 10.295 mg/g (43.565mg/g) and 27.767 L/mg (17.425 L/mg), respectively, for HF biomass. Fourier transform infrared analysis (FTIR) revealed interactions among amino, carboxyl, sulfonate, and hydroxyl groups during Cr6+ and As3+ binding to HF biomass. This study shows that HF biomass has potential application as a sorbent for the removal of anion heavy metals from residual waters."

The most important characteristic of this phase of globalization is the rise of cross border flows of trade, investment, finance and technological knowledge. The rising investment in technological knowledge drives increasingly the long term growth process of the developing economies. It is increasingly realized that the level of trade and FDI across borders effects the knowledge generation and dissemination across countries. In this study an attempt is made to examine the relationship between economic growth measured through total factor productivity and knowledge economy variables such as domestic and foreign R&D covering the period of 2001-2012 across 19 developing countries. The regression analysis used in this study is based on panel data analysis using fixed effects models. The results of the study reveals that domestic knowledge stock, openness and the interaction terms of foreign R&D spillovers with openness, human capital and FDI have shown positive impact on total factor productivity of selected 19 developing economies. Further, the impact of foreign knowledge spillovers channeled through the imports of total goods and services are found to be positive and significant while it has been found negative in case of capital goods. An important policy implication that results from this analysis is that the higher level of human capital and international trade results into higher level of productivity growth via knowledge spillovers."
effect of relaxin expressing adenovirus on scar remodeling: a preliminary study,2017,"['Gene therapy', 'Cicatrix', 'Relaxin', 'Adenovirus']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Background: Relaxin is a transforming growth factor β1 antagonist. To determine the effects of relaxin on scar reduction, we investigated the scar remodeling process by injecting relaxin-expressing adenoviruses using a pig scar model.Methods: Scars with full thickness were generated on the backs of Yorkshire pigs. Scars were divided into two groups (relaxin [RLX] and Control). Adenoviruses were injected into the RLX (expressing relaxin) and Control (not expressing relaxin) groups. Changes in the surface areas, color index and pliability of scars were compared.Results: Fifty days after treatment, the surface areas of scars decreased, the color of scars was normalized, and the pliability of scars increased in RLX group.Conclusion: Relaxin-expressing adenoviruses improved the surface area, color, and pliability of scars. The mechanism of therapeutic effects on scar formation should be further investigated."

The proposed algorithm leads to high accuracy at minimum cost to predict fault location and fault type classification. This algorithm requires impedance measurement data from one end of the transmission line. Modal decomposition is used to extract positive sequence impedance. Then, the fault signal is decomposed by using discrete wavelet transform. Statistical sampling is used to extract appropriate fault features as benchmark of decomposed signal to train classifier. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to illustrate the performance of statistical sampling performance. The overall time of sampling is not exceeding 1¼ cycles, taking into account the interval time. The proposed method takes two steps of sampling. The first step takes ¾ cycle of during-fault and the second step takes ¼ cycle of post fault impedance. The interval time between the two steps is assumed to be ¼ cycle. Extensive studies using MATLAB software show accurate fault location estimation and fault type classification of the proposed method. The classifier result is presented and compared with well-established travelling wave methods and the performance of the algorithms are analyzed and discussed."

To investigate the plume migration of land-derived contaminants within a tidally influenced aquifer, both spatially and temporally varying expressions of the Darcy velocity and dispersion coefficients obtained from the analytical solution of the groundwater head response, which were subject to sinusoidal boundary conditions due to tidal fluctuation, were considered. This new semi-analytical solution was verified against a numerical solution, as well as the peak location trajectory obtained using the Predictor-Corrector method. Sensitivity analyses of tidal amplitude, hydraulic conductivity, and storage coefficient using the proposed solution were performed to understand plume behavior with regard to plume shape, plume spatial moments, and macrodispersion coefficients to gain a better understanding of the transport mechanisms. As the tidal amplitude, hydraulic conductivity, and storage coefficient were increased, the peaks were travelled faster, and peak concentrations were decreased. In addition, an increase in tidal amplitude, hydraulic conductivity, and storage coefficient caused an increase in variance as well as the macrodispersion coefficient. It was observed that negative macrodispersion appeared when the storage coefficient was largest, as well as when the difference between landward-directed advective velocity at the leading and trailing edges of the plume was greatest.

In this study, we aimed to ascertain the turnover between membrane and neutral lipids via <I>BTA1</I> knockdown transformants. Transgenic lines CrBta-hm13 and CrBta-hm31 were 80% and 60% downregulated in <I>BTA1</I> gene expression levels, respectively. Both transformants had half the amount of DGTS, which coincided with decreased monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), which was increased approximately threefold in neutral lipids. While the reduction of DGTS was shown to arise from inhibition of DGTS synthesis, decreased MGDG was affected by internal stress, such as ER stress, which was induced to have a decreased amount of DGTS in the ER. However, galactolipids, except for MGDG, and phospholipids in the transformants were maintained at similar levels. In the transformants, the molar proportion of C16:4 and C18:3(9,12,15), which are the major fatty acids of MGDG, was significantly increased in triacylglycerol (TAG) because of MGDG degradation. Thus, lipid turnover arising from the downregulation of DGTS and induction of ER stress caused a decrease in DGTS and MGDG, which generated a synergy effect on the accumulation of TAG.

Adiponectin, an adipocyte-derived cytokine, has many beneficial effects on metabolic disorders such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. C1q/TNF-Related Protein 9 (CTRP9), the closest paralog of adiponectin, has been reported to have beneficial effects on wound healing. In the current study, we demonstrate that CTRP9 regulates growth, differentiation, and apoptosis of HaCaT human keratinocytes. We found that CTRP9 augmented expression of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF1) by transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1) binding activity and phosphorylation of p38 in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated suppression of TGF1 reversed the increase in p38 phosphorylation induced by CTRP9. siRNA-mediated suppression of TGF1 or p38 significantly abrogated the effects of CTRP9 on cell proliferation and differentiation while inducing apoptosis, implying that CTRP9 stimulates wound recovery through a TGF1-dependent pathway in keratinocytes. Furthermore, intravenous injection of CTRP9 via tail vein suppressed mRNA expression of Ki67 and involucrin whereas it augmented TGF1 mRNA expression and caspase 3 activity in skin of type 1 diabetes animal models. In conclusion, our results suggest that CTRP9 has suppressive effects on hyperkeratosis, providing a potentially effective therapeutic strategy for diabetic wounds."
theoretical approach to radicalization and violent extremism that leads to terrorism,2017,"['Radicalization', 'Violent Extremism', 'Terrorism', 'Counterterrorism', 'Countering Violent Extremism']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"As Korea is changing into a multi-racial and multicultural society, the number of immigrants has exceeded two million people, making heterogeneous members in Korea society increase. The changes in Korean society are similar to those of the international migration phenomenon that occurs globally. The phenomenon that individuals of diverse nationalities leave their origin country affects the various institu-tions of origin and destination countries, playing a key role in social transformation. However, not everyone agrees with this change. There is also a movement to resist social change derived from international migration, which usually appears in the form of fundamentalism. In addition, social and economic instability is presented as a key link in the process of transforming this fundamentalism into violent extremism. It is argued that radicalization and violent extremism are root cause of recent terrorist attacks in Europe as a form of lone wolf terrorism. Even though political and religious motives are different from each case, it is remark-able to focus that radicalism and violent extremism are commonly observed in these cases as the underlying causes. Republic of Korea is not free from violent extremism spreading to Asia, making it urgent to homegrown ter-rorism and lone wolf terrorism. In order to prevent violent extremism, all aspects of social efforts are required. Therefore, it is appropriate to prevent violence from the economic, social and educational level as well as the law enforcement related to police activities. That is, the response to radicalism is characterized by a social and economic response to the improvement of the environment that promotes radicalization and the spread of violent extremism, in which not only the govern-ment but also religion, education, business, and civil society participate. In particular, it is pointed out that the social integration of social minority groups and vulnerable groups, which can be transformed into violent extrem-ism with radicalism, is the most important. This article is an exploratory research for the prevention of violent extremism in the context of Korea Peninsula, reviewing on the explanatory models on violent extremism."

It is assumed that material properties of the FG nanobeam, vary continuously through the thickness according to a power-law form. The small scale effect is taken into consideration based on nonlocal elasticity theory of Eringen. The non-classical governing differential equations of motion are derived through Hamilton’s principle and they are solved utilizing both Navier-based analytical method and an efficient and semi-analytical technique called differential transformation method (DTM). Various types of boundary conditions such as simply-supported, clamped-clamped, clamped-simply and clamped-free are assumed for edge supports. The good agreement between the presented DTM and analytical results of this article and those available in the literature validated the presented approach. It is demonstrated that the DTM has high precision and computational efficiency in the vibration analysis of FG nanobeams.

The X pattern and the + pattern are mostly shown on the rock painting which is a kind of Mongolian rock art and the symbolic meaning is interpreted as a symbol representing fire and sky and a pattern marking the place that a god down in religious activities.In petroglyph which is one of the rock art, there are the X and the + patterns, the two types of Hass patterns of the 卐 and 卍 and the transformed type with three rings as like on the rock paintings. The Has pattern is interpreted as the sign of a clan and classified into four types such as ‘Early clan symbol’, ‘Derived clan symbol’, ‘Conquer clan symbol’ and ‘Immigrated clan symbol’ in combination with other symbol patterns.The prototype of Has pattern is the + and the X pattern. They are developed into the 卐 pattern and the 卍 pattern and diversely transformed into the change of the ring such as the square, the rhombus, the circle combined with various geometric models.This tradition of petroglyphs also leads to the Turkic inscription. The Has pattern which can be found on the Turkic inscriptions is a transformed form of the X pattern and the 卐 pattern.

monitoring of wind turbine blades for flutter instability,2017,"['wind turbine', 'flutter monitoring', 'envelope process', 'Hilbert-Huang transform']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Classical flutter of wind turbine blades indicates a type of aeroelastic instability with fully attached boundary layer where a torsional blade mode couples to a flapwise bending mode, resulting in a mutual rapid growth of the amplitudes. In this paper the monitoring problem of onset of flutter is investigated from a detection point of view. The criterion is stated in terms of the exceeding of a defined envelope process of a specific maximum torsional vibration threshold. At a certain instant of time, a limited part of the previously measured torsional vibration signal at the tip of blade is decomposed through the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method, and the 1st Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) is assumed to represent the response in the flutter mode. Next, an envelope time series of the indicated modal response is obtained in terms of a Hilbert transform. Finally, a flutter onset criterion is proposed, based on the indicated envelope process. The proposed online flutter monitoring method provided a practical and direct way to detect onset of flutter during operation. The algorithm has been illustrated by a 907-DOFs aeroelastic model for wind turbines, where the tower and the drive train is modelled by 7 DOFs, and each blade by means of 50 3-D Bernoulli-Euler beam elements."

However, it remains difficult to identify the crystal variants in the simulation results, which consist of large numbers of atoms. In the present work, a method is developed to identify the austenite phase and the monoclinic martensite crystal variants in MD results. The transformation matrix of each lattice is calculated to determine the corresponding crystal variant. Evolution of the volume fraction of the crystal variants and the microstructure in Ni-Ti SMAs under thermal and mechanical boundary conditions are examined. The method is validated by comparing MD-simulated interface normals with theoretical solutions. In addition, the results show that, in certain cases, the interatomic potential used in the current study leads to inconsistent monoclinic lattices compared with crystallographic theory. Thus, a specific modification is applied and the applicability of the potential is discussed."
potential accuracy of gnss ppp- and ppk-derived heights for ellipsoidally referenced hydrographic surveys: experimental assessment and results,2017,"['GNSS-PPP', 'GNSS-PPK', 'ERS', 'ellipsoidal height', 'potential accuracy']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Ellipsodially referenced survey (ERS) is considered as one of the challenging issues in the hydrographic surveys due to the fact that the bathymetric data collected by this technique can be readily transformed either to the geodetic or the chart datum by application of some geoscientific models. Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) is a preferred technique to determine the ellipsoidal height of a vessel reference point (RP) because it provides cost-effective and unprecedentedly accurate positioning solutions. Especially, the GNSS-derived heights include heave and dynamic draft of a vessel, so as for the reduced bathymetric solutions to be potentially free from these corrections. Although over the last few decades, differential GNSS (DGNSS) has been widely adopted in the bathymetric surveys, it only provides limited accuracy of the vertical component. This technical barrier can be effectively overcome by adopting the so-called GNSS carrier phase (CPH) based techniques, enhancing accuracy of the height solution up to few centimeters. From the positioning algorithm standpoint, the CPH-based techniques are categorized under absolute and relative positioning in post-processing mode; the former is precise point positioning (PPP) correcting errors by the global or regional models, the latter is post-processed kinematic positioning (PPK) that uses the differencing technique to common error sources between two receivers. This study has focused on assessment of achievable accuracy of the ellipsoidal heights obtained from these CPH-based techniques with a view to their applications to hydrographic surveys where project area is, especially, few tens to hundreds kilometers away from the shore. Some field trials have been designed and performed so as to collect GNSS observables on static and kinematic mode. In this paper, details of these tests and processed results are presented and discussed."

Characteristics of EMT were determined by evaluating the expression levels of related markers. The expression of Elk-3 and its target Egr-1 were analyzed using Western blotting. Gene silencing of Elk-3 was performed using an siRNA knockdown system. Results: The expression levels of mesenchymal markers were increased during TGF-β1-induced EMT of hepatocytes. The expression levels of Elk-3 and Egr-1 were significantly (p<0.05) increased during the EMT of hepatocytes, in CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced mouse liver fibrotic tissues, and in human liver cirrhotic tissues. Silencing of Elk-3 and inhibition of the Ras-Elk-3 pathway with an inhibitor suppressed the expression of EMT-related markers. Moreover, Elk-3 expression was regulated by p38 MAPK phosphorylation during EMT. Conclusions: Elk-3 contributes to the progression of liver fibrosis by modulating the EMT via the regulation of Egr- 1 under MAPK signaling. (Gut Liver 2017;11:102-111)"
dynamic analysis of a multi-span beam subjected to a moving force using the frequency domain spectral element method,2017,"['Modified one-element method', 'Moving point force', 'Multi-span beam', 'Spectral element method', 'Dynamic responses']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This study extends a frequency domain modified spectral element method (SEM) from single-span beams to multi-span beams subjected to moving point forces. Each span is represented by the Timoshenko beam model. The time history of the moving point force is transformed to the frequency domain as a series of quasi-static or stationary point forces acting on the beam simultaneously. The dynamic responses are obtained by superposing the individual dynamic responses excited by each quasi-static point force. The SEM based on the original one-element method provides the exact individual dynamic responses of all spans except for the span on which the quasi-static point force is located. Thus, the exact dynamic responses for this span are obtained based on the modified one-element method by adding some correction terms that are given in closed analytical forms. The method is highly accurate and computationally efficient, as verified by comparison with other techniques such as exact theory, modal analysis method, and finite element method."

Moreover, the duration of Rent-free has also increased. However, studies related to Rent-free are very limited due to restrictions on acquiring lease contract data. In particular, no study has been conducted on the duration of Rent-free.  The duration of Rent-free may vary depending on the conditions of office market and lease contracts. This research analyzes the determinants on duration of Rent-free based on 860 lease contract of Seoul Office Market from 2009 to 2015 by applying Cox proportional hazard model.  The building""s vacancy rate, the lease term, the lease area, and the contract rent are all statistically significant and identified as major factors influencing the duration of Rent-free. In general, it is explained that the duration of Rent-free is longer when the vacancy rate is high, lease term is long, lease area is large, and the contract rent is high.  The market vacancy rate and the market rent are both significantly correlated, and it indicates that the duration of Rent-free is affected by the lease market. Market vacancy rate and market rent shows an upward trend during analysis period, and it is estimated that the duration of Rent-free also increased during the same period. In business districts, only the central business district(CBD) shows significant result. It is considered that CBD offers longer duration of Rent-free as a way of decreasing the high vacancy rate caused by oversupply of offices in CBD."

the sami galaxy survey: revising the fraction of slow rotators in ifs galaxy surveys,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The fraction of galaxies supported by internal rotation compared to galaxies stabilized by internal pressure provides a strong constraint on galaxy formation models. In integral field spectroscopy surveys, this fraction is biased because survey instruments typically only trace the inner parts of the most massive galaxies. We present aperture corrections for the two most widely used stellar kinematic quantities V/sigma and lambda(R) (spin parameter proxy). Our demonstration involves integral field data from the SAMI (Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integral-field spectrograph) Galaxy Survey and the ATLAS(3D) survey. We find a tight relation for both V/sigma and lambda(R) when measured in different apertures that can be used as a linear transformation as a function of radius, i.e. a first-order aperture correction. In degraded seeing, however, the aperture corrections are more significant as the steeper inner profile is more strongly affected by the point spread function than the outskirts. We find that V/sigma and lambda(R) radial growth curves are well approximated by second-order polynomials. By only fitting the inner profile (0.5R(e)), we successfully recover the profile out to one R-e if a constraint between the linear and quadratic parameter in the fit is applied. However, the aperture corrections for V/sigma and lambda(R) derived by extrapolating the profiles perform as well as applying a first-order correction. With our aperture-corrected lambda(R) measurements, we find that the fraction of slow rotating galaxies increases with stellar mass. For galaxies with log M-*/M-circle dot > 11, the fraction of slow rotators is 35.9 +/- 4.3 per cent, but is underestimated if galaxies without coverage beyond one R-e are not included in the sample (24.2 +/- 5.3 per cent). With measurements out to the largest aperture radius, the slow rotator fraction is similar as compared to using aperture-corrected values (38.3 +/- 4.4 per cent). Thus, aperture effects can significantly bias stellar kinematic integral field spectrograph studies, but this bias can now be removed with the method outlined here.</P>"

Consequently, Sino-scepticism has rebounded on the premise that the downturn in major African markets is an aftermath of the indentured capitalism fuelling ‘China in Africa’. However, China and Africa can instrumentalise (inter)dependency in their economic engagement, particularly as they undergo unique economic transformations.These changes reveal more diverse avenues for productive investment and beneficial economic cooperation, and demand that both sides place a great deal on appropriate responses to internal and externalist adjustments of their economies. In light of China’s strategic pivot to innovation, it is useful to recommend the exploration of the digital innovation economy where Africa is fast gaining global recognition. With the promise of cross-cultural cooperation in business and technology, the adoption, building and implementation of strategies placing innovation as an integral part of China–Africa cooperation, will ensure China’s investments support Africa’s diversification from commodities trading more constructively, and in a manner that neatly keys into the former’s multipolar vision for technological governance."

The proxy variables for growth options are the MB(market-to-book) ratio and its inverse exponential transformation. Corporate capital structure is measured by market leverage ratio, and financial constraints are measured by credit ratings and Hadlock and Pierce’s(2010) HP index. The main results of this paper can be summarized as follows.Among the proxy variables for growth options, the MB ratio has a significant and negative effect on the leverage ratio, while the inverse exponential MB ratio has a significant and positive effect, implying that the growth options have significant and negative effects on capital structure. However, the t-values and economic significance of estimated coefficient for the inverse exponential MB ratio are larger than the corresponding values for the MB ratio. Moreover, the s increase in regression models that use the inverse exponential MB ratio as an explanatory variable. Overall, these results show that the relationship between growth options and capital structure is negative and convex.In tests of both static and dynamic model of capital structure, using a nonlinear (inverse exponential) MB ratio than a linear MB ratio yields stronger explanatory power for the growth options effect on capital structure. That is, our empirical results, obtained using both static and dynamic model of capital structure, suggest that the relationship between growth options and capital structure is negative and convex. However, this negative and convex effect of growth options on capital structure is weakened among firms that face more severe financial constraints.In conclusion, the nonlinear MB ratio, as a proxy variable of growth options, yields stronger explanatory power for the growth options effect on capital structure than the linear MB ratio in tests of both static and dynamic model of capital structure. However, firms characterized by more severe financial constraints are more likely to exhibit the weaker effects of growth options on capital structure. In addition, this paper sheds new light on a channel through which the growth options have influences on capital structure."

The node dynamics of vehicle with a lower-level controller is assumed to be covered by a multiplicative uncertainty model. The vehicular platoon control system is skillfully decomposed into an uncertain part and a diagonal system by applying linear transformation and eigenvalue decomposition on information flow graph. Then the requirements of robust stability and distance tracking error are equivalent to the H-infinity norm of decoupled sub-systems. Comparative simulations with a non-robust controller and different communication topologies are conducted to demonstrate the robust stability and distance tracking performances of the proposed method.

Of them, analyzing the cases of ‘switching’ of the ‘convertible’ fashion and understanding its pattern structures, this study realized the design of the patterns and the production of the products of the ‘neckline-switching’ diversified fashion and verified them with models. This study would seek the aesthetic characteristics of ‘neckline-switching’ products, including eccentricity, irregularity and pleasure, based on the theoretical discussion on the diversified fashion design that can convert the shapes of models and develop design models that would increase the creation of added values with the design of patterns and the production of products, reflecting these attributes. In sum, ‘neckline-switching’ fashion products would help meet the expectation of the customers who look for new fashion experiences and present new possibilities with the designs appropriate for the tendency of pursuing expressions, based on the innovative thinking of the designers who plan creations."
comparative adsorption of crude oil using mango (mangnifera indica) shell and mango shell activated carbon,2017,"['Activated carbon', 'Adsorption', 'Crude oil', 'Mango shell', 'Optimization']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Mango shell (MS) and mango shell activated carbon (MSAC) was used to adsorb crude oil from water at various experimental conditions. The MSAC was prepared by carbonization at 450°C and chemical activation using strong H₃PO₄ acid. The adsorbents were characterized with Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy. Investigations carried out included the effects of parametric variations of different adsorbate dose, adsorbent dose, time, temperature, pH and mixing speed on the adsorption of crude oil. The equilibrium isotherm for the adsorption process was determined using Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin and Dubinin Radushkevich isotherm models. Temkin isotherm was found to fit the equilibrium data reasonably well than others. The result demonstrated that MSAC was more effective for crude oil adsorption than raw mango shell. Optimum conditions were also presented. The enhanced effect from activation was justified statistically using Analysis of Variance and Bonferroni-Holm Posthoc significance test. The pseudo first order kinetics gave a better fit for crude oil adsorption with both MS and MSAC."

The heat sink and the peripheral parts of the power converter were set as the thermal analysis model. The external temperature under natural convection condition was set at 25℃ and the heat flux value corresponding to the exothermic parts such as MOSFET was inputted. As a result of the ANSYS simulation with the above thermal analysis condition, the heat sink of the power converter showed a maximum heat distribution of 28.4℃, and the maximum temperature of the power converter including the heat sink was about 59.2℃. From this result, the size (L) 250mm in the horizontal direction of the heat sink selected at the beginning of the development was reduced to 210mm by the simulation result. Experiments were conducted under maximum load conditions (2.5kW) using a reduced 210mm heat sink and two original 250mm heat sinks. There was little temperature difference between the two cases except for the wire part. Looking at the heat distribution, the temperature is high in the busbar and switching device, and is measured at about 51℃ for MOSFET and 33℃ for heat sink. Without ANSYS simulation, it was possible to predict about 30℃ for the heat sink and about 55℃ for the MOSFET. Finally, the resonant current of the transformer with respect to the 2.5kW resistive load, the converter output voltage and the output current were obtained, and the output voltage of 250V could be stably maintained even at the battery voltage of 24V."

In order to analyze the economic spillover effect of the increase in the demand of a specific industry rather than the final demand such as consumption, investment, and export, which is the ultimate objective of production activity, we need to transform the original input-output coefficient matrix to obtain a net economic spillover effect due to an increase in expenditure. On the other hand, if the exogenous method is not applied, there is a concern that the spending increase of the industry will lead to an increase in the intermediate demand for itself, and the economic spillover effect will not be properly accounted for. The purpose of this study is to investigate the differences in the economic spillover effects of exogenous methods along with various forms of endogenous final demands to an increase in residential building construction expenditure.Based on the analysis, we find that the economic spillover effects when exogenous method is not applied are higher in all cases than those when exogenous method is applied, and the differences are also far from negligible. This result suggests that it is necessary to pay more attention to the model selection when analyzing the economic spillover effect using the input-output model."

(N, n)-preemptive priority disciplines enable system engineers to fine-tune the performances of different classes of customers arriving to the system. Due to this virtue of controllability, (N, n)-preemptive priority queueing models can be applied to various types of systems in which the service performances of different classes of customers need to be adjusted for a complex objective. In this paper, we extend the existing (N, n)-preemptive resume and (N, n)-preemptive repeat-identical priority queueing models to the (N, n)-preemptive repeat-different priority queueing model. We derive the queue-length distributions in the M/G/1 queueing model with two classes of customers, under the (N, n)-preemptive repeat-different priority discipline. In order to derive the queue-length distributions, we employ an analysis of the effective service time of a low-priority customer, a delay cycle analysis, and a joint transformation method. We then derive the first and second moments of the queue lengths of high- and low-priority customers. We also present a numerical example for the first and second moments of the queue length of high- and low-priority customers. Through doing this, we show that, under the (N, n)-preemptive repeat-different priority discipline, the first and second moments of customers with high priority are bounded by some upper bounds, regardless of the service characteristics of customers with low priority. This property may help system engineers design such service systems that guarantee the mean and variance of delay for primary users under a certain bounds, when preempted services have to be restarted with another service time resampled from the same service time distribution."

The FT-IR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) spectra of the corncob indicated that the carbonyl and carboxylic groups were major binding sites with Cd(II) ions. Corncob removed successfully 99% of the Cd(II) ions in the aqueous solution at pH 6. The adsorption process was fast and isotherm data better fit to the Langmuir isotherm than the Freundlich isotherm models.

According to powder X-ray diffraction and infrared spectra, LSTs had lamellar structure with different interlayer distance with respect to alkyl chain length. Microscopic study revealed that LSTs particles had flat shape with hundreds of nanometers diameter and tens of nanometers thickness, regardless of alkyl chain length. Upon reductive calcination at 400 degrees C under H-2 flow, LSTs transformed to face centered cubic Ag fiber having bundle of Ag filaments having similar to 1 mu m diameter. Through Scherrer's equation, microscopic analyses and N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherm, it was revealed that silver nanoparticle preferentially aggregated to one direction during reduction to form FSPs, and molecules could access through the inter-particle space in the aggregates. Conversion of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol catalyzed by FSPs was analyzed with Langmuir-Hinshelwood model.

In this paper, we propose an empty parking space detection method based on the around-view monitoring system. The proposed method can detect available parking spaces by creating a map of parking line features. First, we create a map of parking line features using line filters and detect parking line candidates using the Hough transform on the feature map. Since there exist valid and invalid lines among the parking line candidates, we analyze the lines’ density and connectivity to select valid lines. Several valid lines can be represented as a one-line model created by clustering. Using the features of the parking area (width and height of the parking space) among the line models can remove useless lines and extract the sideline of the parking space. A feature map of the parking lines is used to ensure the robustness of the sideline model. Finally, we can detect the parking space using sideline models.

effect of liquid-crystalline epoxy backbone structure on thermal conductivity of epoxy–alumina composites,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>In a series of papers published recently, we clearly demonstrated that the most important factor governing the thermal conductivity of epoxy-Al2O3 composites is the backbone structure of the epoxy. In this study, three more epoxies based on diglycidyl ester-terminated liquid-crystalline epoxy (LCE) have been synthesized to draw conclusions regarding the effect of the epoxy backbone structure on the thermal conductivity of epoxy-alumina composites. The synthesized structures were characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1-NMR) and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, and optical microscopy were also employed to examine the thermal and optical properties of the synthesized LCEs and the cured composites. All three LCE resins exhibited typical liquid-crystalline behaviors: clear solid crystalline state below the melting temperature (T-m), sharp crystalline melting at T-m, and transition to nematic phase above T-m with consequent isotropic phase above the isotropic temperature (T-i). The LCE resins displayed distinct nematic liquid-crystalline phase over a wide temperature range and retained liquid-crystalline phase after curing, with high thermal conductivity of the resulting composite. The thermal conductivity values ranged from 3.09 W/m-K to 3.89 W/m-K for LCE-Al2O3 composites with 50 vol.% filler loading. The steric effect played a governing role in the difference. The neat epoxy resin thermal conductivity was obtained as 0.35 W/m-K to 0.49 W/m-K based on analysis using the Agari-Uno model. The results clearly support the objective of this study in that the thermal conductivity of the LCE-containing networks strongly depended on the epoxy backbone structure and the degree of ordering in the cured network.</P>"
on effects of rail fastener failure on vehicle/track interactions,2017,"['vehicle/track interaction', 'rail fastener failure', 'track random irregularity', 'probabilistic method', 'power spectral density']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Rail support failure is inevitably subjected to track geometric deformations. Due to the randomness and evolvements of track irregularities, it is naturally a hard work to grasp the trajectories of dynamic responses of railway systems. This work studies the influence of rail fastener failure on dynamic behaviours of wheel/rail interactions and the railway tracks by jointly considering the effects of track random irregularities. The failure of rail fastener is simulated by setting the stiffness and damping of rail fasteners to be zeroes in the compiled vehicle-track coupled model. While track random irregularities will be transformed from the PSD functions using a developed probabilistic method. The novelty of this work lays on providing a method to completely reveal the possible responses of railway systems under jointly excitation of track random irregularities and rail support failure. The numerical results show that rail fastener failure has a great influence on both the wheel/rail interactions and the track vibrations if the number of rail fastener failure is over three. Besides, the full views of time-dependent amplitudes and probabilities of dynamic indices can be clearly presented against different failing status."

Also, the expression levels of elongation of long-chain fatty acids family members 6 were decreased in the lung tissue of IPF patients compared with these of control. Stearic acid significantly reduced the TGF- β1-induced cell proliferation and the TGF- β1-induced the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) and collagen type-I in MRC-5 cells. Moreover, Stearic acid significantly inhibited the TGF- β1-induced the expression levels of p-Smad2/3 and ROS generation in MRC- 5 cells treated with TGF- β1.

Second, as a result of analyzing the research model, the personality of the teachers has shown a significant influence on the realization of respect for the rights of children. The directors’ moral leadership has shown significant mediating effects and direct effects."
effects of the wall boundary conditions of a showerhead plasma reactor on the uniformity control of rf plasma deposition,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Technical difficulties hinder the formation of uniform deposition profiles near the electrode edge during a deposition in a showerhead capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) reactor. The discharge structure, gas flow, and radial distribution of the source gas outward from the electrode edge are subject to change significantly, which in turn affects the spatial distributions of the radical fluxes toward the electrode. To control the local non-uniformity of deposition profiles in the SiH4/NH3/N-2/He CCP discharges for a hydrogenated silicon nitride (SiNxHy) film, the effects of the reactor components-including the sidewall boundary condition, electrode spacing, and showerhead design-were investigated using an axisymmetric fluid model. When the sidewall is electrically grounded, the deposition rate profiles of the SiNxHy film remain consistently convex (in which the deposition rate at the reactor center is locally much higher than that near the electrode edge), regardless of electrode spacing. However, when the sidewall surface is dielectric, the deposition rate profile can be transformed between a convex and a concave shape (in which the deposition rate at the reactor center is locally much lower than that near the electrode edge) by varying electrode spacing. The showerhead design also enables the modification of edge deposition profiles by redistribution of the local depletion rate of radicals. The simulation results agree very well with the experimental measurement. Published by AIP Publishing.</P>"

Especially, this study was focused on anti-KORUS FTA movements in Republic of Korea.  The creation of free trade area by free trade agreements is a main example of regional integration on bilateralism. Especially, KORUS FTA has the implications: ① in economics, highly comprehensive Free Trade Agreement, ② in politics, strengthening ROK-US Alliance, ③ in international politics, fixation of Republic of Korea on US-centric world order.  For the purpose of this study, we focused on Anti-KORUS FTA Movements Headquarter that was leading organization on anti-KORUS FTA movements in Republic of Korea and established the models of collective action frames that were worthy methods for capture behaviors of social movement organizations. This composition had creative meanings for analysis of the interaction of state and society on a main issue of the world politics.  This study confirmed that the feature of collective action frame is distinguished by three sides: ① diagnostic frame:“identification of issues and verification of causes by social movement organization”, ② motivational framing: “the construction of appropriate vocabularies of motive by social movement organization”, ③ prognostic frame: “theoretical and practical prescriptions for issues by social movement organization”. Furthermore, confirmed that the process of collective action frame is divided into three dimensions: ① discursive process: “the speech acts and written communications of movement members”, ② strategic process: “to achieve a specific purpose-to recruit new members, to mobilize adherents, to acquire resources, and so fourth by social movement organization”, ③ contested process: “embroilment of all members within a social movement organization in the politics of signification”.  Based on this confirmation, this study was focused on the prognostic frame in three sides of the feature of collective action frame and on the strategic process in three dimensions of the process of collective action frame. Especially, the strategic process is divided into four dimensions: ① frame bridging: “the linking of two or more ideologically congruent but structurally unconnected frames”, ② frame amplification: “the idealization, embellishment, clarification, or invigoration of existing values or beliefs”, ③ frame extension: “the expansion of existing values or beliefs aimed at potential adherents”, ④ frame transformation: “the changing old values or beliefs to new ones”."
원격탐사의 지하수 수자원 적용 사례 고찰,2017,"['Remote Sensing', 'DEM', 'GRACE', 'Groundwater Storage', 'InSAR', 'Displacement']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Several research cases using remote sensing methods to analyze changes of storage and dynamics of groundwater aquifer were reviewed in this paper. The status of groundwater storage, in an area with regional scale, could be qualitatively inferred from geological feature, surface water altimetry and topography, distribution of vegetation, and difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration. These qualitative indicators could be measured by geological lineament analysis, airborne magnetic survey, DEM analysis, LAI and NDVI calculation, and surface energy balance modeling. It is certain that GRACE and InSAR have received remarkable attentions as direct utilization from satellite data for quantification of groundwater storage and dynamics. GRACE, composed of twin satellites having acceleration sensors, could detect global or regional microgravity changes and transform them into mass changes of water on surface and inside of the Earth. Numerous studies in terms of groundwater storage using GRACE sensor data were performed with several merits such that (1) there is no requirement of sensor data, (2) auxiliary data for quantification of groundwater can be entirely obtained from another satellite sensors, and (3) algorithms for processing measured data have continuously progressed from designated data management center. The limitations of GRACE for groundwater storage measurement could be defined as follows: (1) In an area with small scale, mass change quantification of groundwater might be inaccurate due to detection limit of the acceleration sensor, and (2) the results would be overestimated in case of combination between sensor and field survey data. InSAR can quantify the dynamic characteristics of aquifer by measuring vertical micro displacement, using linear proportional relation between groundwater head and vertical surface movement. However, InSAR data might now constrain their application to arid or semi-arid area whose land cover appear to be simple, and are hard to apply to the area with the anticipation of loss of coherence with surface. Development of GRACE and InSAR sensor data preprocessing algorithms optimized to topography, geology, and natural conditions of Korea should be prioritized to regionally quantify the mass change and dynamics of the groundwater resources of Korea."

Recently, many countries in Europe including Germany and Taiwan switched their recruiting system from the compulsory to the volunteer forces in which military service is considered as a professional vocation. There were many changes in the 21st century due to the end of the Cold War, democratization, aging populations, and so forth.  In case of ROK there were many changes, too. The veterans’ extra point system was done away with by the Constitutional Court in Dec. 23, 1999. But recently the reintroduction of the veterans’ extra point system is being raised by the Ministry of Defense and politicians. Under a revised standard new draft restricts the proportion of veterans’ extra point. As a result, it can be constitutional and reasonable.  Considering that the conscription system is a system that is compatible with the principle of equality, national sovereignty, and republicanism, and the fact that it is currently suspended in the United States and Germany, it is desirable to activate the professional agent continuing conscription system.  After the reunification, the transition to all-volunteer force can be considered, and the U.S. example can be a model. In case of U.S. The Vietnam War and the unfairness of the draft system played a role in the change of draft system. The Nixon administration suggested the reasonable method to use the budget and human power saved by the change into all-volunteer force in the Gates Report. The effective promotion of policy, active persuasion through mass media changed public opinion. It demonstrates many things to the ROK. Along with the change of international environment and the consciousness of people and clear goal toward the transformation of the all-volunteer force of administration will lead to the legislation of the National Assembly."

The experiments were designed to simulate future scenarios where meteoric water infiltrates through the vadose zones into the interior of the tank filled with layers of grout or hydrated lime, and then contacts the residual waste. Effluent concentrations of U and Tc were monitored and compared among three different packing columns (waste only, waste + grout, and waste + grout + hydrated lime). Geochemical modeling of the effluent compositions was conducted to determine saturation indices of uranium solid phases that could control the solubility of uranium. The results indicate that addition of hydrated lime strongly stabilized the uranium through transforming uranium to a highly insoluble calcium uranate (CaUO<SUB>4</SUB>) or similar phase, whereas no significant stabilization effect of grout or hydrated lime was observed on Tc leachability.

The embodiment of great mercy to relieve all sentient beings and to practice mercy is Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva. The Mahayana Bodhisattva thought, which is the mother of all living beings and becomes a sanctuary and solves the temporal affliction of this world, forms the basis of a dynamic faith and practice culture of Buddhist believers in the subordinate Buddhism, it is an ideological eruption that solves their religious thirst.‘Avalokiteśvara Mantra', constantly shouting the name of the Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva, a solver of troubles and problems of believer and the savior, plays a role of collecting the mind of the believer. Furthermore, the believer himself experiences the ontological transformation by inducing the experience to become one with the object of faith. In other Words, the object of faith functions as a mediator of practice at any moment. It is a function that performs a transformative function of making the believer subject equal to the object of faith. The power of faith toward the object of faith gradually promotes the dramatic experience that the object and the subject become united by promoting the self practice. This phenomenon is similar to the mystery experience in the mystic tradition.The pursuit of the ultimate goal of individual religious tradition or community through various sounds (religious language), such as Avalokiteśvara Mantra, makes various emotional changes and mental and physical healing possible. In addition, it can extend the horizon of awareness by making change of consciousness through non-routine experience by highly intensive training.The ‘Avalokiteśvara Mantra', which simply recites the Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva, is itself a ritual ceremonial gesture and practice method, and co-ordinates the complex religious function that includes the attribute of prayer as ‘Avalokiteśvara Prayer'. In other words, it is verbal rite, performance and prayer itself. Furthermore, the person performing the ‘verbal ritual' called ‘Avalokiteśvara Mantra' conducts various roles of religion as the subject of the ritual, the performer, and the subject of prayer. Linguistic rituals tend to personalize practical rituals. And rituals in language are more dynamic, internally repletive way of salvation instead of somewhat formal, stereotyped rituals, done by gestures and anti-ritualism. Avalokiteśvara Mantra can be understood as a typical mantra performing method that intentionally embodies the state of consciousness which gives religious insight by breaking from daily consciousness by using language as a tool of practice. and it is an example that can be adequately analyzed through the concept of deautomatization and atered sates of cnsciousness in that it aims at religious insight that transcends language by utilizing language.I wonder how the Avalokiteśvara faith, which has been passed down through Mahayana Buddhism and has been handed down to the basement of faith and practice, will converge on the desires and wishes of modern people living in this age and become an ideal model."

Disney Animation has long been loved by satisfying the various desires of viewers. Disney however, has been criticized for hiding and reproducing first world values - white centric, capitalism, and male centric ideologies. In addition, Disney`s ideology was regarded as old-fashioned and no longer attracted public attention. This article looked at their efforts to overcome such a situation in Moana. In this paper, I looked at the animation Moana from the character, mythological background, and narrative aspects. First, Moana and Maui, characters in Moana did not overdraw the physical characteristics of the Polynesians. It did not Westernize and devoted itself to the characteristics of the Polynesians, thereby breaking away from the first world perspective. Next, Moana borrowed Polynesian creation mythology as a motif. At the same time, it gave universality to the local myth through transformations such as emphasizing femininity in the original myth and adding Greek mythological elements. Finally, while traditional female characters in Disney animations were obedient and sacrificial to men, and although Moana followed the typical character of Disney animation, which is a hero`s growth story, Moana, a female hero of Moana discovered her identity and showed her altruism, thus escaping the existing old model.

He modifies the internal reason of the simplest formulation named as ‘sub-Humean model’, so that complements a formulation that ‘A has a reason to φ only if A should φ (or a conclusion to φ) by a sound deliberative route from the motivation that he has in his actual motivational set.’ He, on the other hand, asks an externalist that the agent should acquire the motivation because he comes to believe the reason statement, and that he should do the latter, moreover, because, in some way, he is considering the matter aright. McDowell rejects Williams’s assumed external interpretation and suggests an alternative external reasons formulation, challenging Williams’ claim that only internals reason is true. He suggests ‘upbringing’ and ‘conversion’ as examples of the fact that the external reason statement is true. However, McDowell’s reason for action of ‘phronimos’ seems to be difficult to be transformed into agent A’ s reason for action as a result of examining from the aspect of explanatory reason and normative reason. The reason for the act is dependent on the motive and deliberative constraints of the particular agent and therefore the explanatory reason and the normative reason are not separated. McDowell’s external interpretation assumes another normative reason, separate from the explanatory reason. Another rationality is required when separating the two reason. However, there is no place for rationality that externalists want, and there is only a reason to be found in people’s utterances that ‘A has a reason to φ’."

integrating sustainability in luxury fashion supply networks: an empirical investigation of leather and silk,2017,"['sustainability', 'luxury fashion', 'supply network', 'silk', 'leather']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"State of the Art: Sustainability Integration in the Luxury Fashion Industry Introduction to Luxury Fashion ‘Luxury’, which comes from the Latin word ‘luxus’, refers to exaggerated life, glamour, comfort and wealth (Dubois, Czellar & Laurent, 2005). In the ancient world, luxury was associated with wealth, exclusivity, and power. After the 17th century, European countries’ economic democratization contributed to the reduction of existing sumptuary laws. Trade increased and larger segments of the population began to afford luxury products. Consequently, luxury moved from being limited to serve the common good to being a satisfaction of private needs. At the end of the 19th century, following the second industrial revolution, luxury earned its modern meaning of being enjoyable beyond the necessities of life (Fionda and Moore, 2009). The democratization of luxury resulted in mass luxury in which luxury brands have extended themselves to affordable offerings (Cristini et al., 2017). Luxury was long associated with the premium quality (Brun and Castelli, 2013), whereas today the technical reproduction of luxury is indulged by mass-produced brands (Cristini et al, 2017). Thus, one could argue that commercial drivers have taken over the industry whereby executives are increasingly seeking ways to transform creativity into profitability. Accordingly, the luxury market has experienced noticeable growth. The global luxury goods market reached a value of € 1.081B, with a growth rate of 4%, in 2016 (Bain & Company, 2016). Nevertheless, despite growth and high profit margins, the global fashion market is affected by macroeconomic, socio-political and natural events. For example, the short-term doubling in cotton prices brought many problems in 2011. Furthermore, scarce natural resources and rising commodity prices greatly challenge the ability of luxury fashion companies to remain profitable. The new luxury paradigm of being more accessible challenges not only sustainability but also operational aspects. The reputation of the luxury industry suffers from consumer concerns over poor labour standards in production, blood diamonds, irresponsible gold-mining practices and animal cruelty in global production networks (Hennigs et al, 2013; Moore, 2011). We therefore question how and to what extent luxury could play a positive role in our mass-consuming generation to slow down the pace for materialism and to better implement sustainability in globally dispersed production networks. Whilst sociologists, marketing and branding experts, have shown interest in luxury management, researchers in the field of operations and supply chain management have paid little attention to the topic: the first paper in the field appeared less than a decade ago (Brun et al., 2008), and furthermore, as of January 2017, there appear to be only 87 papers published in Scopus-indexed journals with ‘‘supply chain OR oper*’’ AND ‘’luxury’’ in the keywords. Henceforth, the current financial, environmental, economic and cultural crises could be considered significant drivers for how luxury operations could be advanced in the move toward sustainability. The focus of this paper is luxury personal goods such as fashion and accessories. The Relevance of Sustainability for Luxury Fashion Following the supply chain revolution of the 1990’s (Mohanty and Prakash, 2013) and the removal of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement in 2005, the fashion industry has become a global force in production and distribution. Globalisation has led to increasing outsourcing of production by fashion companies to a network of suppliers and subcontractors. The industry is characterized by shorter product life cycles and highly volatile market demand (Choi, 2013) alongside downward price pressure, international sourcing, high product variety and low predictability (Perry and Towers, 2013). To this end, fashion companies rely on sophisticated information and logistics systems to remain competitive in the market. Nonetheless, the fashion industry is somewhat inflexible toward major external changes outside the organizations’ direct control (Kozlowski et al., 2015). There is also a potential conflict between corporate responsibility and overarching commercial pressures in the fashion industry (Perry et al., 2015). According to the definition of sustainable development by The United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED, 1987), current needs should be met without endangering future generations’ rights to satisfy theirs. Luxury fashion companies must therefore acknowledging resource scarcity and other sustainability issues, and take collective actions for an authentic shift to create unique and sustainable businesses. To be profitable and sustainable, “luxury companies must adjust their definition of excellence that is no longer associated with shallow glamour but with positive engagement and deeper values” (Hennigs et al, 2013, p.33). An Overview of Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) Sustainability in SCM has captured academics’ interest since the early 1990s. Despite the growing interest, some fundamental issues still need to be addressed to provide novel models. The majority of the practices that make up green supply chain management (GSCM) models are modifications of existing practices (Pagell and Wu, 2009). However, earlier studies also stress that these programs might not be sufficient to become sustainable. Hence, it would be insightful to examine which components and which practices are required to make ‘sustainable’ chains. Social sustainability also requires deeper consideration. Wu and Pagell (2011) investigated how organizations deal with short-term pressures to remain economically viable during sustainability implementation, but did not consider social aspects of sustainability. Lee and Klassen (2008) identified the important drivers and enablers which promote environmental management capabilities in SME suppliers, but did not address social sustainability or specific measures for suppliers’ environmental management capabilities. Zhu and Cote (2004) and Vachon and Klassen (2006) demonstrated how to extend green practices, but again social aspects were not encompassed. Similarly, Caniato et al (2012) identified drivers that push companies to adopt green practices, various practices that could be used to advance environmental sustainability and environmental performance indicators measured by fashion companies. However, the social component was excluded. The recognition of corporate social responsibility (CSR) as a business activity is highlighted by the launch of ISO 26000; nonetheless, as illustrated earlier, extant SCM literature has mostly neglected the social aspects of sustainability. Despite a number of studies on aspects including social responsibility and consumer trust (Castaldo et al., 2008), sustainability reporting (Lozano and Huisingh, 2011), sustainable supply management (Ageron, Gunasekaran, & Spalanzani, 2012), and supplier selection problems (Jia et al., 2015), social issues demand more investigation (Perry and Towers, 2013). Sustaining an efficient global supply chain without compromising social responsibility (Perry et al., 2015). Embedding social and environmental management into SCM is needed yet challenging. Significant progress has been made in studies of the buyer-supplier relationship over the past decades, however despite some notable exceptions on green SCM (Zhu and Cote 2004; Zhu et al. 2008; Yu et al. 2014), the development of SSCM literature appears to focus on a single entity rather than the entire chain or network. Social and environmental performance of suppliers is an area of mounting concern, and collectively, sufficient coordination between supply chain partners is greatly needed. Many small and medium-sized suppliers encounter challenges in responding to environmental pressures due to limited capabilities and available resources (Lee and Klassen, 2008), and the most critical environmental and social issues in supply chains are generated by suppliers located in the second tier or further upstream (Tachizawa and Wong, 2014). Therefore, a holistic examination of the entire chain is required. In this vein, Pagell and Wu (2009) examined the chain as an entirety by explicitly addressing both environmental and social outcomes and by asking what unique behavioural patterns are needed for SSCM. However, the adoption of some of the practices is quite limited, which suggests the existence of additional contingencies. Their study called for future studies to explore the role of specific industries e.g. textiles. To this end, Ho and Choi (2012) investigated why fashion companies go green and evaluated sustainable supply chains. Nevertheless, the study was a single case study and did not consider potential differences in terms of antecedents affecting small and large companies. Curwen et al. (2013), interestingly, sought to document current challenges the fashion and apparel industry faces while developing sustainable apparel. Yet again, an imperative need arises to further explore the connections among product design, production processes and supply chain stages through a multidisciplinary approach. On the whole, the phenomena of sustainability has been interpreted in a variety of ways, ranging from a philosophical perspective to business management approaches (Ahi and Searcy, 2013), but more research is needed to show more than how to be ‘less unsustainable’. Traditional business research must go beyond studies focusing on profit with a rather short-term orientation and instead embrace components of how to create truly sustainable businesses. Considering the aforementioned gaps observed in the extant literature, the following research questions were formulated to investigate the phenomena of social and environmental sustainability at supply chain level within the luxury context, where ethical aspects are becoming increasingly critical for success (Brun and Castelli, 2013). RQ1: How do luxury fashion companies integrate sustainability into their supply networks? RQ2: How do contingent factors impact sustainability integration in luxury fashion supply networks? RQ3: Which behavioural patterns could be used to develop a sustainable supply chain configuration for the luxury fashion industry? Research Methodology Data was drawn from case studies of two Italian supply chains producing luxury silk and leather goods, encompassing 10 companies, with a focus on the individual supply chain as the level of analysis. These two supply chain were theoretically sampled to provide diversity in organizational characteristics and supply network relationships that could explain different approaches to the integration of sustainability into the entire chain. The research design followed Yin (1994) and previous studies in operations and SCM. Face to face interviews were conducted with senior managers of different functions in each supply chain during 2015-16. In most of the companies, responsibility for sustainability was divided and integrated into the jobs of multiple managers, meaning that there was no single individual assigned to sustainability. Additionally, the managers interviewed were often in charge of one or more functions, which helped reduce the number of interviews but increased interview content. The interview topic guide was developed from the literature review, and the theoretical constructs underpinning the interview protocol were then used to create an initial coding scheme for data. Data analysis was done inductively, by developing a framework from the cases while exploiting the theoretical concepts in the categorization of codes. The coding process was followed for all cases as an iterative process to assure consistency. Coding was not considered complete until a consensus was reached on each construct. Data analysis involved within and cross-case analysis. Results: Toward a Framework for Sustainable Luxury Supply Chains This study explored the luxury fashion industry from supply chain and operations management standpoint. Findings revealed seven key categories by which luxury fashion companies integrated environmental and social sustainability into their operations: Category 1: Sustainable product design, Category 2: Operations management, Category 3: Performance measurement, Category 4: Sourcing management, Category 5: Decent work and labour management, Category 6: Commitment to sustainability and organisational perceptions and Category 7: Longevity of suppliers. Firstly, natural resource scarcity was acknowledged by all 10 companies. To this end, some practices, including use of eco-friendly materials, hazardous chemical elimination, textile waste reuse, were applied to the fashion design stage with an attempt to mitigate the environmental impact of subsequent operations. Life cycle assessment (LCA was observed to be a significant tool among sample companies. Nonetheless, higher investment costs to employ more innovative solutions and to advance laboratory tests, higher prices for more ecological materials, and lack of knowledge in terms of fibre and textile components due to supply chain complexity prevented companies from advancing product stewardship. Regarding operations management, water emerged as a significant area where sample companies implemented incremental techniques, including natural tanning, on-site wastewater treatment, water purification and water reuse. Nevertheless, vertical integration, which was getting weaker in the luxury fashion industry, resulted in fashion companies having difficulties in the execution of their suppliers’ environmental performance. Practices implemented in this category were individual company attempts rather than collective action plans. It was not quite feasible to mitigate the environmental impact of independent networks where the buying firm outsourced its business functions to third party suppliers. In order to deal with lack of control and monitoring, sustainability must be understood as a concept to be integrated into the core business strategy with measurable indicators. Furthermore, traceability emerged as a pivotal topic. However, the complexity of global luxury fashion supply chains brought complications. Both supply chains showed that there was lack of knowledge about products’ production history. Due to globalization, countries with low operational costs appeared to leverage their competitive advantage. Changing market conditions resulted in the loss of, for example, silk production in Italy. Silkworm cultivation did not take place in Italy any longer, resulting in confusion regarding outsourced materials’ environmental and social records. High product variety and fragmentation of the production network made it difficult for companies to ensure full traceability. To this end, trust and knowledge transfer were weak, which could be improved to link non-economic goals with financial objectives. Another interesting result was that supplier audits were mostly made within first tier direct suppliers’ facilities. In some cases suppliers were provided with online self-assessment tools that were monitored by buying firms. Yet, buying firms and manufacturers required more efficient inspection methods and more realistic mitigation strategies. Ensuring social sustainability is hindered by complications such as lack of visibility and financial burdens. Consequently, technical and motivational dynamic capability development needed to be proactively initiated by focal companies. As stressed by earlier studies, sustainability must be a shared effort within all functions of a company and across its supply network. Sustainability could be disseminated across the chain only when all supply chain actors, including retailers, suppliers and sub-contractors, connect, understand and collaborate with each other. Correspondingly, it became clear that sustainability management required strong organizational commitment for which an alignment between financial and non-financial goals was greatly required. Hence, education and training activities received growing attention. In conclusion, the sample companies asked their supply chain partners to become sustainable for two main reasons, (i) to make the chain stronger, and (ii) to jointly learn and improve performance. Long-term relationships and supplier stability, as evidenced in the leather supply chains, could cultivate trust, which would result in advanced organizational and operational performance improvements. Supplier engagement and collaboration associated with knowledge dissemination could further enable companies to improve sustainability, and lastly innovation capabilities were imperative."

formation and eruption of a flux rope from the sigmoid active region noaa 11719 and associated m6.5 flare: a multi-wavelength study,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>We investigate the formation, activation, and eruption of a flux rope (FR) from the sigmoid active region NOAA 11719 by analyzing E(UV), X-ray, and radio measurements. During the pre-eruption period of similar to 7 hr, the AIA 94 angstrom. images reveal the emergence of a coronal sigmoid through the interaction between two J-shaped bundles of loops, which proceeds with multiple episodes of coronal loop brightenings and significant variations in the magnetic flux through the photosphere. These observations imply that repetitive magnetic reconnections likely play a key role in the formation of the sigmoidal FR in the corona and also contribute toward sustaining the temperature of the FR higher than that of the ambient coronal structures. Notably, the formation of the sigmoid is associated with the fast morphological evolution of an S-shaped filament channel in the chromosphere. The sigmoid activates toward eruption with the ascent of a large FR in the corona, which is preceded by the decrease in photospheric magnetic flux through the core flaring region, suggesting tether-cutting reconnection as a possible triggering mechanism. The FR eruption results in a two-ribbon M6.5 flare with a prolonged rise phase of similar to 21 minutes. The flare exhibits significant deviation from the standard flare model in the early rise phase, during which a pair of J-shaped flare ribbons form and apparently exhibit converging motions parallel to the polarity inversion line, which is further confirmed by the motions of hard X-ray footpoint sources. In the later stages, the flare follows the standard flare model and the source region undergoes a complete sigmoid-to-arcade transformation.</P>"
what piketty knew (but dared not ask henry james): fin-de-siecle american capitalism and queer resistance in the ambassadors,2017,"['Thomas Piketty', 'rentier capitalism', 'fin-de-siecle America', 'point of view', 'L`Education sentimentale', 'logic of cultural production', 'queer resistance']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Thomas Piketty has cited Henry James in his globally influential Capital in the Twenty-First Century (2013), arguing that he represents in his novels the social reality of nineteenth-century rentier capitalism. Drawing attention to this analysis, I raise in this paper two questions: 1) Is the historical reality of James`s America towards the turn of the twentieth century, as Piketty assumes, a variant on a similar reality in Austen and Balzac`s Europe? 2) Is realist fiction a source reservoir of economic reality per se in the given historical era? To defend fiction`s power to creatively represent social reality, and, specifically, James`s unique success in capturing the particular economic reality of fin-de-siecle America, I focus upon The Ambassadors (1903). Fredric Jameson has persistently denied James a true historical awareness, arguing that James`s falsely enlarged technique of point of view leads to an avoidance of the material reality of his time. Opposing Jameson, I argue that James`s choice to narrow the diegetic world of the novel to the limited experience of the novel`s hero, Lambert Strether, aptly represents the reality of American capitalism at the time a system which was, if we correct Piketty`s undifferentiated idea of rentier capitalism by a rigorous distinction of its phases, at that moment transforming itself from industrial capitalism to financial capitalism. Strether, who in many particulars transgresses hegemonic masculinity, provides the perfect lens for examining the complexly gendered reality of this transformation. I introduce Gustave Flaubert`s L`Education sentimentale as a model text through which we can understand how James imagined the conflict between the dominating logic of economic production and the resisting logic of cultural production in the Bourdieusian sense: though the middle-aged Strether is a loser in the practical sense, James makes him a true hero. I argue that James challenges the pervasive logic of turn-of-the-century American capitalism and its protean appropriation of established gender and social roles by proposing an alternative modernity based upon queer resistance."

Therefore, these discussions are a link between traditional poetry and modern poetry, but their discussion is also a prayer. This is why it is difficult to say that the pursuit of ethnicity is pre-modern.In the process of modern poetry formation, the boundary between poetry(詩) and poetry(詩歌) was also created.

한국 여성 미(美)의 역사,2017,"['한국 여성', '미', '시대적 변화', '신체 자본']",본고는 한국 여성의 미가 시대적으로 어떤 변화의 과정을 거쳤는지를 정리하는 것이 목적이다. 우리나라의 경우 선사시대부터 이미 돼지기름을 통해 피부를 윤택하게하거나 눈썹을 그리거나 하는 흔적이 있는 것으로 보아 여성의 아름다움에 대한 추구의 역사는 매우 길다. 고구려 고분 벽화에서 발견된 여성의 그림에서 여성의 아름다움은 다소 통통한 후육미에서 날씬한 몸매와 날렵한 선의 얼굴로 변해 갔음을 알 수 있다. 고려시대 여성은 붉은 화장을 자제했으며 옅은 화장을 선호하였는데 이는 송나라의 영향으로 보인다. 조선시대는 외모의 화려함 보다는 가부장적 유교가 요구하는 품행이 단정한 여성이 아름다운 것으로 치부되었다. 일제 강점기의 근대적 여성은 점차 서구의 여성이미지를 이상화하는 모습을 보이며 얼굴과 더불어 신체 전체의 아름다움에 대한 관심도 높아졌다. 해방이후 미국식 대중문화의 영향으로 서구 여성을 이상적 미의 상징으로 여기는 경향이 더욱 심해졌다. 1990년대 이후 전지구적 영상시대를 살아가게 된 한국여성은 미디어를 통해 유통되는 서구 여성의 이미지를 미의 전형으로 여기며 성형과 몸 단련을 통해서 자신의 신체자본을 축적해가는 모습을 보인다.이런 자기의 테크놀로지 과정이 육체의 변형을 통한 새로운 정체성의 확립인지 자기 자신으로부터 소외되는 현상인지에 대해서 심층적인 고찰과 분석이 요구된다.,"The purpose of this paper is to historically trace down Korean women’s beauty.In the pre-historic era, there were signs that ancient people used pig oil to soften their skin and drew their eyebrows thick. From the wall paintings of Goguryeo tombs, images of women became more slender in later period. Women in Goryeo Dynasty wore natural make-up, using less red color. This trend seemed influencedby Chinese Song Dynasty. During Chosun Dynasty which took Confucianism as ruling doctrine, women’s physical beauty was thought to cause trouble. Women’s beauty was evaluated through their physical attractiveness as well as their prudent behavior. During Japanese occupation, Koreans were modernized andexposed to the western culture. Koreans began to idealize the western women’s beauty. This tendency to adore the western standard of beauty had been more intensified after the Korean War with the rapid influx of American popular culture. At the end of the twentieth century when the world has become borderless through exploding transnational visual media, Korean women try to be like western super models. To achieve their goal, they even go under the knife and do excruciating physical training. All these efforts are a way to accumulate corporal capital. It is rather necessary to critically contemplate whether this technology of self is a way to build a new identity though transforming the body or a self-alienating phenomenon."

However, these strategies were not always successful in driving innovative activities that make technology innovation disseminated. In this regard, innovation ecosystems approach has recently been coming to the force to establish a successful innovation strategy. The innovation ecosystems concept describes that innovation processes are evolved through collaborative networks of economic actors. In an innovation ecosystem, different organizations collaborate for technology development and its use. They interact for value co-creation by sharing mutual resources. The organizational networks are re-organized by dynamic changes of actors’ interactions, which drive innovation mechanism of the networks.  Recent studies on innovation ecosystems mostly have paid attention on developing theoretical frameworks to describe dynamics of an innovation ecosystem. There have hardly been empirical tests on the theoretical ecosystem models. In this vein, we investigated dynamics of an innovation ecosystem by analyzing structural characteristics of a collaborative network among organizations which are involved in the use of innovative technologies. Particularly, we examined the longitudinal changes of the interaction patterns among the organizations. This test was performed by an analysis of structural equivalence on the network dataset transformed from the organizational interactions. This result provides a guideline for an organization in developing an innovation strategy under a systemic perspective."
"공예의 형식 설계, 견양(見樣)",2017,"['견양(見樣)(Gyeon-yang)', '공예도안(craft drawing)', '도면(design)', '공예설계(craft design)']","조선왕실의 행사용 공예품은 의례나 이념적 규범에 따라 화원이 그린 견양(見樣)과 도상을 참작하여 장인들이 국가의 관리를 받으면서 제작하였다. 의궤는 국가 행사의 전모에 대한 세밀한 기록문서이지만 사실상 행사의 논의 과정이나 행례 자체에 관한 것 보다는 행사에 필요한 주요 물품을 준비하고 제작하는 과정에 대해 많은 부분을 할애하고 있다. 행사에 소용되는 각종 물품을 그림으로 기록하여 견양으로 참작하였다. 조선시대 영건도감 의궤에서 표현된 도설(圖說)들은 견양으로서 제작하였을 관련성을 제기한다.견양(見樣)은 근대 도안이 나타나기 이전 개념으로 오늘날 사전적 정의로서 건물의 설계도면이나 일정한 물건에 겨누어 정한 치수와 양식(樣式), 즉 견본(見本)을 의미한다. ‘겨냥’의 취음(取音)으로 일정한 목적물을 겨누는 일, 즉 본을 뜨는 행위를 가리키기도 한다.근대도안은 식산흥업정책을 구현하는 데 가장 중요한 요체로서 1880년대 이후부터 시도되었다. 도안은 대량생산 체제의 필수 요소로서 공예의 근대적 변모를 가늠하는 중요한 요건이 됨은 물론, 설계와 제작이 분리되는 산업디자인의 시원이 된다는 점에서도 의미가 각별하다. 도안의 탄생은 제작 시스템의 전환과 국가적 통제의 필요성이라는 두 가지 요인에 따른 결과였다. 공예가의 손을 떠나 기계로 옮아간 제작현장에서 도안은 제작의도를 정확하게 전달하는 의사소통 기능을 담당하게 되었다.도안 형태를 평면화해 펼친 그림의 형태로 규격과 문양, 단면 등을 표시하는 도면은 서양 근대과학의 발명품이었다. 근대 도면이 등장하기 이전의 공예품 도안은, ‘견양(見樣)’이라 하여 입체 모형을 만들거나 혹은 그림을 그려두고 제작하는 방식이 동아시아 전반에서 애용되었다. 조선시대 관요(官窯)에서는 견본용 도자기를 ‘견양’이라 하여 미리 견본을 만든 뒤에 이를 기준 삼아 제작하였다.조선의 경공장 체제에서 공예는 중앙으로부터 각 지방관부에 전달된 실물견본과 혹은 그림 두 종류의 견양을 기준으로 동일한 규격으로 제작된다. 정세한 품질기준, 형식의 정형화, 엄격성이 중시된 왕실 공예품에 의해 견양이 제작되었으며 규격화된 공예품의 제작규범이 형성되었던 것으로 보인다. 국가의 정책지표나 지배이념과 사상에 영향을 받으면서 정밀한 기준에 부합하는 공예품을 완성하기에 앞서 평면형 도화체제, 실물대 모형 및 축소 모형의 견양을 미리 제작하였다. 견양이라고 하는 견본품을 미리 제작하여 통일된 공예품을 정밀한 제작규범에 맞추어 제작한 것이다. 조선 관청수공업에 제작규범에 따라 수급된 견양은 형태를 평면화해 펼친 그림의 형태로 규격과 문양, 단면 등을 표시하는 근대 도면으로 이양된다.","The modern drawing, which is the most important factor to implement the policy for the industrial growth, has been attempted since the 1880s. Drawing is highly significant not only because it is a requirement to understand the modern transformation of craft as an essential element of mass production system, but also because it marked a starting point of industrial design where design and production are separated.The birth of modern design was the result of two factors: the conversion of the production system and the necessity of national control. At the production site in which hands of craftsmen were replaced by machines, drawing became responsible for the communicative function of accurately conveying the production intent.The modern drawing showing the standard, pattern, and section in the form of figure flattened out was the invention of Western modern science. Prior to its emergence, craftwork drawing was called 'Gyeon-yang'. Throughout East Asia, craftsmen usually created stereoscopic models or drawings for products. In Gwan-yo of the Joseon Dynasty period, ceramics for sampling were called 'Gyeon-yang', and craftsmen made such prototype in advance and then made their products in earnest.'Gyeon-yang' is a concept before the appearance of modern drawing. According to recent dictionary definition, it refers to sample, in other words, a construction design of a building or a measurement and form for a specific object. In addition, it also implies an act of ‘imitating’, 'aiming at a certain target', as a borrowing-sound of ‘Gyeon-yang’.In the light-manufacturing system in the Joseon Dynasty, crafts were produced on the same standard, based on the actual samples sent to each local branch from the central government, or two types of Gyeon-yang drawings. This study examines the use of Gyeon-yang according to the type of supply and demand of government officials by classifying it into a planar drawing system, a full scale model, and a reduced scale model. Moreover, this study attempts to closely investigate the design of crafts prior to the birth of modern drawing by exploring an artisan regarded as the maker of Gyeon-yang."

After 37 years of construction of the main hall and social education hall, the interior and exterior of the building were aged and required renovations. This paper describes a plan to maximize use of the interior space by renovation management for the 100th anniversary of the chapel (main hall and social education hall) and the space revitalization program studying the actual composition for various church events. (Method) Spatial planning for the main hall and social education center was organized with five goals in mind: First, to set the direction of spatial planning for Chungdong First Methodist Church through the reparation of a new temple. Second, to analyze the distribution and spatial needs of the functioning saints, we create a variable space suitable for the program. Third, the space transforms from worship center to educational, friendship, mission, and service center. Fourth, to secure and plan a cafe area as a place of communion place in the church space as a community center. Fifth, the study was initiated to accommodate space planning related to the change to the open church. (Results) The purpose of this study is to explore the entire religious belief concept of Jeongdong First Church, and to utilize space planning and unit space for each function of each room in the composition. In this study, variable space is planned for use in various functions. The main building's finishing material was designed to preserve the architectural heritage of red brick as much as possible. Shapes and finishes are also planned for each room, as well as major renovation of electrical and facility facilities. Architectural assets have been preserved with consideration of the present and future as it affects the direction and value of the interior space. The Appenzeller exhibition hall and cafe is planned for the first floor as an open space. (Conclusions) Religious spaces are changing with the mission of the times and should be planned as places where the saints of various ages come together to communicate harmony across the generations, spatial planning for different age groups, and the message of faith associated with a place of worship. The study is expected to be used as a guideline for church space design by presenting directions for present and future worship space planning, using the renovation case of Chungdong First Methodist Church, Korea 's first Protestant church, as a model."

Also, mediating effect of organizational justice has been verified through mediation analysis between transformational leadership and subjective career success. Organizational justice can be divided into three closely related but conceptually and statistically discrete dimensions. They are distributed justice, procedural justice and interactional justice. For these three types organizational justice, many studies support similar but different influences on many organizational variables. Accordingly, this study investigated each mediating effect of these three dimensions between transformational leadership and subjective career success. Based on literature review about the variables in the research model, hypotheses were derived as followings: H1. Transformational leadership will positively affect subjective career success.H2. Transformational leadership will positively affect organizational justice.H2-1. Transformational leadership will positively affect distributive justice.H2-2. Transformational leadership will positively affect procedural justice.H2-3. Transformational leadership will positively affect interactional justice.H3.

Procedural justice will positively affect subjective career success.H3-3. Interactional justice will positively affect subjective career success.H4. Organizational justice will mediate the effect from transformational leadership to subjective career success.H4-1. Distributive justice will mediate the effect from transformational leadership to subjective career success.H4-2. Procedural justice will mediate the effect from transformational leadership to subjective career success.H4-3. Interactional justice will mediate the effect from transformational leadership to subjective career success.The data was collected by web-based survey from employees who are with several Korean companies located in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do province. The analysis showed positive significant correlation among transformational leadership, subjective career success, distributed justice, procedural justice and interactional justice. Mediation analysis supported significant mediating effects for distributive and procedural justice. For interactional justice, however, mediating effect was just marginally (p < .10) supported by Sobel Test and rejected by Bootstrapping Test. For the purpose of pursuing more robust research, mediating effect of interactional justice was rejected.

Normalization/SRV has been credited with achieving considerable favourable change in learning disability services and thus in the lives of people with learning difficulties themselves over a number of years.But In many ways, it is capitalism that oppresses disabled people. So it was not so much Normalization that helped bring about the closures of the institutions but that capitalism was in crisis and it made more sense monetarily to stop housing people in large institution and to allow them to live in the community. Normalization underpins the interactionist and functionist theories has not far greater transformative potential in eradicating the oppression that disabled people face throughout the world. Furthermore Normalization, which is, at best, a bystander to remove the chains of that oppression and, at worst, part of the process of oppression itself.On the other hand, the Social Model of Disability, although enthusiastically embraced by many people with physical and sensory impairments, has been less readily adopted by learning disability services. In addition, within the literature the Social Model has been subject to criticism because of its failure to account fully for the experiences of some disabled people, including those with learning difficulties. In conclusion, “The Social Model neglects individual experiences of impairment for persons with learning difficulties.”So I have subsided this proposition identified by Oriental Paradigms as follows: First, the Social Model neglects for persons with learning difficulties.

In order for regressing the relationship between the yearly continental container port traffic in each four continent(EU, Asia, North America, and the other continent(South America+Africa)) and yearly world GDP, we performed the Log-Transformed GLS regression and Fixed Effects Model regression. Also we did the Granger Causality Test before performing the Fixed Effects Model regression in order to find the order relationship. This study could find one kind of order relationship : the increase of container port traffic happens precedently, and the world GDP increases subsequently. By applying the Hausman and LR tests, we could find that the fixed effects model is econometrically more meaningful than the random effects model for this study. The primary result of this study in the fixed effects model is that the coefficients of  the container port traffic in every four continent,” show a positive (+) impact on the dependent variable, the world GDP, even though four coefficients show different size of impact on world GDP respectively. The coefficients of the container traffic in EU continent and in Asia Continent show that the world GDP will increase by 0.72% and 1.27% if the container volume in each continent increase by 1%. In addition, we could investigate that if the coefficients of the container traffic in North America continent and in the other continentby 1.0%, the world GDP will increase by 1.18% and 2.43% respectively. Therefore, this study can conclude that the World find it appropriate to invest in container related port SOC especially in South America or Africa including many emerging economies, for more rapid world GDP’s development."

For this, research question is established as follows. How structural relations are going on among principals' transformational leadership, school’s creative organizational climate and teachers' creative teaching behavior? Through structure equation modeling, there are some findings whether schools' creative environment factors do mediating role in making relationship of school principals' transformational leadership and schools' creative organization climate. This study indicates the result as follows.First, school principals' transformational leadership has a positive effect to construct schools' creative environment of the organization. So, this study suggests that schools' creative organization climate can be well constructed based on the level of principals' transformational leadership. Second, schools' creative organizational climate has a positive effect of teachers' creative teaching behavior. Teachers' creative teaching behavior is rated higher when there are many organizational climate factors promoting creativity, in other words, less hindering factors. Third, the relationship between principals' transformational leadership and teachers' creative teaching behavior is fully mediated by schools' creative organizational climate. This means that principals' transformational leadership is having great impact to teachers' creative teaching behavior with schools' creative organizational climate. Therefore, this study addresses that, for revitalizing teachers' creative teaching behavior, the role of principal which can make schools' creative organizational climate more appropriate to revitalize teachers' creative teaching behavior has to be handled more importantly than principals' transformational leadership itself."

A personalized text-to-speech(TTS) system can be implemented by combining a speech synthesis system and a voice transformation system, and it is widely used in many application areas. It is known that the fundamental frequency and the spectral envelope of speech signal can be independently modified to convert the voice characteristics. Also it is important to maintain naturalness of the transformed speech. In this paper, a speech synthesis system based on Hidden Markov Model(HMM-based speech synthesis, HTS) using the STRAIGHT vocoder is constructed and voice transformation is conducted by modifying the fundamental frequency and spectral envelope. The fundamental frequency is transformed in a scaling method, and the spectral envelope is transformed through frequency warping method to control the speaker’s vocal tract length. In particular, this study proposes a voice transformation method using the correlation between fundamental frequency and vocal tract length. Subjective evaluations were conducted to assess preference and mean opinion scores(MOS) for naturalness of synthetic speech. Experimental results showed that the proposed voice transformation method achieved higher preference than baseline systems while maintaining the naturalness of the speech quality."

The solid suspending particles originating from the process of installation and operation of converter transformer have significant influence on the insulation performance of transformer oil, especially in presence of DC component in applied voltage. Under high electric field, the particles easily lead to partial discharge and breakdown of insulating oil. This paper investigated copper particle effect on the breakdown voltage of transformer oil at combined AC and DC voltage. A simulation model with single copper particle was established to interpret the particle effect on the breakdown strength of insulating oil. The experimental and simulation results showed that the particles distort the electric field. The breakdown voltage of insulating oil contaminated with copper particle decreases with the increase of particle number, and the breakdown voltage and the logarithm of particle number approximately satisfy the linear relationship. With the increase of the DC component in applied voltage, the breakdown voltage of contaminated insulating oil decreases. The simulation results show that the particle collides with the electrode more frequently with more DC component contained in the applied voltage, which will trigger more discharge and decrease the breakdown voltage of insulating oil."

During the nation-building period after the liberation from Japan, North Korea established its higher education system with the assistance of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's strong influence on the higher education system of North Korea can be explained by the two factors, including the Soviet Union's interest to expand its long-term political power in the Korean peninsula during the Cold War, and North Korea's emergent need to stabilize its society, especially in competition with South Korea. During the 1940s, North Korea adopted the Soviet type university model to a large extent, but the Soviet Union's influence began to be diminished from mid-1950s, when Kim Il Sung strengthened his political grip in North Korean domestic politics. After mid-1950s, North Korea's socialist education model, based on Marxism-Leninism, began to be replaced with its unique educational ideology, called Juche Sasang. However, this change focused on the contents of the education, not the structure. Consequently, the higher education system of North Korea began to turn away from embracing diversity in academic thoughts and ideologies in its curricula, and became more ideologically oriented and resistant to external influence including that of the Soviet Union."

a perceptually-adaptive high-capacity color image watermarking system,2017,"['Color image watermarking', 'spatio-chromatic Fourier transform', 'perceptual models', 'data hiding capacity']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Robust and perceptually-adaptive image watermarking algorithms have mainly targeted gray-scale images either at the modeling or embedding levels despite the widespread availability of color images. Only few of the existing algorithms are specifically designed for color images where color correlation and perception are constructively exploited. In this paper, a new perceptual and high-capacity color image watermarking solution is proposed based on the extension of Tsui et al. algorithm. The CIEL*a*b* space and the spatio-chromatic Fourier transform (SCFT) are combined along with a perceptual model to hide watermarks in color images where the embedding process reconciles between the conflicting requirements of digital watermarking. The perceptual model, based on an emerging color image model, exploits the non-uniform just-noticeable color difference (NUJNCD) thresholds of the CIEL*a*b* space. Also, spread-spectrum techniques and semi-random low-density parity check codes (SR-LDPC) are used to boost the watermark robustness and capacity. Unlike, existing color-based models, the data hiding capacity of our scheme relies on a game-theoretic model where upper bounds for watermark embedding are derived. Finally, the proposed watermarking solution outperforms existing color-based watermarking schemes in terms of robustness to standard image/color attacks, hiding capacity and imperceptibility."
numerical analysis on transient behaviors of slag layer in an entrained-flow coal gasifier,2017,"['Ash deposition', 'Coal gasification', 'Entrained gasifier', 'Numerical model', 'Slag layer']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>In an entrained-flow coal gasifier with water-cooled walls, it is important to maintain an appropriate range of slag thickness on the wall for protecting the refractory and preventing blockage at the slag tap. Owing to the difficulty in measurement within the gasifier, the heat absorption on the wall and downstream syngas composition are monitored as indicators of slag thickness and gas temperature. However, there is a certain delay between these parameters that can be highlighted by the dynamic modeling of slag behaviors on the wall and reactions/flow in the gas regime. In this study, a new dynamic model for the slag layer was developed, which solves for the energy, heat transfer, and flow of the solid and liquid slag layers including the transformation between the two phases. The model was applied to a commercial gasifier varying operating parameters, and the transient behaviors of the slag layers were analyzed focusing on the thickness at the slag tap and the heat absorption on the wall. When the operating conditions changed abruptly, the slag layer required 10min or longer to reach the new steady state. The thinning of the slag layer was faster than its thickening. In addition, the response of heat absorption was significantly faster than that for the slag thickness at the slag tap. The characteristic times of the slag layer were shorter with changes in gas temperature than with changes in the mass rate and temperature of the slag deposition. During the transient states, the temperature profile within the liquid slag became non-linear, which suggests that existing models assuming a linear temperature profile may not be appropriate for dynamic simulations.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  A new dynamic model for slag layer on the wall of a coal gasifier is proposed. </LI> <LI>  The slag layer requires 10min or longer to adjust to new operating conditions. </LI> <LI>  The heat absorption on the wall responds faster than the slag thickness. </LI> <LI>  Gas temperature changes the slag layer faster than slag deposition rate. </LI> <LI>  The temperature profile of liquid slag can be non-linear during transient states. </LI> </UL> </P>"

novel adaptive blanking regulation scheme for constant current and constant voltage primary-side controlled flyback converter,2017,"['Adaptive blanking time', 'Primary-side regulation', 'Transformer leakage inductance']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Primary-side regulation (PSR) scheme is widely applied in low power applications, such as cell phone chargers, network adapters, and LED drivers. However, the efficiency and standby power requirements have been improved to a high standard due to the new trends of DOE (Department Of Energy) Level VI and COC (Code Of Conduct specifications) V5. The major drawbacks of PSR include poor regulation due to inaccurate feedback and difficulty in acquiring acceptable regulation. A novel adaptive blanking strategy for constant current and constant voltage regulation is proposed in this paper. An accurate model for the sample blanking time related to transformer leakage inductance and the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) parasitic capacitance is established. The proposed strategy can achieve accurate detection for ultra-low standby power. In addition, numerous control factors are analyzed in detail to eliminate the influence of leakage inductance on the loop stability. A dedicated controller integrated circuit (IC) with a power MOSFET is fabricated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. Experimental results demonstrated that the prototype based on the proposed IC has excellent performance."

from cotton kimonos to the jeans industry: the development of denim industrial clusters in japan,2017,"['small weaving manufacturer', 'cotton kimono businesses', 'clothing', 'jeans', 'Japan']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This study examines how small weaving manufacturers in Japan managed to successfully transform their cotton kimono businesses during the phenomenon of the growing popularity of Western clothing in the 1970s, and develop within the Sanbi industrial cluster to become global leaders in the production of high-quality denim and jeans worldwide.IntroductionJapanese denim companies are very small but remain competitive due to their quality, compared with Chinese, Mexican, and Turkish companies. Some of these Japanese companies have won the Premier Vision Fabrics Handle Prize, while others have created new denim fabrics, such as soft denim, for luxury brands. According to the data of the Office of Textile and Apparel (OTEXA), as a proportion of sales in 2015 the United States imported most of its blue denim fabric from Japan (28.9 percent), with China in second place (26.2 percent), and Mexico third (17.3 percent); in terms of volume, the United States imported blue denim fabric from China (36.3 percent), with Mexico in second place (24.8 percent), and Japan third (13.5 percent). How was it that Japanese denim companies developed to become such prominent leaders in the field? Most of these companies are clustered geographically, with jeans companies sitting side-by-side with dyeing, processing, and finishing factories. These clusters were originally set up for the production of Kasuri cotton kimono clusters, and only shifted into denim and jeans production in the 1970s. This study will shed light on the development process of the denim industry in Japan – focusing on the Sanbi district, the largest denim and jeans cluster – and will examine the success factors in the global market from a historical perspective using primary sources.The Westernization of ClothingOne success factor is the social and culture background in Japan (Fujioka and Wubs, forthcoming). Before the Second World War most people in Japan – male and female, old and young – wore kimonos. A kimono is a traditional Japanese robe that is tied at the waist by a wide belt called an ‘obi’. It has no buttons, zippers, or any other kinds of fastening. The shape of the garment is very simple and it has little decoration. A kimono is made from many different types of fabric, including silk, cotton, wool, and linen. The type of fabric defined the kimono’s suitability for different occasions, such as a high-quality silk kimono for ceremonial events and a cotton one for casual wear. The type of fabric also reflected a person’s social position, until the Meiji Restoration in 1868. During this time only the Samurai class could wear silk kimonos, while other social classes wore cotton kimonos. After 1868 people had freedom of choice in clothing, meaning that anyone could wear silk kimonos for weddings and funerals.Although Western-style clothing had already been introduced to the upper classes by the Japanese government during the Meiji Restoration, after the Second World War, the Japanese lifestyle began to be westernized at an ever-faster pace, particularly in the area of clothing. Along with the high economic growth in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the kimono market shrank and Western fashion became a mass phenomenon in Japan. First came tailor-made clothes for upper-class and upper-middle-class customers; after this, clothing companies rapidly increased their sales, and ready-to-wear clothing soon became common among every generation and income group in the 1970s. Jeans were one example of the clothing that was introduced at this time, and a niche market formed of mainly young customers who lived in urban areas. These young consumers had first seen jeans being worn by Americans from the General Headquarters (GHQ) during the recovery period, and they soon began to identify jeans as a symbol of freedom and individuality. With the increasing demand for jeans, several jeans and denim companies were established in the 1970s to capture this niche market. Since then the denim and jeans market in Japan has developed to specialize in high-quality premium denim and jeans.The Sanbi Industrial ClusterThe main factor in the success of the Japanese denim and jeans industry is the effective transformation of the whole cluster. Cotton kimonos have a variety of styles based on various dyeing and weaving methods. The ‘Kasuri’ kimono, for example, is a type of cotton kimono that is dyed with indigo, requiring great skill in dyeing and weaving; as a result, it can be very expensive, although this type of cotton kimono is still regarded as casual, everyday clothing. There were three main industrial clusters for Kasuri kimonos in Japan, namely Kurume, Iyo, and Bingo, which had been established in around 1800. Among these, Bingo became the largest cluster and produced more mass products than the others in the 1960s. While Kurume and Iyo were striving to innovate a new Kasuri fabric and shifted to the high-end market to cover the decreasing demands of kimonos, the Bingo cluster created mass products more efficiently than before. It continued to increase its sales until 1960 with the improvement of technology, although in the 1970s sales began to decrease rapidly with the huge growth in demand for Western clothing (Shinichi Choshi Hensan Iinkai, 2002).Many manufacturers therefore suffered from the introduction of the new Western clothing. Some silk kimono manufacturers were able to shift their focus to the high-end market for ceremonial occasions due to their special place in Japanese society (Hashino, 2015). However, many cotton kimono manufacturers, particularly those in the Bingo cluster who focused on mass customers, were unable to do so, because of the shrinking casual kimono market. This industrial cluster was therefore forced by changing consumer demands to transform the whole nature of its business from the production of traditional cotton Kasuri kimonos to a brand new industry.The neighboring clusters of Bingo are Bizen and Bicchu, which were also cotton kimono clusters that used Kasuri fabric. Some manufacturers in Bizen who made kimono accessories started to produce ‘tabi’ (Japanese-style socks) in 1877 and then began sewing Western-style work clothes in the 1910s. In the 1920s many manufactures in the Bizen cluster started to produce Western-style school uniforms, which became increasingly popular (Fujii et al., 2007). This was a natural transition in terms of finding different uses for the same relevant technology: from the production of cotton fabric to tabi, and from tabi to school uniforms. All these products were made for daily use, and the same cutting and sewing skills for thick textiles that were used to make tabi were directly transferable to the production of work uniforms and school uniforms; by 1937 the Bizen cluster had become the largest producer of school uniforms in Japan.However, between 1965 and 1970 the demand for school uniforms fell, because the early generation of baby boomers had passed through school, and competition within each cluster became more intensive with the emergence of newcomers. In order to manage the distribution channel and build a stable production system, large cotton-spinning companies controlled the weaving mills and sewing factories and organized retailers to maintain retail prices. This was a well-known form of management in Japan at the time called ‘Keiretsu’. As a result, those manufacturers who were not working in partnership with any large spinning manufacturers found it very difficult to secure orders, and were eventually pushed out of the industry and forced to change the nature of their business. One of these small manufacturers in Bizen was called Big John, which had been established in 1940 to produce school uniforms. After transforming its business, it started to sew the first ‘made in Japan’ jeans using imported American denim in 1967, and later using Japanese denim in 1972 (Sugiyama, 2009). Its great success encouraged many of its surrounding manufacturers to join this emerging field, which resulted in the establishment of a whole new denim and jeans industry that spread across Bizen, Bingo, and Bicchu to the point where these three districts became collectively known as ‘Sanbi’ in Japanese.The Successful Transformation of Industrial ClustersNew technology for producing denim and jeans was brought to Japan from the United States. Many denim companies started out as producers of Kasuri fabric and shifted to denim production in the 1960s and 1970s, using their existing skills and technology to make this transition. Although it was a natural path to take considering the change in consumer demand and the fact that both Kasuri fabric and jeans were dyed by indigo, there were many challenges involved in adapting to this change. Rope dyeing was the biggest hurdle that these manufacturers had to face, but they managed to learn the technique by reverse engineering American-made jeans and relying on their skills in indigo dyeing and sewing thick textiles. Making a success of this transition from a cotton kimono cluster into a denim and jeans cluster was the only way that these businesses could survive the huge growth in popularity of Western clothing in Japan. This whole transformational process was led by small, lesser-known manufacturers rather than by larger ones. As one of the major businesses in the Kasuri cluster in Japan, Bingo catered for the mass market, but was hardest hit by the introduction of Western clothing, as it was more difficult for its business model to adjust to westernization. Bizen, however, managed to shift to the production of Western clothing at an early stage, focusing on uniforms – and it was the dropout factories from the uniform industry that eventually became the driving force behind the emergence of the jeans industry. The resulting success of the Japanese denim business model then spread out across the cluster, which today enjoys an enhanced competitive advantage in the global market."

The selected hull form was scaled model of a passenger ship provided by the Ship Stability Research Center at the University of Strathclyde, UK. A damaged compartment was located amidships. Computed ship motions in head and following seas in regular wave train were analyzed by fast Fourier transform and the computation results of the pitch, heave, and roll motions and the advance speed were compared with experimental data in the same test condition. The pitch and heave motions by the numerical analysis agreed well with the experimental results, but the computation overpredicted roll motions at the natural roll frequency. In head seas conditions, the advance speed was overpredicted, regardless of the wave amplitude and period. In addition, flow behavior around the course-keeping model was investigated, in terms of the free-surface wave, hull wake, and flooding behavior."

Structure equation modeling analysis were conducted. Based on these procedures, the findings of this study are as follows. Following analysis upon direct/indirect effect among principal’s transformational leadership, vice-principal’s transformational leadership, teacher leadership and teacher’s commitment, principal’s transformational leadership did not cause significant effect on teacher’s commitment, while it had significant indirect effect on teacher’s commitment through a medium of teacher leadership. Vice-principal’s transformational leadership had significant effects on teacher leadership and teacher’s commitment, and it had more effects on teacher’s commitment through a medium of teacher leadership. The result shows that vice-principals’ role and their influences are growing in school as a role of the school increasing in community. It also suggests for teachers to have teacher leadership to enhance teacher’s commitment by having vision of educational objectives autonomically. Therefore, to increase teacher leadership, principal and vice-principal as a school administrator need to exercise their leadership to enlarge intramural teacher’s training opportunities and support them to enhance teacher’s professionalism."

For the purpose of providing meaningful interpretation on “the living human texts” situated in complex contexts and meeting their fundamental needs of existence, importance of conversation with other academic domains is more and more elevated in practical theology. While engaging in rational communication with other academic fields, practical theologians need to attentively articulate the models and methods of cross disciplinary dialogue. In this article, we will review four types of traditional approaches to the relationship between theology and science, and then three models of cross-disciplinary dialogue: correlational, transformational, and transversal."

Under the critical mind about what direction the culture reading education in university in this state should be aiming at and what text and how we should educate, this paper focused on the sino-Korean prose works.All the sino-Korean prose works, such as nonsul-ryu (論說類), seobal-ryu (序跋類), seogan-ryu (書簡類), juui-ryu (奏議類), etc., are the texts that fulfilled a certain role and functions in the contemporary political, social, and cultural contexts and accurately reflected the contemporary social aspect, which have a high value as the cultural education material in that we could grasp the contemporary environment and context, interpret the text based on this, and induce an active and critical reading training deriving the reverse meanings which functioned actually in contemporary reality.In this paper, the cultural reading class model was suggested by using 「Sa-ho-jo-cham-ui-so (辭戶曹參議疏)」, an appealing text of Kim Chang-hyeop as the materials. First of all, in order to analyze 「Sa-ho-jo-cham-ui-so」 considering the stylistic traits of an appealing text and a preface and the background and context for each work, the text was precisely analyzed and based on this, the cultural reading class model was presented in which the two texts were adopted as a material.Through this, we could examine whether or not the critical reading training to grasp the background, context, writing form, and structure of the texts and to actively apply this to the analysis, would be possible when utilizing the sino-Korean prose works as the material of cultural reading class. In addition, we established that such class model could be the opportunity to awake the essence of cultural reading education in university which could foster the critical intellect which would not be swept by the printing types overflowing in all areas, including the modern politics, society, and press, as well as classics."

We also analyze the leadership mechanism and the influence of effective environment by using team climate as a mediator and using adhocracy and hierarchy organizational culture as moderator.  Data were collected through surveys of Korean Public Research Institutes conducting mainly basic science and applied sciences. 327 valid samples were tested using a structural equation model (SEM).  Empirical results confirm that transactional leadership exhibits stronger direct effect on the creativity than transformational leadership. However, in indirect effects mediated by creative team climate, transformational leadership is found to be stronger than transactional leadership. It may reflect the characteristics of R&D organization.  Also, through the verification of the moderating effect of the organizational culture, the adhocracy organizational culture appears to improve the creativity and the hierarchical organizational culture appears to inhibit the creativity. It is confirmed that the influence of organizational culture is statistically significant in R&D organizations with strong autonomy and independence.  It is suggested that the leadership on the creativity of the members in the R&D organization may be indirect in the context of the team and the organization as well as the direct effects according to the type."

The IEC 61850 is a global standard which proposes efficient substation automation by defining interoperable communication and data modelling techniques. In order to achieve this level of interoperability and automation, the IEC 61850 (Part 6) defines System Configuration description Language (SCL). The SCL is an XML based file format for defining the abstract model of primary and secondary substation equipment, communications systems and also the relationship between them. It enables the interoperable exchange of data during substation engineering by standardizing the description of applications at different stages of the engineering process. To achieve the seamless interoperability, multi-vendor devices are required to adhere completely to the IEC 61850. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm required for verifying the interoperability of multi-vendor devices by checking the adherence of the SCL file to specifications of the standard. Our proposed SCL validation algorithm consists of schema validation and other functionalities including information model validation using UML data model, the Vendor Defined Extension model validation, the User Defined Rule validation and the IED Engineering Table (IET) consistency validation. It also integrates the standard UCAIUG (Utility Communication Architecture International Users Group) Procedure validation for quality assurance testing. Our proposed algorithm is not only flexible and efficient in terms of ensuring interoperable functionality of tested devices, it is also convenient for use by system integrators and test engineers."

Existing studies on the Korean economic development model not only have a weak point in understanding the characteristics of the Korean development model from a comparative perspective but also have limitations in explaining the changes since the late 1990s. This paper first maintains that the growth of the Korean economy has been able to be continued not through market competition like liberalist arguments, but through the continuous operation of the developmental state, and second, not through the persistence of past growth models as the claims of classical developmentalists, but through the changes of the Korean economic growth strategy. The Korean economy shifted its direction from the input-oriented growth strategy to the innovation-driven growth strategy. And the transformation of this growth strategy was not the result of private initiative adaptation but the result of policy implementation based on the developmental state’s ideational shift, not on the simple continuation of the state power or means."

More specifically, this work explores the “public” model of pastoral theology, which views personal issues for care in social-structural terms, including gender, race, class, disability, culture, politics, and economics. To achieve this goal, this paper attempts to engage in a constructive conversation of pastoral theology with public theology. It argues that the public model of pastoral care and counseling-public pastoral theology-is the pastoral theological approach that envisions a community of care which works to enhance the well-being of both the individual and the society. I mainly utilized North American literature with the inclusion of some Korean-American ideas to support my claims.Public pastoral theology has two important concerns: the public silence of mainstream Christianity on key social issues, and the limitations exhibited by the pastoral focus on the individual alone. Pastoral theology with a public concern endeavors to provide care for individual needs by analyzing social, political, and spiritual dimensions. It attempts to accomplish the common good and offers care that is more authentic for the individual and the community. While the clinical model of ministry emphasizes the individualistic care of people with psychological resources, the public model of pastoral theology has a renewed interest in cultural, social, contextual, and public dimensions of caregiving ministries, through which it provides transformative challenges to systems of power that violate and oppress individuals and communities.Public pastoral theology encourages a critical conversation with other disciplines, develops sound theories and practices, and influences other disciplines, offering cultural analysis in a concrete and practical way. It endeavors to transform our community and society, developing policy interpretation and public debate, public norms, and practical strategies for caring for individuals, cultures, and the natural.The theology of Andrew Sung Park, a renowned Korean-American theologian, provides a powerful theological and theoretical framework for the practice of public pastoral theology, emphasizing the public ethos of hahn, jung, and mut. Park suggests a practical program for a “new world order” to heal the pains of han. He articulates his vision of a global church in which “a community of economic democracy, of corporate social responsibility, and of corporative political power” is established. Park’s theology of mutual enhancement integrates the Eastern ideas of communalism with Western perspectives of individualism and thus provides an optimal millieu for the authentic community public pastoral theologians strive to create."

Based on the Stack Model, for the general understandings of IoT, we do keyword analyses on the academic papers whose major research issue is IoT. It is found that the current status of IoT application from the perspectives of cloud and big data analytics is not active, meaning that the real value of IoT has not been realized. We also examine the cases which deal with the part of cloud process which is crucial for value accrual. Based on these findings, we suggest the future direction of IoT research.

In particular, in order to reduce electric load and energy cost, sophisticated electric load forecasting and efficient smart grid operation strategy are required. In this paper, for more accurate electric load forecasting, we extend the data collected at demand time into high time resolution and construct an artificial neural network-based forecasting model appropriate for the high time resolution data. Furthermore, to improve the accuracy of electric load forecasting, time series data of sequence form are transformed into continuous data of two-dimensional space to solve that problem that machine learning methods cannot reflect the periodicity of time series data. In addition, to consider external factors such as temperature and humidity in accordance with the time resolution, we estimate their value at the time resolution using linear interpolation method. Finally, we apply the PCA(Principal Component Analysis) algorithm to the feature vector composed of external factors to remove data which have little correlation with the power data. Finally, we perform the evaluation of our model through 5-fold cross-validation. The results show that forecasting based on higher time resolution improve the accuracy and the best error rate of 3.71% was achieved at the 3-min resolution."

The mineralization model, the pH of the environment, and the deposition time were optimized. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images demonstrated that homogeneous and well-crystallized inorganic mineral layers were generated in the dynamic mineralization model system after incubating 3 h at pH 5.7.PV, which possesses the highest level of phosphorylation among egg proteins, was used as a model protein to investigate the contribution of PV in the mineralization process. The morphological structure and composition of the collagen/calcium phosphate composite nanofibers were also characterized by energy dispersive spectroscopy, scanning photoelectron spectrometer, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. XRD results showed the transformation process of mineralization materials from dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) to HA through the changes of characteristic peaks at approximately 11° of DCPD and 31.8° of HA. 1.0 mg/mL. Phosvitin significantly promoted the phase transformation from DCPD to hydroxyapatite. High performance liquid chromatography results indicated that PV induced the mineralization rather than being the part of the hydroxyapatite.The minerals formed on electrospun collagen nanofiber membranes were identified to be from hydroxyapatite.

reduction of multiscale stochastic biochemical reaction networks using exact moment derivation,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<▼1><P>Biochemical reaction networks (BRNs) in a cell frequently consist of reactions with disparate timescales. The stochastic simulations of such multiscale BRNs are prohibitively slow due to high computational cost for the simulations of fast reactions. One way to resolve this problem uses the fact that fast species regulated by fast reactions quickly equilibrate to their stationary distribution while slow species are unlikely to be changed. Thus, on a slow timescale, fast species can be replaced by their quasi-steady state (QSS): their stationary conditional expectation values for given slow species. As the QSS are determined solely by the state of slow species, such replacement leads to a reduced model, where fast species are eliminated. However, it is challenging to derive the QSS in the presence of nonlinear reactions. While various approximation schemes for the QSS have been developed, they often lead to considerable errors. Here, we propose two classes of multiscale BRNs which can be reduced by deriving an exact QSS rather than approximations. Specifically, if fast species constitute either a feedforward network or a complex balanced network, the reduced model based on the exact QSS can be derived. Such BRNs are frequently observed in a cell as the feedforward network is one of fundamental motifs of gene or protein regulatory networks. Furthermore, complex balanced networks also include various types of fast reversible bindings such as bindings between transcriptional factors and gene regulatory sites. The reduced models based on exact QSS, which can be calculated by the computational packages provided in this work, accurately approximate the slow scale dynamics of the original full model with much lower computational cost.</P></▼1><▼2><P><B>Author summary</B></P><P>Molecules inside a cell undergo various transformations via biochemical reactions with disparate rates. For instance, while transcriptional factors bind and unbind gene promoters in a time scale of seconds, mRNA transcription takes at least several minutes. For such systems regulated by both fast and slow reactions together, most of the computation time in stochastic simulations is spent on simulating the fast reactions, even if our interest is in the dynamics of slow reactions such as transcription. This problem can be resolved by deriving a reduced system, which can accurately approximate the slow dynamics of the original system without simulating fast reactions. However, when nonlinear reactions exist, the accurate reduction is often impossible. Here, we describe that two classes of nonlinear systems, both of which appear frequently as models of natural biochemical reaction networks, can be effectively reduced, and we provide a computational package to carry out the reduction. We find that the resulting reduced systems accurately capture the stochastic dynamics of the original system, while saving considerable simulation time.</P></▼2>"

In this paper, the 3D game is developed by applying the component method, which is the object creation method widely used in the commercial game engine, in the DirectX 11 environment. There are four kinds of components used in the in-house 3D game. These are four components such as transform, mesh, script, and collider. The component generation method used in this paper shows very good operation efficiency in terms of reusability. This paper also applied tangent space normal mapping to static and dynamic objects and analyzed performance at various screen resolutions. Performance analysis showed that the average rendering speed was 64.6% higher on the low resolution screen than on the high resolution screen. And the rendering speed of model G with normal mapping to all objects among the 8 simulation models is improved by 19.2% compared with model B without normal mapping. The presence or absence of normal mapping has the greatest effect on rendering speed."

It is important to establish a consumer-centered, participatory knowledge-based education system in terms of both analog and digital aspects so that students can be raised naturally and grow as local talents and live a lifetime if desired. If the active participation of the local government is institutionalized, it can also contribute to the grassroots democracy as a valuable means of realization of local living autonomy. It is desirable to establish what kind of educational autonomous organization or organization is appropriate in the course of program implementation or implementation experience. We will emphasize the transformation of the idea of approaching the formation of the organizational model, that is, the educational organization and organization structure after the pre - education program, with sufficient consideration of how to collaborate. The expansion plan of education autonomous model does not necessarily have to be uniform nationwide. It is possible to organize different organizations and institutions according to the region.

Given the fact that the distribution of excavated stone tools is result of deposition and constant transformation after human activities, each sedimentary layer and concentration of stone tools is set up as a unit of analysis. For the analysis, the artefacts were explored by the vertical location in a sedimentary layer, and the assemblage of the artefacts in each layer or distribution of a small size of artefacts was compared with sedimentary layers in time. The analysis shows transformation of the distribution and assemblage of the artefacts over time. In the sires date back to the Late Paleolithic, it is relatively more difficult to explore the culture because the more transformation happened. Not surprisingly, it demands to consider the causes of transformation more to reconstruct human behavior in the sites. This transformation can impact on a variety of analysis including charcoal, volcanic ash, pollen and etc. In addition, it should be paid attention that chemical transformation can be also caused depending on the site formation. It should be required the consistent research to make a model to study the Paleolithic data."
conceptualising brand charisma,2017,"['brand charisma', 'luxury', 'brand', 'brand experience', 'brand resonance']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The conceptualisation of brand charisma is multi-disciplinary, using luxury branding context. This research adds value by making significant contributions by extending and building theory; holds managerial implications for policymakers and brand managers in shaping and communicating brand charisma; additionally to develop a research framework and scale to measure brand charisma.IntroductionCharisma in grounded in anthropology and sociology; which has been divided into three key definitions. At the root of the sociological construct it is associated with a leader who generates extremes of loyalty and motivation among followers (Smothers 1993).The primary reason charisma is used, historically speaking, is to gain control over a group of people, and create a strong following (Weber 1946; Dow 1968; Smothers 1993). Research has demonstrated that charismatic leaders are more likely to effect and motivate individuals (followers) beyond expectations and command extremes of attachments (Bass 1985, 1988; Conger 1988; House et al 1988). This implies that charisma can inspire devotion to a leader that surpasses mere loyalty (Spencer 1973; Dow 1968); an irrational bond and inspiration between leader and follower (Marcus, 1961). As competition continues to grow within the luxury sector brand resonance is increasingly important as some of the effects include: higher loyalty to the brand, increased number of followers, ease to move consumers, development and diffusion of new products and greater consumer accommodation for the brand. In recent years, as brands try to become more ‘accessible’ to consumers and provide them with more brand experiences online we see the brand become diluted and evidence of brand fatigue set in (Business Insider 2015). Brand experience has been conceptualised as ‘sensations, feelings, cognitions, and behavioural responses evoked by brand related stimuli’ (Brakus et al 2009); which are often subjective and internal responses (Brakus et al 2009). Most experiences occur directly when consumers shop, buy, and consume products. Experiences can also occur indirectly—for example, when consumers are exposed to advertising and marketing communications, including Web sites. As a majority of luxury brand consumers are deemed to be loyal to the brand, it is important to capitalise on these followers (Levitt 1975) to further foster brand- follower- consumer engagement. Pastor et al (2007) were able to demonstrate that followers’ emotional responses have a significant influence on charismatic leaders; where followers experienced higher levels of arousal, they were more likely to rate leaders as charismatic.Brands can have charisma through social construction, compelling emotional associations that build on imagery, symbolism and prestige. Thus, it leads to extraordinary levels of motivation and attachment- achieving brand resonance. Thus, followers and consumers will view the brand as being sacred, and imbued with deeply significant and metaphorical meaning (Smothers 1993). It is evident that brand charisma allows the brand to exercise control and influence over a following or group of consumers. As brand charisma serves as a motivational tool to inspire and communicate their brand vision to followers, it allows the charisma to remain unique and rare (only for those in the community). While the ability to attain this brand charisma is always kept out of reach for everyday consumers, in order to motivate them to perform and engage with the brand beyond expectation. From the followers perspective, charisma is used to communicate or signal to others their social belonging and identity to a particular community.The presence therefore of brand charisma serves as a guide, or vision, of the brand that is aspirational and inspirational for the followers, with the promise of the ‘dream’ being attainable by belonging to this group. It is interesting, and pivotal to note that brand charisma is not like a normal brand- follower relationship, but rather a unique bond that is value laden, ongoing and influential on perceptions.Some key characteristics have been used in forming a conceptual definition of brand charisma, form both the brand and follower perspective. These include “exercise diffuse and intense influence over the beliefs, values, behaviour and performance of others through own behaviour and example” (Dow 1969; House et al 1991; Shils 1965); “unique connection between leader and follower that can account for extraordinary performance and accomplishments of individuals, work groups, units and organisations” (Yammarino et al 1992; Bensman and Givant; Conger and Kanungo 1998); “transcendent from the ordinary” ; “the process is both parallel and analogous process…both change meaning and perceived value” (Weber 1922; 1966; Levitt 1975; Smothers 1993).Drawing from the above emerging characteristics, which is reflective of the literature, a tentative conceptual definition of brand charisma has been proposed below:“The ability to articulate the brand vision, elicit a positive emotional response by its audience or followers that is characterised by extremes of motivational attachment”Through a content analysis of luxury brands and a rigorous literature review, has identified ‘core’ and ‘supplementary’ characteristics for the presence of brand charisma, which is aimed to be further explored. The Core characteristics of brand charisma can be thought of as the source of the brands charismatic aura and this must be present for charismatic brands; while the supplementary characteristics are not crucial or inherent to every charismatic brand.Research GapsBased on the extended literature review, the following key gaps have been identified:1. To the best of my knowledge there has been no conceptualisation of brand charisma in marketing and branding (e.g. Smothers 1993; Dion and Arnould 2011)a. Lack of working definition for brand charisma and lack of research framework and scale to measure brand charisma2. Diminutive studies have used the concept of charisma in luxury branding or marketing3. Assessing whether brand charisma should be implemented or is present across various ‘categories’ of luxury (e.g. inaccessible vs. affordableluxury)4. Past studies have not addressed the influence of brand charisma on consumer emotions and perceptions (e.g. Dion and Arnould 2011)Based on the above research gaps the following research questions have been developed:RQ1: What is brand charisma?RQ2: How does the presence of brand charisma influence brand resonance?RQ3: Does the presence of brand charisma differ between affordable and inaccessible luxury?RQ4: What are the emotional responses elicited by the presence of brand charisma?Theoretical Framework and Hypotheses DevelopmentStimulus- Organism- Response (S-O-R) model is the underpinning theoretical framework for the proposed research (Mehrabian and Russell 1974). The S-O-R model has been widely used in retail environment (e.g. Buckley 1991; Chang et al. 2011) and to study different types of involvement (Arora 1982). Based on the S-O-R model, the stimulus is defined as any external stimuli that influence the internal states of an individual which consist of both environmental influence and marketing mix variable (Bagozzi 1978; Eroglu et al. 2003). In this proposed research the presence of brand charisma will serve as the external stimuli that influence consumers’ perception of luxury and brand affect. The perception of luxury is affected by brand related stimuli and imagery (Brakus et al 2009), which include but not limited to, elements such as; brand name, products sold and communications. Organism is defined as the internal emotional response which influences the relationship between external stimuli and the behavioural response (Bagozzi 1978). In this study, perception of luxury and brand affect will serve as the internal consumer responses (sensations, feelings and cognitions) which is degree to which a consumer is effected via the environment, being either direct or indirect, through the 5 senses (sensory appeal). In this study, the resulting response will be brand resonance, as this extends beyond loyalty and encapsulates a brand follower or consumer to willingly and proactively engage in word of mouth, have deep attachment or connection with the brand, feel proud of association with this brand and community followers (Keller 2001).Supporting TheoryAs brand charisma is a set of activities to capture the distinctive brand essence, which creates a strong sensory appeal compelling consumers to strongly advocate for the brand; we see the transfer of charisma onto the brand through concepts such as brand experience (consumer touchpoints) and brand resonance (brand- follower relationships). Thus, the Law of Contagion is the underpinning theory to support the effects of brand charisma (Frazer 1959, Mauss 1972; Tylor 1974). The Law of Contagion for the proposed research focuses on sympathetic magic, namely the effects of contagion, which deem that whatever is done to a material object will affect equally the person with whom the object was once in contact, whether it formed part of his body or not (Frazer 1889). This can be extended to brand activities such as communications, Furthermore, Spillover Effects, is the secondary effectof brand charisma as we are assessing the ‘spillover’ of charisma onto the brand and the effects it will have on the proposed relationships (Simonin and Ruth 1998) between perception of luxury, brand affect and brand resonance.Charismatic Leadership Theory (Weber [1922] 1978) has been deemed ‘transformational’, ‘visionary’ or ‘inspirational’ throughout the organisational literature (e.g. House 1977; Conger and Kanungo 1988). These theories focus on exceptional leaders who have extraordinary effects on their followers and larger social systems (Shamir et al 1993); hence leaders transform the needs, desires, values and aspirations of followers from self- interest to collective interest. This is demonstrated through brand communities, and kinship, as followers become highly committed to the leader’s mission and often perform above and beyond what is expected of them. Charismatic Leadership is further demonstrated through the strong relationship between follower and brand by; emotional and motivational arousal through brand behaviour, nonverbal communications, visionary and inspirational messages and ideological appeals. Therefore, in layman terms, the more charismatic brands are, the more likely they are to experience overall higher brand resonance.Brand resonance is the outcome variable proposed for this research. Brand resonance aims to capitalise on previously acquired loyalty and equity (Huang et al 2014); thus brands add value to consumer goods by supplying meaning, and consumers like brands because they package meaning derived from interaction with the brand (Biel 1970). This can further be explained by an enduring sense of communal kinship and affiliation; which sees followers of the brand invest personal resources in order to stay connected (Keller 2001; Huang et al 2014). Social Identification Theory (Tafjel and Turner 1985) is used to support the outcome variable of brand resonance, as one of the primary drivers of brand resonance is that followers draw some association or similarity between themselves and the brand. Social Identification Theory is also closely linked to Charismatic Leadership Theory (Shamir et al 1993) (discussed below), as brand behaviours define the boundaries of the collectivity to emphasise its distinctiveness, prestige and competition with other groups. Such leader behaviour increases the salience of the collective identity in members’ self- concepts (Ashforth and Mael 1989); therefore, identification with the leader (brand) as it is perceived via a representative character (brand activities).Based on the above, we postulate the following:H1: High Presence of brand charisma will lead to high perception of luxuryH2: High perception of luxury will lead to high brand affectH3: High presence of brand charisma will lead to high brand affectH4: Perception of luxury mediates the relationship between presence of brand charisma and brand affectH5: High presence of brand affect will lead to high brand resonanceMethodologyMy research will encompass a mixed methods approach and be split into three predominant phases. The first being scale development, followed by stimulus development and finally the main study. The mixed method offers greater depth and breadth of understanding and corroboration (Johnson et al 2007) and is in line with the underlying pragmatist paradigm of this study (Johnson and Onwuegbzie 2004). A convenience sample will be used comprising of consumer panel data. The sampling frame will consist of everyday consumers, as these consumers need not be buyers of luxury brands.Phase 1: Scale DevelopmentThe scale development phase will use methods by Churchill (1979) and Devillis (1991). The purification, CFA, EFA and validity will be undertaken to refine and test the scale. The approximate sample for this phase is approximately 200 respondents.Phase 2: Stimulus DevelopmentThis phase will use expert panel to select the most appropriate charismatic brand and stimulus to use for this research. The potential brands of interest, thus far guided by literature, are; Hermes, Chanel, Dolce & Gabanna, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Valentino and Oscar de la Renta. The sample size of the expert panel will comprise of approximately 15-30 respondents (Endacott et al 1999; Keeney et al 2010).Phase 3: Main StudyThis phase will comprise of the self-administered questionnaire, with all sclaes measured on a 7- pinot Likert scale. With the use of an embedded stimulus, using consumer panel data with the sample size of approximately 800. Validation study will be included using psycho-physiological equipment available in the School of Marketing to validate the brand charisma scale; and to test whether there is positive emotions elicited that can be attributed to the charisma of the brand. This sample will consist of approximately 120, in line with recommended JCR guidelines.SignificanceTheoretical Contributions• Building and extending the current branding literature by conceptualising brand charisma, which has only been attempted in fragments throughout the literature.•Developing a scale to measure brand charisma in a luxury context. Until now, a brand charisma scale demonstrating rigour and validation is lacking within the literature• Empirically evaluating the developed brand charisma scale, validating the applicability and the moderating effects of brand charisma on the relationships between perception of luxury, brand experience and brand resonance.Methodological Contributions• This study will develop a brand charisma scale, employing psychometric properties to demonstrate reliability and validity.• This scale will then be used to further develop a Brand Charisma IndexManagerial ContributionsThis study aims to provide a blueprint for luxury brand managers, owners and policymakers on:• How to use brand charisma to grow brand community, brand attachment and brand engagement; vis-a – vis the brand.• Build stronger brands, that are resilient to market changes and fluctuation• Segmentation process to identify consumers with high brand resonanceTo identify what cues of brand charisma should be present for brand content and campaigns and how to augment these• For inaccessible and affordable luxury offerings, identify whether the presence of brand charisma should be used for both.Provide insights how the presence of brand charisma can impact and influence consumer’s perceptions and emotional responses."

However, little is known about the anti-fibrotic factors secreted from MSCs or their mechanisms.</P>   <P><B>Methods</B></P> <P>Umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UCMSCs) were differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells (hpUCMSCs), medium was collected, and secretome proteins were identified and quantified using nanochip-liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Liver fibrosis was induced in mice by intraperitoneal injection of thioacetamide or CCl<SUB>4</SUB>; some mice were then given injections of secretomes or proteins. Liver tissues were collected and analyzed by histology or polymerase chain reaction array to analyze changes in gene expression patterns. We analyzed the effects of MSC secretomes and potential anti-fibrotic proteins on transforming growth factor β 1 (TGFβ1)-mediated activation of human hepatic stellate cell (HSC) lines (hTert-HSC and LX2) and human primary HSCs.

Secretomes from UCMSCs, and to a greater extent from hpUCMSCs, reduced liver expression of multiple fibrotic factors, collagens, metalloproteinases, TGFβ, and Smad proteins in the TGFβ signaling pathways. In HSC cell lines and primary HSCs, TGFβ1-stimulated upregulation of α-SMA was significantly inhibited (and SMAD2 phosphorylation reduced) by secretomes from UCMSCs, and to a greater extent from hpUCMSCs. We identified 32 proteins in secretomes of UCMSCs that were more highly concentrated in secretomes from hpUCMSCs and inhibited TGFβ-mediated activation of HSCs. One of these, milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 (MFGE8), was a strong inhibitor of activation of human primary HSCs. We found MFGE8 to down-regulate expression of TGFβ type I receptor by binding to α<SUB>v</SUB>β<SUB>3</SUB> integrin on HSCs and to be secreted by MSCs from umbilical cord, teeth, and bone marrow. In mice, injection of recombinant human MFGE8 had anti-fibrotic effects comparable to those of the hpUCMSC secretome, reducing extracellular matrix deposition and HSC activation. Co-injection of an antibody against MFGE8 reduced the anti-fibrotic effects of the hpUCMSC secretome in mice.

anti-inflammatory effects of pelargonidin on tgfbip-induced responses,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P> Transforming growth factor β induced protein (TGFBIp) is an extracellular matrix protein expressed in several cell types in response to TGF-β. TGFBIp is released by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and functions as a mediator of experimental sepsis. Pelargonidin (PEL) is a well-known red pigment found in plants, and has been reported as having important biological activities that are potentially beneficial for human health. This study was undertaken to investigate whether PEL can modulate TGFBIp-mediated inflammatory responses in HUVECs and in mice. The anti-inflammatory activities of PEL were determined by measuring permeability, leukocyte adhesion and migration, and activation of proinflammatory proteins in TGFBIp-activated HUVECs and mice. In addition, the beneficial effects of PEL on survival rate in a mouse sepsis model were tested. We found that PEL inhibited TGFBIp-induced barrier disruption, expression of cell adhesion molecules and adhesion/transendothelial migration of neutrophils to human endothelial cells. PEL also suppressed TGFBIp-induced hyperpermeability and leukocyte migration in vivo. These results suggest that PEL possesses anti-inflammatory properties that result in inhibition of hyperpermeability, expression of cell adhesion molecules, and adhesion and migration of leukocytes, thereby endorsing its usefulness as a therapy for vascular inflammatory diseases. </P>"

That is, the purpose of this study was to find out the direction for creating folk knowledge or realizing opportunities for discussion as a theoretical cause on the reality.In this study, the issue of how to set the codes for creation and interpretation of folk knowledge came to the fore. For its resolution it was indispensible to analyze the meanings of diverse cases on folk phenomena, which means it was necessary to carry out another research where any studies on the meaning and value of folk were recognized again along with its relevance to the structure of modern Korean society. In particular, for the designing of folk-knowledge theory aimed at stronger social solidarity, it was needed to newly analyze the social properties and meanings that folk or folk knowledge has. Along with the progress of these researches, it became possible for the role and status of folk knowledge to be inquired into and ultimately the character and theoretical model of folk knowledge for social solidarity could be established.The character of ‘Candlelight Action(or Candlelight Vigil)’ can be appreciated differently depending on the its position in social structure, where, of course, the social structure interlocked with the nation along with the implication of ideological quality, power and dominant value. Accordingly, raising a question about candlelight action and social structure is an ultimate core to appreciating the functional relation between folk knowledge and structure of modern Korean society. Based on such structural analyses, the role and status of folk knowledge for social solidarity could be determined."

Low-level light therapy (LLLT) is increasingly used to alleviate pain and inflammation and promote wound healing. However, few studies have directly compared the effects of different wavelengths of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or examined their individual effects at the molecular level.Objective: Here we used a mouse model to investigate the effect of blue (410 nm), red (630 nm), and infrared (830 nm) LEDs on wound closure and assessed the underlying changes in a signal transduction pathway.Methods: A full-thickness wound was created on the dorsal skin of mice using a 6-mm-diameter punch. In part I, the wounds were irradiated using blue, red, and infrared LEDs. In part II, the wounds were irradiated at different time points. Photo documentation, serial skin biopsies, wound measurements, and immunohistochemical staining using TGF-β/SMAD pathway-related molecules were performed.Results: The overall wound closure percentage was highest during the first 10 days when an 830-nm LED was used. The wound closure process was accelerated when the irradiation was initiated immediately after wounding. Irradiation using 830-nm LED upregulated TGF-β and collagen-1 but downregulated SMAD7.Conclusion: Our findings show that LLLT using an 830-nm wavelength LED delivered immediately after wound formation may have the best effect on wound healing by upregulating the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway.

Thereceived channel data waveform due to side lobes have aspatial frequency of an integer plus a half. Doubling thelength of the channel data by appending zeros and takingthe discrete Fourier transform of the elongated data makesthe spatial frequency of the channel data due to side lobesbecome an integer.

Since the RCS of a sphere can be obtained theoretically, the theoretical RCS and the numerical RCS of the sphere according to the two modeling methods are compared and the differences are checked. The sphere RCS obtained by triangular modeling is very similar with the analytic solution, but that obtained by the Wire-Grid modeling is different from the analytic solution, and the difference is caused by the influence of the creeping wave. In addition, the effect of this creeping wave can be clearly distinguished by applying the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) which is one of the time-frequency analysis methods."

Proposed algorithm estimates the green area based HSI color space after detecting the pressure gauge through the circle detection in the image acquired from smart device, and then calculates the range angle of green area. The range angle of green area means that the normal pressure of the fire extinguisher is 7 to 9.8MPa. In order to effectively detect the needle in fire extinguisher pressure gauge, color patterns of the existing fire extinguisher pressure gauges were analyzed and defined, and the position angle of the indicating needle according to color pattern was measured. The actual pressure value is calculated based on the angle of the green area and the indicating needle. Some experimental results are conducted so as to verify the proposed algorithm, and the proposed method was able to determine objectively whether fire extinguisher pressure was normal."

It is often said that the Normal Schools succeeded in recruiting excellent students, producing qualified teachers and developing teaching profession through long-term educational curriculum. However, the success of the Normal Schools was due to the oppressed colonial circumstances, not the closed teacher training system itself. So, when the Japanese colonial administration came to an end, the strong point of the Normal Schools was supposed to be weak. As of now, we can witness that normal school system as a closed teacher training system in Korea was transformed into obstacle to producing creative teachers."

The pre-GEI equilibrium ap-proach for computing full-rank GEI equilibrium is useful because pre-GEI equi-librium always exist under standard conditions. The goal of the current paper is to develop algorithms which can be implemented to compute pre-GEI equilib-rium. The algorithms are built on a prototype system of equations which consist of the ﬁrst-order conditions for utility maximization and market clearing condi-tions. The prototype system can be directly encoded into an algorithm or can be transformed into implementable forms for algorithms such as homotopy path-following algorithms. Two examples are presented where the algorithms are implemented to compute pre-GEI equilibrium and their performance are com-paratively discussed.

Most of the current spatial interpolation methods however are isotropic, disregarding the river flow direction. Therefore, in this study, anisotrophic spatial interpolation methods were evaluated for their capability of predicting the river bed morphology/topology. Especially, the interpolation methods of inverse distance weighting, spline and kriging, combined with coordinate transformation from XY cartesian to SN curvilinear coordinates, were evaluated for their capability. Among them, the anisotrophic ordinary kriging with XY-to-SN coordinate transformation was proven the most accurate and reliable interpolation method for predicting the river bed morphology/topology. This state-of-the-art spatial interpolation method will help better prediction of the river bed morphology/topology and the 2, 3-dimensional hydrodynamics."
adaptive dynamic surface control for a hypersonic aircraft using neural networks,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>A hypersonic aircraft dynamic model is highly nonlinear because its flight conditions are usually determined at high altitude and Mach number. Therefore, there always exist differences between the dynamical model and real system, and uncertainties during the flight, thus, leading significant degradation of control performance. To solve the performance degradation problem, this paper proposes neural networks-based adaptive velocity and altitude tracking controllers. In order for that, the hypersonic aircraft model is transformed into an uncertain feedback system, which has both matched and unmatched uncertainties, by differentiating the velocity and altitude with respect to time. Then, the overall tracking control system is designed systematically by introducing virtual control inputs and dynamic surface control. During the design process, an inverse of an input gain matrix is directly trained and adapted to remove the matched uncertainty and controller singularity problem simultaneously. In addition, several adaptive elements with saturation functions are added to handle all the matched and unmatched uncertainties. The proposed controller guarantees the uniformly ultimate boundedness of the tracking error by utilizing deadzoned errors. Finally, numerical simulations with the uncertain hypersonic aircraft are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</P>"

However, their manipulation features a great number of constraints and limitations. Therefore, the ceramic arts continues to depend on traditional methods for shaping and decoration. In particular, due to the requirements of firing, ceramic objects must be capable of withstanding the heat inside the kiln and are usually created in a closed form.This research begins with a critical insight into these technical constraints. It focuses on developing novel means to model ceramics works, such as opening closed forms or diversifying decoration methods. In this research, I focused on the potential of “folds” embedded in materials, which make it possible to overcome a number of technical constraints. Here I investigated ways to diversify folds. First of all, I examined theories about folds through Leibniz’s and Deleuze’s writing, and discussed the properties of these folds. Based on these theories, I conducted experiments with materials and types of folds through my own work. In addition, I analyzed and demonstrated the several steps in producing folds, including description (from the expansion of organic lines), materialization, and individualization (to express artistic sensibility).Through this research, I have propelled folds, which had been used simply for ornamenting the surface of ceramic artworks, into an independent form. I also found that an individualized fold used in ceramics can transform a closed form into an open one (from a concept of mass to one of volume) for the structure of ceramic works. Lastly, I suggested a method for enjoying the natural and organic form of ceramic works by firing a clay body into which has been incorporated other materials."

Experimental program comprised fifty five square concrete column specimens for different eleven types. The compression test results confirmed that the strengthening effect can be increased by the confinement of wrapped and bonded CFRP sheet. However, the confining effect was decreased with the increase of square column size. The other hand, the ductility in square concrete column greatly increased due to caging effect of CFRP sheet. The transformation in shape from square to circular considerably increased both the compressive strength and the ductility of the concrete column wrapped with CFRP sheet. In addition, using test results and existing studies, accuracy and reliability of the existing strength models for CFRP-confined square concrete are verified."

Existing methods to localization, however, do not fully consider constraints on the position and path-loss parameters, resulting in positional inaccuracy and a large distance error. In this paper, we account for every necessary constraint and estimate jointly the target position and path-loss parameters. We formulate an optimization and transform the objective function to simplify a localization method. We compare the proposed method to a competitive baseline using the distance error as a metric. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline in most test cases. The proposed method to localization is accurate, simple, and suitable for unknown environments."

dynamic analysis of an axially moving robot manipulator supported by bearings,2017,"['Axially moving robot manipulator', 'Mode exchange', 'Tip mass effect', 'Natural frequency loci veering']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In this study, a robot manipulator is modelled as a cantilever beam, which moves in an axial direction, has a lumped mass at the end, and is supported by intermediate springs. Considering the tip mass and intermediate springs in the modeling, we derive the equations of motion in which the rigid-body motion is coupled with the flexible motions, and then analyze the transverse vibrations of the beam. Furthermore, we study the tip mass effects on the natural frequencies and the corresponding mode shapes. The natural frequency loci veering is analyzed for variations in the tip mass and the spring position/stiffness. In addition, we investigate the exchange and localization of modes around these veering regions as well as the parameter effects on the mode shapes. Using a Short-time Fourier transform (STFT), the relationship between the dynamic characteristics and dynamic responses are described. It is found that the dynamic characteristics of the beam are dependent on the veering distance. It is also shown via dynamic responses that the mode exchanges occur when a veering distance is close."

It is an attractive business organization that extend the business very fast with limited capital and manage process of distribution suitably. In other words, the company that move toward proper business management and improvement consider franchise as best profitable alternative for business goal achievement when they enter the new market. Also, nowadays the contract with franchise is general procedure which is used to improve the company. Franchise headquarters minimize surveillance expenses and sell the operation procedure and trademark to franchisee. However, the comment of qualitative development of franchise business is increase consistently. The high-handedness of franchisor is getting worse and worse in franchise conflict, high-pressure sales, imposing exorbitant costs on advertisement and promotion and offering exaggerated and false information. Thus, this study carry out an empirical study targeting franchisee to do research influence of mediator effect of brand authenticity with ethical management that franchisee perceived in one of the franchise research field which is emphasized. All measures were adapted from or developed based on prior research. Cross-sectional data for this study were collected from 256 franchisee of multi-level marketing company. To analyze the data, a structural equation model procedure using regression were employed. At the result of the empirical analysis, first, when the franchisee recognizes the ethical culture perceived by the franchisor, the franchisor is strongly aware of brand authenticity. Second, the transformational leadership of the franchisor recognized by the franchisee has found that there is a moderating effect of enhancing the relationship between ethical culture and brand authenticity. Third, brand authenticity perceived by franchisee increased the factor of compliance, while opportunistic behavior decreased. Both factors supported the hypothesis. Finally, regulation of the franchisor recognized by the franchisee makes the moderating effects weaken, and the regulation in the relationship between brand authenticity and opportunistic behavior makes the moderating effects strengthen. This study confirms that ethics management can contribute altruistically to improvement of relationship with franchisee as a form of autonomous regulation for franchisor who do unfair trade and behave exclusivity. The ethical culture supported by many scholars is that ethical conflict can arise when the perception of ethical value to the leader or manager is inconsistent with the company members, which is accompanied by a lot of work stress, and as a result, the ethical culture can play a decisive role about formation and maintenance of relationships. In the end, the ethical culture perceived from the franchisee point of view in the franchisor can reduce transaction costs and is an important success factor for long-term transactions. Therefore, System operation, which encourages the franchisee to participate more actively and collects their opinions, is required. it is necessary to build a system that can understand each other through concrete system and self-helping effort, because the ethics management system of the franchisor is operated and organized nominally."

It estimates the spillovers for the rest of the world with a special focus on Sub-Saharan African countries. By 2030, an average 1 percent annual slowdown of China’s GDP is expected to result in 1.1 percent GDP decline in Sub- Saharan Africa and a 0.6 percent global slowdown relative to past trends. However, if China’s transformation also entails substantial rebalancing, the negative income effects of the economic slowdown could be offset through higher overall imports by China and positive terms-of-trade effects for its trading partners. Slowdown and rebalancing in China is estimated to increase GDP by 4.7 percent for Sub-Saharan Africa and by 4.8 percent for the global economy. China’s transformation is also estimated to reduce poverty, but the extent depends on country in the sub-saharan Africa."

We proposed a moderated mediation model where cynicism is a mediator in the relationship between social-relational stress coming from employees’ direct supervisor, customers, and co-workers and service orientation. Transactional and transformational leadership were proposed to moderate the effect of social-relational stress on cynicism. The results showed that employees’ social-relational stress from their co-workers and direct supervisors was negatively associated with service orientation, but stress from customers did not show statistically meaningful effect on service orientation. In the test of mediation, bootstrapping results showed that the negative effects of social-relational stress from co-workers and direct supervisors on service orientation were partially mediated by cynicism. Furthermore transactional leadership factors moderated the degree of this mediation paths between social-relational stress and cynicism, but moderated mediation hypothesis of transformational leadership was not supported. Based on the results shown in the analyses, we found that social-relational stress coming from the workplace relationship meaningfully and negatively affect service orientation through mediation of cynicism, and transactional leadership can mitigate this effect. We argue that in order to increase more voluntary service orientation from employees in the public sector, leadership should play an important role to decrease the level of cynicism coming from social-relational stress in the public sector. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

Due to the lack of torque for rotational motion of ligaments, the existing porous structure of circular holes shows positive Poisson’s ratio under tension loading. Also, the porous structure of elliptic holes has a drawback of low durability due to stress concentration. Thus, we design curved ligaments to increase the rotational torque under tension and to alleviate the stress concentration such that strain energy is uniformly distributed in the whole structure. The developed structure possesses better stiffness and durability than the existing structures. It also exhibits the negative Poisson ratio in both compression and tension of 10% nominal strain. Through nonlinear finite element analysis, the performance of developed structure is compared with the existing structure of elliptic holes. The developed structure turns out to be significantly improved in terms of stiffness and durability."

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and associated molecules promote tubulointerstitial fibrosis; however, effective therapies targeting these molecules have yet to be developed. Lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2), which is involved in invasive growth and metastasis of malignant neoplasms, has recently been reported to serve a key role in hepatic and pulmonary fibrosis. However, little is currently known regarding LOXL2 expression in the kidney and its involvement in tubulointerstitial fibrosis. The present study evaluated LOXL2 expression in human and mouse kidney tissues, as well as in cultured renal cells. LOXL2 protein expression was detected in glomerular capillary loops and tubular epithelial cells in human and mouse kidneys. Glomerular LOXL2 was localized to the cytoplasm of podocytes, as determined by double immunofluorescence microscopy using a podocyte marker (synaptopodin). This result was supported by western blot analysis, which demonstrated that LOXL2 protein expression is present in cultured human podocytes and HK-2 human proximal tubular cells. In addition, the mRNA and protein expression levels of LOXL2 were higher in a mouse model of tubulointerstitial fibrosis compared with in control mice. In addition, immunohistochemistry results demonstrated that LOXL2 is present in the fibrous interstitium and infiltrating mononuclear cells in a mouse model of tubulointerstitial fibrosis. The present study demonstrated that LOXL2 is expressed in compartments of renal tissue, where it appears to contribute to the progression of tubulointerstitial fibrosis.</P>"

The times of ideology and philosophy had waned while the diverse civilizations clash, in which the technological advance and socio-economic environment inflict a tremendous change for the private and public mode of our contemporary livings. In fact, the increasing diversity and volatility of community has brought the crisis and challenge against the constitutional tradition. In this backdrop, the paper examines the relationship of those two values embedded on the states of modern constitutionalism-limited toward the modern administrative state through this new millenium. The law or right and democracy as a political ideals is not futile merely with tweaks, but foundational or inseparably entwined into the value system of modern minds. We can be clear if to imagine of the times for the divinity of monarchy or feudal piety. The civil revolution for modern constitutionalism created a new order of society and nations began or manage to practice their national politics and administration on its basis. The recent tumultus in South Korea, stretching from the candlelight vigil through the impeachment and incrimination of lady president, actually imprinted a deep wake for the politics of Koreans. In this line of thought alignment, the concept of democratic experimentalism engrafted with the rule of constitution was revisited that could give a lesson as a sedative meliorism for the radicalism or mob politics. Additionally, I presented some of brief evaluation about the Korean ways by gathering my thoughts on the candlelight vigil. Despite both of strengths and weaknesses on the theory of democratic experimentalism, I cordially suggest that it could work as a model to meet the increasing need of national competitiveness, participation, information sharing and learning as well as the protection of civil rights embedded on the constitutional tradition."

Then communication load requests of the BS are transformed to energy demand queues, and battery energy level and worst-case delay constraints are considered into the virtual queue to ensure the network QoS when our objective is to minimize the long term electricity cost of BSs. Lyapunov optimization method is applied to work out the optimization objective without knowing the future information of the communication load, real-time electricity market price and renewable energy availability. Finally, linear programming is used, and the corresponding energy efficient scheduling policy is obtained. The performance analysis of our proposed online algorithm based on real-world traces demonstrates that it can greatly reduce one day’s electricity cost of individual BS."

Considering that the choice of the process and measurement error covariance matrices affects seriously the performance of the extended Kalman filter (EKF), the EKF-ML method uses the maximum likelihood method to adaptively optimize the error covariance matrices and the initial conditions. This can ensure that the EKF has better accuracy and faster convergence for estimating the voltage amplitude (states). Moreover, without more complexity, the EKF-ML algorithm is almost as simple as the conventional EKF, but it has better anti-disturbance performance and more accuracy in detection of the voltage sag. More importantly, the EKF-ML algorithm is capable of accurately estimating the noise parameters and is robust against various noise levels. Simulation results show that the proposed method performs with a fast dynamic and tracking response, when voltage signals contain harmonics or a pulse and are jointly embedded in an unknown measurement noise."

With the relationship between the three-phase system and the double-circuit line system, a phase-mode transformation matrix for doublecircuit lines can be derived. Based on the derived matrix, the double-circuit lines with faults can be decoupled, and then the fault location for an incomplete-journey double-circuit line is achieved by using modal components in the mode domain. The algorithm is divided into two steps. Firstly, the fault branch is identified by comparing the relationships of voltage amplitudes at the bonding point. Then the fault location, on the basis of the identification result, is calculated by using a two-terminal method, and only the fault distance of the actual fault branch can be obtained.

The Revolution has made various impacts on most of industries. To keep pace with the tide, a number of training methods has been introduced to develop the attributes required. The most popular method is Hackathon, which is believed to be the most suitable model to promote cooperation among teammates. Hackathon is a training method for solving problems by working as a team and collaborating with teammates and is currently being applied to group training programs not only at universities and public institutions but also at firms in IT and automobile industries. This study confirmed enhancing effect of team-based training on concentration through interviews and questionnaires (conducted in 2014, 2015, 2017) with participants who has joined DanKuk University Jiphyeonjeon Hackathon program. The quantitative results showed that transformational attitude of leader is beneficial to concentration, and that team culture has meditation effect when combined altogether. In addition, interviews with participants also proved the positive effect of the leader’s attitude and the culture on team members’ view on establishing a new business and team’s cohesiveness. Based on these results, we can conclude that leadership and team culture determines how effective the training program is can be. The study suggests direction to future training programs for business start-ups."

Asking how music-analytical statements are produced, excluded, and transformed, the paper draws on Michel Foucault’s method of discourse analysis which has been adapted by Gavin Kendall and Gary Wickham into a set of more pragmatic guidelines. The paper focuses on the two general elements of music analysis, representation and judgment, and delves into various strategies that today’s musicologists use in their analyses of music. Regarding the issue of representation, it discusses ways in which music analysts handle scores and performances, problems of representing gender and other differences in music, and expanding and changing objects of music analysis. Regarding judgment, it explores the dynamic relationship between music theory and music, and the traditional aesthetic question of how to mediate between form and other content of music. The ultimate goal of this study is to reconsider the values and future direction of music analysis."

As for the Markovian arrival processes, the moments of stationary intervals are given as a polynomial function of parameters whereas the moments of the counting process involve exponential terms. Therefore, moment fittings are more complicated with the counting process than with stationary intervals. However, in queueing network analysis, cross-correlation between point processes can be modeled more conveniently with counting processes than with stationary intervals. A Laplace-Stieltjies transform of the stationary intervals of MAP (3)s is recently proposed in minimal number of parameters. We extend the results and present the Laplace transform of the counting process of MAP (3)s. We also show how moments of the counting process such as index of dispersions for counts, IDC, and limiting IDC can be used for moment fittings. Examples of exact MAP (3) moment fittings are also presented on the basis of moments of stationary intervals and those of the counting process."

The influence of distribution and characteristics of sensors on the cantilever beam on the accuracy of determining the support moment which improves in the course of transition from the uniform distribution of sensors to optimal non-uniform distribution is shown. On the basis of the theory of inverse problems the method of transformation reduction at numerical differentiation of deflection functions has been studied.

an intelligent computational approach for design optimization of stiffened engineering structures,2017,"['Layout design', 'Growth simulation', 'Topology optimization', 'Stiffness transformation']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper has proposed an additive design method for the design of stiffening topology of load-bearing structures in a growth manner. The idea of the method is drawn from the observation that branching structures in nature (e.g., leaf venation) can effectively support a relatively large structure or perfuse a relatively large region. The excellent performance of branching structures is considered as a result of their adaptive growth with respect to the environmental conditions and their configuration features of branching and hierarchy. To apply the principle of adaptive growth to stiffener layout design, a mathematical model for growth simulation is constructed. Based on this, an evolutionary algorithm is developed to implement the adaptive growth of stiffeners. A numerical treatment called “stiffness transforming operation” is introduced to enable stiffeners to grow along arbitrary directions and thus form optimized stiffener layouts. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified with numerical examples."

This study estimated a wave model (mild slope eq. model) by analyzing the wave energy transmission according to the changing of impact factors (width of channel, bottom slope in channel, incident wave angle, wave period). The results of the numerical experiments showed that the major impact factors influencing wave energy transmission are the width of channel and incident wave direction.

Microtremor data were transformed into the frequency domain, and then the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratios (HVSR) were calculated. Fundamental resonance frequencies were estimated from the HVSR results for every observation point. Using the empirical relationship between site period and thickness for sediment sites in Korea known from the previous study, the distribution of sediment thickness of the Chogye basin was estimated from the fundamental resonance frequencies. Being compared with the mountainous rim with steep slope, the measurement points inside the basin have low values of the fundamental resonance frequency with the minimum of 1.03 Hz, which corresponds to the thickness of sedimentary layer with the maximum depth of about 100 m. A three-dimensional basin model was constructed for bedrock topography of the Chogye basin by an interpolation of basin depths estimated at each measurement site."

Methods: Chemical composition analysis, carbohydrate fractionation, in situ ruminal degradability, and DVE/OEB model were used to measure nutrient profile and availability of alfalfa hay. Univariate analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis (CLA) and principal components analysis (PCA) were conducted to identify FT/IR spectra differences. Results: The FT/IR non-structural carbohydrate (NSCHO) to total carbohydrates and NSCHO to structural carbohydrate ratios decreased (p<0.05), while lignin to NSCHO and lipid CH3 symmetric to CH2 symmetric ratios increased with advancing maturity (p<0.05). The FT/IR spectra related to structural carbohydrates, lignin and lipids were distinguished for alfalfa hay at three maturities by PCA and CLA, while FT/IR molecular structures related to carbohydrates and lipids were similar between alfalfa hay cut in the morning and afternoon when analyzed by PCA and CLA analysis. Positive correlations were found for FT/IR NSCHO to total carbohydrate and NSCHO to structural carbohydrate ratios with non-fiber carbohydrate (by wet chemistry), ruminal fast and intermediately degradable carbohydrate fractions and total ruminal degradability of carbohydrates and predicted intestinal nutrient availability in dairy cows ($r{\geq}0.60$; p<0.05) whereas FT/IR lignin to NSCHO and CH3 to CH2 symmetric stretching ratio had negative correlation with predicted ruminal and intestinal nutrient availability of alfalfa hay in dairy cows ($r{\geq}-0.60$; p<0.05). Conclusion: FT/IR carbohydrate and lipid molecular structures in alfalfa hay changed with advancing maturity from early bud to early flower, but not during the day, and these molecular structures correlated with predicted nutrient supply of alfalfa hay in ruminants."

Arabidopsis thaliana HIGH PLOIDY2 (HPY2), a SUMO E3 ligase, might therefore be expected to promote celldivision and increase organ size when overexpressed in the model ornamental plant Petunia multiflora. One monthafter Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, nine putative transgenic P. multiflora plants were regenerated on selectionmedium, and were found to have high expression levels of AtHPY2. The proportion of cells in G2M phase, lengthof in vitro-cultivated plantlets, and trichome length all increased in transgenic lines compared with the wild type(WT). Transgenic petunia lines also exhibited increased growth, leaf and flower area, and flower number. Flowering timewas also faster in transgenic P. multiflora than in the WT, and flower numbers increased. These results suggest thatAtHPY2 overexpression stimulates cell division. This finding may be useful in controlling plant and flower size, andflowering timing and abundance in P. multiflora and other ornamentals."

The new DPC approach is based on two main tasks. First the optimization of the look-up table, which is well-known in conventional DPC, is outlined for selecting the optimum converter output voltage vectors. Secondly a very simple and effective method is used to directly calculate their duty cycles from the power errors. Therefore, the measured active and reactive powers are made to track their references using hysteresis controllers. Then two vectors are selected and applied during one control cycle to minimize both the active and reactive power ripples. The main advantages of this method are that there is no need of linear current controllers, coordinates transformations or modulators. In addition, the control strategy is able to operate at constant switching frequencies to ease the design of the power converter and the AC harmonic filter. The control exhibits a good steady state performance and improves the dynamic response without any overshoot in the line current. Theoretical principles of the proposed method are discussed. Both simulation and experimental results are presented to verify the performance and effectiveness of this control scheme."

In addition, the top leaders of North Korea considered nuclear and missile as meaningful means in the process of strategically responding to environmental factors, both inside and outside, with the aim of reproduction of political leadership. In this process, the nuclear and missile technologies consist of multiple meanings in terms of economic and security, and finally consist of cognitive centrality and value centrality that reproduce political legitimacy. Therefore, the current nuclear-missile oriented path is too expensive to be converted to an alternative path depending on the change of the external environment. In other words, path dependency is the most intensified situation. However, since the Sixth Nuclear Test in 2017 and the sanctions of the international community will present a different external environment from the past, the possibility of the emergence of an alternative paths have increased. The emergence of alternative paths and the possibility of transformation are also appropriate in relation to the leadership crisis of the supreme leader, which will vary depending on how security and economic factors are structured."

Since the advent of 4D printing, much research has been conducted on smart materials and application of 4D printing in diverse areas. However, research and development of 4D printing software is very limited due to the fact that 4D printing technology is still a novelty. Nevertheless, the time characteristics of 4D printing require appropriate 4D printing software to produce effective 4D printing outputs. In this article, we first introduce 4D printing technology and discuss its application in various fields. Then, we focus on the software required for 4D printing. More specifically, we present six types of software solutions needed to fully support corresponding stages in the 4D printing process: simulation, modeling, slicing, host/firmware, monitoring, and printing management software (PMS), respectively. We discuss how each software solution can sufficiently carry out the designated functions at each stage of the 4D printing process and propose that these software solutions can together provide all of the required operations for 4D printing."
comparative study of three fault diagnostic methods for three phase inverter with induction motor,2017,"['Fault detection and diagnosis', 'Electrical drive system', 'Clarke transformation', 'Features extraction', 'Neural network system', 'Discrete wavelet transform']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In recent times, inverters are considered as the basic building block in an electrical drive system used widely in many industrial drive applications. However, the reliability of these inverters is mainly affected by the failure of power electronic switches. Various faults in inverter may influence the system operation by unexpected maintenance, which increases the cost factor and reduce overall efficiency. In this paper, comparative study of three different fault detection and diagnosis systems for three phase inverter is presented. The basic purpose of these fault detection and diagnosis systems is to detect single or multiple faults efficiently. These techniques rely on the neural network for fault detection and diagnosis by using Clarke transformed two-dimensional features extraction, three-dimensional features extraction and features extraction using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with a different number of features in each technique. Several features are extracted using different mechanisms and used in the neural network as input for fault detection and diagnosis. Furthermore, a simulation study is carried out to analyze the fault detection and diagnosis response of these techniques. Also, a comparative study has been performed by considering fault detection time and accuracy. Comparison results prove the supremacy of three-dimensional feature extraction technique over other two techniques as it can detect and diagnose single, double and triple faults in a single cycle with high accuracy as compared to other two techniques multi-cycles detection."
변화하는 다문화사회에서 한국교회 선교의 전략과 과제,2017,"['다문화주의', '동화주의', '다원주의', '혼합(통합)주의', '다문화사회선교', 'Multiculturalism', 'Assimilation', 'Pluralism', 'Syncretism', 'Multicultural Soecity Mission']","교회는 본질적으로 선교를 그 사명으로 하고 있다. 교회가 선교를 수행할 때 그 효율성과 중요성 그리고 시급성을 고려하여 전략을 세우게 된다. 교회 선교의 역사를 보면 여러 변천의 과정을 거쳐 현대에 이르렀다. 윌리엄 케리는 기독교선교 제1기인 해안선교시대를 열었고 허드슨 테일러는 제2기인 내지 선교시대를 열었다. 위클리프성경번역선교회의 창시자인 카메룬 타운젠트와 교회성장학파를 시작한 도널드 맥가브란은 이전의 국가중심의 선교에서 제3기인 미전도 종족 선교시대를 열었다. 이후에 세계선교에 있어서 보다 전략적인 접근으로써 제4기인 전방개척선교시대를 넘어 이제는 제5기에 해당하는 다민족-다문화사회 선교시대에 이르게 되었다. 지금의 한국교회는 두 가지 다문화 사회 속에서 현장성 있는 선교형태의 변화를 요구받고 있다. 첫째는 단일민족, 단일언어, 단일문화 속에서 성장한 한국교회는 세계화의 과정에서 급속히 변화하는 다문화사회를 대상으로 선교사를 파송해야 하는 문제이다. 이미 전 세계는 다문화- 세계화로 변천하여 이에 맞는 국가정책이 시행되고 있다. 둘째는 한국사회가 다문화사회로 이미 바뀌면서 빠른 속도로 변화하고 있기 때문에 국내 다문화 선교형태의 변화를 요구받고 있다. 따라서 본 논문에서는 다문화사회에 대한 교회선교의 전략과 과제를 다루었다. 세계화의 현상으로써 다문화사회의 형성 요인들과 세계 각국의 사회 통합정책은 교회 선교에 있어서 변화를 요청하고 있다. 이 변화의 요청에 맞춰서 선교의 전략을 새롭게 세우기 위해서 그 근거는 항상 성경에 뿌리를 두어야 한다. 성경에 나타난 선교의 전략과 방법은 복음을 다문화사회로 이동 시키는 것을 증언하고 있다. 아브라함은 가나안의 다문화사회로 포로 된 다니엘은 바벨론의 다문화사회로 복음을 들고 이동했다. 이 과정에서 성경에 나타난 다문화 사회 통합정책은 동화주의, 혼합주의, 다원주의 모델이 있다. 성경은 다문화사회 선교에 있어서 복음의 유일성과 절대성을 유지하면서 현장에 분리되지 않는 상황화 선교를 강조하고 있다. 다문화사회에서 복음을 전하는 선교는 매우 전략적이다. 다문화사회는 그 구성원들이 서로 다른 지역과 국가와 문화적 배경을 갖고 있는 상태에서 여러 이유로 본국을 떠나서 형성된 새로운 사회이다. 이들은 본국의 문화와 연결할 수 있는 가교가 될 수 있다. 바울은 로마의 다문화도시인 대도시 중심으로 복음을 전략적으로 전했다. 이렇게 한 이유는 중심도시는 위성도시와 여러 형태로 연결되어 있기 때문이다. 이렇듯 선교는 문화와 깊은 관계가 있으며 문화이해는 선교의 출발점이 될 수 있다. 문화의 심층구조에는 세계관이 자리 잡고 있고 그 성격은 종교성을 지니고 있다. 다문화사회에서 선교는 상황적인 선교와 국가의 다문화사회 통합정책과 함께 동역의 전략이 효과적이다. 또한 이전보다 다문화사회는 언어와 문화와 종교이해와 이에 대응하는 선교훈련의 과제를 안고 있다.","Mission is the Church`s most fundamental calling. When a church works to fulfill its missionary calling, the community works to form strategies while considering the importance, urgency and efficiency of its mission. When we review ecclesiastic history, it is clear that the Church has gone through many changes to reach its modern form. William Kerry began the age of coastal mission, the first epoch of Christian mission, and Hudson Taylor started the age of inland mission. Cameron Townsend who founded Wycliff Bible Translators and Donald McGavran who started the Church Growth Movement, pioneered the third epoch of mission targeting unreached people groups. Following this phase, we have now gone even beyond the fourth epoch of pioneering missions and have reached the age of mission for multinational and multicultural societies. Today the Korean Church requires a more down-to-earth form of mission within two different kinds of multi-cultural societies. The first problem is that the Korean Church must dispatch missionaries to multicultural societies that have formed as an byproduct of globalization, despite the fact that most Koreans have been exposed to only one language and one culture. The rest of the world has already become more multicultural and respective governments are enacting policies that are appropriate for such changes. The second problem is that even Korea is quickly becoming more multicultural and the need for a alternative form of missionary work is necessary. Therefore, this paper will focus on ecclesiastical missionary strategies and tasks that lie ahead. The factors that bring about multicultural societies and many nations` social integration policies are calling for change in current ecclesiastical missionary work. In order to establish the said new strategy, the main focus must be rooted in the Scriptures. The Bible testifies missional strategies and methods for bringing the Gospel to multicultural societies. For instance, Abraham and Daniel respectively delivered the Good News to multicultural lands such as Canaan and Babylon. In the process, the Bible also contains testimony of social integration policies that act as models for assimilation, syncretism and pluralism. The Bible emphasizes a process of contextualization that maintains the oneness and exclusivity of the Gospel while maintaining a connection with society itself. Mission targeting multicultural societies must be very strategic. Because individual members of such societies mainly come from different nations and cultural backgrounds they tend to form a new group away from their respective fatherlands. Such groups could act like bridges to their countries of origin. The Apostle Paul strategically spread the Gospel to major urban areas home to many different cultures. The reason being that one urban center tends to be connected to many other smaller satellite cities. Likewise, mission has a very deep connection to culture and understanding of culture can be a stepping stone for missionary work. One can discover world views deeply embedded in cultural structures and they often tend to have religious characteristics. Mission in multicultural societies is most effective through a combination of contextual mission and nations` integration policies and strategic partnerships. In addition, we require a new form of mission training which has a higher focus on understanding languages, religions and cultures."

Such changes in environment will accelerate transformation of our living patterns. In addition, rapidly changing technologies will open up the un-purposed environment, even before we become aware of the purpose, functions, and value of spatial design. Against such a backdrop, it is extremely difficult to clarify the differentiation of spatial design. Thus, this study intends to reinterpret the concept of design differentiation and expand the tools of related elements in order to investigate the differentiation in spatial design. (Method) This study identified characteristic elements of design differentiation through comparative analysis of preceding studies, and derived new tools based on examination of Deleuze`s theory of “difference” to expand the design elements of differentiation. The study proposed an evaluation model that structuralized the derived design differentiation elements and Deleuze`s characteristics of difference as relational controlling factors. Moreover, the study verified the expansion of design differentiation tools, which were added through analyses of interior spaces in self-driving cars, based on the scope of relevant cases. (Results) First, the uniqueness, suitability, and justifiability, which were characteristics with the highest distribution among design differentiation elements in self-driving car space, turned out to be important elements for differentiation. Second, the tools added from Deleuze`s theory of difference were subsequently analyzed, so that the nature and meaning inherent in the object (interior space of self-driving car) could be understood more in-depth from the standpoint of a causal relationship. In other words, the space, which was interpreted through sameness for design nuances and overall function-centricity of space, was analyzed with heterogeneous elements such as substance, shape, etc., and therefore the differentiation could be analyzed more specifically. Third, the results of analyses suggested that interpretation of this design differentiation and expansion of tools could provide a basis for in-depth analyses of differentiated spatial characteristics. (Conclusions) This case study on the application of the concept of design differentiation in spatial design showed that the evaluation tool could be expanded to re-establish the concept of differentiation in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Thus, the study added the 5 tools (object, substance, shape, uniformity, and individualization), extracted reason from Deleuze`s theory of difference, and analyzed the causal relationship between function-centric and emotional perspectives. In that way, the study could analyze the concept of differentiated design with greater clarity and objectivity, so both the design and its meaning can be reinterpreted in the realm of spatial design to be more technology-oriented."

However, due to the large size of the image, there is a limitation in manually extracting coronary arteries, and related researches are performed to automatically extract coronary arteries accurately. As the coronary artery originate from the ascending aorta, the ascending aorta and ostium should be detected to extract the coronary tree accurately. In this paper, we propose an automatic segmentation for the ostium as a starting structure of coronary artery in CTA. First, the region of the ascending aorta is initially detected by using Hough circle transform based on the relative position and size of the ascending aorta. Second, the volume of interest is defined to reduce the search range based on the initial area. Third, the refined ascending aorta is segmented by using a two-dimensional geodesic active contour. Finally, the two ostia are detected within the region of the refined ascending aorta. For the evaluation of our method, we measured the Euclidean distance between the result and the ground truths annotated manually by medical experts in 20 CTA images. The experimental results showed that the ostia were accurately detected."

The variation of mean pressure coefficients, pressure distribution over the surface, flow pattern and force coefficient are evaluated for each cases and represented graphically to understand extent of nonconformities due to such angular modifications in plan. Finally regular cross shaped building results are compared with wind tunnel results obtained from similar '+' shaped building study with similar flow condition. Reduction in along wind force coefficients for angular crossed shaped building, observed for various skew angles leads to develop lesser along wind force on building compared to regular crossed shaped building and square plan shaped building. Interference effect within the internal faces are observed in particular faces of building for both cases, considerably. Significant deviation is noticed in wind induced responses for angular cross building compared to regular cross shaped building for different direction wind flow."

uranium release from acidic weathered hanford sediments: single-pass flow-through and column experiments,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The reaction of acidic radioactive waste with sediments can induce mineral transformation reactions that, in turn, control contaminant fate. Here, sediment weathering by synthetic uranium containing acid solutions was investigated using bench-scale experiments to simulate waste disposal conditions at Hanford's cribs (Hanford, WA). During acid weathering, the presence of phosphate exerted a strong influence over uranium mineralogy and a rapidly precipitated, crystalline uranium phosphate phase (meta-ankoleite [K(UO2)(PO4).3H(2)O] was identified using spectroscopic and diffraction-based techniques. In phosphate-free system, uranium oxyhydroxide minerals such as K-compreignacite [K-2(UO2)(6)O-4(OH)(6).7H(2)O] were formed. Single-pass flow-through (SPFT) and column leaching experiments using synthetic Hanford pore water showed that uranium precipitated as meta-ankoleite during acid weathering was strongly retained in the sediments, with an average release rate of 2.67 X 10(-12) mol g(-1) s(-1). In the absence of phosphate, uranium release was controlled by dissolution of uranium oxyhydroxide (compreignacitetype) mineral with a release rate of 1.05-2.42 X 10(-1) mol g(-1) s(-1). The uranium mineralogy and release rates determined for both systems in this study support the development of accurate U-release models for the prediction of contaminant transport. These results suggest that phosphate minerals may be a good candidate for uranium remediation approaches at contaminated sites.</P>"

To minimize the error caused by mode truncation, ECB-like formulation, which considers the effect of residual modes, is employed and computes the maximum response of the given dynamic system. By using this method, we found that the response by the ECB model is more accurate and efficient over the classical Craig-Bampton (CB) model due to the enhanced transformation matrix from being subjected to an unexpected high frequency LV load. To demonstrate this performance, we solved several benchmark problems associated with CDLA."

Using a tool previously built by us called GPES, we collected information of projects, such as abstract syntax trees, tokens, software metrics, relations, and evolutions, for our experiments. We analyzed the contexts of source codes in existing projects to predict changes automatically and to recommend suitable libraries for the projects. The collected data show that researchers can reduce the overall cost of data analysis by transforming the extracted data into the required input formats with a simple query-based implementation. Also, we manually evaluated how the extracted contexts are similar to the description and we found that a sufficient number of the words in the contexts is similar and it might help developers grasp the domain of the source codes easily."
appropriate tensile mode and timing of applying tension to promote tendon gel regeneration,2017,"['Collagen fiber', 'Tensile stress', 'Structural control', 'Atomic force microscope', 'Fourier transform infrared']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"‘‘Tendon gel’’ secreted from a parent tendon is regenerated for tendon repair by applying tension. However, the details of the tensile stimulus have not been clarified. This study aimed to evaluate an appropriate tensile stimulus mode and the optimal timing of applying tension to promote tendon gel regeneration. Tendon gel was prepared using a film model method in mice and was preserved in vivo for 3, 5, and 10 days. Unlike tendon gel on day 3 or day 5, a fibrous structure developed in the tendon gel on day 10 when tension was applied. Infrared spectroscopy revealed that characteristic peaks appearing for the tendon gel on days 3 and 5 disappeared on day 10. Disappearance of the peaks indicated maturity of the tendon gel, and it showed the optimal timing for tension application to the tendon gel. The effect of tensile load on tendon gel preserved for 10 days was investigated using a tensile test, a creep test, or a cycle test. In the tensile test, tendon gel was elongated into a thin cord of collagen fibers with an increase in stress, and the maximum diameter of the collagen fiber was approximately 50 times larger than that in the normal Achilles tendon of mice. The results suggest that the diameter of the oriented collagen fiber is controllable by adjusting the applied load and the time in mature tendon gel."

First, the distinction between Feng shui and Docham is vague. The second is the use of Feng Shui Jiri ideology as the logic of the transformation or reconstruction of the Goryeo dynasty, but there is no fundamental research on the theory. Fengshui is a traditional logic structure that organizes geographical facts based on the Yin-Yang theory and the O-hang theory of the five-line theory, and the subconscious idea is the sign and implication of future events.  From the above, it can not be identified from the basic logic. On the other hand, such Feng shui geography is closely related to the geographical location. The idea of Feng Shui Jiri is used as the king ""s sovereignty because it reveals that the harmonious period of man and nature is completed. This is a good example of the Hulrung at the Wulrung of Yegi.  In the following, I pointed out some of Lee""s accomplishments in the study trend of Feng Shui Jiri ideology. In the following, I pointed out some of Lee ""s accomplishments in the study trend of Feng Shui Jiri ideology. However, it can be seen that the use of Feng Shui is directly used when it shows the sacredness of Goryeo Taejo.   The following is about Samsonron. Lee Byung-do is the first to be raised in the Jongjong Daejeon by the municipal authorities of the militia, and it is looking for the dwindling of the royal family and frequent occurrence of ashes. However, it is reasonable to assume that Samso has been installed since the beginning of Goryeo because it was basically installed to complement the deficient portion of the capital city ""s openings. Finally, it is the use of geographical new law. The geography new law is a selfish wisdom. Lee Byeong-do and other researchers said that only Feng Shui-ji based on the model theory was used in the Goryeo period. However, the geography book was imported by the King""s strong demand at the beginning of Goryeo, and how to choose the funeral date of the King and the bureaucrats."

ice accretion on helicopter fuselage considering rotor-wake effects,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>To accurately predict the ice shape on the fuselage under rotor-wake effects, discrete modeling of individual tip vortices is essential to determine the local aerodynamic interactions between the vortex and the fuselage. To this end, the actuator surface model is developed and applied to the present study. Then, water-droplet-trajectory prediction, thermal analysis, and ice growth module are seamlessly integrated. This study aims to perform detailed analysis of the rotor downwash effects on ice that accretes on a helicopter fuselage and to determine the variation with respect to the forward flight speed. As a result of comprehensive numerical computations, the following conclusions are reached. First, the rotor inflow transforms the droplet trajectories, the location of ice accretion and the amount of ice are changed. Actually, 16.5% less ice is accumulated on the overall fuselage in the rotor-fuselage interaction case compared to the isolated fuselage case. Second, a clear-cut distinction of the icing locations on the fuselage is observed with various advance ratios. In hovering conditions, massive ice is accumulated on the tail-boom and fuselage nose region, where the tip vortices collide with fuselage. Due to the large collision area with high speed of droplets, 15.2 and 9.1% more ice is accumulated in hovering case than that of forward flight case with the advance ratio 0.075 and 0.15, respectively. However, as the forward speed grows from 0.15 to 0.2, the total mass of ice exponentially increases. In case of the advance ratio 0.2, 36% more ice is accumulated than that of the hovering case.</P>"

The scheduler selects the user with the largest instantaneous SNR normalized by the short-term average SNR. In normalized SNR scheduling, the coverage probability when the desired signal experiences Rayleigh fading is shown to be given by a series of Laplace transforms of the probability density function of interference. Also, a closed-form expression for the coverage probability is approximately achieved. The results confirm that normalized SNR scheduling increases the coverage probability due to the multi-user diversity gain.</P>"

To date, three distinct modes of genome editing technologies have been introduced and extensively investigated in experimental settings, and attempted for use in clinical settings. Despite the revolutionized efficiency and sophistication in gene editing owing to development of CRISPR/Cas9, there remains technical limitations for currently available programmable nucleases in the routine use in experimental and clinical settings. Here, we introduce a universal genome editing technology (UGET) that relies on gene targeting through simple base pairings between a 20-28 nt nucleotide probe and a stretch of single-strand target DNA at the replication fork. UGET has no target limitations, shows lower-than-expected off-target incidence, is straightforward to use, and is compatible to gene correction via HDR. In particular, an overall construct size is less than 2.3kb, which means a high flexibility for use in gene therapy using viral vectors including adenovirus-associated viruses as well as for agrobacterium-based transformation in plants."

For the cost-effective wave energy harvesting, it can be an effective measure to use existing breakwaters or newly installed breakwaters for both wave control and energy harvesting purposes. In this study, we investigated the functionality of both breakwater and wave-power generator for the oscillating water column (OWC)-type wave energy converter (WEC) installed in a pneumatic floating breakwater, which was originally developed as a floating breakwater. In order to verify the performance of the breakwater as a WEC, the air flow velocity from air-chamber to WEC has to be evaluated properly. Therefore, air flow velocity, wave transformation and motion of floating structure was numerically implemented based on BEM from linear velocity potential theory without considering the compressibility of air within the chamber. Air pressure, meanwhile, was assumed to be fluctuated by the motions of structure and the water level change within air-chamber. The validity of the obtained values can be determined by comparing the previous results from the numerical analysis for different shapes. Based on numerical model results, wave transformation characteristics around OWC system mounted on the fixed and floating breakwaters, and motions of the structure with air flow velocities are investigated. In summary, all numerical results are almost identical to the previous research considering air compressibility. Therefore, it can be concluded that this analysis not considering air compressibility in the air chamber is more efficient and practical method"

analytical and experimental investigation of partially covered piezoelectric cantilever energy harvester,2017,"['Vibration energy harvesting', 'Cellulose EAPap', 'Partially covered piezoelectric', 'Cantilever beam', 'Distributed parameter electromechanical model']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Electrical energy is normally generated through different sources such as hydroelectric, wind, heat, nuclear transformation, chemical reactions or vibrations. Nowadays, harvesting power from mechanical vibration is one of the novel technologies that usually can be done by systems based on electromagnetic, electrostatic, piezoelectric and combination of them. Piezoelectric systems can convert motion from the vibrating structures into electrical power. Cellulose Electro-active paper (EAPap) has been recognized as a novel smart piezoelectric material that can be used for energy harvesting purposes. One of the most prevalent method for vibration energy harvesting is using unimorph piezoelectric cantilever beams. In this paper, an analytical solution based on distributed parameter model is presented to calculate the generated energy from vibration of cantilever substrate that is partially covered by EAPap material. In the studied structure, piezoelectric layer thickness in comparison to the length of the beam and thickness of substrate material can be considered very thin. Thus its effect on the vibration behavior of structure is negligible. The results are validated by experimental values. The analytical data was found to be very close to experimental results and finite element simulation values.Findings from this study provide guidelines on system parameters that can be manipulated for more efficient performance in different ambient source conditions."

Why? According to Coase, where the cost of achieving a given outcome through the market mechanism will be higher than the cost of using a firm to achieve the same result, firms will emerge. This transaction cost theory may also explain why sharing economy companies are booming and in what aspects the peer production outperforms the market- and firm-based production processes. It is argued here that sharing economy has a systematic advantage over markets and firms in matching the best available human capital to the best available information inputs, and peer production system through the internet makes “an unbounded set of resources available to an unbounded set of agents, who can apply themselves toward an unbounded set of projects”. In the traditional companies, contributed resources for a project are typically pooled into one proprietary asset, and these contributions have transformed contributors` status into shareholders in the combined assets. But in peer production system, peer contributors are not required to transfer their property but only information about it. As a result, in a sharing economy company, there happens only pooling of information rather than proprietary pooling of the contributions themselves. As a result, the peer contributors will continue to control the assets as the owner. This phenomenon without asset partitioning and pooling is a quite unique from the perspectives of organizational law scholars and can be regarded as a great step forward from ownership-based to relationship-based society."

The paper proposes trajectory description techniques by using extremely smooth polynomial functions of time, which can describe point-to-point attitude maneuvers in a realizable and accurate manner with the help of unique FRA features. In addition, new controller design techniques using the FRAs are developed by combining the proposed interpolation techniques with a model predictive control framework. The proposed techniques are validated through their attitude control applications for an aggressive point-to-point maneuver. Conclusively, the FRAs provide much more flexibility than quaternions and Euler angles when describing kinematics, generating trajectories, and designing attitude controllers for spacecraft."

Parody is an imitation of a serious piece of literature, music, or composition for humorous or satirical effect. Parody can be recognized as a kind of creative works, but parodies, by its very nature, necessarily utilizes copyrighted works of others, and because the purpose for this use is satire and ridicule, there is tension between the parodist and copyright owner. As a result, some copyright owners are less than eager to see their work ridiculed and will not license their work for this purpose. Consequently, the parodist must rely on the defense of fair use in Copyright Law.The primary goal of this paper is to show how the Korean judiciary defines the meaning of parody and how parody is being protected by the copyright law through an analysis of a variety of precedents in developed country. Also, this paper talks about the limitations of the current copyright law in protecting parody and suggest some solutions to this issues.The finding show parody is loosely defined under the Copyright Law of Korea, making it more relevant to invoke the Article 28 of the copyright law on quotations and citations and the Article 22 that governs secondary works. For this reason, Korea’s judiciary system has a strong tendency to rely on the four factor ‘fair use’ test, which is widely used in the US legal system, to determine whether the use of a copyrighted work is fair.The findings also show the Korean judiciary system, which often applies the fair use principles too strictly to copyright cases, discourages parodists from creative works, hampering the advancement of human culture and knowledge. For instance, the judging panel has ruled “Combacom”, a song that changed the lyrics of Seo Tae-Ji’s popular song “Come Back Home”, violated the copyright law in that the new song just made fun of the original and failed to covey a new message. However, industry experts say the “parodied” song added creativity that the original had lacked and also carried a message of social criticism. If the expert’s views were fully taken into account according to the US Campbell decision, Combacom could have been regarded as a legitimate parody.In Campbell case, the US Supreme Court held that a commercial parody may quality as a fair use. To decide the question of fair use, the court must subject the parody to an overall balancing process in which the parody’s “transformative” character is more important than its commercial purpose. The focus should be on whether the work alters the original with new expression, meaning, and message.Therefore, in parody cases, judges must weigh the legitimate property interests of the copyright owner to control reproductions and derivative uses of his own work’s against parodist’s right to engage in freedom of speech and promote his art and the public benefit derived from parody.In Korea, a parody has been treated as a derivative work or a quotation, but a parody is not compatible with the theory of quotation or derivative work in some point. As a result of the above studies, this paper asserts to use the fair use principle as a way of resolving the infringement within the Korean Copyright Law regarding the parody.Fortunately, According to the Korean Copyright Act that was revised in 2011, parody is anticipated to be subject to the Fair Use Clause that has recently added."

In 2015, the U.S. California Court has dismissed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that it is a matter of fact for the jury to decide whether Uber and Lyft drivers are employees or independent contractors; that the companies have exercised certain degree of control over the drivers. In the meantime, the Seoul Administrative Court has ruled in 2015 that a teenage driver who provided delivery service via food-delivery app was not an employee under Korean Labor Standard Act as a matter of law, and is not entitled to labour law protection and industrial accident compensation.  While proponents of sharing economy insist that platform service providers are mere ‘users’ or their ‘partners’, one who looks at the economic reality of these workers could see that significant degree of control is exercised over them, albeit the use of platform or online application. In most cases, platform workers are exposed to long working hours, low pay, excessive emotional labor and precarious situation to maintain their living. These type of workers are in need of labour law protection just like any other employees in ordinary workplaces.  In the long term, our existing labour law standard on defining an “employee” should be enhanced and transformed in a way that better captures the nature of working conditions of the service providers in the sharing economy. This is ever more important in the 21C workplace where, as Prof. David Weil puts it, workplaces are being “fissured” and the use of platform work could be just another good excuse to “shed employment” in the face of deepening global inequality."
recursive update of channel information for reliable history matching of channel reservoirs using enkf with dct,2017,"['Recursive update of channel information', 'Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF)', 'Channel reservoirs', 'Discrete cosine transform (DCT)', 'Reservoir characterization']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is one of the promising reservoir characterization schemes for history matching. It has been widely researched due to its excellence in recursive data processing and dependable uncertainty quantification. However, EnKF has critical limitations for applying to non-Gaussian distribution fields such as channel reservoirs.</P> <P>In this study, we propose a novel scheme to characterize channel reservoirs reliably. The scheme, recursive update of channel information (RUCI), updates key channel information such as facies ratio and permeabilities of each rock facies as components of the state vector. Since permeabilities assimilated by EnKF follow a Gaussian distribution, EnKF itself is not adequate to preserve channel structure. To overcome this limitation, we use cumulative distribution function mapping to maintain its bimodal distribution. In addition to RUCI, discrete cosine transform (DCT) is utilized to preserve clear channel continuities by figuring out essential channel trend.</P> <P>The proposed method, RUCI in EnKF with DCT, is applied to three different channel reservoir cases and is compared with typical three methods: EnKF, EnKF with DCT, and EnKF with normal score transform (NST). Both of conventional EnKF and EnKF with DCT show overshooting and fail to present channel details. Furthermore, their permeability distributions have a tendency to follow a Gaussian, not a typical bimodal distribution of sand and shale. Even if EnKF with NST maintains a bimodal distribution after updates, it cannot figure out overall channel trend. The proposed method not only prevents overshooting but also preserves a bimodal distribution of permeability. It can clearly characterize true channel trend even though initial reservoir models are poorly made. In addition, it gives better estimation of future oil and water productions than the other 3 methods by reducing uncertainties and matching true performances.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  A novel scheme that updates channel information is suggested. </LI> <LI>  The proposed method integrates the scheme and DCT to characterize channel reservoirs. </LI> <LI>  It provides reliable characterization results by capturing true channel information and trends. </LI> </UL> </P>"

This study claims that the media and pollsters should have understood populism before they expressed regret at their inaccurate predictions, by presenting populism as an alternative hypothesis. This study demonstrates that none of the explanatory variables employed by traditional election models, such as misery index, candidate evaluation, policy evaluation, incumbent job approval rate, or low trust level, could have predicted Trump`s election. The rise of populism in the United States stems from an extreme fear that white workers experienced economic hardship under the overall decline of the American economy during the transforming process of the 4th industrial revolution. When successful business men abruptly turn into politicians, they are likely to be populists by mobilizing the emotional support of those who feel cynical towards politics, though mostly due to a paucity of political understanding. This study concludes that Trump was a populist candidate, whereas Bernie Sanders employed populist strategies, based on a comparative analysis of rhetoric of Trump and Sanders."

The network is made of two different integrated solutions for revealing deformations of the reference morphing structure. Strains are confined to typical values along the span (length) but they are expected to overcome standard ranges along the chord (width), up to almost 10%. In this case, suitable architectures may introduce proper modulations to keep the measured deformation low while preserving the information content. In the current paper, the designed monitoring system combines the use of a span-wise fiber reinforced patch with a chord-wise sliding beam. The two elements make up a closed grid, allowing the reconstruction of the complete deformed shape under the acceptable assumption that the transformation refers to regular geometry variations. Herein, the design logic and some integration issues are reported. Preliminary experimental test results are finally presented."

saturation power-based simple energy efficiency maximization schemes for miso broadcast channel systems,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>In this paper, we investigate an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem in multiple input single output broadcast channels. The optimization problem in this system model is difficult to solve in general, since it is in non-convex fractional form. Hence, conventional algorithms have addressed the problem in an iterative manner for each channel realization, which leads to high computational complexity. To tackle this complexity issue, we propose a new simple method by utilizing the fact that EE maximization becomes identical to spectral efficiency (SE) maximization for the region of the power below a certain transmit power termed as saturation power. In order to calculate the saturation power, we first introduce upper and lower bounds of the EE performance by adopting a maximal ratio transmission beamforming strategy. Then, we propose an efficient way to compute the saturation power for the EE maximization problem. Once we determine the saturation power in advance, we can transform the EE maximization problem into a simplified sub-optimal EE problem, which can be solved by the SE maximization schemes with low complexity. The derived saturation power is parameterized by employing random matrix theory, which relies only on the second-order channel statistics. Hence, this approach needs much lower computational complexity compared with a conventional scheme, which requires instantaneous channel state information. Numerical results validate that the proposed algorithm achieves near optimal EE performance with significantly reduced complexity.</P>"
robust stereo data cost with a learning strategy,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The performance of stereo matching algorithms strongly depends on the quality of the stereo data/matching cost. Most state-of-the-art data costs require expert knowledge for the design of a transformation function, such as census for handling gray-level changes monotonically, adaptive normalized cross correlation for handling Lambertian cases, guided filtering for preserving edge information, and local density encoding for handling illumination differences. However, it is difficult to design a complex transformation function to handle unknown factors that often occur in driving conditions such as snow, rain, and sun. Therefore, this paper has investigated the deep learning strategy to develop a novel stereo matching cost model without using much expert knowledge. Experimental results show that the proposed deep learning model obtains better results than the state-of-the-art stereo matching cost as judged by the standard KITTI benchmark, Middlebury, and HCI datasets.</P>"

The electromagnetic damper is composed of a permanent-magnet DC motor, a ball screw and a nut. The main objective of the current work is to reduce the pipe vibration resulting from the fluid velocity and allow it to transform into electric energy. To pursue this goal, the stability and vibration of the beam model was studied using Ritz and Newmark methods. It was observed that increasing the fluid velocity results in a decrease in the motion of the free end of the pipe. The results of simulation showed that the designed semiactive electromagnetic damper controlled by on-off damping control strategy decreased the vibration amplitude of the pipe about 5.9% and regenerated energy nearly 1.9 (mJ/s).

IT 기술의 발달 뿐만 아니라 문화산업 을 육성하기 위한 각국의 치열한 경쟁으로 인하여 산업환경과 발전전략은 크게 변화하고 있으며, 이 러한 변화되는 환경에 맞게 그리고 미래시장을 선 점하기 위해 새로운 전략이 수립되어야 하고 법률도 적극적으로 이를 뒷받침해야 할 것이다.  이러한 측면에서 1950년대에 미국에서 시작한 퍼블리시티권 이론은 미국의 문화산업을 발전시 키는데 있어서 중요한 역할을 해왔다. 비록 그 범위가 모호하고 알권리 등 타인의 권리를 지나치게 제한한다는 비판도 많지만, 유명인의 고객흡인력 즉 퍼블리시티권을 활용한 새로운 비즈니스 모델 들이 발달하면서 현재 헐리우드 산업, 그리고 미국의 문화산업을 만들어왔다고 해도 과언이 아니 다. 우리나라에서는 1985년 이휘소 사건에서 처 음 퍼블리시티권이 다루어진 이후로 퍼블리시티 권의 각종 쟁점들을 다루는 판결들이 계속 나오고 있다. 이러한 판결들은 우리나라 문화산업의 구조와 관련된 각종 쟁점들을 짚어내면서 사회적으로도 상당한 주목을 받았으며, 한편으로 많은 논문 들이 퍼블리시티권에 대한 이론적인 근거를 제공하면서 퍼블리시티권의 범위는 계속 확장되었다. 최근 법원이 아직 성문법이 제정되지 않았음을 지적하며 퍼블리시티권을 부인하고 기존의 인격권 법리를 재산권적 요소에까지 확장해서 해결하는 판례들을 내놓고 있지만, 초상권의 기본적인 성격은 인격권에 기초한 소극적 청구권이라는 점에서 양도나 상속 등의 문제에 있어서 제3자에게 대해서 경제적인 권리를 안정적으로 주장하는 데에는 이론적으로도 실무적으로도 여러 가지 어려움들 이 있다.  퍼블리시티권은 태생적으로 타인의 권리들과 의 충돌을 예정하고 있다. 퍼블리시티권을 자기 동일성의 가치를 타인이 허락없이 사용하는 것을 통제하는 권리라고 정의하는 순간부터 이를 이용 하려는 타인과 충돌은 불가피하고, 이런 충돌 속 에서 퍼블리시티권은 이론적으로도 계속 발전해 왔다. 물론 타인의 동일성 가치를 이용하는 모든 경우에 퍼블리시티권의 침해가 인정되는 것은 아 닐 것이다. 오히려 비록 상업적인 이용의 성격을 가진다고 하더라도 타인의 정당한 권리행사로 보호받아야 할 경우가 있으며, 따라서 이러한 결론 을 뒷받침하기 위한 논리의 발달도 필요하다. 미국이나 일본의 많은 판례와 학설들은 충돌하는 권리들 사이의 우열관계를 따져 보기도 했고 또는 두 권리가 서로 양보하면서 공존할 수 있는 길을 모색해 보기도 했다. 이러한 판례와 학설들의 노력들이 지금의 퍼블리시티권의 모습을 만들어 온 것이다. 퍼블리시티권은 특히 헌법상 표현의 자유와 여러 가지 면에서 충돌을 일으켜왔다. 미국에서는 전통적으로 수정헌법 제1조 즉, 표현의 자유의 우 월성이 강조되었고 이에 상업적 이용 기준, 뉴스 가치 기준 등이 제시되었다. 그리고 두 권리를 둘 러싼 이해관계들을 고려하여 더욱 타당한 결론을 이끌어내기 위해서 다양한 시도들이 있어왔으며 이에 지배적 이용 기준, Rogers Test, 변형적 이 용 기준 등이 제시되었다. 일본에서도 퍼블리시티 권과 표현의 자유가 충돌하는 상황을 해결하기 위 하여 법원의 판례를 중심으로 오로지 기준설, 상업적 이용설, 종합 고려설 등이 논의되어왔고, 최 근 일본 최고재판소는 핑크레이디 사건에서 오로 지 기준설을 취하면서 그 세부적인 침해유형을 “① 초상 등 그 자체를 독립하여 감상의 대상이 되는 상품 등으로서 사용하거나, ② 상품 등을 차 별화할 목적으로 초상 등을 상품에 붙이거나, ③ 초상 등을 상품의 광고로써 사용하는지” 등 세 가지로 나누어 제시하고 있다. 그동안 우리나라에서는 퍼블리시티권과 관련 하여 많은 논의가 있어왔지만, 지금까지는 주로 인정여부나 성질, 주체와 객체 등 효력 범위 등에 대한 논의가 주류를 이루었고, 타인의 권리와의 관계에서 퍼블리시티권을 어디까지 인정할 것인 지의 한계에 대한 논의는 별로 없었다. 과거 우리 나라 판례들은 유명인사의 초상 등을 광고 등에 무단 사용된 경우에 초상권 이론에 기초하여 ‘수 인가능성’ 여부로 판단해왔다. 그리고 퍼블리시티 권 법리가 본격적으로 등장한 이후에는 소설 등에 이용은 ‘상업적 이용’에 해당하지 않는다는 일련의 판례들이 나왔다. 그 후 판례들도 점차 권리 충돌과 관련된 제반 이익들을 비교형량하고 있고 이러한 고려 요소들은 계속 확장되는 추세이다. 최근에는 일본의 핑크레이디 판결에 나타난 판단 기 준을 그대로 도입하여 “① 초상 등 그 자체를 독 립하여 감상의 대상이 되는 상품 등으로서 사용하 거나, ② 상품 등을 차별화할 목적으로 초상 등을 상품에 붙이거나, ③ 초상 등을 상품의 광고로써 사용하는지” 여부를 기준으로 판단하는 사례들이 잇달아 나오고 있다. 하지만 일본 핑크레이디 판 결은 완결적인 판단기준이 아닐 뿐만 아니라 특히 우리나라에 마땅한 근거규정도 찾을 수 없다는 한계가 있다. 따라서 최근에 도입된 저작권법상 공 정이용(fair use)의 법리를 유형적 형량기준의 하 나로 적극적으로 고려할 필요가 있다.  퍼블리시티권과 표현의 자유 등 다른 권리와의 충돌문제는 앞으로도 계속될 것이며, 따라서 이러한 퍼블리시티권의 한계 문제는 추후 새로운 법률 이나 대법원의 판결을 통해 정리될 수도 있다. 하지만 법률이 제정되거나 대법원 판결이 있다고 해 서 퍼블리시티권과 관련된 이익충돌 상황이 자동적으로 혹은 일거에 해결되지는 않을 것이다. 따라서 헌법의 틀 안에서 표현의 자유의 중요성을 유지하면서도 개인의 동일성 가치를 보전할 수 있는 해석기준을 정립하고 이에 터잡아 다양한 사례들이 뒷받침된다면 양자의 충돌을 조화롭게 해결할 수 있는 구체적 타당성과 예측가능성이 높은 기준이 될 수 있을 것이다.","Recently, with the advancement of information technology, including the Internet and social network services, the cultural industry and contents industry are also developing at a remarkable speed. Riding the so-called “Korean Wave,” Korean films, dramas and music are gaining huge popularity not just in Japan, China and Southeast Asia, but throughout the world, including Europe and South America. Consequently, cultural industry in Korea is seen as one of the most promising industries and is expected to develop further. At the heart of the cultural industry are famous actors and singers, and the popularity and attention on such celebrities play a central role in the development of the cultural industry. Strong competition in each country to foster their cultural industry, as well as the advancement of information technology, is drastically reshaping the environment surrounding the industry and its growth strategy. In order to dominate the market in the future, new strategies for this changing environment should be established and laws and regulations also need to support them.  In this respect, the right of publicity, which has been recognized in the United States since the 1950s, has played an important role in the development of the American cultural industry. Although there are criticisms that the scope of the right of publicity is vague and it overly limit the rights of others, such as the right to know, it is no exaggeration to say that ever-evolving new business models utilizing the right of publicity have established the Hollywood industry as it is now. In Korea, since the right of publicity was first discussed in Benjamin W. Lee case in 1985, there have been many cases dealing with various issues of the right of publicity. These cases received considerable attention as they dealt with issues related to the fabric of the Korean cultural industry. On the other hand, the scope of the right of publicity continued to expand as many articles provided theoretical grounds. The Korean courts are dismissing the right of publicity claims, pointing out that there is no legislation recognizing the right of publicity, while expanding the application of personal rights in their judgment. However, since the claim for right of likeness is, in its nature, a passive claim based on personal rights, there are many theoretical and practical difficulties to take it as a base to make an economic claim against a third party.  The right of publicity is destined to be in conflict with the rights of others. Since the right of publicity is defined as the right of each individual to control others from using the value of his or her own identity without permission, it is inevitable to conflict with others who desire to use it, and it is in this conflict that the right of publicity has continued to evolve. However, infringement of the right of publicity cannot be recognized in all cases where the value of an individual’s identity is used by others. Rather, the legitimate use of it by others should be protected, even if it is for commercial purposes. Therefore, we need also to develop a rationale to sufficiently protect such legitimate uses. In many judicial precedents and doctrines in the United States and Japan, the relationship between the conflicting rights has been examined and there have been discussions to find a way for the two rights to coexist. Such efforts base on these precedents and doctrines have shaped what we now perceive as publicity rights.  The right of publicity, in particular, has caused conflicts in many aspects with the freedom of expression recognized under the Constitution. In the United States, where the superiority of freedom of speech is prioritized, the commercial use and newsworthiness standards have been introduced. In addition, in an attempt to draw more valid conclusions considering the interests of the two rights, many criteria, such as the dominant use standard and the Rogers Test have been presented. In Japan, there have been discussions on the limitations of publicity rights, from which many theories, including but not limited to, “important part standard” theory, “only standard” theory, and comprehensive consideration theory have been derived. Recently, the Supreme Court of Japan has applied the only standard theory in the Pink Lady case, classifying the types of infringement into the following categories: (i) cases where a likeness of a person is used as a product to be independently appreciated; (ii) cases where a likeness of a person is attached to a product to differentiate such product from other products; and (iii) cases where a likeness of a person is used as part of an advertisement of a product.  There have also been many discussions on the right of publicity in Korea. However, the discussions were mainly restricted to the validity or the effective scope of publicity rights, such as the nature and subject/object of the right of publicity, and there was little discussion about the extent to which the right of publicity is recognized. Meanwhile, in case where a likeness of a celebrity was used in an advertisement without permission, the Korean court in the past made a decision based on the acceptability standard under the likeness theory. In the wake of the introduction of publicity rights theories, a series of judgments found that the use of publicity in novels does not constitute a “commercial use.” Since then, the Korean courts have taken into consideration various conflicting interests and increasing number of factors are considered by the courts these days. In recent years, the Korean courts have adopted the following judgment criteria used in the Pink Lady case in Japan: (i) whether a likeness of a person is used as a product to be independently appreciated; (ii) whether a likeness of a person is attached to a product to differentiate such product from other products; and (iii) whether a likeness of a person is used as part of an advertisement of a product.  The conflict between the publicity right and other rights will continue in the future, and it is possible that the scope of the right of publicity will be determined by a new legislation or the decision by the Korean Supreme Court. However, not all conflicts of interests related to the right of publicity can be resolved by a new regulation or the Supreme Court decisions. Therefore, we need to formulate more exquisite and plausible standards based on various cases so far accumulated and existing interpretation theories."

Unfortunately, there might be a loss of information because the BPR model considers only the binary transformation of implicit feedback that is non-binary data in most cases.We propose a modified BPR method using a level of confidence based on the size or strength of implicit feedback to overcome this limitation. The proposed method is useful because it still has a structure of interpretable models for underlying personalized ranking i.e., personal pairwise preferences as in the BPR and that it is capable to reflect a numerical size or the strength of implicit feedback. We propose a computation algorithm based on stochastic gradient descent for the numerical implementation of our proposal. Furthermore, we also show the usefulness of our proposed method compared to ordinary BPR via an analysis of steam video games data."

The Korean regional development strategy that has centered massive resources on a particular region has led it grow and become a big city, inducing large migration of the rural population to the city. Experiencing hollow villages due to out-migration of the rural population, at the same time, the aging of the rural areas and the lack of basic infrastructure facilities have been threatening the existence of rural areas. Technological advances from the fourth industrial revolution can alternatively reverse this experience, revitalizing rural areas and resolving spatial and regional inequality between urban and rural areas. This is possible if the fourth industrial revolution contributes to alleviating the disparity of regional utility between urban and rural areas. If successful, it is highly expected that population migrating to a city as a result of the utility difference will experience reverse migration to rural areas. In addition, IoT and 3D-printing technologies will expand the flow of goods and service, which was mostly constrained by physical space, to the non-physical space; these technologies will lead contribute to increasing both the utility of urban and rural areas. To prepare the new era of digital transformation, local and central governments as well as other private firms and stakeholders need to collaborate for the future regional development strategies."

A pastor’s missionary vision can be the driving force in transforming the Korean Diaspora Church from a traditional church to a missional one, which can be achieved by the pastor’s greater involvement in missionary activities. This year’s Dubai Ministry Festival was a community of practice and learning, with the goal of rediscovering the calling of Korean Diaspora pastors. The purpose of this study is to explore the Dubai Ministry Festival as a community of practice and analyze and interpret the learning experiences of pastors by applying integrated research methods. According to the survey results (N=74), the Dubai Ministry Festival was most effective for “the group of 10-20 years (ministry period) in the 40s (age)” and showed an interaction effect between the age and the ministry period in learning experiences. There was a very high level of correlation among the four components of learning in a community of practice, and the more effective “learning as doing” was, the more effective the learning of the other components was. In addition, according to the results of the causal chain analysis of factors influencing learning experiences, the factors related to “learning as becoming” mainly promoted learning, while the factors related to “learning as doing” interfered with learning. It is difficult to generalize the results of this study because it is a one-time festival with limited participants. However, it is suggested alternative models of education for pastors at the heart of the church crisis and reform, which could include creating a learning community and designing a platform for church renewal and collaboration."

In particular, Lee, Bae (2014) transformed the Hellinger function used as a distance estimator of the parametric model by Beran (1977) into the Hellinger measure and applied it for the first time to generate association rules. But it is difficult to grasp the direction of association. To solve this problem, Park (2016a) proposed a modified Hellinger measure. In this paper, we proposed an adjusted pure Hellinger measure with conditional probability to take into account the purity of the association instead of the marginal probability of lift used in the modified Hellinger measure, and examined the conditions for association threshold. We also examined the changing aspects of the three types of Hellinger measures according to the coincidence frequency and the inconsistency frequency. As a result, the adjusted pure Hellinger measure proposed in this paper was more effective than the conventional Hellinger measure and the modified Hellinger measure because the adjusted pure Hellinger measure proposed in this paper not only showed the direction of the association but also had the greatest variation of the value."
dynamic optimal output feedback control of satellite formation reconfiguration based on an lmi approach,2017,"['Dynamic optimal controller', 'Elimination method', 'Graph theory', 'Linear matrix inequality (LMI)', 'Output feedback control (OFC)', 'Satellite formation flying']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>This study presents a dynamic quadratic-optimal (DQO) output feedback controller for satellite formation reconfiguration based on a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. A relative motion model involving communication topology of formation flying on a circular reference orbit is established through graph theory. As the design of a static quadratic-optimal (SQO) output feedback controller was determined to be infeasible, emphasis is placed on designing a DQO output feedback controller. Introducing an impulse function enables us to transform the original DQO output feedback control (DQO-OFC) problem into an optimal L<SUB>2</SUB>-norm problem, which can be solved in the standard frame of an LMI approach. It is infeasible to employ a conventional substitution method to treat a nonlinear term with a quadratic form. Thus, an elimination method is adopted in order to address nonlinear terms in the matrix inequalities to obtain a set of equivalent LMIs. Additional control quantities are developed in order to retain the formation configuration in a non-zero state. Simulation results demonstrate validity and functionality of the proposed DQO output feedback controller.</P>"

phosphate enhanced abiotic and biotic arsenic mobilization in the wetland rhizosphere,2017,"['Arsenic', 'Phosphate', 'Mobility', 'Wetland', 'Rhizosphere', 'Iron reduction', 'Arsenic reduction', 'Microbial community']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Although abiotic process of competitive sorption between phosphate (P) and arsenate (As(V)), especially onto iron oxides, are well understood, P-mediated biotic processes of Fe and As redox transformation contributing to As mobilization and speciation in wetlands remain poorly defined. To gain new insights into the effects of P on As mobility, speciation, and bioavailability in wetlands, well-controlled greenhouse experiments were conducted. As expected, increased P levels contributed to more As desorption, but more interestingly the interactions between P and wetland plants played a synergistic role in the microbially-mediated As mobilization and enhanced As uptake by plants. High levels of P promoted plant growth and the exudation of labile organic carbon from roots, enhancing the growth of heterotrophic bacteria, including As and Fe reducers. This in turn resulted in both, more As desorption into solution due to reductive iron dissolution, and a higher fraction of the dissolved As in the form of As(III) due to the higher number of As(V) reducers. Consistent with the dissolved As results, arsenic-XANES spectra from solid medium samples demonstrated that more As was sequestered in the rhizosphere as As(III) in the presence of high P levels than for low P levels. Hence, increased P loading to wetlands stimulates both abiotic and biotic processes in the wetland rhizosphere, resulting in more As mobilization, more As reduction, as well as more As uptake by plants. These interactions are important to be taken into account in As fate and transport models in wetlands and management of wetlands containing As.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  Increased PO<SUB>4</SUB> <SUP>3−</SUP> loading to wetlands stimulates abiotic and biotic As mobilization. </LI> <LI>  Increased PO<SUB>4</SUB> <SUP>3−</SUP> loading results in more As-reducing bacteria in wetland sediments. </LI> <LI>  Increased PO<SUB>4</SUB> <SUP>3−</SUP> loading results in more As reduction in wetland sediments. </LI> <LI>  Increased PO<SUB>4</SUB> <SUP>3−</SUP> loading results in more As uptake by wetland plants. </LI> <LI>  Increased PO<SUB>4</SUB> <SUP>3−</SUP> loading to wetlands results in lower ORP and less Fe reduction. </LI> </UL> </P>"
effects of steam introduction on deactivation of fe-bea catalyst in nh3-scr of n2o and no,2017,"['N2O reduction', 'NH3-SCR', 'Fe-BEA', 'DRIFTS', 'SCC-DFTB method']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The effects of water vapor on the catalytic activity of a Fe-BEA catalyst in the NH3-SCR reaction for N2Oand NO were investigated using diffusive reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS)tests and SCC-DFTB calculation. It was found that water vapor only decreased the N2O conversion rate anddid not affect the conversion rates of NO. The DRIFTS analysis revealed that the presence of waterincreased the adsorption strength of nitrous oxide (N2O) on the catalyst surface. On the other hand, nitricoxide (NO) conversion route was only altered from NO2-SCR to standard selective catalytic reduction(SCR) upon injection of water vapor. It was confirmed that the water vapor not only inhibited thedesorption of N2O during the reduction step but also induced stronger adsorption of N2O during the NH3-SCR reaction.

In this study, transformational leadership is posited as an antecedent variable to the effects of micro-boundary spanning among government officers. A survey research was conducted with 450 government officers in Korea. Findings suggest that the quality of government officers’relationships can lead to a greater likelihood of performing micro-boundary spanning in and around the organization as the three organizational factors become well-established. In a similar vein, managers’transformational leadership can also be a meaningful driver of promoting micro-boundary spanning as the organizational climate is innovative and adaptive to creativity. The author discusses important theoretical and managerial implications regarding the role of government officers’internal communication and organization-public relationship in building and sustaining socio-cultural assets and individual capacity in government organizations."

In many cases, ART has transformed their intentions to have children. The present study aimed to assess changes in fertility intentions 12 months after ART initiation among HIV-positive women in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: An institution-based follow-up study was conducted among 360 HIV-positive women in Addis Ababa. A logistic regression model was used to assess the influence of socio-demographic, reproductive health, and clinical characteristics on changes in the fertility intentions of women. RESULTS: Overall, 40.8% (147 of 360) of the women reported that they desired to have a child in the future at the baseline visit, while 48.3% (174 of 360) did so at the 12-month follow-up. The proportion of women who reported that they desired to have a child 12 months after ART initiation was higher among ART-initiated women (55.8%, 106 of 190) than ART-naïve women (40.0%, 68 of 170). The adjusted analysis indicated that a change in fertility intentions between baseline and the follow-up visit was significantly associated with ART use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20 to 5.20) and marital status, with single (aOR, 5.33; 95% CI, 1.10 to 25.92) and married (aOR, 6.35; 95% CI, 1.44 to 27.99) women being more likely to report fertility intentions than divorced/widowed women. CONCLUSIONS: ART use was a significant predictor of change in fertility intentions between the baseline and follow-up visit, which suggests that additional efforts are necessary to integrate family planning and HIV services to address the safe fertility goals of women in the study area."

As Malaysia is currently still in the starting phase of LEP 2.0, it is important to review the first phase of LEP to fully understand its limitations and weaknesses existent in it, so as to better understand how certain regional transformations should be incorporated into the new wave successfully. This paper argues that the first wave of LEP showed pro-Japan biasness rather than a relatively balanced approach toward both Japan and Korea. The bilateral ties of Malaysia-Japan outweighed those between Malaysia-Korea, as indeed, the former Prime Minister`s pro-Japanese inclination affected the full outcome of LEP. In other words, Mahathir`s pro-Japanese stance produced a largely neglected attitude toward Korea. Therefore, despite all the achievements and fruitful results of the LEP, the program still had inherent weaknesses. The ongoing changing global scenarios and the importance of Asian regionalism, however, has now pushed Malaysia to announce the LEP 2.0 under Prime Minister Najib`s administration."

Based on the capillary model, this relation was transformed to the friction equivalent permeability (FEP) definition. The validity of the FEP definition was confirmed by means of comparison with the Kozeny-Carman equation. Hereby, it was shown that the FEP definition is the generalized form of the Kozeny-Carman equation, which is confined to laminar flow through a circular capillary.

Secondly, the sliding mode observeris designed to estimate the decoupled disturbances and system states of nonlinear systems. The coupled disturbancecan be reconstructed hereafter. The detailed methods of designing the observer, together with the sufficientcondition to guarantee the existence of the observer are also given. Finally, a simulation and a robot manipulatorexperiment are provided to examine the validity of the proposed design approach."
hybrid reliability analysis method for electromagnetic design problems with non-gaussian probabilistic parameters,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>This paper proposes an efficient and stable reliability analysis method for reliability-based electromagnetic design problems with non-normal probability distributions of input parameters. The reliability analysis strongly depends on distribution types of random variables since nonlinear transformations between an original random space and a standard normal random space cause additional nonlinearity into the reliability assessment of probabilistic constraint functions. That can lead to numerical inaccuracy and instability in the reliability-based design process, or may fail to have a solution to the probabilistic constraint assessment. To overcome these difficulties, a hybrid mean-value method is introduced to seeking a most probable failure point in the performance measure approach, which is one of the first-order reliability analysis methods. The proposed method is tested with a mathematical model and a loudspeaker design, of which random variables are assumed to follow five different probability distributions case by case.</P>"

In the 1960s, Korea was transitioning to mass society with the rapid development of mass media, in the course of which female images were frequently used. Alongside the organization of mass media of the 1960s, the dominant discourse of the time was the modernization of an agricultural community for which the government magazine『Saenongmin』supported the idea. The study examines the role of mass media through the use of a magazine in the 1960s and analyzes changes in the covers of『Saenongmin』in order to investigate how women were represented and examine its meaning in accordance with the changes of the magazine. As for the method of study, literature research was conducted to theoretically examine social backgrounds of the time followed by the examination of the magazine『Saenongmin』; the covers of the total of 99 issues from the first issue of october 1961 to the final of december 1969. As a result of the analysis, the image of women that appeared in the cover of『Saenongmin』in the 1960s was divided into a female farmer(the first period), a female celebrity playing a role of a farmer(the second period), and a female fashion model(the third period). The images of women were used to disseminate the image of ideal new farmers based on realistic female farmers in the first period, to effectively spread governmental policies of agricultural modernization on the back of public support in the second period, and to disseminate trends as the magazine was transformed into mass media subscribed by general public in the third period respectively. This study showed that the female images represented in the covers of the magazine changed according to the contemporary discourses and were embodied as corresponding images."

In fact we analyse tourism profitability, compatibility and sustainability by using bifurcation theory in terms of structural properties of attractors of system. For this purpose first we transformed it into a three dimensional system such that the reduced system is the extended and modified model of the previous three dimensional models suggested for tourism with the same dimension. Then we investigate transcritical, pitchfork and saddle-node bifurcation points of system. And numerically by finding some branches of stable equilibria for system show the profitability of tourism industry. Then by determining the Hopf bifurcation points of system we find a family of stable attractors for that by numerical techniques. Finally we conclude the existence of these stable limit cycles implies profitability and compatibility and then the sustainability of tourism."

While one literary appraisal, that Mujeong showed the narrative model of a national representation, and its opposite opinion competed with each other, there was the other literary appraisal which kept asking the reason why the liberalism of Lee Gwangsu could not help failing all the time in the Korean society. These two literary viewpoints seem to cross each other in the literary circle. However, the critical discussions on post-nationalism are brought up on quite a large scale recently. In recalling that the literary status of Mujeong had been frequently adjusted by the interpretative narrative of the time and the conditions of subjectivity also had been transformed during its adjustment, it is needed to consider a critical argument surrounding nationalism and the theory of nation-state. In the middle of examining the trajectory of literary interpretation which is developed and coexisted in accord with the time and generations, this paper tried to understand the way of existence of Mujeong in the present situation on which ‘the literary history’ is not possible any more."

This study thus investigates a mechanism in which market information obtained through agents is interpreted, transformed and applied for decision making and presents outcomes. In particular, the study focuses on the mediating role of adaptive capability on the relationship between market information management and export performance.Design/methodology/approach – Drawing upon the theories of knowledge-based view and contingency paradigm, a research model is developed for linking the key constructs of foreign agent operations, information management, adaptive capability and performance. Structural equation modeling is applied for testing the model using data collected from a sample of 152 Korean SME exporters.Findings – The results indicate that a firm’s operation quality of foreign agents strongly affects the quality of market information management which consequently impacts export performance. In the relationship between market information management and export performance, in particular, adaptive capability is found to play a mediating role. This implies that export performance is, for the most part, achieved by the mediation of adaptive capability, although market information leads directly to export performance to some degree. The results also confirm the existence of reciprocal causation between a firm’s export performance and foreign agent operations. The finding suggests that the outcome of SME export performance continues to provide feedback to its operations of foreign agents and consistently influence each other.Originality/value – This study makes an important contribution to the body of export literature by identifying the mediating effects of adaptive capability on the relationship between market information management and export performance. In addition, the results create a recursive model for SME export performance by verifying the reciprocal relationship between export performance and operating with agents. This study thus helps extend understanding of international operations through foreign agents in the SME context."

protein mixture segregation at coffee-ring: real-time imaging of protein ring precipitation by ftir spectromicroscopy,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>During natural drying process, all solutions and suspensions tend to form the so-called 'coffee-ring' deposits. This phenomenon, by far, has been interpreted by the hydrodynamics of evaporating fluids. However, in this study, by applying Fourier transform infrared imaging (FTIRI), it is possible to observe the segregation and separation of a protein mixture at the 'ring', hence we suggest a new way to interpret 'coffee-ring effect' of solutions. The results explore the dynamic process that leads to the ring formation in case of model plasma proteins, such as BGG (bovine ? globulin), BSA (bovine serum albumin), and Hfib (human fibrinogen), and also report fascinating discovery of the segregation at the ring deposits of two model proteins BGG and BSA, which can be explained by an energy kinetic model, only. The investigation suggests that the coffee-ring effect of solute in an evaporating solution drop is driven by an energy gradient created from change of particle-water-air interfacial energy configuration.</P>"
local delivery of ctgf sirna with poly(sorbitol-co-pei) reduces scar contraction in cutaneous wound healing,2017,"['Connective tissue growth factor', 'Poly(sorbitol-co-PEI)', 'siRNA', 'Scar contraction', 'Wound healing']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Healing process in scarring inevitably produces a considerable amount of non-organized dense collagen-rich matrix called scar thus impairing the native structure of skin. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) overexpression within healing tissues is known to play an imperative role in collagen production stimulated by transforming growth factor-beta in cutaneous wound healing. Undoubtedly, the knockdown of CTGF expression through siRNA-mediated gene silencing could simply impede the scarring process. However, the less stability and low transfection of siRNAs themselves urge a safe carrier to protect and transfect them into cells at a high rate avoiding toxicities. Here, we developed a degradable poly(sorbitol-co- PEI) (PSPEI), prepared by polymerization of sorbitol diacrylate with low molecular weight polyethylenimine, which has high transfection efficiency but low cytotoxicity, and utilized it in siCTGF delivery to silence the expression of CTGF in an animal model of cutaneous wound healing. Unlike contracted scar in normal healing, there was no or less contraction in the healed skin of mice treated with siCTGF using PSPEI. Histologically, the healed tissues also had distinct papillary structures and dense irregular connective tissues that were lacking in the control scar tissues. This study exemplifies a successful treatment of cutaneous wound healing using a polymer system coupled with RNA interference. Hence, the approach holds a great promise for developing new treatments with novel targets in regenerative medicines."

Here, six B. distachyon MSR (BdMSR) genes have been isolated; they generate eight distinct cDNAs, since two of them (BdMSRB1 and -B5) produce a pair of alternatively spliced messages. The genes were transcribed in the root, culm, leaf and during various stages of caryopsis development. Those induced by abiotic stress (salinity, drought, low temperature, CdCl2, H2O2 and abscisic acid) harbored known stress-responsive cis elements in their promoter sequences. The heterologous expression of five of the BdMSRs (-A2, -A4, -B1.1, -B3 and -B5.1) in yeast revealed that their products gave a measure of protection against salinity, mannitol and oxidative stress. Substrate specificity analysis revealed that BdMSRB1.1 could reduce free Met-R-SO to Met. The enzymatic activities of BdMSRA4, -B1.1 and -B5.1 in transformed yeast under salt treatment have checked and increased obviously resulting in reducing more Met-SO to Met including the peptide and the free types under salt stress than those in control."

The complex Fourier transform is applied to governing equation to derive a system of singular integral equations with Cauchy type kernel. These equations are solved by a numerical method to obtain the stress intensity factors (SIFs) at the crack tips. The effects of non-homogeneity parameters for exponentially and linearly form of shear modulus, the thickness of the layers and the length of crack on the SIFs for several interface cracks are investigated. The results reveal that the magnitude of SIFs decrease with increasing of FG parameter and thickness of FGM layer.

The subjects are 274 pieces of porcelain and 118 pieces of pottery such as celadon and white porcelain excavated from the 166th tomb of 41 ruins in Gyeongi-do, Chungcheong-do, Jeolla-do and Gyeongsang-do. There are 2 stone chamber tombs, 126 stone outer coffin tombs, 126 pit tombs. The stone outer coffin tombs showed the local standard deviation, accounting for approx. 80% in Chungcheong area. The artifacts were classified by type and feature, based on which, the sequence revealed by seriation method was applied more specifically to chronological forms and features.  As a result, it was divided into two periods. The first period is chronologically estimated between the foundation of Goryeo and the early 11th century, and various types of tombs coexist, including a stone outer coffin tomb and pit tomb along with the stone chamber. The artifacts excavated from the tombs in the first period are limited to a certain type of basic celadons such as plate, cup, and Yu-byeong(oil bottle), all of which were produced at the stage of brick-built kiln including the pre Haemuri-gup and transitional Haemuri-gup. Pottery shows a variety of forms such as bottle and feet affected by the earthenware and metalware of the Unified Shilla era. In other words, the porcelain of the first period coexisted with the pottery influenced by the Unified Silla period and porcelain by Yuezhouyao in China, not fully divided. Also a relatively large amount of Chinese celadon were imported and used in such period.  In the second period from the early 11th century to late Goryeo, a more variety of ceramics such as bowl, plate and cup were produced in form of Korean style Haemuri-gup and modified Haemuri-gup while the production of tea utensils increased. On the other hand, pottery is limited to a simple model like bottle. Referring to this trend, during the second period it is found that the functional differentiation of pottery and porcelain was established to some extent and the production of porcelain increased. In addition, various patterns increasingly were engraved on the porcelain, e.g., the semicircle pattern engraved on the upper part, and lotus carved on the bottom, simple form of vine pattern or engraved lotus petal pattern.  These changes stemmed from establishment of the new manufacturing system and a broad range of consumers, promoting the expansion of the tea culture as well as the consumption of tea utensils, and providing the driving force for celadon production. The increase in the production of domestic ceramics has naturally reduced the import of Chinese ceramics.  It was an opportunity to observe the changes of ceramics in the early Goryeo through the ceramics excavated from the tombs of the early Goryeo."
금강 백제보 구간 수온성층 형성과 임계유속 관계,2017,"['Algal bloom', 'Baekje Weir', 'Critical flow velocity', 'EFDC', 'Thermal stratification']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In Geum River of Korea, three multi-purpose weirs were built at the downstream of Daecheong Reservoir during the Four Major River Restoration Project (FMRRP). The weirs have altered the hydraulic characteristics of the river, and consequently transformed the large areas of flowing ecosystem to deep and wide stagnant environment. In every summer, a thermal stratification occurred near the Baekje Weir having mean depth of 4.0 m, and the surface algal blooms dominated by buoyant cyanobacteria have been frequently formed after the FMRRP. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between flow velocity and thermal stability of the waterbody using a three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic model (EFDC+) after calibration against the thermistor chain data obtained in 2014. A new Sigma-Zed vertical grid system of EFDC+ that minimize the pressure gradient errors was used to better simulate the thermodynamics of the waterbody. The model reasonably simulated the vertical profiles of the observed water temperatures. The vertical mean flow velocity and the Richardson Number (Ri) that represents the stability of waterbody were estimated for various management water levels and flow rates scenarios. The results indicated that the thermal stability of the waterbody is mostly high ($Ri{\gg}0.25$) enough to establish stratification, and largely depend on the flow velocity. The critical flow velocity that can avoid a persistent thermal stratification was found to be approximately 0.1 m/s."

Analytical and numerical techniques based on Laplace transforms and their inversions are used to calculate the vibrational deflection and temperature of the nanobeam. The effects of the PLs and ramping-time parameters on the lateral vibration, the temperature, the displacement and the flexure moment of the nanobeam are investigated.

strategies to extend thrombolytic time window for ischemic stroke treatment: an unmet clinical need,2017,"['Tissue plasminogen activator', 'Hemorrhage', 'Vasculature', 'Blood-brain barrier']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"To date, reperfusion with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) remains the gold standard treatment for ischemic stroke. However, when tPA is given beyond 4.5 hours of stroke onset, deleterious effects of the drug ensue, especially, hemorrhagic transformation (HT), which causes the most significant morbidity and mortality in stroke patients. An important clinical problem at hand is to develop strategies that will enhance the therapeutic time window for tPA therapy and reduce the adverse effects (especially HT) of delayed tPA treatment. We reviewed the pharmacological agents which reduced the risk of HT associated with delayed (beyond 4.5 hours post-stroke) tPA treatment in preclinical studies, which we classified into those that putatively preserve the blood-brain barrier (e.g., minocycline, cilostazol, fasudil, candesartan, and bryostatin) and/or enhance vascularization and protect the cerebrovasculature (e.g., coumarin derivate IMM-H004 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor). Recently, other new therapeutic modalities (e.g., oxygen transporters) have been reported which improved delayed tPA-associated outcomes by acting through other mechanisms. While the above-mentioned interventions unequivocally reduced delayed tPA-induced HT in stroke models, the long-term efficacy of these drugs are not yet established. Further optimization is required to expedite their future clinical application. The findings from this review indicate the need to explore the most ideal adjunctive interventions that will not only reduce delayed tPA–induced HT, but also preserve neurovascular functions. While waiting for the next breakthrough drug in acute stroke treatment, it is equally important to allocate considerable effort to find approaches to address the limitations of the only FDA-approved stroke therapy."

The structure and morphology of Ce-bpdc were measured by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The effects, such as saturated adsorption capacity, <SUP><SUB>HCO3</SUB>-</SUP>, and pH, were investigated. The optimal pH value for fluoride adsorption was the range from 5 to 6. The coexisting bicarbonate anions have a little influence on fluoride removal. The fluoride adsorption over the Ce-bpdc adsorbent could reach its equilibrium in about 20 min. The Ce-bpdc coordination complex exhibited high binding capacity for fluoride ions. The maximum adsorption capacity calculated from Langmuir model was high up to 45.5 mg/g at 298 K (pH = 7.0) and the removal efficiency was greater than 80%. In order to investigate the mechanism of fluoride removal, various adsorption isotherms such as Langmuir and Freundlich were fitted. The experimental data revealed that the Langmuir isotherm gave a more satisfactory fit for fluoride removal. Finally, the tested results of ground water samples from three places, Yuefang, Jiangji, and Sanyi which exhibited high removal efficiency, also demonstrate the potential utility of the Ce-bpdc as an effective adsorbent.</P>"

In the meantime, China`s economic growth depends heavily on excessive capital investment by the government sector. This growth model has made the Chinese economy vulnerable to global economic fluctuations, and the Chinese leadership has been working hard to raise the economic efficiency of the state-owned sector for strong endogenous growth, to create private sector investment, to create stable employment. The success and failure of the Chinese leadership`s economic development strategy is attracting the attention of the world.

The stabil-ities of convection in a growing mushy layer were analyzed here in the time-dependent solidification system of a near-eutectic melt cooled impulsively from below. The linear stability equations were transformed to self-similar forms by using the depth of the mushy layer as a length scale. In the liquid layer the stability equations are based on the propa-gation theory and the thermal buoyancy is neglected. The critical Rayleigh number for the mushy layer increases with decreasing the Stefan number and the Prandtl number. The critical conditions for solidification of aqueous ammonium chloride solution are discussed and compared with the results of the previous model for the liquid layer.
murine recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 attenuates kidney injury in experimental alport syndrome,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a monocarboxypeptidase in the renin-angiotensin system that catalyzes the breakdown of angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7. We have reported that ACE2 expression in the kidney is reduced in experimental Alport syndrome but the impact of this finding on disease progression has not been studied. Accordingly, we evaluated effects of murine recombinant ACE2 treatment in Col4a3 knockout mice, a model of Alport syndrome characterized by proteinuria and progressive renal injury. Murine recombinant ACE2 (0.5 mg/kg/day) was administered from four to seven weeks of age via osmotic mini-pump. Pathological changes were attenuated by murine recombinant ACE2 treatment which ameliorated kidney fibrosis as shown by decreased expression of COL1 alpha 1 mRNA, less accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins, and inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta signaling. Further, increases in proinflammatory cytokine expression, macrophage infiltration, inflammatory signaling pathway activation, and heme oxygenase-1 levels in Col4a3 knockout mice were also reduced by murine recombinant ACE2 treatment. Lastly, murine recombinant ACE2 influenced the turnover of renal ACE2, as it suppressed the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme, a negative regulator of ACE2. Thus, treatment with exogenous ACE2 alters angiotensin peptide metabolism in the kidneys of Co14a3 knockout mice and attenuates the progression of Alport syndrome nephropathy.</P>"

However, existing algorithms for processing XML streams do not fully take advantage of the facility since they have not been devised to run in parallel.

We transform a large collection of XPath expressions into multiple FSA-based query indexes and then process XML streams in parallel by virtue of the index-level parallelism. Each core works only with its own query index so that no synchronization issue occurs while filtering XML streams with multiple path patterns given by users. We also present an in-memory MapReduce model that enables to process a large collection of twig pattern joins over XML streams simultaneously. Twig pattern joins in our approach are performed by multiple H/W threads in a shared and balanced way.

angiogenesis in newly regenerated bone by secretomes of human mesenchymal stem cells,2017,"['Secretome', 'Conditioned medium', 'Cytokine', 'Mesenchymal stem cells', 'Angiogenesis', 'Bone']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Background: For an effective bone graft for reconstruction of the maxillofacial region, an adequate vascular network will be required to supply blood, osteoprogenitor cells, and growth factors. We previously reported that the secretomes of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-CM) contain numerous growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, transforming growth factor $(TGF)-{\beta}1$, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which can affect the cellular characteristics and behavior of regenerating bone cells. We hypothesized that angiogenesis is an important step for bone regeneration, and VEGF is one of the crucial factors in MSC-CM that would enhance its osteogenic potential. In the present study, we focused on VEGF in MSC-CM and evaluated the angiogenic and osteogenic potentials of MSC-CM for bone regeneration. Methods: Cytokines in MSC-CM were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured with MSC-CM or MSC-CM with anti-VEGF antibody (MSC-CM + anti-VEGF) for neutralization, and tube formation was evaluated. For the evaluation of bone and blood vessel formation with micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and for the histological and immunohistochemical analyses, a rat calvarial bone defect model was used. Results: The concentrations of IGF-1, VEGF, and $TGF-{\beta}1$ in MSC-CM were $1515.6{\pm}211.8pg/mL$, $465.8{\pm}108.8pg/mL$, and $339.8{\pm}14.4pg/mL$, respectively. Tube formation of HUVECs, bone formation, and blood vessel formation were increased in the MSC-CM group but decreased in the MSC-CM + anti-VEGF group. Histological findings suggested that new bone formation in the entire defect was observed in the MSC-CM group although it was decreased in the MSC-CM + anti-VEGF group. Immunohistochemistry indicated that angiogenesis and migration of endogenous stem cells were much more abundant in the MSC-CM group than in the MSC-CM + anti-VEGF group. Conclusions: VEGF is considered a crucial factor in MSC-CM, and MSC-CM is proposed to be an adequate therapeutic agent for bone regeneration with angiogenesis."

The removal of phenol using NPs in water was investigated to determine whether applying NPs for phenol removal from wastewater would be feasible. The recovered NPs were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In this research, phenol degradation was studied with hydrogen peroxide to assess the potential applicability of NPs for the treatment of wastewater. The results of the SEM and TEM analyses show that the separated NPs were <50nm in size. The FTIR spectra indicate the presence of C?O and O?H bonds in the NPs. The XRD results show the presence of metals oxides of Fe, Zn, and Cu, among others, on the surfaces of the NPs. The results of the XPS analyses show that various elements (e.g., C, O, Zn, and Fe) existed in the recovered NPs. The degree of phenol degradation by NPs in the presence of hydrogen peroxide was significant. Phenol degradation was found to be 100% for NPs synthesized at pH levels of 3 and 7 at a reaction time of 210min. A pseudo-first-order kinetic model showed a very good fit to the phenol degradation results. The probable mechanism for the removal of phenol by NPs was the degradation of phenol by hydroxyl radicals which were produced during the reaction between H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> and NPs in a liquid medium. The results of the present study indicate that NPs recovered from low-grade ASR can be applied for the removal of phenolic compounds from water."

transient heat transfer analysis of functionally graded cnt reinforced cylinders with various boundary conditions,2017,"['transient heat transfer analysis', 'carbon nanotubes', 'nanocomposite cylinders', 'mesh-free method', 'various boundary conditions']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In this work, transient heat transfer analysis of functionally graded (FG) carbon nanotube reinforced nanocomposite (CNTRC) cylinders with various essential and natural boundary conditions is investigated by a mesh-free method. The cylinders are subjected to thermal flux, convection environments and constant temperature faces. The material properties of the nanocomposite are estimated by an extended micro mechanical model in volume fraction form. The distribution of carbon nanotube (CNT) has a linear variation along the radial direction of axisymmetric cylinder. In the mesh-free analysis, moving least squares shape functions are used for approximation of temperature field in the weak form of heat transform equation and the transformation method is used for the imposition of essential boundary conditions. Newmark method is applied for solution time depended problem. The effects of CNT distribution pattern and volume fraction, cylinder thickness and boundary conditions are investigated on the transient temperature field of the nanocomposite cylinders."

Weerth did not overlook the confrontation between workers and machinesin the mid-19th century, and he portrays realistically the workers in the textile factory with new machinery in Fragment eines Romans. The machines, which are located in the centre of capitalist economic management, play a key role in determining the character of labor and the functional difference of workers. The literary elaboration of the new machine labor space, which was created by humans, but now turned into an object of fear and anxiety to them, is of significance in the sense that it is a literary confrontation with the reality of man-made space which is ultimately different from the natural one.

Conventional tubular structures often lack stability because non covalent molecular interactions are responsible for their conformational integrities. Herein we report the development of covalently linked chromogenic organic nanotubes which are prepared by using topochemical polymerization of self-assembled macrocyclic diacetylenes (MCDAs). Crystal structures of five MCDAs having different diameters were elucidated, and four of these substances were transformed to tubular polydiacetylenes (PDA) by UV-induced polymerization. Surprisingly, MCDA-1 was found to self-assemble in stacks with a tilt angle of 62.1 degrees which significantly deviates from the optimal value for polymerization of 45 degrees. This observation suggests that geometric parameters derived using linear diacetylene (DA) models might not be strictly applicable to polymerization of MCDA systems. Blue-phase PDAs obtained by polymerization of MCDA-1 and MCDA-3 have different thermochromic and solvatochromic properties, which enable them to be utilized for colorimetric differentiation of aromatic solvents including isomeric xylenes. The observations made and information obtained in this study should enhance the understanding and design of stimulus-responsive rigid organic nanotubes.</P>"

We use a film replenishment model to determine the recovery film thickness between rolling elements. We use a hydrodynamic model to describe film recovery, that results from the effects of surface tension. In this model, we consider the surface tension gradient in fluid depression as the driving force for fluid recovery. We use Fourier transform method to determine the time-dependent depth of depressed oil. We calculate the change in the central film thickness graphically by using the recovery equation in starved elastohydrodynamic lubrication(EHL) under operating conditions that include numbers of balls, sliding velocity, applied force, and ambient film thickness. We evaluate the degree of starvation by using the distance from the center of the contact area to the meniscus position. Parched lubrication, a phenomenon where the film thickness decreases consistently, occurs at the severe condition. We determine optimal values with respect to the numbers of balls, and sliding velocity. The investigation can contribute to the design operating conditions for proper lubrication."

In particular, attention on Taekwondo, which instructs mental education and physical technique systematically, continues to increase for this reason. Moreover, Taekwondo’s brand asset and value has augmented since the transformation of awareness that this sport can be performed by all ages. The Taekwondo industry also faces fierce competition at an alarming rate due to market saturation. Thus, Taekwondo uniform companies jump into promotions by developing new products and active marketing in order to create new income structures and increase sales. This study analyzes the relation between Taekwondo uniform selective attributes, brand images, brand reliability, and behavioral intention of Taekwondo trainees and presents implications of marketing strategies for sustainable growth in this industry.Methods: This study selected Taekwondo athletes who participated in a 2017 Taekwondo national competition as samples. In addition, researchers visited them, explained the study’s purpose, distributed 300 questionnaires through convenience sampling, and received 298 back. Some (n = 11) questionnaires were excluded, because they were incomplete. Thus, 287 questionnaires were used in this study. SPSS 22.0 and AMOS 22.0 were employed for data process and analysis and frequency, confirmative factors, reliability, correlation, and structural equation model (SEM) analyses were conducted.Results: First, it was demonstrated that self-display and brand conformity were significant in influencing experiential images of Taekwondo brands, brand conformity influenced functional images and functionality, and trademark dependency affected considerably symbolic images. Second, experiential images and functional images affected brand reliability significantly among sub-factors of Taekwondo uniform brand images. Third, brand reliability had significant influence in constant purchase intention and word-of-mouth intention.Conclusions: Therefore, Taekwondo brands should provide a variety of distinct selective attributes reflecting trainees’ needs in order to build familiar and sentimental images between brands and trainees. In addition, identifying images for representing their brands by studying brand image and the identity formation and by making trainees familiar with their brands should be priorities. It is important to let customers promote voluntarily purchased brands as well as recommend and spread them to others. In this way, it is necessary to actively use bilateral communication that could induce constantly reliable relationships with customers."
product strategy and export performance: the roles of exploitative and exploratory innovation capability,2017,"['product strategy', 'export performance', 'innovation', 'cost leadership and differentiation strategy']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This study employs the resource-based view to understand how product strategy influence export performance. According to the organizational learning perspective, moreover, the ability to manage existing assets and capabilities and the development of new capabilities are arguably among the most relevant innovation success factors. Based on these theoretical backgrounds, a model is proposed to analyze the effects of cost leadership and differentiation strategy on export performance, as well as the moderating effects of exploitative and exploratory innovation capability. Using survey data from Korean exporters, the findings indicate that the cost leadership and differentiation strategy enhance export performance. While exploitative innovation capability strengthens the relationship between cost leadership strategy and export performance, exploratory innovation capability enhances the link between differentiation strategy and export performance.IntroductionThe trade-off between cost leadership strategy and differentiation strategy is of importance and presents a key challenge to exporters because it is intrinsically related to innovation (Gebauer, 2008; O’Cass et al., 2014). Nevertheless, resources are limited, and firms must make choices in their allocation and determine the extent to which they will emphasize one strategy over another (Danneels, 2007; Lant, Milliken, & Batra, 1992). Although the individual roles of product strategies or innovation capabilities on export performance have attracted considerable attention (e.g., Hortinha, Lages, & Lages, 2011; Lages, Silva, & Styles, 2009; Molina-Castillo, Jimenez-Jimenez, & Munuera-Aleman, 2011), few studies have assessed their integrating impact - that is, the difference in the strengths of the relationships between cost leadership or differentiation strategy and innovation. Drawing on resource based view, we examine how innovation capabilities related with the relationship between cost leadership and differentiation strategies and exporters’ performance. Thus, we consider the moderating role of two distinct capabilities - exploratory innovation and exploitative innovation - on the relationships between product strategies and export performance. Exploratory innovation includes activities aimed to enter new product-market domains, while exploitative innovation activities improve existing product-market domains (He &Wong, 2004).The objectives of this study are to explore (1) impacts of cost leadership strategy and differentiation strategy on export performance, (2) moderating effects of exploitative and exploratory innovation capability on the relationship between product strategy and export performance, and (3) these relationships in the context of Korean exporters. The Korean exporting firms are more concentrated on international markets because of limited size of domestic market (Nugent & Yhee, 2002). These characteristics of Korean exporters are more useful to examine the effect of product strategy and product innovation capability of firms on export performance in international markets.Conceptual BackgroundProduct Strategy and Competitive AdvantagePorter (1980) argues that a firm can achieve a higher level of performance over a rival in one of two ways: either it can supply an identical product or service at a lower cost, or it can supply a product or service that is differentiated in such a way that the customer is willing to pay a price premium that exceeds the additional cost of the differentiation. A cost leadership strategy is designed to produce goods or services more cheaply than competitors by stressing efficient scale of operation. When a firm designs, produces, and sells a comparable product more efficiently than its competitors as well as its market scope is industry-wide, it means that the firm is carrying out the cost leadership strategy successfully (Campbell-Hunt, 2000). Thus, the primary thing for a firm seeking competitively valuable way by reducing cost is to concentrate on maintaining efficiency through all activities in order to effectively control every expense and find new sources of potential cost reduction (Dess & Davis, 1984). The differentiation strategy provides value to customers with the unique attributes or perceptions of uniqueness, and characteristics of a firm’s product other than cost. The firm pursuing differentiation seeks to be unique in its industry along some dimension that is valued by customers, which means investing in product R&D and marketing (Porter, 1980). Rather than cost reduction, a firm using the differentiation needs to concentrate on investing in and developing such things that are distinguishable and customers will perceive (Gebauer, 2008). Overall, the essential success factor of differentiation in terms of strategy implementation is to develop and maintain innovativeness, creativeness, and organizational learning within a firm (Dess & Davis, 1984; O’Cass et al., 2014; Porter, 1985).Innovation Capability in International MarketsA firm’s ability to compete in the long term may lie in its ability to integrate product strategy and its existing capabilities, while at the same time developing fundamentally new ones (Lavie & Rosenkopf, 2006). Simultaneous investments in the exploitation of existing product innovation capabilities and the exploration of new ones may help create a competitive advantage (Soosay & Hyland, 2008). Organizational learning represents the development of knowledge that influences behavioral changes and leads to enhanced performance (Crossan, Lane, & White, 1999; Fiol & Lyles, 1985). Product innovation is a tool for organizational learning and, thus, a primary means of achieving its strategic renewal (Danneels, 2002; Dougherty, 1992; O’Cass et al., 2014). Exploration pertains more to new knowledge - such as the search for new products, ideas, markets, or relationships; experimentation; risk taking; and discovery - while exploitation pertains more to using the existing knowledge and refining what already exists; it includes adaptation, efficiency, and execution (March, 1991). Exploration and exploitation compete for the same resources and efforts in the firm. With a focus on exploring potentially valuable future opportunities, the firm decreases activities linked to improving existing competences (Levinthal & March, 1993; March, 1991). In contrast, with a focus on exploiting existing products and processes, the firm reduces development of new opportunities. However, firms must develop both exploratory and exploitative capabilities because returns from exploration are uncertain, often negative, and attained over the long run, while exploitation generates more positive, proximate, and predictable returns (Levinthal & March, 1993; March, 1991; ?zsomer & Gen?t?rk, 2003). Researchers have shown that both types of learning are essential to enhancing firm performance (Leonard-Barton, 1992; March, 1991). In this study, we use exploration and exploitation to describe two innovation-related capabilities that are critical elements on the relationship between product strategies and export performance.International markets are turbulent and diverse with respect to customer needs, cultures, and competitiveness; therefore, innovation assumes a primary role (Kleinschmidt, De Brentani, & Salomo, 2007). Firms can leverage their innovations by securing business opportunities in those markets and thus increase their innovative capabilities (Knight & Cavusgil, 2004). Through exploratory innovation, firms develop new competences and thus enhance superior export performance by product strategies (Teece, Pisano, & Shuen, 1997). Exploitation activities are also important to exporters because they facilitate the lower-risk extension of export operations. By searching for solutions in the existent competence base, exploitative innovation increases efficiency and productivity. Accordingly, this study based on organizational learning perspective to support the idea that innovation capabilities are a vehicle for a product strategy, and achieving superior export performance. We advance the literature by allowing for a role of product strategies while also considering moderating effects of innovation capabilities. Moreover, we provide insights into how choices about emphasizing one product strategy over another relates the balance between exploration and exploitation.HypothesesProduct Strategy and Export PerformancePorter’s cost leadership and differentiation strategies have been linked to the achievement of superior performance by many studies (Campbell-Hunt, 2000; Dess & Davis, 1984). A firm that successfully pursues a cost leadership strategy emphasizes “aggressive construction of efficient-scale facilities, vigorous pursuit of cost reductions from experience, tight cost and overhead control, avoidance of marginal customer accounts, and cost minimization in areas like R&D, service, sales force, advertising, and so on” (Porter, 1980: 35). A firm can, therefore, gain a competitive advantage over its rivals by having significantly lower cost structures in an industry without ignoring other areas such as product and service quality (Amoako-Gyampah & Acquaah, 2008). Thus, the maintenance of a strong competitive position for an organization pursuing a cost leadership strategy places a premium on efficiency of operations and scale economies that enable them to achieve and sustain their performance for a considerable period of time. In addition, with a cost leadership strategy, firms focus on reducing costs through operational efficiency. For example, they might exploit existing facilities and learn how to reduce costs through automation, modernization, capacity utilization, or economies of scale. Efficiency, control, planning, and variance reduction represent the key elements of a cost leadership strategy, and a typical example of a cost leadership strategy involves the implementation of an experience curve, on which cumulative production determines reductions in unit production costs. Firms engage in economies of scale and/or scope when they apply their knowledge and facilities from existing product lines to product line extensions. The associated positional advantage is a cost advantage pertaining to the firms’ value offering and is based on the product’s price–perceived value proposition in the export market.Hypothesis 1: Cost leadership strategy is positively associated with export performance.A firm that pursues a differentiation strategy may attempt to create a unique image in the minds of customers that its products are superior to those of its competitors (Miller, 1988). A firm creates these perceptions through advertising programs, marketing techniques and methods, and charging premium prices. Moreover, a firm may pursue a differentiation strategy by creating a perception in the minds of customers that its products possess characteristics that are unique from those of its competitors in terms of differences in design, physical attributes/features, and durability (Gebauer, 2008). Differentiation strategy aims to generate more outwardly focused product innovations that offer customers product differences that shape a distinctive value offering that is more responsive to their needs (Hughes, Martin, Morgan, & Robson, 2010; O’Cass et al., 2014). The associated positional advantage is a product or market differentiation advantage pertaining to the superior brand, quality, design, and product features that differentiate the firms’ value proposition from its competitors in the export market.Hypothesis 2: Differentiation strategy is positively associated with export performance.Moderating Effects of Innovation CapabilityFrom the generation of new ideas through to the launch of a new product, exploration and exploitation play a vital role in product innovation (Rothaermel & Deeds, 2004). Organizations can decide to use existing organizational competences to realize short-term results, or create new competences that may foster the development of innovations in the longer term (Atuahene-Gima, 2005). Both types of capabilities are considered to be dynamic in nature (Winter, 2003), given that their purpose is to transform existing resources into new functional competences that provide a better match for the firm's environment (Voss, Sirdeshmukh, & Voss, 2008). Although both exploitative and exploratory capabilities related to cost leadership and differentiation strategies, because of those different roles of capabilities in innovation process, the effects of those innovation capabilities on the relationship between product strategy and export performance might be different. In case of cost leadership strategy, firms focus on using and developing existing capabilities, promoting improvements in existing components and building on existing technological elements (Benner & Tushman, 2003; Rust et al., 2002). Similarly, exploitative innovation is aimed at improving existing product-market domains. The cost leadership strategy creates value through existing competences or competences that have been slightly modified (Voss et al., 2008). It promotes a routine-based and repetitive approach to organizational changes (Rust et al., 2002). Because exploitative innovation builds on existing knowledge and extends existing products and services for existing customers (Soosay & Hyland, 2008), exploitative capabilities helps firms pursuing cost leadership strategy to reap the benefits of improvement they make to their products and to continue making incremental improvements (Brucks, Zeithaml, & Naylor, 2000), which are designed to allow the firm to continue its superior performance (Griffin, 1997).Hypothesis 3: Exploitative innovation capability moderates the relationship between cost leadership strategy and export performance positively.Compared to cost leadership strategy, differentiation strategy is characterized by radical change, risk and experimentation and that allows for the creation of new methods, relationships, and products. Because exploration focuses mainly on trying to create variety, to adapt and hence exploit ever-decreasing windows of opportunity (Soosay & Hyland, 2008), this capability is more beneficial to the kind of product innovativeness to the firm (Augusto & Coelho, 2009). When exporters pursue differentiation strategy for acquiring new knowledge and developing new products and services, exploratory capability helps to engage new insight into the design of new features and benefits of a given product, that product is guaranteed to contain new ideas (Cho & Pucik, 2005; Yalcinkaya et al., 2007). In contrast with exploitation aimed at improving existing product-market domains, explorative innovation requires fundamental changes in the way an organization operates and represents a clear departure from existing practices (Menguc &Auh, 2006).Hypothesis 4: Exploratory innovation capability moderates the relationship between differentiation strategy and export performance positively.DiscussionFocusing on product strategy through the application of the RBV has provided theoretical insights as well as empirical evidence as to which capabilities are required to achieve these critical product strategy outcomes. The support from this study provides further evidence of the usefulness of applying the RBV to the export setting and should encourage researchers to examine the other aspects of export strategy. Based on organizational learning perspective, in addition, this study found that exploratory and exploitative innovation capability are essential to the firm because they act as vehicles for renewing product strategy to achieve superior export performance. By considering product strategy with exploration and exploitation simultaneously, we present a new perspective of the roles of these product strategies in the development of firms’ innovation capabilities. Our results indicate that cost leadership and differentiation strategy are pivotal in ensuring a proper balance between exploratory and exploitative innovations.One of the main implications for managers is that both exploratory and exploitative product competences should consider in parallel when developing product strategy. The findings underscore the need for managers to invest in cost leadership and differentiation strategy to ensure the development of exploration and exploitation. Therefore, resource allocation decisions should, consider the firm's needs for innovation capabilities and, on the other hand, be guided by the firm’s product strategy. Exporters operate in highly complex environments, characterized by high levels of technological and market uncertainties and highly diverse and dispersed customers (Kleinschmidt et al., 2007; Mohr & Sarin, 2009). Therefore, in addition to the product strategy toward the development of innovations using state-of-the-art technologies, managers of these firms need a similarly strong focus on understanding both current and potential exporting markets. By acknowledging the need for product strategy, managers can ensure the balanced innovation capabilities."
principles for personalized instruction,2017,"['instructional design theory', 'personalized instruction', 'learner-centered instruction', 'instructional design']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Personalized instruction has taken on an increased importance in modern society that has not yet been reflected in actual substantive changes to our educational systems. Current information-age societies require critical thinkers and life-long learners, educational outcomes less likely to be developed in a time-based system and therefore requiring a system of education focused on student learning and mastery of skills and knowledge (McCombs & Whisler, 1997; Reigeluth & Watson, 2008). Such transformation of education requires personalization of instruction. This paper draws from the literature to define personalization and formulate an instructional theory and principles for the instructional design of personalized learning. The paper covers learning theory that forms the basis for personalized instruction as well as existing models in the literature. It then describes the values behind personalized instruction before identifying universal principles. These principles include personalized instructional goals, personalized task environment, personalized scaffolding of instruction, personalized assessment of performance and learning, and personalized reflection."

The physico-chemical properties of the original and modified ACF samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Zeta potential, Boehm titration, BET, Raman spectrum and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was found that modification treatments damage the pore and graphite crystalline structure of ACF, while the micropore structure is protected and extra oxygen-containing surface functional groups are grafted on its surface. The adsorption performance of the original and the modified ACF samples affected by adsorption conditions regarding to Pb(II) ion strength (10mg/L- 105mg/L), contact time (10min-120 min), pH value (2.5-6.5), and solvent temperature (15 oC-45 oC) was investigated through batch experiments. Compared to the maximum Pb(II) ion adsorption capacity of 75.24mg/g by ACF sample, the value was substantially improved by the integrated modification method (193.42mg/g for ACF-O and 209.21mg/g for ACF-S sample). The Biot number determined from the homogeneous surface diffusion model (HSDM) was between 1 and 100 for the original and modified ACF samples, suggesting that the adsorption process of Pb(II) ions is limited by both the surface diffusion and film mass transfer."

There are several concerns, however, in regards to the access and use of articles by researchers together with the continued increase of libraries’ expenditure for journals. In the present article we introduce five solutions in the global and local perspectives. OA2020 initiative is a global initiative to transform existing journals to OA. Although the practical process of OA2020 remains a challenge, the transformation will increase OA without significant increase of journals and budgets for publishing. The promotion of the local and Asian journals is the second big challenge. Because these local or Asian journals still have important roles in the local research community, they should keep current publishing model of OA at the low cost but with high quality and the better access. The restructuring of the current library budget is the third challenge. The budget for periodicals should be reduced and the saved budget can be used to pay articles processing charge for OA and for purchasing monographs. The fourth important issue is ‘the digital blind spot at the young unemployed and retired elderly’. These groups of poorly supported and potentially important researchers have to be considered as a priority issue to the policies on OA and scholarly knowledge. Lastly, we believe there should be different needs for other activities: optimization of the searchable database, governmental policy on open science and international cooperation on OA"

The results were compared with experiments from a steady test facility at similar test conditions. Further, the primary characteristics of noise events in jet far-field were compared with analytical models considering wavepacket as the main source of jet noise. The results indicate that higher frequency events at θ = 90˚ occur with a small time shift relative to the low azimuthal mode base event. This phenomenon might be the main reason why the acoustic signal at the side angles behaves more noisily than at low polar angles."

Within Greco-Roman philosophy, these practices fell under the general rubric of knowing and taking care of oneself. They were among the main rules for social and personal conduct. If western philosophy wishes to be of practical value once again, it must restore its original technologies and adapt them to 21st century man.

Based on recent trends in second/foreign language teacher education, suggestions are made for developing English teachers in Korea. First, given that learning occurs through interaction and social participation in specific contexts, student teachers need to have more opportunities to participate in the educational field and to increase their understanding of it. Next, as reflection on practice serves to transform theoretical knowledge into practice and to generate the type of knowledge required of expert teachers, it is necessary to develop student teachers’ reflective skills. Finally, there is a need to help English language teachers establish their identity as teachers who teach English as an international language rather than as the first language of its native speakers."
an accurate and cost-effective stereo matching algorithm and processor for real-time embedded multimedia systems,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Stereo matching is a vision technique for finding three-dimensional (3D) distance information in various multimedia applications by calculating pixel disparities between the matching points of a stereo image pair captured from a stereo camera. The most important considerations in stereo matching are highly accurate results and real-time performance. Thus, this paper proposes an accurate stereo matching algorithm that uses both a census transform algorithm and the sum of absolute differences algorithm in a complementary manner and its real-time hardware architecture. In addition, the proposed algorithm uses a vertical census transform with cost aggregation (VCTCA) to reduce hardware costs while maintaining high matching accuracy. We model the proposed algorithm using C language and verify it in several environments. Using a hardware description language, we implement the proposed hardware architecture and verify it on a field-programmable gate array-based platform to confirm the cost and performance of the hardware. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm using the VCTCA produces accurate 3D distance information in real environments and reduces the hardware complexity. Thus, the algorithm and its hardware architecture are suitable for real-time embedded multimedia systems.</P>"

The time histories of the water waves on both surface boundaries are simulated using the numerical wave tank (NWT) technique by an oscillating circular body located on the free surface or underwater in the lower fluid domain.

The FGM consists of a ceramic part (on the top), which is the hot side of the beam as the heat source motion takes place along this side, and a metal part (in the bottom), which is considered the cold side. Grading is in the transverse direction, with the properties being temperature-dependent. The main steps of the thermo-elastic modeling included deriving the partial differential equations for the temperatures and deflections in time and space, transforming them into ordinary differential equations using Laplace transformation, and finally using the inverse Laplace transformation to find the solutions. The effects of different parameters on the thermo-mechanical behavior of the beam are investigated, such as the convection coefficient and the heat source intensity and speed. The results show that temperatures, and hence the deflections and stresses increase with less heat convection from the beam surface, higher heat source intensity and low speeds."

In DEINs, the base station (BS) adopts the power splitting (PS) aided simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) technique in the downlink (DL) transmissions, while the user equipments (UEs) carry out their own uplink (UL) transmissions by exploiting the energy harvested during the BS`s DL transmissions. In our DEIN model, there are UEs served by the BS in order to fulfil both of their DL and UL transmissions. The orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) technique is adopted for supporting the simultaneous transmissions of multiple UEs. Furthermore, a transmission frame is divided into time slots in the medium access control (MAC) layer. The mathematical model is established for maximizing the sum-throughput of the UEs` DL transmissions and for ensuring their fairness during a single transmission frame , respectively. In order to achieve these goals, in each transmission frame T, we optimally allocate the BS`s power for each subcarrier and the PS factor for each UE during a specific time slot. The original optimisation problems are transformed into convex forms, which can be perfectly solved by convex optimisation theories. Our numerical results compare the optimal results by conceiving the objective of maximising the sum-throughput and those by conceiving the objective of maximising the fair-throughput. Furthermore, our numerical results also reveal the inherent tradeoff between the DL and the UL transmissions."

Until recently, the Draize test was considered the standard method for skin irritation; however, this technique has disadvantages such as the need to sacrifice many rabbits and subjective scoring. Thus, to contribute to the development of an animal-free alternative skin irritation test, we investigated the cytotoxicity and inflammatory response to standard skin irritants in SV40 large T antigen-transformed human epidermal keratinocyte 2 cells (SV-HEK2 cells). In this study, we established an SV-HEK2 cell line immortalized by SV40 large T antigen (SV40 T) and characterized the inherent morphological and cytological properties. We next used 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) or neutral red uptake (NRU) assays of cell viability to investigate the optimal experimental conditions for determining SV-HEK2 cell viability after exposure to sodium dodecyl sulfate at 6.25×10<SUP>−3</SUP>% to 1×10<SUP>−1</SUP>% as a standard skin irritant. We then examined the viability of SV-HEK2 cells in response to five skin irritants (benzalkonium chloride, isopropanol, sodium dodecyl sulfate, Triton X-100 and Tween20) at 5×10<SUP>−3</SUP>% to 1×10<SUP>−1</SUP>% by MTT or NRU assay. Finally, we estimated the level of cytokines secretion in response to stimulation by skin irritants in SV-HEK2 cells. The results revealed that SV-HEK2 cells responded well to skin irritants in a concentration-dependent manner and that there was good correlation between irritant concentration and cytotoxicity (or cytokine secretion) when cells were exposed to skin irritants for 10min at room temperature (RT) using an MTT assay.

We report first principles modelling of this scenario using a particle-in-cell code, which evolves the full orbit dynamics of large numbers of energetic protons, thermal deuterons, and electrons self-consistently with the electric and magnetic fields. The Fourier transform of the excited fields in the nonlinear saturated regime of the simulations is the theoretical counterpart to the measured ICE spectra. Multiple simulation runs for different, adjacent, values of the plasma density under KSTAR edge conditions enable us to infer the theoretical dependence of ICE spectral structure on the local electron number density. By matching this density dependence to the observed time-dependence of chirping ICE spectra in KSTAR, we obtain sub-microsecond time resolution of the evolving local electron number density during the ELM crash.</P>"

The coupling reaction of these carboxylic acids with primary alkylamine-loaded acid-sensitive methoxybenzaldehyde (AMEBA) resins was followed by amination reactions mediated by benzotriazol-1-yloxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP). Subsequent cleavage from the solid support resulted in the formation of the target <I>N</I>-alkyl-4-alkylamino-1-aryl-1<I>H</I>-pyrazolo[3,4-<I>d</I>]pyrimidine-6-carboxamide derivatives. The reaction conditions for solid-phase transformations were optimized using a solution-phase model study with 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl-protected isobutylamine as a reactant in place of the AMEBA resin-loaded isobutylamine. The progress of the solid-phase reactions was monitored by on-bead ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Diversification experiments were performed by using 1-aryl-4,5-dihydro-1<I>H</I>-pyrazolo[3,4-<I>d</I>]pyrimidin-4-one-6-carboxylic acids and a variety of primary and secondary amine building blocks to build the target compound library.</P>   <P><B>Graphical abstract</B></P>   <P>[DISPLAY OMISSION]</P>"

image steganography for authenticity of visual contents in social networks,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Social networks are major sources of image sharing and secret messaging among the people. To date, such networks are not strictly bounded by copyright laws due to which image sharing, secret messaging, and its authentication is vulnerable to many risks. In addition to this, maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of secret messages is an open challenge of today's communication systems. Steganography is one of the solutions to tackle these problems. This paper proposes a secure crystographic framework for authenticity of visual contents using image steganography, utilizing color model transformation, three-level encryption algorithm (TLEA), and Morton scanning (MS)-directed least significant bit (LSB) substitution. The method uses I-plane of the input image in HSI for secret data embedding using MS-directed LSB substitution method. Furthermore, the secret data is encrypted using TLEA prior to embedding, adding an additional level of security for secure authentication. The qualitative and quantitative results verify the better performance of the proposed scheme and provide one of the best mechanisms for authenticity of visual contents in social networks.</P>"
qoe-aware energy efficiency maximization based joint user access selection and power allocation for heterogeneous network,2017,"['QoE-aware energy efficiency', 'joint allocation', 'heterogeneous networks', 'chaotic clone immune algorithm']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In future, since the user experience plays a more and more important role in the development of today’s communication systems, quality of experience (QoE) becomes a widely used metric, which reflects the subjective experience of end users for wireless service. In addition, the energy efficiency is an increasingly important problem with the explosive growth in the amount of wireless terminals and nodes. Hence, a QoE-aware energy efficiency maximization based joint user access selection and power allocation approach is proposed to solve the problem. We transform the joint allocation process to an optimization of energy efficiency by establishing an energy efficiency model, and then the optimization problem is solved by chaotic clone immune algorithm (CCIA). Numerical simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm can efficiently and reliably improve the QoE and ensure high energy efficiency of networks."

In this paper, a hybrid control and protection scheme is proposed, which combines the traditional inverse-time overcurrent protection with the biased differential protection for different feeders with different kinds of loads. It naturally accommodates various control strategies such as P-Q control and V-f control. The parameter settings of the protection scheme are analyzed and calculated through a fast Fourier transform algorithm, and the stability of the control strategy is discussed by building a small signal model in MATLAB. Different operation modes such as the grid-connected mode, the islanding mode, and the transitions between these two modes are ensured. A Microgrid model is established in PSCAD and the analysis results show that a Microgrid system can be effectively protected against different faults such as the single phase to ground and the three phase faults in both the grid-connected and islanded operation modes."

predicting the morphology of perovskite thin films produced by sequential deposition method: a crystal growth dynamics study,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>We performed a kinetic analysis of the sequential deposition method (SDM) to investigate how to form perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) phases, and the effects of processing conditions on the final perovskite morphology. The reaction was found to consist of two periods with distinct kinetics. During the first period, perovskite crystals nucleated on the lead iodide (PbI2) surface, and the reaction proceeded until the surface was completely converted to perovskites. The reaction during this period determined the surface morphology of the perovskites. We were able to extract the value of the rate of the phase transformation during the first period by applying the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov model, in which the rate r is related to the average grain size R by R proportional to r(-1/3). In this way, r was used to predict the surface morphology of the perovskite under certain processing conditions. During the second period, the remaining lead iodide under the top perovskite layer was converted. Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I, MAI) molecules apparently diffused into the buried PbI2 through intergrain gaps of the top perovskite layers. Added MAI molecules reacted with PbI2 but also generated single-crystal perovskite nanorods, nanoplates, and nanocubes. The current study has furthered the understanding of detailed features of the SDM, enabled a reliable prediction of the final perovskite morphology resulting from specified processing conditions, and contributed to a reproducible fabrication of high-quality perovskite films.</P>"
hearing loss screening tool (cobra score) for newborns in primary care setting,2017,"['Hearing loss', 'Screening tool', 'Newborns', 'Primary care']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Purpose: To develop and evaluate a simple screening tool to assess hearing loss in newborns. A derived score was compared with the standard clinical practice tool. Methods: This cohort study was designed to screen the hearing of newborns using transiently evoked otoacoustic emission and auditory brain stem response, and to determine the risk factors associated with hearing loss of newborns in 3 tertiary hospitals in Northern Thailand. Data were prospectively collected from November 1, 2010 to May 31, 2012. To develop the risk score, clinical-risk indicators were measured by Poisson risk regression. The regression coefficients were transformed into item scores dividing each regression-coefficient with the smallest coefficient in the model, rounding the number to its nearest integer, and adding up to a total score. Results: Five clinical risk factors (Craniofacial anomaly, Ototoxicity, Birth weight, family history [Relative] of congenital sensorineural hearing loss, and Apgar score) were included in our COBRA score. The screening tool detected, by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, more than 80% of existing hearing loss. The positive-likelihood ratio of hearing loss in patients with scores of 4, 6, and 8 were 25.21 (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.69-43.26), 58.52 (95% CI, 36.26-94.44), and 51.56 (95% CI, 33.74-78.82), respectively. This result was similar to the standard tool (The Joint Committee on Infant Hearing) of 26.72 (95% CI, 20.59-34.66). Conclusion: A simple screening tool of five predictors provides good prediction indices for newborn hearing loss, which may motivate parents to bring children for further appropriate testing and investigations."

Second, the course needs to reflect the individuality and plurality of the post-modern era than the rationality and universality of the modern. Along with the requirements, the Myongji chapel has been transformed for 20 years. To be more specific, undergoing the three phases of changes, the chapel has acquired positive feedbacks from its students. The Myongji chapel has changed from a worship service to a lecture that teaches Christian values and world-view; it changed to a music-talk chapel reflecting the diversity and sensibility of the post-modern; in so doing, the chapel has been developed to a whole-person educational subject. Therefore, this article proposes that the chapel as a whole-person education can be a relevant model in the era of the crisis."

It is required to review the ARF estimations in Malaysia as some shortcomings have been noticed in the existing technical manual. This study attempted to merge observed rainfall data from rainfall stations with satellite rainfall products for derivation of ARF as conventional ground based rainfall monitoring networks have the major drawback of limited rainfall measuring coverage over large spatial extent especially for sparse monitoring networks. To this end, annual maximum areal rainfall for interval of 1-hour, 3-hour, 6-hour, 12-hour, and 24-hour have been computed from nine rainfall stations located within the study area and the corresponding satellite rainfall products were also extracted for rainfall clustering analysis. The observed rainfall data were merged with satellite rainfall products of Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks - Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) using several merging techniques which are Geographical Differential Analysis (GDA), distribution transformations, and regression analysis. GDA approach was identified as the best merging technique over the others as it yielded most promising results when correlating with observed rainfall data with average R² of 0.603 and RMSE of 8.150. It is found out that GDA was able to model maximum rainfall amount as observed in the rainfall stations while the other merging techniques were failed to do so. It is noticed from the rainfall clustering analysis that the average threshold radius obtained for observed rainfall data of fixed boundary area of 1,024 ㎢ was smaller than the one obtained for satellite rainfall products. This implies that spatial distribution of satellite rainfall products was more homogenous than observed rainfall data. Thus higher values may be obtained from ARF derivation using satellite rainfall products."

Next, this paper suggests the basic policies of the democratic republic based upon the liberal socialist visions of the Roberto Unger, Chantal Mouffe and Zhiyuan Cui. In the area of politics, it is absolutely necessary to strengthen direct democracy for supplementing the representative system. Considering constitutional court and legislative process, Citizen`s Constitutional Jury or Citizen`s Model Assembly will efficiently check the juristocracy or the political class and speed up politics. In the economy, state interventions and adjustments are permanently necessary for enhancing capability of ordinary people. The liberal socialist policies help ordinary people to act individually or collectively as the subjects of the production economy by providing education, skills, and capital to them. A variety of policies should be able to be experimented from the republican to the petty-bourgeois socialistic property regime in order to transform the fixed neoliberal economic order Furthermore, democratic principles for organization and decision-making should break the prevalence of patriarchy and oligarchy in the social-cultural sphere. At the same time, on issues of minorities and identity groups, it is important to look for alternatives from the standpoint of freedom as non-domination. Human beings are social actors that eventually do their best to secure their own positions, no matter where they might be. The politics of empowerment that awakens the potential of ordinary people will certainly contribute to the common prosperity and social progress of mankind better than stringent regulatory politics or laisser-faire politics."
instrumental and sensory assessment for the classification of solid food texture for the elderly diets,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Chewing and swallowing disorders such as dysphagia are common in the elderly people whose number is reported to continuously increase throughout the world. With this trend, the aging populations have recently become the global focus of substantial research interest in a variety of industrial fields and the food industry is also no exception. Further studies are also necessary to establish the guidelines or criteria for controlling the food texture for the elderly with different living and cultural backgrounds. An experimental attempt was made to bridge the gap between instrumental and sensory texture in a model solid food system, providing a reference texture range for the elderly diets. For doing so, uniaxial compression was applied to measure the instrumental hardness of corn starch gels that was correlated with their sensory properties perceived by the elderly aged 60 and older. A polynomial trend line was satisfactorily obtained with the formula (y=0.2188x2-5.7917x+38.14) describing the relationship between instrumental hardness and starch concentration. When the instrumental hardness (stress) was correlated with the sensory hardness, a linear correlation was observed with a coefficient of determination (R2=0.879). However, the use of logarithmic transformation exhibited the improved correlation of coefficients. A fairly linear correlation (R2>0.96) was thus observed between the instrumental and sensory hardness by a semi-logarithmic relationship known as Weber-Fechner’s law scale. In principal component analysis, two principal components that accounted for 86.71% of the total variance, separated the gel samples in terms of hardness/springiness and moistness, respectively. The categories of the starch gel samples were subdivided into five groups with different stress ranges. As a result, five categories of food texture could be successfully provided with corresponding stress range and consumer languages that can be used as a reference tool to establish the guideline or criteria for developing the elderly foods."

Trees, composed of multi-scale fractal structures, modify the airflow through and around them in a complicated manner. This research investigates how engineered porous fences, designed using a typical multi-scale fractal structure, would change the wake characteristics and subsequently reshape the wind shelter effects. A two-dimensional (2D) fractal fence composed of cross-grid type fractal struts, along with an one-dimensional (1D) fractal fence, were tested using a planar particle image velocimetry (Ply) method in a boundary-layer wind tunnel. Wakes and shelter effects of two fractal fences are compared to those of the nonfractal fence model of the same height, length, bottom gap and porosity of 50%. Results of the 2D fractal fence show a clear favorable shelter effect - the extended sheltered area of 1.5-4 times the fence height with the shelter parameter of 0.4, about 70% longer than that of the non-fractal fence provides. Multi-scale fractal fences may potentially be adopted to transform the porous fence design by allowing tuning of the arrangement of struts, an additional set of parameters besides fence height, length and porosity.</P>"

Further characterizations of both the susceptibility of flow behavior to the electric fields and the electrical polarization property of the PS/PDPA-based ER fluid were performed by using an LCR meter to provide additional information supporting its ER performance, which was determined to follow a conduction model with a slope of 1.5.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  Poly(diphenylamine) coated core-shell composite was fabricated as ER material. </LI> <LI>  Synthesis process includes both controlled-releasing process and chemical oxidation. </LI> <LI>  Poly(diphenylamine) system does not require de-doping process for ER materials. </LI> <LI>  ER property was well correlated with its dielectric characteristics. </LI> </UL> </P>   <P><B>Graphical abstract</B></P>   <P>[DISPLAY OMISSION]</P>"
2010년 프랑스 문화원 설립을 통해서 본 프랑스 대외문화활동의 개혁,2017,"['프랑스문화원(Institut francais)', '대외문화활동(action culturelle exterieure)', '개혁(reforme)', '세계화(mondialisation)', '영향외교(diplomatie d`influence)']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"En 2007, le “Time” europeen a annonce ≪la mort de la culture francaise≫ soulignant que le rayonnement culturel, passe, de la France n`est plus present aujourd`hui. La mondialisation progresse, et le pouvoir de l`influence est devenu l`element le plus important pour la diplomatie a l`ere de la mondialisation. Il fallait changer la strategie de la diplomatie culturelle sans etre attache a la gloire passee.Ainsi, M. Bernard Kouchner, ministre des Affaires etrangeres et europeennes, conscient du changement de la diplomatie, a annonce, a travers la loi de projet en 2009, une reforme de l`action culturelle exterieure de l`Etat. Le projet prioritaire de cette reforme a ete de creer une ""grande agence"" qui rassemble des diverses forces dispersees: Institut francais, transformation de CulturesFrance en etablissement public a caractere industriel et commercial. Son but est d`exercer un pilotage strategique avec plus d`efficacite, plus de coherence et de visibilite.L`Institut francais a repris les missions de CulturesFrance, mais il est a present charge de trois nouvelles missions: soutenir la diffusion de la langue francaise, renforcer la place de la France dans le debat des idees et former les personnels qui concourent a la diplomatie culturelle francaise. L`experimentation sur le rattachement du reseau culturel public a l`Institut francais etait prevue a l`origine pour 3 ans. Mais en 2013, M. Laurent Fabius, ministre des Affaires etrangeres et du Developpement international de l`epoque, a prononce l`avis negatif sur l`elargissement de cette experimentation. Ou en etait l`Institut francais ? Celui-ci a souffert, comme bien avant la reforme, d`une restriction budgetaire, d`une soumission aux ambassades, d`une gestion du personnel et d`un manque de professionnalisation. La crise du financement de l`action culturelle exterieure s`est accompagnee d`une crise de legitimite de cette meme action. Par ailleurs, malgre l`initiative de M. Kouchner, l`Institut francais depend toujours du Ministere des Affaires etrangeres, ce qui l`a prive d`une autonomie reelle.Or, il serait important de saisir le fait qu`a la difference du British Council et du Goethe Institut qui sont le modele de l`Institut francais, la France a depuis longtemps une tradition interventionniste publique dans sa diplomatie culturelle, et elle possede egalement d`autres types de centres culturels et d`institut, comme l`Alliance francaise. Cela veut dire que les actions culturelles exterieures peuvent se superposer selon les caracteres des etablissements, malgre la creation de l`Institut francais, et que le pilotage du reseau culturel a l`etranger est beaucoup plus complexe qu`en Angleterre ou en Allemagne.Comme l`a note Anne Gazeau-Secret, lorsque nous parlons de la culture, nous pensons tout d`abord a la France. Il ne faudrait donc pas oublier que la reforme “modeste” de 2010 n`est pas un echec total. En se basant sur ce defi inacheve et sur la longue tradition de la diplomatie culturelle, au lieu de poursuivre les modeles d`autres pays, il serait necessaire de developper un reseau culturel mieux adapte a l`administration de la France avec une strategie diplomatique plus concrete et legitime, bien evidemment, a la condition que le budget soit assure."

However, criticisms are being raised about the establishment of zoning, especially among the governments with limited land use and supporters of liberal political positions. In the United States, the first set of land-use zoning regulations could be found in an ordinance enacted in 1916 in New York. The purpose of this ordinance was to prevent the right of sunshine and air from being obstructed by high rise buildings. From the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century, America was a time when commercial facilities and factories grew and big cities developed with rapid industrial development. However, poverty was also serious due to rapid industrial development and urbanization. The Standard State Zoning Enabling Act, which is the model corporation of the land use planning program under this age, was enacted and adopted in many areas in the 1920s.  In the United States, ownership is guaranteed by private property rights, but strong land use regulations that are unlikely to be applied in Korea are applied as in the above-mentioned regulations.  In this study, I decided to discuss land use zoning regulation as US land use regulation. Land use zoning was born in the 1920s to solve urban problems with rapid urbanization since the Industrial Revolution. The partial fragment of zoning as a land use has existed since the colonial era, and the zoning that began in the center of the city became the center of modern urban planning since it was used in the municipalities of the suburbs developed around the 1920s and 1930s.  It used to be the emerging middle class that was largely out of the confusion of big cities and used zoning to protect the residential environment. On the other hand, “exclusionary zoning” has emerged as a tool to rule out the poor, and examples of court cases surrounding the effectiveness of such zoning have been introduced. In the following, I want to find out and introduce the case law of the United States in the modern institutional transformation that is used as a means of new urban renewal called “inclusionary zoning” in the area setting for exclusive purpose."

Therefore, it is important for consumers to know how to satisfy the value of the product, the quality of service, or their emotions, rather than what value the brand is seeking and what it is doing to realize its value. I expect to see some 'touching'. And, as the consumer needs change, the marketing strategy of the brand needs to change as well. Philip Kotler presents ‘3i’ and ‘Value-based Matrix’ models in the 3.0 market, and when the three elements of ‘Brand Identity’, ‘Brand Image’ and 'Brand Integrity' are harmoniously constructed, In this study, we focus on the case of Vans, a global brand that constructs these models effectively using cultural contents. ‘Vans’ transformed the existing young, negative, and rebellious image into values of ‘freedom’, ‘individuality’, ‘self-expression’, ‘cooperation’, ‘creativity’, and ‘enthusiasm’. And it is strengthening ‘brand identity’ and ‘brand image’ in cultural contents of various fields such as image, exhibition, education, festival, space. Furthermore, we build up ‘brand value’ by realizing ‘pursuit value’ of the brand in the local community.In this study, we investigate how ‘Vans’ embodies the ‘pursuit value’ of the brand in cultural contents and how it conveys it to the consumers, so that they can identify three elements of ‘3i’ model ‘brand identity’, ‘brand image’ Will be proving effective.For this purpose, this study divides the way Vans uses cultural contents into video, exhibition, education, festival, and spatial contents, and analyzes what kind of ‘pursuit value’ of brand contains and how it is delivered to consumers."

To our knowledge, this is the highest value reported so far for Congo red adsorption. The acquired data have been evaluated applying various models for adsorption kinetics and thermodynamic studies. The isotherm models as well as acquired Fourier transform infrared spectra suggest that both chemi- and physisorption occur for Congo red adsorption on iron nanoparticles, where chemisorption appears to be dominant. The kinetics of adsorption of Congo red on both bcc-structured and amorphous iron follow a pseudo-second order equation and are characterized by high initial adsorption rates. Diffusion studies indicate that adsorption occurs in two stages, namely film diffusion followed by intraparticle diffusion. Our studies show that amorphous iron nanoparticles are highly promising for dye adsorption and wastewater treatment applications.</P></▼2>"

Thus, this study articulated the features of the fourth industrial revolution through the literature review, described the subsequent changes in societies and university, and proposed the key tasks of general education to cope with such changes. The fourth revolution would bring about drastic changes in the following: job environment will be transformed and finally require the reform of collegiate system related to the department and divisions; open and shared platform in education will be prevailed due to the emergence of sharing economy; the urbanized and distributed societies will lead the individualized and paced learning; and character education will play a crucial role in overcoming the crisis of humanity due to the exceeding development of human-computer interaction. To cope with such problems, general education should encourage students to enhance the key competencies and prepare the interdisciplinary courses so that students can design and implement the self-direct curriculum. Universities should collaborate to develop curriculums and courses applicable for the open platform of education as a pedagogical symbiosis. Assessment frameworks to clarify the learning outcomes of individuals should be developed for the effective paced learning. As well, literacy education for the informed global citizenship should be investigated through the international studies. Last, general education should focus more on character education to cope with the post-human era, and encourage students to participate in collaborative learning. This study suggests a pedagogical model, 5P, to fulfill the tasks of general education."

However, the relationshipbetween visceral adiposity and chemerin levels remains unclear in subjects with T2DM. In this study, we investigated the relationship between serum chemerin levels and visceral adiposity.Materials and Methods: This study included 102 subjects newly diagnosed with T2DM. The relationships between serum chemerin levels and clinical and biochemical parameters were examined. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to determine the predictable factors of serum chemerin levels.Results: Serum chemerin levels showed significant positive correlations with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), visceral fat thickness (VFT), insulin levels, the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, and levels of triglycerides (log-transformed) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, while showing significant negative correlations with high-density lipoproteincholesterol. After adjusting for BMI and WC, VFT showed a significant relationship with serum chemerin levels (r=0.222, p=0.027). Moreover, VFT was an independent predictive factor of serum chemerin levels (β=0.242, p=0.041).Conclusion: We demonstrated that chemerin is linked to metabolic syndrome components. Moreover, serum chemerin levels were associated significantly with obesity, especially visceral adipose tissue, in subjects with T2DM."
integrin alpha 11 in the regulation of the myofibroblast phenotype: implications for fibrotic diseases,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Tissue fibrosis, characterized by excessive accumulation of aberrant extracellular matrix (ECM) produced by myofibroblasts, is a growing cause of mortality worldwide. Understanding the factors that induce myofibroblastic differentiation is paramount to prevent or reverse the fibrogenic process. Integrin-mediated interaction between the ECM and cytoskeleton promotes myofibroblast differentiation. In the present study, we explored the significance of integrin alpha 11 (ITGA11), the integrin alpha subunit that selectively binds to type I collagen during tissue fibrosis in the liver, lungs and kidneys. We showed that ITGA11 was co-localized with α-smooth muscle actin-positive myofibroblasts and was correlatively induced with increasing fibrogenesis in mouse models and human fibrotic organs. Furthermore, transcriptome and protein expression analysis revealed that ITGA11 knockdown in hepatic stellate cells (liver-specific myofibroblasts) markedly reduced transforming growth factor β-induced differentiation and fibrotic parameters. Moreover, ITGA11 knockdown dramatically altered the myofibroblast phenotype, as indicated by the loss of protrusions, attenuated adhesion and migration, and impaired contractility of collagen I matrices.Furthermore, we demonstrated that ITGA11 was regulated by the hedgehog signaling pathway, and inhibition of the hedgehog pathway reduced ITGA11 expression and fibrotic parameters in human hepatic stellate cells in vitro, in liver fibrosis mouse model in vivo and in human liver slices ex vivo. Therefore, we speculated that ITGA11 might be involved in fibrogenic signaling and might act downstream of the hedgehog signaling pathway. These findings highlight the significance of the ITGA11 receptor as a highly promising therapeutic target in organ fibrosis."

To address these concerns, the National Police Agency(NPA) preemptively proposes the transformation from a (centralized) national police force to (decentralized) territorial police forces. With the introduction of decentralized territorial police forces in Korea, there are many potential problems to solve though, and one of them is the issue of financial assistance by central government. In England, the institution of decentralized territorial police forces has long been in place, and so the English police system can be a good model for the NPA in many ways. In this context, the paper tries to explore the UK’s police funding system from central government, including the Police Allocation Formula and the Assets Recovery Incentivisation Scheme Income. Based on the investigation into the English police funding system, the paper finally derives three policy implications of police funding system, noticeably for the era of decentralized police forces in Korea."

After classifying the factors, which affect the problem definition, into ideology, interests, and context, we analyzed how the actors (namely, conservative and progressive parties) have defined the contents of economic democratization. Using a discourse and frame approach, we discussed how the economic democratization, which had been triggered by the alleyway trade protection and the SSM regulation in 2010, have transformed and become a concrete policy as it went through the general election and presidential election in 2012 and the presidential election in 2017. Our major finding is that the discourse of economic democratization in the Korean society has continuously changed by time and the actors, and that it has revolved around three themes: reform of chaebol economy, fair trade and antitrust (market order), protection of small businesses and traders."

These national standards usually reflect national economic conditions and legal and cultural characteristics, but there should be legitimate reasons to maintain such standards and ensure system legitimacy. Therefore, we need to decide whether to choose a competitive legal model or our own economic justice model in light of the system of the MRFTA, but we need to adjust the legal system according to each choice.First, if we intend to remodel the MRFTA by giving priority to the competitive value, the revision should be centered on the type of competition and the prohibition of abuse of market dominant position in Article 3-2 in Chapter 2 should be limited within the exclusionary abuses just like the obstruction of the other competitors' activities or entries, or exclusion of the other competitors. And the Fair Trade Commission should not directly deal with price management. In Chapter 3, we will drastically remove the constraint on the concentration of economic power, which is not related to competition and has little regulatory legislation around the world. In Chapter 5, the prohibition of unfair trade practices must be focused on competitive regulations just as unfairly refusing any transaction, or discrimination against a certain transacting partner, unfairly excluding competitors, and trading under the terms and conditions which unfairly restrict business activities of a transacting party of disrupting business activities of another enterpriser etc.Second, in the case of remodeling the MRFTA by focusing on the value of economic justice, the revision of administrative, tax, criminal and civil regulations will be possible in addition to the existing regulations. Or punitive damages, and indirect purchaser lawsuits or class actions. In addition, the name of the Fair Trade Commission will be transformed into an Economic Justice Commission or an Economic Prosecutor's Commission.However, the important criteria for these two options should be the national consensus, which is the prototype of the law, rather than the theoretical justification. And in both cases, sanctions, particularly penalties, should be minimized to the extent necessary, and legal systematic adjustments, such as balancing behavior and sanctions, will be needed."
a study on the tolerance band of voltage drop during motor startup for refineries and chemical plants with isolated power systems,2017,"['Isolated system', 'Induction motor', 'Inrush current', 'Dynamic characteristic', 'Voltage drop']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Refineries and chemical plants with isolated power systems that have a limited power supply are more susceptible to voltage changes from disturbances compared to power systems connected with a power company. Furthermore, most loads in such cases are induction motor loads, and therefore, transient voltage characteristics when starting a high-capacity motor must be examined. In general, high-capacity motors are customized appropriately to the load performance curve by the manufacturer during the construction of an industrial plant. Subsequently, when complying with the voltage drop permitted by international standards during the design process, power supply equipment such as transformers and generators is overdesigned. Therefore, a novel analysis is necessary on standards for startup and constraint voltage drops, as well as on identifying the voltage drop limitations for starting high-capacity motors in refineries and chemical plants with isolated power systems. In this study, field tests on an industrial plant were conducted,, and simulations modeled under conditions identical to those of the field test system were performed using the general-purpose program ETAP in order to compare the results."

First, by analyzing the `Diskursive Ebene` of `Strukture discursive`, we could confirm the text realization process by changing the meaning of the symbol. In other words, the symbolic prototype of Hakenkreuz was a swastika that meant good fortune, and it became a general and popular pattern of Europe, but it was transformed into a German, excellent bloodline and war by becoming a core symbol of Imperialism Germany. The symbolic prototype of Wookil was a clan pattern meaning sunlight and hope, but it was used as a core symbol of Imperialism Japan, meaning the military, emperor, and war.   We could know the difference between Germany and Japan by analysis of `actant` in `Oberflächenebene` of `Strukture sémio-narrative` about age of Imperialism before the end of World War II and the post-war era of Imperialism. The difference was as follows. Germany was a individual power system, Japan was a collective power system, and due to these differences, Germany rejected Hakenkreuz after the Second World War but Japan continued to obsess about Wookil.  By analysis of `carré sémiotique` in `Tiefenebene` of `Strukture sémio-narrative`, we could confirm the conflict between `excellent` and `inferior` in the background of the common category of the nation. The meta-language of cultural identities in the symbols of Hakenkreuz and Wookil explained the following differences.  First, in the use of emblem, Germany used Hakenkreuz and other elements as `unification` in national flag, the leader flag, and military flag, and then partially modified it, but Japan used national flag, Emperor of Japan flag and Wookil, under the principle of `separation`. Second, there was a difference between Hitler`s `individual power system` and the emperor, the pro-emperor, and the military`s `collective power system` Third, as a method of realizing ideology, Germany pursued the expansion of Imperialism through `elimination` of other peoples but Japan pursued the expansion of Imperialism through `domination` of other peoples.  Fourth, Germany was able to confirm the `disconnection` with Hakenkreuz after World War II, but Japan chose ‘continuity’ of Wookil in the name of tradition.  In this study, the structural semantics of the ideological symbol was analyzed to identify the meta - language of the cultural identity, so that the semantic system within the symbol could be grasped structurally. It also distinguished the differences between Germany and Japanese Imperialism. Therefore, it can be said that we have partially overcome the limitations of the existing icon-based research. However, it is clear that there are still many areas that need to be supplemented to decipher the comprehensive meaning of cultural identity."

The lateral slope feature was defined for effective expression and analysis of the road environment, and the model for the travelable area was created based on the identified features using the pre-analysis information of the traversable area. The sensor data of the unit frame was transformed into a probability map of the movable area by using the generated movable area model, and the map of the travelable area that is sequentially generated was updated with reliable maps through Bayes formula based probabilistic updating. The proposed method was applied as an environment recognition method for autonomous navigation of unmanned vehicles for surveillance and reconnaissance, and obtained results of successful operation in a pavement and off-road environment."

Firstly, the church is the trinitarian community. For Moltmann, the Christian God is the triune God. The Trinity of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit exists as the community in the relationship of perichoresis, which means a dynamic interpenetration and a mutual indwelling. The equally divine three Persons form the perichoretic community and fellowship without uniformity and individualism. Moltmann calls this the social doctrine of the Trinity. The triune God is also an open community. God opens the trinitarian community, enters into the creatures, and invites them to participate in the fellowship and life of the Trinity. Moltmann insists that the Trinity becomes the model or archtype of the church. From this perspective, Moltmann emphasizes the transformation of the church from the hierarchical and bureaucratic form to an open, congregational, or community church. Moltmann also interprets the church as the messianic community. The church is the church of Jesus Christ. Most importantly, the church should work for the liberation of life of all creatures, following Christ in the eschatological vision and in the power of the Spirit of life. Based on his ecclesiology, Moltmann develops his new insight on the Christian mission. He argues that the church should be the missional church. For him, mission is the invitation toward life rather than the expansion of the Christian empire, the expansion of the Christian church, or the evangelization of all human beings. He also understands mission as the work of the liberation of people, society, and all creatures. In the light of the Kingdom of God, for Moltmann, the horizon of mission continues to open widely toward the eschatological completion of the new creation, which will be accomplished when God is all in all. Therefore, Moltmann’s missiology has ecumenical and holistic characteristics. Corresponding to ecclesiology of the Vatican Council II and the missionary vision statement of the WCC 10th Assembly in Busan, Moltmann proposes the new, adequate direction of mission for the future of the contemporary churches in crisis."
preceding intravenous thrombolysis in patients receiving endovascular therapy,2017,"['Preceding intravenous thrombolysis', 'Acute ischemic stroke', 'Comparative effectiveness research', 'Acute stroke therapy', 'Endovascular therapy', 'Functional outcome']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Background: The beneficial effects of endovascular therapy (EVT) in acute ischemic stroke have been demonstrated in recent clinical trials using new-generation thrombectomy devices. However, the comparative effectiveness and safety of preceding intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in this population has rarely been evaluated. Methods: From a prospective multicenter stroke registry database in Korea, we identified patients with acute ischemic stroke who were treated with EVT within 8 h of onset and admitted to 14 participating centers during 2008-2013. The primary outcome was a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 3 months. Major secondary outcomes were successful recanalization defined as a modified Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia score of 2b-3, functional independence (mRS score 0-2), mortality at 3 months, and symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation (SHT) during hospitalization. Multivariable logistic regression analyses using generalized linear mixed models were performed to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of preceding IVT. Results: Of the 639 patients (male, 61%; age 69 +/- 12; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 15 [11-19]) who met the eligibility criteria, 458 received preceding IVT. These patients showed lower mRS scores (adjusted common OR, 1.38 [95% CI 0.98-1.96]). Preceding IVT was associated with successful recanalization (1.96 [1.23-3.11]) and reduced 3-month mortality (0.58 [0.35-0.97]) but not with SHT (0.96 [0.48-1.93]). Conclusion: In patients treated with EVT within 8 of acute ischemic stroke onset, preceding IVT may enhance survival and successful recanalization without additional risk of SHT, and mitigate disability at 3 months.

omija fruit ethanol extract improves adiposity and related metabolic disturbances in mice fed a high-fat diet,2017,"['Brown fat-selective genes', 'Fatty acid oxidation', 'Fecal lipid excretion', 'Insulin resistance', 'Omija fruit ethanol extract']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>This study investigated the biological and molecular mechanisms underlying the antiobesity effect of omija fruit ethanol extract (OFE) in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). C57BL/6J mice were fed an HFD (20% fat, w/w) with or without OFE (500 mg/kg body weight) for 16 weeks. Dietary OFE significantly increased brown adipose tissue weight and energy expenditure while concomitantly decreasing white adipose tissue (WAT) weight and adipocyte size by up-regulating the expression of brown fat-selective genes in WAT. OFE also improved hepatic steatosis and dyslipidemia by enhancing hepatic fatty acid oxidation-related enzymes activity and fecal lipid excretion. In addition to steatosis, OFE decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in the liver. Moreover, OFE improved glucose tolerance and lowered plasma glucose, insulin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, which may be linked to decreases in the activity of hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes and the circulating level of gastric inhibitory polypeptide. These findings suggest that OFE may protect against diet-induced adiposity and related metabolic disturbances by controlling brown-like transformation of WAT, fatty acid oxidation, inflammation in the liver and fecal lipid excretion. Improved insulin resistance may be also associated with its antiobesity effects. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</P>"
fast and robust geometric correction for mosaicking uav images with narrow overlaps,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Image mosaicking is essential for monitoring a wide target area using unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV) images. An image mosaicking process requires accurate and robust geometric correction of individual images with respect to the reference plane. Tiepoint-based geometric correction methods developed so far usually assume wide overlaps between adjacent images. This article focuses on fast monitoring applications where UAVs fly very fast and image mosaics are to be generated immediately. In this case, wide overlaps might not be ensured. For this reason, we investigate a fast and robust geometric correction method for mosaicking UAV images with narrow overlaps. To ensure quickness in geometric correction, an image resampling approach using a resampling grid is presented. To ensure accuracy and robustness in geometric correction, existing transformation models are analysed in depth, and optimal models are proposed. Our proposed method shows the potential for fast monitoring applications. We also show that while existing transformation models work for images with a large overlap, perspective transformation models with full orientation parameters may suffer in images with a narrow overlap. We hope that our results can be useful when implementing an optimal solution that can simultaneously handle UAV images with different overlaps.</P>"
global sliding mode control based on a hyperbolic tangent function for matrix rectifier,2017,"['DC output voltage', 'Global sliding mode control', 'Hyperbolic tangent function', 'Input power factor', 'Matrix rectifier']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The conventional sliding mode control (CSMC) has a number of problems. It may cause dc output voltage ripple and it cannot guarantee the robustness of the whole system for a matrix rectifier (MR). Furthermore, the existence of a filter can decrease the input power factor (IPF). Therefore, a novel global sliding mode control (GSMC) based on a hyperbolic tangent function with IPF compensation for MRs is proposed in this paper. Firstly, due to the reachability and existence of the sliding mode, the condition of the matrix rectifier's robustness and chattering elimination is derived. Secondly, a global switching function is designed and the determination of the transient operation status is given. Then a SMC compensation strategy based on a DQ transformation model is applied to compensate the decreasing IPF. Finally, simulations and experiments are carried out to verify the correctness and effectiveness of the control algorithm. The obtained results show that compared with CSMC, applying the proposed GSMC based on a hyperbolic tangent function for matrix rectifiers can achieve a ripple-free output voltage with a unity IPF. In addition, the rectifier has an excellent robust performance at all times."

Last but not least, the choice of the outcome upholding the value of the biomarkers is extremely difficult, since it has to reflect the mechanistic intervention while being relevant to both the disease and the particular person. On the verge of a new age of asthma healthcare standard, we must embrace and adapt to the key drivers of change. Disease endotypes, biomarkers, and precision medicine represent an emerging model of patient care building on large-scale biologic databases, omics and diverse cellular assays, health information technology, and computational tools for analyzing sizable sets of data.

In the beginning, all the users can connect to a BSor an RN in the most energy efficient way, however, the availabilityof renewable energy is unpredictable, and users connected to anRN will have to be handed over to base stations (BSs) when there isnot enough renewable energy to power the RN. There are also occasionswhen an RN harvested more renewable energy than requiredto server the users connected to it, in these cases users connectedto BS or other RNs can be transferred to connect through this RN,otherwise the harvested surplus renewable energy will be wastedas it cannot be stored.We transform the problem of optimizing theuse of harvested renewable energy into a flow-table managementproblem. A model of harvested renewable energy available for RNsis built first, then we propose a dynamic flow-table updating strategy(DFTUS), which is driven by the availability of renewable energy,to maximize the use of the harvested renewable energy andthus minimize the use of traditional energy. DFTUS can be integratedas an application on top of an SDN controller. Simulationresults show that DFTUS can make more efficient use of renewableenergy thus make the overall relay network more energy efficientcompared with other routing strategies such as the capacity limitedstrategy (CLS) and the optimal path strategy (OPS)."
cloning and functional analysis of two gmdeg genes in soybean [glycine max (l.) merr.],2017,"['Cloning', 'Deg genes', 'Functional analysis', 'Photoinhibition', 'Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Although light is the ultimate substrate in photosynthesis, strong light can also be harmful and lead to photoinhibition. The DEG proteases play important roles in the degradation of misfolded and damaged proteins. In this study, two photoinhibition-related genes from soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], GmDeg1 and GmDeg2, were cloned. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that these two proteases both contain a PDZ domain and are serine proteases. The expression levels of GmDeg1 and GmDeg2 increased significantly after 12 h of photooxidation treatment, indicating that GmDeg1 and GmDeg2 might play protective roles under strong light conditions. In in vitro proteolytic degradation assays, recombinant GmDeg1 and GmDeg2 demonstrated biological activities at temperatures ranging from 20°C to 60°C and at pH 5.0 to 8.0. By contrast, the proteases showed no proteolytic effect in the presence of a serine protease inhibitor. Taken together, these results provided strong evidence that GmDeg1 and GmDeg2 are serine proteases that could degrade the model substrate in vitro, indicating that they might degrade damaged D1 protein and other mis-folded proteins in vivo. Furthermore, GmDeg1 and GmDeg2 were transformed into Arabidopsis thaliana to obtain transgenic plants. Leaves from the transgenic and wild-type plants were subjected to strong light conditions in vitro, and the PSII photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) was measured. The Fv/Fm of the transgenic plants was significantly higher than that of the wild-type plants at most time points. These results imply that GmDeg1 and GmDeg2 would have similar functions to Arabidopsis AtDeg1, thus accelerating the recovery of PSII photochemical efficiency."
serum uric acid relation for hearing threshold shiftt,2017,"['Uric Acid', 'Hearing', 'Antioxidants', 'Neuroprotection']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Objectives. The effects of serum uric acid (UA) level on a variety of diseases were found from experimental and observational studies via oxidative stress and anti-oxidants. However, research on the association of UA and hearing thresholds is relatively sparse. We investigated this issue in the U.S. general population to evaluate the relationship of serum UA levels and pure tone threshold of hearing.Methods. Forty four thousand eighty four eligible participants aged 20 to 69 years who have serum UA data and received Audiometry Examination Component were enrolled from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2004. Hearing thresholds (dB) as a pure tone average at low frequencies (0.5, 1, 2 kHz) and at high frequencies (3, 4, 6, and 8 kHz) were computed. Multivariate linear regression models and tertile-based analysis with an extended-model approach for covariates adjustment were used to assess the correlation between serum UA level and hearing thresholds.Results. In the adjusted mode of tertile-based analysis, the regression coefficients elucidated as the change of log-transformed mean hearing thresholds upon comparing participants in the highest tertile of serum UA to those in the lowest tertile were –0.067 (P=0.023) in high frequency and –0.058 (P=0.054) in low frequency. After adjusting for multiple pertinent covariates, inverse association between tertiles of serum UA and hearing thresholds remained essentially unchanged. The negative trends between serum UA and hearing thresholds were statistically significant (P for trends <0.05) in tertile-based multiple linear regressions.Conclusion. Individuals with elevated UA levels independently were found to be inversely associated with hearing thresholds for pure tone audiometry in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults."

Having this in mind, the purpose of this study is to analyze the continuity of practices in educational policy on secondary schools in the 20th century. This study reveals the characteristics of secondary education policy as follows. First, there was and has been a gap between the intentions of educational policy and the demands of the people whether it was a colonial or liberated government. Second, the artificial and quantitative regulatory policies on vocational education has been repeatedly formulated and pursued despite persistent failure. In conclusion, as of now, we can witness that the traditional dual system of secondary education as a hierarchical and highly discriminative model was transformed into obstacle to reforms to rebuild a democratic education system."

In the ancient era, the public interest in political formulations emerged as a sign of patriotism. Patriotism in the Middle Ages was transformed into a love for patriarchal values. And in the Renaissance era, it was changed to a unique and individual thing, and became a pure concern of human beings. Then, the concept of patriotism could be summarized as a love for a citizen, a subject with a feeling of loyalty or love for the state (and so the existence of the ""state"").  In the following section, this paper has reviewed previous studies on patriotic education and has reconstructed the nation as a subject of patriotism. The moral education in the military has made a large contribution towards the development of the ROK Armed Forces since its foundation.

This Christian-based early childhood geometry education program was designed: A naturalistic model for curriculum development.  The objectives of this program were defined as teaching children of their position and role in the Whole Creation and increasing their interest in the creation world that was formed by geometry. The goals of this program consisted of increasing children’s interest in the origin of geometry and the history of its discovery, enabling them to apprehend geometry concepts based on space and figure activities, and developing their mathematical disposition based on geometry concepts. The educational content of this program consisted of the creativity and discovery of geometry, location and visualization as space elements, shapes and transformation as figure elements, and the utilization and direction of geometry knowledge and skills. The teaching-learning method of the program was organized by integrating a Christian instructional model and the teaching-learning method of the early childhood geometry education program. The basic principles of the teaching-learning method of the program were the process, strategies, and materials of teaching-learning. The basic principles of teaching - learning were interaction, context, community, individual differences, emphasis, exploration, and integration. The process of teaching-learning involved getting the children’s attention, obtaining knowledge, and movement. Storytelling, cooperative learning, reconstruction, and emotional evaluation regarding activities were used as teaching strategies. The creation story, photos, pictures, models, and data produced by infants were used as teaching materials. The program evaluation methods were chosen as formal and informal methods.  The study identified the environment surrounding infants as a geometric creation of the universe and provided a Christian perspective on infant mathematics disposition and infant geometric education. Therefore, the study identified the environment surrounding infants as a geometric creation of the universe and provided a Christian perspective of childhood and early childhood Christian perspectives."

Its starting point can be traced back to Christo & Jeanne-Claude’s 〈Umbrella Project〉 (1991) in which artwork was displayed in a rural area. The Art Front Gallery led by Kitagawa FRAM supported the 〈Umbrella Project〉, which served as a precedent to the Echigo Tsumari Art Triennale and the Seto Inland Sea International Art Festival. These art festivals taking place in the empty houses or abandoned schools after renovation provided a common platform for both art and architecture. In conjunction with the opening of the Triennale, new buildings, such as Matsudai Yukiguni Agricultural Culture Village Center and Kyororo, was erected. Benesse Art Site Naoshima sponsored by Fukutake Foundation played a role in transforming the Seto Inland Sea into the center of art by commissioning the world renowned architects including Ando Tadao and SANAA to create wonderful artistic sites. In particular, architect Nishizawa Ryue and artist Naito Rei worked together to realize a miraculous art museum in Teshima.  In the post bubble era, as the number of architectural projects decreased, young architects born in the 1960s, such as Atelier Bow Wow and Mikan Gumi, try to find a new venue in the international Biennials or Triennales and the realm of exhibition display. The reason why art festivals have flourished is because they were easy to maintain and cost efficient compared with building new museums and galleries.  I would like to discuss the relationship between art and architecture by tracing exhibitions in which I have been involved. From 2002 to 2006, I served as a committee member at the KPO Kirin Gallery in Osaka and staged exhibitions featuring works by Atelier Bow Wow, Yamamoto Katsuhiro, Endo Souhei, and Fujimoto Sosuke, with an intention to impress ordinary people. Since I organized architectural shows at the art gallery, I could not help but comparing how these two disciplines used the same space differently. If art exhibitions feature original works as a commodity, architectural exhibitions feature only replaceable models or drawings. Yet, Ishigami Junya’s work was an exception to this distinction in that his design of a table could be literally displayed in the gallery space like an art object and at the same time it was an architectural work that included complicate structural concern. In 2008, when I undertook the commissioner of the Venice Biennale, I put Ishigami’s life-size green house on display.  In 2013, as an art director, I dedicated myself to the Aichi Triennale whose main theme was 3.11. I raised the issue of how architecture could engage in art festivals by renovating exhibition buildings and creating experimental spaces. In 2017, I got involved in two artistic events, Mayfly Cluster and Ten Year Anniversary of Windowology. In hindsight. the intersection between art and architecture has offered a new venue for both disciplines."
effect of hil-10 in transgenic pig cells to inhibits pro-inflammatory response induced by human macrophages,2017,"['hIL-10', 'Macrophage', 'Xenotransplantation', 'Porcine']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Xenotransplantation has been considered as an alternative to moderate shortage of donor organ for transplantation. To achieve successful xenotransplatation, we need to overcome immune rejection. Even though, hyperacute rejection has been overcome by α1,3-galactosyltransferase knockout pig, cellular immune rejection still remains as a subsequent barrier. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is known as anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokine which has been shown to limit inflammatory responses by inhibiting macrophage activation in several animal experiments. To study of effect of human IL-10 (hIL-10) on pig-to-human xenotransplantation, we estabilished porcine kidney epithelial cell line (PK15) expressing hIL-10. When the cells were co-cultured with human monocyte-derived macrophages by phorbol myristate acetate activation, the cytotoxicity of macrophages was decreased by hIL-10. Furthermore, there is a decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-23, and increased anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10, but not transforming growth factor beta, in the presence of hIL-10. Also, macrophage polarization toward M2-like phenotype were induced by hIL-10 from transgenic PK15 cells. Finally, we found that hIL-10 expressing from porcine cells induces the macrophage polarization into M2-like macrophages, reducing the cytotoxic effect of human macrophages. Therefore, these findings suggest that hIL-10 transgenic pig seems to be considered as an useful model to overcome xenograft rejection."

Humanism is the world view that emphasizes `humanity` or `human dignity`, starting with the humanism of the Renaissance period in the 14th and 16th centuries, and mental attitudes that were associated with the rational spirit of modern science in the 17th and 18th centuries. Posthumanism raises doubt about humanism as the mythical concept naturalizing anthropomorphism, so that deconstructs the universal human nature advocated in humanism. Given that the concept of human species is a historical concept and its ideological effects are seen as oppressive, `difference`, `specificity`, `multiplicity`, and `plurality` are foregrounded as having particular importance in posthumanism. Along with critical attitudes toward modern humanism, recent advances in technology are also helping to model posthumanism as an alternative view of humanism. Today`s rapidly bio-, nano-, info-, cogno-, digital-, virtualtechnology, such as cloning technology, stem cell technology, AI, organ transplantation, mobile media, brain science, cyberculture, online, network, have made it indispensible the role of technology in the discussion of the change of human nature after humanism. Unlike previous theatrical performances, technology on the stage of posthumanism changes itself not as means of assisting stage aesthetics, but as the fundamental purpose of performance. Contrasting with traditional theatre which used technology for stage figuring, technology transformed from analog to digital is acquiring agent that interacts with human actors. It is particularly interesting that various performances are emerging to understand integration and encounter between body and technology or human and machine in the robot performances. These robot performances need subtle attentions because they dramatically alter the concepts of modern drama related to representation, presence, the temporal-spatial quality of stage, and the aspects of acceptance of audience. This paper will examine how the new aesthetics of posthumanistic performances is achieved when robots appear as actors in performance. The aim of this paper is to study on how the `presence` of the body and the spatial `atmosphere` stemming from the presence are transformed, considering the performances of robots. Through these discussions, this paper will think of how the concepts in relation to the concepts of classical phenomenology, such as consciousness, experience and phenomenon, are changed. In other words, through the interrelationship between technological science and phenomenology, phenomenology of cyborg performance will be presented as the aesthetics of robot performance. The moment when the audience experiences the conscious phenomenon with the diffraction is thought as the moment of transformation crossing the threshold for the audience. Consequently, the moment is the point where the aesthetics of performance by posthuman might be guessed. This article will therefore have some significance functioning to trigger other discussions on the performance of robot in the posthumanistic era."

However, this criticism neglects the intent of a poet who wanted to accommodate tragedy of life as the essential drive of the religion, without forgetting fundamental sadness of an existence. The base of Ji-Yong Jeong""s catholicism is the understanding that ""religion and sadness"", which look like to be in confrontation with each other, in fact, belong to each other and can coexist. Ji-Yong Jeong""s catholicism admits fatalistic tragedy of life as the intrinsic motive of the religion. The religion he sought goes toward the God, accommodating ugliness contained in tragedy of life, rather than denying it. In the accelerating process that transforms from discontinuity of ""sadness/religion, reality/ideal or hopeless/transcendence"" to continuity between them, the dualistic structure of ""Heaven/Earth"" collapses and a close relationship of mutual belonging arises. Catholic poetic spirit starts from this relationship of love. The one thing that should not be neglected is that religious ecstasy comes from sadness of the ego. He poetically confesses that people can truly experience a transcendental existence and its love when they accommodates such tragedy as the essence of life without denying it, rather than forgetting or avoiding troubles given to them."

Lack of recognition of women`s capacities, discriminatory social norms, and deep-rooted structural inequalities limited women`s mobility and access to both regular development and humanitarian crisis services in Nepal. Despite the fact that women were one of the most vulnerable groups impacted by the disaster, their significant roles in relief, response and recovery efforts as well as resilience building enabled them to serve as active agents of change.

This question has been hotly discussed since the 1990s centering on the installation ritual of Buddhist images in Indo-Tibetan Esoteric Buddhism or on the objects yielded from inner recesses of Chinese and Japanese Buddhist images. There are few textual evidences for such rituals for Chinese and Japanese examples, making it difficult to examine scriptural basis or doctrinal background of them. In contrast, the Korean tradition of bokjang or the practice of interring objects within Buddhist images provides us a rare opportunity to compare a ritual manual called Josang gyeong with extant bokjang deposits yielded from Goryeo and Joseon Buddhist statues. The distinctive composition of the bokjang, shown in both the ritual manual and remaining objects, has led scholars to characterize this important ritual tradition as a unique product of Korean Buddhism. Most Korean scholars define bokjang as consecration, a ritual to invest a material image with sacred presence of the divine. This view accords well with a pervasive explanatory model in the Western academia that often describes the consecration as a ritual tool to animate, enliven, or empower an inert image. The emergence of this view, which I call a ritualistic view of Buddhist images, marks a significant turning point in the history of Korean Buddhist image-making practices. I have argued elsewhere that a ritual idea, derived from late Indian Esoteric Buddhism and transmitted to the Korean peninsula through Chinese translations of scriptures and manuals during the Song and Liao periods, have played a vital role in the transformation of Korean Buddhists’ perception of Buddhist images. This article aims to reconsider the overall structure of the bokjang ritual in light of pratiṣṭhā or the ritual of image-installation in Indian Esoteric Buddhism. This line of inquiry helps us better understand how the formation of bokjang ritual and its spread transformed the medieval Korean perception of Buddhist images and the practice of making images."

But recently the construct called brand culture corresponding to organizational culture has showed up in the field of marketing for the purpose of connection internal activities in organization with external activities in the market. In this context, even the term of brand commitment has emerged in corresponding to organizational commitment. Accordingly, this study explored not only the constructs in the field of organizational behavior to improve organizational commitment, but also the effects of them on brand champion behavior to play a role in linking internal activities with external activities. As a result, leadership style and internal communication were found for internal branding activities related to organizational commitment that improve employees' brand champion behavior. As for leadership style and organizational committment, the subconstructs were confirmed in transformational leadership and transactional leadership in leadership style, and affective committment, normative commitment, and continuance commitment in organizational commitment. Nevertheless, the existing studies tended to apply measures consisted of several subconstructs to single construct. In this reason, the discriminant validity among subconstructs has been necessarily not confirmed in the results of the existing studies related to leadership style and organizational commitment. Accordingly, this study introduced the high-order construct equational model for leadership style and organizational commitment in basis of nomological validity of subconstructs confirmed by the existing studies. Also, the employees in finance service company, the object of investigation, are classified in two group(office worker and financial planner). It is important for the office worker to do task unit of their department, but for the financial planners to assign their most of time to do the service on touch point with customers. Because these job characteristics could make the difference in the same organization, we conducted the group comparison for the path coefficients to assess the moderating effect of job characteristics. The findings suggest that leadership style and internal communication affect brand champion behavior as well as organizational commitment. Furthermore, the moderating effect of job characteristics was confirmed. In basis of theses findings, we suggested the limitation of this study and the direction for future study after discussing the significance and implication of this study in the conclusion."

To prevent landslide disasters more efficiently, more studies in relation to predicting the initiation areas of debris flows that cause large-scale damage are necessary. The main purpose of this study is to develop a criterion for detecting debris flow initiation areas by using an empirical method that was chosen from several types of approaches to debris flow initiation detection. In this study, ten GIS-based geomorphological datasets were obtained from slide and debris flow initiation areas located in Seoul, Gyeonggi Province and Gangwon Province. The geomorphological characteristics of slide and debris flow occurrence areas were analyzed through a comparative analysis to identify relationships between debris flow initiation and each topographic index. An initiation criterion for debris flows based on the geomorphological characteristics was suggested using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model combined with a modified threshold for the relationship between slope and upslope contributing area. To validate the suitability of the initiation criterion for debris flow, sequential applications of slope failure analysis and debris flow initiation analysis were conducted on a case study site to simulate the actual debris flow events.

sequential treatment for landfill leachate by applying coagulation-adsorption process,2017,"['Landfill leachate', 'sequential treatment', 'coagulation–flocculation', 'adsorption', 'PAC', 'zeolite']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Landfill leachate has always been the most problematic factor in municipal solid waste management. Leachate generated from landfills generally contains high amount of organic and inorganic compounds that might cause pollution to water resources. In the current study, sequential treatment of landfill leachate using coagulation–flocculations a pretreatment process followed by adsorption process was used to treat chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonical nitrogen (NH3-N) and color from raw landfill leachate. Coagulation–flocculation process was examined using alum and ferric chloride. The optimum working pH for the tested coagulants was 5 and FeCl3 showed higher removal efficiency for landfill leachate than alum. The pretreated leachate was further treated via two types of adsorbents i.e., powdered activated carbon (PAC) and zeolite. The optimum experimental conditions for PAC and zeolite adsorptions were found to be 40 g/L at 30 min and 80 g/L at 120 min, respectively. Scanning electron microscope and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy tests were conducted to examine the surface morphology and chemical properties of the adsorbents. The results showed that the Freundlich isotherm was best fitted for PAC adsorption while Langmuir isotherm model showed good conformity for zeolite adsorption. Besides, pseudo-second order model was found to be the best fitted kinetic model for both PAC and zeolite adsorption where the R2 was closed to unity for all parameters. On balance, FeCl3 coagulation-PAC adsorption has shown higher removal efficiency for color, COD, and NH3-N as compared to FeCl3 coagulation-zeolite adsorption."

But there were some gaps between theory and practice. To overcome this problem, some opinions are gathered form experts and field engineers and four improvements have been proposed and reflected in the system. First, the previous system consists of one hardware module, so it is hard to install it at a control office and construction equipment at the same time. The server module for the office and the mobile module for construction equipment are separately developed. Second, the transportation algorithm that is used in the previous system can generate shortest paths for the earthwork distribution, but embankment areas are not gathered. This situation leads to a decrease in compaction productivity. A modified algorithm for earthwork distribution is suggested. Third, the automated coordinate transformation is performed to show the position of construction equipment on the 3D terrain in real-time. Fourth,construction equipment groups should be formed in the initial stage of earthwork and the number of equipment of each groups should be changed by operation status and site environment. But this functions did not work properly in the previous system. This problem is corrected in the proposed system. The improvements can make the proposed system much more realistic one and can leads to anincrease in the productivity of earthwork perations."

The results of the research and analysis were as follows: The first research question sought to identify the leadership types of female principals. The participants scored higher in the transformational leadership factors than the transactional leadership factors, as measured by the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ). The second, the perceptions of the participants regarding their strengths related to the affective domain, such as love of the teaching profession, recognition and compliments, consideration, initiative, etc. On the one hand, female principals’ weaknesses were perceived to be greed, lack of coping during crises, narrow personal relationships etc. The third, research question sought to discover what female principals perceived to be the differences in the leadership characteristics of male and female principals. Some participants said that the differences were more related to personality than gender. The participants perceived male principals as quicker to make intuitive decisions, more authoritarian, and more disposed to integrated thinking. The fourth, research question pertained to what female principals perceived to be the major barriers to achieve school leadership positions. Attitudes and beliefs concerning women’s gender roles in education, and masculine superiority, bias, and discrimination against women were cited as possible barriers. The fifth, research question sought to discover the best practices currently being used by female principals to develop their leadership skills. The best practices identified were collaboration with as strong role- models, education program seminars, and books and written resources. This study also identified a distinct lack of a formal system to develop the leadership of female principals, and suggests what steps should be taken for developing their leadership skills."

Using a structural VAR model which includes wage share, capital accumulation, consumption, export, and household debt, we analyzed the effect of household debt on aggregate demand and its possibility of transforming the demand regime in Korea from 1999 to 2015. Though we find the characteristics of wage-led demand regime, household debt which is found to have a positive relationship with wage share fails to boost the aggregate demand, which does not accord with the logics of ‘debt-driven growth regime’ (Stockhammer and Wildauer, 2015) or ‘consumption-driven, profit-led growth regime’ models (Kapeller and Schütz , 2015). Furthermore, our counterfactual analysis shows that when household debt is omitted in the empirical distribution-growth approaches, the features of wage-led demand regime may be overestimated, if not misjudging the demand regime per se."
트럼프 신정부의 안보정책 전망과 대응,2017,"['America First', 'Peace Through Strength', 'Maximum Pressure and Engagement', 'THAAD', 'Burden Sharing', 'Transition of Wartime Operational Control']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The emergence of the Trump era which has come to be symbolized by a stance of `America First and Peace through Strength` is both a challenge and opportunity for the ROK-U.S. allianceThe Trump administration`s Maximum Pressure & Engagement Policy toward North Korea aims at sanctions and eventually dialogue. In the meantime, the ROK`s Moon Jae-in administration is attempting to implement sanctions in parallel with dialogue. Both governments` end-state is to achieve peace-making on the peninsula. In the event of the complete disbandment of nuclear and missile development, our two allies are to reach an agreement of a nuclear freeze and non-proliferation through the Six-Party Talks and eventually sign a peace treaty along with North Korea`s denuclearization.Just after Trump`s inauguration, the solidity of the ROK-U.S. alliance and firm commitment to the defense of the ROK was demonstrated through the subsequent visits to Korea by U.S. Secretaries of Defense and State, and the Vice President. The alliance is a backbone of the ROK`s national security and a core pillar of its foreign existence. The alliance transforms not only the deterrence of war but also contributes to achieving a unified Korea. The alliance should be transformed to a strategic alliance so as to cope with international terrorism, the non-proliferation of WMDs, cyber security, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.In the meantime, we should be aware of North Korea`s intent and strategy regarding nuclear and missile development due to its regime survival, deterrence, and negotiation. Also of great importance is its stated goal of unification in a military manner of nuclear and through possible missile preemptive attacks. The situation in which North Korea retains fifty nuclear warheads, ICBMs striking against continental U.S, and 3000 ton SLBM is moving beyond control. North Korea should be prevented from waging nuclear war. In the event of identifying clear-cut indicators of a nuclear-missile attack and crossing such a redline, neutralization operations against nuclear and missile sites should be carried out. Military operations systems should be established, strategic communication should be conducted in order to get a ROK-U.S. and international consensus regarding the urgency of the elimination of nuclear and missile armaments, national determination to wage a total war achieved, and be ready to conduct a neutralization strategy against North Korea`s nuclear program under full-fledged deployment in order to prevent the escalation of war.THAAD deployment is essential to protect Korean people and property as well as U.S. troop protection and survival. The procedure of environment impact assessment and national assembly`s agreement will secure- legitimacy. The ROK should proactively respond against China`s criticism related to X-band radar`s detection inland military activities of China and ROK`s Missile Defense System led by the U.S. Conditionally, China should cross-visit the MD system in the Northeast Province and the THAAD site in Sungjoo in order to confirm the issue of compatibility between AN/TPY-2 Terminal Mode Radar (range of detection, 800 Km) and Forward Based Mode Radar (range of detection, 1,800 Km). The compatibility between the two radars is absolutely impossible.The worst option might also be reviewed. All THAAD systems should be deployed at the Sungjoo site along with operational personnel, except the radar which might be redeployed to an off-peninsula location. The radar during annual exercises, such as the Key-Resolve Exercise, will be deployed to the Sungjoo site to test the interoperability with the THAAD system. The radar will be returned to an alternate site off-peninsula. In the event of identifying clear-cut indicator of high tension on the peninsula, the radar will be promptly deployed to the Sungjoo site. However, the option has intrinsic constraints because the deployment of THAAD is played as a denial deterrence role. The proof of which the ROK has not joined the MD system led by the U.S. is as follows. First, the ROK did not sign an MOU on the MD with the U.S. Second, the ROK has never invested toward research and development related to MD weapons systems. Third, the ROK forces did not connect with the Command and Control, Battle Management Center. The ROK has also maintained its non-member status of MD systems since the Kim Dae-jung era. President Moon Jae-in should proclaim again that the ROK is not joining, and will never join, MD systems.It is highly-likely that the Trump administration will request a drastic rise of the defense burden sharing under consideration of THAAD deployment expenditure request by President Trump. The ROK`s defense burden as of 2016 is roughly 50% - 944 billion won among the two trillion won it costs to host US forces in South Korea. In terms of burden sharing ratio toward GDP, South Korea is the highest: South Korea 0.068%, Japan 0.064%, and Germany 0.016%. The ROK is the largest purchasing country in the world with 36 trillion three-six million won acquisition of U.S. weapons in the past 10 years from 2006 to 2015.Unlike Japan, the land cost for U.S. camps and personnel expenditure for 3,000 Korean Augmentation forces to U.S. Army KATUSA are excluded. The ROK government invested eight trillion 900 billion won, which is more than half of U.S. forces relocation expenditure. All those items, including the expenditure of Sungjoo THAAD site, should be included in order to account for the defense burden. A negotiation strategy is required so that the ratio of defense burden could be raised to more than 75% which is equivalent to one trillion 300-400 billion won. Then, the ROK could insure the presence of strategic assets via rotation deployment and joint employment.Finally, no personnel from the Trump administration has mentioned the transition of wartime operational control(OPCON). It is said of critically that mere discussion of the transition of wartime operations is not appropriate in considering the nuclear crisis. However, considering Trump`s speech emphasizing the responsibility delivered at HQs NATO in May 23, 2017, it looks highly likely that he will address the transition of wartime control. Even though the ROK-U.S. pursues condition-based transitions of OPCON, the judgment and assessment criteria are ambiguous. As long as the North Korean threat remains and the security environment is unlikely to improve, the transition of OPCON will never be implemented.Even though the ROK has spent an overwhelmingly larger amount on its defense budget versus that of North Korea in the past several decades, why does the ROK defend itself relying on a heavy dependence on the U.S. The need for the transition of OPCON is primary to recover the autonomy of the ROK`s military power`s employment. Once transition of OPCON is implemented, then the ROK could take the initiative of unification. In the event of war, the ROK will take the lead in military operations which could prevent China`s PLA intervention. Arms control military talks between the two Koreas could be held. As long as OPCON will be retained by the CFC commander, North Korea will talk only to the U.S. excluding the South. Autonomy will also contribute to expanding the diplomatic landscape.Preparation for the transition of wartime OPCON which fundamentally transforms the national security frame should be handled by the national forces` commander-in-chief himself. It cannot delegate authority to military forces. National level`s transition preparation of transition of wartime OPCON should be made. The president of South Korea should host quarterly conferences for reviewing the transition preparation of wartime OPCON. Areas of confirmation are as follows. ① Encourage a national campaign to enhance the Korean people`s sense of self-reliant national defense ② The function of the NSC should be reinforced, and war guidance systems should be established ③ In order to cope with North Korea`s nuclear challenge, a task force dedicated to nuclear operations should be organized at the Blue House, and early modernization of the three pillars consisting of a Kill-chain, Korea Air Missile Defense system and Korea Massive Retaliation and Punishment, and activation of strategic command ④ The CFC should relocate to the Combat Lab Center building of ROK JCS in order to hand over how to wage war, then readjust the ROK-U.S. command structure from which the future command might be a commander from Chairman, ROK Chiefs of Staff(CJCS) and deputy commander of Future Command by USFK Commander.⑤ Restructure of the higher echelons by exercising CJCS`s unitary commandership over sister service chiefs of staff under his command ⑥ Enhancement of warfighting capabilities, including strategic intelligence assessment, military strategy, operation planning and command leadership for joint-combined operations, ⑦ Self-reliant defense capabilities by gradually increasing the defense budget from 2.4% to 3% versus GNP. ⑧ Rebuilding USFK`s status and developing a strategic alliance to cope with the regional and global security agenda. ⑨ Parallel talks for North Korea`s denuclearization, peace forum, and arms reduction. ⑩ Improvement of the security environment by institutionalizing peaceful cooperation in Northeast Asia through a backbone of the Trilateral Cooperation Secretariat in Seoul since 2011. Then the ROK will implement the transition of wartime operational control within the ROK`s new administration.The emergence of the Trump era, which symbolizes the transformation of alliance based on reciprocity of responsibility and roles requires renewing ROK-U.S. military relations. We should resolve the North Korean nuclear issue and retain national interest through a solid ROK-U.S. alliance and self-reliant foreign and security capabilitiesWhen the ROK-U.S. alliance, which has already contributed to industrialization and democratization through the deterrence of war on the peninsula enables the ROK to achieve a self-reliant defense, the alliance will be a great model for future alliances in the global community."

In terms of content, Japan adopted the National Security Strategy, the comprehensive guideline for the diplomatic affairs and defense policy, on December 17, 2013, for the first time in its history.  Moreover, on July 1, 2014, the Japanese government made the Cabinet-level decision to approve the right of collective self-defense by revising the conventional interpretation of its constitution which prohibits any extraterritorial exercise of the right of defense of the Self-Defense Forces. At the 2+2 Meeting between Japan and the United States on April 27, 2015, both states agreed to revise the Guidelines for the U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation, which was established in November 1978 and revised in September 1997.  These changes will be the core transition point of the post-war Japanese security policy. It is important for Korea to pay attention that they have the possibility to bring about a structural transformation of international relations in East Asia including the Korean Peninsula."

The purpose of this study is to explore how Keats’s concern with the poetic career is figured in his early sonnet writing, and how he fashioned his poetic self by writing sonnets, and also how the specific use of the sonnet form allegorizes the poet’s self-consciousness about his poetic career. The thesis of this study is that Keats, an apothecary with neither born nobility, nor acquired formal classical education, used the sonnet form as a vocational enclosure in which he could make a name for himself. In this study, the beginning stage of Keats’s poetic career is examined by focussing on his early sonnets, and his interaction with the contemporary older poets, especially with Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Hunt. Influences, both conscious and unconscious, provides the early Keats models to copy, to transform, and/or to transcend. (Chonbuk National University)"

First, the Temple Stay Program needs to proceed from the brand perspective in order to deliver value rather than focus on program activities. Second, as part of the development process for specialized programs, I suggest the development of private forests and forest experience programs and the development of specialized food and farm-stay programs. Third, I suggest utilizing local tourism resources and the related management of Temple Stay programs. Fourth, I propose a plan to expand foreign participation. Fifth, I suggest linking the free semester for middle schools and Temple Stay programs for youth. Sixth, I propose more cooperation between local governments and the Temple Stay Program. Seventh, I suggest a market-oriented marketing strategy. Korea’s Temple Stay Program needs to be transformed with a consumer-oriented management system. Eighth, I suggest the formation of Temple Stay operation teams and the training of professional Temple Stay personnel. In my humble estimation, my suggestions for improving Korea’s Temple Stay Program could greatly contribute to establishing policies for related ministries such as the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and the local governments that are in charge of the Temple Stay. In addition, my suggestions can be used as a useful resource for establishing strategies for Temple Stay operation temple and for the continuous growth of Korea’s Temple Stay Program."

Considering that variability of public welfare attitudes has been ignored in previous studies, we analyzed welfare attitudes changes at individual level in Korea. Using the longitudinal data from the Additional Survey of 2010/2013/2016 Korea Welfare Panel Survey, we analyzed the changes in public welfare attitudes during 2010th-2016th years.Major findings are as follows. First, one of the findings from analysis is that the public welfare attitudes are very active and dynamic in Korea. This finding is contradiction to the results of the previous researches that are point to the stability or inertia of the public welfare attitudes in western welfare states and also in Korea. Second, occurrences of the welfare attitudes change are related with various individual characteristics; income status, occupation status, age, region, sex, political ideology, etc.These results from this study on the welfare attitudes change suggest that dynamics of the Korea welfare politics in recent years reflected the dynamic changes in public welfare attitudes. And, they suggest that Korea welfare politics are transformed from the traditional classes welfare politics to the new welfare politics which are influenced by various interests of the socio-demographic groups."
response surface methodology for optimization of stabilizer dosage rates of marginal sand stabilized with sludge ash and fiber based on ucs performances,2017,"['response surface methodology', 'optimization', 'sludge ash', 'fiber', 'sand', 'unconfined compressive strength', 'stabilization']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Optimization of the stabilization materials in terms of their dosage rates specifically used for stabilization applications have become a great interest by the experimenters due to the concerns of strength performance, time and economy for the construction projects. Using a relatively recent optimization technique, Response Surface Methodology (RSM), this paper is mainly focused on investigation of the optimum amounts of stabilizers (Sewage Sludge Ash (SSA) and Polypropylene Fiber (PF)) and Curing Time (CT) that yield to maximum unconfined compressive strength (UCS) for stabilization of a marginal sand (poorly-graded sand). For this purpose, an experimental study has been carried out conducting UCS tests, where the stabilizer proportions are 0-30% for SSA and 0-1% for PF, by total dry weight of sand+SSA. Also, the curing times considered prior to testing are 0, 7 and 14 days. All UCS tests have been performed following the experimental program by central composite design that used the ranges of stabilizer proportions and curing times. On the basis of experimental data, a full quadratic model with natural log transformation and backward analysis has been built through RSM considering the factors of SSA, PF, CT, and the response of UCS. The results indicate that the mathematical model built in this study is statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05) through the analysis of variance (ANOVA), thus it is applicable for optimization process. The findings from the optimization effort demonstrate that the most potential values for SSA, PF and CT are 19.95%, 0.57% and 12.15-day, respectively. The proposed values could be beneficial for the experimenters in practice specifically for preliminary evaluations prior testings of stabilizations."

Civil justice was identified with the Process, linked to the idea of ""public service"". But the great transformations of the 21st Century have been provoked by Globalization. A global and globalized society emerges, in which Justice systems are moving with efficacy and efficien cycriteria and with a tendency toward harmonization, if not homegenenization.And, added to this, gradually new legal actors have been incorporating some functions that in the 20th century were of the exclusive jurisdiction of the State are now outsourced, such as notaries, registrars, mediators, arbitrators, etc appear and have a function in Justice. They were not part of the classical structure of Justice. The old paradigm of liberal justice, established by the State as a power structure, as a political entity, and guarantor of the rights of its citizens, is giving way to a different scenario in which the same States are giving up part of their sovereignty. Now the process is not the only way and judges are not only actors in the world of Justice. It is emerged a ""megaconcept"" of civil justice, in which ADR is a part of it. So, it integrates Jurisdiction and ADR, as a sort of Multi-door-Justice System. ADR methods contribute to a new perspective of Justice of the 21th century, a plural and global perspective, in which judicial process coexist with extrajudicial mechanisms that in some cases permit the avoidance of judicial actions and, in others, simply reduce them. However, there is an important risk: governments can have an economically driven vision of this integration between courts and ADR mechanisms. Public expenses could be reduced. This consideration is not bad, but could be dangerous if we are talki ng about Justice. The governments could seek more efficiency at a lesser cost and this would result in a gap between rich and poor."

Using the theoretical frameworks by De Wispelaere & Noguera(2012) and Torry(2016), the paper reviews the overall features of related discussions at various dimensions, such as financial, strategic, institutional, psychological, and behavioral feasibility. For the financial feasibility, we estimate total amount of budget of the ‘ideal’ model of the BI and ‘transitional’ one, respectively. In terms of strategic feasibility, we confirm the major political roles of BIKN(Basic Income Korean Network) and Mayor Lee Jae Myeong, and emphasize a necessity of solidarity among various strategic actors acting as green, labor, women and citizen. The administrative capacity of the government in the realization of the BI does not have any big issues, and it is necessary to discuss the conformity with the existing welfare programs within the reform discourse of the welfare state. In the case of psychological feasibility, the key frame of the press is quite different according to the tendency of the newspaper, and the public attitudes to the BI are not also the same. Experiments to verify behavioral feasibility are not relatively enough, and more active discussion is required in the process of institutionalization. In the process of transforming ‘production and labor’ oriented paradigm into a ‘distribution’ centered paradigm, an existence of major political agency and a level of social acceptancy are the most important, and efforts to expand the scope of it through active discussions and communication processes seem to be necessary."

I draw particular attention to the process during the second half of the 2000s in which the Korean-Chinese middle managers are being replaced by Han- Chinese who speak Korean. In addition, I examine how the changing ethnic division influences the interpersonal relationships within the company. The organizational model of “Korean manager―Korean-Chinese middle management―Han-Chinese worker” that was dominant after the 1990s has been changing. Korean-Chinese middle managers have been replaced by Han-Chinese. These dynamics constitute another research goal of this paper."

The reason why this paper focuses on such a phenomenon is that the claim that the role of education should be restored as a ladder for social mobility in Korean society is not very effective. The reason for such an argument is twofold. One is the problem of income inequality of the labor market and educational inequality under the crystallized class structure. And the other is that the new inequalities caused by artificial intelligence and robot automation are not enough to solve the problem of inequality by education and training. Unlike the past, where the difference between education and training has led to the differentiation of social status, the newly emerging inequality is the inequality between large capital with capital investment capabilities such as automated robots equipped with artificial intelligence and human labor replaced by it to be. This situation has begun to crack the close link between education and occupational status in the industrialization era. The problem of the corporate ecosystem, in which the monopoly status of large conglomerates in Korea has been strengthened, causes serious obstacles to the transition from school to work. In addition, the newly introduced artificial intelligence and robot automation are weakening the possibilities of social mobility through education while further strengthening the monopoly status enjoyed by large companies. The new task that this situation imposes on our society is the question of the adjustment of the social and economic system. This study suggests that the task of social adjustment and the transformation of social and economic models can not be achieved overnight. It concludes with a paradoxical claim that we should start now because it demands a long-term effort to transform our life dominated by economic values into a life full of social values."

Second, convergence models for Ye‐ak philosophy and the physical education were grasped form the convergence between the physical education and the Korean language, and the integrated education between the physical education and the music subject. Third, fostering of human resource for the future society through the physical education is concretely presented in strengthening the activities of teacher learning community in the current school physical education policy and expanding the implementation of unit school autonomous physical education program. Therefore, the convergence of Ye‐ak philosophy and the physical education is an educational activity to foster human resource for the future society, and interdisciplinary integration can be an effective way to contribute to the completion of personality, and it will be possible to construct a beautiful civilized society by transforming sensual pleasure into intellectual and moral self by internalizing humanity (仁) in physical activity."

It was a public art project to transform the devastated site into Land Art, aiming to provide the selected artists with an opportunity to rehabilitate the technologically abused sites through art, while raising concerns over the local community environmental issues.  The project consisted of 2 phases: Phase-1 was a Land Art to transform the damaged site into sculpture, and Phase-2 was designed to establish a mockup to showcase the theme of the Project.  Robert Morris and Herbert Bayer were selected for Phase 1: Morris created the work Untitled to claim desolation caused by industrialization and Bayer designed the project Mill Creek Canyon Earthwork and established the Mill Creek Canyon Park that was used for an entertainment facility for local residents while taking a role of erosion control in the region. For Phase 2, six artists - Iain Baxter, Richard Fleischer, Lawrence Hanson, Mary Miss, Dennis Oppenheim, and Beverly Pepper - were chosen and their earthworks were contributed in the land rehabilitation project. Among the six artists, Beverly Pepper suggested a sculpture modeled after ancient monument “Tell” and Iain Baxter suggested a sculpture highlighting the function of art."

As a matter of fact, we review the evolution process of design creativity as a new opportunity to link the design of the past with skepticism about the design methods of the past. In the end, it has been grouped into three types according to the context of the evolution of the automated mechanical design, 1) model reinforcement type 2) communication enhance type 3) generation multiplication type and each represents the discovery and practical alternatives to design creative cultures as a result of the transformation, analysis and design concepts and methods of changing design concepts.  In conclusion, the design of the artificial intelligence age should go beyond the issue of the domination of capital with the relationship between form and function in the past, and it should be approached as a positive opportunity of breaking down the boundaries of design itself and expanding the communication of public practice for all."

The research topic is the principles of organic composition of battle formation and battlefield operating system by reforming the basic model of ancient battle formation. The research method is comparative analysis by reforming the battlefield operating system of types of disposition such as Obangjindisposition(Bangnjin; battle formation, Jikjin; direct battle formation, Gokjin; bend battle formation, Wonjin; round battle formation, and Yejin; keen battle formation), and Hyunmoojindo; turtle battle formation, Paljindo; all-rounder battle formation, Yookhwajindo; six flowers battle formation, Gugunjindo; nine forms battle formation. From the study results, Standoff Bombing of the battle formation in the late Joseon Dynasty basically started out from magic battle formation, but was then transformed into square, rectangle, pentagon, and circle. Also, the battle array composition used a 5-linear structure and was composed of 5 systems of circulation such as rectangle, square, diagonal, curve, and circle. The research findings elucidate the battlefield of the Joseon dynasty by establishing the real battle formation, and thus have military and academic value in suggesting possible tactics that can be used by modern training of military."

In this vein, this study aims to understand the practice, outcome, and contexts of ‘Musical’ education of K middle-school in a low-income area. This school has conducted Musical education successfully as humanity education by making efforts to make education educational, through integrating ‘creative activity education’ and various subjects education into musical activity and festival. Only if it could be understood how humanity education has been planned and implemented in the concrete context of school, the research results might contribute to practising and expanding this model to the other schools. As results of research, it is revealed that adopting new perspective of music education and autonomous form of festival has enabled various subjects and creative activity education to be placed properly in the process of musical education, and consequently self-respect, self-management, problem solving as well as collective experience of achievement have been developed. Also it is identified that such a successful implementation and settlement of musical in the curriculum and tradition of K-school can be possible due to the music teacher’s reflection on the essence and object of music education, indomitable trials and errors of the association for studying music subject, institutional and financial support to such efforts of teachers and transforming their accumulated experiences into a manual, and finally school principal’s trust and support."

Graham Allison, a renowned Harvard University professor, described the North Korean nuclear missile problem as “a Cuban missile crisis in slow motion.” The purpose of this essay is to examine the origin of the North Korea’s nuclear missile crisis whose beginning can be traced back to the failed ‘Joint Declaration on The Denuclearization of The Korean Peninsula’ in 1991 within the context of ‘the Second Nuclear Age’, review the dynamic change that the North Korean crisis has brought upon the U.S. and North Korea in terms of strategic calculus, and to undertake in-depth analysis regarding the potential problems that are underneath the theory and practice in the traditional extended deterrence strategy of the U.S. The single most important question to be raised with respect to the research purpose is “Why are majority of South Koreans becoming increasingly nervous in the face of mounting threats from the North despite the rock-solid nature of ROK-US alliance system and the extended nuclear deterrence in the form of nuclear umbrella, that are promised, assured and reassured repeatedly?” The findings of this study revealed potential problems both in the theory and the practice of traditional deterrence strategy. Most of all, from the theory side, as evidenced by the Prospect Theory, the success and failure of deterrence can be reversed when the assumption of rationality is undermined. In addition, Danilovic’s dynamic extended deterrence model identified the existence of 'gray area' which has been in the blind spot which proved to be difficult to capture by means of typical dichotomous success or failure.The examination of the practice in the extended deterrence strategy, especially (1) de Gaulle’s Doubts, (2) a ‘leaky’ U.S. Umbrella, and (3) Healey’s Theorem, strongly implies the inevitable existence of structural gap between the extended deterrence that the U.S. believes to be sufficient to resolve the security threats against the allies, and that the allies perceive to be sufficient to counter the same threats.In short, the root cause of crisis posed by the North Korea is stemming from the Kim Jong-un regime’s anomalous and detrimental nuclear monopoly in the Korean peninsula. It seems that the resolution of the ongoing crisis would be virtually impossible unless the strategic nuclear unbalance due to the North Korea's nuclear monopoly is not addressed in due course. For that purpose, it is time for the ROK and the U.S. to transform the security paradigm in a dramatic manner. For instance, two allies must understand and accept the fact that the nuclear burden-sharing such as the reintroduction of tactical (or non-strategic) nuclear weapons into the Korean soil is not mutually exclusive but complementary with denuclearization policy."

Iguana motion data captured using a small number of markers cannot express its movement precisely, and even with a realistic skin mesh, it shows unnatural movement because of limited degrees of freedom. In order to solve this problem, we propose to simulate a natural and flexible movement by applying a soft-body simulation technique which models the movement of an iguana according to muscle forces and body’s elastic forces. We construct a motion graph from the motion capture data to describe the iguana’s various movements, and utilize it to select appropriate movements when the iguana moves. A target point on a terrain is set from the user’s input, and a graph path is planned based on it. As a result, the input movement of iguana walking on a flat ground transforms to a movement that is adapted in an online manner to the irregular heights of the terrain. Such a movement is used to calculate the ideal muscle lengths that are needed for soft-body simulation. Lastly, a tetrahedral mesh of the iguana is physically simulated to adapt to various situations by applying a soft-body simulation technique."

Migration is not an exclusive product of the modern world, but migration had also played the counterpart of the sedentary lives. Migration and lives of the migrants in ancient societies, and its understanding reveals that it was the major lifeway. After moving to another place, the migrants must have faced many problems including discrimination against them, and they had to deal with adaptation and assimilation issues, social and cultural conflicts between the locals and the migrants, formation of migrants group, cultural transformation of the migrants, multiple identities of the migrant groups. New location where the migrants had settled came as a new living environment, and in the meanwhile, it became the cultural space which can be extended to the memorial space with a sense of nostalgia for their homeland. Throughout the history of Goguryeo, there were numerous migrations. Adding up such groups either undocumented or lacking preserved archeological remains is even led to higher migration rates. Either voluntarily or involuntarily migrated population from both directions might also have been large. Goguryeo had embraced not only Chinese people, but also people from surrounding states such as Kitan, Turks, Mohe, Silla, Baekje, and Buyeo. Due to complicated diplomatic relationship with adjacent countries, Goguryeo was prone to embrace refugees and utilize their diverse cultural abilities for establishing harmoniously co-existing communities. The types of Chinese migrants to Goguryeo and pushing factors of their migration are shown varied. Their lives appeared to have had more privileged than those of Goguryeo migrants to China. The difference is presumed to be derived from the fact that Chinese refugees had strongly held the mindset of the mainland Chinese and culturally far more advanced. Adding to this, Goguryeo’s migration policies allowed the autonomous and half-independently administration schemes for migration groups. These factors contributed to establish a positive diaspora. In particular, we can assume that their diaspora was formed well because documents and archaeological evidence clearly illustrates the context of forming a powerful and distinctive group with same political, economic, social and cultural aspects. On the other hand there is a wide range of lives who migrated from China. In particular, it is hard to generalize the identities of Goguryeo people which appear very diverse. Some had led Goguryeo independent campaign and others who went to Silla, founded the country called Shindeokguk. Amongst Goguryeo defectors who went to china, the upper class was assimilated into the Chinese society, while maintaining their identity as refugees from Goguryeo, They had resided in the capital, were appointed as bureaucrats, married to Chinese, and even were buried in Mangshan mountain with their names inscribed in gravestones. Their lives were similar with bureaucrats ofTang Dynasty Chinese. The identity of Goguryeo refugee has been faded and its assimilation into Chinese society had been accelerated over generations.In particular, the absence of homeland and subsequent loss of the network to the previous homeland had accelerated their integration into Chinese society. In addition, the identity of Goguryeo people was sometimes featured as the enemy or the forced migrant from a demolished nation. Their fierce drive to be assimilated into the natives can be imagined."

The original structure of the Exchange was modeled after the Antwerp Bourse according to Gresham’s intention whereas the second structure reconstructed after the Great Fire of 1666 was designed by the city’s homegrown artisan, Edward Jerman. Although the architectural transformation of the Royal Exchange has received much attention in the architectural history of England. Jerman’s use of architectural vocabularies in the Exchange has been often dismissed as representing the coarse hands of an artisan. This study gives a new light on Jerman’s design for the Royal Exchange by addressing the notion of theatricality found in the representations of the Royal Exchange. This is an alternative way to reconsider current scholarship on the architectural identity of early modern London. It is my hope that this study of a building developed as the center of social, economic, and cultural production of early modern London can expand our perspective of the architectural identity of early modern London and also of England as a whole."

Greenway system introduced and adopted in various cities around world is considered to have enormous effects on transforming urban structure in a sustainable way. Pohang has grown as an steel industry city focused on industrial efficiency, and now is showing lots of drawbacks such as fragmented structure and a lack of green areas. But Pohang still has lots of potential natural resources and relocated empty areas giving a great opportunity to restructure by greenway system. This study examines Pohang’s present condition and introduces the greenway system plan as a way to make up weak points and to make the most of industry heritages. Proposed greenway system consists of 2-layered ways-citywide and local level. Citywide greenway circulating around the city is composed of 3 characteristic ways, and local greenways are the branches into the inner area. This plan is now in development process and expected to enhance the overall sustainability of Pohang and to be a model for other korean industrial cities’ development."

사적 제135호 부여 궁남지의 정비과정으로 살펴본 전통의 남용과 발명,2017,"['복원', '원지', '전통의 발명', '진성성', '사적지 조경', 'Restoration', 'Palace Pond', 'Authenticity', 'Invention of Tradition', 'A Landscape Architecture of Historic Site']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Regarded as Korea`s traditional pond, Gungnamj Pond was surmised to be “Gungnamji” due to its geological positioning in the south of Hwajisan (花枝山) and relics of the Gwanbuk-ri (官北里) suspected of being components to the historical records of Muwang (武王)`s pond of 『The Chronicles of the Three States [三國史記]』 and Sabi Palace, respectively, yet was subjected to a restoration following a designation to national historic site. This study is focused on the distortion of authenticity identified in the course of the “Gungnamji Pond” restoration and the invention of tradition, whose summarized conclusions are as follows.1. Once called Maraebangjuk (마래방죽), or Macheonji (馬川池) Pond, Gungnamji Pond was existent in the form of a low-level swamp of vast area encompassing 30,000 pyeong during the Japanese colonial period. Hong, Sa-jun, who played a leading role in the restoration of “Gungnamji Pond,” said that even during the 1940s, the remains of the island and stone facilities suspected of being the relics of Gungnamji Pond of the Baekje period were found, and that the traces of forming a royal palace and garden were discovered on top of them. Hong, Sa-jun also expressed an opinion of establishing a parallel between “Gungnamji Pond” and “Maraebangjuk” in connection with a `tale of Seodong [薯童說話]` in the aftermath of the detached palace of Hwajisan, which ultimately operated as a theoretical ground for the restoration of Gungnamj Pond. Assessing through Hong, Sa-jun`s sketch, the form and scale of Maraebangjuk were visible, of which the form was in close proximity to that photographed during the Japanese colonial period.2. The minimized restoration of Gungnamji Pond faced deterrence for the land redevelopment project implemented in the 1960s, and the remainder of the land size is an attestment. The fundamental problem manifest in the restoration of Gungnamji Pond numerously attempted from 1964 through 1967 was the failure of basing the restorative work in the archaeological facts yet in the perspective of the latest generations, ultimately yielding a replication of Hyangwonji Pond of Gyeongbok Palace. More specifically, the methodologies employed in setting an island and a pavilion within a pond, or bridging an island with a land evidenced as to how Gungnamji Pond was modeled after Hyangwonji Pond of Gyeongbok Palace. Furthermore, Chihyanggyo (醉香橋) Bridge referenced in the designing of the bridge was hardly conceived as a form indigenous to the Joseon Dynasty, whose motivation and idea of the misguided restoration design at the time all the more devaluated Gungnamji Pond. Such an utterly pure replication of the design widely known as an ingredient for the traditional landscape was purposive towards the aesthetic symbolism and preference retained by Gyeongbok Palace, which was intended to entitle Gungnamji Pond to a physical status of the value in par with that of Gyeongbok Palace.3. For its detachment to the authenticity as a historical site since its origin, Gungnamji Pond represented distortions of the landscape beauty and tradition even through the restorative process. The restorative process for such a historical monument, devoid of constructive use and certain of distortion, maintains extreme intimacy with the nationalistic cultural policy promoted by the Park, Jeong-hee regime through the 1960s and 1970s. In the context of the “manipulated discussions of tradition,” the Park`s cultural policy transformed the citizens` recollection into an idealized form of the past, further magnifying it at best. Consequently, many of the historical sites emerged as fancy and grand as they possibly could beyond their status quo across the nation, and “Gungnamji Pond” was a victim to this monopolistic government-led cultural policy incrementally sweeping away with new buildings and structures instituted regardless of their original space, and hence, their value."

It is originated from Fashion Art Movement in 1960s of the United States when contemporary art was active making the transmission and development of fashion art possible. Installation art similarly prevailing in 1960s is also closely linked with the development of fashion art. The combination of installation with fashion is the particularly new thing in modern society. Therefore, it deserves great attention and in-depth researches.Through analyzing the modeling features of installation art, this article has firstly obtained seven manifestation characteristics of installation art: substantiality, conceptualization, interactivity, region-specificity, temporality and medium diversity, expansivity. Then after the in-depth researches on a large amount of examples of fashion art, the article has found that characteristics of installation art also exist in fashion artworks. Through researches and interviews, and correspondence analysis by using five-point measurement method, it proved that fashion art has five installation art characteristics: substantiality, conceptualization, interactivity, region-specificity, and medium diversity.Integrate these five installation art characteristics with fashion art, and then with it as the starting point of creation, endow fashion with innovation of time features and transformation capacity to reflect social ideological form so as to extend new innovation mode for explanation of fashion art in contemporary era. This research can help creators view fashion from the brand new artistic perspective, break through traditional thinking model, activate imagination and stimulate creativity, and infuse more inspirations to clothing industry and fashion industry so that it has the great significance of facilitating the development of cultural creative industry."

This study starts from an academic curiosity that are there any new philosophy or theories which can be adopted. 25 years have passed since the police charter was enacted and the internal and external environments of our police have undergone many transformations during this period. In this study, first, we introduce the birth process of our police charter, reestablishing the police spirit, and second, we establish a topological system between the police charter and the charter of the police service.

how social capital works for purchase intention related to sustainable fashion products,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Sustainability is currently regarded as an imperative business goal by multiple stakeholders, comprising investors, customers, and policymakers (Nidumolu, Prahalad, & Rangaswami, 2009; Sheth, Sethia, & Srinivas, 2011). In particular, how effectively the fashion industry deals with the challenges of sustainability will define its success for eras to come. This study focuses on how social power, parasocial interaction, and social capital work for purchase intention of sustainable fashion products in the fashion YouTube context. Specifically, the study investigates the effects of social power on parasocial interaction, the effects of parasocial interaction on social capital, and the effects of social capital on purchase intention for sustainable fashion products and the implications for sustainable fashion marketing and management.Theoretical FrameworkThis study defines social power as types of power that can be employed to exert influence on others. The five social power bases (French & Raven, 1959) are discussed in terms of perceived influence: Expert power refers to someone who is perceived to be an expert, to have expert knowledge, or to possess special information. Legitimate power relates to someone who is perceived to have a legitimate right to impose behavioral requirements. Referent power is associated with someone who is personally identified. Reward power refers to someone who is perceived to have ability and coercive power to someone who is perceived to have the capability to confer punishment.Parasocial interaction concerns the relationship between media personalities and media users (Frederick, Lim, Clavio, & Walsh, 2012; Horton & Wohl, 1956; Jin & Park, 2009). Parasocial interaction can be defined as “immediate, personal, and reciprocal, but these qualities are illusory and presumably not shared by the speaker” (Horton & Strauss, 1957, p. 580; Jin & Park, 2009). Parasocial interaction theory focuses on the way audiences interact, relate to, and develop relationships with a celebrity (Jin & Park, 2009; Lee & Watkins, 2016). Audiences create a strong bond and intimacy with a celebrity while viewing media channels such as TV programs and social interactive media where audiences feel closer to the celebrity (Kassing & Sanderson, 2009; Lee & Watkins, 2016).Social capital refers to “the aggregate of the actual or potential resources linked to possession of a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships” (Bourdieu, 1985, p. 248). Social capital involves the relationship between providing access to resources possessed by the associates and the nature and amount of those resources (Portes, 1998). Social capital can be clarified as an intangible force that helps to bind society together by transforming self-seeking individuals into members of a community with shared interests, shared assumptions about social relations, and a sense of the common good (Etzioni, 1996). Sustainability refers to three dimensions: economic, environmental, and social (Sheth, Sethia, & Srinivas, 2011). Sustainability transforms into a triple bottom line responsibility, with the inference that assessment of business outcomes should be based not only on economic performance, but also on the environmental and social impact. Environmental and social demands from various stakeholders contribute to the pressure for businesses to reflect sustainability. Thus, sustainable marketing practices are defined from economic, environmental, and social perspectives. In this study, effective sustainability measurements involve purchase intention for sustainable products especially emphasizing environmental and social performance. Focused on the effects of social power on parasocial interaction and the effects of parasocial interaction on social capital and purchase intention for sustainable products, this study tests the following hypotheses: H1. Social power (expert, referent, legitimate, and reward) positively influences parasocial interaction. H2. Parasocial interaction positively influences social capital (bonding and bridging). H3. Social capital positively influences purchase intention for sustainable fashion products (environmentally and socially sustainable fashion products). Methods This study used a survey to investigate key questions about the associations among social power, parasocial interaction, social capital, and purchase intention for sustainable fashion products. A total of 230 fashion YouTube users recruited from South Korea participated in the survey. Of the 230 participants, 40 were men (17.4%) and 190 were women (82.6%), with ages ranging from 20 to 39 (mean = 29.43 years). The social power of the fashion YouTuber (e.g., vlogger) was measured through an existing social power scale including expert, referent, legitimate, and reward measures that elicited user responses to 14 items (Goodrich & Mangleburg, 2010). Parasocial interaction was measured on the basis of user responses to six items on an existing 5- point scale that assessed parasocial interaction (Jin & Park, 2009). This study measured social capital on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree), which was adapted from an existing Internet social capital scale (Williams, 2006). Purchase intention was measured using three 7-point semantic differential scales (likely/unlikely, probable/improbable, possible/impossible; MacKenzie, Lutz, & Belch, 1986) after informing participants that they might be purchasing environmentally and socially sustainable products. Results The overall goodness-of-fit for this measurement model was acceptable (Chi-square 1236.138, df = 680, p <0.001, chi/df=1.818, TLI = 0.900, CFI = 0.913, RMSEA = 0.060). The reliability coefficients of all 14 social power measures including expert, referent, legitimate, and reward were 0.871, 0.782, 0.657, and 0.865, respectively. The reliability coefficient of all six parasocial interaction measures was 0.873. The reliability coefficients of all social capital measures were 0.684 for bonding factors and 0.899 for bridging factors. The reliability coefficients of purchase intention of environmentally and socially sustainable product measures were 0.921 and 0.947, respectively. The coefficients indicate acceptable reliability of the measures. This study used partial least squares (PLS) for structural equation modeling, which has good statistical power for samples. Social power, including referent (β = 0.018, p < 0.05) and reward (β = 0.359, p < 0.001), showed statistically positive effects on parasocial interaction. The results partially supported H1. Parasocial interaction showed statistically positive effects on social capital, the bonding factor (β = 0.578, p < 0.001), and the bridging factor (β = 0.651, p < 0.001). Thus, the results supported H2. For parasocial capital, bridging showed statistically positive effects on purchase intention of environmentally (β = 0.233, p < 0.01) and socially (β = 0.284, p < 0.01) sustainable products. Thus, the results partially supported H3 (see Table 1, Figure 1). DiscussionThis study contributes to clarifying the concept of social capital and determining the relationships between social capital and purchase intention for sustainable fashion products. This study contributes to the theoretical foundation and implications of social capital and sustainability. Specifically, social power, including referent and reward, positively influences parasocial interaction. Parasocial interaction has positive effects on social capital. In turn, social capital positively influences purchase intention for sustainable fashion products. This is the first study on the effects of social capital on purchase intention for sustainable fashion products in the fashion YouTube context. This study suggests that social capital is a strong influential variable for purchase intention regarding sustainable fashion products. Thus, fashion marketers should consider social capital management in the fashion YouTube context while tailoring their brand communications to enhance their sustainable marketing and management."

""Jing (經)” means the textual tradition in which the transcendental and universal truth transmitted by Confucius is contained in the Confucian tradition. The Correct Meanings of the Five Classics which was compiled as the symbol of the unified empire of the Tang provided the model of the accumulated cultural tradition and the ideological standard for the elites and transformed the elite into the tool for the governing of the empire. The authority of the Correct Meanings of the Five Classics was collapsed in the mid Tang period and various alternative approaches to the Classics emerged in the Song period. Wang Anshi`s New Meanings of the Three Classics believed that the education of the Classics aims to teach how to think instead of learning the accumulated cultural tradition. The authority of the way of the thinking was guaranteed by the government and Wang Anshi. Zhu Xi presented the new sets of the Classics and his Collected Commentaries on the Four Books fundamentally altered the classical learning and the role of the Classics, The texts composed of the Four Books had been a seminal part of the learning curriculum in the Daoxue tradition since the Cheng brothers. However it was Zhu Xi who established the new system of classical learning in which the Four Books are equal to the Five Classics. Zhu Xi`s Collected Commentaries on the Four Books provides the learning program for the literati elites through which they could build up the literati networks and the public sphere. The locus of the textual authority shifted from the power of the government which supported the unified standard for sage`s transmitted texts to the mind of the literati who internalized the sage`s learning by Zhu Xi`s new set of the Classics. The textual authority of the Confucian Classics in Zhu Xi`s Collected Commentaries on the Four Books was guaranteed by the fact that the Classics could provide the objective and real platform shared by the literati who posed them as the co-governor of the all under the heaven and realized their public and ethical roles in the society."

(연구방법) 본 연구는 점포공유의 공간특성을 알아보기 위해 공유개념이 적용된 소규모점포 사례를 공유공간의 요소를 통해 분석하였다. 이를 위해 공유공간의 개념과 요소, 유형에 대한 이론적 고찰을 확립하였고 선행논문을 통해 공유공간의 요소 8가지 키워드를 도출하였다. 이를 바탕으로 대학가 중심의 지역 젠트리피케이션이 나타나고 있는 마포구 일대의 소규모점포공유 사례 8곳을 선정하여 사례 분석하였다. (결과) 그 결과 소규모점포공유만의 공간적 특성은 한 공간에서 다양한 장르가 복합적으로 구성되어 있다는 점과 공간의 가변성이 높다는 점이다. 또한 공간형태의 구조를 3가지 형태로 나눌 수 있었는데 개별적 판매공간이 발달한 개별구조형, 공통의 판매공간을 사용하는 집약적 형태의 합동구조형, 공간을 운영하는 브랜드 및 가게의 컨셉에 따라 공간을 변형하여 판매공간을 구성하는 변환구조형으로 분류할 수 있었다. (결론) 본 연구를 통해, 사례분석 결과로 공간을 여러 가게가 셰어하는 공유공간은 복합적 공간의 기능성과 가변성의 요소를 갖추고 있어 소규모점포공유의 공간특성에 가장 적합한 형태를 지니고 있다. 이러한 공간특성을 통해 상업공간의 유휴공간을 활용하여 공간의 기능성을 높여 이용자의 체류시간을 늘리고 공간의 활용도를 높일 수 있다. 이는 다양한 프로그램을 통해 이용자의 유희 시간과 경험을 충족시킬 수 있다. 도심의 집약적 공간 활용의 증가와 복합적 공간의 수요 증가로 인해 상업공간 내 소규모점포공유의 영역이 증가할 것이다. 따라서 본 논문은 소규모점포공유공간의 공간특성분석을 통해 공유공간의 활용성을 살펴보았다. 이를 바탕으로 향후 지속적인 점포공유공간의 연구가 진행되길 바란다.","(Background and Purpose) Following the 2000s, the concept of a sharing economy appeared, which led to the use of idle goods, and reflection on overproduction and wasteful consumption in a capitalistic system. The sharing concept expanded to commercial space as the sharing domain, whereupon small stores began sharing space, contributing to the convergence of intensive space use and diverse genres. The changing lifestyles of modern people lead them to seek multidimensional interactive spaces, which require novel experiences based on spatial variability, beyond the mere consumption behavior of product purchasing. In addition, the increase in rental prices due to local gentrification is jeopardizing small businesses. Given this background, the study considered the spatial characteristics of small stores that used a sharing concept, which could significantly inspire the advancement of commercial space in a direction that considers promising sharing concepts that make better use of shared spaces in stores. (Method) This study analyzed the spatial characteristics of small stores that use the sharing concept according to the various elements of the shared space. It defined theoretical speculation associated with the concept, characteristics and types of sharing spaces, and eight key words to describe the characteristics of sharing space, which have been examined in previous research. On this basis, the study analyzed eight examples of small stores sharing space in the Mapo-gu district, where local gentrification in the university town is occurring. (Results) Small stores sharing space contain a multitude of different genres in a single space, which mitigates potential boredom, while providing great variety. In addition, small stores sharing space can use one of three different spatial arrangements: 1. An individualistic structure type that maintains its own distinct sales area. 2. A joint structure type that merges sales areas. 3. A transforming structure type that employs versatile spaces with multiple functions. (Conclusions) The case study indicated that several shops that shared one space displayed elements of functionality and variability associated with complex spaces; therefore, this model is suited to the spatial characteristics of small stores that have a sharing concept. These spatial characteristics make use of commercial idle periods; in other words, small stores that share space can satisfy users’ desires for amusement through various programs. Consequently, the number of commercial sharing areas will increase due to people's need for increased intensive use of space and increased demand for complex spaces. The expansion of the sharing concept is therefore expected to encourage the trend of small stores sharing commercial spaces and increase the availability of sharing spaces."
공익 대 사익 논쟁의 핵심 쟁점들,2017,"['공익', '사익', '실체설', '과정설', '사익의 합', '공익논쟁', '공동체', '개인주의', 'Public Interest', 'Private Interest', 'Substance Theory', 'Process Theory', 'Individualism.']","공공정책의 규범적 결정기준은 공익이라고 표방되고 있다. 최근 시장주의 행정 개혁에 대한 반발로 ‘공익’에 대한 논의가 급속히 증대하자 ‘사익의 집합이 공익’이란 정식에 대한 논쟁이 급속히 대두되었다. 이 논문은 공익 vs. 사익 논쟁의 핵심 쟁점들의 타당성을 도덕적, 논리적 측면에서 포괄적이고도 연역적으로 검토하였다. 첫째, 도덕적 측면에서 볼 때 공익이 사익보다, 실체적 공익론을 표방하는 국가가 사익주의 공익론을 표방하는 국가보다, 공적 인간들이 사적 개인들보다 더 우월하다는 것은 전혀 근거가 없음을 규명하였다. 둘째, 논리적 측면에서 ‘사익의 집합이 공익’이란 정식과 관련하여 7개의 핵심 쟁점을 규명하였다. 갈등 중인 양측의 사익만으로 공익이 형성되는 것이 아니며, 사익들의 집합이 부분최적화에 머무를 위험도 있지만 그것이 인위적 공익 개입으로 인해 나타날 경우보다 반드시 열등하다는 증거가 없으며, 평등권의 특수성을 들어 사익이 공익의 토대임을 부정하는 것은 평등권의 왜곡적 이해에서 비롯된 것이며, ‘기본권’ 의 경우에도 개인의 사익 집합이 공익을 형성한다는 논리는 성립 가능하며, 개인 사익의 집합 과정에 필요한 이익들의 연결 규칙은 사익주의 공익론에도 필수적이므로 이런 규칙의 존재가 곧 개인 사익 외에 공익을 가능케 하는 어떤 다른 속성의 생성(emergence)을 증명하는 것이 되지 못하며, 사익을 추구하는 개인은 동시에 타인과의 명시적 협상을 통해 이익들을 거래하여 국가의 매개 없이도 그 합의 최대화를 기도하는 인간(homo mercatura)이 될 수 있으며, 또 사익을 추구하는 개인이 암묵적으로 좁은 의미의 이기주의를 버리고 타인의 사익도 존중하는 고차원의 이기주의를 스스로 택하는 행동전략으로 바꾸어 양측의 사익 합을 극대화하도록 협력하는 인간(homo conviventia)으로 진화한다는 점이다. 결국 사익의 집합으로부터 공익이 형성될 수밖에 없다는 사익주의 공익론이 재확인되었으며 실체설적 공익론은 도덕적 우월성, 논리적 타당성이 없음을 확인하였다. 실체론적 공익론의 허구를 규명한 뒤, 사익주의 공익론에 의하여 사익이 공익으로 변환되는 기제를 우세이론, 공통이익, 일원개념의 세 가지 수학 모형으로 보였으며 나아가 실제의 정책 과정에서 그것이 표현되는 모습을 합리주의, 이상주의, 현실주의의 세 측면에서 제시하였다. 이 논문의 시사점은 공익연구의 과학화를 위해서는 공익에 대한 의도적 희망이나 사익에 대한 증오보다는 과학적 타당화를 지켜야 하고, 사익주의 공익론의 결점을 지적함을 넘어 실체론적 공익론의 타당성을 적극적으로 증명함이 필요하며, 사익의 제한은 지금보다 훨씬 더 엄밀한 논거 없이는 그 정당성이 더욱 약화될 것이라는 점이다.","The notion of Public Interest appeared as the protestant conceptual tools against market-oriented government reforms, which inevitably call for the public-private interest discourse. Substance Theorists on public interest are those who accept that public interest is made of some components apart from private interests. But Process Theorists are those who consider public interest as aggregation, though not arithmetic sense, of private interests. This article reviews and analyzes, in moral and logical dimensions, comprehensive attacks of Substance Theorists who deny the possibility of private interests being transformed into public interests, then evaluate their validity. In moral dimension, public interest never prevail over private interest, nor the state model public interest theory is based on over the state model private interest theory is based on, nor the ‘public man’ over private man. In logical dimension, 7 critical issues on the formula of “∑Private Interest = Public Interest” were throughly reviewed. The reviews show 7 results as following. Process Theory does not exclude relevant related private interests as was attacked by Substance Theorists. The sub-optimality which may result from the sum of selfish private interests is possible, but it is not clear that necessarily will be worse than results coming from the state intervention lying on the slogan of correction of market failure. When equality is correctly interpreted, it also can be included in “∑Private Interest = Public Interest” scheme. Fundamental Human Rights can also be transformed according to above scheme. The existence of linkage rules among the private interests cannot be the proof that Process Theory is not valid. Private individuals not always defect but cooperate with other individuals, and they can convert themselves into Homo Mercatura. Private individuals can change strategy from All Defect to Tit-For-Tat respecting other private interests, and they can evolve into Homo Convivento. After all, the Substance Theory on public interest turned to be false. The public interest is formed, in practice, through political process, which is considered as public interest not because it qualifies for substantial factors, but it just went through due procedural requirements."
생태박물관 리뉴얼에 있어서 환경적 경험디자인에 관한 연구,2017,"['생태박물관', '체험', '전시디자인', '리뉴얼', '환경적 경험디자인', 'Ecological Museum', 'Experience', 'Exhibition Design', 'Renewal', 'Ambient Experience Design']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"(Background and Purpose) Museums have been expanding into cultural spaces that value various spatial experiences. In recent years, as part of efforts to improve the level of visitors' diverse needs and exhibitions, renewal during the exhibition are expanding in the medium to long term. However, due to the development of accelerated media and changes in viewing behavior, the frequency of contents is shortened, and this satisfies temporary visitors. Currently, many exhibitions are lacking in delivering emotions due to predictable topic delivery and superficial experiences in exhibits, and it is difficult to maintain sustainability of exhibition content and presentation media. This research aims to find a direction of renewal from the viewpoint of improving the “Ambient Visitor Experience” rather than improving the physical environment by rebuilding and planning the ecological museum. (Method) The comparative analysis of the experience theory of John Dewey, as well as the experience of major researchers such as Bernd H. Schmitt and Douglas Wort were conducted. We redefined the concept of design of ambient experiences, and analyzed the structure of the “Ambient Visitor Experience”. The ecological museum, which is set as the subject space of this study, is an experiential learning space that makes people think about a way of life in which human beings and nature can coexist through the relationship between living creatures and the ecological environment of the ecosystem. In this research, five kinds of expressive elements of ambient experience design have been analyzed and applied to the case analysis of domestic ecological museums, and directionality and a proposal is made for an ambient experience design methodology which should be renewed before exhibitions. (Results) The success factors of the improvement of the exhibition environment are related not to the improvement of the physical environment, the exhibition scale, and the exhibitions of experience but to the ambient experience of the visitors and the relational density of the overall experience factors. That is, the enhancement of the viewer's experience is possible when the exhibition theme, narrative structure, and development. (Conclusions) In the renewal of the ecological museum, exhibitions using environmental experience design model, rather than physical and surface experience, result in creative thinking and the improvement of visitor experience. The model also provides the viewer with a true sense of experience, and creates an atmosphere. This will lead to the joy of discovering new things through the “transformation of thoughts” and meaningful behavior and practice. This study is valuable because it presents practical guidelines for environmental experience design in the renewal process of ecological museums."
문화상호주의적 맥락에서 본 비보잉의 한국적 수용 - <마리오네트> 개별 사례 분석,2017,"['마리오네트', '문화상호주의', '비보잉', '익스프레션 크루', '힙합', 'B-boying', 'Expression Crew', 'Hip hop', 'Interculturalism', 'Marionette']","본고는 익스프레션 크루의 <마리오네트>에 나타난 비보잉의 공연화양상을 문화상호주의적 맥락에서 고찰한다. 문화상호주의 논의는 주로 동서양 상위문화의 소재를 결합한 서양 연출가들의 시도에 대한 긍정적인 평가와 이에 대한 포스트식민주의적 비판의 두 가지 양상을 중심으로 전개되어 왔다. 이런 맥락에서 일반적으로 미국의 하위문화로 간주되는 비보잉을 한국적 맥락에서 재창조하여 큰 호응을 얻은 <마리오네트>사례 분석은 서구와 상위문화 중심의 문화상호주의 담론을 보완하는데 보탬이 될 수 있다. 특히 이 작품이 미국의 개인주의와 쿨(cool)을 중시하는 힙합정신, 그리고 배틀(battle)이라는 경쟁구도에 기반한 비보잉을 한국적인 맥락에서 전문성과 규율, 창의성, 그리고 협동의 예술로 재창조하였다는 점에 주목하고자 한다. 이러한 문화적 수입과 재창조 과정에서 핵심적인 견인차 역할을 한 것은 거창한 이론이나 정치적 의식이 아닌 한국의 사회문화적 환경, 연출가와 배우들의 열정과 예술적 감수성, 그리고 그들이 작품 제작 과정 가운데 겪었던 여러 갈등을 포함하는 복합적인 요소이다. 본고는 이러한 분석을 통해 다음과 같은 두 가지 결론에 도달한다. 첫째, 문화상호주의 공연은 반드시 보편적 인간성의 발견 혹은 식민화-탈식민화와 같은 거대담론적 맥락 속에서 발생하기보다는 각 공연이 지닌 특수한 문화적ㆍ개인적 환경 속에서 자발적으로 이루어질 수 있다. 둘째, 외국문화에 대한 존중과 비판의식을 동시에 가지고 창작된 <마리오네트>는 그것이 지니는 정치적ㆍ예술적 한계에도 불구하고 문화상호주의 공연의 한 긍정적 사례로서 오늘날 세계화 시대에 문화교류를 통해 연극이라는 장르가 형식과 내용면에서 더 다채롭고 풍성한 예술이 될 수 있음을 보여준다.","The essay examines the specific and various factors surrounding Expression Crew`s intercultural adaptation of hip hop and b-boying into the non-verbal b-boying show The Marionette in the contemporary Korean context. The existing discourse of intercultural performance has revolved around western directors` creative attempts to recreate eastern performance traditions in their own cultural context and postcolonial reactions to such `appropriation` of cultures of the Other. What have been relatively overlooked are intercultural performances by non-western artists and those that utilize `low` or sub-cultures. In this respect, The Marionette provides an alternative intercultural model since the Korean b-boys have successfully recreated American b-boying, a subcultural dance genre traced back to the Harlem youths in the late 20th century, into a distinct show of its own despite its aesthetic and political limitations. More specifically, The Marionette has transformed the originally individualist and battle-oriented dance into an art of professionalism and collaboration with a touch of romantic lyricism that strongly appeals to young Korean audiences. At the center of the intercultural adaptation process lie the enthusiasm and individual circumstances of Expression Crew as well as the peculiar socio-cultural environment of South Korea. The case study of The Marionette shows that intercultural performance cannot be reduced to a single factor such as the director`s vision but multiple socio-cultural and individual factors are involved in its creation. More significantly, as a solid model of intercultural performance, The Marionette demonstrates the possibility that, by staying open to other cultures while remaining critical of them at the same time, theatre today can offer distinct, creative, and culturally diverse performance experiences to its audience."

They were not accepted in general poetics, but they became a key to understand on his creation methodology. We can find his psychological motivation in his coinage system. The `dense core` was a cue from tuberculosis, his chronic disease. He thought of `the tuberculosis` as `the consumption of life`, and he regarded `the dense core` as the opposite of it. He imagined that the `dense core` was a fruit of the artistic sublimation. He transformed the image of `dense core` into the other solid image like the small crystal or the jewel. They have relevance to the image of ego. The `translucence` was a cue from the pruritus, his other disease. This idea developed into the imagination of the membrane. It have relevance to the subject of `le moi-peau`. He seek the model of `universe rhyme` in an aurora. It was a havenly version of `le moi-peau`. He imagined the inner rhythm after seeing an aurora in the television. He approached to the secret of existence through exploring the image of his own ego."
컬러tv의 시대와 정동의 정치학-1980년대 박완서의 단편소설을 중심으로,2017,"['Park Wan-seo', 'affect', 'TV', 'media', '1980s', 'the new military authority', 'silence', 'aphasia', 'eloquence']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Two events in 1980 dramatically show the way in which the new military authority governed. If the killings in Gwangju in May 1980 were a tragedy that exposed the violence of the new military authority in the same year, the domestic sale of color TV was allowed in the same year and the launch of color broadcasting promoted political indifference through the spread of consumer culture, and it was a choice to practice the ideological propaganda of the military authority at a micro level. Throughout the 1980s, various media, including color TV, penetrated deep into the daily lives of the public under the media control of the new military authority and secretly practiced the disciplines and controls embedded in the regime. In order to understand the process more precisely, it is the task of this study to adopt a recent research methodology focusing on affect rather than the methodology of culture criticism based on conventional ideological theory and to verify its effectiveness. The theory of affect attempts to explain what kind of political change the affecting and affected body can experience and how its potential is suppressed/liberated.As an introductory discussion to understand how Korean society experienced the 1980s in the perspective of affective layer, this study focuses on Park Wan seo's short story, Silence and Aphasia, published in December 1980. This story shows that the three forms that the language can take in the era of the suppression of truth are the ‘eloquence’, ‘silence’ and ‘aphasia’. ‘Silence’ evokes the suppressed truth, but the ‘eloquence’ by pouring out lies can cause the oblivion of repression, which causes a state of ‘aphasia’, where eventually the language itself is lost. This story sharply points out that ‘silence’ and ‘aphasia’ resemble each other on the surface, but in the deep sense, the ‘eloquence’ has the politics which is not different from ‘aphasia’, which is the excellence of this story that the form of existence of media including contemporary TV in the 1980s is grasped from the perspective of the politics of the ‘eloquence’. Park Wan-seo reveals that it is the nature of the media to make the truth ‘silent’ with a false ‘eloquence’.In this passage we can see the nature of the ‘politics of affect’ that speakers call the “artifice” or “conspiracy” of the media. First, the media transforms the non-homogeneous and non-discursive ‘affect’ into an image of ‘emotion’ and processes it as being easy to govern. This story shows a model of how the media use themselves to categorize dominance power into emotions that can be perceived and controlled by the people.Second, in the hierarchical relationship of power, the ruler suppresses the affect of the subjects, but the affect as the physical force remains and seeks an escapist exit. In this story, the hero's path and its driving force arise not from rational and conscious choice but from the change of the previous conscious body. Thus, this story sees the way in which the politics of affect works through the media in the 1980s, capturing the flow of emancipatory affect of its time, which was not fully captured."
고교 평준화 정책과 특목고 정책의 논증적 고찰: rawls의 정의 실현을 위한 내재적 준거를 중심으로,2017,"['갈등감소', '고교 평준화정책', '교육정의', '교육정의의 원칙', '롤스', '명확성', '모든 개인이익의 증대', '사회적 실용성', '정의의 내재적 준거', '특목고정책']","이 연구는 Rawls가 그리는 정의로운 사회를 구현하는데 필요한 내재적 준거 개념들인 ‘사 회적 실용성’, ‘명확성’, ‘갈등감소’, ‘모든 개인이익의 증대’에 터하여 고교 평준화 정책과 특목 고 정책을 정책논증 구조를 통하여 분석한 후, 정의 관점에서 개선된 교육정책 방향을 제시 하는데 목적이 있다. 이 연구의 결과는 다음과 같다. 첫째, 사회적 실용성 준거의 관점에서, 교육정책은 정의(Justice)를 고려한 교육정책 개념으 로의 변화가 필요하다. 즉 정의를 고려한 교육정책은 교육을 위해 봉사하기 위하여, 국민 전 체의 공익 증가를 가정해야하고, 피해를 보는 개인을 고려하여 ‘사회의 보편적 이익’을 추구 할 수 있는 실용적 수단이어야 한다. 둘째, 명확성 준거의 관점에서, 사회의 정의를 실현하기 위한 기본적인 원칙에 대한 합의가 필요하다. 이러한 합의의 바탕은 고교 평준화와 특목고 정책에서 최소수혜자가 누구인가와 정의를 실현하기 위한 원칙은 무엇인가를 명확하게 하는 것이다. 셋째, 갈등감소 준거의 관점에서, 시대상황에 적용될 수 있는 정의 실현의 이행 구조 와 절차를 명세화할 필요가 있다. 현시점에서 고교 평준화와 특목고 정책은 최소수혜자 관점 에서 모든 학생이 교육적으로 성장할 수 있는 이행 구조와 과정을 명확히 함으로써 갈등을 완화해야한다. 마지막으로, 모든 개인이익 증가를 위하여 고교 평준화와 특목고 정책에서 발 생할 수 있는 문제점을 보완할 수 있는 제도적 대안으로 차등의 원칙이 적용되어야 한다. 이 러한 차등의 원칙 적용은, 자유주의 체제 내에 상기의 정책에서 발생하는 불평등이 있더라도, 이들이 단순한 평등이 주는 수준과 비교해서 모든 사람의 처지를 개선해 줄 수 있을 때, 이 러한 정책적 불평등을 허용해야 한다는 것을 의미한다.","This research is a policy argument study on the realization of educational justice, based on “A Theory of Justice” by John Rawls. The problems with this research are as follows; First, does educational Justice policy implementation increase social educational practicality in viewpoint of socal utility? Second, does accumulation of justifiable education and delivery of justifiable educational products maximize clarity for the least advantaged? Third, does educational Justice policy implementation decrease social conflicts? fourth, does educational Justice policy implementation increase all persons’ benefit in a society, rather than maximization of average person’s benefit? In capitulate briefly, this article has attempted to sketch out the some considerations of educational justice policy implementation process and the layout of justice policy choice model under the viewpoint of ‘High School Equalization Policy’ and ‘Special Purpose High School Policy’. First, educational policy definition for utilitarianism should transform into educational policy definition for considering social practicality in realization of justice. Second, people’s clear agreement of rules for educational justice policy implementation is essential to succeed in the policy. Third, educational justice policy implementation should consider securing proofs and requiring proper ways for realization of justice for decreasing social conflicts. Fourth, Rawls’s difference principle should be applied for everyone’s advantage. Finally, research implications and the layout of justice policy implementation model are suggested."
유가 사상과 신화적 사유의 상호 관계성 연구 ― 성인 관념을 중심으로 ―,2017,"['유가', '신화', '상호관계성', '성인', '무사(巫師)', 'Confucianism', 'Mythology', 'Interconnectivity', 'Sagehood', 'Wushi']","본 연구는 유가 사상이 신화적 사유와의 상호 관계성 속에서 어떻게 발전되어 왔는지를 고찰한다. 특히 원시 사유체계 및 신화적 사고와 연관성에 주목하여 유가의 이상적 인격체인 성인의 형성도 그 원류가 신화적사유와 상호 관계성을 갖고 있다고 보았다. 이를 위해 신화적 사유 속에서의 성의 의미를 검토하고, 이것이 유가의 성인으로 전환되는 의미 변화를 검토하였다. 고대 인류에서 부족장은 신들과 교류하여 종교적으로는 인간과 신들을 매개하여 신들의 말씀을 인간에게 전함과 동시에 인간의 염원도 신에게 전달하는 이중적이며 중간자적인 역할을 수행한다. 신을 대신하여 정치와 종교, 교육을 총 망라하여 수행하는 제정일치의 통치자는 점차 종교와 현세적 정치권력이 이원화되는데, 현세적 권능 대신 도덕적 정당성을 통한 권위를 부여받은 새로운 인격체가 유가의 성인이다. 유가에서는 공자에서부터 맹자, 순자에 이르기까지 현세에서 이룰 수 없는 높은 수준의 이상적 도덕군자에서 시작하여 누구나 노력에 의해 다다를 수 있는 가장 모범적이고 이상적인 인간상으로까지 규정한다. 따라서 초기 유가의 성인 개념은 상대적으로 신화적 성인의 이상적인 권위에 주안점을 두어 인간이 다다를 수 없는 초절대적인 완성된 인간으로 상정되었다면, 이후의 유가에서는 점차 도덕적인 수양을 통해 누구나 다다를 수 있는 존재로 상정된다. 한편 문명을 전수하고 인간을 계도하는 역할은 완전히 사라진 것이 아니라 다시 현세의 권위와 결합하여 도덕적 성인의 권위까지 부여한 새로운 존재자로 재탄생한다. 이상과 같이 이상적인 인간상으로서의 성인이라는 매개를 통해 유가 사상과 신화적 사유가 상호 관계성 속에서 형성되고 발전되어 왔음을 확인할 수 있다.","This study examines the ways in which Confucianism developed in connection with other thoughts. Mythology especially had an great impact on the formation of Confucian thoughts. This study focuses on the concept of sage and examines how Confucianism and mythological thoughts influenced on formation and reformation of the concepts. In ancient religion, sages as a hierophantic figure, mediates human beings and gods, delivering the gods` messages to the human and the human`s wishes to the gods. The fused role of shaman and ruler began to separate. A new type of leader without political power, but with a religious role with a moral authority is the Confucian concept of sage. A sage in Confucianism is an ideal person like Confucius, Mencius, and Xunzi, an ordinary person can attain with effort. Anyone can become a sage in Confucianism. The early Confucian sage was more like a hyper-human with unaccessible authority in mythology. Later, a sage in Confucianism began to be described as a model figure that any human being can become. The aspect of shamans and diviners (wushi 巫師) did not disappear, but merged into a kingly power and transformed into a sage-king with moral authority. The new images are reflected in Confucian ideology of statehood or its religiosity. This study has explored the ways in which Confucianism and mythological thoughts interacted and influenced to each other through a concept of sage as an ideal personhood."
安義縣監 朴趾源이 보여준 북학의 실천과 治績 - 연민 선생의 북학에 관한 연구와 연관선상에서 -,2017,"['안의현감', '혜경궁홍씨', '하풍죽로당', '연상각', '백척오동각', '공작관', 'Anyi county magistrate', 'Hyegyŏnggung Hong Ssi', 'Hap’ungchukno dang', 'Paekch’ŏkodong kak', 'Kongjak guan', 'yangsŏn', 'gikki', 'yongkol', '颺扇', '龍骨', '龍眉']","본고는 연민 선생의 북학에 대한 연구를 살펴보고, 나아가 연암 박지원의 安義 현감 시절에 주목하여 그의 치적과 작품 활동을 북학의 실현이라는 관점에서 살펴보기 위하여 작성되었다. 연암이 북경과 열하를 다녀오고 나서 강조한 북학 사상은 안의 현감으로 와서 구체적인 건축물이나 樓臺의 명칭, 농기구 같은 것에서 나타난다. 하풍죽로당과 백척오동각, 공작관 같은 건축물이나 연상각 같은 현판의 당호로 표현된 것이 있었고, 颺扇과 織機, 龍骨, 龍眉, 水轉, 輪碾 같은 농기구도 있었다. 북학과 관련된 행동은 안의현감 시절에 집중적으로 나타난 현상으로 박지원이 면천군수와 양양부사로 있으면서 보여준 행적과는 매우 다른 모습이다. 그리고 이 시기 연암은 『열하일기』 같이 자유분방한 글쓰기 방식에서 벗어나 공문서 같은 실용문에 치력하던 때이기도 하다. 정조는 연암의 글쓰기에 관심을 가지고 있었다. 이덕무와 박제가 등이 지은 『武藝圖譜通志』와 이덕무가 지은 『御倭諸論』을 보고 연암의 문체와 같다고 지적하였다. 이어 정조는 남공철을 통해 연암에게 순정한 글을 바치라는 명령을 한다. 정조의 지적에는 천주교에 빠져있던 남인들이 벽파의 공격을 받게 되자 정조는 남인들이 천주교에 빠진 것을 지적하는 동시에 노론의 문체를 지적하여 당파의 균형을 취하려고 했다는 정치적인 배경도 있었다. 이를 계기로 현감으로 있던 연암은 그동안 『열하일기』 같은 편에서 『장자』를 인용하거나 백화체를 사용했던 방식에서 벗어나 점자 주자의 서간문이나 陸宣公의 奏議 같은 글을 탐독하여 문체도 일신하게 된다. 정조가 연암의 문체를 문제 삼고 난 후 연암은 그동안 지은 자신의 저술을 정리하여 「연상각선본」과 「공작관문고」라는 책의 卷으로 정리하여 국왕에게 받치려고 했다. 결국 이 편명은 훗날 『연암집』이 편찬될 때 1권, 2권, 3권이 된다. 안의현감 시절 단편의 글은 40여 편에 이르고 면천군수 시절에는 10여 편에 이른다. 그리고 1년도 채 못 되는 양양부사 이후의 시절에는 겨우 몇 편에 그쳤으니 사실상 작품생활은 거의 하지 않았다고 할 수 있다. 안의현감시절의 글 중에는 감사의 부름을 받고 獄事에 관하여 전말을 기록한 글이 있으며, 안의현의 현안 문제를 다룬 글로 함양군수와 주변인들에게 준 편지가 있다. 그리고 안의현 관사의 주변을 정돈하고 각종 건축물의 記文을 남기고 있다. 아전들이 받드는 郭侯에 대한 記文도 남기고 있어 안의현감 시절 연암 저술 활동을 살필 수 있다. 연암이 안의현감으로 있으면서 남긴 행적은 실학의 실천이라는 시각에서 살펴보았다. 함양에 홍수의 피해가 발생하자 안의현감으로서 사람을 동원하여 효율적으로 일을 처리한 과정, 공덕비를 마다하는 청렴, 해학이 있는 좋아는 매력 같은 것을 살펴보았다. 특히 안의현에 보관되었던 저치곡 9,000석을 확보하고 호조에 보내어 심이지가 혜경궁 홍씨를 위한 잔치에 사용할 수 있게 도운 것은 연암의 중요한 행적 중의 하나이다. 안의현감시절 연암을 살펴본다는 것은 그의 전체 작품생활을 이해하는데 의의가 있다고 본다. 그가 『열하일기』와 같이 호방하고 자유로운 글쓰기 방식에서 실용문 위주의 글을 쓰기 시작한 것이 바로 안의현감시절이기 때문이다. 그리고 이 시기에 정조는 연암의 문체를 거론하였고, 함양군수 윤광석은 연암이 오랑케 풍속을 따라하고 있다고 비난하였다. 연암은 안의현감을 거치면서 내외적으로 자신이 구현하려고 한 북학사상이 현실적인 난관에 봉착했던 것으로 보인다. 그가 정조에게 순정한 글을 지어 바친 것은 안의현감 시절부터 시작하여 면천 군수 시절에 와서 완성된 것으로 보인다. 면천 군수 시절 「課農小抄」, 「서이방익사」, 「沔陽雜錄」 같은 편이 완성되었지만, 이중 「과농소초」와 「면양잡록」은 이미 안의현감 시절부터 구상된 작품이라고 볼 수 있다. 안의현감 시절의 연암은 글쓰기 방식으로서의 문체와 필생의 역점사업이었던 북학이 쟁점으로 떠올랐던 시절이었다. 안의현감 시절을 독립시켜 살펴본다는 것은 이런 변화의 추이를 좀 더 깊이 있게 들여다 볼 수 있을 것이다. 또한 연암 작품의 창작연대와 배경을 함께 살펴볼 수 있다는 점은 시공간의 영향을 받는 연암을 이해할 수 있다는 점에서 의의가 있다고 할 것이다.","The purpose of this paper is not only to examine I Kawŏn’ Northern Learning (Pukhak, 北學) but also to evaluate Pak Chi-won’s works related with his experience in envoy to Qing (Yŏnhaeng 燕行) an official trip that made Pak Chi-won to emphasize Northern Learning. The experience in Qing le Pak to transform his thought and it was represented in his nomenclature of architectures and farming tools, e. g. Hap’ungchukno dang 荷風竹露堂, Paekch’ŏkodong kak 百尺梧桐閣, Kongjak guan 孔雀館 for architectures, and yangsŏn 颺扇, gikki 織機, and yongkol 龍骨 for farming tools. His experience of Anyi county magistrate (Anyi hyŏn’gam 安義縣監) is significant in that most of his activities were deeply rooted in Northern Learning comparing with his other government services, such as Yŏnch’ŏn magistrate (Yŏnch’ŏn kunsu 沔川郡守) and Yangyang governor (Yangyang busu 襄陽副守). During his government service in Anyi, Pak Chi-won devoted his times and efforts to horning his practical writings skills, thus trying to escape from his ordinary, wild literary style-so-called “Yonam’s literary style (yonamch’e 燕巖體).” Diary of Yorha (Yŏrha ilgi 熱河日記), a representative work of Pak‘s, were full of yonamch’e and other intellectuals, I Dŏkmu and Yu Tŭkgong, paid their attention to the unique literary style. King of Chŏng was also interested in yonamch’e. He, however, criticized Pak’s literary style, pushing him to write in different way; in other words, he commanded Pak to write an official document with simple structures and traditional word usages. King of Chŏng’s condemnation on literary style was related with his political purpose to keep a balance between power of Southerners (Namin 南人) and power of Westerners (Sŏin 西人). For this reason, Pak Chi-won pored over epistolary literature (sŏganmun 書簡文) or model essays for official document and to reform his literary style; given the fact that his former literary work, Diary of Yorha, ofen cited the lines of Zhuangzi 莊子 and employed modern chines style (paekhuach’e 白話體), this change generated a big difference. The change of his literary style was reflected on Yŏnsangkak sŏnbon 煙湘閣選本 and Kongjakguan mungo 孔雀館文稿 which were released during his periods of Yŏnan county magistrate. His writings in that periods, illuminates his diverse activities; he wrote relatively many essays in Yŏnan compared to other government service periods. Specifically, most of his activities were related with Silhak 實學. The most conspicuous record of Pak is that he acquired the surplus grains stored in Anyi county and sent them to Ministry of Taxation (Hojo 戶曹), thus helping to utilize the redundant grain for Hyegyŏnggung Hong Ssi. To sum up, his activities as Yŏnan county magistrate provide meaningful, various evidences to grasp his writings in Yŏnan county; given the fact that he wrote more writings- not with formal, pragmatic style but with wild, unconstrained style, in Yŏnan county than in other places, his periods of Yŏnan county magistrate is important. In this respects, this paper gives better understanding not only on the change of his writings but also the transformation of his thoughts."
marketing a luxury brand through digital storytelling: an analysis of campaign diffusion through youtube and instagram,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"As a contemporary, postmodern marketing strategy, digital storytelling is the virtual means by which a story can be organized. Less traditional than a conventional beginning, middle, and end narrative, the genre suggests that individuals connect the dots of a story by comparing their reading with others. This research examines Christian Dior’s Secret Garden IV campaign film as it is broadcasted on YouTube for six weeks and diffused through Instagram. Through a grounded theory approach we measure and analyze audience engagement and key themes expressed through user-generated content on YouTube and Instagram. Manual coding and three computer-aided text analysis programs are used to analyze the data and triangulate results. This research contributes to the literature on consumer engagement in digital storytelling, online brand communities, and celebrity endorsement.IntroductionDigital technologies have improved the aesthetics of content creation, enabling brands to develop deeper levels of engagement with consumers through social channels (Merrilees, 2016). Every day hundreds of millions of hours of video are consumed on YouTube and the number of high performing channels has been increasing by 50% per year (YouTube, 2017). Instagram’s monthly active users have grown from 300 million in December 2014 to 600 million in December 2016 (Statista, 2017). Within the social media sphere, commercial and individual users connect through multiple platforms and devices to share ideas and information without the constraint of time and space (Gruzd & Wellman, 2014). The digitization of visual culture provides users with so much content that it may even result in information overload (Babin et al., 2017). This research focuses on the fashion sector and social media platforms that cater specifically to visual imagery and video content. The logic is twofold: the fashion industry is inherently visual and research on a study of eighty-three fashion brands indicates a shift from traditional advertising to video products, especially on social media (L2 Inc., 2016).We examine elements of French luxury goods company, Christian Dior’s Secret Garden omni-channel marketing campaign. As a collection of short films shown on YouTube and in other media, the campaign had four annual installments beginning in 2012. The Secret Garden series explores the brand’s past and present within the context of the 21st century Palace of Versailles. Our focus is on Secret Garden IV, launched in May 2015, featuring singer/songwriter Rihanna as the protagonist. Dior’s portrayal of Versailles throughout the Secret Garden series reflects undertones of its monarchial heritage and its high fashion prestige. In Secret Garden IV, there is a juxtaposition to this theme when Rihanna’s subculture persona and celebrity status (Fleetwood, 2012) presents a misalignment between luxury ideals and Rihanna’s position in popular culture. Table 1 provides an overview of the history of the campaign.This research measures and analyzes audience engagement and key themes expressed through users’ comments on YouTube and Instagram for the pre-launch and launch of the Secret Garden IV campaign. Through a grounded theory approach we identify, analyze, and validate keywords and group them into themes utilizing both manual coding and computer-aided text analysis (Lai & To, 2015). We utilize three software programs (Tableau, NVivo 11, and Leximancer) to triangulate results. The scholarly literature on fashion luxury goods is scant and this methodological approach is sound (Neuendorf, 2017).Five recent scholarly articles on luxury fashion goods and social media were identified. One relates to storytelling and is visually-focused (Megehee & Spake, 2012); three develop models (Kim & Ko, 2010; Kim & Ko, 2012; Brogi et al., 2013); and one uses the case study approach (Phan et al., 2011). This research fills both a theoretical and a methodological gap. We examine a digital storytelling campaign across social media platforms with the prospect of new theoretical insights. According to Snelson (2016) there is scant social media research on YouTube and Instagram and social media research using a grounded theory approach is also limited.Theoretical backgroundDigital StorytellingDigital storytelling uses technology as an extension of oral and written stories “…to solidify our cultures and share knowledge for the future” (Irwin, 2014, p. 40), placing engagement with digital media as an extension of the self. People naturally think in narratives and stories, rather than arguments and paradigms (Megehee & Spake, 2012) and may use digital storytelling to order otherwise disconnected experiences into interrelated, meaningful episodes (Vannini, 2012). By connecting the dots of a story on social media users have the opportunity to formulate meanings of their own and build interpretations by comparing their “reading” with that of others. Social media has empowered the consumer by enabling communication that is multi-way, multi-directional, and led by the consumer (Tuten & Solomon, 2015).The fashion film on the internet has been viewed as “a genre that is not is not simply a tool to stimulate consumption, but is something that is set to change our notion of fashion as a moment in time” (Khan, 2012, p. 236). In her review, “100 Years of the Fashion Film,” Marketa Uhlirova posits that contemporary technologies aimed at a film’s “potential to promote fashion” turned into “the medium’s ability to recast consumption as seductive visual entertainment,” devaluing a fashion film’s potential for not only entertainment and visual pleasure, but also for experimentation and innovation (Uhlirova, 2013, p. 140; p. 153).Online Brand CommunitiesAs a hub of value creation in the consumer marketplace, brand communities are an enthusiastic, passionate group of customers who express similar commitment towards a brand or product and may not be geographically bound (Muniz Jr. & O’Guinn, 2001; McAlexander et al., 2002). In brand communities created by marketers, organizations may stimulate engagement, brand loyalty and the expression of positive emotions and trust (Bagozzi & Dholakia, 2006; Jung et al., 2014).Customer engagement behaviour pertains to a variety of online and offline behaviours (e.g. word of mouth, blogging, customer reviews) that are not transactional, but can be measured (Verhoef et al., 2010). Although positive word of mouth and brand advocacy are not guaranteed, an organization’s most engaged social customers have the potential to communicate messages that are perceived as more credible than those generated by the organization (Kozinets et al., 2010). A high level of engagement may be described as delight or joy. Engagement requires strong emotional and relational bonds (commitment and trust), and may transform customers into loyal “fans” or co-creators of value (Hawkins & Davis, 2012). A study of customer engagement behaviour in a social media environment is complex because engagement behaviour in different channels may vary considerably, with a different effect on value creation or purchase intent. For example, if a customer tweets on a mobile device his/her engagement and purchase intent may differ from engagement and purchase intent as a result of interaction with a video or blog (Libai et al., 2010).Celebrity EndorsementA celebrity endorsement is defined as “an agreement between an individual who enjoys public recognition (a celebrity) and an entity (e.g., a brand) to use the celebrity for the purpose of promoting the entity” (Bergkvist & Zhou, 2016). Celebrity endorsements previously were associated primarily with consumer goods and services advertised through traditional media, such as print and television. More recently, these endorsements encompass any mode of communication as well as business-to-business goods and services. This update is significant considering the addition of advertising on the Internet, in social media, “stealth marketing” on TV talk shows (Kaikati & Kaikati, 2004) and red carpet appearances (Carroll, 2009).Theories related to celebrity persuasion that have application to the fashion industry have examined the way consumers process information from marketing communications and relate it to their self-concept (Carroll, 2009). To the consumer, the celebrity represents a meaning, based on the recognition s/he has received in the symbolic environment and his/her persona. This meaning is transferred to the product when the celebrity is seen in the marketing communication. In the final stage, the meaning moves from the product to the consumer, who transfers the meaning into his/her notion of the self-concept (Carroll, 2009). This transference effect benefits the brand (Tuten & Solomon, 2015) and the consumer who may use products to reveal their self-concept to others (Babin, et al., 2017), especially in high involvement consumption situations (Ahuvia, 2005).MethodSampleInstagram and YouTube data were collected using Netlytic (Gruzd, 2016) for the period May 14 – June 24, 2015 for the purpose of capturing data before and after the official release of the film (May 18, 2015). A total of 8,986 records (uncleansed) are in the Instagram (#SecretGarden4 and @Dior) database and 426 records (uncleansed) in the YouTube database. Multiple URLs were used for YouTube because there were four previews, and short and long versions of the film.ProceduresThe data was cleansed (236 YouTube posts; 6,763 Instagram posts). To measure sentiment and engagement, a text analysis was performed using an adaptation of Dann’s Twitter (2010) classification. Through a grounded theory approach (Lai & To, 2015) key words, concepts and themes were identified and triangulated using Tableau, NVivo 11, and Leximancer software programs.Concluding RemarksAs a multi-year campaign, Dior’s Secret Garden was meticulously crafted to project an understanding of Dior’s brand image and to create an air of anticipation for consumers. Within the context of digital storytelling we delve deeply into how the last installment of this campaign resonated with consumers who watched the film on social media and responded to Dior’s Instagram initiatives. Through our mixed methods research approach, we develop theoretical and methodological contributions that benefit academics and fashion marketers."
의성 진민사의 역사문화적 가치와 의례적 성격,2017,"['의성', '사우', '향교', '서원', '향사', '문중', 'Uiseong', 'shrine', 'confucian school', 'lecture hall', 'squire', 'family']","이 논문은 의성김씨 문중 사우인 오토산 진민사鎭民祠의 역사문화적 가치와 의례적 성격을 조명하려는 목적에서 작성되었다.진민사는 의성군 사곡면 토현리 오토산五土山에 자리하고 있으며, 제향인물은 의성김씨 중시조 김용비金龍庇이다. 그는 고려 명종 때 의성지역에 거주하면서 민란을 평정한 공적을 세워 지역민들의 추앙을 받았으며, 진민사는 그 공적을 기리기 위해 건립된 사당이다. 이처럼 당시 김용비가 세운 공적은 지역공동체를 넘어 국가의 위기를 구한 것이기 때문에 그를 위한 추모공간인 진민사 역시 지역성에 기반한 공묘公廟로서의 성격을 지니고 있었다. 이러한 사실은 진민사가 의성읍내 관아 근처에 세워졌다는 점을 통해서도 입증된다.이후 진민사는 퇴락과 화재 등으로 수차례에 걸친 중수와 이건 등을 거듭하다가 1868년 서원철폐령으로 인해 읍내에 자리하고 있던 사당이 헐리면서 지금의 오토산으로 옮겨간다. 이때부터 오토산은 단순한 자연경관을 넘어 의성김씨의 상징적 제의공간으로 자리잡게 된다. 그런데 이 과정에서 진민사의 주도권은 지역사회로부터 의성김씨 문중으로 점차 넘어오게 되는데, 그 기점은 성리학적 가문의식이 형성되기 시작하는 16세기 무렵이다. 즉, 문중의식의 강화로 인해 후손들은 혈통적 근원에 대해 관심을 갖게 되고 이는 결국 진민사에 대한 주도권을 행사하려는 결과로 이어졌던 것이다. 이에 반해 의성읍민들 역시 진민사를 공공의 지역유산이 아니라 혈통적 차원에서 인식하게 됨으로써 결국에는 특정 성씨의 사묘私廟로 간주하게 된다.그런데 진민사의 제향인물인 김용비는 의성지역 출신으로, 지역민들을 위해 목숨을 아끼지 않고 난적亂賊을 물리치는 공적을 세웠으며, 또 지역에 뼈를 묻었다. 이는 특정 혈통을 넘어 모든 후대인들의 귀감龜鑑이 될 만한 행적이며 우리 모두가 추구해야할 보편적 가치이기도 하다. 이런 점에서 진민사, 나아가 진민사가 자리한 오토산은 단순히 특정 혈통의 뿌리가 깃든 장소가 아니라 현대를 살아가는 우리들이 본받을만한 정신문화를 간직한 공간으로서의 가치와 의미를 지니고 있는 셈이다. 그리고 이것이야말로 진민사가 특정 가문과 혈통을 넘어 지역의 문화유산으로 거듭나야할 이유라고 할 수 있다.","The purpose of this paper was to review historical cultural value and Ritual Character of Jinminsa Shrine of Oto Mountain, which is a family shrine of Uiseong Kim Family.Jinminsa Shrine is located on Oto Mountain in Tohyeon-ri, Sagok-myeon, Uiseong-gun. The enshrined person is Yongbi Kim, the second progenitor of Uiseong Kim Family. During the reign of King Myeongjong, he lived in Uiseong and was held in high esteem by residents for successfully suppressing a riot. Jinminsa Shrine is a shrine constructed to admire his achievement. Since the achievement of Yongbi Kim at the time saved the entire nation from crisis beyond regional community, Jinminsa Shrine was considered as an elite shrine based on regionality. This is also shown by the fact that Jinminsa Shrine was built nearby the government office of Uiseong-eup.Jinminsa Shrine was repeatedly repaired and rebuilt because of ruining and fire. After the demolition of Jinminsa Shrine in Uiseong-eup with the lecture hall demolition order in 1868, it was rebuilt on Oto Mountain. Ever since this time, Oto Mountain became a symbolic place for Uiseong Kim Family beyond simple natural landscape. During this process, the hegemony of Jinminsa Shrine was gradually shifted form the community to Uiseong Kim Family. This shift started in the 16th century when the neo-Confucian family consciousness began to settle in. In other words, with the increase of family consciousness, descendents paid greater attention to the origin of the family and showed efforts to gain the hegemony of Jinminsa Shrine. On the other than, residents of Uiseong-eup also started to recognize Jinminsa Shrine as a private shrine of a specific family without regionality.However, Yongbi Kim the person enshrined at Jinminsa Shrine lived in Uiseong, risked his life to protect residents by defeating rioters, and died in this place. His deeds present a role model to future generations and a universal value to be pursued by all, not limited to a specific family.

Various financial variables have been tested for stock return predictability, but the results remain inconclusive. In the Korean stock market, Kim and Kim (2004), Kim and Park (2009) and Chung and Kim (2010) try to find evidence of return predictability using the dividend-price ratio, earnings-price ratio, and interest rates, but their conclusions are mixed. More recently, Choi et al. (2016) propose a robust test of stock return predictability which combines the time-change method with a Cauchy estimator. They show that the random time Cauchy test has an exact size of test and comparable power to Campbell and Yogo (2006) and Chen and Deo (2009)`s tests. We apply this new methodology to the KOSPI index and report the empirical results, providing comparison with other widely used tests for return predictability. Stock returns have nearly nonstationary stochastic volatility, and this causes substantial size distortions on standard tests relying on constant variance. To handle this nonstationary stochastic volatility in returns, we implement a simple time change. For the required time change, “we wait for volatility to reach a certain threshold before collecting each observation such that there is a constant level of volatility across all observations in our sample.”(Campbell and Yogo, 2006) Using the daily KOSPI index, we first test the presence of discrete jumps in our sample. We detect a total of 15 jumps between January 2001 and December 2014 with the windows size 16 and a 5% significance level, using Lee and Mykland (2008) test. Depending on the presence of discrete jumps, we measure the realized variance and realized bi-power variation. When we allow for only the continuous martingale in the regression error, we remove the detected daily jumps and compute the total realized variance by squaring and summing up daily excess returns. When we allow our continuous time regression model to have discrete jumps, we compute the realized total bi-power variation without removing detected jumps. We have a total of 168 months in our sample span. The computed total realized variance (TQV) and total realized bi-power variation (TBPV) are then divided by the number of months and we set this as our volatility threshold △<sub>QV</sub> and △<sub>BPV</sub> for a time change with QV and a time change with BPV, respectively. Using the given volatility threshold, we add up daily squared excess returns until it hits our set △ and resample our regression variables on that date and repeat the process until we reach the TQV and TBPV. After correcting for stochastic volatility in returns, we implement a Cauchy estimator to handle the persistent endogeneity of covariates. The Cauchy estimator uses the sign transform of a covariate as an instrumental variable. “The advantage of using a Cauchy estimator is that the asymptotic normality of the Cauchy t-ratio holds regardless of any statistical anomalies in covariates including nonstationarity, fat-tailed innovations, structural breaks, and jumps.” (Choi et al., 2016) Thus, it is well suited for testing return predictability in cases where many commonly used covariates are highly persistent and correlated with the regression residuals. Inferences using the Cauchy t-ratio are also valid even in the presence of structural breaks and jumps. We test for stock return predictability in the Korean market using the log of dividend-price ratio, the log of earnings-price ratio, the riskfree rate, and short-term, medium-term and long-term yield gaps. For the dividend-price ratio, conventional OLS t-test over-rejects the null hypothesis of no predictability. We could not find evidence for predictability using other tests except the random time Cauchy with BPV. For the earnings- price ratio, none of our tests reject the null. The coefficients of risk-free rates are insignificant except for Campbell and Yogo (2006)`s BQ test where its 90% confidence interval does not include zero value. Using the Amihud and Hurvich (2004) and Campbell and Yogo (2006)`s test, shortterm yield gap has predictive power. But using the Chen and Deo (2009)`s chi-square 1 and random time Cauchy t-test, we could not reject the null. After correcting for persistent endogeneity in the medium-term yield gap, evidence for return predictability disappears, and all our tests except for OLS t-test cannot reject the null. Finally, we could not find any evidence for predictability using the long-term yield gap."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the regenerative mechanisms utilized by implanted SVF cells. Using an in vitro co-culture system, we sought to determine whether SVF implantation into impaired tissue affects endogenous mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation; MSCs can differentiate into a variety of cell types, and they have a strong regenerative capacity despite their low numbers in impaired tissue. Methods: Adipose-derived SVF cells obtained from four donors were co-cultured with bone marrow-derived MSCs, and the differential expression of osteogenic markers and osteogenic differentiation inducers over time was analyzed in mono-cultured MSCs and MSCs co-cultured with SVF cells. Results: The co-cultivation of MSCs with SVF cells significantly and mutually induced the expression of osteogenic-specific markers via paracrine and/or autocrine regulation but did not induce adipocyte, chondrocyte or myoblast marker expression. More surprisingly, subsequent osteogenesis and/or comparable effects were rapidly induced within 48 h. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which osteogenesis and/or comparable effects were rapidly induced in bone marrow-derived MSCs and adipose-derived SVF cells through co-cultivation. Our findings suggest that the positive effects of SVF implantation into impaired bone may be attributed to the rapid induction of MSC osteogenesis, and the transplantation of co-cultured and preconditioned SVF cells and/or MSCs may be more effective than the transplantation of untreated cells for the treatment of bone defects.

I particularly focus on the urban studies and transnational perspectives of the West.  Migration, as a geographical phenomenon, contains categories of space as its property in its own right. In the classical discussion of migration, though, the issue of space was limited to explaining the way in which immigrants’ residences were formed in accordance with their assimilation to the host society. In the basis of those discussions, there were not only the assimilation theory but also the conception of space and place as merely physical containers of human practices and events and which were out there already formed.  With the drastic global transformations which started from around the end of 1980s, the urban studies scholars and those of postmodernism tried to draw the concept of space as being produced through human practices and social relationships in explaining the complex development of modern migration. In particular, transnational approaches combined with geographical concepts such as ‘locality’ and ‘scale’ drawn from the urban studies take notes on the relations among the localities connected through migrants and the dynamics in which localities have transformed and been transformed by global restructuring. Some scholars with such approaches call attention to the migrants’ agency as one of the driving forces of constructing spaces by looking at daily lives and everyday culture in the globalizing processes.  With the remaining ambiguities in various spacial concepts, the discourse of space is still useful to clarify the particularities of immigrant localities and the immigrants’ agency that takes part in constructing those particularities."

Results show that the delay produced by the digital control is the root cause of this effect. An improved voltage feedforward strategy, in which a bandpass filter (BPF) is introduced into the feedforward path, is proposed to strengthen the converter’s robust stability against grid impedance variations. The selection method of the BPF’s bandwidth is also provided considering the tradeoff between the response speed to the grid voltage sag and the system’s robust stability. The converter can work stably over a wide range of the grid impedance through the proposed approach.

The strain response envelope is defined as an image in strain increment space corresponding to the unit stress input in stress space. Based on the shape of strain response envelopes, the deformation characteristics of soils can be described using the framework of elastic-plastic theory. Fourier descriptor analysis was used to investigate the morphological characteristics of strain response envelopes. The numerical results show that when the stress input remains in the initial yield surface the Fourier descriptors remain constant. Once the stress input crosses the initial yield surface, every descriptors deals in this study change.

Methods: This study used Walker and Avant’ process of concept analysis. Results: The conceptual attribute of the lust of type 8 enneagram appeared as 'natural leaders', 'followers of power', 'Enigma Energizer', 'those who refuse to face self' and 'acknowledge true nature'. And the leading factors were 'logic of power', 'refusal to be controlled', 'want to control the environment', and negative result of lust was 'violent destroyer'. Also, the mature result of positive consciousness change appeared as 'generous leader' and 'gentle leader'. Conclusion: The lust that is passion of the type 8 is that a typical lust is strong desire for real power, but in a broad sense lust is a desire to possess and control others, that is a desire to have 'total power' to others like gods. When they understand and become aware of their passion, their passion, they will no longer seek to possess others, and will no longer try to control them. And they will realize self-growth that is transformed into a generous person."

In this article, while agreeing with the idea of implementing a bicameral system that would bring about the greater level of deliberation, representation, and decentralization, the author opposes forming the upper house through an election. Korea’s political behavior in retrospect warns that the same party domination for both houses would do serious harm to the principle of check and balance, while different party control for each house would lead to a protracted political stalemate, causing inefficiency in government.  In this context, this research evaluates the potential of randomly-selected citizen assembly composed of local representatives as a means to overcome such shortcomings of election and to maximize the utility of the bicameral system. The plan is first to transform the pre-existing grassroots community self-help committee into a randomly-selected citizen assembly, then to have another round of random selection of grassroots citizen assembly to form a district-level assembly and to continue this process until the formation of the provincial citizen assembly. By constituting one of two houses as a randomly-selected citizen assembly within the bicameral system, one is likely to complement current representative democracy and achieve institutionalization of public voices vibrantly expressed through the massive candlelight vigils. Amongst all, a citizen assembly with a random selection of its members would provide opportunities for lay people to reinstate their constitutional rights of freedom and equality not only in the traditional realm of politics but also in their everyday lives."

Through the economic crises, bankruptcy have increased and bankruptcy prediction models have become more and more important. Therefore, corporate bankruptcy has been regarded as one of the major topics of research in business management. Also, many studies in the industry are in progress and important.  Previous studies attempted to utilize various methodologies to improve the bankruptcy prediction accuracy and to resolve the overfitting problem, such as Multivariate Discriminant Analysis (MDA), Generalized Linear Model (GLM). These methods are based on statistics. Recently, researchers have used machine learning methodologies such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Furthermore, fuzzy theory and genetic algorithms were used. Because of this change, many of bankruptcy models are developed. Also, performance has been improved.  In general, the company’s financial and accounting information will change over time. Likewise, the market situation also changes, so there are many difficulties in predicting bankruptcy only with information at a certain point in time. However, even though traditional research has problems that don’t take into account the time effect, dynamic model has not been studied much. When we ignore the time effect, we get the biased results. So the static model may not be suitable for predicting bankruptcy. Thus, using the dynamic model, there is a possibility that bankruptcy prediction model is improved.  In this paper, we propose RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) which is one of the deep learning methodologies. The RNN learns time series data and the performance is known to be good. Prior to experiment, we selected non-financial firms listed on the KOSPI, KOSDAQ and KONEX markets from 2010 to 2016 for the estimation of the bankruptcy prediction model and the comparison of forecasting performance. In order to prevent a mistake of predicting bankruptcy by using the financial information already reflected in the deterioration of the financial condition of the company, the financial information was collected with a lag of two years, and the default period was defined from January to December of the year. Then we defined the bankruptcy. The bankruptcy we defined is the abolition of the listing due to sluggish earnings. We confirmed abolition of the list at KIND that is corporate stock information website. Then we selected variables at previous papers. The first set of variables are Z-score variables. These variables have become traditional variables in predicting bankruptcy. The second set of variables are dynamic variable set. Finally we selected 240 normal companies and 226 bankrupt companies at the first variable set. Likewise, we selected 229 normal companies and 226 bankrupt companies at the second variable set.  We created a model that reflects dynamic changes in time-series financial data and by comparing the suggested model with the analysis of existing bankruptcy predictive models, we found that the suggested model could help to improve the accuracy of bankruptcy predictions. We used financial data in KIS Value (Financial database) and selected Multivariate Discriminant Analysis (MDA), Generalized Linear Model called logistic regression (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model as benchmark.   The result of the experiment proved that RNN’s performance was better than comparative model. The accuracy of RNN was high in both sets of variables and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) value was also high. Also when we saw the hit-ratio table, the ratio of RNNs that predicted a poor company to be bankrupt was higher than that of other comparative models. However the limitation of this paper is that an overfitting problem occurs during RNN learning. But we expect to be able to solve the overfitting problem by selecting more lear"

a novel discriminative feature extraction for acoustic scene classification using rnn based source separation,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Various types of classifiers and feature extraction methods for acoustic scene classification have been recently proposed in the IEEE Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2016 Challenge Task 1. The results of the final evaluation, however, have shown that even top 10 ranked teams, showed extremely low accuracy performance in particular class pairs with similar sounds. Due to such sound classes being difficult to distinguish even by human ears, the conventional deep learning based feature extraction methods, as used by most DCASE participating teams, are considered facing performance limitations. To address the low performance problem in similar class pair cases, this letter proposes to employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) based source separation for each class prior to the classification step. Based on the fact that the system can effectively extract trained sound components using the RNN structure, the mid-layer of the RNN can be considered to capture discriminative information of the trained class. Therefore, this letter proposes to use this mid-layer information as novel discriminative features. The proposed feature shows an average classification rate improvement of 2.3% compared to the conventional method, which uses additional classifiers for the similar class pair issue.</P>"
effective spectral and excitation modeling techniques for lstm-rnn-based speech synthesis systems,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>In this paper, we report research results on modeling the parameters of an improved time-frequency trajectory excitation (ITFTE) and spectral envelopes of an LPC vocoder with a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based recurrent neural network (RNN) for high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) systems. The ITFTE vocoder has been shown to significantly improve the perceptual quality of statistical parameter-based TTS systems in our prior works. However, a simple feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) with a finite window length is inadequate to capture the time evolution of the ITFTE parameters. We propose to use the LSTM to exploit the time-varying nature of both trajectories of the excitation and filter parameters, where the LSTM is implemented to use the linguistic text input and to predict both ITFTE and LPC parameters holistically. In the case of LPC parameters, we further enhance the generated spectrum by applying LP bandwidth expansion and line spectral frequency-sharpening filters. These filters are not only beneficial for reducing unstable synthesis filter conditions but also advantageous toward minimizing the muffling problem in the generated spectrum. Experimental results have shown that the proposed LSTM-RNN system with the ITFTE vocoder significantly outperforms both similarly configured band aperiodicity-based systems and our best prior DNN-trainecounterpart, both objectively and subjectively.</P>"

This is an important task because the user's location information may be inaccurate; furthermore, users may be unwilling to reveal their exact location for privacy reasons. Therefore, under this type of specific situation, the server returns candidate objects for every point on the road segments and the client evaluates and chooses exact <TEX>$ k$</TEX> nearest objects from the candidate objects. Evaluating the query results at each timestamp to keep the freshness of the query answer, while the query object is moving, will create significant computation burden for the client. We therefore propose an efficient approach called a safe-region-based approach (SRA) for computing a safe segment region and the safe exit points of a moving nearest neighbor (NN) query in a road network. SRA avoids evaluation of candidate answers returned by the location-based server since it will have high computation cost in the query side. Additionally, we applied SRA for a directed road network, where each road network has a particular orientation and the network distances are not symmetric. Our experimental results demonstrate that SRA significantly outperforms a conventional solution in terms of both computational and communication costs.</P>"

Many recent researches on WSD have widely used NNLM(Neural Network Language Model) in which neural network is used to represent a document into vectors and to analyze its semantics. Among the previous WSD researches using NNLM, RNN(Recurrent Neural Network) model has better performance than other models because RNN model can reflect the occurrence order of words in addition to the word appearance information in a document. However, since RNN model uses only the forward order of word occurrences in a document, it is not able to reflect natural language's characteristics that later words can affect the meanings of the preceding words. In this paper, we propose a WSD scheme using Bidirectional RNN that can reflect not only the forward order but also the backward order of word occurrences in a document. From the experiments, the accuracy of the proposed model is higher than that of previous method using RNN.

We trained a MTRNN with low-dimensional temporal patterns, and assessed performance on an imitation task employing these patterns. Analysis reveals that imitating fluctuated patterns consists in inferring optimal internal states by error regression. The model was then tested through humanoid robotic experiments requiring imitative interaction with human subjects. Results show that spontaneous and lively interaction can be achieved as the model successfully copes with fluctuations naturally occurring in human movement patterns.</P>"

However, greenhouse are classified as complex system, and need to make a sophisticated modeling. Furthermore, there is a difficulty in using classical control methods for complex process system due to the process are non linear and multi-output(MIMO) systems. In order to predict the time evolution of conditions in certain greenhouse as a function, we present here to use of recurrent neural networks(RNN) which has been used to implement the direct dynamics of the inside temperature and inside humidity of greenhouse. For the training, we used algorithm of a backpropagation Through Time (BPTT). Because the environmental parameters are shared by all time steps in the network, the gradient at each output depends not only on the calculations of the current time step, but also the previous time steps. The training data was emulated to 13 input variables during March 1 to 7, and the model was tested with database file of March 8. The RMSE of results of the temperature modeling was 0.976℃, and the RMSE of humidity simulation was 4.11%, which will be given to prove the performance of RNN in prediction of the greenhouse environment."

The apparent and distinct advantage of this LSTM model is that the relationship of nonlinear sensor data can be grasped and learned devoid of a mathematical model while using the time information. In this sense, the LKAS steering angle can be generated by predicting the movement of the vehicle in consideration of the past vehicle motion based on the sensor data. In addition, the time delay problem due to the difference of sampling time on each sensor can be simply solved by learning based on a time table which has a synchronized sampling time. The input values of the upper controller are the coefficient of the road model and the vehicle dynamic characteristics are obtained from the image processing data from the camera sensor. As for the target values, the steering angles in the next state are selected. The learning model was developed by learning the many-to-one LSTM prediction model with serial connection of LSTM and Fully-Connected (FC) Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). For implementation of the learning model, Tensorflow is employed and the data from a real test road was used. With this model, the learning is conducted and its effectiveness is shown by comparing with a LKAS lateral controller using a model-based multi rate Kalman Filter (MKF)."

Using a set of example sentences, a language model predicts the next word or character based on sequential input data. N-gram models have been widely used but this model cannot model the correlation between the input units efficiently since it is a probabilistic model which are based on the frequency of each unit in the training set. Recently, as the deep learning algorithm has been developed, a recurrent neural network (RNN) model and a long short-term memory (LSTM) model have been widely used for the neural language model (Ahn, 2016; Kim et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2016). These models can reflect dependency between the objects that are entered sequentially into the model (Gers and Schmidhuber, 2001; Mikolov et al., 2010; Sundermeyer et al., 2012). In order to learning the neural language model, texts need to be decomposed into words or morphemes. Since, however, a training set of sentences includes a huge number of words or morphemes in general, the size of dictionary is very large and so it increases model complexity. In addition, word-level or morpheme-level models are able to generate vocabularies only which are contained in the training set. Furthermore, with highly morphological languages such as Turkish, Hungarian, Russian, Finnish or Korean, morpheme analyzers have more chance to cause errors in decomposition process (Lankinen et al., 2016).  Therefore, this paper proposes a phoneme-level language model for Korean language based on LSTM models. A phoneme such as a vowel or a consonant is the smallest unit that comprises Korean texts. We construct the language model using three or four LSTM layers. Each model was trained using Stochastic Gradient Algorithm and more advanced optimization algorithms such as Adagrad, RMSprop, Adadelta, Adam, Adamax, and Nadam. Simulation study was done with Old Testament texts using a deep learning package Keras based the Theano. After pre-processing the texts, the dataset included 74 of unique characters including vowels, consonants, and punctuation marks. Then we constructed an input vector with 20 consecutive characters and an output with a following 21st character. Finally, total 1,023,411 sets of input-output vectors were included in the dataset and we divided them into training, validation, testsets with proportion 70:15:15. All the simulation were conducted on a system equipped with an Intel Xeon CPU (16 cores) and a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 GPU.  We compared the loss function evaluated for the validation set, the perplexity evaluated for the test set, and the time to be taken for training each model. As a result, all the optimization algorithms but the stochastic gradient algorithm showed similar validation loss and perplexity, which are clearly superior to those of the stochastic gradient algorithm. The stochastic gradient algorithm took the longest time to be trained for both 3- and 4-LSTM models. On average, the 4-LSTM layer model took 69% longer training time than the 3-LSTM layer model. However, the validation loss and perplexity were not improved significantly or became even worse for specific conditions. On the other hand, when comparing the automatically generated sentences, the 4-LSTM layer model tended to generate the sentences which are closer to the natural language than the 3-LSTM model. Although there were slight differences in the completeness of the generated sentences between the models, the sentence generation performance was quite satisfactory in any simulation conditions: they generated only legitimate Korean letters and the use of postposition and the conjugation of verbs were almost perfect in the sense of grammar. The results of this study are expected to be widely used for the processing of Korean language in the field of language processing and speech recognition, which are the basis of artificial intelligence systems."
continuous timescale long-short term memory neural network for human intent understanding,2017,"['continuous timescale', 'recurrent neural network', 'LSTM', 'classification', 'dynamic sequence']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Understanding of human intention by observing a series of human actions has been a challenging task. In order to do so, we need to analyze longer sequences of human actions related with intentions and extract the context from the dynamic features. The multiple timescales recurrent neural network (MTRNN) model, which is believed to be a kind of solution, is a useful tool for recording and regenerating a continuous signal for dynamic tasks. However, the conventional MTRNN suffers from the vanishing gradient problem which renders it impossible to be used for longer sequence understanding. To address this problem, we propose a new model named Continuous Timescale Long-Short Term Memory (CTLSTM) in which we inherit the multiple timescales concept into the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) that addresses the vanishing gradient problem. We design an additional recurrent connection in the LSTM cell outputs to produce a time-delay in order to capture the slow context. Our experiments show that the proposed model exhibits better context modeling ability and captures the dynamic features on multiple large dataset classification tasks. The results illustrate that the multiple timescales concept enhances the ability of our model to handle longer sequences related with human intentions and hence proving to be more suitable for complex tasks, such as intention recognition.</P>"
deep recurrent neural network for multiple time slot frequency spectrum predictions of cognitive radio,2017,"['cognitive radio', 'spectrum sensing', 'recurrent neural network', 'time series']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The main processes of a cognitive radio system include spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing, and spectrum conversion. Experimental results show that these stages introduce a time delay that affects the spectrum sensing accuracy, reducing its efficiency. To reduce the time delay, the frequency spectrum prediction was proposed to alleviate the burden on the spectrum sensing. In this paper, the deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) was proposed to predict the spectrum of multiple time slots, since the existing methods only predict the spectrum of one time slot. The continuous state of a channel is divided into a many time slots, forming a time series of the channel state. Since there are more hidden layers in the DRNN than in the RNN, the DRNN has fading memory in its bottom layer as well as in the past input. In addition, the extended Kalman filter was used to train the DRNN, which overcomes the problem of slow convergence and the vanishing gradient of the gradient descent method. The spectrum prediction based on the DRNN was verified with a WiFi signal, and the error of the prediction was analyzed. The simulation results proved that the multiple slot spectrum prediction improved the spectrum efficiency and reduced the energy consumption of spectrum sensing."

시점의 기업에 대한 최신 정보를 반영하고 있다는 특성이 있으므로 재무 정보의 적시성 부족 문제를 보완하나 유가증권 시장에 상장되어 주식이 거래되고 있는 기업들만의 정보를 이용한다는 한계· 재무 정보와 시장 정보는 두 정보를 결합하여 모형에 반영이 가능함. Nam et al.(2008)의 연구는 Hazard 모형을 활용하여 재무정보와 시장정보를 결합한 부도 예측 모형 제시· 거시경제 지표의 경우 과거 일부 부도 예측 연구에서 설명변수로 활용은 되고 있으나, 그 빈도가 재무지표나 시장지표에 비하여 많이 떨어짐.· 여러 선행연구에서 적용하는 비정형 정보는 그간에 연구들이 주로 사용하지 못하였던 뉴스 및 인터넷 등의 텍스트 정보를 원천으로 활용하는 경우가 많음.▣ 본 연구 분석 과정에서 활용한 예측 방법론의 종류와 각 방법론의 특징▣ 텍스트 데이터를 예측 모형 등에 활용하기 위해서는 계량화된 변수로 측정하는 과정이 필요· ‘Word2vec’은 단어들 간의 연관된 규칙을 찾아서 각 단어의 관계를 계량적으로 산출하는 방법론으로서, 각 단어 간의 앞뒤 관계를 보고 근접도를 벡터의 형태로 계산하는 알고리즘 · ‘Word2vec’을 활용하여 뉴스 기사 내에 언급된 단어 간의 관계를 계량적으로 분석할 수 있음.· 본 연구에서는 부도와 연관된 기사에서 나타나는 ‘부도’의 의미를 가지는 다른 단어들을 객관적으로 판단(‘부도 연관어휘’)하는 근거를 마련하여 위하여 ‘Word2vec’ 활용· 산출된 ‘부도 관련 기사 비율’과 ‘부도 유사도’ 지표는 수준이 높게 나타날 경우 이를 사전적인 ‘부도’의 징후로 판단할 수 있음.▣ 여러 가지 방법론을 적용하여 기업 부도예측을 수행할 경우 모형의 성능을 비교하기 위해서는 동일한 개념으로 적용이 가능한 객관적인 모형 평가 방법 필요· 본 연구의 기업 부도예측과 같은 이진 분류 예측의 상황은 두 범주(부도, 정상)간의 정확한 분류가 가능한지를 여러 모형 간에 비교하여 봄으로써 모형 평가를 수행· 기업예측 모형과 같은 이진 판별 예측은 할 때, 예측 모형의 추정 값들은 0에서 1 사이에서 판별 값(Threshold)이 변함에 따라 정확도가 변동함. 따라서 최적의 판별 값 수준 결정필요▣ 예측 모형을 도출하여 모형의 예측력을 평가하는 과정에서 Sample data를 학습 세트(training set)와 평가 세트(test set)으로 나누어 예측 정확도(Accuracy)를 산출하고 이를 근거로 모형의 성능을 평가하여야 함(out of sample test).· 본 연구도 학습 세트와 평가 세트를 전체 표본 중 중복되지 않도록 70% 대 30%의 비중으로 배분하여 모형 추정과 예측력 평가 과정에 각각 사용· 과거 부도예측 연구에서는 부도 기업의 표본(sample) 수가 너무 적어 표본의 불균형에 의한 모형 예측력 평가의 어려움이 있음을 한계로 지적하였음.· 본 연구는 부도 기업의 표본을 고정하고, 정상 기업의 표본을 부도 기업 수만큼만 Random 형태로 Sampling하여 균형(equal-weighted. 50% 대50%) 표본을 구성하여 모형의 추정과 평가에 활용하는 방안을 적용.· 다만 이러한 Sampling 방식을 사용할 경우 정상 기업 표본에서 표본 선택에 따른 편의(bias)가 발생할 수 있으므로, 평가 과정의 강건성을 얻기 위하여 정상 기업 표본을 반복적으로 총 100 세트(set)를 임의 확률(random)로 구성하여 모형평가 과정에 활용· 각 방법론의 예측 수준 평가를 위한 정확도 값은 모든 평가세트(100 set)에서 산출된 정확도의 평균 수준으로 산출Ⅳ. 실증분석1. 부도 사건의 정의▣ 기업 부도예측 연구 과정에서 보다 유용한 결과를 얻기 위해서는 기업의 부도(부실)에 대한 명확한 정의를 하는 것이 매우 중요▣ 유가증권시장에서 ‘상장폐지’가 결정된 기업들 중 부도에 관련된 공시가 발생한 기업들을 부도 발생기업으로 인식하고 분석을 진행· 이인로·김동철(2015), 최정원·오세경(2016) 등의 선행연구와 동일한 가정· 상장폐지 사건은 부도와 반드시 연결된다고 볼 수는 없으나, 부도와 관련된 이유로 상장폐지가 발생한 대부분의 기업은 특수한 상황을 제외하고 부도가 발생하거나 부도에 준하는 재무상황이 발생함.2. 데이터 수집 및 정제▣ 2001년부터 2015년 까지 부도 정의에 따라 유가증권 시장에 상장된 기업을 대상으로 분석▣ 비정형 정보인 뉴스 텍스트 데이터 수집을 위하여, 네이버 뉴스 검색 홈페이지를 활용하여, 분석 대상 기업들에 대한 2010년 1월부터 2016년 12월까지의 84기간의 뉴스 컨텐츠를 수집· 인터넷 뉴스 서버에 DB가 구축되지 않아 기사를 확보할 수 없거나, 총 집계기간 동안 기사 수가 부족한 기업, 검색이 불가능한 이름의 기업, 명확한 구별이 어려운 기업 등의 기사는 수집 과정에서 제외· 제외 후 텍스트 정보 수집 대상 기업은 총 1,788개의 기업으로 총 2,506,080건의 기사를 텍스트 DB로 확보함. 기업당 평균적으로 약 1,401건, 1개월 당 평균적으로 약 16.6건· 텍스트 DB는 집계 이후 자연어 처리, 분석 Sample 수 미달제외, 특정 의미 단어 제외 등의 정제 과정을 거쳐 최종 텍스트 분석 DB로 산출됨.▣ 텍스트 분석 DB를 기반으로 ‘부도’ 및 ‘상장폐지’와 기사 내에 언급된 단어 간의 유사도를 ‘Word2vec’을 이용하여 산출· ‘부도’ 혹은 ‘부도’ 및 ‘상장폐지’로 ‘Word2vec’ 유사도 기준상위 20개 단어 선별· 선정된 부도 유사 단어가 포함된 경우 해당 기사를 부도 연관 기사로 간주하고, 전체 기사 대비 부도 연관 기사 비율을 산출하여 ‘부도 기사 비율’을 산출함.· 기사를 구성하고 있는 개별 단어별로 ‘부도’ 및 ‘상장폐지’ 유사도를 부여하고, 각 기사별 ‘부도 유사도(평균수준)’을 산출함.· ‘부도 기사 비율’ 과 ‘부도 유사도’ 는 부도 기사에 대한 계량화된 텍스트 분석 결과로서 향후 부도 예측 모형 추정 과정에서 설명 변수로 활용▣ 정보 원천별로 모형 예측의 영향을 평가하기 위하여 취합된 분석 DB를 4가지의 데이터 세트로 분류하여 각각의 모형에 적용하고 가용한 데이터 수준에 따라 기간을 나누어 분석함.· 총 7개의 분석 Set가 구성되어 각각의 예측 방법론에 적용됨1) Set A(2001~2016년) : 재무, 시장, 거시경제 정보. 총 2291개 (부도 502개) 기업 대상2) Set B(2010~2016년) : 재무, 시장, 거시경제 정보. 총 1586개 (부도 258개) 기업 대상3. 연간 예측 모형▣ 각 분석 DB Set를 예측 방법론별 모형에 적합(Fitting) 하고 최적 모형을 도출함.▣ SET A 결과(분석기간 2001년~2016년 적용)· 가장 높은 정확도를 나타낸 방법론은 Random Forests 방법론 · 로지스틱 모형과 SVM 또한 0.9에 상회하는 높은 정확도가 산출· 의사결정나무(Dtree)와 인공신경망(DNN, RNN) 등은 0.9에 다소 못 미치는 정확도· 기업의 재무정보, 거시 경제정보, 시장정보를 포괄하여 가장 정보가 많이 활용된 < SET3 >의 정확도는 타 데이터 세트에 비하여 다소 높게 산출. 하지만 유의미한 수준은 아님.▣ SET B 결과(분석기간 2010년~2016년 적용)· Random Forests 방법론이 가장 우수한 예측력. SVM, 인공신경망(DNN) 순· 로지스틱 모형은 상대적으로 모형 예측력이 하락. 인공지능 기법들의 예측력은 유지되거나 오히려 다소 상승· 기존 전통적 정보 원천이 반영된 < SET B_3 >에 뉴스 텍스트 정보까지 추가로 반영된 < SET B_4 >가 타 모형에 비하여 모형 예측력이 높게 산출. 비정형 정보도 부도예측 성능 향상에 영향을 줄 수 있음을 실증하는 결과임. 유의성은 떨어짐.▣ 연관 예측 모형 추정 결과 인공지능 중 Random Forests 방법론이 두 데이터 SET 모두 가장 높은 수준의 예측력 나타남.· 데이터 수가 상대적으로 적은 < SET B >에서도 우수한 예측력을 유지함으로써 인공지능 기법이 강건하게 기업의 부도에 대한 예측을 잘 수행할 수 있음을 실증· 인공지능_DNN의 예측 성능이 기대 수준에 미치지 못함. 컴퓨터 하드웨어를 보강하고 추가적인 효율화 방안을 도입하여 이러한 구조를 개선하면 현재보다 더 높은 예측 정확도를 얻을 가능성이 있음.▣ 텍스트 데이터를 추가로 반영한 < SET B_4 >의 예측 정확도는 방법론에 따라 약간의 차이는 있지만 전반적으로 텍스트 데이터를 반영하지 않은 SET에 비하여 유의한 수준의 정확도 차이가 나타나지 않음.· 재무정보만 활용한 < SET A_1 >, < SET B_1 >의 예측력도 타SET에 비하여 큰 차이가 없음.· 이는 상장 기업의 경우 다양한 공시 요구 및 규제에 의하여 기업의 정보가 재무정보에 이미 충분히 반영되어 나타나는 결과라 판단됨.4. 월간 예측 모형▣ 미디어의 뉴스 기사는 시장 정보(주가)와 마찬가지로 실시간으로 공개되는 정보임. 따라서 시장정보를 활용한 예측 모형인 KMV 모형과 유사한 형태의 부도예측 모형 구축 가능· 기업의 부도 관련 뉴스가 실제 부도가 발생하는 시점 이전에 부도 가능성을 선제적으로 알려줄 수 있는지, 조기 경보 지표(early warning index)로서 활용 가치가 있는지 연구· 분석 가능 대상 Sample : 부도 기업 52개, 정상기업 855개 확보· KMV모형 및 텍스트 기반 모형의 부도예측 단위는 월간이며, 부도 기준 직전 12개월의 추이를 분석함.· 부도 기업의 경우 부도 발생 1년전부터 점진적으로 평균 수준에 비하여 다소 낮은 수준으로 D.D. 가 하락하다가, 부도발생 3개월 전부터 급격하게 하락함.▣ 텍스트 정보기반 예측 모형 산출 결과(부도 기사 비율 추이)· 동일한 기간과 동일한 기업에 대하여 기사 텍스트 DB를 기반으로 산출한 부도 기사 비율· KMV 모형과 마찬가지로 부도기사 비율은 부도 발생 12개월 이전부터 점진적으로 상승하여 지속적으로 정상기업에 비하여 높은 수준으로 산출▣ 텍스트 정보기반 예측 모형 산출 결과(부도 유사도 추이)· 동일한 기간과 동일한 기업에 대하여 기사 텍스트 DB를 기반으로 산출한 부도 유사도· 부도 유사도 역시 부도기사비율과 마찬가지로 부도발생 이전부터 정상기업과 차이가 나타남.· 단, KMV 와 부도기사비율과는 달리 점진적 상승 추세가 다소 약하고, 부도 시점에 가까워지면서 오히려 정상기업보다 떨어지는 수준도 나타나는 것을 확인할 수 있음.▣ KMV 모형과 텍스트 정보기반의 예측 모형은 각각 부도 발생 이전 시점부터 부도 가능성이 상승함을 보여주는 것을 확인할 수 있음.· 선제적 예측 성능을 비교하기 위하여 두 모형을 함께 그래프로 도식화· 부도 기사 비율은 KMV 모형의 결과인 D.D. 와 비슷한 형태로 부도 가능성에 대한 신호가 나타남.· 특히 부도 발생 6개월 이전 시점부터는 지속적으로 KMV모형보다 다소 높은 수준으로 부도 기사 비율이 나타남.▣ ‘부도 기사비율’과 ‘부도 유사도’를 활용할 경우 KMV 모형과 유사한 형태로 부도 예측이 가능하며 추가적인 확장도 가능함.· 부도 발생 시점을 기준으로 KMV 모형 보다 이전 기간에 부도 유사도가 상승하여 기업 부도에 대한 조기경보 지표로서 충분히 활용 가능성이 있음.· 텍스트 정보 기반의 부도예측은 주가 정보가 없는 비상장기업에도 활용이 가능하다는 점에서 KMV 의 단점을 보완하는 방법론으로 더욱 의미가 있음.▣ 텍스트 기반의 부도 예측 방법 또한 기업관련 뉴스의 편중 문제가 나타나는 단점이 있음.· 대부분의 기업 뉴스는 일부 매우 우량하고 유명한 대기업에 대한 기사가 많이 생성되고, 정작 부도가 많이 발생하는 규모가 작은 기업에 대한 뉴스는 상대적으로 매우 적음.· 향후 이를 보완하기 위해서는 텍스트 데이터 확보 정보 원천을 미디어 뉴스뿐만 아니라 기업 공시자료, 증권/투자 관련게시판, 해당기업 홈페이지 등으로 확대하여 보다 광범위한 텍스트 데이터의 확보가 필요함.Ⅴ. 결론 및 시사점▣ 기업 부도 예측 과정에서 우선 비정형 데이터인 뉴스 텍스트 데이터를 계량화하여 새로운 정보 원천으로 활용할 수 있는 방법을 제시▣ 기존 정보 원천과 함께 텍스트 정보를 포함한 인공지능 기반의 예측 방법론을 제시하고 기존의 방법론과 예측력을 비교분석▣ 연구 결과, 연간 모형에서는 인공지능 기법인 Random forests 기법이 가장 우수한 예측력이 나타나는 것으로 분석· 인공지능을 이용한 다른 방법론들도 전반적으로 기존의 전통적인 예측 방법보다 예측력이 우수함.▣ 또한 뉴스 텍스트를 추가적인 정보 원천으로 추정한 월간 예측 모형의 경우 시장 정보 기반의 예측 모형인 KMV 모형과 유사한 결론을 도출할 수 있는 것으로 나타남.· 기업 부도 예측 과정에서 텍스트 정보 기반의 부도 예측 모형은 조기 경보 모형으로 충분히 활용이 가능함.▣ 중소기업(SME)과 개인에 대한 부도 예측 모형으로 연구의 확장이 필요· 현재 분석 대상인 상장기업의 경우 재무 정보가 기업 현황을 비교적 잘 반영하고 있고, 기업에 대하여 발생하는 정보 또한 주가에 즉각 반영되고 있는 편이기 때문에 텍스트 정보 및 인공지능 도입에 대한 예측 증가 수준이 미미할 수 있음.· 재무정보의 신뢰도가 떨어지고 시장 정보의 확보가 어려운 중소기업이나 개인에 대하여 본 연구의 부도 예측 방법을 적용한다면 기존의 방법에 대하여 추가적인 예측 수준 증대를 얻을 수 있을 것으로 기대됨.· 기업을 대상으로 하는 연구의 경우, 뉴스 텍스트 정보와 함께 웹 페이지, 공시자료 등 추가적인 정보 원천을 포괄하여 적용하면 추가적인 예측 수준 개선이 기대됨.▣ 빅데이터 및 딥-러닝 분야는 아직까지 국내 금융, 재무 분야에서 관련 연구가 부족함.· 본 연구에서 활용한 방법론은 타 연구에서도 충분히 응용하여 활용이 가능하므로 향후 관련 된 연구가 많이 발전할 것이라 기대할 수 있음.",다국어 초록 정보 없음
nonintrusive load monitoring based on advanced deep learning and novel signature,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Monitoring electricity consumption in the home is an important way to help reduce energy usage. Nonintrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is existing technique which helps us monitor electricity consumption effectively and costly. NILM is a promising approach to obtain estimates of the electrical power consumption of individual appliances from aggregate measurements of voltage and/or current in the distribution system. Among the previous studies, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based models have been studied very much. However, increasing appliances, multistate of appliances, and similar power consumption of appliances are three big issues in NILM recently. In this paper, we address these problems through providing our contributions as follows. First, we proposed state-of-the-art energy disaggregation based on Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) model and additional advanced deep learning. Second, we proposed a novel signature to improve classification performance of the proposed model in multistate appliance case. We applied the proposed model on two datasets such as UK-DALE and REDD. Via our experimental results, we have confirmed that our model outperforms the advanced model. Thus, we show that our combination between advanced deep learning and novel signature can be a robust solution to overcome NILM's issues and improve the performance of load identification.</P>"
effect of kinetic parameters on simultaneous ramp reactivity insertion plus beam tube flooding accident in a typical low enriched u3si2-al fuel based mtr-type research reactor,2017,"['Beam Tube Flooding Accidents', 'Kinetic Parameters', 'MTR System', 'Research Reactors', 'Simultaneous Ramp Reactivity Accidents']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This work looks at the effect of changes in kinetic parameters on simultaneous reactivityinsertions and beam tube flooding in a typical material testing reactor-type researchreactor with low enriched high density (U3Si2-Al) fuel. Using a modified PARET code,various ramp reactivity insertions (from $0.1/0.5 s to $1.3/0.5 s) plus beam tube flooding($0.5/0.25 s) accidents under uncontrolled conditions were analyzed to find their effects onpeak power, net reactivity, and temperature. Then, the effects of changes in kinetic parametersincluding the Doppler coefficient, prompt neutron lifetime, and delayed neutronfractions on simultaneous reactivity insertion and beam tube flooding accidents wereanalyzed. Results show that the power peak values are significantly sensitive to theDoppler coefficient of the system in coupled accidents. The material testing reactor-typesystem under such a coupled accident is not very sensitive to changes in the promptneutron life time; the core under such a coupled transient is not very sensitive to changesin the effective delayed neutron fraction."

For example, the volatility of Korean net inflows is larger than that of U.S. Also, the redemption rate of Korea is higher than US. Also, there are net outflows in the Korean world equity funds while inflows in the U.S after the global financial crisis.  We analyze the effect of financial market variables and change of stock market return to net inflows of domestic and world equity funds in Korea and U.S.  The main findings are as follows: First, world equity funds are affected by domestic stock return. The Korean world equity funds are more influenced by domestic stock variables such as return and volatility. Second, there is no substitution relationship between domestic and world equity funds in Korea and US, which implies investment into domestic and world equity funds are not offset.  The results imply that the vitalization of world equity funds is needed along with that of domestic equity funds as well as the stabilization of equity markets."
日本私法における一括清算と三者間相殺,2017,"['derivatives', 'set-off', 'reciprocity', 'act relating to the close out netting', 'insolvency procedure code', 'délégation parfaite', 'デリバティブ', '相殺', '相互性', '一括清算法', '民事再生法', '完全嘱託']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"[1] X (corp. ltd.), a Japanese subsidiary of Lehman Bros. U.S., had continued with its counterpart Y (corp. ltd., professional bank-trustee) through derivative contracts, mainly about interest rate and foreign currency swaps. The X also had contractual relations of the same nature with the Z (corp. ltd., stocks investment broker-bank, sister company of the Y). Between the Y and the X there was a clause in this ISDA master agreement, which allowed the “close-out netting”, operation called as “set-off” of “early terminiated” swaps. This clause also provides that the Y may invoke the sett-off of its debt to the X with the claim of the Z against X (operation called “triangular set-off”). However, the Z had agreed to the clause only after the X's procedure opening.[2] September 19, 2008, the court of first instance of Tokyo declared the opening of the insolvency procedure of the X. On 1 October, two weeks after the opening date, the Z belatedly notified X and Y of its agreement to the clause in this “triangular set-off” agreement. X demand the Y for the payment of the netting balance.[3] The Tokyo Court of Appeal dismissed this claim of X considering that by the effect of the triangular netting clause previously entered into between the X and Y in the form of the ISDA Master Agreement, the right of claim of the X against the Y had been extinguished by the set-off with a right of claim that a third (the Z) could exert against the X.[4] The Supreme Court, however, ordered the Y to pay the X the sum of the netting balance by rejecting the interpretation that the Court of Appeal retained.[5] Set-off is an institution the purpose of which is to enable parties who have reciprocal claims (of the same object and due) to settle them by a simple and fair process. In the case, because between the X and the Y the reciprocity of the debts had not been found until the end, so the Y can not invoke the set-off towards the X.[6] The judgment of the Court of Appeal and its supporters believe that, without require the reciprocity between two parties, the effectiveness of set-off invoked by the Y to third parties might be justified by the application of an interpretation derived from a judgment of the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court of 24 June 1970, Minshu 24.6.587 which protected the expectation of the third-party debtor (bank) to oppose the extinguishment of its premature debt by set-off reserved by agreement against the seizing creditor.[7] The Supreme Court rightly rejected this confused idea, by applying the art. 92 of the Code of Civil Recovery Procedure. Because the judgment of 1970 implied the reciprocity of claims for set-off.[8] The author emphasizes that in the conception of set-off in Japanese (Sousai), French (compensation) and English private law, the reciprocity between two debts is always an absolute and indispensable condition of this operation. By an assignment of debt (cession de créance; the Z transfers to the Y its claim right against the X) or an assignment of debt (cession de dette; the Z takes over the debt of the Y against the X) become effective before the date of the proceedings, the parties may indirectly create the situation of reciprocity. Apart from this method, they can also use an institution by the triangular agreement for the replacement of the two debts to one: délégationnovatoire (“KanzenShokutaku” in Japanese Civil Code 1890 of Boissonade) [9] Finally, the author wants to clarify the confines of terminology. The term triangular “set-off” is often used in various cases. There are, in fact, (1) the applications of codified triangular set-off in the strict sense of the Japanese Civil Code. The surety person and the ceded debtor those who can oppose the set-off to the defined third parties; (2) the case of the délégation novatoire (triangular “set-off” is its pseudonomy); (3) the case of the extension of the insolvency procedure to the other legal person, when ..."
개인연금과 퇴직연금의 연계방안에 관한 연구,2017,"['Defined Contribution pension', 'Defined Benefit pension', 'Individual Retirement Pension', 'Rollover', 'Superannuation', 'ERISA', 'Aging Society', 'consolidated pension account', '확정기여형 퇴직연금', '확정급여형 퇴직연금', '개인형 퇴직연금', '계약이전', '슈퍼에뉴에이션(호주)', '근로자퇴직급여보장법(미국)', '고령화 사회', '통합연금계좌']","우리나라의 노후보장 연금제도는 기본적으로 3층 구조에 의한다. 이 글은 공적인 성격으로 인해 고유의 법리가 적용되는 공적연금(국민연금) 이외의 2, 3층의 사적연금인 퇴직연금과 개인연금을 어떻게 효율적으로 운용할 것인가를 다루고 있다. 2층의 퇴직연금은 근로자의 퇴직 후 생활재원을 사용자의 자금으로 (일부) 충당하는 것에서 비롯된 것이므로, 규제적, 강제적 성격이 강하다. 반면 3층의 개인연금은 그것이 연금저축이든연금보험이든 세제유인 및 개인의 자율적 판단에 따라 이루어진다. 이 같은 성격의 차이에도 불구하고 노후 생활보장이라는 궁극적인 목적은 동일하기 때문에 이를 통합하거나 연계하여 운영할 필요성이 커지고 있다.먼저 기존 제도를 살펴볼 때, 퇴직연금 내부에서의 상호 전환은 법리상불가능하지는 않지만 그다지 흔하지 않다. 개인연금 내부에서 예컨대 연금저축 금융기관을 변경하는 것은 명시적으로 허용되는바, 특히 2015. 4. 이후에는 신규 가입 금융기관을 한번만 방문하여 계약이전할 수 있도록절차가 간소화된바 있다. 퇴직연금과 개인연금의 상호 전환은 그동안 금지되었으나, 2016. 2. 소득세법 개정을 통해 IRP와 연금저축 사이의 계약이전이 허용된바 있다. 그러나 이러한 계약이전은 가입자가 퇴직 또는 55 세에 달한 경우에 한하여 가입금액 전체에 관하여 가능한 등 일정한 한계가 있다.해외의 경우 호주의 슈퍼에뉴에이션(Superannuation)의 경우 사용자가의무적으로 출연하는 강제성 출연금 이외에 근로자가 스스로 급여 일부를 출연하는 자발적 출연금을 포괄한다. 따라서 실질적으로 2층의 강제퇴직연금과 3층의 개인연금이 통합되어 운영되는 효과를 갖게 된다. 한국미국의 경우 2층 퇴직연금제도는 401(k)에 의하고 3층의 개인연금제도는개인퇴직계좌(IRA)에 의한다. 401(k)와 개인퇴직계좌는 세금납부 방식에따라 각기 전통형과 Roth형으로 구분된다. 이들 퇴직연금과 개인연금은각기 다른 법령 및 역사에 의해 발전되어 온 것으로 그 자체를 통합 운영하지는 않는다. 하지만 우리나라의 계약이전과 유사한 Rollover를 통하법제연구 / 제52호86 주제어 : 확정기여형 퇴직연금, 확정급여형 퇴직연금, 개인형 퇴직연금, 계약이전, 슈퍼에뉴에이션(호주), 근로자퇴직급여보장법(미국), 고령화 사회, 통합연금계좌여 가입자가 개인연금과 퇴직연금 사이에서 전환할 수 있도록 함으로써 연계를 인정하고 있다.향후 가급적 퇴직연금과 개인연금의 연계를 위한 방안을 모색할 필요가 있다. 먼저 DC형과 연금저축, 연금보험의 자유로운 계약이전을 인정해야 한다. 또한 고용복지부는 조만간 기금형 퇴직연금제도를 도입할 예정인바, 이러한 제도가 도입된다면 DC와 IRP를 통합하는 것이 바람직할것이다.","As found in other countries, the Korean safety net for aging population is composed of public pension fund (i.e. “National Pension Fund”) and private pension fund. This paper focuses upon private pension fund because National Pension Fund is supposed to operate under unique logic reflecting its public feature. The private pension fund in Korea comprises retirement pension and individual pension. While the retirement pension is basically associated with a person’s employment and of mandatory nature, the individual pension is based upon a person’s choice for further savings. The retirement pension and individual pension, however, have the same goal in their cores: to provide a person with financial support when economic activities get no more active. This paper starts from the idea that accumulated assets management will benefit the investors according to the economy of scale theorem and the combined management of both retirement pension and individual pension would contribute to the wealth maximization of pensioners.In order to explore the possible combination of retirement pension and individual pension, the paper begins with the analysis of current system for associating two pensions (Chapter II to IV). The types of retirement pension include DB(Defined Benefit), DC(Defined Contribution) and IRP(Individual Retirement Pension). On the other hands, individual pension may be classified as non-taxable individual pension and taxable individual pension, the former being the typical one. The current legislations in Korea enables the rollover among various retirement pension schemes or among various individual pension schemes. When it comes to the rollover between ‘retirement pension scheme’ and ‘individual pension scheme’, however, only limited type transfers are allowed: only if a person reach the age of 55, one may apply for the rollover; and a partial rollover is not possible.Chapter V of the paper further reviews foreign models. Under the Australian Superannuation system, the pension fund include both compulsory contribution by employers and voluntary contribution by individuals. Actually an individual may enjoy the economy of scale from combined management. In the United State, the rollovers between 401(k) (i.e. U.S. style retirement pension) and IRA (i.e. U.S. style individual pension) are broadly plausible, while detailed regulation according to conventional or roth scheme might often be triggered.In Chapter VI, the paper suggests the way to achieve efficiency in private pension management. First the retirement pension structure should be reformed so that the pension property should not be influenced by the employer’s direction. Secondly, the DC and IRP should be merged into one scheme."

However, robo-advisors are making sudden rises during the on-going FinTech revolution. Robo-advisors aim to provide personalized wealth management services for everyone by using automated investment management algorithms and online distribution channels. To reduce service costs, robo-advisors mainly use ETFs to construct investment portfolios. Therefore, Korean ETF market should grow in both quantity and quality, in order for robo-advisors to succeed in Korea. In this study, we first analyze how vulnerable the Korean ETF market is to external or internal shocks in comparison with the U.S. ETF market. Then, we derive the optimal introduction sequence of ETFs in the Korean ETF market based on the modern portfolio theory."

For this purpose, 7th NaSTaB(National Survey of Tax and Benefit) of Korea Institute of Public Finance in Korea and 2013 SCF(Survey of Consumer Finances) of FRB in U.S. were used. For theoretical model, simplified life cycle model was applied to retirement income replacement rate approach. This approach has been used widely to study adequacy of retirement income in previous studies. This is one adequacy measure to assess how well retirees can maintain pre-retirement levels of consumption. This provides information regarding the living standard during retirement years, which is relative to the living standard during pre-retirement years. Three benchmarks were used in this study; pre-retirement income(rep1), poverty threshold in retirement(rep2), and total wealth at retirement(rep3).The rep2 was very higher for the U.S. sample compared with the Korean sample, and the rep1 and rep3 were not much different among the two countries. Not controlling for other factors, income, non-financial wealth, total wealth, and net wealth were significant factors affecting the three personal pension replacement rates in Korea, and more various factors influenced on the three replacement rates in the U.S. On the other hand, compared with the U.S., large variations of the three replacement rates among sub-sample were found in Korea. After controlling for other factors, householders’ education level and occupation, and financial and non-financial wealth were crucial determinants of the three personal pension replacement rates in Korea. Results of this study provide useful implications for future personal pension system and tax policy in Korea."

In the United States, as a way of encouraging work strategy, it was designed to provide tax exemptions for people with no taxable income on the basis of their work, small benefits to people with lower incomes, and high pay for people with higher incomes. Canada, on the contrast, has been shown to provide a large benefit to the poor, non-working households, and as other income level be increased, benefits were designed to decline increasingly in the NIT/GI program. The NIT for social relocation in Canada depends on the Beveridge tradition of the welfare state, emphasizing universal, fixed, and civil rights as a conditions of entitlement compared to the EITC in the United States. These differences resulted in a dramatic increase in inequality in the United States, while mitigation of it in Canada. The distinctive features of NIT/GI, that is the increase of worker’s net income, gradual decrease and extinction of high incomer’s basic income by tax back rate, adjustment of complicated deduction and tax benefits, integration to guaranteed income of various cash expenditure, simplification of administrative system, and effects of cost saving were worth reviewing of applicability to the Korean society. The GI approach, using NIT and clawback, will increase the likelihood of political compromise in the patience range over the ideological division of liberals and conservatives. In particular, basic income policy using tax back rate to high incomer can develop to “catch-all policy” to the left and right."

FIO의 주된 기능은 감독기능인데, Dodd-Frank법에 의거하여 시스템 위기의 원인이 될 수 있는 보험회사의 규제에 있어서의 문제점 등을 파악하는 것을 포함하여 보험산업의 모든 측면을 감시하는 것이다. 그러나 Dodd-Frank법은 MCFA에서 규정된 바와 같이 분권화된 주법중심주의를 유지하고 있음으로 인하여 FIO의 실질적인 권한은 거의 없다.1985년 OCC는 연방은행의 확정형 연금의 판매를 허용하였고, 1990년 변액연금의 판매를 허용했다. 1995년 연방최고법원은 OCC의 결정을 지지했고, 연금은 보험상품이 아니고 투자상품이라고 판시했다. 1996년 연방최고법원은 연방은행이 보험상품을 판매할 수 있다고 판시했다. 1999년 GLBA는 미국에서 은행과 보험회사 간에 존재하던 진입장벽을 제거하면서 방카슈랑스 발전을 촉진했다.은행이 방카슈랑스 시장을 매력적이라고 보는 이유는 다음과 같은 몇 가지가 있다. 첫째는 수익의 다각화이다. 보험업에 진입하여 비이자수입을 확대함으로써, 은행들은 수익성을 희생하지 않고도 자신의 순이자 마진위험의 일부를 분산시킬 수 있다. 둘째는 규모의 경제이다. 은행들은 독립적인, 소규모의 보험 대리점/중개인에 비하여 낮은 비용으로 보험을 판매할 수 있는데, 이는 자신의 기존의 대규모의 고객을 대상으로 판매할 수 있으며, 자신의 영업권 내에서의 상당한 브랜드 인지도를 이용함으로써 광고비를 낮추고, 기존의 피용자들을 보험판매인력으로 활용할 수 있기 때문이다. 셋째는 자신의 고객기반을 확장하고 보호할 수 있다.OCC의 보험업에 대한 업무편람집은 은행업자 및 연방은행검사자에 대해서 연방은행의 보험업와 관련된 위험, 통제 및 감독에 대한 정보를 제공한다. 또한 동 업무편람집은 보험업과 관련된 법적 요건의 복합성 및 중요성을 고려하여 상당한 법적 지침사항도 제시하고 있다.","It is the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945--which provides that federal antitrust laws are inapplicable to the “business of insurance . . . to the extent that such business is regulated by State Law”--that remains the central federal insurance statute and is the linchpin of the contemporary state-centered insurance regime. In each state, insurance regulation is overseen by a state insurance department, which is led by an insurance commissioner. State insurance departments pursue two overarching goals: (1) consumer protection, through a variety of measures such as price-setting, licensing requirements, and product disclosure requirements (often referred to as “market conduct” rules); and (2) maintaining the solvency of insurance companies operating within the state.The most prominent of Dodd-Frank’s insurance-related reforms is that it establishes the FIO, the first federal regulatory agency explicitly tasked with addressing the insurance industry. The FIO’s main function is supervisory--under the Act, it is “to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry, including identifying issues or gaps in the regulation of insurers that could contribute to a systemic crisis. Dodd-Frank maintains the decentralized state-led system as provided by McCarran- Ferguson. As currently constituted, the FIO has deceptively little power.In 1985, the Office of the Comptroller and Currency (OCC) granted national banks the right to sell fixed-rate annuities. In 1990, the right to sell variable-rate annuities was granted. In 1995, the Supreme Court upheld the OCC’s decisions, and ruled that annuities are not insurance products, but investment products. In 1996, the Supreme Court further ruled that nationally chartered banks may sell insurance. In 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act removed the remaining regulatory barriers between banks and insurers, facilitating the further development of bancassurance in the U.S.There are several reasons why banks may find the bancassurance attractive. The first reason is to diversify revenues. By entering insurance and expanding non-interest-income, banks can diversify some of their net interest rate margin risk without sacrificing profitability. The second reason is economies of scope. Banks may be able to sell insurance at a lower cost than the independent, small agencies/ brokerages by targeting its existing, sizable customer base, using their existing employees as an insurance sales force. The third reason is to expand and protect their existing customer base.The “Insurance Activities” handbook of OCC provides information for bankers and national bank examiners on the risks, controls and supervision of national banks’' insurance activities by the OCC. Because of the complexity and importance of the legal requirements associated with insurance activities, this handbook also contains considerable legal guidance."

Unlike the United States, Korea and Spain, which have similar family structures, have low wealth inequality levels and a high share of real estate wealth. This study focuses on the verification of the equalizing effect hypothesis of housing wealth out of the wealth inequality decision theories. The results show that this hypothesis was not supported in Korea, unlike Spain, which is regarded as an example of supporting the inequality mitigation hypothesis of housing wealth. In Korea, inequality between home ownership group and non-homeowner group determines the total net wealth inequality is significantly higher than in Spain and the United States, and the inequality contribution of real estate such as residential and non-residential real estate is also high. These results suggest that real estate policy should concentrate more on policies to reduce the gap between homeowners and non-owners than within non-homeowners, and institutions, policies, cultures other than family structure factors should be considered more."

Additionally, DOLS and FMOLS methods were applied to estimate long-run cointegration vectors. Although there are long-run equilibrium relationships for tested models, any theoretical model of exchange rate determination does not fit well with the empirical results. However, in sum, the flow approach model is more useful than the monetary-based models. In the estimation of the unrestricted models, we found that the macro variables of the U.S. are more effective and statistically significant than those of Korea. To analyze the short-run influential factors, generalized impulse response and generalized variance decompositiontechniques are employed. We found that in the short-run, additional variables (domestic stock price, foreign stock net buying, dollar index, among others) are more effective and statistically significant rather than macroeconomic variables that are included in the theoretical models of exchange rate determination."

We find that a decrease in special items reverses almost completely through one-year-ahead earnings, whereas an increase in special items is positively associated with the next year’s earnings growth. We also find that the information embedded in changes in special items is incremental to that of fundamental signals documented in the literature, thereby identifying changes in special items as an additional fundamental signal. Furthermore, we find that both an increase and a decrease in special items lead to decreases in future sales and net operating assets, suggesting an inverse U-shaped relation between changes in special items and growth in these measures. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of considering various growth measures in understanding the implication of changes in special items for future firm growth.</P>"

Since the initial launching in 1999 in Bahrain, the Dow Jones Islamic MarketTM Indices (DJIMI) have become the industry benchmark in Islamic investments around the globe. In this paper, we aim to investigate the daily characteristics of dynamic return spillovers of DJIMI across 18 sectors. For empirical methods, we use the generalized spillover definition and measurements developed by Diebold, Yilmaz (2012). The static full-sample analysis shows that 82.90% of forecast error variance from return spillovers under time-invariant assumption. On the other hand, the rolling-sample analysis observes different pattern of total return spillover from Diebold, Yilmaz (2012) and Lee, Chang (2013) during the U.S. credit crisis (2008-2009), and ongoing European debt crisis (2012-present). In the analyses of time-varying directional and net directional return spillovers, we come upon that the DJIM indices are less connected to other parts of the world, contrasting to Diebold, Yilmaz (2012) and Lee, Chang (2013). These findings strongly suggest that DJIMI should be included in the construction of global portfolio to considerably increase the diversification benefit both for individual and professional investors."

In fact, the expectation that a fraud firm is likely to improve corporate governance is not self－explanatory. Whether a firm will improve corporate governance after fraud detection is determined by the comparison of the benefits to be obtained and the costs to be spent. Prior studies based on the U.S. firms provide the evidence that fraud firms generally expect the net benefits from the improvement of corporate governance to be positive. However, considering the properties of ownership structure which Korean firms establish, it is unclear that the evidence from prior studies can be consistently extended to the prediction for Korean firms. Despite the necessity of doing research on Korean firms, little research has been performed up to now. This study will help fill the gap between the results of prior studies and the Korean domestic business practice.The results of this study are as follows. First, the degree of corporate governance improvement by fraud firms over three subsequent periods after fraud detection is statistically significantly higher than that by non－fraud firms. This implies that fraud firms in Korea also expect the net benefits from the improvement of corporate governance after fraud detection to be positive. Second, it is found that it takes more than two subsequent periods that the quality of corporate governance of fraud firms is significantly improved, compared to that of non－fraud firms. This shows that the improvement of corporate governance is the restructuring process which requires considerable time and efforts."

There are various legal arguments whether it is appropriate for the investigatory organization which is charged with identifying criminals and seeking punishment to intervene with the protection of victims through the recovering of criminal proceeds. Under the current Proceeds of Crime Act, the confiscation of victim s property of a predicate offense is prohibited so that victims themselves can file civil lawsuits for damage recovery. On the contrary America is adopting various systems for protection of victims such as restitution or remission. Recently Supreme Prosecutors’ Office collected criminal proceeds worth around 1 million dollars hidden in the U.S. with the help of U.S. Attorney s Office and distributed the proceeds to the local victims through remissionprocess. It s the first case since we introduced our modern criminal justice system. As we didn t adopt remission system, this article is like a clinical test report. The purpose of this article is to provide the reader with actual practical information to judge whether the introduction of distribution of criminal proceeds to the victims like  remission  is right for our criminal justice system with a view to our social situation.Recovering of Criminal Proceeds to the Victims corresponds with both the constitutional clause on state duty to guarantee the human rights and basic purpose of the Crime Victim Protection Act. Distinction between civil law and criminal law in the area of protecting the victims from crime is becoming blurred in that every security net of society is aimed to control the illegal acts. At the early stage of fraud investigation, it is probably easy for law enforcement officers(LEOs) to detect hidden criminal proceeds. The criminals are inclined to cooperate with the LEOs to escape severe punishment. With the introduction of returning the criminal proceeds by the LEOs, both optimal punishment and recovering the proceeds to the victims can be pursued. But in our country, people have tendency to bring every civil case to the police or prosecutor s office. We need to limit the recoveringcriminal proceeds case. In my opinion the desirable case may be major fraud, Ponzi scheme, Pyramid scheme fraud and voice phishing by criminal organizations. Under the current circumstances, our first priority should bethe revising the current asset recovery laws, allowing the government to distribute fraud proceeds recovered from overseas to local victims."
rates and mechanisms of uranyl oxyhydroxide mineral dissolution,2017,"['Uranyl oxyhydroxides', 'Compreignacite', 'Dissolution rate', 'Reactive transport', 'EXAFS']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Uranyl oxyhydroxide minerals are important weathering products in uranium-contaminated surface and subsurface environments that regulate dissolved uranium (U) concentrations. However, dissolution rates for this class of minerals and associated dissolution mechanisms have not been previously reported for circumneutral pH conditions, particularly for the case of flow through porous media. In this work, the dissolution rates of K- and Na-compreignacite (K<SUB>2</SUB>(UO<SUB>2</SUB>)<SUB>6</SUB>O<SUB>4</SUB>(OH)<SUB>6</SUB>·8H<SUB>2</SUB>O and Na<SUB>2</SUB>(UO<SUB>2</SUB>)<SUB>6</SUB>O<SUB>4</SUB>(OH)<SUB>6</SUB>·8H<SUB>2</SUB>O, respectively) were measured using flow-through columns reacted with two simulated background porewater (BPW) solutions of low and high dissolved carbonate concentration (ca. 0.2 and 2.8mmolL<SUP>−1</SUP>). Column materials were characterized before and after reaction with electron microscopy, bulk chemistry, and EXAFS to identify structural and chemical changes during dissolution and to obtain insight into molecular-scale processes. The reactive transport code CrunchFlow was used to calculate overall dissolution rates while accounting for fluid transport and changes in mineral volume and reactive surface area, and results were compared to steady-state dissolution rate calculations. In low carbonate BPW systems, interlayer K and Na were initially leached from both minerals, and in Na-compreignacite, K and minor divalent cations from the input solution were incorporated into the mineral structure. Results of characterization analyses suggested that after reaction both K- and Na-compreignacite resembled a disordered K-compreignacite with altered surfaces. A 10-fold increase in dissolved carbonate concentration and corresponding increase in pH (from 6.65 to 8.40) resulted in a net removal of 58–87% of total U mass from the columns, compared to <1% net loss in low carbonate BPW systems. Steady-state release of dissolved U was not observed with high carbonate solutions and post-reaction characterizations indicated a lack of development of leached or altered surfaces. Dissolution rates (normalized to specific surface area) were 2.5–3 orders-of-magnitude faster in high versus low carbonate BPW systems, with Na-compreignacite dissolving more rapidly than K-compreignacite under both BPW conditions, possibly due to greater ion exchange (1.57·10<SUP>−10</SUP> vs. 1.28·10<SUP>−13</SUP> molm<SUP>−2</SUP> s<SUP>−1</SUP> [log <I>R</I> =−9.81 and −12.89] and 5.79·10<SUP>−10</SUP> vs. 3.71·10<SUP>−13</SUP> molm<SUP>−2</SUP> s<SUP>−1</SUP> [log <I>R</I> =−9.24 and −12.43] for K- and Na-compreignacite, respectively). Experimental and spectroscopic results suggest that the dissolution rate is controlled by bond breaking of a uranyl group and detachment from polyhedral layers of the mineral structure. With higher dissolved carbonate concentrations, this rate-determining step is accelerated by the formation of Ca-uranyl carbonate complexes (dominant species under these conditions), which resulted in an increase of the dissolution rates. Optimization of both dissolution rate and mineral volume fraction in the reactive transport model to account for U mass removal during dissolution more accurately reproduced effluent data in high carbonate systems, and resulted in faster overall rates compared with a steady-state dissolution assumption. This study highlights the importance of coupling reaction and transport processes during the quantification of mineral dissolution rates to accurately predict the fate of contaminants such as U in porous geomedia.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  Compreignacite dissolution rates vary with the interlayer cation (Na>K). </LI> <LI>  Detachment of uranyl groups from polyhedral layers is the rate-determining step. </LI> <LI>  I"

Word2Vec 분석에서는 기후변화의 세부현상인 온난화, 홍수, 가뭄 3개 단어와 문장 내 연관관계가 높은 단어들을 파악하여 매체 간 비교를 수행하였다. KEI 보고서는 온난화의 단기적인 영향, 온난화가 인간에 미치는 영향, 홍수의 국내 영향, 가뭄이 인간에 미치는 영향과 관계된 단어가 3개 단어와 연관성이 높은 것으로 파악되었고, 네이버 뉴스에서는 온난화의 초장기적인 영향, 온난화가 생물 및 식량에 미치는 영향, 해외 홍수의 피해, 가뭄이 농업에 미치는 영향과 관계된 단어의 연관성이 높은 것으로 파악되었다. 이러한 차이는 연구보고서가 국민의 삶에 질과 연관하여 기후변화를 연구하고 있는 데 비해, 네이버 뉴스는 기후변화로 인한 세계적인 피해를 중심으로 기사가 작성되고 있는 현상을 반영한다고 할 수 있다.이상에서 소개한 3개의 알고리듬을 2개의 텍스트 문헌에 적용한 텍스트 분석 결과로부터 환경 연구 수요 및 현재 연구 부족 분야를 파악하였다. 토픽 구성 변화를 보면, ‘에너지-자원’, ‘폐기물’, ‘유전자 변형/소음’, ‘보건/데이터’에 대한 민간의 관심이 제고되고 있는데 연구동향은 이를 담아내지 못하고 있었다. 그리고 키워드 분석의 결과를 보면 민간의 관심은 태풍, 한파, 대설 등 세분화된 기후변화 주제로 이동하고 있지만 연구동향은 기후변화 일반을 중심으로 전개되고 있었다. 따라서 환경연구의 외연을 기후변화 외부 영역으로 확장하고, 기후변화와 관계된 연구는 연구주제를 세분화하는 연구가 필요하다고 할 수 있다.환경 빅데이터 연구 인프라 구축의 일환으로 공공데이터포털(대기오염 및 기상정보), 한국환경공단 AirKorea, 기상자료개방포털 3개 웹페이지의 자료 수집 알고리듬을 개발하였다. 공공데이터포털 자료 수집 알고리듬은 공공데이터포털에서 제공하는 API 서비스를 이용하여 자료를 수집하는 알고리듬이다. 한국환경공단 AirKorea 자료 수집 알고리듬은 웹사이트에 직접 접속하여 자료를 수집하는 알고리듬이다. 이상 2개의 알고리듬은 데이터를 수집하고 추출하는 전 과정을 Python 코드로 작성하여 자동화하였다. 반면 기상자료개방포털 자료 수집 알고리듬은 셀레니움(Selenium) 프로그램을 이용하여 웹브라우저의 로그인 과정을 대행하고, 로그인 이후부터 압축파일(Zip)로 제공되는 자료를 다운로드하는 과정을 자동화한 알고리듬이다. 이 3개 알고리듬을 구축하여 자료가 직접 게시되는 경우, API를 통해 제공되는 경우, 압축파일 형태로만 제공되는 경우에 각각 대응 가능한 자료 추출 도구를 구비하였다.2017년 본 연구는 빅데이터 연구 방법론을 수치 자료에 적용하면 기존의 방법론보다 소규모 지역 단위에서 예측오차를 단축할 수 있고, 텍스트 자료에 적용하면 민간의 연구에 대한 수요(환경뉴스) 및 연구 공급 현황(연구보고서)을 비교·분석할 수 있음을 확인하였다. 본 연구가 제공하는 정교한 환경정보 예측치는 그 자체로서 민간 환경정보 서비스의 인프라로 기능할 수 있고, 단기 소규모 지역 단위 정책재원 운용의 기준으로 활용할 수 있다. 또한 의사결정나무를 이용하여 독립변수의 중요도를 파악하는 기법을 적용하면, 재정지출이 환경오염에 미치는 영향의 중요도를 평가하여 소규모 지역 단위 재정운용 성과평가 수단으로도 활용할 수 있다. 본 연구의 성과는 빅데이터 연구 방법론이 민간 환경정보사업의 인프라 구축, 정책운용의 효율성 제고, 정책평가 수단의 확충이라는 3가지 측면에서 잠재적으로 정책적 활용 가능성이 있음을 보여 주었다.본 연구의 성과는 본 연구에서 구축한 깃허브(https://github.com/keibigdata)에 공개하였으며, 향후 본 연구에서 개발하는 환경 빅데이터 분석플랫폼의 기초자료로 활용할 계획이다.","The key advantages of Machine Learning analysis using large data are 1) accurate forecast and 2) unknown-pattern finding In this report, we try to make use of these advantages in Environmental Research and Service.

a study of efficiency information filtering system using one-hot long short-term memory,2017,"['information filtering system', 'spam filtering', 'region embedding', 'term weighting.']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In this paper, we propose an extended method of one-hot Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)  and evaluate the performance on spam filtering task. Most of traditional methods proposed for spam filtering  task use word occurrences to represent spam or non-spam messages and all syntactic and semantic  information are ignored. Major issue appears when both spam and non-spam messages share many common  words and noise words. Therefore, it becomes challenging to the system to filter correct labels between  spam and non-spam. Unlike previous studies on information filtering task, instead of using only word  occurrence and word context as in probabilistic models, we apply a neural network-based approach to train the  system filter for a better performance. In addition to one-hot representation, using term weight with attention  mechanism allows classifier to focus on potential words which most likely appear in spam and non-spam  collection. As a result, we obtained some improvement over the performances of the previous methods. We  find out using region embedding and pooling features on the top of LSTM along with attention mechanism  allows system to explore a better document representation for filtering task in general."

Moreover, in order to investigate a 360-degree image on a 2D display, a user has to either click and drag the image with a mouse, or project it to a 2D panorama image, which inevitably introduces severe distortions. In consequence, investigating a 360-degree image and finding an object of interest in such a 360-degree image could be a tedious task. To resolve this issue, this paper proposes a method to find a region of interest and produces a 2D naturally looking image from a given 360-degree image that best matches a description given by a user in a natural language sentence. Our method also considers photo composition so that the resulting image is aesthetically pleasing. Our method first converts a 360-degree image to a 2D cubemap. As objects in a 360-degree image may appear distorted or split into multiple pieces in a typical cubemap, leading to failure of detection of such objects, we introduce a modified cubemap. Then our method applies a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network based object detection method to find a region of interest with a given natural language sentence. Finally, our method produces an image that contains the detected region, and also has aesthetically pleasing composition."

preliminary study of deep learning-based precipitation prediction,2017,"['Deep Learning', 'Global Navigation Satellite System', 'Precipitable Water Vapor', 'Meteorological Factors', 'Precipitation Prediction']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Recently, data analysis research has been carried out using the deep learning technique in various fields such as image interpretation and/or classification. Various types of algorithms are being developed for many applications. In this paper, we propose a precipitation prediction algorithm based on deep learning with high accuracy in order to take care of the possible severe damage caused by climate change. Since the geographical and seasonal characteristics of Korea are clearly distinct, the meteorological factors have repetitive patterns in a time series. Since the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a powerful algorithm for consecutive data, it was used to predict precipitation in this study. For the numerical test, we calculated the PWV (Precipitable Water Vapor) based on the tropospheric delay of the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) signals, and then applied the deep learning technique to the precipitation prediction. The GNSS data was processed by scientific software with the troposphere model of Saastamoinen and the Niell mapping function.

This affects investors' decisions and creates stock market volatility. This infor-mation is used as an important resource for forecasting stock market trends. At this time, there are two kinds of external information: news information and macroeconomic indicators. However, if we look at existing studies, they predicted only with news or macroe-conomic indicators. There was no study that considered all the external influences by combining news information and macroeconom-ic indicators together. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method of integrating and forecasting information with different character-istics by considering the external information affecting the stock market through the deep learning algorithm. News information was extracted from the New York Times's 2-year data using the Word2vec model. Macroeconomic indicators are based on economic theo-ries that can influence the Dow Jones Index. This is the gold price and exchange rate market. Algorithms that integrate information ex-tracted from news and macroeconomic effects together are applied to LSTM networks suitable for handling time series data and string data. As a result of experimenting with changing the forecasting period, it is better to predict the results with only simple information and the macroeconomic results than with the results from this study. In addition, the algorithm proposed in this paper is superior to the methodology used in previous research."

미국 무역정책 변화가 국내 중공업 기업의 경영성과에 미치는 영향,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Since late 2016, protectionism has been a major trend in world trade with the Great Britain exiting the European Union and the United States electing Donald Trump as the 45th president. Consequently, there has been a huge public outcry regarding the negative prospects of heavy industry firms in Korea, which are highly dependent upon international trade with Western countries including the United States. In light of such trend and concerns, we have tried to predict business performance of heavy industry firms in Korea with data regarding trade policy of the United States. United States International Trade Commission (USITC) levies countervailing duties and anti-dumping duties to firms that violate its fair-trade regulations. In this study, we have performed data analysis with past records of countervailing duties and anti-dumping duties. With results from clustering analysis, it could be concluded that trade policy trends of the Unites States significantly affects the business performance of heavy industry firms in Korea. Furthermore, we have attempted to quantify such effects by employing long short-term memory (LSTM), a popular neural networks model that is well-suited to deal with sequential data. Our major contribution is that we have succeeded in empirically validating the intuitive argument and also predicting the future trend with rigorous data mining techniques. With some improvements, our results are expected to be highly relevant to designing regulations regarding heavy industry in Korea."

engineered extracellular microenvironment with a tunable mechanical property for controlling cell behavior and cardiomyogenic fate of cardiac stem cells,2017,"['Cardiac stem cells', 'Microenvironment', 'Elastic modulus', 'Cell behavior', 'Cardiomyogenic fate']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Endogenous cardiac stem cells (CSCs) are known to play a certain role in the myocardial homeostasis of the adult heart. The extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding CSCs provides mechanical signals to regulate a variety of cell behaviors, yet the impact in the adult heart of these mechanical properties of ECM on CSC renewal and fate decisions is mostly unknown. To elucidate CSC mechanoresponses at the individual cell and myocardial level, we used the sol-to-gel transitional gelatin-poly(ethylene glycol)-tyramine (GPT) hydrogel with a tunable mechanical property to construct a three-dimensional (3D) matrix for culturing native myocardium and CSCs. The elastic modulus of the GPT hydrogel was controlled by adjusting cross-linking density using hydrogen peroxide. The GPT hydrogel showed an ability to transduce integrin-mediated signals into the myocardium and to permit myocardial homeostatic processes <I>in vitro</I>, including CSC migration and proliferation into the hydrogel from the myocardium. Decreasing the elastic modulus of the hydrogel resulted in upregulation of phosphorylated integrin-mediated signaling molecules in CSCs, which were associated with significant increases in cell spreading, migration, and proliferation of CSCs in a modulus-dependent manner. However, increasing the elastic modulus of hydrogel induced the arrest of cell growth but led to upregulation of cardiomyocyte-associated mRNAs in CSCs. This work demonstrates that tunable 3D-engineered microenvironments created by GPT hydrogel are able to control CSC behavior and to direct cardiomyogenic fate.

The maximum adsorptioncapacity of this strain calculated using the Langmuir isothermwas 60.6 mg Pb/g. In an in vivo experiment, young male micewere provided with water (A), Pb-water (B), or Pb-water+L-96 (C) during puberty. Lower glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase(GOT) and glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT)levels in Pb-exposed male mice that received strain L-96 asa probiotic were suggestive of reduced hepatotoxicity. Moreover,feces from mice treated with L-96 contained more Pbthan feces from untreated mice. Increased Pb eliminationlikely reduced internal accumulation, and this hypothesis wassupported by significantly lower Pb concentrations in kidneysand testes of the mice treated with strain L-96. The motilityand ATP content of epididymal spermatozoa were partiallyrestored if strain L-96 was administered.

A total of fifteen, 28 days old, weaned pigs were randomly distributed into three treatment groups, 5 pens per treatment (one head per pen). Each experimental diet was provided to five piglets per group (T0, 0% PAA; T1, 0.1% PAA; T2, 0.5% PAA). The feed consumption was calculated daily and body weight on a weekly basis. The blood samples were analyzed for plasma concentration of biochemical parameters and cytokines using ELISA Kit assay. Pigs fed with the 0.5% PAA have greater average daily weight gain (ADG) and feed efficiency (FE) as compared to those of T0 and T1. However, ADG and FE of T0 and T1 have no remarkable differences. The plasma cytokine levels were lower in T2 as compared to T0 and T1. The blood parameters like total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), glutamate oxalate transaminase (GOT) and glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) were within the normal range in all the treatment groups. The study indicated that supplementation of 0.5% PAA have positive effect on the growth performance of the weanling pigs. Moreover, supplementation of the amino acid isolated and purified from animal slaughter house blood has no adverse effect on palatability of the feed and health of the animals."

This study was conducted to investigate the effect of dietary supplementation of oyster mushrooms such as Pleurotus ostreatus, P. pulmonarius, and P. citrinopileatus on high cholesterol fed rats. Five-week old female Sprague-Dawley albino rats were divided into three groups of 8 rats each. Feeding a diet containing a 5% fruiting body powder of Pleurotus species to high cholesterol fed rats reduced plasma total cholesterol (TG), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Feeding each oyster mushroom also significantly reduced body weight in high cholesterol fed rats. However, it had no adverse effects on plasma albumin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, uric acid, glucose, total protein or enzyme profiles such as glutamate oxalate transaminase (GOT), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) which are related to kidney function. Feeding each mushroom increased total lipid and cholesterol excretion in feces. A histological study of hepatic cells by conventional red O staining showed normal findings in mushroom-fed hyperlipidemic rats. These results suggested that diet supplementation of 5% fruiting body power of Pleurotus species provided health benefits by acting on the atherogenic lipid profile in high cholesterol fed rats."

First, the researcher selected a sample of raised olive flounder that exhibited typical symptoms of emaciation in three aquafarms in Jeju for experimental use, and then selected healthy-looking olive flounder from one aquafarm that had no past record of emaciation disease, and checked for possibilities of infection through PCR. Averagely, in the hematological analysis shows that haematocrit (Ht), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), and glucose (GLU), emaciated fish groups (Farm A, B, and C) displayed higher experimental values than control group, and in the glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT), total cholesterol (Tchol), and total protein (TP), exhibited lower experimental values than control group. As a result of measuring lysozyme, nitro-blue-tetrazolium (NBT) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), which are markers for non-specific immune responses, lower experimental values were observed in the three experiments. Thus, it can be concluded that a high mortality rate was exhibited due to stress and internal organ damages that resulted from the destruction of the primary defense mechanism that protects fishes from getting infected by emaciation agents."

evaluating the visualization of what a deep neural network has learned,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance in complex machine learning tasks such as image classification or speech recognition. However, due to their multilayer nonlinear structure, they are not transparent, i.e., it is hard to grasp what makes them arrive at a particular classification or recognition decision, given a new unseen data sample. Recently, several approaches have been proposed enabling one to understand and interpret the reasoning embodied in a DNN for a single test image. These methods quantify the 'importance' of individual pixels with respect to the classification decision and allow a visualization in terms of a heatmap in pixel/input space. While the usefulness of heatmaps can be judged subjectively by a human, an objective quality measure is missing. In this paper, we present a general methodology based on region perturbation for evaluating ordered collections of pixels such as heatmaps. We compare heatmaps computed by three different methods on the SUN397, ILSVRC2012, and MIT Places data sets. Our main result is that the recently proposed layer-wise relevance propagation algorithm qualitatively and quantitatively provides a better explanation of what made a DNN arrive at a particular classification decision than the sensitivity-based approach or the deconvolution method. We provide theoretical arguments to explain this result and discuss its practical implications. Finally, we investigate the use of heatmaps for unsupervised assessment of the neural network performance.</P>"

In the training stage, the band-wise log spectral magnitude and unwrapped phase of both the dominant and residual signals are utilized to model the nonlinearities of each sub-band through deep architecture. From that point, stereo extension is conducted by estimating the residual signal that corresponds to the input mono channel signal with the trained DNN model in a sub-band domain. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using a log spectral distortion (LSD) measure and multiple stimuli with a hidden reference and anchor (MUSHRA) test.

social media based real-time event detection by using deep learning methods,2017,"['Social Data', 'Deep Learning', 'Convolutional Neural Network', 'Long Short Term Memory', 'Event Detection']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Event detection using social media has been widespread since social network services have been an active communication channel for connecting with others, diffusing news message. Especially, the real-time characteristic of social media has created the opportunity for supporting for real-time applications/systems. Social network such as Twitter is the potential data source to explore useful information by mining messages posted by the user community. This paper proposed a novel system for temporal event detection by analyzing social data. As a result, this information can be used by first responders, decision makers, or news agents to gain insight of the situation. The proposed approach takes advantages of deep learning methods that play core techniques on the main tasks including informative data identifying from a noisy environment and temporal event detection. The former is the responsibility of Convolutional Neural Network model trained from labeled Twitter data. The latter is for event detection supported by Recurrent Neural Network module. We demonstrated our approach and experimental results on the case study of earthquake situations. Our system is more adaptive than other systems used traditional methods since deep learning enables to extract the features of data without spending lots of time constructing feature by hand. This benefit makes our approach adaptive to extend to a new context of practice. Moreover, the proposed system promised to respond to acceptable delay within several minutes that will helpful mean for supporting news channel agents or belief plan in case of disaster events."

deep learning ensemble with asymptotic techniques for oscillometric blood pressure estimation,2017,"['Blood pressure', 'Oscillometric measurement', 'Bootstrap', 'Deep neural networks', 'Confidence interval']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Background and Objective: This paper proposes a deep learning based ensemble regression estimator with asymptotic techniques, and offers a method that can decrease uncertainty for oscillometric blood pressure (BP) measurements using the bootstrap and Monte-Carlo approach. While the former is used to estimate SBP and DBP, the latter attempts to determine confidence intervals (CIs) for SBP and DBP based on oscillometric BP measurements. Method: This work originally employs deep belief networks (DBN)-deep neural networks (DNN) to effectively estimate BPs based on oscillometric measurements. However, there are some inherent problems with these methods. First, it is not easy to determine the best DBN-DNN estimator, and worthy information might be omitted when selecting one DBN-DNN estimator and discarding the others. Additionally, our input feature vectors, obtained from only five measurements per subject, represent a very small sample size; this is a critical weakness when using the DBN-DNN technique and can cause overfitting or underfitting, depending on the structure of the algorithm. To address these problems, an ensemble with an asymptotic approach (based on combining the bootstrap with the DBN-DNN technique) is utilized to generate the pseudo features needed to estimate the SBP and DBP. In the first stage, the bootstrap-aggregation technique is used to create ensemble parameters. Afterward, the AdaBoost approach is employed for the second-stage SBP and DBP estimation. We then use the bootstrap and Monte-Carlo techniques in order to determine the CIs based on the target BP estimated using the DBN-DNN ensemble regression estimator with the asymptotic technique in the third stage. Results: The proposed method can mitigate the estimation uncertainty such as large the standard deviation of error (SDE) on comparing the proposed DBN-DNN ensemble regression estimator with the DBN-DNN single regression estimator, we identify that the SDEs of the SBP and DBP are reduced by 0.58 and 0.57@? mmHg, respectively. These indicate that the proposed method actually enhances the performance by 9.18% and 10.88% compared with the DBN-DNN single estimator. Conclusion: The proposed methodology improves the accuracy of BP estimation and reduces the uncertainty for BP estimation."

When investigating the gene-gene interactions, however, estimating the association measure for all of the possible genomic combination becomes computationally intensive rapidly as the order of interaction increases. We show first that the deep learning neural network can be used to measure the strength of the genomic association with case-control phenotype. Then we demonstrate that the selection of the interacting genotypes is possible without going through all of the interacting combinations. Instead of examining each SNP or SNP combination, as is the conventional way, we start from using all of the available SNPs as the input to the neural network. In that way, the association strength by the whole SNPs’ interaction may be obtained. Then each SNP is excluded in turn from the input and the change in accuracy is measured. A set of SNPs that could cause statistically significant change may be identified. By estimating the accuracy changes when excluding the combinations made of this set, we could successfully identify the causal combination from the used genomic data set."
a deep learning model for robust wafer fault monitoring with sensor measurement noise,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Standard fault detection and classification (FDC) models detect wafer faults by extracting features useful for fault detection from time-indexed measurements of the equipment recorded by in situ sensors (sensor signals) and feeding the extracted information into a classifier. However, the preprocessing-and-classification approach often results in the loss of information in the sensor signals that is important for detecting wafer faults. Furthermore, the sensor signals usually contain noise induced by mechanical and electrical disturbances. In this paper, we propose the use of a stacked denoising auto-encoder (SdA), which is a deep learning algorithm, to establish an FDC model for simultaneous feature extraction and classification. The SdA model can identify global and invariant features in the sensor signals for fault monitoring and is robust against measurement noise. Through experiments using wafer samples collected from a work-site photolithography tool, we confirmed that as the sensor measurement noise severity increased, the SdA's classification accuracy could be as much as 14% higher than those of the twelve models considered for comparison, each of which employed one of three feature extractors and one of four classifiers.</P>"

oscillometric blood pressure estimation based on deep learning,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Oscillometric measurement is widely used to estimate systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). In this paper, we propose a deep belief network (DBN)-deep neural network (DNN) to learn about the complex nonlinear relationship between the artificial feature vectors obtained from the oscillometric wave and the reference nurse blood pressures using the DBN-DNN-based-regression model. Our DBN-DNN is a powerful generative network for feature extraction and can address to stick in local minima through a special pretraining phase. Therefore, this model provides an alternative way for replacing a popular shallow model. Based on this, we apply the DBN-DNN-based regression model to estimate the SBP and DBP. However, there are a small amount of data samples, which is not enough to train the DBN-DNN without the overfitting problem. For this reason, we use the parametric bootstrap-based artificial features, which are used as training samples to efficiently learn the complex nonlinear functions between the feature vectors obtained and the reference nurse blood pressures. As far as we know, this is one of the first studies using the DBN-DNN-based regression model for BP estimation when a small training sample is available. Our DBN-DNN-based regression model provides a lower standard deviation of error, mean error, and mean absolute error for the SBP and DBP as compared with the conventional methods.</P>"

Therefore, in recent years, a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system has been developed for the purpose of improving the detection accuracy for early detection and reducing the burden to radiologists. In this paper, we extract the GGO using Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) based on emphasized images. Before detect a GGO region, we apply preprocessing such as isotropic voxel to the original images, and extraction of the lung area. Next, we remove the vessel and bronchial region by 3D line filter based on Hessian matrix, and extract the initial candidate regions using density gradient, volume and sphericity. Subsequently, we segment the candidate regions, extraction of features, and reducing false positive shadows. Finally we create emphasize images and identify with DCNN using those images. As a result of applying the proposed method to 31 cases on Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC), we obtained a true positive rate (TP) of 86.05 [%] and false positive number (FP) of 4.81 [/case]."

weakly supervised learning with deep convolutional neural networks for semantic segmentation: understanding semantic layout of images with minimum human supervision,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Semantic segmentation is a popular visual recognition task whose goal is to estimate pixel-level object class labels in images. This problem has been recently handled by deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), and the state-of-the-art techniques achieve impressive records on public benchmark data sets. However, learning DCNNs demand a large number of annotated training data while segmentation annotations in existing data sets are significantly limited in terms of both quantity and diversity due to the heavy annotation cost. Weakly supervised approaches tackle this issue by leveraging weak annotations such as image-level labels and bounding boxes, which are either readily available in existing large-scale data sets for image classification and object detection or easily obtained thanks to their low annotation costs. The main challenge in weakly supervised semantic segmentation then is the incomplete annotations that miss accurate object boundary information required to learn segmentation. This article provides a comprehensive overview of weakly supervised approaches for semantic segmentation. Specifically, we describe how the approaches overcome the limitations and discuss research directions worthy of investigation to improve performance.</P>"

However, it is hard to obtain a large amount of labeled data in practice and it is time-consuming with a lot of cost to obtain labels of data.Although unlabeled data is comparatively plentiful than labeled data, most of supervised learning methods are not designed to exploit unlabeled data. Self-training is one of the semisupervised learning methods that alternatively repeat training a base classifier and labeling unlabeled data in training set. Most self-training methods have adopted confidence measures to select confidently labeled examples because high-confidence usually implies low error.A major difficulty of self-training is the error amplification. If a classifier misclassifies some examples and the misclassified examples are included in the labeled training set, the next classifier may learn improper classification boundaries and generate more misclassified examples. Since base classifiers are built with small labeled dataset and are hard to earn good generalization performance due to the small labeled dataset. Although improving training procedure and the performance of classifiers, error occurrence is inevitable, so corrections of self-labeled data are necessary to avoid error amplification in the following classifiers. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network based approach for alleviating the problems of self-training by combining schemes: pre-training, dropout and error forgetting. By applying combinations of these schemes to various dataset, a trained classifier using our approach shows improved performance than trained classifier using common self-training"

the posthuman child in learning community beyond anthropocentrism- by dr. lim,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Today, my role is to communicate this deep and philosophical subject with the public in more understandable way. I may be suitable for this position because I am not an expert on this subject of post human, either. In my opinion, the one of proceeding issues, abstract formalism meant using languages to simplify the creative and organic processes of education, ultimately creating detailed formats and systems. Again evaluating the situations with the system already built and horning the system more detailed and systematic again which will suffocate the organic process of education. I think the current emphasis on the kindergarten evaluation, the accreditation process of children’s houses (day care centers), the Nuri Curriculum, the evaluation of the college of education, and the university evaluation is in the same line with abstract formalism. Everyone knows that these evaluations were tiring and difficult and not representing the real world of education, but he cannot find any other alternative and thinks this detailed evaluation system at least will not harm our education. The issue of this type is not just a situation in Korea, but a shared and sympathetic issue shared by the world recently. Through today’s lecture sessions, we have become an opportunity to feel the problems of our educational reality and think again. We have tried to solve the problem in this paradigm, despite the fact that we are aware of the problems of the abstract formalism. Our efforts have become increasingly absorbed in the formalism, and in this process, we are losing our individual agency. We need to find new perspective and paradigm.I believe that the arrival of the post human era will help us to push ourselves beyond the abstract formalism paradigm. The advent of post human make us face the sense of crisis. The abstract formalism paradigm is no longer suitable for us to survive in this coming future, pushing us for a different perspective. This crisis will provide us with an opportunity to change. To be simplistic, an emphasis should be placed on the characteristics which humans have as their own rather than abstract formalism which machine might do better.Professor Lim’s lecture showed a new perspective and framework to move forward and showed hope and possibilities. Two perspectives on post human, transhuman and critical humanism, provide good understanding of what we experience now and future. Professor Lim insists to go beyond anthrocentrism based on the reflective abilities of humanity and recover true humanism. So far, humanism has been absorbed in human superiority and has obviously been forgetting that human is a part of the larger part of the world and exploiting the earth, The most humane aspect can survive in this post human era and this is true humanism which she asks us to recover. This is the healing of humanity and the restoration of mankind. She find the example of true humanism from children and their learning and their attitude to face this world. Although it is a somewhat romantic perspective, I hope to see the bright future from this perspective."

For this reason, we propose an age estimation method using artiﬁcially generated data. Image data are artiﬁcially generated through 3D information, thus solving the problem of shortage of training data, and helping with the training of the deep-learning technique. Augmentation using 3D has advantages over 2D because it creates new images with more information. We use a deep architecture as a pre-trained model, and improve the estimation capacity using artiﬁcially augmented training images. The deep architecture can outperform traditional estimation methods, and the improved method showed increased reliability.

fully deep blind image quality predictor,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>In general, owing to the benefits obtained from original information, full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) achieves relatively higher prediction accuracy than no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA). By fully utilizing reference images, conventional FR-IQA methods have been investigated to produce objective scores that are close to subjective scores. In contrast, NR-IQA does not consider reference images; thus, its performance is inferior to that of FR-IQA. To alleviate this accuracy discrepancy between FR-IQA and NR-IQA methods, we propose a blind image evaluator based on a convolutional neural network (BIECON). To imitate FR-IQA behavior, we adopt the strong representation power of a deep convolutional neural network to generate a local quality map, similar to FR-IQA. To obtain the best results from the deep neural network, replacing hand-crafted features with automatically learned features is necessary.

To understand the students’ attitudes and depth of study using MCDs, we analyzed the results of a questionnaire in an open format about experiencing MCDs and examined the resulting products.Results: Through the responses to questionnaire, we found several favorable outcomes, major of which was deeper insight and comprehensive understanding of disease facilitated by the process of making well-organized diagram. The main disadvantages of these guidelines were the feeling of too much workload and difficulty of finding mechanisms. Students gave suggestions to overcome these problems: cautious reading of comprehensive texts, additional guidance from staff about depth and focus of mechanisms, and cooperative group work. From the analysis of maps, we recognized there should be allowance of diversities in the appearance of maps and many hypothetical connections, which could be related to an insufficient understanding of mechanisms in nature.Conclusion: The more detailed an MCD task is, the better students can become acquainted with deep knowledges. However, this advantage should be balanced by the results that there are many ensuing difficulties for the work and deliberate help plans should be prepared."

deep boltzmann regression with mimic features for oscillometric blood pressure estimation,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Oscillometric blood pressure (BP) devices are among the standard automatic monitors, now readily available for the home, office, and hospital. The systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) are obtained at fixed ratios of the envelope of the maximum amplitude of the oscillometric wave signal. However, these fixed ratios can cause overestimation or underestimation of the real SBP and DBP in oscillometric BP measurements. In this paper, we propose a new regression technique using a deep Boltzmann regression with mimic features based on the bootstrap technique to learn the complex nonlinear relationships between the mimic features vectors acquired from the oscillometric signals and the target BPs. The performance of the proposed model is compared with those of conventional and auscultatory techniques.

structured pruning of deep convolutional neural networks,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Real-time application of deep learning algorithms is often hindered by high computational complexity and frequent memory accesses. Network pruning is a promising technique to solve this problem. However, pruning usually results in irregular network connections that not only demand extra representation efforts but also do not fit well on parallel computation. We introduce structured sparsity at various scales for convolutional neural networks: feature map-wise, kernel-wise, and intra-kernel strided sparsity. This structured sparsity is very advantageous for direct computational resource savings on embedded computers, in parallel computing environments, and in hardware-based systems. To decide the importance of network connections and paths, the proposed method uses a particle filtering approach. The importance weight of each particle is assigned by assessing the misclassification rate with a corresponding connectivity pattern. The pruned network is retrained to compensate for the losses due to pruning. While implementing convolutions as matrix products, we particularly show that intra-kernel strided sparsity with a simple constraint can significantly reduce the size of the kernel and feature map tensors. The proposed work shows that when pruning granularities are applied in combination, we can prune the CIFAR-10 network by more than 70% with less than a 1% loss in accuracy.</P>"

Its theoretical background is given and validating investigation are undertaken focused on the moving vehicles and person out of vehicle in tunnel, which are the official major objects to be detected. Two scenarios are set up: (1) training and prediction in the same tunnel (2) training in a tunnel and prediction in the other tunnel. From the both cases, targeted object detection in prediction mode are achieved to detectable rate to higher than 80% in case of similar time period between training and prediction but it shows a bit low detectable rate to40% when the prediction times are far from the training time without further training taking place.

CUL에서는 자율학습에 입력으로 제공되는 심볼 집합의 크기와 중심점 결정을 위한 반복 회수 및 신호 대 잡음비가 검파 성능을 결정하며, 검파 성능은 추정된 중심점과 참조 성상점 사이의 평균 자승 오차와 비트 오류율을 통하여 평가하였다. CUL으로 검파할 때, 임의로 선택된 초기 중심점을 사용하는 경우 신호 대 잡음비가 개선되어도 비트 오류율이 개선되지 않는다는 사실을 발견하였다. 이 문제를 해결하기 위하여 QPSK 검파에 적합한 초기 중심점 선택 기법을 제안하였으며, 이를 통하여 딥 러닝 기법을 이용한 검파에서 기존의 ML 검파와 동일한 수준의 비트오류율 성능을 달성하였다.","We apply the clustering-based unsupervised learning (CUL) in deep learning field to QPSK detection. The conventional QPSK detection has been performed by maximum likelihood (ML) based on the reference symbols. On the other hand, if the CUL is used, the detection is performed with only information of the number of clusters. In the CUL, the detection performance is determined by the size of the symbol set, the number of repetitions and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The detection performance is evaluated through the mean square error between the estimated center and reference symbols and bit error rate (BER). We found that the BER is not improved even if the SNR is improved when using arbitrarily selected initial center points. To solve this problem, we propose an initial center-point selection technique suitable for the QPSK detection, and achieve BER performance equal to that of conventional ML detection."

To account for life stages (the progressive lifespan angle), domains of life (the horizontal life-wide angle), and life meanings (the axial life-deep angle), we introduce three core concepts and discuss their interrelationship. (1) Learner positions show what learners exhibit when experiencing learning events. (2) Learning management apparatuses represent all factors such as discourses, institutions and learning tools as well as the network among the factors, which engage in one s learning activities. (3) Contextual knowledge reveals what learners read into their learning activities. As to the interrelationship,  learning management apparatuses (re)produce learners through the distribution of contextual knowledge. Learner positions enable learners to create new learning management apparatus to distribute, modify, and create contextual knowledge. Contextual knowledge lays the groundwork for learning activities. These core concepts require being substantiated and embodied by a empirical case studies to derive a lifelong learning theory that can tell more about our learning lives."

The research participants were 407 students who were registered for cyber lectures through an distance lifelong education institution in South Korea. Structural equation modeling was employed to validate the proposed model. First, the result revealed that academic self-regulation and task value had a positive effect on the deep approach to learning. Second academic self-regulation and task value did not have a significant effect on the surface approach to learning. Third, the deep approach to learning and surface approach to learning had a positive effect on satisfaction. Lastly, the deep approach to learning had a positive effect on satisfaction, and surface approach to learning had a negative effect on academic achievement. This study empirically examined the relationship among academic self-regulation as student variables, the task value as teaching context variables in presage stage, the deep approach and surface approach as process variables in process stage, the satisfaction and academic achievement as product variables in product stage based on 3P model. The results provide a learning performance based model of distance lifelong education through 3P model.

Despite this attention, how students learn in the flipped learning has been minimally explored. Focusing on this gap, this study investigated students’ approach to learning in flipped learning. Students’ perception for this learning method was also scrutinized. For this purpose, the student-centered flipped learning was designed according to the nine design principles suggested by Kim et al. (2014). 34 premedical students enrolled in the interaction of human body and microorganism course participated in this study and the flipped learning was executed once a week for four weeks. To collect data, surveys for students’ perception on the flipped learning were conducted after the flipped learning and R-LPQ-2F to investigate approaches to learning and a course evaluation were also conducted before and after the flipped learning. Because students in student-centered flipped learning are required to learn by actively constructing new knowledge, it was expected that the medical students adopted deep approaches to learning. However, according to the results, there were no significant differences before and after the flipped learning in terms of students’ approaches to learning. The deep motivation, a sub-factor of the deep approach to learning, however, showed a significant increase, so it is thought that the flipped learning aroused intrinsic motivation and commitment to work. In addition, students recognized more highly interactive learning activities of the flipped learning than learning improvement in the flipped learning. They were also, in general, more satisfied with the flipped learning than the traditional teacher-oriented learning according to the course evaluation, but they showed significant higher preference toward the teacher-oriented learning than the flipped learning. The explanations for reasons why deep approaches to learning did not increase during the flipped learning were discussed."

A total of 203 students from three universities located in Seoul and Kyung-Ki participated in the study. The results of a correlational analysis showed that while students with reproductive conceptions of learning tend to use a surface approach to learning, students with reconstructive conceptions of learning tend to use a deep approach to learning. Students using a strategic approach to studying tend to have both of reproductive and reconstructive conceptions of learning. Conceptions of learning were not correlated with academic achievement but significantly correlated with creative competencies. As with approaches to learning, deep approaches and strategic approaches were correlated with creative competencies as well as academic achievement. The results of regression analyses showed that after controling for sex and grade levels, surface approaches negatively predicted college course achievement while strategic approaches were a positive predictor. As with creative competencies, deep approaches positively predicted creative competencies in cognitive and affective domains.

Thus, “keywords” scanned from the vast SED-oriented conversational patterns could be algorithmized by using “deep learning.” It can, then, be clustered to build data sets. The possible domains of such mental “telepathy” may encompass algorithms that provide examples of non-logical mental representation, algorithms that provide metaphorical examples and algorithms that provide conversation topics (Hwadu).

The results of the analysis are summarized as follows; The effects of learning approach tendency (surface learning approach, deep learning approach) on the learning performance (learning satisfaction, learning effect, employment effect) of online education showed that the higher the deep learning approach tendency, the higher the learning performance of online education. On the other hand, the surface approach learning tendency did not have a significant effect on the learning performance of online education. This study suggests that online education is not only a useful learning tool for deep learning approach tendency learners with intrinsic learning motivation, but also it can be useful learning tool too to other learners if they are appropriately allocated to offline education according to lecture level and learner characteristics."

Deep Learning which represented as DNN has been applied very successfully in various applications. However, many issues in DNN have been identified through past researches. Among these issues, generalization is the most well-known problem. A Recent study, Dropout, successfully addressed this problem. Also, Dropout plays a role as noise, and so it helps to learn robust feature during learning in DNN such as Denoising AutoEncoder. However, because of a large computations required in Dropout, training takes a lot of time. Since Dropout keeps changing an inter-layer representation during the training session, the learning rates should be small, which makes training time longer. In this paper, using mutation operation, we reduce computation and improve generalization performance compared with Dropout. Also, we experimented proposed method to compare with Dropout method and showed that our method is superior to the Dropout one."

The study also aims to provide strategic implications for forum organizers and give them suggestions on how to set up target audience, manage forum contents, speakers, and services, improve attendee satisfaction, and ultimately maximize overall outcomes. As exchanges among individuals, enterprises, and organizations, as well as countries are growing rapidly, the convention industry has become a key player in the market. Conventions have also become a venue for people to discuss a specific agenda or topic, exchange information and learn knowledge and insights. Especially, the forum - as part of the convention industry - plays a vital role providing educational and social learning opportunities as scholars and expertise come together to share their knowledge and experience through a variety of discussions. With its role, many of forums are taking place in recent years; however, there have been few empirical studies upon the forum itself. Also, there have been few attempts to research how the quality of forums affect participants` satisfaction along with their characteristics and how much of practical knowledge is provided throughout the events. This study is meaningful in that it is the first practical study that takes a deep understanding of the forum and sees how the quality of the forums influences participants` satisfaction and whether the characteristics of participants have a moderating effect in increasing the level of satisfaction. Forum organizers could also take a strategic approach as their major concerns are to increase the number of participants and raise degree of satisfaction by providing significant information. There are four key elements that determine success or failure of a social learning forum. The four elements are contents, speakers, services, and participants. Content plays an important role in providing rich information and knowledge for participants. Speakers are the main knowledge providers who contribute to the forum`s social learning role. Also, the services provided by forum organizers such as simultaneous interpretation services, program brochures, lunch and refreshments, and the overall design of event hall can also influence the level of participants` satisfaction. Lastly, the participants and their characteristics are important since they are the ones who receive knowledge from the providers. The results of this study show that the quality of forum (content, speaker, and services) has a decisive effect on the participants` satisfaction and there are some differences in expectation among the participants in the forum. Also, some groups of participants were more likely to be stimulated by the quality of forum when determining their satisfaction. The study is modeled after MBN Y Forum 2016 and its participants` characteristics. The forum is one of the most representative social learning forums of South Korea and its audiences are mostly young people. It has analyzed how the participants` characteristics influence their satisfaction by grouping them into △participants who have invited for free and those who paid for the entrance fee, △first-time participants and returning participants, △voluntary and involuntary participants, △participants who registered through web and those who did through mobile, and △participants who registered during pre-sale opens and those who registered during general opens."

This consciousness is based on the two dimensions of `understanding` and `expression` in which learners acquire and extract grammatical knowledge, and it can be said to be the focus of the `expression dimension.` That is to say, while previous studies have paid attention to learner`s misconceptions in the dimension of `understanding grammar knowledge,` this study has focused on the issue of learner`s conceptualization process in the `expression dimension of grammar knowledge.` In other words, this study attempted to employ as the subjects of the study those learners who have established the grammatical concept properly by passing the level of misconceptions in grammar learning that cannot express properly. On the subjects of secondary pre-service Korean language teachers, who are most suitable for this learner type as the study subjects, this study attempted to mainly focus on exploring the issues such as how to characterize the contours of `grammatical concepts or terms` and `linguistic phenomena,` and how to conceptualize the object by adjusting the perspective to a certain extent in their acquisition of grammatical meaning, how to arrange concepts, and whether to show proper way of structuring the conceptualization process of concept speakers as to `grammatical concepts and terminology` and the `linguistic phenomena` in their conceptualization process on the subject. For this, in chapter 3, this study presented some cases of analysis of conceptualization of `word class conversion` by classifying the grammar conceptualization process of secondary pre -service Korean language teachers into convergence and divergence, to explore the possibility of analyzing the aspects, suggesting that there is a need to pay attention to the issue of learner`s conceptualization aspects.

The process of discovering a new cause is called creative or creative reason. What is needed at this time is prior knowledge. If there is prior knowledge, there is no great difficulty in creating creative knowledge. Here is the intention of the writer to provide a lecture in the course of teaching learners to write. Theory is a text with a trace structure that can be easily read and understood by learners. In addition, it can induce correct thinking and deep thinking through the theory. The writer gave to the learners Lee Kyu-bo s  Geotosilseol  and  Yiokseol  as reading materials. After reading the material, the learner was asked to write in writing without being bound to quantity. At this time, the direction of the article was designated as  reflex enlightenment . This is because the learners may not know what to write if they do not give specific directions. As a result of analyzing the submissions, the learners showed meaningful writing results to discover the reason in various incidents. If it were not for the writing task, the feedback that it was meaninglessly passed or the fact that it could be understood that it contained meaning in a minor case also disproved the effect of reading the theory of the case and structure of meaning. College writing education aimed at learners with poor writing skills should be done in an easier way. College writing is not only a mandatory course that must be taken, but it is also necessary to eliminate the fear of writing in order to be enjoyable. To eliminate fear, you must make sure that writing is easy. This point is the utility of the reading material ‘seol’."

There has been the merging of technology and arts for years; however, unlike A.I, machines have not had creative art performance ability as human have, but have only been used as a mechanical method of arts.  A.I. field now is not only used as simple mechanical methods, but has also invaded the arts area that needs creativity which had been only for human distinction, and the controversy over creativity of A.I. is ongoing.   However, in the distinct fields of academic research, getting rid of the barrier between academic fields and converging the scientific technology of A.I and art creation activities so that through the collaboration between science and arts, their collective growth is promoted and a new paradigm in the art field is created will be of great significance.  This research intends to find out how creativity known as an exclusive human ability and area is connected to A.I. and what technics have developed A.I. in the creativity-demanded arts field. Moreover, this research aims to be used to shape new direction of artistic development as reviewing the characteristics of arts applied A.I. and to contribute towards the A.I. arts sphere under the unpredictable current situation. The research methods are composed of the following order.  First of all, the necessity and the purpose of the research based on research background is set and specific research methods is drawn.  Secondly, the research finds out the definition and history of A.I. and describes deep learning of the A.I. core technology based on big data.  Third, case study on the field of literature, music, and fine arts that actively develop A.I. technics among A.I. art fields are selected and then through a case analysis study of the convergence between A.I and art, the current situation of A.I. artistic creation described.  Fourth, characteristics of expression of A.I. based on case studies of A.I. artistic creation field is deducted.  With respect to the results, characteristics of expression of A.I. arts are; creativity that creates new things that never existed based on learning data, pleasure that is felt through aesthetic works, convenience related to labour solutions during the creating process, and variability that changes from one to a total different work by simple technical operation or programming changes of new machine learning.  In conclusion, the creativity of current A.I. does not create new things but rather recreate existing work via machine learning from already given data. To sum up, for now, the field of artistic creation of A.I. cannot replace human ability like creation, instinct, judgement, etc.; however, technical development of A.I. artistic creation is a big result to predict future possibility.  In the fourth industrial revolution in which IT (information Technology) quickly moves to DT (Date Technology), A.I. technical development will contribute to improve our quality of lives due to increasing service industry and labor values. It will also help to inspire new creation in the art field. This paper is expected to help the culture-art field that consistently needs A.I creativity."

It also analyzes the case study in which it was applied to the <Thinking and Expression 2> class of Korea university. For this goal, this research focused on the concept of ‘Gruppenpuzzle,’ a newly coined term for Jigsaw from Germany which is an American model for cooperative education. In the German educational environment, the word ‘Gruppenpuzzle’ is used instead of the American term to help the students familiarize to the educational processes easier. Therefore, this study explores the German literature instead of American one in order to analyze the theoretical background and educational efforts of cooperative learning. This not only provides an opportunity to look closely at the development process of cooperative learning in Germany during the similar period of that in Korea but also contributes to expanding the basis for domestic research on cooperative learning. Ultimately, group puzzles can help build creative and convergence-based thinking in learners by enabling them to experience deep and rich thinking through cooperation with other learners, rather than to passively accept information and knowledge. Such learning methods are also valuable as an instructional method to train social skills to coexist with others in this fast-changing society. Above all, the case study on the <Thinking and Expression II> class of Korea university which applies group puzzles demonstrates a positive result in which group puzzles change the students’ attitude from negative to positive, boost motivation for learning by assigning responsibility and effectively forming a process-valued class based on presentation and writing.Key Words: liberal education, cooperative learning, learner-based, group puzzles(Gruppenpuzzel), positive reliability, responsibility, thinking and expression, 5-finger feedback"

This possibility helps better understand the cognitive behavior of humans in real life as well as build human-aware intelligent agents for practical purposes. However, modeling the human cognitive activity from wearable-sensor data stream is challenging because learning new information often results in loss of previously acquired information, causing a problem known as catastrophic forgetting. Here we propose a deep-learning neural network architecture that resolves the catastrophic forgetting problem. Based on the neurocognitive theory of the complementary learning systems of the neocortex and hippocampus, we introduce a dual memory architecture (DMA) that, on one hand, slowly acquires the structured knowledge representations and, on the other hand, rapidly learns the specifics of individual experiences. The DMA system learns continuously through incremental feature adaptation and weight transfer. We evaluate the performance on two real-life datasets, the CIFAR-10 image-stream dataset and the 46-day Lifelog dataset collected from Google Glass, showing that the proposed model outperforms other online learning methods.</P>"

Among them, the frequency of examination using computed tomography(CT) has been increasing because of this technique’s fast examination time and high diagnostic power. However, although the criteria for screening have been presented based on many previous studies on the CT exposure dose for adults, the criteria for children remain inadequate. Especially, relaxing the conditions to reduce the exposure dose of CT will lead to generation of noises. To address this problem, many noise removal algorithms have been developed. Among developed algorithms, a particularly strong interest has been focused on deep learning methods, which are a sort of artificial intelligence (AI)-based machine learning. Therefore, the present study aimed to develop a noise removal algorithm using the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), an AIbased deep learning method, and to apply the algorithm to pediatric abdominal CT so that to evaluate the usefulness of the approach. PMMA phantoms with different diameters of 12, 16, 20, 24, and 32 cm, which can express pediatric abdomen, were manufactured and used. To evaluate dose and image quality, the tube current was fixed to 200 mAs and the tube voltage was changed from 80 to 120, and 140 kVp; thereafter, the tube voltage was fixed to 120 kVp and the tube currents were changed from 50 to 100, 150, 200, and 250 mAs. According to the results, CTDIw showed a tendency to increase alongside with increases in the tube voltage and the tube currents, while noise decreased proportionally. In addition, the contrast decreased as the tube voltage increased, but was shown to be almost unrelated to the tube currents. Finally, the excellent CNRD result was measured in lowest exposure condition at 80 kVp and 50 mAs. Also, the average of CNRD with AI noise reduction algorithm was 1.6-4.2 times higher than before the application. In conclusion, the doses and characteristics of the pediatric abdominal CT scan according to various image acquisition conditions could be successfully identified and the efficiency of the AI noise removal algorithm developed in the present study was demonstrated."

However, all the existing methods, including deep learning-based ones, have a critical limitation in that they can only detect stego images that are created by a specific steganography method. In this paper, we propose a generalized steganalysis method that can model multiple types of stego images using deep learning.

Under the current Korean Copyright Act, artificial intelligences are not natural or legal persons, who can create works. Also, artificial intelligences cannot be a copyright holders under the current Korean Copyright Act as well as the works subject re written by artificial intelligences is only artificial intelligences, because the interventions of artificial intelligences‘s users are minimized. I think that works of artificial intelligences cannot be copyrighted works and also artificial intelligence cannot be the copyright holders at all under the current Korean Copyright Act. In addition, it has to consider, whether the works of artificial intelligence can be the database under the current Korean Copyright Act. In this article, it is researched how could be protected the works of artificial intelligences under the Copyright Act and also it is reviewed international trends about that. Through this, it is intended to arrive at a conclusion about the improvement to legal system of artificial intelligence works, etc."

Although there have been various overtures and studies to predict the price of stocks scientifically, it is impossible to predict the future precisely. However, stock price predictions have been a subject of interest in a variety of related fields such as economics, mathematics, physics, and computer science. In this paper, we will study fluctuation patterns of stock prices and predict future trends using the Deep learning. Therefore, this study presents the three deep learning models using Tensorflow, an open source framework in which each learning model accepts different input features. We expand the previous study that used simple price data. We measured the performance of three predictive models increasing the number of priced-based input features. Through this experiment, we measured the performance change of the predictive model depending on the price-based input features. Finally, we compared and analyzed the experiment result to evaluate the impact of the price-based input features in stock price prediction."

They have several features in common: both published controversial works, Uisanmundap (醫山問答, Catechism of Uisan Mountain) and Kyoi no gen (狂醫之言, Words of a Crazy Doctor), respectively; both provoked controversy among conservative intellectuals; and neither attracted much attention until the late 19th century, when their writings were employed to stress the importance of science and `practical learning`. There were also some marked differences, however. Hong had a deep understanding of Neo- Confucianism as he was of noble birth, and he was influenced by Western Learning (西學) via China. After breaking away from the Hua-Yi distinction, he inclined toward a relativist view emphasizing the current state of affairs. Sugita Genpaku, by contrast, was a medical doctor who translated a Dutch anatomy book, and he came to understand the limits of traditional knowledge through the dissection of a human body. He thus emphasized the principle that verifiable knowledge could only be obtained empirically. The difference between these two authors is a touchstone which usefully symbolizes the distinction between the Korean and Japanese approaches to the realm of ideas in the 19th century. In Korea, universal philosophical discourses still prevailed, with relatively little attention given to specialist skills or to languages. In Japan, by contrast, a wide variety of disciplines were studied and practical learning was enthusiastically developed, leading ultimately to a technological civilization."

The purpose of the study is to clarify the significance of learner reflection activity by grasping various aspects such as how the activity is perceived and performed, for what purpose, and the nature of the achievement in each class. First, I present the outline of the 16 articles to be analyzed, following which summarize “with whom,” “about what,” “how,” and “when” the learner reflection activities were performed in each class. In addition, two aspects of learner reflection activities were derived on the basis of their purpose and achievement, which were due to the following functions of reflection. The main functions of learner reflection were found to: (a) to facilitate the improvement of self-learning ability and task performance skill and (b) to enable an understanding of the meaning and value of learning activity processes and results. Moreover, I point out that reflection is not only a fundamental learning way, it is also a competency that can be acquired and cultivated. Finally, I emphasize that learner reflection activity should lead to meaningful learning in terms of self-objectification, externalization, and deep learning. As such, teachers’ support in building and scaffolding reflection is essential. These findings suggest that it enables teachers to resolve their concerns regarding the activity itself becoming hollow and the meaning around which learner reflection activity is conducted. Furthermore, sharing this study with reflective practitioners who are faced with problems surrounding learner reflection activity in educational contexts might help provide clues regarding design and practice."

Recently, many attempts have been made to predict the stock index using various machine learning methods including Deep Learning. Although the fundamental analysis and the technical analysis method are used for the analysis of the traditional stock investment transaction, the technical analysis method is more useful for the application of the short-term transaction prediction or statistical and mathematical techniques. Most of the studies that have been conducted using these technical indicators have studied the model of predicting stock prices by binary classification - rising or falling - of stock market fluctuations in the future market (usually next trading day). However, it is also true that this binary classification has many unfavorable aspects in predicting trends, identifying trading signals, or signaling portfolio rebalancing.  In this study, we try to predict the stock index by expanding the stock index trend (upward trend, boxed, downward trend) to the multiple classification system in the existing binary index method. In order to solve this multi-classification problem, a technique such as Multinomial Logistic Regression Analysis (MLOGIT), Multiple Discriminant Analysis (MDA) or Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) we propose an optimization model using Genetic Algorithm as a wrapper for improving the performance of this model using Multi-classification Support Vector Machines (MSVM), which has proved to be superior in prediction performance. In particular, the proposed model named GA-MSVM is designed to maximize model performance by optimizing not only the kernel function parameters of MSVM, but also the optimal selection of input variables (feature selection) as well as instance selection. In order to verify the performance of the proposed model, we applied the proposed method to the real data. The results show that the proposed method is more effective than the conventional multivariate SVM, which has been known to show the best prediction performance up to now, as well as existing artificial intelligence / data mining techniques such as MDA, MLOGIT, CBR, and it is confirmed that the prediction performance is better than this. Especially, it has been confirmed that the ‘instance selection’ plays a very important role in predicting the stock index trend, and it is confirmed that the improvement effect of the model is more important than other factors.  To verify the usefulness of GA-MSVM, we applied it to Korea’s real KOSPI200 stock index trend forecast. Our research is primarily aimed at predicting trend segments to capture signal acquisition or short-term trend transition points. The experimental data set includes technical indicators such as the price and volatility index (2004 ~ 2017) and macroeconomic data (interest rate, exchange rate, S&P 500, etc.) of KOSPI200 stock index in Korea. Using a variety of statistical methods including one-way ANOVA and stepwise MDA, 15 indicators were selected as candidate independent variables. The dependent variable, trend classification, was classified into three states: 1 (upward trend), 0 (boxed), and -1 (downward trend). 70% of the total data for each class was used for training and the remaining 30% was used for verifying. To verify the performance of the proposed model, several comparative model experiments such as MDA, MLOGIT, CBR, ANN and MSVM were conducted. MSVM has adopted the One-Against-One (OAO) approach, which is known as the most accurate approach among the various MSVM approaches. Although there are some limitations, the final experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model, GA-MSVM, performs at a significantly higher level than all comparative models."

In the ‘integrated writing’ seminar at Kyonggi University, we focus on creativity and on finding the practical implications of various social phenomena. This lesson, as the essay puts forward, is intended to support the students’ thinking competence, their ability to analyze problems and find creative solutions. Also through ‘critical thinking’ and the ‘enhancement of argumentation skill’, we aim to achieve the ultimate goal of university writing education: ‘broad and deep learning’."
limitations of machine translation : focused on the role of cognitive complements in human communication,2017,"['기계번역', '자동통역', '자연어처리', '언어외적 맥락', '인지적 보완소', 'machine translation MT', 'automated interpreting', 'natural language processing NLP', 'extra-linguistic context', 'cognitive complements']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Significant progress has been made in machine translation since the introduction of the Neural-based Machine Translation (NMT) algorithms. For Korean-English translation, there is growing evidence that the machine translation engines are rendering more and more acceptable translations with time through deep learning. The progress inevitably raises the question of whether human expertise will eventually be replaced by machines. This question depends on whether and how much of the inter-lingual mediation process depends on inherently human capabilities. To understand the potential boundaries of machines translation, this study draws on the role of cognitive complements in face-to-face communication, focusing on spoken as opposed to the commonly researched written texts. The first part of the study discusses the role of cognitive complements in human communication. Then to illustrate the important role played by cognitive complements in human communication, the second part of the study explains the errors made by NMT from the perspective of cognitive complements, based on a sample text analysis using Google Translate. The analysis indicate that applying the current engine to face-to-face encounters has serious pragmatic risks. From the perspective of machine translation, therefore, the ability to apply cognitive complements like human beings, with the ability to draw on extra-linguistic context may be the key to making NMT ready for real-world applications as far as the processing of spoken texts is concerned. While effort is underway to relate sensory experience to text processing, enormous computing power requirement may be another obstacle before human interpreters can be replaced completely. Pedagogic implications of this study for post-graduate interpreting programs are discussed in the final part of the paper."
segregated cell populations enable distinct parallel encoding within the radial axis of the ca1 pyramidal layer,2017,"['Hippocampus', 'CA1', 'pyramidal cell layer', 'Memory', 'place cell']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Numerous studies have implicated the hippocampus in the encoding and storage of declarative and spatial memories. Several models have considered the hippocampus and its distinct subfields to contain homogeneous pyramidal cell populations. Yet, recent studies have led to a consensus that the dorso-ventral and proximo-distal axes have different connectivities and physiologies. The remaining deep-superficial axis of the pyramidal layer, however, remains relatively unexplored due to a lack of techniques that can record from neurons simultaneously at different depths. Recent advances in transgenic mice, two-photon imaging and dense multisite recording have revealed extensive disparities between the pyramidal cells located in the deep and the superficial layers. Here, we summarize differences between the two populations in terms of gene expression and connectivity with other intra-hippocampal subregions and local interneurons that underlie distinct learning processes and spatial representations. A unified picture will emerge to describe how such local segregations can increase the capacity of the hippocampus to compute and process numerous tasks in parallel."

Specifically, the policy is detrimental to the diversity of liberal democracy, is against the Codification of the Education System, and violates the Principle of the Prohibition of the Unlawfully Broad Delegation of Legislative Powers. In addition, the policy not only goes against the pedagogical autonomy, professionalism and political neutrality of education, but also conflicts with fundamental rights such as freedom of conscience, academic freedom, freedom of expression (the right to know), and the right to learn. Thus, I think it is appropriate for the policy to be completely withdrawn and abolished since it is considerably unconstitutional as reviewed. In addition to the academic conclusion of this research, a lot of Korean people also have expressed a deep concern and strong opposition to the governmental policy for the standardization of Korean history textbooks. The South Korean Ministry of Education announced a plan to use the government-made textbook in conjunction with government-approved textbooks in schools on December 27th of last year as a result of public pressure. However, through the operation of research schools for the use of the government-made textbook and tighter screening standards for government-approved textbooks, the Ministry is making it clear that it will not abandon the policy in any manner. Edward Hallet Carr, who is a renowned historian and a political scientist from England, has remarked that “it is a continuous process of interaction between the historian and his facts, an unending dialogue between the present and the past.” in his book entitled “What Is History?” It means that history has the open possibility to be interpreted differently according to the viewpoint of the historian and that the interpretation has its own value as long as it is persuasive. The Constitutional Court of South Korea, fully recognizing the nature of history and courses pertaining to the subject, has also stated that it is desirable to introduce diverse academic opinions, various viewpoints and angles in Korean history textbooks. Fully considering the characteristics of history as a subject, we can clearly see that the policy for standardizing Korean history textbooks is never a desirable one for textbook compilation. Therefore, I think this governmental policy, which is not only unconstitutional but also does not consider the inherent characteristics of the subject, should be withdrawn and abolished completely."

Therefore, massive amounts of astronomical, accelerator, and simulation data are required to study dark matter, and efficient processing of these data is vital. Computational science, which can combine experiments, theory, and simulation, is thus necessary for dark matter research.

For this purpose, in-depth interviews and participation observation were conducted from October 2016 to April 2017, leading to the following conclusion: First, the women found it necessary to attend school conferences, to change visa status, to maintain occupation, and to continue taking part in social activities so that they can avoid deep concern over unfamiliar education environment, expensive private lessons or children s identity crisis. Second, children s education program run by the self-help group activities have been successfully carried out so as to enable them to understand a variety of cultures and to build sympathy and positive relationship between parents and children. Third, the self-help group has brought the parents a new perspective on children s education, Korean way of education, role of parents, new idea to collaborate for better education of their children, and need to establish a right educational philosophy for them to become good parents. Children also became familiar with their mom s culture, confirming their identity and strengthening their ties with peer group, and self-confident with more positive attitude toward learning. Fourth, self-help group provided not only spiritual healing, support and encouragement among members, but also made a platform for communication among members for their children s education. That is, the group offered information exchange opportunity, psychological or emotional security enough to have the women settle down peacefully in Korean society. Future research, bases upon the current research outcome, may be expanded to other nationalities than Korea-Chinese or in-depth research on operation system and scheme to improve existing system of the group meeting."

The four topics of the present conditions and task of Chinese character education which is suggested in this study is as below; 1) Studies on Chinese character education need to reflect the demands of future society. The philosophy and identity about the Chinese character education are needed to establish through core competences. 2) Chinese character education needs to consider the literacy development levels. A objective and valid development index has to be set by inducing literate features on the Chinese character learning. 3) Chinese character education is needed to be a teaching act based on EBI(Evidence Based Instruction). Chinese character education has to take the reliable authority through the process of objective and valid studies(designing, verifying, and drawing a conclusion). 4) The spectrum of semantic studies is needed to be expanded.

As the situation turned in UN's favor after the success of the Incheon Landing Operation, Kim Il-Sung emergently requested for help to Stalin and China on October 1. Despite numerous difficulties faced in the early days of the founding, China decided to participate in the Korean war on October 18.But It was not until December 8 that the North Korea-PRC CFC was established. The causes of delay are as followed: Kim Il Sung's deep-rooted historical distrust of China was formed during the anti-Japanese partisan activities, the fear of losing operational command authority and the pro-China faction seizing the power, the Soviet Union's influence retention policy towards the NK, the NK's lean-to-one-side policy toward the Soviet Union which resulted in the conflict between Sino-the Soviet Union, and so on.These discords regarding CFC worsened Sino-NK relationship, and the North Korean forces played an ancillary role of second front line in the rear of the UN forces. Ironically, although he lost his military command, Kim Il Sung could build an authoritarian regime through removing the opponents.Through the study on the conflict between the NK and PRC, we have to learn several lessons in designing public policies. First of all, We should construct strong military power, and make use of Sino-NK's fundamental gap caused by different priorities in national interests. Finally, we should prioritize ROK-US alliance over ROK-China strategic partnership relationship and maximize our national interests."

For this reason, to investigate this period s study structure clearly, this thesis researched the position of literature and suggestion on study of Kim Ahn-ro(金安老) as a representative of early16th century s bureaucrat writers.With his educational background, Kim Ahn-ro insisted a study emphasizing both inner development and literature(經文竝行). But his theory was resisted by the new scholar s opinion that put more value on moral philosophy(道學). In awareness of crisis about possibility to lose his academic status, Kim Ahn-ro put stress on literature powerfully byemphasizing literature s practical utility.In this point of view, he suggested recovery of a principle of honoring writers and reinforcement of a national school. Although his effort was failed because of the new academic trend s power, it shows Kim Ahn-ro s target consciousness to succeed traditional values of Seongjong period(成宗代) and his firm bureaucratic position as a leader of politics and literary world.In conclusion, Kim Ahn-ro was a core bureaucrat writer who pursued both inner development and literature with a steady view of learning. These aspects show that there were complex elements like educational background,learning logic and reality conditions make this period explain hard, in spite of the vivid opposition between the school of literature(詞章派) and moral philosophy(道學派). On this account, to describe this period more plentiful,we should have a new understanding of the school of literature(詞章派) with a more deep and wide vision."

For independent interpretation of poetry, this teaching-learning process focuses on the process of ‘story making’ by five W’s and one H. And its principal purpose is to make students interpret each poem for themselves guided by the questions of a teacher. Especially, it tries to overcome decreasing role of a teacher under the increasing importance of students’ participation in the class. And it is designed based on the criticism that teaching-learning processes of a literature class has been developed concentrating on reading activities. After making students interpret poetry primarily by the process of ‘story making,’ teachers lead them to accept poetic images and expressions related to its theme. Therefore, students can know that literary techniques are not just a theory but they are organically related to form a theme of poetry and thus they can experience their use and meaning. This experience is regarded as useful for students to understand the formation of poetry. Research on independent interpretation of poetry, literary techniques and themes results in aesthetic experiences which can make students feel the poetic emotions and be moved by them. The essential purpose of aesthetic experiences, which is different from other learning purposes of a Korean language class, is to get an artistic impression. Nonetheless, these experiences tend to be neglected during the class partly because they are possible only when teachers’ deep understanding and sympathy on poetry is successfully delivered to their students. However, a lot of interests and research from teachers should be needed because aesthetic experiences are the ultimate aim of literature classes including poetry. Introduction of this teaching-learning process aims at the materialization of actual classes and application based on it. However, research on teaching-learning process, sharing of experiences, etc. cannot help but have essential limitations. Because even if a certain model is applied to actual classes, teaching- learning method of each class should be adjusted each time according to the plan of a teacher, personality and ability of the teacher, the condition of students, etc. Therefore, it can be defined as the reality of professionality of a teacher."

"modelling the relationship among prior english level, self-efficacy, critical thinking, and strategies in reading performance",2017,"['self-efficacy', 'memory strategy', 'cognitive strategy', 'metacognitive strategy', 'critical thinking']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Considerable evidence indicates that self-efficacy, self-regulated learning, and academic performance  are related. However, insufficient research has investigated the relationship between self-efficacy and different types of learning strategies (deep and surface processing strategies), as well as their  influence on reading in EFL contexts. This study aims to investigate the effect of students’ prior English proficiency on current English reading performance in school through the mediation of self-efficacy, critical  thinking, and three types of language learning strategies. Moderation effects of gender and subject  specialization were also examined. A large-scale questionnaire was distributed to 780 senior high school students in Taiwan. The findings from structural equation modelling showed that students’ prior English level had a significant, direct impact on current English reading performance without a mediator, and significant, indirect effects on current English reading performance via the mediation of self-efficacy, critical thinking, and learning strategies. Deep processing involving critical thinking and metacognition are found to be positively related to surface processing strategies in English reading. Finally, these results suggest the generality of the overall model between males and females as well as between EFL high school students specializing in social science and science in Taiwan."

The proposed LKDeep is a pragmatic hybrid approach which tracks multiple objects (humans) mainly based on LK features but is compensated by detection on periodic times or on necessity times. Compared to other state-of-the-art multiple object tracking methods based on 'Tracking-By-Detection (TBD)' approach, the proposed LKDeep is faster since it does not have to detect object on every frame and it utilizes simple association rule, but it shows a good object tracking performance. Through experiments in comparison with other multiple object tracking (MOT) methods using the public DPM detector among online state-of-the-art MOT methods reported in MOT challenge [1], it is shown that the proposed simple online MOT method, LKDeep runs faster but with good tracking performance for surveillance purpose.

NMT의 작동 과정에서 신경망이 학습하는 모범 번역은 인간이 투입한다. 그리고 정확한 원문의 입력도 중요한 요소가 된다. 기계번역을 통해 우수한 품질의 결과물을 생산하기 위해서는 번역자가 정확한 원문을 입력하고, 번역물을 수정할 수 있어야 한다. 특히 한영 번역의 경우 원문의 정확도는 번역물 품질에 주요 변수가 된다. 틀린 맞춤법이나 구문, 비문 등이 포함된 원천 텍스트를 입력하면 당연히 오류의 확률이 더 높아진다. 자연언어처리에서 원천 언어의 특징도 주요 변수가 된다. 예를 들면 원천 언어가 한국어인 경우, 조사의 사용이나 언어사용 환경에 따라 번역 오류가 발생할 수 있다.이런 상황을 고려해 볼 때 기계번역의 오류 유형을 제시하고, 원천 텍스트와의 관련성을 고찰하는 연구가 필요하고, 이는 인문학 분야에서 수행되는 것이 바람직하다. 원문의 검토가 사전 처리 과정이라면 기계번역의 결과물을 평가하고, 품질을 개선하는 방안을 제시하는 것은 후처리 과정이 된다.이 연구에서는 한영 기계번역에서 인간의 사전 처리와 후처리 문제를 살펴본다. 연구의 목적은 원천 텍스트의 정확도와 연계해서 오류를 항목별로 분석함으로써 기계번역의 오류 문제에 접근하는 방식을 제시하고 오류를 줄이는 방안을 논의하는 데 있다.","Over the past few years, the technology of machine translation has made remarkable progress from Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) to Neural Machine Translation (NMT). With the introduction of deep learning, the study of machine translation has been performed mainly in the field of computer engineering, which develops systems and algorithms for artificial intelligence. However, the quality and quantity of parallel corpus composed of human translation has a decisive influence on the quality of NMT. In the process of NMT, the model translation that neural network learns is input by human. Also, input of source text is an important factor. The translator must be able to input the correct original text and modify the translation to get excellent quality results in machine translation. Especially, in the case of Korean-English translation, the accuracy of the original text is the main variable for the translation quality. To reduce errors, the translator must enter the correct source text. Inputting source text that contains incorrect spelling, imprecise phrases, and non-grammatical sentences will, of course, increase the probability of error. In the natural language processing, the characteristics of the source language are also the main variables. For example, if the source language is Korean, translation errors may occur depending on the use of the postposition or contextual situation. Given this situation, the accuracy of the source text becomes a major factor in the quality of translation. While the review and revision of the original text is a preprocessing process, evaluating the results of the machine translation and suggesting ways to improve the quality is a postprocessing process.Considering this situation, it is necessary to study the relation between the source text and the error type of machine translation, and it is desirable to perform it in the field of humanities.In this study, we examine human preprocessing and postprocessing issues in Korean-English machine translation. The purpose of this study is to present the error problem of machine translation by analyzing the error in line with the accuracy of the source text, and discussing ways to reduce translation errors."

In order to study the forced state, deformation regularity and thermal hysteresis of PDM motor, the paper established the three-dimensional thermal-mechanical coupled Finite element model (FEM). Based on the theoretical research, experimental study and numerical simulation, the study found that the displacement of stator lining shows a sinusoidal variation under internal pressure, when adapting the general form of sine function to fitting inner contour line deformation function. Then the paper analyzed the hysteresis heat generating mechanism of the motor, learning that hysteresis thermogenous of stator lining occurs due to the viscoelastic of rubber material and cyclic loading of stator lining. A heartburn happens gradually in the center of the thickest part of the stator lining as temperature increases, which means work efficiency and service life of PDM will be decreased when used in deep or superdeep well. In this paper, we established a theory equation for the choice of interference fit and motor linetype optimization design, showing hysteresis heat generating analyzing model and method are reasonable enough to significantly improve PDM’s structure and help better use PDM in deep and surdeep well."

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is different from conventional machines in that it is able to learn and do cognitive reasoning based on deep learning techniques. Although AI technology differs in terms of creativity, availability, and diversity according to the stage of development, AI is creating creativity as a non-human subject in various fields such as music, art, game, design, novel and newspaper article. AI creation lies in the blind spot of protection of existing intellectual property rights in that human beings are not directly involved in creation, and the demand for a new protection system is increasing. Discussions on the copyright protection of AI creations arecentered on Japan and the EU. In particular, the Japan Intellectual Property Strategy Headquarters issued the Artificial Intelligence Report on April 8, 2016.This paper focuses on the AI report of Japan and presents a new approach for copyright protection of AI creation. First of all, the development of AI technology is expected to produce a large number of various creative works in the future. If an exclusive right is given, it is worried about side effects due to intensification of monopolization. On the other hand, the need for copyright protection to induce investment in AI is increasing, and a harmonious approach to the pros and cons is needed. This paper argues that a very low level of protection is valid even when protecting the return on investment in existing AI industries. For example, applying ‘Thin copyright protection’ theory to AI creations, the ‘striking similarity’ rather than ‘substantial similarity’ as a component of infringement is defined as a requirement. It is suggested that criminal punishment should be excluded even in relief. In addition, to distinguish between AI creations and human’s, it is necessary to consider the introduction of new registration and labeling systems. This paper also argues that it is appropriate to set the protection period to a short term of about 5 years.Furthermore, even if it is an infringement, it is suggested to consider the possibility of using permission based on the payment of compensation rather than the prohibition of the use."

Hence, users frequently use abbreviated sequences of words and phrases. Nowadays, abbreviations are widely used from chat terms to technical terms. Therefore, gathering abbreviations would be helpful to many services, including information retrieval, recommendation system, and so on. However, manually gathering abbreviations needs to much effort and cost. This is because new abbreviations are continuously generated whenever a new material such as a TV program or a phenomenon is made. Thus it is required to generate of abbreviations automatically. To generate Korean abbreviations, the existing methods use the rule-based approach. The rule-based approach has limitations, in that it is unable to generate irregular abbreviations. Another problem is to decide the correct abbreviation among candidate abbreviations generated rules. To address the limitations, we propose a method of generating Korean abbreviations automatically using sequence-to-sequence learning in this paper. The sequenceto-sequence learning can generate irregular abbreviation and does not lead to the problem of deciding correct abbreviation among candidate abbreviations. Accordingly, it is suitable for generating Korean abbreviations. To evaluate the proposed method, we use dataset of two type. As experimental results, we prove that our method is effective for irregular abbreviations."

The research method is an action research that reflects the research activities of the researcher herself in parallel with the qualitative research method and the quantitative research method. The researchers pursued a deep understanding and practice of the art and creativity education program by repeating the spiral circulation process of planning, executing, observing and reflecting. Qualitative research methods were used in the checklist of participation in observation, record of the course including the learner discussion, and evaluation of the learning outcomes. In addition, quantitative research methods were used to compare the competence levels of preliminary teachers' creative teaching capacity.‘Introduction to Art Education in elementary school’ is a course for freshmen which is the only common essential art education in Seoul National university. The curriculum is composed with the Backward Design model, so that the pre-service teachers can understand the basic concepts in art education. In addition, the pre-service teachers were led to extend creative teaching capacity by executing various creative learning strategies used in the elementary school classrooms like visual metaphors. As a result, it was found that the experience of creative learning strategies that were continuously carried out showed a significant correlation with pre-service teachers' creative teaching capacity. Positive changes were also observed in terms of students' awareness of visual metaphor and the concept of creativity. The results of this study suggest that continuous creative pedagogical practice is the main determinant of pre-service teachers' creative teaching capacity. Raising creativity is possible through practice of competency oriented creativity enhancement program in pre-service teacher training course."

However, I intend to look at Hong Dae-yong as a thinker who pursued innovation in the teachings of Chu-tzu in Joseon. The essence of Hong’s thinking is clearly revealed through his relationship of influence with Lu Liu-liang(呂留良).Lu Liu-liang was a renowned scholar of the Chu-tzu doctrines during the rule of Qing(淸) Emperor Kangxi(康熙). Emperor Yongzheng(雍正帝) compiled and published Ta-i chueh-mi lu(大義覺迷錄) to refute Lu Liu-liang’s anti-Qing arguments that criticized the Manchu ruling of China. When this book was introduced to Joseon via envoys dispatched to China, interest in Lu Liu-liang was heightened among the Joseon intellectuals.Keeping pace with the trend in the intellectual circle at the time, Hong Dae-yong, too, inquired diligently to obtain published work of Lu Liu-liang during his travel to Beijing in 1766. In the journal of his trip to China written in Korean, Eulbyung yeonhaengnok( 乙丙燕行錄), Hong portrayed in great detail the tragic life that Lu, Liu-liang had led and praised Lu as a person with the highest learning and exceptional integrity.Hong Dae-yong’s thinking bears a striking similarity to that of Lu Liu-liang in that Hong sought innovation of the doctrines of Chu-tzu. Lu Liu-liang pursued “Silhak(Practical Learning)” to enhance the national prosperity and defense as well as to promote learning from the daily use of the people’s livelihood, and like Hong Dae-yong, revealed his keen interest in Western learning(西學). Furthermore, in his book Uisanmoondap(?山問答), Hong criticized that Chinese emperors throughout history had blindly pursued their self-interest, suggesting that Hong had embraced Chu-tzu’s disapproval of absolute monarchy. Such criticism is in line with Lu’s ideas as well. As explained thus far, Hong Dae-yong’s deep interest in Lu Liu-liang and the similarity of thought between the two scholars clearly indicate that Hong was a thinker who sought innovation of the doctrines of Chu-tzu."

In parallel with such a background, we should cultivate the recognition of reason by taking into consideration the system of various scholars, and it is said that the study of Chinese letters [Hanhak, Sino-Korean] develops properly.In case of the Tongcheng School (桐城派) in the Qing Dynasty, the stage of learning is taught as Xungu (訓誥, philology, the interpretation of a Chinese classic), Yli (義理, learning and acting of meaning and principle), and Czhang (詞章, to compose poems and essays). The Xungu (訓誥) is the literary comprehensive knowledge philology], including linguistic knowledge, which is a basic element for reading classical literature. The Yli (義理) is a way to identify the deep meaning and right reason in such a sentence. The Czhang (詞章) is a literary effort that writes in his own words what one has learned through the Xungu(訓誥) and Yili(義理).YeonMin (淵民 1917～1987), based on traditional Chinese learning, has lectured Chinese classics and written Sino-Korean texts in a university where it`s absorbed into a new institution in the modern world. He can be said to combine the New with the Old by companying the Xungu(訓誥) and Yili(義理). and Czhang(詞章).However, those [New Sino-Korean Scholars] who study exclusively within the new institutional system are generally weak in reading ability about the Chinese sentences. Rather, modern Western scholarship and the Japanese way of learning that learned it earlier are included within to some extent, so the ability of the Scholars on analyzing the theory can be said to be better than that of those who studied only in the traditional way in old days. But if it does not stand on a sufficient philological basis, it will only become a house of cards.There are many such trends in the universities that teach subjects such as Literature, history, and Philosophy related to Chinese Letters, Chinese, especially in many universities in Korea, and they are also used to imitate or copy foreign things. However, as economic power has improved and computer technology has developed, new trend has brought to the new beginning in Chinese and Korean studies.There are People who again read Chinese classics accurately and interpret them with a systematic education on Chinese classics and a translation and annotation work that are carried out with the support of the national and large corporations, re-arrangement and computerization of massive classical materials. There are also some amazing new-new scholars who have competently demonstrated their abilities in the world of Sino-Korean literature (漢文學), which is already globalized.As the interest in the value of oriental classics spreads more and more to the whole world, we will have to learn Chinese characters and Chinese characters more and more and I believe that Sino-Korean literature(漢文學) will become more and more booming.This will lead to a career path in humanities that worries so much these days."
how to train your dragon : example-guided control of flapping flight,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Imaginary winged creatures in computer animation applications are expected to perform a variety of motor skills in a physically realistic and controllable manner. Designing physics-based controllers for a flying creature is still very challenging particularly when the dynamic model of the creatures is high-dimensional, having many degrees of freedom. In this paper, we present a control method for flying creatures, which are aerodynamically simulated, interactively controllable, and equipped with a variety of motor skills such as soaring, gliding, hovering, and diving. Each motor skill is represented as Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and learned using Deep Q-Learning (DQL). Our control method is example-guided in the sense that it provides the user with direct control over the learning process by allowing the user to specify keyframes of motor skills. Our novel learning algorithm was inspired by evolutionary strategies of Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) to improve the convergence rate and the final quality of the control policy. The, effectiveness of our Evolutionary DQL method is demonstrated with imaginary winged creatures flying in a physically simulated environment and their motor skills learned automatically from user-provided keyframes.</P>"
re-weaving ecec policies and practices in japan: challenges beyond regulation- by dr. kadota-korogi,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"First of all, I would like to express my sincere appreciation for inspiring speeches of Profs. Michel Vandenbroeck, Liselott Mariett Olsson, Riyo Kadoto, and Lim, Bu-Yeun. It is my great pleasure to serve as a discussant for the invited speech by Prof. Riyo Kadota from Japan. Taking all invited speeches into consideration with a particular attention to Prof. Kadota’s presentation, I would like to share my reflections and raise some questions from policy perspectives.In most of countries including Korea, there are discrepancies between policy intentions or aspirations and its turn-out in reality. As I recognized in the revised ECEC curriculum in Japan, children’s well-being and happiness, holistic development and learning, and the continuity between early childhood and primary school education are similarly manifested and underscored in Korea’s early childhood policy documents. Somehow, these intentions are not realized to a full extent or inadvertently go against original intentions. Why such discrepancies are occurred, and what and how can we do in order to close the gaps? Obviously, post-humanism can provide insights and options in resolving these issues, such as paying more attention to localities, multiple realities and contexts.Unlike primary and secondary schools, the early childhood sector is typically market-driven, encompassing a range of private (both profit -and non-profit) and public providers to achieve quality in the same space (Johnstone, 2015). Osgood and Giugni (2015) argue that the Sector takes a stance of neo-liberalism and a human-centric approach to quality and thus, appears paralyzed within measurements and scales-driven focus on attainability and comparability. Developing international assessment tools and indicators are one of strong trends in the field (e.g., the OECD project on International Early Learning and Child Well-being; the UN’s SDG Target 4.2. global indicators for monitoring). What kinds of alternatives would be available in this regard?Data-driven and evidence-based policy is considered as a necessity in policy making. Then, the question is what types of data are useful for what purposes? Currently, all system level data are statistics with little descriptive data available on classroom practices and monitoring service quality. Statistics are meant to be efficient, but yield ‘reducted ’ rather than comprehensive information of complex phenomena. Posthumanism advocates documentation of co-constructed real life of the classroom by teachers and children. Data derived from these classroom documentation would be of immense value to ensure quality of ECEC, and thus, to policy-making. Nonetheless, it can be a burden to teachers in reality, esp. those working long hours.Providing quality services to all children is one of the utmost priorities in the ECEC system and policy in Korea and other countries. Although it is not easy to achieve a social consensus on the definition of the quality of ECEC services, it would be useful to reflect on the five perspectives on the quality in early childhood programs, identified by Katz (1993) almost twenty-five years ago: top-down, bottom-up, outside-inside, inside, and outside perspectives on quality. A top-down perspective is similar to structural quality while a bottom-up perspective refers to how the program is experienced by the participating children. An outside-inside perspective refers to parents and families, the inside perspective refers to teachers and the outside perspective takes into account the community. It is posited that each of the five perspectives contributes in a different way to identifying program quality. In particular, the bottom-up perspective involves the use of a high level of inference such as the deep feelings and thoughts of children. Regardless of risks of high inference, children’s voice and perspective are justified by the post-humanism stronger than ever before.Policy is about systems and inherently pursues a generalizability and scaling-up of good practices. In generalization, ‘the goodness of fit’ or ‘validity in a context’ of a certain policy needs to be considered foremost. Furthermore, policy-making should be a careful balancing of diverse perspectives of multiple stakeholder groups, especially of children, as echoed across speakers today. I believe the KSECE Conference on re-weaving early childhood education in a post-human era provides an enlightening learning experience to all participants including myself, and sets a good momentum to begin our collective endeavors to pay more attention to “beyond the human” in early childhood in Korea’s contexts as well as global contexts. Thank you."

The detection of temporally overlapping sound events in realistic environments is much more challenging than in monophonic detection problems. In this paper, we present an approach to improve the accuracy of polyphonic sound event detection in multichannel audio based on gated recurrent neural networks in combination with auditory spectral features. In the proposed method, human hearing perception-based spatial and spectral-domain noise-reduced harmonic features are extracted from multichannel audio and used as high-resolution spectral inputs to train gated recurrent neural networks. This provides a fast and stable convergence rate compared to long short-term memory recurrent neural networks. Our evaluation reveals that the proposed method outperforms the conventional approaches."

Two critical problems of the softmax are introduced, and an improved softmax method to resolve the problems is proposed. The proposed method minimises instability of the softmax while reducing its losses. Moreover, this method is straightforward so its computation complexity is low, but it is substantially reasonable and operates robustly.

The objective of this study was to compare the transpiration rates estimated by modified Penman-Monteith model and artificial neural network. The transpiration rate of paprika (Capsicum annuum L. cv. Fiesta) was obtained by using the change in substrate weight measured by load cells. Radiation, temperature, relative humidity, and substrate weight were collected every min for 2 months. Since the transpiration rate cannot be accurately estimated with linear equations, a modified Penman-Monteith equation using compensated radiation (Shin et al., 2014) was used. On the other hand, ANN was applied to estimating the transpiration rate. For this purpose, an ANN composed of an input layer using radiation, temperature, relative humidity, leaf area index, and time as input factors and five hidden layers was constructed. The number of perceptons in each hidden layer was 512, which showed the highest accuracy. As a result of validation, R² values of the modified model and ANN were 0.82 and 0.94, respectively. Therefore, it is concluded that the ANN can estimate the transpiration rate more accurately than the modified model and can be applied to the efficient irrigation strategy in soilless cultures."

For example, according to a joint research between Nomura Research Institute and Oxford University, Japan suggested that 49% of employment is likely to be replaced with AI or robots within the next 15 to 20 years. There is also a view that the innovation of AI, IoT and robotics will bring forth the Fourth Industrial Revolution, while increasing labor savings will create new employment needs. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry with this idea gathered experts and repeated discussions on the Fourth Industrial Revolution and compiled a report titled ""New Industrial Structure Vision"" in May this year. The report depicts the strategy and roadmap for Japan to successfully ride the wave of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and achieve economic growth. It also shows the direction of education and human resource development accompanying labor migration to human resources development and growth fields in response to the change in employment structure accompanying the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Its pivot is to revolutionize the way of education and human resource development radically to bring up talented persons who create new business. Specifically, it is to develop the following three together; (1)Human resources development at the top tier, (2)Raising of middle-skill human resources through university education and working adults training, (3)Fostering basic qualities and abilities at primary and secondary education. The third (primary and secondary education) means nurturing qualities and abilities in anticipation of a society that is entering the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The concrete direction is as follows; (1)Fostering qualities and abilities such as ability to master information, data and IT for creative problem discovery and resolution, ability to work with diverse people, sensitivity and leadership, motivation to challenge.

When they parted, must share poetry. Second, a new function has occurred in parting poem. Beyond the function to convey emotion and meaning, it was noted as a means of social intercourse. So the Tang Dynasty had a large number of parting poem, it's got a new feature. The parting poem like a recommendation letter or introduction. Third, The combination of music and poetry was rife. Many famous poems were made into songs. Like this the prevalence of parting is not accidental, it is closely related to the age conditions.Tang parting poems not write about the pain of parting, write about scenery around, a big farewell party, their deep friendship. So Parting poem in Tang dynasty is different from previous one. Before the Tang dynasty, the main idea of the parting poem is the sorrow of parting. but After the Tang dynasty, Poets form a complex structure. It made of parting time, parting place, heartbreak.They enjoyed using typical expressions in parting poem. Because it is easy to feel same emotion. So South port·Willow·sunset·alcohol·Moon are constant use. They allowed poets and readers to sympathize. Parting poem in Tang dynasty achieved universailty of parting sorrow and artistic value."

Because artificial intelligence has no ideas or emotions, even if it is created by autonomous artificial intelligence, there arises a question of whether it can not be protected under the definition of Article 2 of the current copyright law.If so, then there is a issue about whether there are any protection measures for the producer who developed and invested for such autonomously strong artificial intelligence.Second, there is a question whether technology informations generated by artificial intelligence, for example, such like inventions, designs, can be protected under the current patent law. However, Article 33 of the current Patent Act stipulates that a person who has made an invention or a successor must have the right to obtain a patent under this Act. In the end, the person who can get a patent is presuming natural persons or corporations. Since artificial intelligence is not a natural person or a corporation, there arises a issue that even if an invention is created by artificial intelligence autonomously, it is difficult to obtain a patent under the current patent law.In the end, under the current Intellectual Property Law, It is assumed that the artificial intelligence can not be protectable, regardless of whether the autonomous creations are the contents or the technical informations. If so, the challenge is how to bridge the gap between legislative deficiencies and the need for protection.In this article, we will look at several legal issues that can be predicted, especially focused on our copyright law, in conjunction with the unpredictable growth rate of artificial intelligence (AI) which associated Big Data. Unlike traditional works of art or inventions whose works or inventions are protected by the Copyright Act or the Patent Act, none of two available current intellectual property regimes -copyright or patent - protect the autonomously strong artificial intelligence generated works or inventions. So we have a challenge to find new safeguards in the intellectual property law."

So, it is important to monitor the water level of a river and to issue a flood warning during unfavorable circumstances. In this paper, we propose a modified error function to improve a hydrological modeling using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network. When MLP’s are trained to minimize the conventional mean-squared error function, the prediction performance is poor because MLP’s are highly tunned to training data. Our goal is achieved by preventing overspecialization to training data, which is the main reason for performance degradation for rare or test data. Based on the modified error function, an MLP is trained to predict the water level with rainfall data at upper reaches. Through simulations to predict the water level of Nakdong River near a UNESCO World Heritage Site “Hahoe Village,” we verified that the prediction performance of MLP with the modified error function is superior to that with the conventional mean-squared error function, especially maximum error of 40.85cm vs. 55.51cm."

For example, the sentiment information of “earthquake” in Science domain and the one in Social News domain would be “neutral” and “negative” respectively. However, since the previous word embedding methods only used syntactical information, the word “good” and “bad”, which have same usages but different sentiment, show similar word embedding vectors respectively. This paper proposes a word embedding method combines syntax information and sentiment information by domain. The network has two parts. One is Word2vec network to express syntactic information, and the other is semantic network to represent sentiment information. The semantic network needs to be trained for each domain. To improve the semantic network’s efficiency, we propose to reduce domain features using basic statistical method — TF·IDF, and combine the semantic network with pre-trained Word2vec.

And it could be seen that as for change of corruption institutions' when ‘exogenous event’ results in ‘transformation of network structure’ in ‘decisive junctures,’ the ‘condition’ of institutional change is made. That is, it can be seen that when ‘exogenous event’ causes ‘structural transformation,’ changing ‘necessary conditions’ to transform into new institutions are satisfied.

Accordingly, since ‘2016 Candlelight Revolution’ and ‘2017 Impeachment’ satisfied ‘necessary conditions’ for institutional change by reconstituting 'new anti-corruption structures'. and Moon Jaein government's 'strategic preference' and action apply to 'sufficient conditions' of institutional change.Finally, it was seen that an increase in ‘equivalence’and ‘cohesion’ among network actors is related to ‘Lock-in’ of institutions by reinforcing or linearizing ‘actors' preference.’"

The purpose of this article was to suggest some writing skills so that students majoring in natural sciences and[or] engineering could adequately write, smoothly communicate, and write a coherent set of contents in their professional fields.Efficient teaching methods can help students have humanistic imagination, delve classical materials, and write various genres and evaluations. The mind of humanities should be used to foster the writing skills of students who major in natural sciences or engineering because deep understanding of the humanities can lead to creative thinking, extend the scope of thought, and give them ability to analyze things specifically by studying. Humanistic imagination and the mind of humanities should foster precision, agile, flexibility, fluency, and creativity among students majoring in natural sciences or engineering by using music, art, culture, and literature in liberal arts. Also, students need to efficiently use classic materials to write long and insightful passages as well as fragmentary and remodeled writing. Classic documents of the Prehistoric Age are hidden from the theme and lesson so we can appreciate the ability to grasp the meaning with profound insight and detailed thought through classical works. Moreover, this paper presents teaching aspects in details to improve the writing of students majoring in natural sciences or engineering who do not prefer writing. They should be trained by advising them to write short sentences of various genres frequently. It offers specific details on teaching methods of storytelling by bringing together methods such as discussion, presentations, PPT writing, resume, cover letter, and interview rather than various learning individually because such teaching method is more efficient than other methods. The efficiency of this teaching method is maximized for improving basic writing skills of engineering students. If writing system for learners who have completed basic writing skills is conducted according to student’s each major, it could lead to better effects."

Because of this reality, many young learners are hardly learning basic communication methods and relationship skills, which should be taught through deep and intimate relationships with their parents and brothers, and situations in which they are experiencing difficulties due to this in school life and friendship are being revealed. These problems are thought to have gotten worse because of the capitalistic system that promotes the life of faster speed for the pursuit of more profits and capital growth. This paper proposes, through the concept of ‘social interstices and the field of art’ of Nicolas Bourriaud and Pierre Bourdieu, a space of the possibility for new encounters, where human interactions, which enable to achieve pure encounters and communications, can be generated, while getting out of any interests or capitalistic influence. This paper applied the concept of ‘the field of encounter between social interstice and pure meaning: the field of art  of Bourriaud and Bourdieu to design and apply an art education program for the growth of relationships as a theoretical background. The purpose and significance of this study is to estimate the educational possibilities such as how far the art education programs in schools can realize communication methods for the growth and development of relationships among learners and whether they can give practical help."

The scope of the blood relation is closely related to the structure of the society associated with ancestor worship, for example, patriarchal society, paternal line ancestry and the absolute will of the soul. Matriarchal society has a feature that it has strong faith for soul of maternal line ancestry. However, Adinkra symbol is deeply related to the social relations based on a king and a chief of village, and human relationship, and is also very dynamic in terms of order and norms of various classes. In this respect, symbol is highly social. At the same time, it is not universal, comprehensive, systematic, but it includes religious reason and behavior patterns based on its own values systems and worldviews.The evangelical mission toward people who believe in cul-ture of belief system needs access to blood relationship, that is values of the ideology of racism. It is important to find a point of contact of evangelical mission by analyzing original causes of faith, emotions and values deep placed in culture of symbolism. In addition, the gospel for an ethnic society needs to build up a sense of trust, to appropriately use storytelling and a network of relatives, and to utilize multiple and individual decision. Lastly, it is essential to lead people, having systems of Adinkra symbolism in the situation of city community or personal society by escaping from community of tribal society, to the gospel. The evangelical mission for them is possible by continually visiting them, minimizing cultural shock, and giving a welcome warmly.In order keep people who have systems and cultural values of Adinkra symbolism to the gospel constantly, evangelists have to pursuit of assimilation to Christianity culture through constant observation, application, the concern, and caring."

Confucian moral cultivation coincides with modern educational trend in regard that its goal is perfection of personality and establishment of moral community by disciplining one`s body and mind. Munmyo-ilmu is a Confucian ritual dance presenting manners and rights to be shared among people which has been a means to educate liberal arts and train body and soul for ages. As said in a Confucius saying: ""Arts produce a kind of pleasure which human nature cannot do without."", the dance is a guide for developing self-taught, global talents. From cultivating human nature and building creativity to enhancing communication, collaboration, and leadership skills, qualities more emphasized nowadays, Munmyo-ilmu suggests deep implications to present education of arts. Munmyo-ilmu education will provide its trainees the opportunity to grow into trust-worthy, influencial leaders with increased creativeness and highly effiecient communication and collboration skills based on enhanced solitude by learning the ethics of Confusian and building chacacters on it.

All the scriptures, i.e. the so-called Eighty Thousands Buddhist Sutras and all the sermons that your‘sunim’delivers to you are concerned with enlightenment: they are all purported to explain what Buddha nature is and how you get there. But one of the basic tenets of Seon Buddhism is that there is no way of characterizing what Seon is: no words and expressions can capture the truth. Truth and words are incompatible. In spite of this dilemma, however, Seon masters and students never stop trying to describe or explain it with words. Human language seems to be a kind of necessary evil. In this regard, Wonhyo(617~686), the great Buddhist priest in the Shilla period, has pointed out that“no matter how deep truth may be, how can it escape from the appearances of things?

The hypothesis is also known as “linguistic relativity principle” or “linguistic determinism.” Instead of climbing the bandwagon in support of the generally unfavorable criticisms of the hypothesis by the main stream linguistics community today, I think we should choose to learn from the insight hidden in the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, and we can reexamine the hypothesis in terms of Wonhyo’s Theory of Reconciliation.

His works exhibit the skillful use of Western painting techniques. This study focuses on the paintings entitled the Assembly of Deities(諸尊集會圖) and Tejaprabha(熾盛光如來圖) that he produced during the modern period and which are currently kept at the Songgwangsa Museum. Though there have been studies on Ilseop and his Buddhist paintings, and various theses have dealt with his paintings, the two works mentioned above remain little known despite their importance and have never been dealt with in detail. As such, this study attempts to sheds light on them in detail and review Ilseop’s capabilities and activities as a painter.The paintings of the Assembly of Deities and Tejaprabha are important paintings as they depict unique-looking, pan-religious and multi-national figures using Western painting and engraving techniques. The diverse techniques and images displayed by the pieces and the content of his work diary reveal that he took a deep interest in not only Buddhist fine arts, but also Western paintings, sculptures, and designs, and even the trend of academic learning and arts of his time. It is interesting to see how he and Kim Bok-jin, who competed with him at the time of bidding for the commission to produce the main Maitreya Buddha of Geumsansa Temple in Gimje, influenced each other. His two paintings are among his most representative works as they exhibit his artistic skills, his interest, his perspectives as an artist, and his view of the period in which he lived."

RGB-D 정보를 이용하여 탐지된 객체의 영역을 재조정하여 생성된 입력 데이터를 한 사람의 자세 추정을 위한Convolutional Pose Machines(CPM)에 적용한다. CPM을 이용하여 한 사람당 14개의 신체부위에 대한 신념 지도(Belief Map)를 생성하고, 신념 지도를 기반으로 신체 키포인트를 검출한다. 이와 같은 방법은 키포인트를 검출할 객체에 대한 정확한 영역을 제공하게 되며, 개별적인 신체 키포인트의 검출을 통하여 단일 신체 키포인트 검출에서 다중 신체 키포인트 검출로 확장 할 수 있다. 향후, 검출된 키포인트를 이용하여 인간 자세 추정을 위한 모델을 생성할 수 있으며 인간 행위 인식 분야에 기여 할 수 있다.","Recently, in the field of video surveillance, a Deep Learning based learning method has been applied to a method of detecting a moving person in a video and analyzing the behavior of a detected person. The human activity recognition, which is one of the fields this intelligent image analysis technology, detects the object and goes through the process of detecting the body keypoint to recognize the behavior of the detected object. In this paper, we propose a method for Body Keypoint Localization based on Object Detection using RGB-D information. First, the moving object is segmented and detected from the background using color information and depth information generated by the two cameras. The input image generated by rescaling the detected object region using RGB-D information is applied to Convolutional Pose Machines for one person's pose estimation. CPM are used to generate Belief Maps for 14 body parts per person and to detect body keypoints based on Belief Maps. This method provides an accurate region for objects to detect keypoints an can be extended from single Body Keypoint Localization to multiple Body Keypoint Localization through the integration of individual Body Keypoint Localization. In the future, it is possible to generate a model for human pose estimation using the detected keypoints and contribute to the field of human activity recognition."
audio enhancement using local snr-based sparse binary mask estimation and spectral imputation,2017,"['Speech enhancement', 'Audio enhancement', 'Sparse binary mask', 'Local signal-to-noise ratio', 'Spectral imputation', 'Non-negative matrix factorization']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper proposes a method for enhancing speech and/or audio quality under noisy conditions. The proposed method first estimates the local signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the noisy input signal via sparse non-negative matrix factorization (SNMF). Next, a sparse binary mask (SBM) is proposed that separates the audio signal from the noise by measuring the sparsity of the pool of local SNRs from the adjacent frequency bands of the current and several previous frames. However, some spectral gaps remain across frequency bands after applying the binary masks, which distorts the separated audio signal due to spectral discontinuity. Thus, a spectral imputation technique is used to fill the empty spectrum of the frequency band where it is removed by the SBM. Spectral imputation is conducted by online learning NMF with the spectra of the neighboring non-overlapped frequency bands and their local sparsity. The effectiveness of the proposed enhancement method is demonstrated on two different tasks use speech and musical content, respectively. Consequently, objective measurements and subjective listening tests show that the proposed method outperforms conventional speech and audio enhancement methods, such as SNMF-based alternatives and deep recurrent neural networks for speech enhancement, block thresholding, and a commercially available software tool for audio enhancement."

In the course of 1807, Nam Gongcheol received his preface to prominent figures of the Qing such as Cao Jiang曹江, Li Linsong李林松, and Chen Xizu陳希祖, and was included in his collection of works published in 1815 by himself. Among them, especially, Cao Jiang was already known among the intellectuals of Joseon, so Nam Gongcheol visited Cao Jiang without hesitation. In Beijing, too, Nam Gongcheol met directly with the Zhu Yuren猪裕仁 and Wu Siquan吳思權. He also left a record of the meeting with Ryukyu琉球 ambassadors.Because all of the preface was wrote by descendant of the people of Ming明, Nam Gongcheol set them in his anthology as a preface. In addition, Zhu Yuren褚裕仁 and Wu Siquan吳思權 were all descendants of the Ming明, Nam Gongcheol felt strong sympathy for them. Such consciousness of conscience was expressed by the discrimination against Man people滿人 and Han people漢人.It is surprising to note that Nam Gongcheol, who was once enthusiastic with the school to learn the Qing Dynasty such as Park Jiwon, Yu Deukgong, and Park Jaega, however, he basically was lied in the background of the family and the political background that can not throw up the Daemyung loyalty大明義理論. It was perhaps natural that his father, Nam Yuyong, had written a history of Ming明, and that emphasized the faithful to Daemyung loyalty. In addition, most of the Joseon intellectuals at that time, in spite of the craze to learn the civilization of Qing Dynasty, could not deny the Daemyung loyalty actively. Yi Dukmu who closely cooperated with Nam Gongcheol, also had a great interest in the descendant of Ming people.As well known, Nam Gongcheol was a eclectic for Han Methodology漢學 and Song Methodology宋學. However, accepting the merits of Han Methodology漢學 is to relativize Song Methodology宋學, which is contradictive to the Daemyung loyalty, which had been weakened from the beginning. The reason why Nam Gongcheol, who had this self-contradiction, did not give up the Daemyung loyalty until the end was the courtesy to Ming people and the compassion for them through discrimination.In the late Chosun dynasty, the Daemyung loyalty can be said to show the deep self-contradiction of the intellectuals who could stand up at the final stage of Daemyung loyalty in the early 19th century. They acknowledged the merits of Han Methodology漢漢, which was to relativize the orthodox Neo-Confucianism. However, as the Daemyung loyalty was based on the orthodox Neo-Confucianism, they did not give up the that by expressing sympathy for the descendant of the people of Ming明. Because of his family background and political status, it seems that Nam Gongcheol was forced to ignore the advanced artifacts of the Qing Dynasty while experiencing the journey to the Qing Dynasty."

It applies frame semantics for a method of inquiry learning of poetic words as a presentation of metaphors, so it premises that learners could understand and inquiry meaning plentifully with their contexts of life. This is a perspective of conceptual meaning as a thought and phenomenon revealed deep understanding of objects. By this perspective, poetic words imply a metaphorical phenomenon of poetry, eventually an inquiry of poetic words’ meaning could be connected to grasp meanings of poetry.For these argumentation, this study gets features of frame semantics and find out that frame semantics could provide a rich understanding of poetic words’ meaning due to a contextuality of the meaning. And then, after examining a relation between the metaphor and the frame on a perspective of conceptual meaning, it establishes that the meaning inquiry through frames of poetic words as a presentation of poetic metaphor is a method to understand phenomenons of metaphor in poetry. Finally, it designs a class practice of an inquiry learning of poetic words’ meaning using the frame, and the class practice was implied and elaborated by the class criticism."

After gaining independency from China, in 1042 Lý Dynasty(Nhà Lý 1009–1225), the first one of sustained stability proclaimed the criminal code(刑書 Hình thư) emulating the Tang Code(唐律 Tanglü) which had been a model code in East Asia. Trần Dynasty(Nhà Trần 1226–1400), the succeeding one also enacted the codes amending the former dynasty’s ones. These codes can be seldom preserved. Lê Code(國朝刑律 Quốc triều hình luật, Luật Hồng Đức) of the Later Lê Dynasty(Nhà Hậu Lê 1428–1789) remains. Although it maintains the Tang Code’s format and contains a lot of provisions affected by it, Lê Code has far outnumber contents of Vietnam’s own legal tradition.  The Tang Code system of it can be understood as the tendency to revise and supplement the former codes, Lê Code also reveals a deep understanding of the Tang Code and the Ming Code(大明律 Daminglü) and development aspect of Vietnam’s own legal history that her own culture on law had been a center of the codes. the Lê Code should not be judged as a fruit of influence of Chinese legal system, but a result of Vietnam’s leading role about her own legislation. Therefore I concluded as following:   ⑴ The Lê Code is a historical document that contains enforcements and developments of law.   ⑵ The Lê Code is a material showing off the code of the Vietnam nation which had been succeeded in spite of the dynastic changes.  ⑶ The Lê Code is a proof revealing independent tradition of the Vietnamese judicial system as well as the global effect of Chinese codes."

In total, 36 issues of the journal had been seasonally published up to the ‘final’ Spring 2006 issue. We put forward the basic concept of the journal with “a journal that explores the desires of women” and developed the “if spirit” of “Let’s laugh! Let’s overturn! Let’s play!” “Let’s laugh!” So far, we, women have shed too many tears. But now, we want to laugh. Laugh makes us glad and happy. We want to laugh like exploding silence, and like a shooting up fountain. Let’s laugh! “Let’s overturn!” Born and living as women in this world, we have preserved a desire that has grown naturally in our inner selves. And we came to realize that we all have the same desires and that those desires are destructive. We want to overturn. We want to overturn this world with joy. Aren’t you wondering what will happen then? “Let’s Play!” So far, we have got used to tears and pain. It was nothing other than a boring learning process of pain, patience, and sacrifice to live as women in this world. That process finally has presented us with peace of mind of slaves. But now, we don’t want it any more. We want to be merry. We want to have fun. We want to play. And we want to make women joyful.‘IF’ explored the question of “Sexual Harrassment of Male Intellectuals” for the special topic of the launching issue, which received huge attention from the entire media as well as high resonation by the public. This work is still mentioned by many people, leaving deep impression of the journal in Korea society. ‘IF’ continued to touch on a variety of issues that had been discussed rarely by Korean women, such as “We Don’t Want to Give Birth to Child”, “Allow Women the Night Life”, and “Full-scale War with Patriarchy”.In 2017, the 20th anniversary of the foundation of ‘IF’, certain momentum was being gained for doing something among the original members of launching the journal.

In the book, 26 feminists ranging from their 20’s to 60’s reflect on their diverse lives and tell frankly about their respective experiences leading them to become feminists in Korea."

The TRS for elementary and junior high school teachers to move their work place after a certain period of work has been established for a long time as a part of the personnel administration. In light of the importance of the system, it is true that efforts to improve the policy and studies of relevant academics have not been active. Now it is time to set an alternative direction through the academic reflection of the TRS. This study is not only to examine the three principles of students’ right to learn, teacher's right to pursue happiness, school improvement, but also to compare school performance and dysfunction in the value-free dimension for considering the development plan of the TRS. It is necessary to revisit the TRS by focusing on improving the quality of schooling through raising the morale of teachers. The TRS should be made so as to promote student's right to learn and school education together with the stability of life of teachers. The TRS should be operated on the basis of establishing legal and operational principles. It is necessary to take some measures such as the establishment of teacher rotation logics and principles, extending minimum teacher rotation periods, rational teacher rotation notification time, weight standard rationalization, rotation respite, irregular rotation, special measures to teachers having special needs, rotation balancing gender and career years, disclosure and complaint, best practice sharing and the network construction, strategies and methods of promoting teacher rotation system. In the future, it is required for urgent research for effective policy alternatives in addition to deep academic discussion on the TRS."

an efficient damage information extraction from government disaster reports,2017,"['Damage Information', 'Information Extraction', 'Government Disaster Report', 'Damage Property', 'User-generated Text']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"One of the purposes of Information Technology (IT) is to support human response to natural and social problems such as natural disasters and spread of disease, and to improve the quality of human life. Recent climate change has happened worldwide, natural disasters threaten the quality of life, and human safety is no longer guaranteed. IT must be able to support tasks related to disaster response, and more importantly, it should be used to predict and minimize future damage. In South Korea, the data related to the damage is checked out by each local government and then federal government aggregates it. This data is included in disaster reports that the federal government discloses by disaster case, but it is difficult to obtain raw data of the damage even for research purposes.In order to obtain data, information extraction may be applied to disaster reports. In the field of information extraction, most of the extraction targets are web documents, commercial reports, SNS text, and so on. There is little research on information extraction for government disaster reports. They are mostly text, but the structure of each sentence is very different from that of news articles and commercial reports. The features of the government disaster report should be carefully considered. In this paper, information extraction method for South Korea government reports in the word format is presented. This method is based on patterns and dictionaries and provides some additional ideas for tokenizing the damage representation of the text. The experiment result is F1 score of 80.2 on the test set. This is close to cutting-edge information extraction performance before applying the recent deep learning algorithms."

According to a previous study, in such a case, it is said that understanding and acquiring the language used by a mother having a foreign nationality make a deep effect on the personality formation process of a child as well as improving the quality of communication between a child and the mother. However, a child's recognition of the language used by a parent having a foreign nationality becomes different depending on each kind of language. Among them, in case of a multi󰠏cultural family having a mother from Japan, around 54% of the parents want their children to learn Japanese and around 74% of the children also want to learn Japanese.

Its derivative virtuous women tales are, however, in a different circumstance as they have a greater focus on the acts of Park Je-sang's wife than his patriotism and loyalty. These tales state that the wife, who learns the death of her husband, becomes the nation's guardian, a bird hiding in the crack of a rock, or a bird with a deep grudge after committing suicide. Attention should be paid to these differences. While Samgukyusa merely records that Park Je-sang's wife became the holy mother of statesmanship after death, the derivative virtuous women tales show different endings for her. In other words, Samgukyusa presents only the sacred ending, whereas the derivative tales tell diverse endings including the sacred and tragic ones.The Park Je-sang’s tale of Samgukyusa and its derivative virtuous woman tales can categorized three types of virtuous women: virtuous women that became a god, ""those that became a hiding bird, and those that became a revengeful spirit. The first category can be found in Park Je-sang’s tale of Samgukyusa and one of its derivative virtuous women tales. Since this type has a strong mythical nature, it has been losing its transmission power due to the subjects of transmission that place importance on reality in modern times. The second and last categories have a ""pass of statesmanship"" and ""rock of a hiding bird,"" respectively; thus, they are still enjoying their transmission power. The tales ""virtuous women that became a god"" with mythical nature secured their transmission power in the past when they placed importance on virtue, and the tales of ""virtuous women that became a hiding bird"" and ""those that became a revengeful spirit"" with an object of transmission and legendary nature secure their transmission power in modern times as the awareness of virtue has weakened. These findings indicate that Park Je-sang’s tale of Samgukyusa and its derivative virtuous women tales have either secured or lost transmission power due to the changing perceptions of ""virtue"" on the part of the transmission subjects."

Since his childhood, he had enjoyed contemplating and observing in nature. Based on profound confidence in human nature, he tried to independently explore truth and be self-satisfied. Not only was he interested in study of Cheng Zhu, the then mainstream but he also studied deep into philosophies of Shao Yong and Zhang Zai in Northern Song to construct his own world of study. As a result, he established the theory on Qi philosophy and offered an opportunity to deepen discussion on Liqi theory in history of Joseon’s Neo-Confucianism. His spirit of enjoying study in forest played a role to form a tradition of exploring truth without being swayed by reality.  Hwadam put emphasis on Zhouyi, which is well demonstrated from the fact that he took his pen name Bokjae (復齋) from Bokgwae (復卦) and it is also easy to see Zhouyi-related contents on his writings. Hwadam interpreted Zhouyi in an emblemo-numerology perspective but he understood it in a viewpoint of righteousness philosophy that emphasized moral cultivation, practice and political ideals as well. Hwadam regarded Bokgwae and Gangwae (艮卦) as particularly important among Zhouyi.  He connected the principle in the way of Heaven with Bokgwae and explained that reason in his writings of Dongjieum (冬至吟) and Bokgigyeoncheonjisimseol (復其見天地之心說). All things are constantly making movements without either start or end. This is mind of ‘constant growth and development (生生不息)’ and that of heaven and earth. Reason in the world we live in is of constant repetition of Yin and Yang and the logic of Bok (復, repetition) continues. If one knows the reason of Bok, he will soon become enlightened but Hwadam thought that this reason of Bok also was an important guide in human action or art of living.  In addition, he stressed ‘Ji (止, stop)’ of Gangwae as humanity. Hwadam regarded Gangwae as the principle of moral cultivation and practice. His idea is well presented in his writing of Songsimgyosuseo. The meaning of stop is the most universal feature observed from human or natural phenomena. One should stop and leave when he should. ‘Ji’ here means ‘timeliness’, which means that one should realize the reason of ‘Ji’ through study and it is the very purpose of one’s studying.  Hwadam emphasizes that humanity and the way of Heaven should be connected with ‘truth of timeliness (時中之道)’; that one should realize the logic of Bok that the universe always follows certain laws, the way of Heaven and; humanity should be practiced as the reason of ‘Ji.’ He regarded this logic as highly important in his art of living and practiced it. In his own situations, he thought that a retired life was the ‘timeliness’ rather than going into government service and selected the life of stop as in the logic of ‘Ji.’ Despite of many times of recommendations, therefore, he rejected going into government service or entering the government but he devoted himself to study in a life in seclusion. He lived a retired life to practice the stop to adapt to laws of the universe rather than being swept away by world’s glory and shame caused by going into government service. Zhouyi is regarded having much impact on why he chose this life. He was self-sufficient with balance and moderation he learned from Zhouyi and led a detached and upright life with view of life and outlook on art of living by being content amid poverty and taking pleasure in acting in an honest way."

The main tone and scale of Namdo Sinawi is Ra(ending tune)-Dosi(bending tune)-Mi(deep vibration tune) but the scale of Gyeonggi Sinawi is a little bit different. Although some scholars find out of the musical feature of Gyeonggi Sinawi, it is still mysterious. Therefore on the paper try to find out the features of Sinawi through checking several music records of Piri players of Gyeonggi and Chung-cheong Area. First, the most earliest music record of Piri Sinawi is Han, sung-jun (1874) from Chung-cheong Area. His Piri Sinawi is the combination of Namdo Sinawi melody and <Gugoeri> and <Yeomgul-Taryeong> which have the feature like sol-ra-do-re-mi scale and Piri technique of shaman rituals of Seoul and Gyeonggi area.Second, the examples of next generation of Han, sung-jun are Lee, il-sun(1989), Lee, chung-seon(1901) and Ji, yeong-hee(1909) from Gyeonggi area and the family of shaman group. They are connected with Han, sung-jun in music activity and also the scale of the Sinawi shows similar features with Han, sung-jun’s Sinawi although they are not same shaman group. Their Sinawi is different with Namdo sinawi of Jeon-la Province which use only Ra-dosi-Mi scale. Third, the next generation of second generation learn the Sinawi from modern educational institute.Because of flexible technique of the Sinawi, it wasn’t selected as school curriculum. This process provides missing some technique of Piri Sinawi. The palyers of early 20th century could freely changed music range by moving the finger hole. However, today’s Piri player play Sinawi in only fixed range. To sum up, through checking the music records of Piri Sinawi of Gyeonggi and Chung-cheong Area in chronological order, the scale and technique of Piri Sinawi shows combination feature shaman ritual music of Seoul and Jeon-la province. So Sinawi of Gyeonggi and Chung-cheong Piri player is a little bit different from Namdo Sinawi which directly related with Jeon-la province and we particularly called it as Gyeonggi Sinawi and today’s Gyeonggi Sinawi missed some techniques about changing music range by finger hole."

교회갱신을 위한 지역사회 돌봄과 섬김의 리더십 훈련 연구,2017,"['Church renewal', 'caring', 'serving', 'Church of the Saviour', 'servant leadership discipline', 'core principle']","교회에 대한 사회적 공신력이 급감한 현실에서 교회의 갱신이 요구된다. 특히 교회는 성장지상주의와 개교회주의를 극복하여 팽창주의적 배타적 집단이 아닌, 타자에 대한 경계를 너머서서 타자를 위한 연대, 환대, 사랑, 돌봄, 섬김의 삶을 살아야 한다.  본 논문에서는 이를 현재화하는 미국의 세이비어교회의 목회리더십과 실천구조를 살펴보고, 배타적 경계를 넘어 사회적 돌봄과 섬김을 지향하는데 기반이 되는 섬김의 리더십 훈련을 고찰하였다. 그리고 세이비어교회의 섬김의 리더십 훈련을 지역사회의 상황에 맞게 적용하는 한국의 선한목자 교회-선한 공동체의 사례를 분석하였다. 이 두 교회의 섬김의 리더십 훈련의 교육과정과 핵심원리, 다양한 사역들을 통해 영성과 사역, 개인과 공동체, 교회와 지역의 균형을 피력하였다.  첫째, 영성과 사역의 균형은 내면을 향한 여정과 세상을 향한 여정이 함께 추구되는 것이다. 이 두 가지 형태의 여정을 위해서는 구체적이고 엄격한 훈련과정이 필요하며, 책임성을 함양하는 과정과 사역공동체를 위해 준비된 삶이 요구된다. 교회의 본질인 영성과 사역, 이론과 실천, 내면을 향한 여행과 세상을 향한 여행을 균형 있게 발전하는 교회, 온전한 헌신을 이루어 섬김의 리더십을 추구하는 교회에 대해 깊이 숙고하고 방향성을 제시해야 한다. 둘째, 개인과 공동체의 균형이다. 섬김의 리더십이 단순한 자원봉사 활동에서 끝나지 않으려면 각자의 재능과 소명을 찾고 분별하기 위해 영적인 노력이 필요하다. 그리고 개인주의가 팽배한 시대에 교회 안에서의 일반적 교제에 그치는 것이 아니라 하나님과 성도들, 이웃들까지 깊이 연결되고 관계를 맺는 공동체를 형성해야 한다. 셋째, 교회와 지역의 균형이다. 교회의 갱신은 예수의 사랑과 연민의 시선을 갖고 지역사회를 ‘바라봄’과‘자기 초대’를 실천해야 한다. 자신들만 사랑(self-love)하는 교회는 나르시시즘에 빠진다. 바벨탑을 지은 내면적 동기는 외국인 혐오(xenophobia)였다. 이들은 낯선 이들을 두려워했고, 하나의 언어를 만들려고 했다. 세이비어교회를 통한 섬김의 리더십은 다양성을 인정(philoxenia)하며 낯선 이들을 사랑하고, 환대하며 실천하는 일을 가능케 하며, 교회의 존재와 미래가 좌우될 사회적 공신력 회복을 위한 교회갱신의 초석이 된다.","This paper is a study on the renewal of the church through social care and service in the age of weakening social trust in Christianity. This paper pointed out that Christianity is a cause of social anxiety and jealousy for the growth ideology of church and the church. It is Criticized that this ideological and pastoral attitude influenced the expansionist exclusive community and it is becoming a doctrinal, institutional, selfish, and idolatrous church. As a result, there is an aggregation in the church, but it has not formed a congregation that participates in the community and learns and practices the divine life of the Trinity God. To overcome this problem, we have trained the life of solidarity, hospitality, love, caring, and service beyond the boundaries of each other and the other, the true life of Jesus, not Jesus at the center of selfish churches as a growth ideology and institutionalized religion We must practice. Through the study on Church of the Saviour in Washington, DC, USA, the practice of doing this is the exploration of the various ministries, the meanings and practices in them, and the six core principles are required for leadership in service, prayer(sanctification prayer), Bible study(hunger for justice), Faith community(life style formation for Christian), Vocation(loving God and neighbor), A relationship that is free in the community(belonging Church and Christian), and Spirituality(trinitarian spirituality, perichoresis) in the community. In addition, studied how to apply the leadership of service in accordance with the situation and environment by examining the educational process and training of the Good Shepherd Church - good community, which is an example of servicing and serving the community through the leadership training of Saviour Church in Korea.  While there are many seminars and strategies in the era of church and ministry crisis, the leadership training of the servitude Church of the Saviour provides paradigm shifts in education ministry and leadership. First, it is the balance between spirituality and ministry in which the journey toward the inside and the journey toward the world are manifested. Second, it is not a personal fellowship but a balance of individuals and communities that form deep relationships in God with saints and neighbors. Third, with the eyes of Jesus"" love and compassion, we look at the community, entertain and invite strangers, and balance church and community.   Considering these three points of application for church renewal, conducting leadership training over an exclusive boundary will enable the church to survive and restore social confidence, which will depend on the future, and lead to a healthy church leadership and revival that will lead the times."

The purpose of this article is to inquire about how to establish and relate to the relationship between the churches in Suncheon and the Presbyterian Missionary Society in the United States. This is done through the context of the opening of the Eunseong School in 1913, the establishment of the Maesan School in 1921, and the closure of the Maesan School in 1937. Eunseong School, which was opened in 1913, has meaning beyond the ‘Suncheon Area Educational Mission’. The Presbyterian Missionary Society in the United States wanted to know the needs of Suncheon-Eup Church (Current Suncheon Central Church), which had grown into a Protestant self-sustainable faith community early on. The Society also wanted to know the needs of community members who cooperated while agreeing on the establishment of the Missionary Station in Suncheon. The cooperation was shaped by the meeting of 1909 and in deciding the establishment of the Suncheon Mission Station in 1910. However, Eunseong School was closed in 1916 because it could not teach Bible subjects due to the revision of the private school rules of Japanese imperialism in 1915. During this time, the Missionary Society communicated Christian values through a new science and vocational education, and the local church believers showed learning and aspirations of modernization. In this way, the Missionary Society and the local church communicated with deep trust. Above all the Eunseong School was rooted in the perception that it is a ‘Bible teaching school’ in the Suncheon area. Opened in 1921, the establishment of the Maesan School was made under the Japanese cultural and political situation of Korea after the 3.1 movement. On the other hand, it was also a result of the efforts of local Christian figures to establish a private school. The Missionary Society wanted to open only the primary school for financial reasons, but a minister of the Suncheon-Eup Church, Lee Gee-Pung and some members strongly demanded the establishment of the high-grade school. The local churches and the Missionary Society in this period joined forces to revive the Maesan School and cooperated to establish a high-grade school. This would raise Christian workers while sharing the recognition that the churches and schools should eventually lay the foundation for regional missions. However, Maesan School voluntarily closed its doors as a refusal to go to the shrine in the autumn of 1937. Few Christian figures lamented that the mission school was closed due to the issue of visiting the shrine at that time. Local residents of the region also regarded the disappearance of Mission School as the disappearance of the last hope of Korean liberation. At this time, the Presbyterian Missionary Society in the United States saw the issue of shrine visits as “a problem between monotheism and polytheism,” and “conceding on the issue of shrine visits ruins all Christian mission objectives and programs.” In the end, Maesan School was voluntarily closed, and the Suncheon presbytery, a group of churches in the Suncheon area, decided to visit the shrine and expressed a different position from the Missionary Society. Since then, the Koinonia between the Missionary Society and the local churches has been cut off. However, it is no exaggeration to say that the closure of Maesan School changed the future terrain of Korean Christianity more than the modernization which was the desire of the Korean people at that time. What is Christian faith in history? It is an event that the Christian faith and its meaning have been thrown into a new dimension. Although the closure of the Maesan School happened in the past, it will serve as a factor that enriches the whole educational mission of the Suncheon area."

PL의 자격 조건 역시 르노와 닛산 사이에는 차이가 있는데, 르노의 PL에게 요구되는 조건이 근속연수보다 개인적 업무 역량인 반면, 닛산 PL은 일정 근속연수에 바탕을 둔 전문적 경험이 선정 기준으로 더 중요하다. 르노와 닛산이 최고경영진으로부터 PD의 역할과 책임에 대해 동일한 원칙을 부여 받았음에도 불구하고, 원칙을 실제로 적용함에 있어 큰 차이가 있다. 신제품 개발을 위한 프로젝트 조직구조와 이를 운영하는 방식에 있어 발견된 차이점과 공통점은 첫째, PD의 업무영역이다. 르노에서 PD는 최고경영자를 대신하여 프로젝트에서 정한 목표를 총괄 감독하는데, 목표와 실제로 차이가 나는 부분에 대해 실행방안, 조언 및 조정을 통해 목표를 달성하도록 하는 역할이다. 르노의 PD는 조정은 물론 의사결정자로서의 역할을 수행한다. 닛산의 PD 역시 조정 역할과 함께 기능부서간 발생하는 갈등을 최종적으로 해결할 수 있는 권한을 위임 받지만, 닛산 PD의 주요 업무는 원가와 관련된 분야에 집중돼 있고 최종의사결정자로서의 역할은 작다고 할 수 있다. 르노와 닛산 모두 최고경영자와 집행위원회가 주요한 사항들을 최종적으로 결정한다. PD가 제대로 역할을 수행하기 위한 전제조건은 모든 기능부서가 PD에게 모든 자원과 정보를 제공해야만 한다는 것이다. 동시에, PD는 어떠한 제약조건 없이 모든 담당 실무진에 접근이 가능해야 하는데, 르노의 경우 PD는 엔지니어링 부문 이외의 실무진에 대한 영향력이 상대적으로 작은 편이다. 닛산의 경우, PD는 신제품 개발 프로젝트에 있어 주요 부문 책임자들 중의 한 명으로 분류된다. 둘째, 프로젝트 조직의 위치에서 두 회사는 차이가 있다. 닛산의 경우,전통적으로 각 기능부서 및 부문의 독립성이 강하기 때문에, 각 부문을 대표하는 PL들은 각자 속해 있는 기능부문에서 프로젝트 업무를 수행하는데, 이 점이 르노와 확연히 구별된다. 르노에서는 신제품 개발 프로젝트를 담당하는 PL들이 PD와 함께 독립된 장소에서 모두 모여 업무를","The operational practices and processes used by automakers have largely remained unexplored due to theinherent challenges of limited access to their unique operational practices and embargoes placed by them toprotect their competitive advantage. This paper presents practices used in a New Product Development(NPD) project in Renault Samsung Motors, Inc., which is an International Joint Venture (IJV) betweenRenault and Samsung, and also a part of the strategic alliance between Renault and Nissan. Data collectedfrom multiple sources including observations, document analysis and interviews employing a longitudinalethnographic approach were analyzed using qualitative analysis techniques. The findings show a number ofsignificant gaps between the project management practices of the two firms including: 1) while the ProjectDirector (PD) at Renault enjoys much more influence over the project than does a PD at Nissan, neithercould be considered a ‘heavyweight’ PD who is fully responsible for the results of the projects, (2) projectmanagement practices for NPD in Renault and Nissan were initially based on the same functional organizationstructures, but have evolved in different directions, and (3) despite the convergence of some practices due tocommon platform development and co-learning, differences remained vividly evident in PM practices indesign and engineering, product planning concepts, and engineering standards.

Legal education as a general(liberal) education will be a great help in reinforcing the capability of advanced democratic citizens that Korea needs at present. Liberal democracy must be able to overcome authoritarian thinking that only my thinking is right and to be able to be established in everyday life, not in decorative sense. In liberal arts education, the goal is not different when it is aimed at law. Furthermore, through the acquisition of legal thinking, systematic thinking and problem solving ability can be cultivated together.Open liberal education naturally includes 'law'. It is necessary to learn about why the 'basic knowledge of law' is needed as a liberal arts personally through the curriculum and to encourage them to practice it in daily life. Although Korea is successful in catching two rabbits of democratization and economy, it is necessary to deepen democracy in order to develop into advanced country. It will begin with an understanding of the constitutional value order necessary for all citizens to be at least an educated citizen and to understand the basic principles of liberal democracy and the true meaning of the rule of law. It is time to mature mentally. In particular, the necessity of liberal education is prominent for the democratization and deepening of liberal democracy.In this paper, we first inquire the general meaning of liberal arts education(definition, method, purpose, direction etc.) and its usefulness as a promoter of critical thinking. It is also going to become clear that the increase of liberty and equality has grown by the expansion of liberal education. And I will emphasize that 'legal education as a liberal education' will contribute to this. For this purpose, I explained the concrete contents of it. Then, I briefly presented a rough overview of the legal education as a general education I think. At the end of this article I have proposed a provisional lecture that distinguishes it from the existing introductory books of law."

Just as the first Industrial Revolution triggered the mechanical revolution utilizing the steam engine, the mechanical revolution led to the development of music based on musical instrument production and music printing. . As the secondary industrial revolution using electric power made mass production possible, the development and recording technology using electricity drastically changed the paradigm of music production and appreciation. Since then, the development of computers, the Internet, and information and communication technology has brought about a third industrial revolution that greatly improves productivity. In the field of music production, computer-based music production has become universal and productivity has been maximized. After the first, second, and third industrial revolutions, the fourth industrial revolution has arrived based on a variety of innovative technologies such as Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Internet of Objects, and 3D Printing. In the field of music, this phenomenon is similar. The fourth industrial revolution is expected to bring about a lot of innovations in the production process to improve productivity, but the danger of mass unemployment is also high because there are relatively many areas that are inevitably replaced by artificial intelligence. This will result in the emergence of a new type of occupation to manage copyrighted works that A.I based artists produce. In preparation for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, musicians should also take a convergence attitude that breaks the boundaries between areas, and managers with technology and platforms should think of musicians as assets or families rather than as parts. After all, in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, simple works will be replaced by machines, but creators with inspiration and creativity will be welcome in the future. To this end, the form of art education should be developed in the direction of nurturing creative talents."

재난관리 분야에서 스마트 플랫폼의 역할과 전망,2017,"['재난현장', '재난정보', '재난관리', '스마트 플랫폼']","최근 사회구조의 복잡화, 산업구조의 다변화, 기후변화 등에 의해 자연재해 및 산업재해, 도시재난이 급 증하고, 그 규모 또한 대형화하고 있다. 이로 인해 에너지, 통신, 교통, 금융 등 공공 인프라의 피해가 급증 하면서 작은 재해도 큰 재난으로 변하는 예가 늘어나고 있다. 한편 현대사회에 대한 IT의 관여도가 급속도 로 늘어나면서 IT 서비스의 궁극적인 형태이자, 모든 산업을 수용하는 개념의 플랫폼(Platform)이 IT를 넘 어서 글로벌 사회의 절대적 지배자로 등장했다. 또한 전 세계 유저들의 관점에서 보면 개개인들이 손에 든 스마트폰이 생활의 모든 분야에 걸쳐 소통, 정보, 쇼핑, 제보, 오락 등 모든 활동의 수단으로 절대적 가치 를 창출하고 있다. 이는 스마트폰이 가진 스마트 데이터 생산 및 공유 기능에서 비롯된다. 이처럼 스마트 데이터를 기반으로 한 IT플랫폼이 중요한 위치를 점하지만, 아직 재난관리 분야에서 이를 본격적으로 도 입, 활용하지 못하고 있다는 점은 큰 문제이다. 국내의 사정을 보면 다행히 벤처기업들을 중심으로 이 같 은 플랫폼 구축 움직임이 시작되었으며, 여기에 활용될 데이터 자원을 창출할 수 있는 솔루션 및 특허기술 들 역시 속속 등장하고 있다. 시민들이 재난현장을 스마트폰으로 실시간 공유하면 이 스마트 데이터들이 이미지 및 음향정보, 위치기반(GPS)정보, 시각정보, 3D정보, 빅데이터 정보, 센서정보 등으로 분류되어 플 랫폼 안에서 인공지능(AI) 딥러닝 방식에 의해 분석되고, 이를 즉시 재난당국 및 시민들에게 재난긴급문자 등 자동으로 경보로 전해주는 것이 이 플랫폼의 핵심 기능이다. 몇몇 벤처기업이 보유한 특허기술을 기반 으로 공공자본이 투입되어 이러한 플랫폼이 구축될 경우 국내 재난관리 수준의 획기적 발전은 물론 전 세 계를 시장으로 한 플랫폼 수출 또는 글로벌 재난정보 수집능력에서도 엄청난 힘을 발휘할 것으로 기대된다.",다국어 초록 정보 없음
