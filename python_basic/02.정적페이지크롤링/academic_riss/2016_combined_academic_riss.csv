However, the networks and targets are both limited to the small size due to hardware capability in the past. Modern GPUs have much better calculation capability than CPUs in an order of magnitude now, even though CPUs have become faster. It becomes possible now to train greater and complex neural networks in a shorter time. This paper proposed a method to transform the distribution of original data with a probabilistic neural predictor. Experiments were performed on a feedforward neural network and a recurrent neural network with gated-recurrent units.

한국어 어휘의 어원 연구 - 상고 중국어음을 통한 분석,2016,"['한국어', '상고 중국어', '어휘', '어원학', '무성 비음', 'Korean', 'Old Chinese', 'vocabulary', 'Etymology', 'voiceless nasal']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"About 60 percent of Korean vocabulary is of Chinese origin. The sound of Korean words generally reflects that of Middle Chinese, which was used during the 7–8th centuries in China. However, a few Korean words are derived from the Old Chinese spoken before the second century. Nonetheless, they sound like native Korean words because they sound totally different from Middle and Modern Chinese. In this paper, it was investigated whether a few Korean words came from Old Chinese or not. As a result of this research, it was shown that the Korean words 응달 (shade), 양달 (sunny spot), 가라치 (prison officer), 구렁 (hole), 부엌 (kitchen), 나귀 (donkey), 그믐 (the end of the lunar month) and 굴헝 (alley) may come from Old Chinese. Korean words 음달 [ɯmdar] and 양달 [jaŋdar] may stem from the Old Chinese words 陰地 * jəm diar and 陽地 *yaŋ diar. An Old Korean word 굴헝[kulhəŋ] may stem from an Old Chinese word 巷 *gruŋ. The other Korean words 거러치 [kərəcʰi], 구렁 [kurəŋ], 브[prəg], 그림 [kɯrim], 그믐 [kɯmɯm] and 라귀 [ragwi] may owe their origins to the Old Chinese words 隸 *kʰliəd, *kʰriəd, 坑 *kʰraŋ, 庖 *brəgʷ, 畫 *gʷrik, 晦 *hməg, and 驢駒 *rjiag kjug.

rate of softening and sensitivity for weakly cemented sensitive clays,2016,"['sensitive clay', 'shear band', 'strain softening', 'sensitivity', 'cemented soil', 'vane shear', 'strength loss']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The rate of softening is an important factor to determine whether the failure occurs along localized shear band or in a more diffused manner. In this paper, strength loss and softening rate effect depending on sensitivity are investigated for weakly cemented clays, for both artificially cemented high plasticity San Francisco Bay Mud and low plasticity Yolo Loam. Destructuration and softening behavior for weakly cemented sensitive clays are demonstrated and discussed through multiple vane shear tests. Artificial sensitive clays are prepared in the laboratory for physical modeling or constitutive modeling using a small amount of cement (2 to 5%) with controlled initial water content and curing period. Through test results, shear band thickness is theoretically computed and the rate of softening is represented as a newly introduced parameter, ${\omega}_{80%}$. Consequently, it is found that the softening rate increases with sensitivity for weakly cemented sensitive clays. Increased softening rate represents faster strength loss to residual state and faster minimizing of shear band thickness. Uncemented clay has very low softening rate to 80% strength drop. Also, it is found that higher brittleness index ($I_b$) relatively shows faster softening rate. The result would be beneficial to study of physical modeling for sensitive clays in that artificially constructed high sensitivity (up to $S_t=23$) clay exhibits faster strain softening, which results in localized shear band failure once it is remolded."
in silico identification of bell pepper endornavirus from pepper transcriptomes and their phylogenetic and recombination analyses,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Here, we identified eight Bell pepper endornavirus (BPEV) isolates from nine different pepper transcriptomes. BPEV was present with low copy numbers ranging from 0.01% to 0.18% in the host transcriptome. Phylogenetic identified two different groups of BPEV isolates. Sequence alignment of the five BPEV genomes revealed conservation of the 5' and 3' untranslated regions. Recombination analysis identified two possible recombinant events in the isolate Yolo Wonder. Single nucleotide variation profiles revealed the presence of BPEV variants within a single pepper cultivar. Taken together, this study provides phylogenetic and recombination analyses of the genus Endornavirus using pepper transcriptome data."

In this paper, we propose a model to perform topic segmentation during the progress of the statement with a supervised learning model that uses a convolution neural network.

합성곱 인공 신경망 처리기의 빠른 연산 블록 생성 기법,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"This work addresses the problem of generating a fast arithmetic circuit for each of the node computations of convolutional neural network (CNN). Once a training phase is done in CNN, the computation of each node can be expressed as a sum of multiplications with constant inputs (i.e., with known weights obtained from the training phase). Consequently, we can convert the multiplications into a sum of multiple addends, thereby producing an expression of sum of addends for the node computation, from which we generate a fast carry-save-adder (CSA) implementation structure for the expression. Through gate-level implementation of our proposed technique, we are able to reduce the node computation time by 8.8% on average while a little increase in power consumption, which is mainly caused by our prototyping of incompletely optimized CSA circuits in comparison with the commercial CSAs."

There are various deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks, deep belief networks and recurrent neural networks. Those have been applied to fields like computer vision, automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, audio recognition and bioinformatics where they have been shown to produce state-of-the-art results on various tasks. Among those architectures, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks are classified as the supervised learning model. And in recent years, those supervised learning models have gained more popularity than unsupervised learning models such as deep belief networks, because supervised learning models have shown fashionable applications in such fields mentioned above.  Deep learning models can be trained with backpropagation algorithm. Backpropagation is an abbreviation for “backward propagation of errors” and a common method of training artificial neural networks used in conjunction with an optimization method such as gradient descent. The method calculates the gradient of an error function with respect to all the weights in the network. The gradient is fed to the optimization method which in turn uses it to update the weights, in an attempt to minimize the error function.  Convolutional neural networks use a special architecture which is particularly well-adapted to classify images. Using this architecture makes convolutional networks fast to train. This, in turn, helps us train deep, muti-layer networks, which are very good at classifying images. These days, deep convolutional networks are used in most neural networks for image recognition. Convolutional neural networks use three basic ideas: local receptive fields, shared weights, and pooling. By local receptive fields, we mean that each neuron in the first(or any) hidden layer will be connected to a small region of the input(or previous layer’s) neurons. Shared weights mean that we’re going to use the same weights and bias for each of the local receptive field. This means that all the neurons in the hidden layer detect exactly the same feature, just at different locations in the input image. In addition to the convolutional layers just described, convolutional neural networks also contain pooling layers. Pooling layers are usually used immediately after convolutional layers. What the pooling layers do is to simplify the information in the output from the convolutional layer. Recent convolutional network architectures have 10 to 20 hidden layers and billions of connections between units. Training deep learning networks has taken weeks several years ago, but thanks to progress in GPU and algorithm enhancement, training time has reduced to several hours.  Neural networks with time-varying behavior are known as recurrent neural networks or RNNs. A recurrent neural network is a class of artificial neural network where connections between units form a directed cycle. This creates an internal state of the network which allows it to exhibit dynamic temporal behavior. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal memory to process arbitrary sequences of inputs. Early RNN models turned out to be very difficult to train, harder even than deep feedforward networks. The reason is the unstable gradient problem such as vanishing gradient and exploding gradient. The gradient can get smaller and smaller as it is propagated back through layers. This makes learning in early layers extremely slow. The problem actually gets worse in RNNs, since gradients aren’t just propagated backward through layers, they’re propagated backward through time. If the network runs for a long time, that can make the gradient extremely unstable and hard to learn from. It has been possible to incorporate an idea known as long short-term memory units (LSTMs) into RNNs. LSTMs make it much easier to get good results when traini"

Hébert a publié en 1942 Les Songes en équilibre, et en 1953 Le Tombeau des rois, et ces deux recueils poétiques dessinent avec les mots de révolte et de destruction les femmes québécoises sous le joug de son histoire et de ses valeurs traditionnelles. Les personnages hébertiens croient à “la solitude rompue comme du pain par la poésie”, subissent “l’image renversé” de la réalité comme “les pê̂cheurs d’eau qui prend l’oiseau dans leurs filets mouillés”, et prennnent en vain le chemin vers le salut catholique en mettant leur “coeur au poing comme un faucon aveugle”.Dans la poésie coréenne les poètes féminins tels que Kim Seung-Hee et Kim Hye-Soon nous parlent par excellence des femmes à la recherche de leurs identités qu’on a perdues durant l’histoire contemporaine de la Corée. Les femmes d’Anne Hébert ressemblent sous des aspects divers à celles que Kim Seung-Hee créent dans Comment sortir publié en 1991 et que Kim Hye-Soon dans Notre cliché négatif en 1990. Dans Comment sortir, recueil influencé, comme le précise la poète elle-mê̂me, par les travaux de Michel Foucault et de Gilles Deleuze, elle montre qu’il faut rompre les chaî̂nes du désir. Kim Seung-Hee, à l’instar d’autres poètes de sa génération, a connu une longue errance dans les mots de la violence, et elle a su y trouver sa propre force. Dans la poésie de Kim Hye-Soon le paysage se détruit et renaît, dans un nouvel espace, grâce à une écriture qui refuse les normes habituelles. “La lune” représente bien les poèmes consacrés à la destruction du paysage. Nous sommes loin du lyrisme traditionnel : la lune se transforme en vampire, celui de la mort définitive.La poésie d’Anne Hébert construit le labyrinthe de la mort comme en témoigne “Le Tombeau des rois”. Mort faite de mots - des mots qui viennent du fond de la conscience, en même temps que de l’horizon du réel. La poésie débouchera-t-elle, à sa manière, sur une espérace ou un salut ?"

L'analyse permet de décomposer cet itinéraire en trois étapes :Dans une première étape, le personnage de Catherine se contente d'une vie limitée, comme un être restreint dans une famille incomplète et pauvre où règnent le silence et la solitude. Lassée par la difficulté de cette vie, elle se réfugie tantôt dans des rêves nostalgiques tantô̂t dans celui de devenir Cendrillon. Toutefois, ayant le devoir de remplacer sa mère morte subitement, elle n'en perd pas pour autant le sens du réel au sens où elle ne s'enfuit pas dans un monde iréel et ne fait pas non plus le va-et-vient entre le réel et l'irréel.La seconde étape de son itinéraire correspond à sa vie à Paris avec le personnage de Michel (son mari) placée sous le signe d'une entrée dans un tunnel obscur. Désenchantée, elle prend petit à petit conscience du réel, tout en menant sa propre vie : elle établit son propre espace non seulement physique, mais également psychologique face à l'espace fermé que forment son mari et sa belle-soeur dans le petit appartement composé de deux chambres de bois. Ces chambres de bois deviennent pour Catherine un sombre tombeau, puis se font le symbole d'un enfer où elle doit lutter, dans un système familial patriarcal, contre un mari autoritaire et sadique et sa belle-soeur qui se montre hostile.La troisième étape est constituée de sa prise de conscience définitive à la fois du réel et d'elle-même. Ne pouvant plus supporter la réalité d'une vie où elle ne se retrouve pas, elle quitte les chambres de bois et son mari pour la campagne française. Elle choisit sa liberté et veut être l'auteur de sa vie, décide de suivre ses désirs et ses instincts les plus primitifs, en optant pour une vie parmi les hommes, proche de la nature. C'est par elle-même et non dans la religion qu'elle trouve son salut.Il faudra remarquer que le cadre du roman, représenté tantôt par une campagne de France tantôt par Paris, n'empêche pas d'évoquer la région du Québec. Si les personnages principaux des autres romans ou nouvelles d'Anne Hébert sont souvent des victimes, soit de la violence familiale ou soiciale, soit de la violence patriarcale, le personnage de Catherine des Chambres de bois incarne et annonce, au contraire, une femme nouvelle, positive et idéale dans la société québécoise en décadence des années 50 où règnaient le gouvernement conservateur de Duplessis et l'église catholique autoritaire et fermée."

It is a start point from the question “What is self?” And, if there is a wholistic self, what is it and how to get or recover it? Here are many arguments about the understanding of self; David J. Wallin’s psychological understanding, John R. Searle’s philosophical, H. Richard Niebuhr’s ethical, and Paul Tillich’s theological understanding of self. From these arguments, this article points out the limitations and problems from the understanding of the concept of self. In this article, above all, it is the wholistic self that we help people seek in our dehumanized society which is the one-sided or separated understanding of self.  Therefore, this article will be focused on the concept of “holistic” or “holism” which means ‘health,’ ‘healing.’ and ‘holy,’ originated from Greek word, “holos.” In particular, dealing with the spiritual self in the biblical understanding, it is said the understanding of Thomas Merton’s wholistic self in terms of distinguishing from “the false self” and “the true self.” In addition, in order to get or recover the wholistic self is to need “the learning self.” It is coined by the concept of “the emergent self” from Adrian van Kaam, Bert van Croonenburg, and Susan Annette Muto’s understanding of self. Park J. Palmer, spiritualist and educator, is also introduced in this article as an educational approach to the spiritual direction by/through prayer. Accordingly, this article concludes with a suggestion on the necessity of the spiritual direction and education for getting or recovering the wholistic self."
evaluation of transmission quality of visible light communication using bit error rate measurement,2016,"['bit error rate test (BERT)', 'visible light communication (VLC)', 'signal to noise ratio (SNR)']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In this paper, a bit error rate testing system has been developed and the transmission quality of visible light communication was studied.

This result indicates that the developed system is applicable in indoor communication. A bit error rate clearly became worse when the disturbance light was inserted. The results showed that this testing system is possible to evaluate quantitatively the effect of disturbance light. Signal to noise ratio (SNR) at the input of comparator was calculated, and measured bit error rate was plotted versus SNR. However, a difference between measurement and theoretical curve was observed. To reduce this difference, the review of noise source and the improvement of the mounting method for transmitter/receiver, will be required."

The voltammetric study of the oxidation of amoxicillin has been investigated. It has been obtained that the oxidation of amoxicillin is controlled by both adsorption and diffusion processes. Moreover, the oxidation of amoxicillin occurs via direct and indirect processes in free or electrolyte containing chlorides. Through preparative electrolysis, enhancement of amoxicillin oxidation was observed in the presence of chloride where the amoxicillin degradation yield reached more than 50 % compared to less than 5% in the absence of chlorides.

olig2 is expressed late in human eosinophil development and controls siglec-8 expression,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that binds to E-box motifs, is known to have a key role in determining lineage specification of oligodendrocytes and motor neurons. In the present study, we report that oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 is expressed in human eosinophils and involved in transcriptional activation of the gene encoding sialic acid binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 8 (Siglec-8), a late eosinophil-differentiation marker known to exert eosinophil apoptosis. When cord blood CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells differentiated toward eosinophils during a 24-d culture period, oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 protein was expressed in cord blood eosinophils on d 24, a time when cord blood eosinophils are considered fully differentiated, whereas it was not detectable on d 18 or at earlier time points. Oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 protein was also abundantly expressed in human peripheral-blood eosinophils but not in neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, or cord blood mast cells. RNA sequencing analysis showed that numerous genes, especially those encoding eosinophil surface molecules, were highly up-regulated along with OLIG2. Among the genes examined, SIGLEC-8 messenger RNA and protein were markedly downregulated in parallel with OLIG2 by an oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 small interfering RNA or a short hairpin RNA, as evidenced by real-time polymerase chain reaction, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and Western blot analyses. In reporter gene and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, an E-box in the first intron was found to stimulate SIGLEC-8 gene transcription and to bind oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2. Hence, at least one important aspect of eosinophil differentiation is regulated by oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2, a transcription factor that has not previously been reported, to our knowledge, in normal granulocytes.</P>"
persistent asymmetric structure of sagittarius a* on event horizon scales,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The Galactic Center black hole Sagittarius. A* (Sgr A*) is a prime observing target for the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), which can resolve the 1.3 mm emission from this source on angular scales comparable to that of the general relativistic shadow. Previous EHT observations have used visibility amplitudes to infer the morphology of the millimeter-wavelength emission. Potentially much richer source information is contained in the phases. We report on 1.3 mm phase information on Sgr. A* obtained with the EHT on a total of 13 observing nights over four years. Closure phases, which are the sum of visibility phases along a closed triangle of interferometer baselines, are used because they are robust against phase corruptions introduced by instrumentation and the rapidly variable atmosphere. The median closure phase on a triangle including telescopes in California, Hawaii, and Arizona is nonzero.

asymmetric hysteresis for probing dzyaloshinskii–moriya interaction,2016,['Dzyaloshinskii&#x2212'],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is intimately related to the prospect of superior domain wall dynamics and the formation of magnetic skyrmions. Although some experimental efforts have been recently proposed to quantify these interactions and the underlying physics, it is still far from trivial to address the interfacial DMI. Inspired by the reported tilt of the magnetization of the side edge of a thin film structure, we here present a quasi-static, straightforward measurement tool. By using laterally asymmetric triangular-shaped microstructures, it is demonstrated that interfacial DMI combined with an in-plane magnetic field yields a unique and significant shift in magnetic hysteresis. By systematic variation of the shape of the triangular objects combined with a droplet model for domain nucleation, a robust value for the strength and sign of interfacial DMI is obtained. This method gives immediate and quantitative access to DMI, enabling a much faster exploration of new DMI systems for future nanotechnology.</P>"
존 스타인벡의 『하늘 목장』: 성공에 대한 미국의 전통적 시각,2016,"['John Steinbeck', 'Pastures of Heaven', 'Nirvana', 'moksha', 'non-teleological philosophy']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This study aims to analyze John Steinbeck's earliest published work, The Pastures of Heaven, which is a collection of stories about the inhabitants of a fertile valley in California. This novel consists of short stories that describe particular times and places within the valley. Everyone in the valley including the main character, the Bert Munroes is trying to seek the quest for his own happiness. In fact, the world Steinbeck describes in each of these stories is fraught with barriers that are erected largely by misguided human perceptions.Thus, in this study as Steinbeck’s non-teleological philosophy accords with several other Eastern cosmological precepts as well, I analyzed each character from Eastern philosophical and religious traditions including Hinduism and Buddhism related to Steinbeck's non-teleological philosophy. I thus applied Eastern ideas such as maya, lila, karma, and moksha in the procedure of the quest of happiness which characters seek. In a wide range of views, analyzing this work through the views for Eastern traditions elucidates much insufficiency of the American vision. Therefore, I think what Steinbeck intends in this work is to bring the spiritual imagination of the American mind to the crisis of America to face its inevitable destiny. (Jeonju University)"

Ils ont mis en relief l'acte du personnage principal de soeur Julie, nonne et sorcière, pour se libérer et pour détruire les institutions cruelles et réprssives représentées par le couvent où elle se trouve.Dans cette étude, nous avons abordé ce roman d'un autre point de vue, parce qu'il nous semble que la recherche de la liberté authentique de Julie a échoué. C'est que Julie, qui a tant voulu échapper à un monde de violence familiale et religieuse, finit par entrer dans un autre monde de violence. Ce cercle vicieux de la violence dans la vie de Julie est ananlysé sous trois aspects : la famille, le couvent et le défoulement.D'abord, la famille de Julie et de son frère est une famille aliénée par la société et par les gens qui l'entourent. Philomène, leur mère, est une sorcière qui organise avec son mari, Adélard, un sabbat les soirs de pleine lune. N'ayant ni instinct maternel ni instinct paternel, ces parents laissent des blessures profondes à leurs enfants. Le père viole sa fille au cours d'un sabbat et continue à la violer ouvertement, tandis que la mère est sur le point de violer son fils au cours d' une céremonie incestueuse qu'elle organise. La famille devient donc un enfer où est née la névrose du personnage principal de Julie.Ensuite, le couvent où est entreé Julie pour s'échapper définitivement de la vie cauchemardesque de son enfance se révèle être un autre enfer en lui imposant une discipline autoritaire, répressive et déshumanisante. Ni la mère supérieure ni l'aumônier ni le docteur, très autoritaires, ne font montre de compréhension de l'état psychololgique et des symptômes névrotiques de soeur Julie. Lorsque se succèdent quelques phénomènes surnaturels provoqués par Julie, ils ne cherchent qu'à l'exorciser et la chasser du couvent. Loin de guérir la névrose de Julie et de sauver son âme, le couvent et ses responsable aggravent cette névrose.Enfin, Julie ne supporte plus la vie au couvent et elle se forge un espace de défoulement. Revivant sa vie passé par des souvenirs ainsi que des visions et ravivant la sorcellerie qu'elle s'était initiée auparavant, elle est de plus en plus encline à la haine et au désir de destructiion. Elle met ainsi en désarroi le couvent et rend les responsables de celui-ci impuissants, inutiles et même diaboliques. Bien que ses actes soient symboliques d'une révolte contre les institutiions autoritaires et sclérosées du Québec des annés trente et quarante, ils procèdent d'un objectif aussi anachronique qu'autodestructif. C'est qu'elle souhaite devenir une sorcière brûlée vivante comme sa mère l'a été, voire plus aboutie. Pour ce faire, elle se propose de marier son propre frère et, pis encore, son fils qui sera tué dés sa naissance par la mère supérieure du couvent et l'aumonier.Ainsi, malgré ses efforts pour s'émanciper des deux enfers distincts de sa vie, Julie ne parvient pas à trouver la voie pour se reconstruire une vie de sorcière positive, ou de dirigeante révolutionnaire d'une classe aliénée. Elle rentre dans le monde de la violence du sabbat inauthentique et c'est bien là ce qui constitue le cercle vicieux de sa tragédie."

However, the large-signal models provided by the foundry service cannot guarantee model accuracy up to frequencies close to their maximum oscillation frequency (Fmax). Generally, the optimum output load point of a PA varies severely according to frequency, which creates difficulties in generating watt-level output power through the octave bandwidth. This study overcomes these issues by the development of in-house large-signal models that include a thermal model and by applying distributed L-C output load matching to reactive matched amplifiers. The proposed GaN PAs have successfully accomplished output power over 5 W through the octave bandwidth."

The FGM is assumed to be formed from ceramic and metal phases with their volume fraction vary in the thickness direction by a power-law function. A bilinear elastoplastic behavior is assumed for the metallic phase, and the effective elastoplastic properties of the FGM are evaluated by Tamura-Tomota-Ozawa (TTO) model. Based on the classical beam theory, a nonlinear finite beam element taking the shift in the neutral axis position into account is formulated and employed in the investigation. An incremental-iterative procedure in combination with the arc-length control method is employed in computing the equilibrium paths of the beams. The validation of the formulated element is confirmed by comparing the equilibrium paths obtained by using the present element and the one available in the literature. The numerical results show that the elastoplastic post-buckling of the FGM beams is unstable, and the post-buckling strength is higher for the beams associated with a higher ceramic content. Different from homogeneous beams, yielding in the FGM beam occurs in the layer near the ceramic layer before in the layer near metal surface.

This article introduces a class of radial retractable roofs based on the foldable bar structure (FBS) mechanism. A radial retractable roof structure whose moveable section consisted of 6 segments and 6 rigid linkages was designed with appropriate parameters. An experimental study of a radial retractable roof was carried out. A scale model with a 3 metre diameter was constructed to study the roof deflection and vibration during the deployment process under four different load cases. Furthermore, based on the multi-flexible body dynamics theory, an ADAMS-ANSYS co-simulation was applied to simulate the motion process of the radial retractable roof structure. The experimental results were consistent with the numerical simulations. This indicates that the dynamic and fluctuation phenomena of structural behaviour are universal. The structural vibration was increased with the increase of external loads, and the vibration amplitude increased significantly when the roof was starting and braking. With the closing of the movable roof, the deflection of the fixed roof increased significantly. In the motion process, the bending moment of the fixed roof gradually increases, while that of the moving roof varies little. Vertical vibration is significant in the motion process by reason of the complex wheel-rail contact."

However, detecting faces in the wild is still a challenging task due to the wide range of variations in pose, scale, and occlusions. Recently, many deep learning methods have been proposed for face detection. However, further improvements are required in the wild. Another important issue to be considered in the face detection is the computational complexity. Current state-of-the-art deep learning methods require a large number of patches to deal with varying scales and the arbitrary image sizes, which result in an increased computational complexity.To reduce the complexity while achieving better detection accuracy, we propose a fully convolutional network-based face detection that can take arbitrarily-sized input and produce feature maps (heat maps) corresponding to the input image size. To deal with the various face scales, a multi-scale network architecture that utilizes the facial components when learning the feature maps is proposed. On top of it, we design multi-task learning technique to improve detection performance. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the FDDB dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with the accuracy of 82.33% at 517 false alarms, while improving computational efficiency significantly."

This task was done manually by humans which is a waste of human resources. Current systems that are employed for automatic extraction of characters require a constant source of illumination, a certain pattern, and a fixed camera angle. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) promises a high recognition rate of 99% for optical character recognition and outputs stable results even in varying environmental conditions. Therefore, this paper implements CNN for the estimation of the character region. For color classification in industries, the color strongly depends on the concentration of the paint and the illumination conditions. The first problem is the misclassification of the chromatic color to another unique color and the neighboring hue of the chromatic color when the brightness and chroma are low in the RGB color space. This paper uses a feed forward neural network to solve the first issue of color classification. The color of an object is perceived by the ray of light that it reflects. When this light color changes, the color of the object looks different. This attributes to the second problem in which the perception of colors varies with the change in the illumination color of the light source. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes to implement CNN for the approximation of the color of the light source."

Moreover, computation time depends on model and image crop size, but precision is also affected; usually, time and precision have trade-off relation. By adjusting input image size in spite of downgrading performance, computation time meets criteria for one model. Therefore, selection of a model is one of the important problems when faster R-CNN based object detection system for an autonomous robot is constructed. In this paper, we convert several state-of-the-art models from convolution neural network (CNN) for image classification.

improving discrimination ability of convolutional neural networks by hybrid learning,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The discrimination of similar patterns is important because they are the major sources of the classification error. This paper proposes a novel method to improve the discrimination ability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by hybrid learning. The proposed method embeds a collection of discriminators as well as a recognizer in a shared CNN. By visualizing contrastive class saliency, we show that learning with embedded discriminators leads the shared CNN to detect and catch the differences among similar classes. Also proposed is a hybrid learning algorithm that learns recognition and discrimination together. The proposed method learns recognition focusing on the differences among similar classes, and thereby improves the discrimination ability of the CNN. Unlike conventional discrimination methods, the proposed method does not require predefined sets of similar classes or additional step to integrate its result with that of the recognizer. In experiments on two handwritten Hangul databases SERI95a and PE92, the proposed method reduced classification error from 2.56 to 2.33, and from 4.04 to 3.66% respectively.

We extend the Skip-gram model to learn multiple sense embeddings for the word types, catering to introduce sense-based embeddings for CNN during sentiment classification. Instead of using the pipeline method to learn multiple sense embeddings of a word type, the sense discrimination and sense embedding learning for each word type are performed jointly based upon the semantics of its contextual words. We validate the effectiveness of the method on the commonly used datasets. Experiment results show that our method are able to improve the quality of sentiment classification when comparing with several competitive baselines."

As a result, the proposed IMP CNN can achieve insensitivity to spectral variations characteristic of different speakers and utterances.

A sequence of rigorous activities under certain constraints is followed to come up with reliable software. Various measures are taken during the process of software development to ensure high quality software. One such method is software module fault prediction for quality assurance to discover defects in the software prior to testing. It aids in predicting the software module faults earlier in the development of the software which predicts fault prone modules so that these can be given special attention to avoid any future risk which eventually curbs the testing along with maintenance cost and effort. The literature survey uncovers many findings that had never been focused like dimensionality reduction and feature selection based on individual feature importance which leads to increase in time complexity and chances of false information. This paper addresses these issues and proposes a supervised machine learning based software module fault prediction technique by implementing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as classifier model. Feature selection methods used are InfoGain and Correlation. The results obtained are compared with the existing method HySOM (SOM Clustering with Artificial Neural Network Classification) by considering three different feature sets (Fifteen features, Eighteen features and Twenty one features) of PC1 dataset from NASA. The comparative analysis is performed on the basis of accuracy, precision, recall and F1-measure. The results clearly show better performance of the proposed CNN based technique than HySOM. This paper will contribute towards improvement of quality assurance models utilized for software fault prediction by automating this process using machine learning which enhances True Positive Rate and reduces the detection error. This in turn will help project managers, testers and developers to locate and keep track of fault prone modules so that final software is more accurate, consistent and reliable without consuming much of the testing and maintenance resources."

The people who lived in the most damaged areas were mainly poor, low-income working class African-Americans. They are the disposable people, or what Zygmunt Bauman names the human waste in the age of neoliberalism. Hurricane Katrina was a second chance for the local politicians and the business elite of the city. In contrast to their neoliberal reconstruction of the city, Treme foregrounds the autonomous practices of ordinary people’s efforts to recover what they lost. Here the city’s unique culture matters most. Treme portrays various characters’ struggles and lives after the storm. This paper explores how their culturally driven lifestyles can be an example of Hardt and Negri’s biopolitical production, which aims to create a new form of life. This paper concludes that what Treme eventually projects to us is a vision for a form of life, which diverges from the dominant neoliberal lifestyle and subjectivity."

In this paper, we will propose a new mass-spring model for a fishing-net and also a method to simplify the equations for the real-time simulation of a fishing-net model. Our 3D mass-spring model will show the mesh-structure similar with the other mass-spring model except that each intersection point can have independently a different mass. The motion of each mass will be calculated with adding dynamics. To reduce the calculation time, we will try to simplify the mathematical equations which consider the tidal-current and buoyancy.

We empirically describe these issues with data of which each net growth of single and multiple products(=bundled) was gathered by real industry of South Korea where there is overheated competition on their oligopoly market. We found strong evidences that through network effects, not only installed base was significantly associated with corporate finance such as total sales, total assets, and EBITDA, but also the difference between product types and size of installed base in single and multiple products was significant in a competitive market. As a result, our evidence provides an important explanation with operating firms currently.

‘텍스트언어학적’ 시 분석을 위한 기고,2016,"['Textualität', 'Metatextualität', 'Gedichtanalyse', '텍스트성', '메타텍스트성', '시분석']","‘어떤 (텍스트로 판단되기 이전의) 임의적 발화가 텍스트로 간주되는 일반적 조건들이 존재하는가?’라는 물음은 텍스트언어학의 초창기인 1960년대 중반부터 줄곧 제기되어온 텍스트언어학의 핵심 문제인 ‘텍스트성 Textualität’과 관련된다. 텍스트언어학의 중요저작 중의 하나인 Beaugrande와 Dressler의 『텍스트언어학 입문 Einführung in die Textlinguistik』(1981)의 핵심은 이러한 텍스트성의 규명에 있다. 여기서는 텍스트언어학 초기 무렵에 중요 관심사였던 일련의 문장 연쇄로서의 텍스트가 아닌, ‘하나의 통합적 총체로서의 텍스트 성격이 무엇인가’라는 물음에 대한 대답이 관건이다. 이러한 ‘텍스트성’과는 달리 다소 생소해 보이는 ‘메타텍스트성 Metatextualität’은 독일 뮌스터대학의 텍스트언어학자인 Brinkmann의 제자로서 텍스트언어학의 역사에서 나름대로의 위치(‘해석학적 텍스트언어학 hermeneutische Textlinguistik’ 방향)를 차지하고 있는 Scherner에 의해 다듬어진 용어이다. 그는 자신의 독일 뮌스터대학교 퇴임고별강연(2005년) 「텍스트에서 계속하기. 텍스트성에서 메타텍스트성으로 Weiter im Text. Von der Textualität zur Metatextualität」에서 Genette의 용어를 빌어 이 개념을 좀 더 구체적으로 규정지었다. “문학 텍스트와 문학텍스트의 해석 사이에 존재하는 관계”(Scherner 2005, 20)를 출발점으로 삼는 메타텍스트성은 기존의 문예학적 연구 대상물을 문예 비평에만 머무르게 하지 않고 (텍스트)언어학으로 끌어들인 것에서 큰 의의를 찾을 수 있다. 1차 텍스트인 문학텍스트와 그것에 대한 해석인 2차 텍스트 사이의 ‘의의연속성 Sinnkontinuität’ 이 개념은 코헤렌쯔를 설명하기 위해 Beaugrande/Dressler(1981, 88)가 Hörmann(1976)의 심리언어학적 용어인 “의의의 항상성 Sinnkonstanz”라는 용어에서 착안한 것이다. 생물학에서, “생명체가 여러 가지 환경 변화나 스트레스에 대응하여 내부를 일정하게 유지하려 하는 조절 과정 또는 그 상태를 ‘항상성’이라고 한다. homeostasis(항상성)에서 homeo의 의미는 same(동일한, 똑같은)이고, stasis의 의미는 standing(유지하다)의 뜻으로 ‘동일하게 유지하다’라는 용어의 조합이다. 항상성의 예로 체온 조절, 삼투압 조절, 혈당량 조절 등을 들 수 있는데, 생명체의 기능이 효율적으로 일어나 생명을 유지하기 위해서는 체온, pH, 삼투압 등 생화학 성분을 포함해 다른 체내 환경이 항상 어떤 범위 안에서 유지되는 것이 필요하다. 이를 조절하는 과정이 ‘항상성 유지’이다.” (개념톡톡 용어사전 http://100.daum.net/encyclopedia/view/ 39XXX8800009).을 지칭하는 메타텍스트성은 상호텍스트성 Intertextualität과 관련지을 수도 있다. 그러나 문예학에서의 출발한 상호텍스트성 개념은 너무나도 복잡하고, 또한 텍스트언어학에서는 이 개념이 종종 ‘지시 Referenz’ 개념으로 이해(또는 오해)되어 크게 각광을 받지 못했다(Scherner 2005, 20 참조). 그럼에도 불구하고 텍스트언어학에서는 Scherner 등에 의해서 이 방향의 연구가 계속되어 왔는데, 본 연구의 최종 목적은 이러한 메타텍스트성의 비교 분석에 향해있다. 이를 위해, 소위 텍스트언어학적 분석 방법을 적용해서 박목월의 시 「나그네」를 분석한 고영근, 이석규 외와 Kirsch의 「외눈으로 Einäugig」를 분석한 Weinrich의 소위 ‘텍스트언어학적’ 시 텍스트 분석 방법론을 비교하여 시 텍스트 분석의 일반화에 조금이라고 기여할 수 있는 방법론을 구성 ...","R.-A. de Beaugrande/W.

The current benefits include training subsidies and income support for workers who have exhausted their unemployment insurance. In addition, TAA - eligible workers who are age 50 and over and obtain reemployment at a lower wage may be eligible for a wage insurance program (RTAA) and the Health Coverage Tax Credit (72.5%) is also provided. From the analysis of the U.S. system, several policy implications for the TAA system of Korea are found. Firstly, the social safety net including employment insurance system should be extended toward the direction of providing effective assistance which help workers adapt themselves to the globalized economic environment by enhancing the assistance programs such as the training assistance and relocation or reemployment, rather than providing additional special benefits to the workers who have been suffered from foreign trade. the Secondly, the interests of workers such as the protection of employment should be considered not only in the trade adjustment assistance system for workers but also in that for the firms which is comparatively given a lot of weight in the Korean system. Thirdly, the eligibility of the designated trade adjustment workers which is higher than that of the U.S. system should be less strict given that the Korean system does not provide any direct financial support for those workers unlike the U.S. system, and also it is necessary to find ways to secure diversity and effectiveness of the training program for relocation or reemployment service in order to meet timely the social needs for workforce."

Similar to empirical evidence in the U.S., we find s strong pattern of positive returns during the overnight period followed by negative returns during the trading day. When we use net buying by individual investors as a percent of total trading volume yesterday as a proxy for individual investor attention at the start of trading day, we find that the higher this measure of attention is, the stronger is the intensity of individual investors’ net buying at the open. Furthermore, the magnitude of intraday return reversal is larger for stocks with higher measure of individual investor attention. These findings are consistent with the attention hypothesis, and we also find that our main results are robust to using Fama-McBeth regressions and controlling for U.S stock market returns on the previous day."

Specifically, the median absolute forecast errors and Theil’s U-stat decrease as the reputation rank increases in all three future performance measures (net income, cash flows from operations, and free cash flows). This implies that firms with reputational capital provide high quality financial reporting.Thus we interpret the results as suggesting that a firm’s reputation increases the estimating power of accounting estimates in estimating the firm’s performance."

p2p cloud network services for iot based disaster situations information,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>In order to cope with disaster situations properly, it is very important to identify the disaster scale and provide the accurate information of the site to the appropriate authorities including disaster site and Central Disaster Management Center, on-site command post, etc. and share the information provided. In particular, sharing information on disaster situations should control the disaster quickly to prevent the disaster situation from lasting and expanding. However, in the event of a large-scale disaster, delay is caused in the existing commercial network and therefore, the disaster situation cannot be communicated quickly and accurately. In order to determine the situation exactly in the event of a disaster, safety and connectivity of the network and flow of data are very important. Even if the stability of the network and connection of nodes are resolved in the network of each agency business operator, it is necessary to share the platform between networks for IoT/M2M communication for the smooth flow of data. Recently, the disaster safety net of combining existing disaster standard technology with Ubiquitous Technology and Smart IT such as Tetra of Europe, iDEN of the U.S., etc. has been built for disaster safety communications. In addition, systems useful for demand-centered, site-centered immediate disaster response by using Mobile, SNS, cloud computing, etc. are being built and designed to play an important role in the disaster information system especially through IoT, P2P cloud network, big data, etc. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed the P2P cloud network service for IoT based disaster situations information according to the paradigm of the changing times. The proposed service is to combine IoT/M2M network with P2P cloud service for rapid and smooth response in the event of a disaster and provide the results as social services such as SNS. To this end, the wide area wireless disaster information network system has been built in the local and each local network is connected to each other to provide disaster situations by using the server of the disaster area. At this time, each server was to be interconnected via P2P network and to be connected automatically by software-based network in P2P Cloud System. Also, the cognitive cycle was applied for selecting optimal wireless link and router of P2P Cloud-based Disaster Information Network and the danger situations of the disaster area were to be provided to the user by configuring disaster information component for providing services and building central disaster information platform managing it.</P>"
중동의 지정학적 리스크가 에너지 시장에 미친 영향,2016,"['Geopolitical Risk', 'Event Study Analysis', 'Crude Oil Price', 'Energy Supply', '지정학적 리스크', '사건분석 모형', '국제유가', '공급 불안']","본 연구는 중동의 지정학적 리스크(Geopolitical Risk)가 국제유가 등 에너지 시장에 미친 영향을 분석했다. 지정학적 리스크는 정정 불안 등 예상치 못한 비경제적인 요인으로 인해 글로벌 경제와 기업 경영에 주는 위험을 의미한다. 자스민 혁명으로 시작되어 리비아, 이집트 등으로 전이된 MENA사태, 2012년 이란의 핵개발 제재에 따른 호르무즈 해협의 군사적 긴장, 2014년 IS의 이라크 북부 장악으로 인한 이라크 사태 등 3가지 중동의 지정학적 리스크의 영향을 분석했다. 지정학적 불안이 발생하면 에너지 생산 감소와 물류 차질이 발생해 공급 불안이 생긴다. 사건분석(Event Study) 모형 분석 결과, 지정학적 리스크는 국제유가를 상승시키는 요인으로 작용하나 그 영향의 정도는 언론 등에서 예상하는 것과는 달리 제한적이었다. 2011년 MENA 사태 때는 국제유가의 2개월 누적 순 가격 변동은 5.2%, 2012년 이란 사태 때는 4.3%, 2014년 이라크 사태 때는 1.4%에 그쳤다. 지정학적 리스크의 영향력이 약해진 것은 미국, 러시아 등 공급이 다변화되었기 때문이다. 따라서 IS 등에 의해 중동에 불안이 발생하더라도 저유가가 상당 기간 지속될 가능성이 크다.","This paper analyzed the effects of geopolitical risks in the Middle East on energy markets including the crude oil price. Geopolitical risk means the danger imposed upon the global economy and corporate management due to unexpected uneconomic factors such as political instabilities. Three geopolitical risks dealt with in the paper are turmoils in Libya and Egypt caused by Arab Spring, military tension in Hormuz caused by fortified sanctions on Iran, instability in Iraq caused by IS’s occupation on Northern part of Iraq. If geopolitical instability occurred energy supply would be disrupted because of energy production reduction and logistics setbacks. According to estimation results using Event Study analysis, the geopolitical risks acted as the factor increasing the oil price but the extent of the effect was much less than the expectation of the media or other practical articles. Net change of oil price for 2 months just after the commotions of MENA in 2011 was 5.17%, and those after the conjunctions of Iran in 2012 and Iraq in 2014 were 4.31% and 1.39%, respectively. This result is mainly because the energy supply sources such as U.S. and Russia have been diversified. Therefore low oil price would continue with considerable time even if geopolitical instabilities by IS, etc in the Middle East are kept on."
the stock price relevance of accounting information for the companies designated as “issues for the administration” according to the causes of designation :application of propensity score matching,2016,"['value relevance of accounting information', 'issue for administration', 'Ohlson Model', 'propensity score matching']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The purpose of this research is to examine the stock price relevance of accounting information for the companies designated as “Issues for Administration” in the KOSPI market of South Korea. First, the value relevance of accounting information was compared between the designated companies and non－designated companies from five years prior to designation. Second, the value relevance of accounting information was compared according to the causes of designation－financial causes and non－financial causes. Third, as additional analyses, the value relevance of accounting information was compared for the sample in which designated companies were 1 to 1 matched with non－designated by propensity score matching method.The value relevance of accounting information was analyzed by the basic Ohlson model and the extended Ohlson model, which includes debts ratio and size as additional variables to the basic Ohlson model.The 174 designated non－financial firms are sampled out of the firms listed on the KOSPI between 2003 and 2015. The stock price relevance of designated companies which were disclosed as “Issue for Administration” in the Korea Investors’ Network for Disclosure System (http://kind.krx.co.kr) was compared with that of the non－designated companies(n＝7, 081).For the non－designated companies, the accounting information(EPS, Book Value, Size, and Debt ratio) has significant effect on the stock price during all the years, and the debt ratio affects the stock price in the reversed U－shape. However, for the designated companies, the basic model was insignificant in t－4 year, and only BPS and size had effects on the stock price. The value relevance of accounting information between the designated companies and the non－designated companies was different.The value relevance of accounting information was slightly different as the causes of designation－financial causes and non－financial causes. The EPS and debt ratio has no effect on the stock price in both groups while the size has significant effect in both groups. And the net book value showed difference between the financial and the non－financial cause group.When the designated companies were matched with non－designated companies by propensity score, the results were a little different from non－matched sample. In the non－designated group, only BPS and Size were significant while EPS and Debt ratio had no effect on the stock price. The value relevance of accounting information was different between the designated companies and non－designated companies.Considering these results, the value relevance of accounting information is different in the designated companies and the non－designated companies, and the value relevance of accounting information also varies according to the causes of designation. It is needed for control group to have more elaborate sampling methods in order to avoid the sampling bias in further studies."

(KTL henceforth) was established in 1997 as a software developer. At initial stage, KTL successfully developed networksecurity software and grow rapidly as internet was widely used and homepage became popular in the late 1990’s. As a successful venture enterprise, the firm was listed in KOSDAQ market in 2001. After the listing, the firm expand its business areas to anti-terrorism equipments, related education and consulting, nutritional supplement delivery system, and clothing shopping mall. In addition, KTL started operations in Japan and China. Although KTL pursued aggressive expansion strategy, KTL’s new attempts turned out unsuccessful. The firm’s operating performance was getting deteriorated and the firm actually suffered continuing losses from its operation and new investment. The firm changed its name when the management switched its main business to another. After all, the post-audit review performed by Korean Financial Supervisory Service revealed that KTL committed accounting fraud to inflate firm performance. The management also committed misappropriation and malpractice. As a result, the firm was delisted eventually. KTL was revealed to have overstated short-term loan, sales to the related parties, account receivables and inventory. The firm asserted that the sales of security equipment occurred via the related party located in Japan and considerable inventories were also kept in Japan. However, all the assertions of the management were found to be false. The sales through related parties were fictitious and the inventory did not exist in Japan. Moreover, the firm did not recognize impairment losses from long-term investment asset and intangible asset. Overall, KTL understated net loss amount by 44.4% in 2008, 8.7% in 2009, and 79.4% in 2010. After reflecting all the adjustments, net asset of KTL decreases from 45,550 million won in 2008 to 15,254 million won in 2010. Throughout the 3 years, adjusted sales were all below 3,000 million won which is the amount of criteria for judging delisting. In spite of such a serious problem inherent in financial statement reporting, two audit firms that audited KTL for 2008 and 2009 failed to find out the accounting fraud and did not perform quality audit. Although the two audit firms recognized that KTL experienced consecutive operating losses and was under the pressure of delisting, they did not conduct appropriate audit process. First, they ignored the importance of audit risk assessment which reflects the risk of business, accounting system, and internal control of the client firm. If they have assessed audit risk as high and thus reflect the risk in the audit process, they would expand audit scope and increase substantive tests. Second, they did not evaluate collectibility of loan and did not assess its collateral, which enables KTL to overstate its short-term loan. Third, the auditors did not focus on abnormally large transactions with related parties and thus miss fictitious sales. In addition, they did not confirm the existence of inventory in Japan. Although the inventory was in the foreign country, the auditors should have request cooperation of accounting firms in Japan to confirm the existence of inventory if the amount of inventory was significant. Lastly, the audit firms did not review financial statement of investee to assess the long-term equity investment and intangible asset(sales right). At that time, the operating performance of investee located in U.S. was deteriorated and the operation of main production facilities was already stopped in 2010. But, the auditors did not notice the facts and just accept the amount of equity investment suggested by KTL. Through this case, students can understand the deteriorating process of a venture firm and accounting frauds occurred in the process. More specifically, students are able to learn the ways that the management of KTL used to commit accounting fraud and why audit firms fail to find the fraud. Also, students can find out features of external audit of small and medium-sized firms. Even though the management of small and medium-sized firms are more likely to commit misappropriation and malpractice, and thus exposed to higher audit risk, auditors tend to input relatively smaller audit efforts due to the small audit fees of such clients. From this case, we need to perceive the importance of thorough audit risk assessment for small and medium-sized firms, sufficient audit efforts based on the assessed audit risk, and the realization of audit fees to support the enough audit efforts."

The Korean commentators and courts have long viewed the Korean Civil Code §741 as a fundamental principle governing all types of unjust enrichment and provided the four-factor test based on the provision, which is for determining whether or not the defendant has unjust enrichment. According to their theories, the loss as one of those four factors plays a role to restrict the defendant's liability to restitution because the value of benefits being defined unjust enrichment is not more than the plaintiff's loss. Consequently, the defendant who is enriched by the misconduct may keep the wrongful gain in excess of the plaintiff's loss. In the same matter, however, the U.S. Law of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment approves the disgorgement remedy, which allows the plaintiff to recover the net increase in the assets of the defendant(wrongdoer), to the extent that this increase is attributable to the underlying wrong. The disgorgement disallows any implication that the defendant's wrongful gain must correspond to a loss on the part of the plaintiff. This is based on the policy consideration that stripping the wrongdoer of a wrongful gain is a very effective deterrent for wrongdoers. It is debatable whether the deterrence may be embodied in and harmonized with the Korean law of unjust enrichment. However, defining a resonable scope or liability of restitution is just in any country, and it does not run counter to the purpose of the Korean law of unjust enrichment. Thus, it is not impossible to draw some implication for improving the Korean legal rules of unjust enrichment through the comparison with the U.S. law of restitution and unjust enrichment. Especially, it deserves consideration of the attribution rule and its substandard, for example, causation and remoteness, apportionment, etc in the U.S. law of restitution for wrong."
장학재단의 장학사업 제고를 위한 법제도 및 세제 개선방안,2016,"['장학재단', '장학활동', '출연재산', '기본재산', '보통재산', 'scholarship foundation', 'activities for public interest', 'property contributions', 'fundamental property', 'general property']","우리나라의 장학단체(특히 재단)는 전체 공익단체(종교법인 제외)의 28.7%로 가장 많은 비중을 차지하고 있다. 이들 단체에게는 다른 비영리법인의 경우와 동일하게 여러 세제상의 혜택이 주어지고 있다. 이 논문에서는 장학재단에 대한 세제혜택만큼 장학사업이 제대로 이행되고 있는가를 평가하기 위해 602개 장학법인의 결산서류를 분석하는 한편, 이를 미국 및 일본의 경우와 비교하였다.그 결과 장학금 지급이라는 직접적 지출비중이 주요국에 비해 매우 낮다는 점과 재산을 상당히 비효율적으로 운용하는 것으로 평가되었다. 그 이유는 현행의 장학재단 관련 법제도와 세제가 ‘기본재산’ 유지에만 초점이 맞추어져 있어서 장학재단의 재산적 활동범위를 ‘보통재산’에 한정하는 한편 ‘기본재산’의 처분을 주무관청의 허가로 봉쇄하는 등 재단소유 재산의 대부분을 직접적인 장학금 지급의 재원으로 사용하지 못하도록 하는 것에서 찾을 수 있다.이러한 문제점을 극복하고 장학사업 지출비중을 높이기 위해서는 다음과 같은 개선방안이 요구된다.첫째, 종전 ‘기본재산’의 처분을 자유롭게 허용하여야 한다. 장학재단은 장학사업의 특성상 특별한 시설을 필요로 하지 않아 출연재산의 처분을 엄격하게 규제하여야 할 이유가 없다. ‘기본재산’의 자유로운 처분을 위해서는 출연재산과 ‘기본재산’의 개념을 달리하여야 한다. 이를 위해 출연재산의 최소기준을 법제화하거나 ‘기본재산’을 ‘보통재산’으로 용도변경하기 위한 요건을 크게 완화할 필요가 있다.둘째, ‘기본재산’으로부터 얻어지는 과실소득 즉, ‘보통재산’이 충분히 확보될 수 있도록 해야 한다. 장학활동의 직접적인 재원은 ‘보통재산’이기 때문이다. ‘보통재산’의 경우에도 ‘기본재산’과 같이 설립허가시 출연하한요건을 신설하고, 일정 출연하한요건을 어긴 경우 세제상 불이익을 주는 방법, ‘기본재산’ 과 비교하여 ‘보통재산’의 출연비율이 높을수록 세제상 혜택을 부여하는 방법을 고려하여야 한다.셋째, 장학활동에 대한 지출이 높아지도록 순투자자산 대비 장학활동 지출이 적은 경우에는 미국연방세법상 유보소득 가산세제도와 같은 제재를 가하는 방법, 장학재단의 총비용 중 장학금의 지급금액이 일정비율 이하인 경우 가산세를 부과하거나 손금불산입하는 등의 불이익을 주는 제재방안도 필요하다.선행연구들이 공익법인 전체에 대하여 주로 설립절차의 완화, 공익성 검증을 위한 기관의 설치, 주식출연 한도의 완화 등을 중심적 과제로 다룬 것에 비해 이 논문은 장학재단의 재산처분에 자율성을 보장함으로써 그 공익성을 제고하는 방안을 제시함에 차별성이 있다.","Scholarship organization occupies the largest share with 28.7% of the overall public interest organizations except religious corporation in South Korea. These organizations have had many tax benefits have been given compared to other non－profit corporation. In this paper, we analyze the statements of subsidiaries 602 scholarships to assess whether there is a scholarship program being implemented properly as tax incentives for scholarship. As a result, direct expenditure such as scholarship expenditure is very lower than U.S and Japan do. It is evaluated by management quite inefficient.The problem is our political regulations focus on ‘fundamental property’. Related laws allow scholarship foundations to use ‘general property’ for their business, but the disposal of the ‘fundamental property’ shall be approved. these limitations restrict to activate the scholarship business.In order to overcome these problems mentioned and increase the scholarship program expenditure, it may be presented to the following improvements.First, it should be allowed to freely dispose of the former ‘fundamental property’. Scholarship Foundation as public organization does not require special tangible facilities, regarding of the nature of the scholarship, there is no particular reason to be strictly regulated the disposal of assets appearances. It is necessary that distinguish between ‘fundamental property’ and ‘general property’ for activating scholarship foundations. Legislated minimum standards of the properties are required or there is a need to alleviate the requirement for changes to the applications fundamental property and general property.In addition to improvement of ‘fundamental property’, ‘general property’ which is generated by ‘fundamental property’ should be more encouraged. Because the direct source of scholarship is from ‘general property’, like ‘fundamental property’, it also requires lower bound for ‘general property’. If lower bound requirement is hard to match establishment, there are two examples of alternatives. First, we can impose penalty if organizations do not to meet lower bound requirements. Second, as ratio of normal property is higher, the more tax benefits are granted.Third, in order to increase the expenditure related to scholarships, penalty is required unless organization spent scholarship lower than net investment. such as additional taxes on reserved earnings. Another way is the inclusion in gross revenue if total expenses are lower than scholarships.Previous studies have mainly discussed installation of the Institute for Public Interest verification, equity relief appearances limits such as the establishment of procedures. Our study suggests ensuring the autonomy of property disposal of the scholarship foundation as a way to improve scholarship foundation."

This g-ray irradiation induces a permanent damage that has increased ideality factor and series resistance for all samples. It was accompanied by a decrease in Schottky barrier height with nitrogen content up to 0.4%N and remained constant thereafter. Radiation was also found to degrade the reverse leakage current.At high frequency (1 MHz), capacitance and conductance decreased after radiation due to a decrease in net doping concentration. Interface state density and series resistance were determined from C-V-f and G/u-V-f characteristics using Hill-Coleman methods. Interface states density exponentially decreased with increasing frequency confirming the behavior of interface traps response to ac signal.Series resistance increases after irradiation is attributed to carrier's removal effect andmobility degradation. It has two peaks in the accumulation and inversion region for some diodes (0.4%N, 0.8%N). g-ray irradiation produced traps levels and recombination centers that reduce relaxation time. An increase in %N content can impede irradiation damagewith even some compensationwhen the percent of diluted nitrogen is high (1.2%N)."

Local time was defined as ‘a unique local rhythm or time.’ This time is made in the process of local members’ daily life, which constitutes the implicit local property, that is, energy. Local time exists in various ways and shows aspects such as crashes, subsumption and reconstitution with national time or capital time operating outside the local area.  This study analyzed Changpyung Diary written by Nae-u Choi who lived in Chang-in-ri, Imsil-gun, Jeollabuk-do Province in order to explore local time. This diary records the process of the modernization of agricultural communities in the 1970s and 1980s in detail. Since the village people worked in agriculture, they had a time dependent to nature. However, the state would dominate them by taking over the peasants’ time. There are increasing cases of the collision of local time, the rhythm of the peasants’ life to national time, characterized by the performance principle. Village people were persuaded by national time, while they constituted their own time by which they could move around national time. The national time during this period made the rhythms of village people’s life faster on the one hand and made it economically more difficult on the other hand.

Within the limited government budgets, however, those challenges have constantly led governments to more and more rely upon private sectors in terms of their expertises and experiences as well as participatory democracy so that a streamlined and effective government functionality may be realized and structurally stabilized to the satisfaction of voting citizens and taxpayers. Thus, since the late 1970s, every country's legal environment scrambled to embrace the system of delegation of government tasks to a private sector with each developing its own version of law and administration, and so did the Republic of Korea legislating delegative norms under the Government Organization Act and its implementing regulations, which, however, due to their restrictive approach, are said to insufficiently reflect the reality of critical functions with regard to the mandatory vessel inspections and the Recognized Organization(RO)'s legal relation with a government. In the meanwhile, the delegation of governmental authority to a private sector in the United States is often evaluated to have gone through a lot of practical and normative experiments and accumulative administrative experiences, making it all worthwhile to benchmark their approach. Therefore, in this paper, peeping into the delegation system of the United States would benefit us to understand how to define or clarify the nature of vessel inspection activities and the legal position of the ROs under the laws of delegation in light of their conventional and transhistorical contributory values to safety at sea"

This paper presents a 2D model to calculate axial vibration natural frequency of power transformer winding based on the elastic dynamics theory, and according to the elastic support equivalent principle of radial pressboards. The 3D model to calculate natural vibration frequency can be simplified as a 2D one as the support of pressboards on the winding is same. It is verified that results of the 2D model are consistent with those of 3D one, but the former can achieve much higher calculation efficiency. It shows that increasing the width and number of pressboards can improve axial natural frequency through formula analysis and simulation, and also the relations between the changes of axial pre-compression and axial natural vibration frequency on the windings are investigated.

Through simulation and experimental study on the EEUHP transformer, the influence of five key parameters on the output flow of the EEUHP transformer were obtained, and some conclusions can be drawn.Firstly, the mathematical model was proved to be valid. Furthermore, the EEUHP transformer costs fewer of compressed air than the normal HP transformer when the output flow of the two kinds of transformers are almost same. Moreover, with an increase in the output pressure, the output flow decreases sharply. Finally, with an increase in the effective area of hydraulic output port, the output flow increases distinctly.

In this paper we propose anew algorithm that leads to considerable reduction of the computation in the TP model transformation. The mainidea behind the modified algorithm is to minimize the number of discretized points to acquire as much informationas possible. The modified TP model transformation can readily be executed on a regular computer efficiently andconcisely, especially in higher dimensional cases when the original TP model transformation fails.

estimating the diffuse solar radiation using a coupled support vector machine–wavelet transform model,2016,"['Diffuse solar radiation', 'Support vector machine', 'Wavelet transform algorithm', 'Combined model', 'Estimation']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Diffuse solar radiation is a fundamental parameter highly required in several solar energy applications. Despite its significance, diffuse solar radiation is not measured in many locations around the world due to technical and fiscal limitations. On this account, determining the amount of diffuse radiation alternatively based upon precise and reliable estimating methods is indeed essential. In this paper, a coupled model is developed for estimating daily horizontal diffuse solar radiation by integrating the support vector machine (SVM) with wavelet transform (WT) algorithm. To test the validity of the coupled SVM–WT method, daily measured global and diffuse solar radiation data sets for city of Kerman situated in a sunny part of Iran are utilized. For the developed SVM–WT model, diffuse fraction (cloudiness index) is correlated with clearness index as the only input parameter. The suitability of SVM–WT is evaluated against radial basis function SVM (SVM–RBF), artificial neural network (ANN) and a 3rd degree empirical model established for this study. It is found that the estimated diffuse solar radiation values by the SVM–WT model are in favourable agreements with measured data. According to the conducted statistical analysis, the obtained mean absolute bias error, root mean square error and correlation coefficient are 0.5757MJ/m<SUP>2</SUP>, 0.6940MJ/m<SUP>2</SUP> and 0.9631, respectively. While for the SVM–RBF ranked next the attained values are 1.0877MJ/m<SUP>2</SUP>, 1.2583MJ/m<SUP>2</SUP> and 0.8599, respectively.

Several facial recognition algorithms were developed and discussed in the literature but very little work is focused on facial recognition based on illumination. The appearance of the face image is usually affected by illumination conditions that hinder the facial recognition process. Hence in this paper, we propose and develop a new facial recognition algorithm based on Adaptive Haar Wavelet Transform called Tetrolet Transfrom.

However, these methods often fail, especially where the slope of the terrain is very high; this results in large geometric difference in the stereo pair. To address this issue, we introduced an adaptive stereo matching scheme that incorporates image transformation for the slope in the epipolar image space. The matching patch is designed to adaptively transform the target image according to the terrain slope determined in the lower scale of the image pyramid. This transformation reduces the geometric difference between the stereoscopic images due to the image acquisition angle and the terrain slope. Experimental results with Kompsat-2 images showed that the proposed method increased the overall matching success rate by 5% and the vertical accuracy of the generated DEM improved by about 2 meters (17%).</P>"

The tyrosine kinase inhibitor nilotinib has inhibitory activity against c-kit and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor. We compared the effects of fluticasone and nilotinib on airway remodeling in a chronic asthma model. We also examined whether co-treatment with nilotinib and fluticasone had any synergistic effect in preventing airway remodeling. Methods: We developed a mouse model of airway remodeling, including smooth muscle thickening, in which ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized female BALB/c-mice were repeatedly exposed to intranasal OVA administration twice per week for 3 months. Mice were treated with fluticasone and/or nilotinib intranasally during the OVA challenge. Results: Mice chronically exposed to OVA developed eosinophilic airway inflammation and showed features of airway remodeling, including thickening of the peribronchial smooth muscle layer. Both f luticasone and nilotinib attenuated airway smooth muscle thickening. However, only nilotinib suppressed fibrotic changes, demonstrating inhibition of collagen deposition. Fluticasone reduced pro-inflammatory cells, such as eosinophils, and several cytokines, such as interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-5, and IL-13, induced by repeated OVA challenges. On the other hand, nilotinib reduced transforming growth factor β1 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and inhibited fibroblast proliferation significantly. Conclusions: These results suggest that fluticasone and nilotinib suppressed airway remodeling in this chronic asthma model through anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic pathways, respectively."

OSA causes chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) during sleep. Experimental evidence suggests that CIH may trigger liver injury, inflammation, and fibrogenesis. The purpose of this study was to examine whether CIH induces fibrotic changes in the liver in mice with diet-induced hepatic steatosis. Method: Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high fat or regular diet for 12 weeks and then exposed to CIH or room air for 4 weeks. We assessed the level of inflammation and fibrosis in the liver tissue by western blotting, real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and collagen assay. Results: In CIH with diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice, there were significant increase in α1(I)-collagen mRNA, compared to the room air groups; trends toward increases in platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFRß), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFß1), and caspase 3 by real time PCR. CIH mice showed hepatic fibrosis by Masson`s trichrome staining and hydroxyproline assay. CIH caused increases in protein expression of Interleukin 1 ß (IL-lß), toll like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88), phospho I kappa B (I-κB), phospho-ERK, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and the p65 subunit of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), in liver, which was augmented in DIO mice.

This trait causes slow instruction, assessment procedures, high resource consumption and poor detection rate. Due to their expensive computational requirements during both training and detection, IDSs are mostly ineffective for real-time anomaly detection. This paper proposes a dimensionality reduction technique that is able to enhance the performance of IDSs up to constant time O(1) based on the Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Furthermore, the present study offers a feature selection approach for identifying major components in real time. The PCA algorithm transforms high-dimensional feature vectors into a low-dimensional feature space, which is used to determine the optimum volume of factors. The proposed approach was assessed using HTTP packet payload of ISCX 2012 IDS and DARPA 1999 dataset. The experimental outcome demonstrated that our proposed anomaly detection achieved promising results with 97% detection rate with 1.2% false positive rate for ISCX 2012 dataset and 100% detection rate with 0.06% false positive rate for DARPA 1999 dataset. Our proposed anomaly detection also achieved comparable performance in terms of computational complexity when compared to three state-of-the-art anomaly detection systems."

Our objective in this paper is to represent an approach that allows controlling transformation from CIM level to PIM level in accordance with the MDA approach. More precisely, we propose a methodology for transforming service-oriented business models, to web-based design models. Despite the importance of service-oriented models and web-based models, the transformation between them is not addressed in MDA researches. Our methodology is based on creating a good CIM models service-oriented, through construction rules, to facilitate transformation towards PIM models web-based. Next, our transformation rules allow a semi-automatic transformation from CIM to PIM. Our approach conforms to MDA recommendations, because it allows considering the business dimension in the CIM level, and it allows modeling this latter level by using SoaML, the OMG standard for modeling services. However, we based on UML 2 to model PIM level, because UML is advocated by MDA in PIM level.

We argue that a friendly interactive visual user interface for OA Data Model based annotation tools, which is largely based on an effective user interface model, plays an essential role in the usability of the tools. In this paper we propose an Interactive Visual User Interface Model for Open Annotations (or simply IVUIM4OA), which allows the annotating user to dynamically transform OA data into a visual representation and to interactively manipulate the visual objects to modify the OA data or produce new one. IVUIM4OA is an adaptation of a generic information visualization model, the Data State Reference Model, for the specifics of the visualization of OA data; it is further extended with view operators that enable the user to interact with the visual objects.

For the generation of test cases, scenarios need to be found for representing as a sequence diagram, and to extract test paths satisfying the test coverage. However, it is hard to automatically extract test paths from the sequence diagram because a sequence diagram represents loop, opt, and alt information using CombinedFragments. To resolve this problem, we propose a transformation process that transforms a sequence diagram into an activity diagram which represents scenarios as a type of control flows. In addition, we generate test cases from the activity diagram by applying a test coverage concept. Finally, we present a case study for test cases generation from a sequence diagram."

However, the existing domain engineering methods do not elicit information necessary for the Component-based Software Development process, such as, selecting and configuring appropriate components. In this paper, we suggest a method that systematically defines, analyzes and designs a crop monitoring frameworks domain to enhance reusability effectively in Model Driven Engineering and Component-based Software Development. For this, we extract information objectively that can be reused in a crop monitoring domain from the requirement analysis phase. We sustain and refine crop monitoring information, and match them to artifacts of each phase in domain engineering. Through this method, reusable domain components and malleable domain architecture can be produced. In addition, we show the practical applicability and features of our approach via a new clouding and IOT technology."

However, there are two problems for this approach: 1) the JND value of each transform coefficient is estimated for a fixed-sized DCT kernel (e.g., 8 x 8), but flexible coding structures with variable-sized transform units have been utilized in standard video coding frameworks, such high efficiency video coding (HEVC) and 2) the DCT transform coefficients are suppressed by the amounts of JND values for the removal of perceptual redundancy, but the DCT transform coefficients of residues are not sufficiently suppressed due to many small transform coefficient values in mid-and high-frequency regions below the JND values. In order to solve these problems, we propose a more generalized visibility model in the DCT domain, called the DCT-based local distortion detection probability (LDDP) model that can estimate a degree of distortion visibility for any distribution of the transform coefficients of any sized DCT kernel for residues. Furthermore, we propose an HEVC-compliant LDDP-based PVC scheme where transform coefficients are sufficiently suppressed based on the LDDP model. The proposed PVC scheme is implemented in the HEVC Test Model (HM 11.0) reference software to show the effectiveness of the LDDP-based PVC scheme.

In terms of a large-scale brain network, in this paper, we focus on time-varying patterns of functional networks, i.e., functional dynamics, inherent in rs-fMRI, which is one of the emerging issues along with the network modelling. Specifically, we propose a novel methodological architecture that combines deep learning and state-space modelling, and apply it to rs-fMRI based Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) diagnosis. We first devise a Deep Auto-Encoder (DAE) to discover hierarchical non-linear functional relations among regions, by which we transform the regional features into an embedding space, whose bases are complex functional networks. Given the embedded functional features, we then use a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to estimate dynamic characteristics of functional networks inherent in rs-fMRI via internal states, which are unobservable but can be inferred from observations statistically. By building a generative model with an HMM, we estimate the likelihood of the input features of rs-fMRI as belonging to the corresponding status, i.e., MCI or normal healthy control, based on which we identify the clinical label of a testing subject. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we performed experiments on two different datasets and compared with state-of-the-art methods in the literature. We also analyzed the functional networks learned by DAE, estimated the functional connectivities by decoding hidden states in HMM, and investigated the estimated functional connectivities by means of a graph-theoretic approach."

setting-less transformer protection for ensuring security and dependability,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The 'setting-less' protection approach is an innovative protection scheme with increased dependability and security. This method is based on dynamic state estimation, which continuously extracts the operating condition of a protection zone from real-time measurements and the protection zone dynamic model. The dynamic state estimation computes the probability that the measurements fit the dynamic model of the protection zone within the measurement accuracy via the Chi-square test. The probability represents the goodness of fit of measurements to the dynamic model of the protection zone. We refer to it as the confidence level that the protection zone is healthy. High confidence levels imply that the protection zone operates normally, while low confidence levels indicate that internal abnormalities/faults may have occurred. Note that the proposed method does not require coordination with other protection schemes which sometimes compromise security and/or dependability. In this paper, the setting-less protection approach is described and applied to transformer protection. The feasibility of the setting-less transformer protection is verified with numerical experiments of several case studies (e.g., transformer energization, external faults, internal faults, and high impedance faults). The method has been verified in the laboratory and there are plans for field testing.</P>"

Porosity is one of the key parameters for accumulation of hydrocarbon but its prediction is difficult due to significant variation over a reservoir volume.A spatial distribution of porosity can be investigated by integrating the 3-D seismic and well log attributes which may help in determining such reservoir variation. In addition, nonlinear multivariable regression techniques such as multivariable transform, Genetic algorithm, and Probabilistic Neural Network analysis have also been implemented to achieve high correlation coefficients between well log properties and seismic data. Results from nonlinear regression have better correlations than linear regression. In this study, a 3-D low frequency model (LFM) is proposed which can be estimated by kriging interpolation of resultant impedance values from well log data. Furthermore, “seismic inversion” is adopted for extracting correlated attributes to merge with the LFM so as to better construct a pseudo log volume.A polynomial neural network (PNN*1) is utilized to convert resultant acoustic impedance values into a distinct reservoir property such as porosity. PNN* is trained, tested and validated by using gammaray and resultant acoustic impedance values as input and effective porosity values as a target. The trained PNN* is then applied over the whole reservoir volume to generate a pseudo log volume. In the proposed low frequency model, an attempt has been made to achieve high correlation between the predicted and measured porosity logs.It will improve the reservoir characterization and lead to better estimation of hydrocarbon reserves. This low frequency model achieves better correlation between the predicted and true porosity log even with a minimum number of measured well logs."

This paper takes the large-scale cave as equipotential body, treats matrix and fracture as double porous media, and establishes the flow model. Laplace transform is used to simplify the model, and then the model is solved using boundary element method. Considering the wellbore storage effect and skin effect, the bottomhole pressure-transient curve is obtained using Stefest numerical inversion method. Comparing the results of analytical solution and boundary element method in the dual porosity medium illustrate the accuracy of this model. The sensitivity of cave parameters is analyzed. It shows that the larger the cave radius is, the stronger the convex and concave of curve is. The convex is earlier and concave is sooner when cave is closer to the well. The segment of convex keeps longer and the concave margin is greater with the larger compressibility ratio. Finally, as an application example, actual test data from a large-scale cave reservoir is analyzed using this model, and the location and size of cave are obtained. It has a certain significance for the reserve evaluation and well test in this reservoir."

For the in vivo study, electrical stimulation of the cavernosal nerve was performed and erectile function was measured in all groups. Immunohistochemical antibody staining was performed for transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and hypoxia inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α). In vivo measurement of erectile function in the Pathologic group showed significantly lower values than those in the Control group, whereas the Treatment group showed significantly improved values in comparison with those in the Pathologic group. The results of western blot analysis revealed that systemically administered omega-3 fatty acids ameliorated the cavernosal molecular environment. Our study suggests that omega-3 fatty acids improve intracavernosal pressure and have a beneficial role against pathophysiological consequences such as fibrosis or hypoxic damage on a CPI rat model, which represents a structural erectile dysfunction model."

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of long-term DEP exposure on AHR, inflammation, lung fibrosis, and goblet cell hyperplasia in a mouse model. Methods: BALB/c mice were exposed to DEPs 1 hour a day for 5 days a week for 3 months in a closed-system chamber attached to a ultrasonic nebulizer (low dose: 100 μg/m3 DEPs, high dose: 3 mg/m3 DEPs). The control group was exposed to saline. Enhanced pause was measured as an indicator of AHR. Animals were subjected to whole-body plethysmography and then sacrificed to determine the performance of bronchoalveolar lavage and histology. Results: AHR was higher in the DEP group than in the control group, and higher in the high-dose DEP than in the low-dose DEP groups at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The numbers of neutrophils and lymphocytes were higher in the high-dose DEP group than in the low-dose DEP group and control group at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The levels of interleukin (IL)-5, IL-13, and interferon-γ were higher in the low-dose DEP group than in the control group at 12 weeks. The level of IL-10 was higher in the high-dose DEP group than in the control group at 12 weeks. The level of vascular endothelial growth factor was higher in the low-dose and high-dose DEP groups than in the control group at 12 weeks. The level of IL-6 was higher in the low-dose DEP group than in the control group at 12 weeks. The level of transforming growth factor-β was higher in the high-dose DEP group than in the control group at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The collagen content and lung fibrosis in lung tissue was higher in the high-dose DEP group at 8 and 12 weeks. Conclusions: These results suggest that long-term DEP exposure may increase AHR, inflammation, lung fibrosis, and goblet cell hyperplasia in a mouse model."
ethyl acetate fraction of <i> amomum xanthioides</i> exerts antihepatofibrotic actions via the regulation of fibrogenic cytokines in a dimethylnitrosamine-induced rat model,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><I>Amomum xanthioides</I> has been traditionally used to treat diverse digestive system disorders in the Asian countries. We investigated antihepatofibrotic effects of ethyl acetate fraction of<I> Amomum xanthioides</I> (EFAX). Liver fibrosis is induced by dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) injection (intraperitoneally, 10 mg/kg of DMN for 4 weeks to Sprague-Dawley rats). EFAX (25 or 50 mg/kg), silymarin (50 mg/kg), or distilled water was orally administered every day. The DMN injection drastically altered body and organ mass, serum biochemistry, and platelet count, while EFAX treatment significantly attenuated this alteration. Severe liver fibrosis is determined by trichrome staining and measurement of hydroxyproline contents. EFAX treatment significantly attenuated these symptoms as well as the increase in oxidative by-products of lipid and protein metabolism in liver tissues. DMN induced a dramatic activation of hepatic stellate cells and increases in the levels of protein and gene expression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-<I>β</I>), platelet derived growth factor-beta (PDGF-<I>β</I>), and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). Immunohistochemical analyses revealed increases in the levels of protein and gene expression of <I>α</I>-smooth muscle actin. These alterations were significantly normalized by EFAX treatment. Our findings demonstrate the potent antihepatofibrotic properties of EFAX via modulation of fibrogenic cytokines, especially TGF-<I>β</I> in the liver fibrosis rat model. </P>"

The three phase load currents are transformed into synchronous rotating reference frame in order to reduce the order of the control system. The proposed current controller calculates reference current command for harmonic current components in synchronous frame. The fundamental load current components are transformed into dc components revealing only the harmonics. The predictive current controller will add robustness and fast compensation to generate commands to the SVPWM which minimizes switching frequency while maintaining fast harmonic compensation. By using the model predictive control, the optimal switching state to be applied to the next sampling time is selected. The filter current contains only the harmonic components, which are the reference compensating currents. In this method the supply current will be equal to the fundamental component of load current and a part of the current at fundamental frequency for losses of the inverter. Mathematical analysis and the feasibility of the suggested approach are verified through simulation results under steady state and transient conditions for non-linear load. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is confirmed through experimental validation."

The dilatations were attributed to changes in the phase composition and phase density due to austenitic decomposition and carbon partitioning. To develop a prediction model for the dilatation during the Q&P process, conventional kinetics models for non-diffusional and diffusional phase transformations were improved by introducing the evolution of the transformation rate parameters during the austenitic decomposition. Furthermore, a kinetics equation for carbon partitioning was also proposed after considering the effect of constituent martensite on the partitioning rate. Finally, variations of the phase densities in the partitioned phases were modeled to describe the effect of carbon partitioning on the dilatation. The proposed models were implemented in a finite element code, and simulated dilatometry tests could accurately capture the experimentally measured dilation behaviors under the Q&P process with single and 2-stage partitioning conditions.

coupled model for simulation of landslides and debris flows at local scale,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>This research connects different but sequential processes of slope failure: landslide occurrence, debris-flow initiation from landslides, and debris-flow propagation to lowlands. The coupled model presented in this study consists of a deterministic landslide susceptibility model that estimates the landslide source and local geomorphological mobilization criteria for selecting debris-flow initiation points, and an empirical debris-flow model that simulates the transport and propagation of failed materials from the identified source areas. The debris flow initiation in the spreading analysis was estimated from the landslide source by landslide analysis. Then, its inspection using the mobilization criteria was used to determine if the landslide transformed into a debris flow. While the geomorphological criteria were calibrated using data obtained from Gyeong-gi Province, the validation of the coupled approach was done at Mt. Woomyeon. In comparison with a landslide inventory map, the model simulations resulted in reasonable estimates of all the mountain hazards caused by slope failures as a sequential process on a local scale. The coupled analysis proposed in this study affirms that it is important to manage them together because of the correlation between landslides and debris flows. Thus, if it is parameterized and calibrated for local conditions the suggested model, linking landslides and debris flows with the mobilization analysis, provides a powerful tool for decision makers in territorial planning and disaster preparedness.</P>"

The incidence formulas among node voltages, loop currents and node current injections have been developed based on node-branch incidence matrix of the distribution network. The method can solve the power flow directly and has higher efficiency. Moreover, the paper provides a modified method to model DT branches by considering winding connections, phase shifting and off-nominal tap ratio, and then DT branches could be seen like one transmission line with the proposed power flow method. To deal with the PV nodes, an improved approach to calculate reactive power increment at each PV node was deduced based on the assumption that the positive-sequence voltage magnitude of PV node is fixed at a given value. Then during calculating the power flow at each iteration, it only needs to update current injection at each PV node with the proposed algorithm. The process is very simple and clear. The results of IEEE 4 nodes and the modified IEEE 34 nodes test feeders verified the correctness and efficiency of the proposed hybrid power flow algorithm."

Electrical utilities frequently face the problem of flashover of insulators due to pollution deposition on their surface. Several research works based on leakage current (LC) measurement has been already carried out in developing diagnostic techniques for these insulators. Since the LC signal is highly intermittent in nature, estimation of pollution severity based on LC signal measurement over a short period of time will not produce accurate results. Reports on the measurement and analysis of LC signals over a long period of time is scanty. This paper attempts to use Random Forest (RF) classifier, which produces accurate results on large data bases, to analyze the pollution severity of high voltage tower insulators. Leakage current characteristics over a long period of time were measured in the laboratory on porcelain insulator. Pollution experiments were conducted at 11 kV AC voltage. Time domain analysis and wavelet transform technique were used to extract both basic features and histogram features of the LC signal. RF model was trained and tested with a variety of LC signals measured over a lengthy period of time and it is noticed that the proposed RF model based pollution severity classifier is efficient and will be helpful to electrical utilities for real time implementation."

Among the plasma sensors, optical emission spectroscopy (OES) has been widely utilized and its high dimensionality has required multivariate analysis (MVA) techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA). PCA, however, might devaluate physical meaning of target process during its statistical calculation. In addition, inherent noise from charge coupled devices (CCD) array in OES might deteriorate PCA model performance. Therefore, it is desirable to pre-select physically important variables and to filter out noisy signals before modeling OES based plasma data. For these purposes, this paper introduces a peak wavelength selection algorithm for selecting physically meaningful wavelength in plasma and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for filtering out noisy signals from a CCD array. The effectiveness of the PCA model introduced in this paper is verified by comparing fault detection capabilities of conventional PCA model under the various source power or pressure faulty situations in a capacitively coupled plasma etcher. Even though the conventional PCA model fails to detect all of the faulty situations under the tests, the PCA model introduced in this paper successively detect even extremely small variation such as 0.67% of source power fault. The results introduced in this paper is expected to contribute to OES based plasma monitoring capability in plasma etching for more than Moore's law era."

A mouse model was generated by repeated intranasal challenge with ovalbumin and Aspergillus fungal protease twice a week for 8 weeks. SAMe was orally administered every 24 h for 8 weeks. We performed bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid analysis and histopathological examination. The levels of various cytokines and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) were measured in the lung tissue. Cultured macrophages and fibroblasts were employed to evaluate the underlying anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic mechanisms of SAMe. The magnitude of airway inflammation and fibrosis, as well as the total BAL cell counts, were significantly suppressed in the SAMe-treated groups. A reduction in T helper type 2 pro-inflammatory cytokines and HNE levels was observed in mouse lung tissue after SAMe administration. Macrophages cultured with SAMe also showed reduced cellular oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Moreover, SAMe treatment attenuated transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-induced fibronectin expression in cultured fibroblasts. SAMe had a suppressive effect on airway inflammation and fibrosis in a mouse model of chronic asthma, at least partially through the attenuation of oxidative stress and TGF-β-induced fibronectin expression. The results of this study suggest a potential role for SAMe as a novel therapeutic agent in chronic asthma."

pv cell model by single-diode electrical equivalent circuit,2016,"['EN50530', 'PV power generation', 'PV simulator', 'Si-Cr', 'Thin-film', 'PV cell modeling']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper models PV cells as a single-diode electrical equivalent circuit. It extracts the parameters of the equivalent circuit through Thevenin-Norton transformation at three remarkable operation points such as open circuit condition, short circuit condition, and maximum power operating condition where the voltage and current are commonly provided by manufacturers. Since the slopes of the PV cell characteristic I-V curve at those operating points are associated with series resistance and shunt resistance of the electrical equivalent circuit, equivalent resistance at maximum power operation point, gradients of these three slops can be used as the boundary conditions to solve the unknown values of PV cell equivalent circuit. With this regards, this paper provides complete set of simultaneous equations to solve any type of PV cell models as single-diode equivalent circuit named by K-algorithm. Proposed method is advantageous as it not only describes the I-V curve of initial PV cell products that manufacturers ensure by the characteristic datasheets, but also properly describes the deformed I-V characteristic curve of practically aged PV cells by just measuring the voltage and current values of at three remarkable operating points."
aragonite crystallization in a christmas-tree model microfluidic device with the addition of magnesium ions,2016,"['Christmas-tree model microfluidic device', 'aragonite', 'calcium carbonate']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Aragonite is an important dimorph of calcium carbonate, industrially and biologically. However, aragonite is so thermodynamically unstable that it is difficult to understand its formation mechanism. A continuous microfluidic system was employed, in which crystallization was induced only by diffusion in a micron-scale channel. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) formed by liquid-liquid reaction and magnesium ions (Mg2+) were used as additives. To assess the influence of Mg2+ concentration, the Mg2+/Ca2+ molar ratio was set to 1, 3, and 5. Laminar streams flowed in the detection channel with different concentration gradients.The initial crystallization time (tI.C) increased exponentially and the density of crystals decreased as the Mg2+ ion concentration increased. Following transformation of all particles into snowman or sphere shapes, they became spinose sphere-shaped crystals, which was the final form in this study."

elsholtzia ciliata (thunb.) hylander attenuates renal inflammation and interstitial fibrosis via regulation of tgf-sz and smad3 expression on unilateral ureteral obstruction rat model,2016,"['Elsholtzia ciliata (Thunb.) Hylander', 'Transforming growth factor-β', 'Interstitial fibrosis', 'Chronic kidney diseases', 'Unilateral ureteral obstruction']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Background: Renal interstitial fibrosis is characterized by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix, which leads to end-stage renal failure. Purpose: The aim of this study was to explore the effect of Elsholtzia ciliata (Thunb.) Hylander ethanol extract (ECE) on renal interstitial fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Study design: After quantitative analysis of ECE using the high performance liquid chromatographyphotodiode array (HPLC-PDA) method, an in vitro study was performed to assess the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects of ECE, using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and transforming growth factor-beta(TGF-beta), respectively. Methods: For in vivo study, all male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (n = 10/group), except for those in the control group, underwent UUO. The rats were orally treated with water (control), captopril (positive control, 200 mg/kg), and ECE (300 and 500 mg/kg) for 14 days. Results: In ECE, luteolin and rosmarinic acid were relatively abundant among the other flavonoids and phenolic acids. ECE treatment ameliorated LPS-induced overexpression of nuclear factor-kappa B, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-6 and improved oxidative stress in RAW 264.7 cells. Furthermore, ECE treatment suppressed TGF-beta-induced a-smooth muscle actin and matrix metalloproteinase 9 expression in human renal mesangial cells. In the UUO model, 14 consecutive days of ECE treatment improved UUO-induced renal damage and attenuated histopathological alterations and interstitial fibrosis. Moreover, the renal expression of TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, and Smad 3 were inhibited by ECE treatment. Conclusion: Taken together, the effects of ECE may be mediated by blocking the activation of TGF-beta and inflammatory cytokines, leading subsequently to degradation of the ECM accumulation pathway. Based on these findings, ECE might serve as an improved treatment strategy for renal fibrotic disease. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.</P>"

It applies the theory of Janos Kornai on socialist systems, in particular the main line of causation, as well as elements of rational choice theory. The CRE model provides a tool for systematically processing information on North Korea that is typically incomplete. The effects of 23 actions that have taken place since 2012 in the fields of ideology, property rights, coordination, military affairs and external influence are discussed. The combined outcome is mixed and corresponds with reality, where neither a retreat to pre-1990 socialism nor a full-fledged reform could be observed. However, new insights are found on single effects and their interplay. This provides a practical tool for scholars who aim for a systematic understanding of the past, and for politicians who need to conduct an advance impact analysis of future policies."

In the field of remote sensing image application, change detection is of the same area is analyzed by two different periods of remote sensing images, testing to determine the region in a period of change information. To enhance the traditional change detection algorithms we modify the method as the follows. Firstly, we analyze the mathematical forms of the game theory as the co-evolution has the basic characteristics of game theory and the dynamic characteristics of co-evolution through continuous evolution and eventually reaches a stable equilibrium state because of the feature. Later, we discuss the novel mathematical optimization approaches for the change detection based on the proposed game theory prior. Then, we combine independent component analysis and the bounded rationality conditions to finalize the detection algorithm. The independent component analysis is a data processing method appeared in recent years which can be as an extension of PCA and it will be the data transform into each other on the direction of the independence with higher robustness. In the experiment part, we simulate the experiment with the other state-of-the-art algorithms. The result reflects that our algorithm outperforms under various conditions and enhances the detection accuracy from 95.8% to 97.9% which has made the new breakthrough."
multi-server queueing system with a generalized phase-type service time distribution as a model of call center with a call-back option,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>A multi-server queueing system with a Markovian arrival process and finite and infinite buffers to model a call center with a call-back option is investigated. If all servers are busy during the customer arrival epoch, the customer may leave the system forever or move to the buffer (such a customer is referred to as a real customer), or, alternatively, request for call-back (such a customer is referred to as a virtual customer). During a waiting period, a real customer can be impatient and may leave the system without service or request for call-back (becomes a virtual customer). The service time of a customer and the dial time to a virtual customer for a server have a phase-type distribution. To simplify the investigation of the system we introduce the notion of a generalized phase-type service time distribution. We determine the stationary distribution of the system states and derive the Laplace-Stieltjes transforms of the sojourn and waiting time distributions for real and virtual customers. Some key performance measures are calculated and numerical results are presented.</P>"

Male Sprague Dawley rats were intraperitoneally injected with 10 mg/kg of DMN for 4 weeks (three consecutive days weekly). Rats were orally given distilled water, CGXII (50 or 100 mg/kg), or dimethyl dimethoxy biphenyl dicarboxylate (50 mg/kg) daily. DMN injection caused substantial alteration of total body weight and liver and spleen mass, whereas they were notably normalized by CGXII. CGXII treatment also markedly attenuated the elevation of serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels, hepatic lipid peroxidation, and protein carbonyl contents. Collagen accumulation in hepatic tissue evidenced by histopathological analysis and quantitative assessment of hepatic hydroxyproline was ameliorated by CGXII. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed decreased <I>α</I>-smooth muscle actin supporting the antihepatofibrotic effect of CGXII. The profibrogenic cytokines transforming growth factor-<I>β</I>, platelet-derived growth factor-<I>β</I>, and connective tissue growth factor were increased by DMN injection.

Depilated areas were completely covered with fully-grown hair in all study groups (control group, L. japonica extract group, and L. japonica extract mixed with growth factor group) and the hair re-growth score was the highest in the group treated with L. japonica supplemented with insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1).The width and length of the hair follicles showed a significant increase in the groups treated with L. japonica mixed with IGF-1, compared to the control groups. Groups treated with L. japonica mixed with growth factor showed significantly increased gene expression of IGF-1 and decreased expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, compared to the control groups. We confirmed that IGF-1 was more effective in promoting hair growth than vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

To explain a.l.i.c., we established one theory naming wrongfulness model. In wrongfulness model, the crime is defined as not only a conduct but also a causal process. The wrongfulness of crime is the assessment of the social harm. The causal wrongfulness is the assessment of the social harm of criminal process. And the culpability is defined as blameworthiness for the conduct or causal wrongfulness by intent or negligence. Now, we can explain a.l.i.c as the case that the crime has both causal wrongfulness and the blameworthy culpability for it although its perpetration is irresponsible. We can apply this wrongfulness model to explain the seven case patterns of a.l.i.c.. First pattern of a.l.i.c. is intent result crime. The causal wrongfulness of intent result crime is the causal process to result displayed intentionally. The second pattern is a.l.i.c. of conduct crime. The causal wrongfulness of conduct crime is causation relationship from earlier act to later act controlled by intent. The other patterns are the crimes of earlier negligence act and later negligence act, of earlier negligence act and later intent act, of earlier act and later involuntary act, of diminished capacity, of perpetration in insane state en route. We can affirm that our wrongfulness model can explain all seven patterns of case law in German and Japan. But traditional ``the elements of the crime model`` can explain only one pattern, the intent result crime. So we can say that theoretical superiority of our model proves. This means that the German theoretical system of crime must be reconsidered because the premises of our model imply the transformation of the established German theory of crime."

After the noise are removed with filter using frequency feature, the signals are reconstructed with dimensional transformation to overcome limit which have just one-dimension feature with voltage value for using convolution operation. Then, the reconstructed signal data is finally classified and recognized using multiple learning layers model based on deep learning. Since the statistical model based on probability is sensitive to initial parameters, the result can change after training in modeling phase. Deep learning model can overcome this problem because of several layers in training phase.

In the light of all phase digital filtering theory, this paper proposes a novel transform based on discrete sine transform (DST), which is called all phase discrete sine biorthogonal transform (APDSBT). Applying APDSBT to JPEG scheme, the blocking artifacts are reduced significantly. The reconstructed image of APDSBT-JPEG is better than that of DCT-JPEG in terms of objective quality and subjective effect. For improving the efficiency of JPEG coding, the structure of JPEG is analyzed. We analyze key factors in design and evaluation of JPEG compression on the massive parallel graphics processing units (GPUs) using the compute unified device architecture (CUDA) programming model. Experimental results show that the maximum speedup ratio of parallel algorithm of APDSBT-JPEG can reach more than 100 times with a very low version GPU. Some new parallel strategies are illustrated in this paper for improving the performance of parallel algorithm. With the optimal strategy, the efficiency can be improved over 10%."

Adrenergic receptor antagonists have been evaluated as antifibrotic drugs in rodent models of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced cirrhosis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of carvedilol and doxazosin on fibrosis/cirrhosis in a hamster animal model. Methods: Cirrhotic-induced hamsters were treated by daily administration of carvedilol and doxazosin for 6 weeks. Hepatic function and histological evaluation were conducted by measuring biochemical markers, including total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and albumin, and liver tissue slices. Additionally, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) immunohistochemistry was analyzed. Results: Biochemical markers revealed that hepatic function was restored after treatment with doxazosin and carvedilol. Histological evaluation showed a decrease in collagen type I deposits and TGF-β-secreting cells. Conclusions: Taken together, these results suggest that the decrease in collagen type I following treatment with doxazosin or carvedilol is achieved by decreasing the profibrotic activities of TGF-β via the blockage of α1- and β-adrenergic receptor. Consequently, a diminution of fibrotic tissue in the CCl4-induced model of cirrhosis is achieved. (Gut Liver 2016;10:101-108)"

However, this is sometimes not the case in reality, there are cases where the data do not belong to one group. As against, the fuzzy clustering takes into consideration the degree of fuzzy membership of each pixel relative to different classes. In order to overcome some shortcoming with traditional clustering methods, such as slow convergence and their sensitivity to initialization values, we have used the Harmony Search algorithm. It is based on the population metaheuristic algorithm, imitating the musical improvisation process. The major thrust of this algorithm lies in its ability to integrate the key components of population-based methods and local search-based methods in a simple optimization model. We propose in this paper a new unsupervised clustering method called the Fuzzy Harmony Search-Fourier Transform (FHS-FT). It is based on hybridization fuzzy clustering and the harmony search algorithm to increase its exploitation process and to further improve the generated solution, while the Fourier transform to increase the size of the image`s data. The results show that the proposed method is able to provide viable solutions as compared to previous work."

Several studies have shown that stem cells provide a significant reduction in allergic airway inflammation and improve lung function in animal models. The immunomodulatory effects of stem cells in allergic airway disease may be mediated by the up-regulation of Tregs and increases in several soluble factors, such as prostaglandin E2, transforming growth factor-β, interleukin-10, and indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase. This review examines the current understanding of the immunomodulatory properties of stem cells and its therapeutic implication in allergic airway disease. Furthermore, we will discuss mechanisms by which stem cells inhibit allergic airway inflammation via immunomodulation from a Th2- to a Th1-biased response. (Allergy Asthma Respir Dis 2016;4:167-173)"

The starting point of this paper is that the success of German model of the 21st century would not be fully accounted without mentioning on the restructuring of the Euro capitalism.The following two tasks are performed in this paper. First, it explains the formative process of the Euro capitalism mediated by a phased intensification of European integration. After calling the attention to the relation of regime of accumulation at national level, Euro capitalism, and global political economy, this paper studies the major projects of European integration like single market, single currency, and the integration of financial market. Then it reconstructs how those projects can create successfully a common place of capitalism as its new space. Along with it, the characteristics of this Euro capitalism are mentioned. Secondly, it analyzes how German model has been changed in the process of European integration intensified and Euro capitalism constructed. Also it points out on Standortdebatte and privatization, Bündnis für Arbeit and Hartz reform, and the depression of wages under the Eurozone system in relation to the European integration. Germany can boost aggressive exports drive successfully owing to its competitiveness secured by so-called inner devaluation like wage depression and fiscal prudence, and in return the immense trade surplus of Germany proves its success. However, the equivalent attention should be paid to the fact that such a remarkable success of German model leads Euro capitalism into another way of a serious imbalance."

The recent trend that experience education has come to the fore as an area of liberal arts education among a variety of liberal arts education fields indicates that the outcomes of the operation of experience education in Mokwon university could set an example to other universities. Mokwon university is providing experience education in both major education and liberal arts education fields and the field of liberal arts education is especially being developed and operated with its focus on the subjects of personality and sensitivity.

Specific and feasible guidance for experience education must be made and budget, academic affairs, administration, and extracurricular programs should be implemented to support such guidance. In this regard, experience education is not just one academic subject but also contributes to improving the quality of college education. In addition, its desired goals can be attained only when universities undergo fundamental changes.In the future, there is a need not only to operate experience-based liberal arts curriculum by tackling various problems but also to make efforts so that such an attempt can be transformed into open education for local communities and citizens."

Methods: A classification model for viable seeds was developed using partial least square discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) with Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) and Raman spectroscopic data in the range of 9080-4150 cm(-1) (1400-2400 nm) and 1800-970 cm(-1), respectively. The datasets were divided into 70% to calibration and 30% to validation. To reduce noise from the spectra and compare the classification results, preprocessing methods, such as mean, maximum, and range normalization, multivariate scattering correction, standard normal variate, and 1st and 2nd derivatives with the Savitzky-Golay algorithm were used. Results: The classification accuracies for calibration using FT-NIR and Raman spectroscopy were both 99% with first derivative, whereas the validation accuracies were 90.5% with both multivariate scattering correction and standard normal variate, and 96.4% with the raw data (non-preprocessed data). Conclusions: These results indicate that FT-NIR and Raman spectroscopy are valuable tools for a feasible classification and evaluation of viable pepper seeds by providing useful information based on PLS-DA and the threshold value."

NoSQL databases have wide-ranging physical level data models like key-value, document, column oriented, graph etc. Designing such databases are complex due to absence of well-accepted common meta-modeling concepts for varied physical level data model. Thus, research challenges are exist towards achieving common interpretation of data and their semantics at conceptual level over disparate databases. In this paper, an ontology driven meta-model, called Ontology Driven NoSQL Data Model (ODNSDM), is proposed to conceptualize data representation facets over heterogeneous kinds of databases. The novelty of the proposed approach is to provide common conceptual level abstraction based on semantically enriched formal vocabularies for both NoSQL and SQL databases. The formal vocabularies are further implemented using an ontology editorial tool Protégé based on OWL (Web Ontology Language). Several crucial properties of the proposed model are also prescribed in this paper. In addition, the proposed framework is illustrated using case studies in order to show its practical exhibition.

bankruptcy prediction modeling using qualitative information based on big data analytics,2016,"['Bankruptcy Prediction', 'Big Data Analytics', 'Text Mining', 'Sentiment Analysis', 'Artificial Neural Networks', '부도예측', '빅데이터 분석', '텍스트 마이닝', '감성 분석', '인공신경망']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Many researchers have focused on developing bankruptcy prediction models using modeling techniques, such as statistical methods including multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) and logit analysis or artificial intelligence techniques containing artificial neural networks (ANN), decision trees, and support vector machines (SVM), to secure enhanced performance. Most of the bankruptcy prediction models in academic studies have used financial ratios as main input variables. The bankruptcy of firms is associated with firm’s financial states and the external economic situation. However, the inclusion of qualitative information, such as the economic atmosphere, has not been actively discussed despite the fact that exploiting only financial ratios has some drawbacks. Accounting information, such as financial ratios, is based on past data, and it is usually determined one year before bankruptcy. Thus, a time lag exists between the point of closing financial statements and the point of credit evaluation. In addition, financial ratios do not contain environmental factors, such as external economic situations. Therefore, using only financial ratios may be insufficient in constructing a bankruptcy prediction model, because they essentially reflect past corporate internal accounting information while neglecting recent information.  Thus, qualitative information must be added to the conventional bankruptcy prediction model to supplement accounting information. Due to the lack of an analytic mechanism for obtaining and processing qualitative information from various information sources, previous studies have only used qualitative information. However, recently, big data analytics, such as text mining techniques, have been drawing much attention in academia and industry, with an increasing amount of unstructured text data available on the web. A few previous studies have sought to adopt big data analytics in business prediction modeling. Nevertheless, the use of qualitative information on the web for business prediction modeling is still deemed to be in the primary stage, restricted to limited applications, such as stock prediction and movie revenue prediction applications. Thus, it is necessary to apply big data analytics techniques, such as text mining, to various business prediction problems, including credit risk evaluation. Analytic methods are required for processing qualitative information represented in unstructured text form due to the complexity of managing and processing unstructured text data.  This study proposes a bankruptcy prediction model for Korean small- and medium-sized construction firms using both quantitative information, such as financial ratios, and qualitative information acquired from economic news articles. The performance of the proposed method depends on how well information types are transformed from qualitative into quantitative information that is suitable for incorporating into the bankruptcy prediction model. We employ big data analytics techniques, especially text mining, as a mechanism for processing qualitative information. The sentiment index is provided at the industry level by extracting from a large amount of text data to quantify the external economic atmosphere represented in the media. The proposed method involves keyword-based sentiment analysis using a domain-specific sentiment lexicon to extract sentiment from economic news articles. The generated sentiment lexicon is designed to represent sentiment for the construction business by considering the relationship between the occurring term and the actual situation with respect to the economic condition of the industry rather than the inherent semantics of the term.  The experimental results proved that incorporating qualitative information based on big data analytics into the traditional bankruptcy prediction model based on accounting information is effective for enhancing the predictive performance.

As reported in an IEEE study, bearing failures include more than half of mechanical faults. To detect existence of this fault, methods such as (short-time) Fourier, (continuous-discrete) wavelet, and Park transforms introduced. Static modeling of fault behavior is determined to be the major deficiency of above-mentioned methods. In other words, using conventional detection techniques, fault is assumed to have deterministic behavior, in which the fault frequencies are constant. As a matter of fact, fault characteristics can be affected under loading or environmental conditions, which makes conventional standing invalid. Authors of this paper have developed their previously introduced technique, frequency-domain discrete wavelet transform (FD-DWT) into a stochastic model. This makes the detection process valid for more variety of fault conditions and leads to earlier detection of fault and less damage to motor compared to other strategies."

Immobilization is a form of decreased use in which skeletal muscle shows electrical activity, tension development, and motion. These results differ by muscle group. Spinal cord transection was selected to simulate spinal cord injury. Similar to the immobilization model, dramatic atrophy occurs in addition to fiber type conversion in this model. Despite the fact that electromyography shows unremarkable changes in muscle after hindlimb unloading, decreased muscle mass and contractile force are observed. Lastly, aging significantly decreases the numbers of muscle fibers and motor units. Skeletal muscle responses to decreased use include decreased strength, decreased fiber numbers, and fiber type transformation. These four models demonstrated different changes in the skeletal muscle. This review elucidates the different skeletal muscle adaptations in these four decreased use animal models and encourages further studies."

tool-wear monitoring during micro-end milling using wavelet packet transform and fisher's linear discriminant,2016,"['Condition monitoring', 'Hidden Markov model', 'Micro end mill', 'Single-period signal', 'Tool lifespan', 'Wavelet packet transform']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Tool wear is one of the most important parameters in micro-end milling, and can be used to monitor the condition of the machine and the tool. A micro-end mill has different characteristics from a macro-scale end mill; in particular, shank run-out (which is negligible in the macro-scale tool due to the low aspect ratio) is significant in micro-end milling, inducing excessive tool wear and reduced tool life and leading to sudden, premature failure. In this paper, a novel tool-wear monitoring method is described for determining the state of a micro-end mill using wavelet packet transforms and Fisher’s linear discriminant. Force and torque signals were measured using a dynamometer and were used to reflect geometric changes in the micro-end mill due to wear. Because of the small signal-to-noise ratio, sensor signals measured during the milling process were periodically averaged, and the resulting singleperiod signals provided improved efficiency of feature extraction using wavelet packet transforms. The extracted features were classified in the wavelet domain and used to determine the tool state employing a hidden Markov model. The recognition results were compared with those of an energy-based monitoring technique, and we found that our method could determine the tool state more accurately for both normal wear and premature failure of micro-end mills."

an improved image registration based on nonsubsampled contourlet transform and zernike moments,2016,"['Image registration', 'Feature extraction', 'Nonsubsampled contourlet transform', 'Zernike moments']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Feature-based registration is an effective and most widely used image registration method currently. It includes three critical steps, feature extraction, feature matching and transformation parameters estimation. This paper mainly explores the first two steps. In one of Chahira Serief’s paper about image registration, feature points extraction based on nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) was proposed and feature points matching based on Zernike moments was adopted. The registration accuracy and robustness of his algorithm are acceptable, but it can still be improved. In this paper, an improved scheme of this registration algorithm is proposed. The rotation invariance of NSCT-based feature points extraction is improved, which is beneficial to extract homologous feature points. And the reliability and effectiveness of Zernike moments-based feature points matching are improved, which can improve the matching accuracy. The improved registration algorithm can realize registration of images related by larger scaling, rotation and translation transformation. The simulation results show that the registration robustness is further improved, and the registration accuracy is still high."

By this way, the overall and local information can be used, which has advantage to color transform correction. To learn spatio-temporal transfer model, entry/exit zones of a non-overlapping topology can be effectively estimated by defining valid link and using clustering method. Then a kind of time constrain is set between two nodes to judge whether there is correlation of observations. Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method."

The expression for the inverse of the distribution function for the Lindley distribution does not exist in closed form. Hence, authors of many empirical studies on the Lindley distribution used methods for generating Lindley variates other than the inverse transform. We generated data from the Lindley distribution using the inverse transform approach by obtaining the Lindley variates numerically; we also generated data from this distribution using the composition approach. Following the generation of the Lindley variates using these two methods, we compare some statistical properties of the estimates of the Lindley model parameters based on the generated data. We conclude that the two methods produce similar results."

Kong’s filters perform best in the three kinds of filters over a practical range of offset distances in marine CSEM surveys. While the relative error versus distance appears as a V-shaped curve in semi-log scale, Mizunaga’s filters are the shortest in length and have a performance comparable to Kong’s filters. Anderson’s filters have a quite similar performance between the J0 and J1 filters, although these are somewhat inferior to Kong’s and Mizunaga’s filters when computing marine CSEM fields."
a class of non-linear exposure-response models suitable for health impact assessment applicable to large cohort studies of ambient air pollution,2016,"['Air pollution', 'Cohort', 'Exposure', 'Mortality', 'Particulate matter']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The effectiveness of regulatory actions designed to improve air quality is often assessed by predicting changes in public health resulting from their implementation. Risk of premature mortality from long-term exposure to ambient air pollution is the single most important contributor to such assessments and is estimated from observational studies generally assuming a log-linear, no-threshold association between ambient concentrations and death. There has been only limited assessment of this assumption in part because of a lack of methods to estimate the shape of the exposure-response function in very large study populations. In this paper, we propose a new class of variable coefficient risk functions capable of capturing a variety of potentially non-linear associations which are suitable for health impact assessment. We construct the class by defining transformations of concentration as the product of either a linear or log-linear function of concentration multiplied by a logistic weighting function. These risk functions can be estimated using hazard regression survival models with currently available computer software and can accommodate large population-based cohorts which are increasingly being used for this purpose. We illustrate our modeling approach with two large cohort studies of long-term concentrations of ambient air pollution and mortality: the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS II) cohort and the Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort (CanCHEC). We then estimate the number of deaths attributable to changes in fine particulate matter concentrations over the 2000 to 2010 time period in both Canada and the USA using both linear and non-linear hazard function models.</P><P><B>Electronic supplementary material</B></P><P>The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s11869-016-0398-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</P>"

dna methylation changes in extracellular remodeling pathway genes during the transformation of human mesenchymal stem cells,2016,"['DNA methylation', 'ECM remodeling pathway', 'Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)', 'Transformation']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules are essential structural components that exhibit important functional roles in the control of key cellular events, including cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The ECM remodeling pathway is also important for tumorigenesis and the metastatic progression of cancer. In this study, we determined the methylation pattern of nineteen ECM genes in colon cancer cell lines and demonstrated that these genes were frequently hypermethylated in primary colon tissues. Upon extracting gene expression profile data of the mouse epithelium and mesenchymal compartments, we found that several ECM genes (CD109, EVL, FBN2, FLNC, IGFBP3, MMP2, and LAMA1) were highly expressed in the mesenchymal compartment.These results were confirmed via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis. Moreover, we demonstrated the correlation between transcriptional silencing and the promoter hypermethylation of LAMA1, FBN2, and IGFBP3 during the transformation of the mesenchymal stem cell model system using key genetic alterations that develop during human malignance. Interestingly, MMP2, IGFBP3, and LAMA1 mRNA levels were significantly decreased during the transformation. In terms of transcriptional silencing by promoter DNA hypermethylation, the lack of LAMA1 mRNA expression was associated with its promoter hypermethylation in the last step of transformation, which develops to malignancies. Overall, our data suggest that ECM alterations by hypermethylated genes may contribute to carcinogenesis through the silencing of ECM pathway genes by epigenetic alterations."

In this study, we therefore tried to suggest the more effective way to transform the height information were constructed separately according to each height datum on land and sea to those on the unique height datum using precise geoid models and tidal observations in Korea. For this, Anmyeon island was selected as a study area to develop the precise geoid models based on the height datums land (IMSL) and sea (LMSL), respectively. In order to develop two hybrid geoid models based on each height datum of land an sea, we firstly develop a precise gravimetric geoid model using the remove and restore (R-R) technique with all available gravity observations. The gravimetric geoid model were then fitted to the geometric geoidal heights, each of which is represented as height datum of land or sea respectively, obtained from GPS/Leveling results on 15 TBMs in the study area. Finally, we determined the differences between the two hybrid geoid models to apply the height transformation between IMSL and LMSL. The co-tidal chart model of TideBed system developed by Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency (KHOA) which was re-gridded to have the same grid size and coverage as the geoid model, in order that this can be used for the height datum transformation from LMSL to local AHHW and/or from LMSL to local DL. The accuracy of height datum transformation based on the strategy suggested in this study was approximately ±3 cm. It is expected that the results of this study can help minimize not only the confusions on the use of geo-spatial information due to the disagreement caused by different height datum, land and sea, in Korea, but also the economic and time losses in the execution of coastal development and disaster prevention projects in the future."

The scope of this study runs the gamut from early 2000s when transformable fashions combined with technology came into surface in earnest to today. The research findings are as follows. First, the concept of being ‘transformable’ and the background of its appearance have been explained by de-constructivism of post modernism and a combination between fashion and technology. Second , transformable textiles have been classified into self-transformation, awareness of surrounding environment, and user interaction before analyzing their characteristics, respectively.

First, multilateral indeterminacy has been expressed in open form that is to be completed freely depending on users and environment. Second, visual pleasure has turned out to bring interest from a brand new form and totally unexpected surprise. Third, complex ornamentation has been built in a new aesthetic quality obtained through a mix & match of heterogeneous textiles. Fourth, 3-dimensional spatiality has been shown in the cubic effect and spatial sense shown in two-dimensional flat textiles.

Using a small number of adjustable parameters, and only two macroscopic tensile stress strain curves for calibration, the model is able to capture, quantitatively, the trends in multiple data sets, including grain-level elastic lattice strains, and diffraction peak intensity changes due to lattice re-orientation associated with twinning. For twinning, the model assumes a polar critical resolved shear stress activation criterion and assigns the stress and hardening of the parent crystal to a newly formed twin. The model allows twinning to be driven either by the stress in the parent crystal (matrix reduction), in which case all of the twin transformation strain is assigned to the matrix, or by the stress in the twin (twin propagation), in which case all of the twin transformation strain is assigned to the twin. A detailed comparison between the model predictions and the neutron diffraction data reveals that assigning all of the twin transformation strain either to the matrix or to the twin is too one-sided, leading to excessive relaxation and hardening effects. A more equitable partitioning of the twin transformation strain is necessary. It is suggested that the stress and hardening assigned to a newly formed twin is of less importance to the performance of the model than the partitioning of the twin transformation strain.

This paper introduces value theory into the emergency and disaster management field to assess why government organizations explain the reasons of disaster reason differently. Among the eight core values in public administration, economy, efficiency, effectiveness, and leadership are classified into hard values, whereas accountability, transparency, ethics, and professionalism are classified into soft values. This study found that a value focus may change in different disaster management stages. It is argued that the hard value oriented disaster management model should make China faster to response disasters, while the soft value oriented disaster management model should make China safer and lead to good governance."
modelling batch bioreactions with continuous process simulators,2016,"['Process Simulation', 'Bioreactor', 'Batch Processing', 'Dairy Processing']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Process models are increasingly becoming necessary for process understanding and optimizing. However, in the field of bioprocessing, modelling using a generic process simulator suffers from shortcomings given that many simulators cannot model batch mode bioreactors with varying reaction rates based on microbial metabolism. Bioprocesses, mostly batch, are difficult to model because most of the available unit operations in process simulators operate continuously. Our aim is to provide a general simulation platform to model these batch bioprocesses in commercial process simulators and explain how to transform batch processes with varying reaction rate into continuous unit operations for simulation purposes. Two typical fermentation processes, lactose fermentation and glucose/xylose co-fermentation, were simulated in steady state as case studies. The results are discussed as examples using the proposed approach. The potential of how to extend the simulation platform is also explained in detail."

Supplementation with ASE 0.1% and 0.5% effectively lowered levels of glucose, insulin, oral glucose tolerance test, and Homa-insulin resistance, suggesting reduced insulin resistance. Blood levels of HbA1c and AGEs were significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner. As oxidative stress plays a key role in accelerating production of HbA1c and AGEs, which worsen symptoms of type 2 diabetes, levels of malonaldehyde and pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured. Lipid peroxidation in both blood and liver tissues was significantly reduced, and induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-β and tumor necrosis factor-α, which elevate production of HbA1c and AGEs, was inhibited (P<0.05). To evaluate the possible cellular events after AGEs receptor activation, genetic expression of protein kinase C (PKC)-δ and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Supplementation with both ASE 0.1% and 0.5% significantly inhibited mRNA expression of PKC-δ and TGF-β, indicating that ASE may have beneficial effects on preventing insulin-resistant cells or tissues from progressing to diabetic complications. Taken together, ASE has potential to improve type 2 diabetes by inhibiting insulin resistance and protein glycosylation, including production of HbA1c and AGEs. Anti-oxidative activities of ASE are a main requisite for reducing production of HbA1c and AGEs and are also related to regulation of the PKC signaling pathway, resulting in suppression of TGF-β, which increases synthesis of collagen, prostaglandin, and disease-related proteins."
automotive window seal design considering external aerodynamic load and surrogate constraint modeling,2016,"['Aerodynamic load', 'Surrogate constraint modeling', 'Automotive window seal', 'Numerical analysis']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"−Installed between metallic DIW (Door in White) panel and nonmetallic door glass, automotive window seals has great influence on customers’ perception of NVH (Noise-Vibration-Harshness) performance. Recently, aerodynamic effect on ride comfort attracts increasing research interest. The external load causes unsteady pressure on glass, which is finally transferred to window seals and leads to complicated vibration and increases interior noise level. However, non-linearities of hyper-elastic material, rubber-glass contact and large deformation behavior make the construction of window seals constraint model much more difficult, thus impeding further analysis and optimization. A new window seal design method is proposed featuring in considering aerodynamics-induced load and nonlinear constraint. Firstly, by SST− k − ε (Shear Stress Transport) turbulence model, external flow field of full-scale automotive is established by solving three-dimensional, steady and uncompressible Navier-Stokes equation. With re-exploited mapping algorithm, the overall aerodynamic pressure is extracted and matched to local window as external loads for seals, thus taking into account high speed fluid-structure interaction.Secondly, based on functional equivalence and mathematical fitting, new surrogate constraint model is presented. The unitedseal CLD (Compression Load Deflection) curve is synthesized after translations and transformations from two semi-seal CLD experimental measurements of inner and outer lips. It is then fit to complex exponential function, making seal constraint equivalent to a surrogate elastic constraint with variable stiffness. Experiment is performed to verify the constraint surrogation effectiveness. Finally, case study of window seal design under high speed is investigated. After seal optimization based on the new method, windows seals’ maximal displacements have decreased. The improved seal-glass fitting status shows better NVH quality of window seal in high-speed condition."

In particular, the substructuring scheme was selectively employed for a certain type of design parameters to enhance the efficiency of the optimization. For the design optimization of size parameters, the parameters are affinely decomposed from the system matrices. Therefore, it is easy to reduce the full order model by using various reduction techniques, i.e., proper orthogonal decomposition. On the other hand, the shape parameters cannot be exactly decomposed due to the non-affine characteristics. In this case, we need to apply the congruence transformation in order to interpolate the each reduction mode in Euclidean space. Various design optimization examples are studied to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed IBPROM."

Moreover, an integration of digital infrastructures with the physical city infrastructure and facilities is taking place. This integration includes data generating sensors and various internet-connected devices which are dispersed in a city having as a target to offer a variety of services in order to ease citizens’ daily lives. In this, so called, smart city digital ecosystem, companies provide eBusiness models that are based on Collective Intelligence based decision making applications focusing on discovering citizens’ needs by collecting data related to their activities. However, the lack of privacy preserving mechanisms in such applications that eliminate the risk of correlation between citizens’ activities and their identities discourages citizens from providing their data to commerce systems. In this paper, we first discuss a new privacy preserving authentication technology, the Privacy-ABCs, and its successful deployment in a course evaluation pilot in higher education as well as a social networking application for pupils in a school environment. Based on the wide acceptance of this technology by the pilot users, we propose the deployment of a Privacy-ABCs based authentication system in a generic Collective Intelligent eBusiness model in a Smart City. The incorporation of this authentication technology in Collective Intelligence based eServices, has the potential of establishing new market opportunities since citizens’ anonymity will increase their incentives to provide valuable data related to their consuming activities and buying preferences as they move about in the city."

robust and fast 3-d scan registration using normal distributions transform with supervoxel segmentation,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<B>SUMMARY</B><P>This paper presents what is termed as the supervoxel normal distributions transform (SV-NDT), a novel three-dimensional (3-D) registration algorithm which improves the performance of the three-dimensional normal distributions transform (3-D NDT) significantly. The 3-D NDT partitions a model scan using a 3-D regular grid. Generating normal distributions using the 3-D regular grid causes considerable information loss because the 3-D regular grid does not use any information pertaining to the local surface structures of the model scan. The best type of surface (the constituent unit of each scan) for modeling with one normal distribution is known to be the plane. The SV-NDT reduces the loss of information using a supervoxel-generating algorithm at the partitioning stage. In addition, it uses the information of the local surface structures from the data scan by replacing the Euclidean distance with a function that uses local geometries as well as the Euclidean distance when each point in the data scan is matched to the corresponding normal distribution. Experiments demonstrate that the use of the supervoxel-generating algorithm increases the modeling accuracy of the normal distributions and that the proposed 3-D registration algorithm outperforms the 3-D NDT and other widely used 3-D registration algorithms in terms of robustness and speed on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Additionally, the effect of changing the function to create correspondences is also verified.</P>"

a topological transformation and hierarchical compensation capacitor control in segmented on-road charging system for electrical vehicles,2016,"['Hierarchical compensation capacitor control', 'Receiving power', 'Segmented on-road charging', 'Topological transformation']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Experiencing power declines when the secondary coil is at the middle position between two primary coils is a serious problem in segmented on-road charging systems with a single energized segmented primary coil. In this paper, the topological transformation of a primary circuit and a hierarchical compensation capacitor control are proposed. Firstly, the corresponding compensation capacitors and receiving powers of different primary structures are deduced under the condition of a fixed frequency. Then the receiving power characteristics as a function of the position variations in systems with a single energized segmented primary coil and those with double segmented primary coils are analyzed comparatively. A topological transformation of the primary circuit and hierarchical compensation capacitor control are further introduced to solve the foregoing problem. Finally, an experimental prototype with the proposed topological transformation and hierarchical compensation capacitor control is carried out. Measured results show that the receiving power is a lot more stable in the movement of the secondary coil. It is a remarkable fact that the receiving power rises from 10.8W to 19.2W at the middle position between the two primary coils. The experimental are in agreement with the theoretical analysis."

Over the past 10 years, the concern on coaching in secular world has been rapidly growing and a considerable number of studies have been conducted on various fields of coaching. However, there seems to be no established theory to explain Christian coaching, especially missional coaching. This study will contribute to put first step on the study of the missional coaching.  To explain missional coaching, I dealt with a triangular pyramid structure of the leadership which was already by my study on Christian leadership in 2009. From this perspective, missional coaching has following meanings. (1) Effective tool for discovering his or her own design of God and fulfilling God’s purpose for him and her. (2) Amazing way for equipping God’s people (3) Wonderful method to discover God’s mission in this global village (4) New way of transforming churches and mission fields (5) Incarnational way of building Kingdom on earth.  On missional coaching skill, I dealt with following two issues. (1) Deep listening with God’s heart 2) Life-changing questions of Trion God. Important missional coaching fields would be as follows. (1) Christian leadership development coaching (2) Christian life coaching (3) Christian career coaching (4) Christian behavior change coaching (5) Coaching for restructuring church and missions (6) Ministrial/Missional strategy development coaching  Missional coaching institutes should work for following fields. (1) Study on missional coaching (2) Missional coaching strategy development (3) Training for missional coaches (4) Coaching the church and mission fields.  I expect that missional coaching will be a powerful tool of the church for mission in the 21st century."
investigation of degradative signals on outdoor solid insulators using continuous wavelet transform,2016,"['Continuous wavelet transform', 'Breakdown', 'Solid insulator', 'Tracking', 'Discharge', 'Leakage']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Most outdoor solid insulators may suffer from surface degradations due to non-stationary currents that flow on the insulator surface. These currents may be classified as leakage, discharge and tracking currents due to their disturbing potencies respectively. The magnitude of these currents depends on the degree of the contamination of surface. The leakage signals are followed by discharge signals and tracking signals which are capable of forming carbonized tracking paths on the surface between high voltage and earth contacts (surface tracking). Surface tracking is one of the most breakdown mechanisms observed on the solid insulators, especially polymers which may cause severely reduced lifetime. In this study the degradations observed on polyester resin based insulators are investigated according to the IEC 587 Inclined Plane Test Standard. The signals are monitored and recorded during tests until surface tracking initiated. In order to prevent total breakdown of an insulator, early detection of tracking signals is vital. Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is proposed for classification of signals and their energy levels observed on the surface. The application of CWT for processing and classification of the surface signals which are prone to display high frequency oscillations can facilitate real time monitoring of the system for diagnosis."

The common consensus is, as Korean and Chinese have shared a long history of geo-graphical and anthropological contact, numerous Chinese lexical words has been borrowed, or loaned to Korean. Yet due to the differences in typology of the two languages, grammatical phenomenon would prove more difficult to transfer. The crux of grammatical replication states that even if two languages experience different grammatical phenomena as long as geographical and anthropological contacts are established, the grammatical phenomenon of one language can be transferred to the other Numerous European Languages` history of transferring from other grammati-cal systems through grammatical replication has been an issue of many discussions and research as of late. With this established, the grammaticalization that allowed verb to transform to adposition in Chinese was replicated (transferred) to the trans-formation from verb to postposition in Korean. This replication processes is essen- tial in establishing a universal model for grammatical replication. As grammatical replication is most evident in the field of literary translations, the undisputable rule of correspondence can be seen in the likes of DWUSI ENHAI(杜詩諺解, translation of poem of DUFU(杜甫)) and the translated version of LAO QIDA(老乞大)."

Magnetic stimulation can be also exploited to regulate the release of pharmaceutical drugs, growth factors, and cells from hydrogels in a controlled manner, on-demand. In the present study, alginate ferrogels containing iron oxide nanoparticles were fabricated via ionic cross-linking, and their various characteristics were investigated. The deformation of the ferrogels was dependent on the polymer concentration, calcium concentration, iron oxide concentration, and strength of magnetic field. To modulate the release of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) under magnetic stimulation, alginate was chemically modified with heparin, as TGF-β1 has a heparin-binding domain. Alginate was first modified with ethylenediamine, and heparin was then conjugated to the ethylenediamine-modified alginate via carbodiimide chemistry. Conjugation of heparin to alginate was confirmed by infrared spectroscopy and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Sustained release of TGF-β1 from alginate-<I>g</I>-heparin ferrogels was achieved, and application of a magnetic field to the ferrogels regulated TGF-β1 release, resultantly enhancing chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cells, which were used as a model chondrogenic cell line.

medical image fusion via non-subsampled contourlet transform,2016,"['non-subsample contourlet transform', 'image fusion', 'region average energy', 'region coefficient deviation']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Due to the obvious advantages, the technology of medical imaging has been widely utilized in the medical areas. Commonly, the medical images of different imaging mechanism are able to guide the radiologist for the precise diagnosis of disease and for more effective interventional treatment procedures. Consequently, the fusion of different medical images of the same scene is necessary. This paper proposes a novel fusion technique for medical images based on non-subsampled contourlet transform (NSCT). Due to the better competence of image information capturing, NSCT is utilized to conduct the multi-scale and multi-directional decompositions of source images. In addition, the models of both region average energy and region coefficient deviation are used for the fusion for low-frequency sub-images and high-frequency ones, respectively. In comparison with several current typical fusion techniques, the proposed one has remarked superiorities in terms of both subjective and objective evaluations."

Principal component analysis (PCA) and subsequent partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were able to discriminate five Citrus lines into three separate clusters corresponding to their taxonomic relationships. The quantitative predictive modeling of sugar and acid contents from Citrus fruits was established using partial least square regression algorithms from FT-IR spectra. The regression coefficients (R<SUP>2</SUP>) between predicted values and estimated sugar and acid content values were 0.99. These results demonstrate that by using FT-IR spectra and applying quantitative prediction modeling to Citrus sugar and acid contents, excellent Citrus lines can be early detected with greater accuracy."

no-reference image quality assessment using complex characteristics of shearlet transform,2016,"['Image quality measure', 'no-reference', 'complex shearlet transform', 'SVM']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The field of Image Quality Measure (IQM) is growing rapidly in recent years. In particular, there was a significant progress in No-Reference (NR) IQM methods. In this paper, a general-purpose NR IQM algorithm is proposed based on the statistical characteristics of natural images in shearlet domain. The method utilizes a set of distortion-sensitive features extracted from statistical properties of shearlet coefficients. A complex version of the shearlet transform is employed to take advantage of phase and amplitude features in quality estimation. Furthermore, since shearlet transform can analyze the images at multiple scales, the effect of distortion on across-scale dependencies of shearlet coefficients is explored for feature extraction. For quality prediction, the features are used to train image classification and quality prediction models using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The experimental results show that the proposed NR IQM is highly correlated with human subjective assessment and outperforms several Full-Reference (FR) and state-of-art NR IQMs."

This paper introduces value theory into emergency and disaster management field to assess why different government organizations have two different disaster reason explanations. There are eight core values in public administration, among them, economy, efficiency, effectiveness, and leadership can be classified into hard values, and accountability, transparency, ethics, and professionalism can be classified into soft values. Due to the analysis of train disaster management process, this study found a value transformation in disaster management process, which is in the mitigation, preparation, and response stages, the Chinese government mainly focuses on hard values and lost public trust, and in the recovery stages, the Chinese government turns to soft values and tries to gain the public trust that will answer the question of two explanations. The soft value-oriented disaster management model will also make China safer and lead to good governance."
image quality assessment with saliency map in nonsubsampled contourlet transform domain,2016,"['Image quality assessment (IQA)', 'Nonsubsampled Contourlet Transform (NSCT)', 'saliency map']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Many researchers evaluate images by objective image quality assessments instead of subjective ones. Objective image quality assessment sets up mathematical model according to the human visual system, and it evaluates the image quality through the reference image and the distorted image. The Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) is one of the most classical methods in image quality assessment. However, SSIM has several inherent shortcomings. First, SSIM does not take spatial position, spatial frequency, or direction into account. Second, SSIM considers that different regions in an image have equal importance for overall image quality assessment. Third, it is unreasonable to use fixed parameters for various images. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a new method of image quality assessment based on Nonsubsampled Contourlet Transform (NSCT). Firstly, NSCT is performed to decompose the image into a low-pass map and high-pass ones. Then, low-pass and high-pass maps are respectively assessed with different strategies. In addition, saliency map is added to describe the importance of different regions in an image. Last, we proposed an approach to calculate the adaptive parameters for various images. Experimental comparisons among five public benchmark databases demonstrate that the proposed method is better than other competing methods."
segmentation of the synthetic aperture radar image using the watershed transformation and region merging technique,2016,"['Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)', 'Image segmentation', 'Watershed transformation', 'Region adjacency graph (RAG)']",국문 초록 정보 없음,This paper presents an efficient algorithm that segments the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image into several homogeneous regions by combining edge- and region-based information. A multi-direction ratio edge detector is used to capture the locally directional variation information of a SAR image and construct the ratio edge strength map (RESM) of the SAR image. Watershed transformation is performed on the thresholded RESM to obtain an over-segmentation result. An efficient hierarchical region merging procedure based on the region adjacency graph representation of the image regions is proposed. A novel dissimilarity measurement between the two adjacent regions is derived from the multiplicative noise speckle model of the multi-look SAR image. Experimental results and the performance evaluation show that the proposed method outperforms two widely used SAR image segmentation approaches.

Methods: A classification model for viable seeds was developed using partial least square discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) with Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) and Raman spectroscopic data in the range of $9080-4150cm^{-1}$ (1400-2400 nm) and $1800-970cm^{-1}$, respectively. The datasets were divided into 70% to calibration and 30% to validation. To reduce noise from the spectra and compare the classification results, preprocessing methods, such as mean, maximum, and range normalization, multivariate scattering correction, standard normal variate, and $1^{st}$ and $2^{nd}$ derivatives with the Savitzky-Golay algorithm were used. Results: The classification accuracies for calibration using FT-NIR and Raman spectroscopy were both 99% with first derivative, whereas the validation accuracies were 90.5% with both multivariate scattering correction and standard normal variate, and 96.4% with the raw data (non-preprocessed data). Conclusions: These results indicate that FT-NIR and Raman spectroscopy are valuable tools for a feasible classification and evaluation of viable pepper seeds by providing useful information based on PLS-DA and the threshold value."

The generalized Gaussian quadrature nodes and weights for one dimension are used in the derived integration formula for evaluating the results. The results obtained for seven different functions are tabulated along with a comparative study in order to show that the proposed method gives more accurate results using less number of quadrature points and is the optimal one."

The wavelet packet decomposition is accomplished by analyzing the different wavelet transform coefficient distribution characteristics of the signal and the noise. The speech signal is stratified to determine the best wavelet packet decomposition tree, the threshold value is quantified, and the wavelet packet decomposition is completed. The threshold value can be used to eliminate signal noise. Finally, the transmitted signal is reconstructed by the inverse transformation of the wavelet packet. The computer simulation results show that the method of wavelet packet decomposition is worked for the speech signal processing in the OFDM underwater acoustic communication system. For the speech signal transferred in the underwater acoustic channel, the noise can be eliminated and the valid signal can be kept effectively."

In order to handle ontology data change situation, a version handling system is needed to keep track of changes. For example, the queries subject to the previous ontology may become inconsistent and must be updated according to the newest version of ontology. Although many research was done in this area, there are still many problems to overcome. In this paper, we propose class and property transition graph for query transformation. The graph is created when ontology data is changed and applied to query transformation."

Furthermore, the mediating effect, which was expected to be highly relevant on the grounds of the findings ofprevious researches that any high trust ofa leader would lead to a high level of OC of members, has been revealed as a complete mediation in the relationship of emotional trust between individual consideration and OC, which shows that the correlation between TL and OC may vary depending on the characteristics of an organization and its members both of which are sample objects. This study, unlike most previous researches with their research samples inindustrial fields, has estimated the growing interrelation of NGOs.

modeling of multi agent system: from analysis to design,2016,"['Multi Agent Systems', 'MAS Analysis', 'Templates', 'MAS Design', 'ADL', 'JASON']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Multi Agent System (MAS) is an assembly of autonomous, proactive and dynamic entities called agents. These agents provide some service once an event is invoked. By providing the designated service the MAS achieves a specific goal. A logic based formal analysis of MAS is necessary to understand the system, its structure and dynamics. A systematic and sequential methodology is used for analysis of MAS. As a result of analysis several constructs in form of templates is obtained to represent the different facets of MAS. This is extremely necessary as it allows to explicitly identify how agents directly or indirectly interact or coordinate and collaborate with each other. This paper proposes an Architectural Design Language called Agent Description Language (ADL) that will be required to map these analysis templates to the design phase. Establishing the correctness of the structural transformation and correspondence from analysis to design phase constitutes the other side of the proposal. The proposed ADL has been used to get the corresponding classes of the templates generated. Jason, the universal MAS programming language has been used to implement the ADL classes to get the logical design which conforms to the conceptual design phase. The case study of Medical Emergency Service (MES) has also been taken to illustrate the proposals and findings."
landwirtschaftliche genossenschaften im prozess einer wiedervereinigung modernisierung des genossenschaftsrechts vs. transformation in ein einheitliches recht,2016,"['협동조합', '독일통일', '북한경제', 'Cooperative', 'die deutsche Vereinigung', 'nordkoreanische Wirtschaft']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Die heutige Tagung ist Rechtsfragen einer Wiedervereinigung auf der koreanischen Halbinsel gewidmet. In welcher Form diese Wiedervereinigung vollzogen werden wird, wissen wir heute noch nicht. Deshalb möchte ich im folgenden mein Thema auf der Grundlage zweier unterschiedlicher Szenarien behandeln. Das erste Szenario fußt auf der June 15th North-South Joint Declaration (2000), die von einer Wiedervereinigung in der Form einer Konföderation – so die Vorstellung des Südens – bzw. von einer losen Föderation – so der Vorschlag des Nordens – spricht, wobei nach dem Vorschlag Kim Il Sungs vom Oktober 1980 die Gesellschaftssysteme beider Teile Koreas koexistieren sollten. Diese Declaration ist aus nordkoreanischer Sicht immer noch aktuell. Der nordkoreanische Außenminister Ri Su Yong hat auf der UNO-Vollversammlung am 27.9.2014 eine Konföderation mit zwei Systemen in einem Land angeregt. In seiner Neujahrsansprache 2016 hat Marschall (Wonsu) Kim Jong Un einer Veränderung des Systems in Nordkorea und einer einseitigen Systemvereinigung eine Absage erteilt. Erst kürzlich wieder hat Nordkorea das Modell der Wiedervereinigung Deutschlands für Korea abgelehnt. Darum empfehlen auch in Südkorea manche Wissenschaftler, das politische Vorgehen zunächst auf der Basis einer low-level confederation der beiden Koreas statt auf der Grundlage einer vielleicht erst später möglichen vollständigen Wiedervereinigung zu planen. Deshalb gehe ich im ersten Teil meines Vortrags von einem Fortbestand des nordkoreanischen Wirtschaftssystems und seiner landwirtschaftlichen Genossenschaften in einem Wiedervereinigungsprozess aus. Dieser erste Teil meiner Präsentation fußt auf einem Vortrag, den ich im September 2014 an der Kim Il Sung-Universität in Pyongyang gehalten habe und der in einem Publikationsorgan der Kim Il Sung-Universität veröffentlicht werden wird.

However the researches for forecasting of wildfire are limited to individual approaches to weather, accessibility and duration. In order to overcome that limitations, we first transformed human-caused wildfire data out of total wildfire data from 1991 to 2015, 25 years data, to 5km grid data and utilized that grid based data to the studies. We additionally utilized grid based meteorological information data, global positioning data, and accessibility information data for human access. We utilized co-kriging method to construct meteorological information data based on space interpolation method and utilized altitude data, total number of trail in a grid and shortest distance from regional capital for accessibility information.

I want this model to make the teacher have a new system of knowledge, and make it possible to construct the integrating education of elementary school. With this purpose, I would first analyse the property of the INRC transformation, and the possibility of its application into the educational process of mathematic-scientific and language-social text. In other word, I would like to argue that this structure is not only the principle of mathematical reasoning, but also the linguistical. As an example, I would analyse the concept of proportion in order to see the function of this structure in the thinking of elementary school students. Secondly, I would analyse 8 stages which the teacher of elementary school should understand and fallow: 1) questioning, 2) defining the elementary concept, 3) structuring the relationship between conceptions, 4) expressing the structuralization into propositional form, 5) transforming the propositional form into mathematical form, 6) visualizing the mathematical form into picture or graph, 7) making an application of the structure into concrete situation, 8) searching the contrary example violating this principle.

The imaginary archetype and the principle of maintaining the archetype under the Act posed many conflicts and problems, but the near-extinct Pansori has apparently been able to retain its traditional form up to the present day because it was listed as an intangible heritage within the Act. However, given the changing system of and environment surrounding intangible cultural heritage, there is a pressing need to define the new direction for Pansori. Maintenance of the archetype that has distorted the true implication of the heritage and preservation of Pansori should be changed: Pansori should be inherited and preserved in a totally different direction by changing the archetype concept to a model concept and by adapting to the changing global environment. Embraced by the UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, conditions such as the coexistence of traditionality and modernity, representation, and community features require the establishment of intangible cultural heritage that is open to the world, rather than closed. This requirement is imperative.Pansori needs to be re-contextualized in the intangible cultural heritage system wherein the archetype is transformed to a model. With attention focused on its entertainment features, Pansori should acquire characteristics of festivity or play, shedding its hereto-embraced artistry that anyone can access through ordinary life. If Pansori has previously evolved from festivity and play into an artform, it should now reverse its development direction from art to play and festivity."

Also, I evaluated and measured team mental models similarity and accuracy. Meanwhile, a team leader gets team members understand tasks clearly and accomplish goals of team. Also, team leaders have to demonstrate competencies controlled in activities of team members. At this time, Team leaders need to have leadership. Studies that have been done on team leaderships so far are focused in the roles of leaders that get activities of team done smoothly. In this respect, As roles of leaderships are regarded as means of team performance only meeting functional aspects, We tend to think of overlooking roles of leader that consider team members and put emphasis on relation between leader and team member in a large percentage of cases. Therefore, this study is recognized team leadership as not only task-focused behaviors but also relation-focused behaviors. Transformational leadership and servant leaderships are regards as the most effective leaderships. As a result of that I carried empirical analysis out. So, I set up the model of this study that transformational leadership affect team mental models and team efficacy positively. Results of this study show transformational leadership affect team mental models positively. Team mental models have mediating effect. That cognitive processes take place in interaction of team member is affected by team leaderships. Team mental modes are related to efficacy for their teams."

Respecting the totalistic nature of competence, I propose a metaphor of identity as a post-functionalistic model of curriculum development with a warm-competence-based curriculum. The term “identity” has taken on a great many different meanings in the literature. I sketch out but one approach that draws on a consistent strand of participation. I propose new directions for the development of an identity-based curriculum, as follows: First, personalized curriculum should be seen as a life project. Designing a personalized curriculum does not mean developing customized courses; instead, the courses should involve self-directed, deep, and long-term learning. The school curriculum should take support for individual learning portfolios as a primary principle in its development. Second, the curriculum should include subject and non-subject contents. A competence-based curriculum requires a critical perspective related to the dualism of knowledge and experience in favor of situated practice. The separation of the subject from non-subject curriculum in the current national curriculum should be re-organized. Third, a community-based curriculum should be developed. Living community features a classroom culture of mutual respect and caring based on practical ethics and the accountability of community members. A learning community allows the school to be transformed into a learning organization where members of the community form their identities. Fourth, a school culture should be fashioned that represents its own character. Competence is encouraged to develop through participation in a culture; this conditions the ecological environment of learning."

Methods: The study participants were 389 hospital nurses. SPSS and AMOS 22.0 program were used to analyze the data and the modeling of turnover intention. Results: A total of 41% of turnover intention was explained by job satisfaction, job embeddedness and organizational characteristics. Nurses with higher job satisfaction and job embeddedness showed lower turnover intention, while organizational characteristics had an indirect effect on their turnover intention. It was found that organizational characteristics had positive effects on both job satisfaction and job embeddedness, and job embeddedness played a mediating role between organizational characteristics and turnover intention. Conclusion: To reduce nurses’ turnover intention, hospitals’ organizational characteristics should be considered. Nurse managers should strive to increase nurses’ job satisfaction and job embeddedness through an understanding of the factors of organizational characteristics such as organizational fairness, nursing work environment, motivation, organizational citizenship behavior, and transformational leadership."

This paper extends the existing MCDM (multi-criteria decision making) method to the situation considering lack of information caused by ignorance of knowledge, especially when lack of information happens at all levels including criteria in the hierarchical decision structure. To hurdle the ambiguity and incompleteness of evaluation process, fuzzy linguistic variables are used when the matrices for criteria and alternatives are built. In addition, to deal with lack of information, Demspter-Shafer (DS) evidential theory is applied to the MCDM evaluation scheme. Belief intervals composed of belief function and plausible function are converted to crisp values through the PPT (pignistic probability transformation) method and the quadratic programming with weighted loss objective function. All of the procedures are implemented in detail for a supplier selection example, which shows the newly proposed MCDM evaluation scheme to be applicable and effective."

the effects of a spokesperson towards a customer's behavioural intentions: the case of an environmental conservation ngo,2016,"['celebrity endorsement', 'spokesperson', 'NGO', 'non-profit-sector', 'source credibility', 'corporate credibility', 'behavioural intentions', 'wildlife management', 'overpopulated animals.']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Introduction The over population of wild and feral animals is increasing as an environmental problem in many parts of the world due the pressure on native flora and ecosystems. (BBC, 2013; Hall, 2015; Kaji, Saitoh, Uno, Matsuda, & Yamamura, 2010). Examples include deer in Northern Japan and Northeast USA, the urban fox in England, possums in New Zealand and the crown of thorns starfish in the Great Barrier Reef. This phenomenon is also happening in Australia. Recent news reports of huge kangaroo populations devastating grazing land in western Queensland (Arthur, 2015) and a spike in Koalas eating away their habitat in the Cape Otway area of Victoria (Paul, 2015) have highlighted this problem. While the overpopulation of koalas is causing environmental damage to natural gum trees, to the point that they will not regenerate, it is difficult to enforce population control because these animals hold such as positive place as an Australian symbolic animal. Hence, there is some controversy whether they should be culled by environment advocates as part of an ongoing population/environmental management program. To help facilitate appropriate wildlife management in light of the controversial environmental problems, Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) play an essential role as a conduit between government and local citizens. For example, Australian Koala Foundation contributes to the conservation and management of the wild Koala through conducting strategic research for Koala management, conservation and community education in Australia (Australian Koala Foundation, 2015). However, NGOs are currently faced with challenges, such as acquisition of funds to support such work and gathering supporters for volunteer activities. This is because the competitiveness in the not-for-profit-sector has intensified due to an increase in the number of NGOs and oligopoly of donation share by high-profile NGOs (Foster & Fine, 2007; Sunder, 2015). To deal with these challenges NGO’s are resorting to more commercial types of marketing communications such as the use of celebrity endorsement or using celebrities as spokespeople. Although using celebrities as spokespeople for the NGO sector has become a common advertising strategy (De los Salmones, Dominguez, & Herrero, 2013; Wheeler, 2009), research into what kind of characteristics of spokesperson would lead effectively to change customer's attitude and behavioural intentions is limited. This celebrity/cause match is especially important for many environmental NGOs who have to deal with controversial environmental problems (e.g. wildlife management for overpopulated animals). This research examines the differences between the relevant expertise and perceived attractiveness of the celebrity spokesperson and its effect on the public’s perception of trustworthiness of the NGO. As the role of the celebrity spokesperson to encourage the public’s intentions to donate increases another issue arises: can the same strategy be used to solicit the donation of time (by volunteers)? This latter dilemma is something that is rarely experienced in the for-profit or commercial sector. This study presents a conceptual model that may help to identify answers to these questions and will extend the current research on celebrity endorsement. It should also bring out new academic insights about the process of building source credibility and a detailed evaluation of the spokesperson’s role in creating a two dimensional approach to behavioural intentions. Literature review Celebrity endorsement is a common advertising technique used by many organisations to build an association between a well-known and well-liked personality and the company’s brand in order to increase consumer’s awareness and liking for the brand (Spry, Pappu, & Bettina Cornwell, 2011). By utilizing the endorsement of a celebrity spokesperson, the product/service, band and/or company is able to leverage the positive attributes and characteristics of the spokesperson to the advantage of that product, band and/or company image (Erdogan, 1999; Ohanian, 1990). Recently, this strategy of utilizing celebrities as credible spokespeople has been adopted by many socially purposed organisations and NGOs (De los Salmones, et al., 2013; Samman, Auliffe, & MacLachlan, 2009; Wheeler, 2009). In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the spokesperson, source credibility is used as a key measure. The source credibility is defined as ‘a communicator's positive characteristics that affect the receiver's acceptance of a message’ (Ohanian, 1990, p. 41). The concept of source credibility has been established through the development of two important models: source credibility model and source attractiveness model. The source credibility model, proposed by Hovland, Janis, and Kelley (1953), suggests that the effectiveness of a message depends on perceived level of expertise and trustworthiness in an endorser (Erdogan, 1999). Hovland, et al. (1953) analyze the factors which lead to the perceived credibility of the spokesperson and defined that two essential items of source credibility namely, expertise and trustworthiness. Moreover, the source attractiveness model, takes a social psychological perspective (McGuire, 1985) and is defined as another important factor that is likely to affect customers’ perception of the brand. The source attractiveness model explains that the effectiveness of a message depends on source's 'familiarity', 'likability', 'similarity', and 'attractiveness' to the respondent (Erdogan, 1999). This model brings about the idea that attractiveness is also a factor determining source credibility. Ohanian (1990) combines these two models and defines the construct of endorser source credibility as consisting of three sub-dimension items (i.e. expertise, trustworthiness, attractiveness). By adopting the source credibility model, researchers have studied the effects of spokesperson on customer's attitudes and behavioural intentions in various research settings and conditions (Amos, Holmes, & Strutton, 2008; Erdogan, 1999; Lafferty & Goldsmith, 1999; Ohanian, 1991). However, a comprehensive review of the literature reveals that some gaps still exist in the work that has been undertaken in this field. Firstly, rather than source credibility consisting of three independent variables (expertise, trustworthiness, attractiveness) Busch and Wilson (1976) and Johnson and Grayson (2005) suggest that for trust building within service marketing and sales research, the constructs of expertise and attractiveness are regarded as antecedent factors of trustworthiness. This approach has not been used in research into celebrity endorsement. Secondly, although most studies have dealt with concept of behavioural intentions as a unidimensional concept, this unidimensional way could make the actual effects of spokesperson unclear because different behavioural intentions may hold different meanings, for different potential sponsors resulting in different forms of donation. In service quality research Zeithaml, Berry, and Parasuraman (1996) confirm that different types of service quality may influence differently any one of five different behavioural intentions (i.e. loyalty, switch, pay more, external response, and internal response). Thus, different types of celebrity endorser (expert or attractive) could also influence different types of behavioural intentions. For example the attributes of celebrity endorser may have an influence on whether someone would be more inclined to donate money, to donate time (volunteer for the organisation), and/or spread positive word of mouth. Conceptual framework & hypotheses development Although this study investigates the effects of the various combinations of endorser's characteristics on customer’s attitudes and behavioural intentions, research shows that different endorser’s characteristics do affect different customer attitudes and behaviour (Eisend & Langner, 2010; Lord & Putrevu, 2009). Lord and Putrevu (2009) find that attractiveness drives customer's behavioural intentions when customer's motivation is transformational (i.e. affective), whereas expertise and trustworthiness are influential when their motivation is informational (i.e. cognitive). Eisend and Langner (2010) reveal that attractiveness is a determinant of positive customer attitudes in the immediate condition (i.e. ad effects after just 60 seconds), whereas expertise is effective in the delayed condition (i.e. ad effects after one or three days). They also found that a high-expertise and high-attractiveness endorser is particularly effective towards customer attitudes in both conditions. Thus, considering the different effects on customer’s attitudes by different endorser’s characteristics our research objective is to examine which type of spokesperson is more effective in influencing a customer's attitudes and behavioural intentions for NGOs dealing with controversial environmental problems. In addition to solving the research objective, the research will also fill the research gaps indicated through the literature review. Our model (See Figure 1) shows that both the expertise and attractiveness of a celebrity spokesperson will lead to consumers’ perception of the trustworthiness of that spokesperson. Considering the insights from the perspective of trust building processes in the services marketing and sales literature, the celebrity’s expertise and/or attractiveness as antecedent factors of trustworthiness should also have an effect on organisation credibility through trustworthiness as a mediator. Moreover, we propose that the effects of a spokesperson’s expertise and/or attractiveness will influence differently the organisational credibility depending on the level of issue controversy they deal with. For example, Wheeler (2009) found that a celebrity endorser that showed a logical connection with the organisation increased organisational credibility and behavioural intentions. Therefore it is expected that for an environmental NGO that has to deal with controversial issues (such as reducing numbers of animals in habitats under stress from overgrazing) an expert spokesperson may well be a better fit and gain more trust and therefore more credibility for the organisation than an attractive one. However, where the issue the spokesperson is dealing with is not controversial this pattern may well reverse with an attractive celebrity being the more effective spokesperson. From this point of view, the level of issue controversy that the NGO deals with is hypothesized as a moderator between both expertise and attractiveness and trustworthiness. The customer’s perception of both the trustworthiness/credibility of the celebrity chosen as spokesperson and the credibility of the organisation will influence their (the customer’s) attitudes toward the organisation. In the model we follow Amos, et al. (2008) and Erdogan (1999) in asserting that positive organisational credibility will positively influence attitudes toward the firm. From the view that a unidimensional behavioural intention could make actual outcomes unclear, three behavioural intentions (i.e. donation of time, donation of money, word of mouth) options are proposed. This distinction is especially important when considering that many NGOs unlike for-profit organisations have a need to both increase financial resources and human resources. The NGO/celebrity endorser conceptual model is presented in figure 1. Conclusion & future research direction The conceptual model developed in this study research has implications for both academics and managers. Firstly, as an academic contribution, the idea that expertise and attractiveness contributes to trustworthiness, which is reported in trust building in service marketing, should raise new considerations about source credibility building process in celebrity endorsement research. Moreover, the moderating influence of the degree of controversy will play an important part in that relationship, especially for NGOs having to deal with controversial issues such as culling wildlife to protect the environment. The approach that multiple types of behavioural intentions are important outcomes may also enable a more detailed evaluation of the effects of celebrity spokespeople. The interactions between spokesperson characteristics (e.g. expertise, attractiveness) and the three behavioural intentions should be further investigated within the celebrity endorser field of research. Secondly, since the literature which evaluates the effect of celebrity endorsement for NGOs in the context of controversial social issues has been still under-researched, the outcomes of this research will be valuable for most NGO managers struggling with same issues. Moreover, by applying multiple behavioural intentions, more detailed insights how to increase each behavioural intention (i.e. donation of money, donation of time, positive word of mouth) through assigning different spokesperson with different characteristics (i.e. attractiveness and expertise) may enable NGOs to more flexible in assigning a suitable spokesperson. The characteristics of the spokesperson may need to change depending on the resource acquisition requirements the NGO has at that time. Hence, this research will provide meaningful insights from the both academic and managerial perspectives. As a future research direction, in order to validate this conceptual model it is suggested that a between subjects experiment be conducted. The experiment could consist of a scenario whereby a spokesperson is trying to gain public support for the activities of an environmental NGO. Here one could manipulate the expertise (high vs low) and the attractiveness (high vs low) of the spokesperson and the message (controversial vs non-controversial) to establish if differences in the spokesperson characteristics would have an effect on the different behavioural intentions of the respondents."

This paper is aimed at theory, practicality and operability, and hoping to choose the provider which can guarantee the cost is smallest by introducing the original provider model. Among all the aspects, this paper is persuasive. Meanwhile, due to the instability of the relevant data which are collected, the factors impacting upon the total cost are uncertain, thus their credibility is affected. Later, according to the actual demand of the logistics service provider as well as the Benefit-Cost Ratio in aggregate cost method, the qualitative method and the quantitative method are combined with each other, and then the cost can be reduced through Analytic Hierarchy Process. Moreover, the factors which are irrelevant to cost selection are reasonably transformed into the cost adjustment proportion, and an improved provider selection model is established. At last, by introducing the specific case of the third party logistics service provider of Chemical Enterprise A, the effectiveness in practical application of improving the provider selection model can be verified."

The win-win growth of business refers to corporate efforts undertaken by companies to pursue the healthiness of business between conglomerates and partnering companies such as suppliers for mutual prosperity and a long-term corporate soundness based on their business ecosystem and cooperative strategies. This study is designed to validate a theoretical proposition that the win-win growth strategy of Samsung Electronics and cooperative efforts among companies can create a healthy business ecosystem, based on results of case studies and surveys. In this study, a level of global market access of small and mid-sized companies is adopted as the key achievement index. The foreign market entry is considered as one of vulnerabilities in the ecosystem of small and mid-sized enterprises (SMEs). For SMEs, the global market access based on the research and development (R&D) has become the critical component in the process of transforming them into global small giants. The results of case studies and surveys are analyzed mainly based on a model of a virtuous cycle of Creativity, Opportunity, Productivity, and Proactivity (the COPP model) that features the characteristics of the healthiness of a business ecosystem. In the COPP model, a virtuous circle of profits made by the first three factors and Proactivity, which is the manifestation of entrepreneurship that proactively invests and reacts to the changing business environment of the future, enhances the healthiness of a given business ecosystem. With the application of the COPP model, this study finds major achievements of the win-win growth of Samsung Electronics as follows. First, Opportunity plays a role as a parameter in the relations of Creativity, Productivity, and creating profits. Namely, as companies export more (with more Opportunity), they are more likely to link their R&D efforts to Productivity and profitability. However, companies that do not export tend to fail to link their R&D investment to profitability. Second, this study finds that companies with huge investment on R&D for the future, which is the result of Proactivity, tend to hold a large number of patents (Creativity). And companies with significant numbers of patents tend to be large exporters as well (Opportunity), and companies with a large amount of exports tend to record high profitability (Productivity and profitability), and thus forms the virtuous cycle of the COPP model. In addition, to access global markets for sustainable growth, SMEs need to build and strengthen their competitiveness. This study concludes that companies with a high level of proactivity to invest for the future can create a virtuous circle of Creativity, Opportunity, Productivity, and Proactivity, thereby providing a strategic implication that SMEs should invest time and resources in forming such a virtuous cycle which is a sure way for the SMEs to grow into global small giants."

Factors associated with tumor microenvironment including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX-2), transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-!1), CD31, and serum interleukin- 6 (IL-6) were evaluated. Tumor-infiltrating regulatory immune cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were also analyzed.Results A higher number of lung metastases were observed in the orthotopic tumor model than in the heterotopic tumor model. VEGF, CD31, COX-2, and TGF-!1 expression was more prominent in the orthotopic tumor model than in the heterotopic tumor model. Expression of the angiogenic factor VEGF and key regulatory molecules (TGF-!1 and COX-2) decreased following radiation in the orthotopic tumor model, while the serum IL-6 level increased after radiation. In the orthotopic tumor model, the number of both Tregs and MDSCs in the tumor burden decreased after radiation.Conclusion The orthotopic tumor model showed higher metastatic potential and more aggressive molecular features than the heterotopic tumor model. These findings suggest that the orthotopic tumor mouse model may be more reflective of the tumor microenvironment and suitable for use in the translational research of radiation treatment."
세계와 한국의 복권정책에 관한 연구,2016,"['복권정책', '위험산업', '거버넌스', 'Lottery Policy', 'Risk Industry', 'Governance']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This study had conducted the case analysis of regulation about lottery policy in Korea and World. The research analysis is based on the gambling industry regulation model (Kingma, 2008), policy type(Lowi, 1964; 1972) and governance theory(Rhodes, 1996). There are three regulation model with Prohibit Model, Alibi Model and Risk Model. Research scopes of case study are 9 countries for three different regulation model. The result of case analysis is as followed: as identified by the theoretical contemplation, the lottery policies have been changed by regulation model and policy type about lottery. Prohibit Model deals with a social problem, such as gambling that proliferated before the establishment of governments in islam countries. Alibi Model refers justified policy for the lottery issued for the public welfare countries like USA, Japan, Korea. Risk Model refers to the economic phenomenon after the spread of recent internet technology throughout not only the lottery industry, but also all areas of society and the international game market like UK, Norway and Swissland. As a result of global lottery status analysis based on the review of preceding documents, it was confirmed that the global lottery market has transformed as described by the Risk Model. Under such international environment, the regulation such as annual sales cap contemplated in Korea is believed to be ineffective. The game market is growing day by day and the types of game are also multiplying. The lottery is also becoming an area of entertainment globally, and the global players can freely purchase lotteries of other jurisdictions through the internet. Globalization is no longer an option, but a matter of survival also in the lottery industry. Korea must join the governance of international gaming industry in a variety of perspectives, such as policy, system, culture and so on."

material feature representation and identification with composite surfacelets,2016,"['Heterogeneous modeling', 'Implicit surface', 'Feature identification', 'Surfacelet transform']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Computer-aided materials design requires new modeling approaches to characterize and represent fine-grained geometric structures and material compositions at multiple scales. Recently, a dual-Rep approach was developed to model materials microstructures based on a new basis function, called surfacelet. As a combination of implicit surface and wavelets, surfacelets can efficiently identify and represent planar, cylindrical, and ellipsoidal geometries in material microstructures and describe the distribution of compositions and properties. In this paper, these primitive surfacelets are extended and composite surfacelets are proposed to model more complex geometries. Composite surfacelets are constructed by Boolean operations on the primitives. The surfacelet transform is applied to match geometric features in three-dimensional images. The composition of the material near the identified features can then be modeled. A cubic surfacelet and a v-joint surfacelet are developed to demonstrate the reverse engineering process of retrieving material compositions from material images."

This study addresses the stochastic versions of WTAP, in which data, such as the probability of destroying a target, are given randomly (i.e., data are identified with certain probability distributions). For each type of random data or parameter, we provide a stochastic optimization model on the basis of the expected value or scenario enumeration. In particular, when the probabilities of destroying targets depending on weapons are stochastic, we present a stochastic programming formulation with a simple recourse. We show that the stochastic model can be transformed into a deterministic equivalent mixed integer programming model under a certain discrete probability distribution of randomness. We solve the stochastic model to obtain an optimal solution via the mixed integer programming model and compare this solution with that of the deterministic model."

To generate sets of input and output data for training and validating the proposed W-TANFIS models, experimental studies were performed on a smart reinforced concrete beam under a variety of impact loads. The impact forces and current signals on an MR damper were used as input signals for training the W-TANFIS to predict the acceleration, deflection, and strain responses. As a benchmark, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was used. It was demonstrated that the proposed W-TANFIS framework is effective in anticipating the structural responses of the reinforced concrete beam-MR damper system subjected to impact loading. In addition, the comparison of the W-TANFIS and ANFIS models demonstrated that the W-TANFIS model has better performance over the ANFIS model.</P>"

Thus he anticipates emancipation from dominance if the original form of lifeworld can be restored through reflection, discussion, and communicative action.Planning administering modern society has been guided by the rational planning model that emphasizes means rather than ends. Fundamental problems of such planning practice is that it can be used for justification of human alienation and oppression. Further, the legitimacy of objective knowledge advocated by rational planning theory is no longer valid in the real world. In response, communicative or interpretive planning theory were suggested as a reflective alternatives. This approach views that the knowledge is constructed through the process of social interpretation instead of being acquired by exploring the facts objectively exist in the external world through scientific methods. In this regard, planning is a social process where individual’s thoughts, value, and action are actively constructed.Power supply plan based on instrumental rationality reveals the same problems paralleling to those modernity has entailed. It is focused on efficiency to achieve the external objective of ‘cheap and reliable supply’ rather than reflecting ends or directions of the policy. Decision-making process led by experts rejects other valuesand opinions. Linear planning procedures have limitations in dealing with uncertainty and rationale of objective knowledge becomes unconvinced with distortion by political interests.The implicative policy suggestions from the discussion in electricity planning are proposed as follows: First, public arena for unconstrained discourse is necessary.Second, normative energy scenario should be developed and discussed in this public sphere. Lastly, flexible planning process that emphasizes short-term and incremental development of soft technologies and continuous evaluation and learning are necessary."

First, a range bin having an isolated scatterer is selected. Next, polynomial phase signal in the selected range bin is estimated by using both Fourier transform(FT) and polynomial-phase transform(PPT). Finally, a new slow time variable that uniformly samples radar signal along the aspect angle directions is defined by using the estimated phase signal, and we interpolate radar signal in terms of the new time variable. As a result, rotational motion to blurr ISAR images is removed, and focused ISAR images are obtained. Simulation results using battleship model validate the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed RMC method."
"research of comprehensive compensation of harmonics, reactive current and dc bias in uhv power grid",2016,"['Parallel decoupling', 'harmonics', 'Reactive power', 'Multi-level inverter']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"A comprehensive compensation device with paralleled decoupling for suppressing harmonics current, reactive power, and DC Bias of power transformer is proposed. Harmonics current and reactive current are detected by instantaneous reactive power theory. In this way, the fundamental active power is converted to be compensated reactive power and harmonics by controlling the converter. Compared to the ASVG with IGBT, the capacity and withstanding voltage level of ASVG with GTO are improved. The voltage across the devices of APF with multi-level inverter is reduced because of the paralleled decoupling connection. The harmonics compensation with multi-stage inverter can also reduce the voltage across the devices effectively. The reactive power compensator can work as a controllable rectifier and output controllable current by changing control algorithm.

In terms of methods, this discussion begins with the description of H6fer’s statement on the theory in the book Gottes Wege mit den Menschen. Ein gestaltpadagogisches Werkbuch and ends with the interpretations of the theory. This work focuses on the characteristics which explain the basic elements of the teaching-learning model and its process in details.  The rationale of this approach is gestalt education. Thus, the key concept of gestalt education and its three principles will be clarified. The former is to cultivate the learner’s life through the process of “form (as a concrete entity)-giving” and “ transformation” ; the latter is as follows: 1. the whole is more than the sum of parts, 2. viewing object with its background principle, 3. here and now principle.  The basic elements of the teaching-learning model are four: reading of Bible text, appreciating pictures as a unit of form, story-telling on the basis of Bible text, and creative work with the materials from the previous steps. The teaching-leaning process in details introduces the concrete ways for practical work. However, the whole process means not a linear pattern but a recursive pattern.  The integrated teaching-learning model based on gestalt education has a wholistic nature. Its working principle is to put together the polarised viewpoints which stand against each other, which present symbolic-theroretical, mythic-conceptual, imaginative-analytic, and informative-emotional aspects. Likewise, the principle has the organic nature. For this purpose, Hofer chooses a “methodological pluralism” . This means that all kinds of meaningful tools such as symbol didactics, theological hermeneutics, story-telling, arts, imagination through fantasy, and dialogical viewpoint with different academic areas can be used to contribute to one purpose.  In conclusion, this research deals with the implication and status of this model, situated among the landscape of religious teaching-learning methods.  The major contribution of this study is to maintain the wholistic and pluralistic approach in the teaching-learning process instead of one-sided approach, either tradition oriented or learner oriented, either intellectualistic or emotional. However, the individual ways and tools in the pluralistic approach need more rationale."
evolutionary anisotropy and flow stress in advanced high strength steels under loading path changes,2016,"['Finite element method', 'Steel', 'Sheet forming', 'Plasticity', 'Lankford coefficient', 'Anisotropic hardening']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Chaboche kinematic hardening, Yoshida-Uemori, and homogenous anisotropic hardening (HAH) models were evaluated in terms of their prediction capability of flow stress and evolutionary r-value under loading path changes. The first two models are based on kinematic hardening, whereas the HAH model is based on distortional hardening. Continuous compression-tension (CT) tests with pre-strains for dual phase 780 and transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) 780 steel sheets were conducted. For the initial anisotropy described by the Yld2000-2d model, uniaxial tension tests for three material orientations and a biaxial test were performed. During the CT tests, both stress and r-value variations with plastic strain were measured. All the models were implemented into the finite element software ABAQUS using user material subroutines. Experimentally, both sheets exhibited typical anisotropic hardening features such as the Bauschinger effect, transient hardening, and long-range softening. The TRIP 780 exhibited small work-hardening stagnation. In addition, the evolutionary r-value during the second loading was significant. The three models could predict most of the features in the stress-strain curves during the second loading. However, only the HAH model could predict the experimentally observed r-value evolution. This evolutionary r-value predicted by the HAH model could be explained by distortion of the yield locus during the first loading and its rapid recovery toward the initial yield locus shape.

A feedback type of the functional link artificial neural network (FFLANN) with recursive least square (RLS) training is proposed as a potential prediction model. Comparative performance measures obtained through simulation experiments of Principal component analysis (PCA) and Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based methods for two stock indices demonstrate that the proposed model is a better alternative for prediction of stock indices with respect to several performance measures. For comparison purposes multilayer artificial neural network (MLANN), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and support vector machine (SVM) based models are also simulated under similar conditions and it is observed that the proposed model is superior to MLANN, RBFNN and SVM based prediction models. Further, the involvement of low computational complexity and reduced training time of the model will be better suited for online prediction purpose."

To analyze this type of data, one may apply a regression model to log-transformed precipitation data after adding an arbitrarily chosen small positive value to the original data. In this paper, we first show limitations of the log-transformation method through a simulation study. Specifically, the sensitivity of regression coefficient estimate, its standard error and t-statistic to the choice of small positive value added to the original data is investigated. To overcome the limitations, we consider a compound Poisson regression model. Particularly, randomized quantile residuals are used in order to check the distribution assumption and examine the adequacy of the fitted regression model. The availability of the compound Poisson regression model is illustrated by analyzing a real precipitation data of Korean peninsula."

Numerical solutions for temperature, displacement and thermal stresses are obtained by using the method of Laplace transforms. Numerical results are plotted to illustrate the effect phase-lags, viscoelasticity, and the variability thermal conductivity parameter on the studied fields. The variations of all field quantities in the context of dual-phase-lags and coupled thermoelasticity models follow similar trends while the Lord and Shulman's model may be different. The influence of viscosity parameter and variability of thermal conductivity is very pronounced on temperature and thermal stresses of the thermoviscoelastic solids."

Batch sorption experiments were carried to evaluate the influence of pH, initial dye concentration, contact time, and temperature. The APSP was characterized by using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The experimental equilibrium adsorption data were fitted using two two-parameter models (Langmuir and Freundlich) and two three-parameter models (Sips and Toth). Langmuir and Sips isotherms provided the best model for MO adsorption data. The maximum monolayer sorption capacity was found to be 200.3 mg/g based on the Langmuir isotherm model. The pseudo-first-order and pseudo second -order model equations were used to analyze the kinetic data of the adsorption process and the data was fitted well with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model (R-2 > 0.97). The calculated thermodynamic parameters such as AG, AH and AS from experimental data showed that the sorption of MO onto APSP was feasible, spontaneous and endothermic in the temperature range 298-318 K. The FUR results revealed that amine and carboxyl functional groups present on the surface of APSP. The SEM results show that APSP has an irregular and porous surface which is adequate morphology for dye adsorption. Desorption experiments were carried to explore the feasibility of adsorbent regeneration and the adsorbed MO from APSP was desorbed using 0.1 M NaOH with an efficiency of 93.5%. Findings of the present study indicated that APSP can be successfully used for removal of MO from aqueous solution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</P>"

The removal efficiency was affected by the solution pH and showed a plateau formation decreasing on both sides of pH 4. The Cr(VI) uptake on Kanecaron SA fibers was rapidly increased in the first 10 min, and the kinetic data fit well to the Elovich model. Isotherm model analysis demonstrates that the Redlich-Peterson model suitably describes the equilibrium data, and the maximum adsorption capacity (Q(m)) from the Langmuir model was 87.366 mg/g for Cr(VI) in distilled water, 117.977 mg/g for total Cr, and 57.101 mg/g for Cr(VI) in wastewater. Additionally, the Cr(III) contained in the plating wastewater was removed by the Kanecaron SA fibers, while the other heavy metals were not removed. Thermodynamic analysis indicates that Cr(VI) adsorption to Kanecaron SA fibers decreased with increasing temperature from 10 to 50 degrees C, indicating the spontaneous and exothermic nature of the sorption process.

In order to make sure whether it has widely used as TM sensor, moreover, the aim of this work is to assess ADC-Lite performance such as its adaptability and practicability. In this paper, ADC-Lite multi-spectral data, ground truth ASD hyperspectral and Leaf area index (LAI) data were acquired in soybean planting area, Jiaxiang County, Shandong Province on September18th, 2015. Since the ADC-Lite has different spatial scales with TM, this paper used TM simulation data transformed by ground truth ASD data, constructed LAI inversion model by empirical model based on two sensors and ground measured data, using 5 vegetation indices: ratio vegetation index (RVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjust vegetation index (SAVI), difference vegetation index (DVI) and triangular vegetation index (TVI). Determination coefficient R2, root mean square error (RMSE) and the estimation accuracy (EA) 3 indicators were acquired to assess the model. This work suggests that the established model of ADC-Lite sensor with TM simulation sensor has high consistency in accuracy. NDVI linear regression model derived from both of them presented a strong correlation with ground-measured LAI. It’s preliminarily shown that ADC-Lite images assess soybean LAI is feasible. This is anticipated to have tremendous implications that ADC-Lite can be made supplement for existing satellites, aerial and ground sensing, provide important information for Crop condition monitoring and critical data to support crop maturity, nutrition monitoring and fertilization management."

It would not be wrong to say that the copyright fair use doctrine is the main reason of the rapid growth of Google. Google holds an unchallenging position in the field of web browsing service by ‘Google PageRank’ and ‘Google Books Libray Project’. ‘Google PageRank’ is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank websites in their search engine results. ‘Google PageRank’ is a way of measuring the importance of website pages. Also, ‘Google Books Libray Project’ is an effort by Google to scan and make searchable the collections of several major research libraries. Bibliographic information and parts of text from a book are often viewable. However, reproduction and display of intellectual properties are inevitable in the use of the page rank and the library project. Unless with the consent of the copyright holder, reproducing or distributing copies lead to infringement of copyright. Therefore, copyright owners which have their works posted on internet, book publishers, and writers argued copyright violation. In the lawsuit, Google counter-argued that reproduction and display of intellectual properties are legal based on fair use. In this paper, standard of judgment on fair use doctrine has been carefully reviewed and analyzed. On deciding the standard of judging fair use doctrine, the United States Court suggested the ‘transformative use doctrine’. The ‘transformative use doctrine’ broadened the use of intellectual properties. Companies like Google which provide internet services largely contributed on extending the business model. Recently, the fair use doctrine has been adopted to Korea from the United States in the process of FTA. There are no cases regarding the fair use doctrine in Korea yet, but it is a matter of grave concern whether the ‘transformative use doctrine’ will be used as the standard of ruling. Furthermore, the adoption of the doctrine may affect internet service companies in Korea to extend its business model like Google. It is worth watching how internet service providers in Korea may grow drastically as Google did with the use of the doctrine."

The link between CIRP and EMT, however, remains unknown. To determine the role of CIRP in EMT, we performed CIRP knockdown and overexpression experiments in in vitro TGF-β1-induced EMT models. We found that CIRP overexpression promoted the downregulation of epithelial markers and the upregulation of mesenchymal markers after TGF-β1 treatment for EMT induction. It also promoted cell migration and invasion, key features of EMT. In contrast, CIRP knockdown inhibited the downregulation of epithelial markers and the upregulation of mesenchymal markers after TGF-β1 treatment for EMT induction. In addition, it also inhibited cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the RNA-recognition motif in CIRP is essential for the role of CIRP in EMT. At the downstream level, CIRP knockdown downregulated Snail, key transcriptional regulator of EMT, while CIRP overexpression upregulated it. We found out that the link between CIRP and Snail is mediated by ERK and p38 pathways. EMT is a critical component of carcinoma metastasis and invasion. As demonstrated in this study, the biological role of CIRP in EMT may explain why CIRP overexpression has been associated with a bad prognosis in cancer patients."

local autoencoding for parameter estimation in a hidden potts-markov random field,2016,"['Potts model', 'Markov random field', 'Gibbs distribution', 'parameters estimation', 'local autoencoding']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>A local-autoencoding (LAE) method is proposed for the parameter estimation in a Hidden Potts-Markov random field model. Due to sampling cost, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are rarely used in real-time applications. Like other heuristic methods, LAE is based on a conditional independence assumption. It adapts, however, the parameters in a block-by-block style with a simple Hebbian learning rule. Experiments with given label fields show that the LAE is able to converge in far less time than required for a scan. It is also possible to derive an estimate for LAE based on a Cramer-Rao bound that is similar to the classical maximum pseudolikelihood method. As a general algorithm, LAE can be used to estimate the parameters in anisotropic label fields. Furthermore, LAE is not limited to the classical Potts model and can be applied to other types of Potts models by simple label field transformations and straightforward learning rule extensions. Experimental results on image segmentations demonstrate the efficiency and generality of the LAE algorithm.</P>"

Heart rate variability is a well-known measurement parameter to predict driver vigilance state, but the measurement is susceptible to motion artifact due to body movement where the electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor device had to be worn close to the heart. Thus, this paper presents a novel approach to measure the ECG from the driver palms while holding on the steering wheel. In addition, photoplethysmograms sensor attached on a driver finger can also measure the similar heart rate pattern, known as pulse rate variability. Another significant vigilance measurement parameter, respiratory rate variability, can be derived directly from the ECG with the squaring baseline method, without the usage of respiratory sensor. Furthermore, this paper is also focusing on the integration of age and gender as vigilance measurement parameter as each individual exhibits distinct signal pattern. Autonomous rules are derived from the data set that performs the kernel fuzzy c-means with if-then rules extraction, which subsequently classify the driver vigilance level into two predefined classes, that are drowsy and awake. The vigilance monitoring application is developed in smartwatch, able to perform the features extraction, and then predict the driver vigilance class based on the Kernel Fuzzy-C-Mean trained model. A vibration warning will be triggered to the driver if the driver is estimated as drowsy in five consecutive time frames. In fact, the experimental results stated that the prediction accuracy can be achieved at 97.28% on average across variant subjects.</P>"
multicracks identification in beams based on moving harmonic excitation,2016,"['multi-cracks identification', 'wavelet transform', 'differential quadrature method', 'moving harmonic excitation', 'free and forced vibration']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"A method of damage detection based on the moving harmonic excitation and continuous wavelet transforms is presented.

The continuous wavelet transforms, CWT, is used for cracks detection based on the resulting amplified signal. It is demonstrated that this identification procedure is largely better than the classical ones based on eigenfrequencies or on the eigenmodes wavelet transformed. For vibration responses, free and forced vibration analyses of multi-cracked beams are investigated based on both analytical and numerical methodological approaches. Cracks are modeled through rotational springs whose compliances are evaluated using linear elastic fracture mechanics. Based on the obtained forced responses, multi-cracks positions are accurately identified and the CWT identification can be highly improved by adjusting the frequency and the speed excitation parameters."

First the noise-containing signals are decomposed by discrete wavelet transform. The slope of the singular value spectrum for each layer is estimated. Then the wavelet entropy over the signal subinterval is calculated for each layer. Finally the optimal number of decomposition layer is determined by combining the entropy ratio of detail coefficients to original signal and the slope of the singular value spectrum. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the relative error of the peak value (REPV). Experiment shows that the algorithm can self-adaptively determine the optimal number of decomposition layers and filter out the noise contained in the ultrasonic signals. It not only increases the SNR, but also preserves valuable components of the original signal."

application of improved neural network algorithm in image denoising and edge detection,2016,"['image processing technology', 'image de-noising', 'image edge detection', 'BPNN']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The knowledge involved in digital image processing is very wide, and there are many kinds of methods. Traditional image processing technology is mainly focused on the acquisition, transformation, enhancement, restoration, compression encoding, segmentation, edge extraction and so on. With the emergence of new tools and new methods, the image processing technology has been updated and developed. In this paper, an effective method for edge detection and image de-noising is proposed. In this article, the impulse noise detector is composed of a BP neural network (BPNN) and a decision switch. BPNN requires four input values, which are the current pixel value, grey median value, energy value, and contrast. To take these four values as the input values, the impulse noise detector can show good performance. The output of the BPNN is transferred to the decision switch, and the output value is converted to 0 or 1, which is used to distinguish whether the pixels are polluted. At this point, we introduce an additional impulse term and establish the improved BPNN model. The additional impulse term can effectively speed up the convergence of the network, avoid the emergence of the local minimum problem, and ensure the stability of the training process. In this way, the IBPNN filter of this paper only uses the information of the non polluted pixels to filter the noise pixels, which avoids the secondary pollution, and obtains a better performance. This algorithm has high PSNR value and strong detail information and edge preserving ability. Finally, the improved BPNN algorithm is applied to the image edge detection, and we use the improved neural network model to detect the edge of the image. Because the method can be used to include the prior knowledge, the IBPNN method is better than the traditional method in image edge detection."

micromechanical finite element analysis of strain partitioning in multiphase medium manganese twip+trip steel,2016,"['Medium Mn steel', 'Strain partitioning', 'TWIP+TRIP', 'Finite element methods']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>In the present contribution, a phenomenological constitutive model of medium manganese steels, in which both twinning-induced (TWIP) and transformation-induced (TRIP) plasticity enhancing mechanisms are activated, is implemented in the finite element framework. The implementation is utilized for the analysis of the full-field strain partitioning in dual-phase microstructure maps obtained from electron backscattering diffraction. The results of the finite element analysis suggest that the strain localization in the studied steel has an alternating character. Specifically, in the low strain region, most of the externally imposed deformation is accommodated by the initially softer austenite. The higher strain hardening rate of austenite due to deformation twinning (TWIP effect) and the mechanically-induced transformation to martensite (TRIP effect) results in a shift of the strain localization to ferrite. This alternating strain localization is a key feature that distinguishes the medium manganese TWIP+TRIP steel. It is shown that this alternating strain localization contributes to the superior mechanical behavior of medium manganese TWIP+TRIP steel reported in the literature. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

energy-efficient power control for underlaying d2d communication with channel uncertainty: user-centric versus network-centric,2016,"['Channel uncertainty', 'device-to-device (D2D) communication', 'energy efficiency (EE)', 'network-centric', 'Stackelberg game', 'user-centric']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Most existing resource management problem models arise from the original desire of allocating resources in either a user-centric or network-centric manner. The difference between their objectives is obvious: user-centric methods attempt to optimize the utility of individual users, whereas network-centric models intend to optimize the collective utilities of the entire network. In this paper, from the above two aspects, we analyze the robust power control problem in device-to-device (D2D) communication underlaying cellular networks, where two types of channel uncertainty set (e.g., ellipsoidal and column-wise) are considered. In the user-centric method, we formulate the problem into the form of a Stackelberg game, where the energy efficiency (EE) of each user is the ingredient of utility function. In order to protect the cellular user equipment's (CUE) uplink transmission, we introduce a price based cost function into the objectives of D2D user equipment (DUE). The existence and uniqueness of the game with the influence of channel uncertainty and price are discussed. In the network-centric method, we aim to maximize the collective EE of CUEs and DUEs. We show that by the appropriate mathematical transformation, the network-centric D2D power control problem has the identical local solution to that of a special case of the user-centric problem, where price plays a key role. Numerical results show the performance of the robust power control algorithms in the user-centric and network-centric models."

Although the stacking fault energy, calculated using a modified thermodynamic model, slightly decreased with increasing grain size, it was found to vary in a range of $23.4mJ/m^2$ to $27.1mJ/m^2$. Room-temperature tensile test results indicated that the yield and tensile strengths increased; the ductility also improved as the grain size decreased. The increase in the yield and tensile strengths was primarily attributed to the occurrence of mechanical twinning, as well as to the grain refinement effect. On the other hand, the improvement of the ductility is because the formation of deformation-induced martensite is suppressed in the high-manganese steel specimen with small grain size during tensile testing. The deformation-induced martensite transformation resulting from the increased grain size can be explained by the decrease in stacking fault energy or in shear stress required to generate deformation-induced martensite transformation."

The algorithm was developed through the integration of the fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm, statistics formulation, short-time Fourier transforms, high frequency radar data processing and window function analysis. This method provides new insight into the detection of ocean wave characteristics and provides a more direct and convenient way to detect changes in ocean wave characteristics than the conventional method. To demonstrate the proposed algorithm, two Wellen radar systems were installed in Samcheok City, Gangwon-do on the East Coast of South Korea. A data set was selected for training the proposed algorithm while three other data sets, not used for the training processes, were used to validate the proposed model. The testing results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective in extracting characteristic features from a variety of ocean waves. It is expected that the proposed system will accurately predict natural hazards and provide adequate warning time for people to evacuate from threatened coastal area.

impacts of air-sea exchange coefficients on snowfall events over the korean peninsula,2016,"['Air-sea exchange coefficient', 'Snowfall', 'WRF']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Snowfall over the Korean Peninsula is mainly associated with air mass transformation by the fluxes across the air-sea interface during cold-air outbreaks over the warm Yellow Sea. The heat and momentum exchange coefficients in the surface flux parameterization are key parameters of flux calculations across the air-sea interface. This study investigates the effects of the air-sea exchange coefficients on the simulations of snowfall events over the Korean Peninsula using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Two snowfall cases are selected for this study. One is a heavy snowfall event that took place on January 4, 2010, and the other is a light snowfall event that occurred on December 2324, 2011. Several sensitivity tests are carried out with increased and decreased heat and momentum exchange coefficients. The domain-averaged precipitation is increased (decreased) with increased (decreased) heat exchange coefficient because the increased (decreased) surface heat flux leads to more (less) moist conditions in the low level of the atmosphere. On the other hand, the domain-averaged precipitation is decreased (increased) with increased (decreased) momentum exchange coefficient because the increased (decreased) momentum coefficient causes reduction (increase) of wind speed and heat flux. The variation of precipitation in the heat exchange coefficient experiments is much larger than that in the momentum exchange coefficient experiments because the change of heat flux has a more direct impact on moisture flux and snowfall amount, while the change of momentum flux has a rather indirect impact via wind speed changes. The low-pressure system is intensified and moves toward North when the heat exchange coefficient is increased because warming and moistening of the lower atmosphere contributes to destabilize the air mass, resulting in the change of precipitation pattern over the Korean Peninsula in the heat exchange coefficient experiments.

gyrator-based analysis of resonant circuits in inductive power transfer systems,2016,"['unity power factor', 'Compensation circuit', 'gyrator', 'inductive power transfer system (IPTS)', 'transformer']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>In this paper, first, it is found that not only the magnetically coupled inductors but also all inductive power transfer systems (IPTSs) inherently have the nature of a gyrator. Widely known characteristics of IPTSs such as impedance inversion and source-type conversion are proved to be the nature of the gyrator. A graphical approach that utilizes the gyrator is proposed for the modeling of IPTSs in general. The proposed graphical technique enables manipulations on the circuit diagram instead of on the circuit equations, which are difficult to handle when the system order is higher than 4. Hence, the equivalent model can be obtained almost by inspection conveniently, giving fruitful physical insights that are limitedly achieved with the equation manipulations. Steady-state analyses at any frequency are possible, and equivalent series resistances can also be included in the proposed model. Five selected electrical characteristics, i.e., source-to-load gain, load-independent output voltage/current characteristics, power factor at the source, sign of the source phase angle, and allowances of open/short loads are evaluated for three widely used IPTS topologies. Also, this technique is extended to the mistuned case for verifying the general use of the approach. An experimental prototype of the voltage-source-type inductor-capacitor-inductor secondary-parallel (V-LCL-P) topology was built to demonstrate the proposed approach for both perfectly tuned and mistuned situations at 85 W and 100 kHz.</P>"

The most solutions fail in long-term reliability and/or use too generalized linearization models. This is why in this paper we have examined some high dynamic manoeuvres which are usually a part of automotive tests. Some major issues during these manoeuvres were identified and a modified Kalman filter solution is presented. The problem of positioning of an inertial device within a vehicle is addressed and a transformation of measured data to the centre of gravity (COG) or rotation point (RP) of the vehicle is introduced. We also propose a few methods to identify the start and the stop of a brake test and show distance difference between conventional and modified Kalman algorithm during driving in circles. Finally, a direct and indirect lever-arm correction is introduced and real road tests are made to present an improvement in outputs using one-device sensor setup."

This study evaluated natural attenuation processes of TCE at an industrial site in Korea by delineating hydrogeochemical characteristics along the flow path of contaminated groundwater, by calculating reaction rate constants for TCE and its degradation products, and by using geochemical and reactive transport modeling. The monitoring data showed that TCE tended to be transformed to cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cis-1,2-DCE) and further to vinyl chloride (VC) via microbial reductive dechlorination, although the degree was not too significant. According to our modeling results, the temporal and spatial distribution of the TCE plume suggested the dominant role of biodegradation in attenuation processes. This study can provide a useful method for assessing natural attenuation processes in the aquifer contaminated with chlorinated hydrocarbons and can be applied to other sites with similar hydrological, microbiological, and geochemical settings."

These phenomena are dominated by the evolution of microstructures. In recent years, the microstructures in SMAs have been studied extensively and modeled using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, it remains difficult to identify the crystal variants in the simulation results, which consist of large numbers of atoms. In the present work, a method is developed to identify the austenite phase and the monoclinic martensite crystal variants in MD results. The transformation matrix of each lattice is calculated to determine the corresponding crystal variant. Evolution of the volume fraction of the crystal variants and the microstructure in Ni-Ti SMAs under thermal and mechanical boundary conditions are examined. The method is validated by comparing MD-simulated interface normals with theoretical solutions. In addition, the results show that, in certain cases, the interatomic potential used in the current study leads to inconsistent monoclinic lattices compared with crystallographic theory. Thus, a specific modification is applied and the applicability of the potential is discussed."

It detects moving objects not only sharply by a pixel-based modeling algorithm, but also robustly against dynamic background by a region-based modeling algorithm. However, it uses a quantized pixel value to reduce computational complexity. For this reason, it is hard to apply the gradient feature (e.g., local binary pattern(LBP) and histogram of oriented gradient(HOG)) which is robust against the light change environment. To solve this problem, we propose an algorithm that detects the moving objects using gradient vector-based MKFC. However, performance of moving object detection can be degraded by the noise resulting from gradient vector-based image transform. In this paper, we propose an improved moving objects detection algorithm using gradient based MKFC. The algorithm uses a median filter for denoising the image from gradient vector-based image transform and determines the candidate region based on similarity estimate. Finally, the approach detects the moving objects by applying a Gaussian filter to the candidate region. Simulation results in a light changing environment show that the proposed algorithm yields better moving-object detecting performance than the conventional algorithm."

We investigated whether metformin has an inhibitory effect on bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis in a murine model. A total of 62 mice were divided into 5 groups: control, metformin (100 mg/ kg), BLM, and BLM with metformin (50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg). Metformin was administered to the mice orally once a day from day 1. We sacrificed half of the mice on day 10 and collected the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from their left lungs. The remaining mice were sacrificed and analyzed on day 21. The right lungs were harvested for histological analyses. The messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers were determined via analysis of the harvested lungs on day 21. The mice treated with BLM and metformin (50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg) showed significantly lower levels of inflammatory cells in the BALF compared with the BLM-only mice on days 10 and 21. The histological examination revealed that the metformin treatment led to a greater reduction in inflammation than the treatment with BLM alone. The mRNA levels of collagen, collagen-1, procollagen, fibronectin, and transforming growth factor-β in the metformin-treated mice were lower than those in the BLM-only mice on day 21, although statistical significance was observed only in the case of procollagen due to the small number of live mice in the BLM-only group. Additionally, treatment with metformin reduced fibrosis to a greater extent than treatment with BLM alone. Metformin suppresses the inflammatory and fibrotic processes of BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis in a murine model."

The finite element software, ANSYS, was used to model and predict the temperature distribution in the test sample under an imposed heat flux on the exterior of the TBC. The phase image was computed with the use of the software MATLAB and Thermofit Pro using a Fourier transform. The relationship between the coating thickness and the corresponding phase angle was then established with the coating thickness being expressed as a function of the phase angle. The method is successfully applied to measure the coating thickness that varied from 0.25 mm to 1.5 mm."

Previously, we investigated the differentiation of rat dermal fibroblasts to α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)-positive myofibroblasts through transforming growth factor (TGF)-β production using a 3D culture model. Here, we investigated the phenotypic change from dermal mesenchymal cells (mostly fibroblasts) to osteoblast-like cells, being inspired by the roles of smooth muscle cells or fibroblasts during vascular calcification. Spindle-shaped cells that grew in heterologous populations out of dermal explants from 2-day-old Wistar rats were cultured within a collagen matrix. α-SMA and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) messenger RNA (mRNA) levels initially increased, followed by a rise in Runx2 and osteocalcin (OCN) mRNA levels without calcification. Calcium deposits were produced in the presence of a high concentration of inorganic phosphate (2.1 mM) or β-glycerophosphate (βGP, 10 mM) after 2 weeks of culture, and both were sensitive to an inhibitor of type III phosphate transporters. An ALP inhibitor decreased only βGP-induced calcification. Inhibition of TGF-β type-I receptors attenuated ALP mRNA levels and βGP-induced calcification, suggesting that endogenous TGF-β stimulates ALP activity and then βGP breakdown. An increase in the number of cells embedded in the collagen gel enhanced the mRNA levels of Runx2 and OCN, but not of ALP. Collectively, several factors are likely to promote the differentiation of dermal mesenchymal cells into osteoblast-like cells and ectopic calcification in a 3D collagen matrix, implying the utility of these cells as a potential autologous cell source for tissue engineering."

Simvastatin was effective at reducing fibrosis in various models. Peri-implant capsular formation is the result of tissue fibrosis development in irradiated breasts. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of simvastatin on peri-implant fibrosis in rats. Eighteen male Sprague- Dawley rats were allocated to an experimental group (9 rats, 18 implants) or a control group (9 rats, 18 implants). Two hemispherical silicone implants, 10 mm in diameter, were inserted in subpanniculus pockets in each rat. The next day, 10-Gy of radiation from a clinical accelerator was targeted at the implants. Simvastatin (15 mg/kg/day) was administered by oral gavage in the experimental group, while animals in the control group received water. At 12 weeks post-implantation, peri-implant capsules were harvested and examined histologically and by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The average capsular thickness was 371.2 μm in the simvastatin group and 491.2 μm in the control group. The fibrosis ratio was significantly different, with 32.33% in the simvastatin group and 58.44% in the control group (P < 0.001). Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 gene expression decreased significantly in the simvastatin group compared to the control group (P < 0.001). This study shows that simvastatin reduces radiation-induced capsular fibrosis around silicone implants in rats.

The sorbent was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, vibrating sample magnetometer, N2 sorption analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The removal efficiency of the sorbent for Cr(VI) was also investigated. Chromium adsorption was fitted by the pseudo-second-order and Langmuir models. The maximum chromium adsorption capacity, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area, and average Barrett-Joyner-Halenda pore size of the magnetic sorbent were 157.7mg·g−1, 134.1m2·g−1, and 4.99 nm, respectively. The saturated magnetization of the novel adsorbent was 77.8 emu·g−1, indicating that the material can facilitate separation and recovery from aqueous systems.The removal mechanisms of Cr(VI) were also discussed. The result illustrates that rice husk-derived magnetic carbonaceous materials are a potential adsorbent for Cr(VI) pollution treatment and provide a suitable method for the effective conversion of biomass waste, which may solve the problem of waste disposal and widen the applications of the materials."

fast prediction mode decision in hevc using a pseudo rate-distortion based on separated encoding structure,2016,"['HEVC', 'Video encoding', 'pseudo', 'rate-distortion.']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"A novel fast algorithm is suggested for a coding unit (CU) mode decision using pseudo rate-distortion based on a separated encoding structure in High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). A conventional HEVC encoder requires a large computational time for a CU mode prediction because prediction and transformation procedures are applied to obtain a rate-distortion cost. Hence, for the practical application of HEVC encoding, it is necessary to significantly reduce the computational time of CU mode prediction. As described in this paper, under the proposed separated encoder structure, it is possible to decide the CU prediction mode without a full processing of the prediction and transformation to obtain a rate-distortion cost based on a suitable condition. Furthermore, to construct a suitable condition to improve the encoding speed, we employ a pseudo rate-distortion estimation based on a Hadamard transformation and a simple quantization. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a 38.68% reduction in the total encoding time with a similar coding performance to that of the HEVC reference model."

net analyte signal-based quantitative determination of fusel oil in korean alcoholic beverage using ft-nir spectroscopy,2016,"['Alcoholic beverages', 'FT-NIR spectroscopy', 'Fusel oil', 'Multivariate calibration', 'Net analyte signal', 'Wavelength selection']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Fusel oil is a potent volatile aroma compound found in many alcoholic beverages. At low concentrations, it makes an essential contribution to the flavor and aroma of fermented alcoholic beverages, while at high concentrations, it induced an off-flavor and is thought to cause undesirable side effects. In this work, we introduce Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy as a rapid and nondestructive technique for the quantitative determination of fusel oil in the Korean alcoholic beverage soju. Methods: FT-NIR transmittance spectra in the 1000-2500 nm region were collected for 120 soju samples with fusel oil concentrations ranging from 0 to 1400 ppm. The calibration and validation data sets were designed using data from 75 and 45 samples, respectively. The net analyte signal (NAS) was used as a preprocessing method before the application of the partial least-square regression (PLSR) and principal component regression (PCR) methods for predicting fusel oil concentration. A novel variable selection method was adopted to determine the most informative spectral variables to minimize the effect of nonmodeled interferences. Finally, the efficiency of the developed technique was evaluated with two different validation sets. Results: The results revealed that the NAS-PLSR model with selected variables (R²<sub>v</sub> = 0.95, RMSEV = 100ppm) did not outperform the NAS-PCR model (R²<sub>v</sub>= 0.97, RMSEV = 7 8.9ppm). In addition, the NAS-PCR shows a better recovery for validation set 2 and a lower relative error for validation set 3 than the NAS-PLSR model. Conclusion: The experimental results indicate that the proposed technique could be an alternative to conventional methods for the quantitative determination of fusel oil in alcoholic beverages and has the potential for use in in-line process control."

To target human metastatic breast cancer as well as improving patient compliance, we developed an orally active low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)-taurocholate conjugated with tetrameric deoxycholic acid, namely LHTD4, which followed by physical complexation with a synthetic bile acid enhancer, DCK. In breast cancer, both transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and CXCL12 exhibit enhanced metastatic activity during the initiation and progression stages of breast cancer, thus we direct the focus on investigating the antimetastatic effect of LHTD4/DCK complex by targeting TGF-beta 1 and CXCL12. Computer simulation study and SPR analysis were performed for the binding confirmation of LHTD4 with TGF-beta 1 and CXCL12. We carried out in vitro phosphorylation assays of the consecutive receptors of TGF-beta 1 and CXCL12 (TGF-beta 1R1 and CXCR4, respectively). Effects of LHTD4 on in vitro cell migration (induced by TGF-beta 1) and chemotaxis (mediated by CXCL12) were investigated. The in vivo anti-metastatic effect of LHTD4 was evaluated in an accelerated metastasis model and an orthotopic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer model. The obtained K-D values of TGF-beta 1 and CXCL12 with LHTD4 were 0.85 and 0.019 mu M respectively. The simulation study showed that binding affinities of LHTD4 fragment with either TGF-beta 1 or CXCL12 through additional electrostatic interaction was more stable than that of LMWH fragment. In vitro phosphorylation assays of TGF-beta 1 and CXCR4 showed that the effective inhibition of receptor phosphorylation was observed with the treatment of LHTD4. The expressions of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker proteins such as vimentin and Snail were prevented by LTHD4 treatment in in vitro studies with TGF-beta 1 treated MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, we observed that LHTD4 negatively regulated the functions of TGF-beta 1 and CXCL12 on migration and invasion of breast cancer cell. In several advanced orthotopic and experimental breast cancer metastasis murine models, the treatment with LHTD4 (5 mg/kg daily, p.o.) significantly inhibited metastasis compared to the control. Overall, LHTD4 exhibited anti-metastatic effects by inhibiting TGF-beta 1 and CXCL12, and the clinically relevant dose of orally active LHTD4 was found to be effective in preclinical studies without any apparent toxicity.

NecroX compounds have been shown to protect the liver and heart from ischemia-reperfusion injury. The aim of this study was to further define the role and mechanism of action of NecroX-5 in regulating inflammation and fibrosis responses in a model of hypoxia/reoxygenation (HR). We utilized HR-treated rat hearts and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated H9C2 culture cells in the presence or absence of NecroX-5 ($10{\mu}mol/L$) treatment as experimental models. Addition of NecroX-5 significantly increased decorin (Dcn) expression levels in HR-treated hearts. In contrast, expression of transforming growth factor beta 1 ($TGF{\beta}1$) and Smad2 phosphorylation (pSmad2) was strongly attenuated in NecroX-5-treated hearts. In addition, significantly increased production of tumor necrosis factor alpha ($TNF{\alpha}$), $TGF{\beta}1$, and pSmad2, and markedly decreased Dcn expression levels, were observed in LPS-stimulated H9C2 cells. Interestingly, NecroX-5 supplementation effectively attenuated the increased expression levels of $TNF{\alpha}$, $TGF{\beta}1$, and pSmad2, as well as the decreased expression of Dcn. Thus, our data demonstrate potential antiinflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects of NecroX-5 against cardiac HR injuries via modulation of the $TNF{\alpha}/Dcn/TGF{\beta}1/Smad2$ pathway."

It is then extended to include the revenue for providing vehicle-to-grid frequency regulation. In order to take advantages of high performance existing solvers, several mathematical techniques are applied to transform the discrete non-linear cost function to a differentiable continuous function. In the latter part of the paper, simulations are performed to verify and show the performance of the developed model.

A reduced linear system reproducing GR instability is used. It is obtained using successively Coleman transformation and binormal transformation. The analysis of the steadystate responses of this model is performed when a NES is attached on the helicopter fuselage. The NES involves an essential cubic restoring force and a linear damping force. The analysis is achieved applying complexification-averaging method. The resulting slow-flow model is finally analyzed using multiple scale approach. Four steady-state responses corresponding to complete suppression, partial suppression through strongly modulated response, partial suppression through periodic response and no suppression of the GR are highlighted. An algorithm based on simple criterions is developed to predict these steady-state response regimes. Numerical simulations of the complete system confirm this analysis of the slow-flow dynamics. A parametric analysis of the influence of the NES damping coefficient and the rotor speed on the response regime is finally proposed."

Those scaffolds were then conjugated with heparin via EDC chemistry and subsequently immobilized with transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1. The amount of TGF-beta 1 was quantitatively measured and the release profile showed a continuous release of TGF-beta 1 for 4 weeks. Human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UCB-MSCs) were seeded in four different scaffolds; control, fibronectin (FN)-coated, hFDM-coated, hFDM/TGF-beta 1 and subjected to chondrogenic differentiation in vitro for up to 28 days. Both hFDM and hFDM/TGF-beta 1 groups exhibited significantly more synthesis of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and much better upregulation of chondrogenic markers expression. Interestingly, MSCs condensation that led to cell aggregates was clearly observed with time in the two hFDM-coated groups and the quantitative difference was obvious compared to the control and FN group. A mechanistic study in gene and protein level indicated that focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was involved at the early stage of cell adhesion and cell cell contact-related markers, N-cadherin and neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), were highly up-regulated at later time point. In addition histological analysis proved that hFDM/TGF-beta 1 group was the most effective in forming neocartilage tissue in a rabbit articular cartilage defect model. Taken together, this study demonstrates not only the positive effect of hFDM on chondrogenesis of MSCs and cartilage repair but also provides an important insight toward the significance of in vitro mesenchymal condensation on chondrogenic development of MSCs.

hybrid materials in the remediation of arsenic contaminated waters: a physico-chemical study,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Hybrid materials are obtained by the organic modification of sericite using the organic cations viz. tetramethylammonium chloride (TMA or T) and dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride as (DDDMA or D) by a simple wet cation exchange process. Surface morphology of these solids is discussed with the Scanning Electron Microscopic images. Moreover, the materials are characterized by the X-ray diffraction and Fourier Transform-Infrared analytical techniques. Removal behavior of these organo-modified sericite samples is assessed for arsenite and arsenate from aqueous solutions under the batch and column reactor operations. The batch reactor experiments show that increasing the sorptive concentration (1-20mg/L) and pH (2-10) is caused to decrease the percent uptake of arsenite and arsenate significantly. Increasing the background electrolyte concentrations from 0.0001 to 0.1mol/L NaNO3 causes a significant decrease in percent removal of As(III) which infers that As(III) is sorbed onto the solid surface, primarily, by weak electrostatic or by van der Waals forces hence, forming an outer-sphere complexes at the solid surface. On the other hand As(V) uptake is insignificantly affected in presence of background electrolyte concentrations. This indicates that As(V) is sorbed by a strong chemical force and forming an inner sphere complexes onto the solid surface. The equilibrium state modeling shows that the data is fitted well to the Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption isotherms. The sorption capacities of these solids are calculated under these equilibrium conditions which indicate that organo-modified-sericite samples possess significantly higher removal capacity comparing to the virgin sericite. The leaching of the organic molecules (T or D) are also conducted in the sorption process of As(III) or As(V) and shows that almost negligible amount of T or D leaches in the bulk solutions since the Total Organic Carbon value of the bulk solution is not increased. Further, the breakthrough curves are obtained for these oxyanions under the column experimentations and the data is fitted well to the Thomas equation hence, the maximum loading capacity for arsenic is estimated under the dynamic conditions.</P>"

The results indicate that high concentration pollutant could be removed effectively by Fe/Cu bimetallic system at a high operating temperature. And the removal efficiencies of AO7 by Fe/Cu bimetallic system were in accordance with the pseudofirst- order model. Finally, it was observed that the high temperature could accelerate mass transport rate and overcome the high activation energy barrier to significantly improve the reactivity of Fe/Cu bimetallic particles. Therefore, the higher removal efficiency could be obtained by Fe/Cu system at a high operating temperature.

support vector machine based fault detection approach for rft-30 cyclotron,2016,"['Cyclotron', 'Fault detection', 'Support vector machine', 'Principal component analysis']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"An RFT-30 is a 30MeV cyclotron used for radioisotope applications and radiopharmaceutical researches. The RFT-30 cyclotron is highly complex and includes many signals for control and monitoring of the system. It is quite difficult to detect and monitor the system failure in real time. Moreover, continuous monitoring of the system is hard and time-consuming work for human operators. In this paper, we propose a support vector machine (SVM) based fault detection approach for the RFT-30 cyclotron. The proposed approach performs SVM learning with training samples to construct the classification model. To compensate the system complexity due to the large-scale accelerator, we utilize the principal component analysis (PCA) for transformation of the original data. After training procedure, the proposed approach detects the system faults in real time. We analyzed the performance of the proposed approach utilizing the experimental data of the RFT-30 cyclotron. The performance results show that the proposed SVM approach can provide an efficient way to control the cyclotron system."

coastal ocean and shelf-sea biogeochemical cycling of trace elements and isotopes: lessons learned from geotraces,2016,"['GEOTRACES', 'trace elements', 'isotopes', 'radium', 'continental shelf']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Continental shelves and shelf seas play a central role in the global carbon cycle. However, their importance with respect to trace element and isotope (TEI) inputs to ocean basins is less well understood. Here, we present major findings on shelf TEI biogeochemistry from the GEOTRACES programme as well as a proof of concept for a new method to estimate shelf TEI fluxes. The case studies focus on advances in our understanding of TEI cycling in the Arctic, transformations within a major river estuary (Amazon), shelf sediment micronutrient fluxes and basin-scale estimates of submarine groundwater discharge. The proposed shelf flux tracer is 228-radium (<I>T</I><SUB>1/2</SUB> = 5.75 yr), which is continuously supplied to the shelf from coastal aquifers, sediment porewater exchange and rivers. Model-derived shelf <SUP>228</SUP>Ra fluxes are combined with TEI/ <SUP>228</SUP>Ra ratios to quantify ocean TEI fluxes from the western North Atlantic margin. The results from this new approach agree well with previous estimates for shelf Co, Fe, Mn and Zn inputs and exceed published estimates of atmospheric deposition by factors of approximately 3–23. Lastly, recommendations are made for additional GEOTRACES process studies and coastal margin-focused section cruises that will help refine the model and provide better insight on the mechanisms driving shelf-derived TEI fluxes to the ocean.</P><P>This article is part of the themed issue ‘Biological and climatic impacts of ocean trace element chemistry’.</P>"

One of the most prominent painters who made a constant effort to defend and revitalise Chinese painting amid Western domination in the early and mid-twentieth century, he was deeply concerned with the issue of how to explore a new creative territory within the Chinese ink and brush tradition. Fu Baoshi was born in the last years of the Qing dynasty(1644-1912) when China was going through unprecedented turmoil and transformation. Despite his humble background, his diverse experiences from an early age, including his frequent visits to the mounting and seal carving shops, his education at the newly established modern school, his teaching experiences, his identity as an artist and his overseas study with the help of Xu Beihong(1895-1953), all combined to play a significant role in his individual artistic pursuit as well as his responsibility as an artist representing his country.  This paper focuses on Fu Baoshi’s studies in Japan from 1932 to 1935 and explores the role this experience played as a catalyst for him to rethink the nature of Chinese art and its tradition, providing him with an opportunity to enlarge his artistic horizons. On 5th September 1932, Fu Baoshi went to Japan under a Chinese government scholarship to carry out research into Japanese arts and crafts with the aim of helping to improve the Jingdezhen ceramic industry. During his first year in Tokyo, his observation of Japan’s promotion of arts and crafts and protection of the country’s artistic heritage motivated him to urge the Chinese government to learn from Japan. By visiting art schools, galleries and museums, Fu Baoshi learnt about the Japanese government’s systemic institutionalisation of art and its promotion of art exhibitions and art associations, in particular the significance of national treasures and the importance of preserving them, at the same time increasing his sense of national mission as an artist.  During his second year as a post-graduate student at the Imperial School of Fine Arts in Tokyo(Teikoku bijutsu gakkō, 帝国美術学校; today Musashino Art University), Fu Baoshi concentrated on training in the history of art under the supervision of his Japanese professor Kinbara Seigo(金原省吾, 1888-1958). As such, this paper also investigates how Fu Baoshi engaged with art historical research on Chinese art through the lens of Japanese scholarship and rediscovered and reinterpreted the Chinese art tradition by analysing his own writings and other related Japanese articles. He developed his knowledge on Chinese painting through the Japanese scholarship, particularly on the Eastern Jin painter Gu Kaizhi, Tang and Song painting, and the later Ming painter Shitao, thus broadening his perspective on Chinese painting traditions as well as exerting an impact on his own individual style of painting which he was able to establish in the 1940s.  First, inspired by Kinbara Seigo’s studies, Fu Baoshi started researching the history of ‘lines; in Chinese painting and developed his scholarly interest in Gu Kaizhi. Taking Gu Kaizhi’s Admonitions Scroll as a technical model, he later established his personal style of figure painting depicting female figures. Second, having studied Tang and Song painting through his Japanese professor, he tried to analyse Chinese painting history from the perspective of the painting substance such as ‘line’, ‘colour’ and ‘ink’ as well as technique, with emphasis on the use of brushwork and ink. As well as realising the importance of the works by Chan monks of the Southern Song in terms of Chinese painting history, he was attracted to the monks’ dramatic treatment of ink and their experimentation with ink tonality which became sources of inspiration for his landscape paintings after he returned from Japan. Third, inspired by the Japanese scholarship on Shitao"
asset specificity and capability of e-trade performance: evidence from korea,2016,"['Performance', 'Dynamic capability', 'E-Trade', 'Exporting firms', 'Asset specificity']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Purpose – E-Trade (paperless trade or cross-border e-commerce in B2B format) does not necessarily show positive results. The purpose of this paper is to conceptualize why and how such happens and furthermore, has two research purposes. First is to explain why studies in e-Trade performance show controversial results, such as some showing positive while others are not. Second is to investigate the relationship among research constructs such as e-Trade benefits, e-Trade use, asset specificity, and exporting firm’s capability.Design/methodology/approach – This study considers multiple dimensions and evolutionary perspective of e-Trade performance. Structural equation model adopts the measures of firm’s capability, e-Trade use, and benefits to analyze e-Trade performance. Performance was divided into organizational net benefits (ONB) and industrial net benefits. Several hypotheses were suggested to test the relationship among the variables in the model. Basic moderator effect represented as an interaction between asset specificity and other constructs. In total, 295 exporting firms have participated in the survey and their responses were utilized for analysis.Findings – This study shows that e-Trade performance should consider maturity as well as multiple stages among constructs. Critical paths were found among capability factors, process use (PU), ONB, and asset specificity. Results also show that information capability and marketing capability (MC) are determinant factors on e-Trade performance. In addition, MC and level of PU are read to be determinant factors of ONB. Furthermore, small and medium-sized enterprises’ (SMEs’) asset specificity, with level of capability and e-Trade use moderates their e-Trade performance.Research limitations/implications – Asset specificity of SMEs has to be managed in a positive direction. Government’s e-Trade supporting programs for SMEs should be transformed in a way that can foster the growth of capability and self-sustainment. It reads to be inevitable to amend the current characteristics of e-Trade services. Furthermore, developing a specialized e-Trade service for large firms will also be in need. And utilizing exporting firm’s financial data would be more advisable testing the hypotheses.Originality/value – Most works in information system as well as in e-Trade area report controversial performance results and this paper suggests an alternative model by combining asset specificity into capability and e-Trade use. Study on e-Trade performance is complicated and needs to consider multiple dimensions as well as their stages. This study envisions firm’s capability, asset specificity and at the same time contributes in e-Trade benefits."

We investigated the effects of TCMG-100 extract on erectile function using in vitro and in vivo studies. Methods: To examine the relaxation effects and mechanisms of action of TCMG-100 on rabbit cavernosal strips evaluated in an organ bath. To investigate the long-term treatment effect of TCMG-100, 8-wk administration was performed. After administration of TCMG-100, intracavernosal pressure, cyclic guanosine monophosphate and nitric oxide (NO) levels of cavernosal tissue, serum testosterone level, histological observation of collagen fiber, endothelium, smooth muscle cell, and transforming growth factor-${\beta}1$ were investigated. Results: TCMG-100 extract displayed dose-dependent relaxation effects on precontracted rabbit corporal smooth muscle. The TCMG-100-induced relaxation was significantly reduced by removing the endothelium, and treatment with an NO synthase inhibitor or NO scavenger. Eight weeks of TCMG-100 administration increased intracavernosal pressure in a rat model. The levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate and NO in the corpus callosum and serum testosterone level were also increased by TCMG-100 treatment. Furthermore, histological evaluation of collagen, smooth muscle, and endothelium showed increases in endothelium and smooth muscle, and a decrease in transforming growth factor-${\beta}1$ expression. Conclusion: These relaxation effects on corporal smooth muscle and increased erectile function suggest that TCMG-100 might be used as an alternative herbal medicine to improve erectile function."

The swelling study of the PAPDM hydrogels were performed in the aqueous environment to calculate the morphological parameters, such as the volume fraction in a swollen gel (v2m), polymer-solvent interaction parameter (χ) and molecular weight between the crosslinks (Mc). These hydrogels were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and scanning electron microscopy. Further these chelating hydrogels were investigated for the removal of rare earth metal ions (samarium and terbium) from aqueous environments by varying the adsorption time, adsorbate concentration and monomer ratio. The adsorption time data for samarium and terbium were fitted to two simple kinetic models, pseudo-first and pseudo-second-order, and tested to examine the adsorption mechanisms. The kinetic parameters were calculated. The equilibrium data was fitted well to the Langmuir and Freundlich models."

agritourism a challenge for the romanian tourism,2016,"['Competitiveness', 'Competitive Advantage', 'Porter`s Diamond', 'Agritourism', 'Factors', 'Potential Benefits']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The constantly growing number of travel destinations and the enhanced quality of existing ones put great pressure on those responsible for a given destination to find better ways to compete in the tourism marketplace and to do so in a sustainable manner. Consequently, a necessary first step in achieving this goal would be to better understand those forces and success factors that determine the competitiveness of major tourism destinations. Success factors of a specific destination can then be enhanced if applied to a specific tourism product that could achieve sustainable growth over the longer term. The objective of this paper is to present an analysis on Romania`s competitiveness as a tourism destination, based on Porter`s diamond model. Throughout the analysis, we focus on the most competitive export products in the industry and their prospects for future growth. As the investigation reveals that opportunities exist for rural tourism in Romania, and due to the special relevance of agritourism in Romania, where the transformation of rural space was accelerated by the process of integration into the European Union, we further channel the competitiveness assessment on this specific tourism product. We find that agritourism allows for a diversification of components of rural economies, which would otherwise be condemned to disappear, entailing high human and economic costs. It also allows to maintain, to protect and even to enhance our heritage and patrimony. We conclude that agritourism can make a valuable contribution to rural economies, and provide several potential benefits. A sustainable development of agritourism is likely to generate: job retention and creation, farm support, landscape conservation, support to rural arts and crafts, nature conservation, environmental improvements, and enhanced role of local communities."

However, research on full parsing, even shallow parsing and POS tagging for Chinese electronic medical record (CEMR), has not been carried out because of the lack of annotated corpus on CEMR. In this paper, we built a corpus of 5,024 sentences from CEMR with word segmentation, POS tags and phrase tags, of them, 2,553 are annotated as full parsing trees. Inter-annotator agreement results: Chinese word segmentation (97.56%), POS tagging (93.34%), shallow parsing (96.5%), full parsing (91.22%). A lexical and syntactic analysis system for CEMR is developed and evaluated based on above corpus. Of its components, we proposed a joint model for word segmentation and POS tagging with the transformation-based error-driven model as correction postprocessing to alleviate the problem of error accumulation, the F1-score of word segmentation and POS tagging were 94.39% and 93.2%, respectively. A shallow parsing model under the framework of group learning we proposed was developed, which enriched word features by word embedding from large unlabeled CEMRs and achieved the F1-score of 96.3%. At last, we presented a state-of-art full parser combining the Berkeley parser and the Stanford parser to outperform the best single parser by 3.68%. The evaluation results show a substantial benefit to statistical machine learning models from the annotated CEMR.

Green algal waste biomass, the residue of M. reisseri KGE33 after oil extraction, was used as the biomaterial. The adsorption of Cu(II) on IMS was tested in batch experiments with varying algal doses, pH, contact times, initial Cu(II) concentrations, and temperatures. Three types of IMSs (IMS 14, 70, and 100) were synthesized according to different algal doses. The removal efficiency of Cu(II) in the aqueous phase was in the following order: IMS 14 (77.0 %) < IMS 70 (83.3 %) < IMS 100 (87.1 %) at pH 5. The point of zero charge (PZC) value of IMS100 was 4.5, and the optimum pH for Cu(II) adsorption was 5. Equilibrium data were described using a Langmuir isotherm model. The Langmuir model maximum Cu(II) adsorption capacity (q (m)) increased with the algal dose in the following order: IMS 100 (1.710 mg g(-1)) > IMS 70 (1.548 mg g(-1)) > IMS 14 (1.282 mg g(-1)). The pseudo-second-order equation fitted the kinetics data well, and the value of the second-order rate constant increased with increasing algal dose. Gibbs free energies (Delta GA degrees) were negative within the temperature range studied, which indicates that the adsorption process was spontaneous. The negative value of enthalpy (Delta HA degrees) again indicates the exothermic nature of the adsorption process. In addition, SEM-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses of the IMS surface reveal that the algal biomass on IMS is the main site for Cu(II) binding. This study shows that immobilized microalgae using silica, a synthesized biosorbent, can be used as a cost-effective sorbent for Cu(II) removal from the aqueous phase.</P>"

Glucosinolates such as glucoraphanin, glucobrassicin, glucoerucin and isothiocyanates, i.e. sulforaphane, which is produced through the enzymatic action of myrosinase are getting focus as their bioactivities. In this study, we treated broccoli with pulsed electric field (PEF) processing and the metabolite profiles were investigated based on the metabolomics analysis. PEF process was applied to stem and floret of broccolis with three different levels; 500, 1000, 1500 pulses with 2 kV/cm, then metabolites were extracted with 70% methanol. Metabolomic analysis was carried out with mass spectrometry through multivariate statistical analysis based on the OPLS-DA model. Significant changes of metabolite profiles were observed by PEF treatment and specific metabolites were affected as dose dependent manner. Content of major glucosinolates compounds such as glucoerucin, glucoiberin, glucoraphanin, glucobrassicin, 4-hydroxy glucobrassicin, and 4-methoxy glucobrassicin were significantly reduced, while sulforaphane was distinctively increased in PEF treated broccolis. The results implied that myrosinase released from vacuole by PEF processing transformed glucosinolate into isothiocyanate, which would be useful findings for enhancing bioactivity of broccoli by simple PEF treatment."

The Good News brought by these missionaries liberated individuals from old traditions and gave the people hope of national independence from Japan. Many Korean women especially experienced conversion and successful transformation. Among them, Kim Maria(1892-1944) was a role model for other Korean women. This paper examines the missiological perspective of Kim’s thoughts and activities. Kim was born into a first-generation Christian family and was a pioneer in Korean Christianity. She lived out her identity as a Korean, a female, and an educator. As a Korean, she participated in the Feb 8 Declaration of Independence and the Mar 1 Independence Movement in 1919 for which she was arrested, imprisoned, and tortured. As a woman, she tried to realize her ideal of gender equality in her every activity. She formed Korean Patriotic Women’s Association for the national independence movement. She was also the president of the National Organization of the Korean Presbyterian Women. As an educator, Kim taught students at Speer Girls’School and Martha Wilson Seminary. Kim died of the aftereffects of torture before she could witness Korea’s liberation. Kim was a leader who transformed the lives of oppressed women in Korea. As a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies to produce much fruit, her contribution and death liberated Korean women and the nation. Her missional life continues to inspire Korean women and others around the world still under gender, economic, political, or spiritual oppression."

The terminal velocity, DSD and two forms of kinetic energy(KE, Jm<sup>-2</sup> mm<sup>-1</sup>; KER, Jm<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> ) of open rainfall drops were determined and were compared with those of throughfall drops under two different canopy heights. The effects of the canopy and rainfall intensity, together with wind speed, on the changes in drop size and kinetic energy of throughfall were evaluated. Throughfall drops were larger than open rainfall drops. The distribution of terminal velocities for the drop sizes measured at Th2 was lower than that at Op; however, at Th1 the distribution was similar to that at Op. The total kinetic energy of throughfall at Th1 and Th2 was higher than the total kinetic energy of open rainfall, and the kinetic energy distribution for the drop sizes was similar to the drop size distribution. The observed throughfall-KER at Th1 was lower than an estimate previously produced using a model. The overestimation from the modeled value at Th1 was likely to be due to overestimated values of a square root transformation of fall height and its coefficient in the model because the distributions of terminal velocity for the drop size measured at Th1 were similar to those of open rainfall."

Deformation was used to create designs by way of distortion and deformation. Exaggeration thereby showing visually strong impression and inducing surprise and unexpectedness. Depaysement was useful to let us describe concepts and enhance our infinite creativity and interests about objects using surrealistic. Secondly, Infantile characteristics used the images of toys with infantile imagination and sense of humor. Fantasy introduced objects or expressed a dream-like feeling. Unexpectedness used two-faced ideas or conflicting ideas to express conflicts, collision and an interchange with heterogeneous things, avoiding the limit of size and the simplicity of materials. Parody used jocular expressions, satire and ironic expressions to express the original image in a fun manner. Exaggeration transformed changed the structure to restructure objects in a subjective and creative manner, thereby expressing creative patterns using various subject matters by way of special modeling or distortion and transformation."
effect of bexarotene on differentiation of glioblastoma multiforme compared with atra,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive malignant brain tumor. Since differentiation can attenuate or halt the growth of tumor cells, an image-based phenotypic screening was performed to find out drugs inducing morphological differentiation of GBMs. Bexarotene, a selective retinoid X receptor agonist, showed strong inhibition of neurospheroidal colony formation and migration of cultured primary GBM cells. Bexarotene treatment reduced nestin expression, while significantly increasing glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression. The effect of bexarotene on gene expression profile was compared with the activity of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a well-known differentiation inducer. Both drugs largely altered the gene expression pattern into a tumor-ameliorating direction. These drugs increased the gene expression levels of Kruppel-like factor 9 (KLF9), regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4), growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4), and lowered the level of chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4). However, transglutaminase 2 (TG2) induction, an adverse effect of ATRA, was much weaker in bexarotene treated primary GBM cells. Consistently, the TG2 enzymatic activity was negligibly affected by bexarotene treatment. It is important to control TG2 overexpression since its upregulation is correlated with tumor transformation and drug resistance. Bexarotene also showed in vivo tumoricidal effects in a GBM xenograft mouse model. Therefore, we suggest bexarotene as a more beneficial differentiation agent than ATRA for GBM.</P>"

Whenexamined words created in our daily lives, this study discovered that many of them are far from the word-formation education of school grammar. Thus, this study intends to propose the necessity of introducing cognitive grammar perspectives to the school grammar education.  All the studies on Korean words can be mostly divided into three flows, traditional grammar, structuralism and transformational generative grammar. Having been established with such flows, the Korean school grammar accepts an eclectic system that includes particles in words, but excludes endings from words. In other words, there are some opinions that both particles and endings should be recognized as words, and other opinions that neither of them should be excluded from words, so this system makes a compromise between them and is selected for the sake of grammar description. From this perspective, a new linguistic research flow should be reflected, but the concept of words has not changed at all. Therefore, it is necessary to reflect cognitive grammar, a usage-based model.  Cognitive grammar pursues bottom-up principles. In this aspect, words are regarded as structured inventory of conventional linguistic units. With such a concept of words adopted, this study insists that it is needed to introduce even ‘Wordization of Syntactic Construction’, beyond the present school grammar that has dual perspectives on compound words as ‘Compound’ and ‘Derivation’. The present school grammar concept of words has changed from a perspective of composition to a perspective of formation. Even the perspective of word formation has been comprehended from a perspective of rule. Recently, however, Korean word formation is explained not with rules but as a cognitive process called ‘Inference’. Therefore, this study found it necessary to introduce cognitive grammar perspectives to the present Korean grammar education."

It can be said that it is considered as an important space expressing the identity of the city, and it has both sides as a complex space of interests. Because the old city center of a large city is a space that has been formed for a long time, it should be approached carefully in terms of development or new policy establishment.

However, short-term labor contracts often led to prolonged stay or settlement, depending on the needs and desires of the migrants or those of the receiving countries. This was where the dilemma of labor migration lay, much the same as today’s many problems stemming from global migration.Labor migration during the colonial period consisted mainly of forced mobilization of individual laborers into the original country and the mass migration of family units into Machuria as a colonization policy. But later, during the Cold War period, labor migration largely took the form of offshore migration of individual laborers to Germany and the Middle East region. This change signalled a transition into a postcolonial and developmentalist model of labor migration. It also meant that the grand division of the East Asian region was fundamentally restricting inshore labor migration.On the other hand, since the collapse of the Cold War and sweeping globalization, offshore migration has been decreasing while inshore migration has been on the rise, and the East Asian region is finding itself more and more on the receiving end of migration. These are clear signs of the post-Cold War and global era that we are in. Nevertheless, the oversees dispatch of North Korean laborers continues to grow, as does the migration of ethnic Koreans in China into Korea, lending a prognosis of the diasporic changes to come out of North Korea’s social transformation. It can therefore be said that the North Korean defectors into South Korea are carrying out the role of a litmus test of diasporic labor migration."

The results of numerical simulations were validated with the field data collected at several different locations in the study area in February, 2014. From the numerical simulations, it was found that waves and currents were significantly influenced in terms of direction and magnitude by bottom topography characterized by straggling rock crops covered with sea grasses. The coupling of SWAN and Delft3D models also revealed that alongshore currents directing from the east to the west were developed in the nearshore, due to the influence of larger waves with the main incident direction from the east."

Confusion of moral values brought on by the societal upheaval makes ministering difficult. In order to help the lay church members cope with these confounding changes, there are a number of approach models, including mentor model, traditional model and reformed model, to the ministry. This article takes the reformed model as the foundation and biblical counseling ministry as the principle of contemporary ministry. Biblical counseling is a method of counseling that takes the bible as the basis of all counseling principles and methods. Therefore, in order for a proper practice of biblical counseling, it is necessary to formulate and articulate the principles of biblical counseling. Such principles must be the basis of counseling ministry, which must aim to not only resolve the spiritual, physical and psychological difficulties faced by lay Christians in contemporary society but also fundamentally transform their lives through the Holy Spirit and the bible. The ultimate purpose of biblical counseling ministry is to help Christians live their lives for the glory of God. Counseling ministry, therefore, cannot be carried out only through one`s passion or compassion, and it requires a systematic training in theology, principles and practice methods of biblical counseling. For the purpose of such ministry, this article offers biblical counseling as an alternative model of contemporary Christian ministry and examines practice methods and ways of expanding and spreading biblical counseling in the Korean church."

This paper presents the physical mechanisms and experimental researches on partial discharge (PD) of oil-paper insulation at pulsating DC voltage. Theoretical analysis showed that the phase-resolved distributions of PDs generated from different insulated models varied as the increase of the applied voltages following a certain rule. Four artificial insulation defect models were designed to generate PD signals at pulsating DC voltages. Theoretical statements and experimental results show that the PD pulses first appear at the maximum value of the applied pulsating DC voltage, and the resolved PD phase distribution became wider as the applied voltage increased. The PD phase-resolved distributions generated from the different discharge models are also different in the phase-resolved distributions and development progress. It implies that the theoretical analysis is suitable for interpretation of PD at pulsating DC voltage."

The danwei system which has existed in the Northeast region of China is called typical danwei system, because the typicality of danwei system was much more prominent, compared with those of the other regions. With the deconstruction of danwei system, there has been formed a society-led shequ model in Dalian, a city of heavy industries in the Northeast region. This paper argues that the formation of society-led shequ model does not necessarily signify that the state has granted some autonomy to the society or the society has acquired some autonomy from the state in the reform era. Rather, this paper argues that the model means that the historical legacies of typical danwei system has influenced the transformations of social management system. In other words, socioeconomic protection was given to people by danwei (not by the state) in the socialist era, and with the deconstruction of danwei, shequ has emerged to give that protection to people in place of danwei. Hence, the seeming autonomy of society-led shequ model to the state should be analyzed in consideration of the historical legacies of typical danwei system which still has some influences in this region."
content based dynamic texture analysis and synthesis based on spiht with gpu,2016,"['Discrete Wavelet Transform', 'Dynamic Texture', 'GPU', 'SPIHT', 'SVD']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Dynamic textures are videos that exhibit a stationary property with respect to time (i.e., they have patterns that repeat themselves over a large number of frames). These patterns can easily be tracked by a linear dynamic system. In this paper, a model that identifies the underlying linear dynamic system using wavelet coefficients, rather than a raw sequence, is proposed. Content based threshold filtering based on Set Partitioning in a Hierarchical Tree (SPIHT) helps to get another representation of the same frames that only have low frequency components. The main idea of this paper is to apply SPIHT based threshold filtering on different bands of wavelet transform so as to have more significant information in fewer parameters for singular value decomposition (SVD). In this case, more flexibility is given for the component selection, as SVD is independently applied to the different bands of frames of a dynamic texture. To minimize the time complexity, the proposed model is implemented on a graphics processing unit (GPU). Test results show that the proposed dynamic system, along with a discrete wavelet and SPIHT, achieve a highly compact model with better visual quality, than the available LDS, Fourier descriptor model, and higher-order SVD (HOSVD)."

Using the Fermi-Bose equivalence in one dimension, we map the model onto a massless Thirring model with a boundary interaction. A field theoretical perturbation theory for the model has been developed, and the chiral symmetry is found to play an important role. The classical bulk action possesses a global UA(1)4 chiral symmetry because the fermion fields are massless. This global chiral symmetry is broken by the boundary interaction, and the bosonic degrees of freedom, corresponding to a chiral phase transformation, become dynamical. They acquire an additional kinetic action from the fermion path-integral measure and govern the critical behaviors of the physical operators. On the critical line where the boundary interaction becomes marginal, they decouple from the fermi fields. Consequently, the action reduces to the free-field action, which contains only a fermion bilinear boundary mass term as an interaction term. By using a renormalization group analysis, we obtain a new critical line, which differs from the previously known critical lines in the literature. The result of this work implies that the phase diagram of the one-dimensional electron system may have a richer structure than previously thought."

The two-dimensional analysis has contributed to our understanding of the hydraulic effects induced by shift of the weir on the topography, especially wetlands.The tide and flow discharge data of 2007 and 2012 were adopted as an input data for model validation and simulation. The tidal data contained both spring and neap tides, and the flow discharge condition was divided into monsoon and normal seasons.The boundaries of this study were Jamsil weir at Han River, Tongil Bridge at Imjin River, and Yu Island at yellow sea. The numerical model which was used as a tool to simulate the flow field was calibrated and verified based on the measured data acquired from Jeonlyu station. The simulation results showed that influence area of seawater changed depending on the weir shift, and the water level at particular station fluctuated according to the condition of tide and flow discharge. Especially the low-tide level increases seriously due to the weir shift at Janghang wetland located in Han River Estuary. It is expected that the wetlands where an area of land consists of soil saturated with moisture are transformed into completely submerged land.Due to weir removal, the influence area of the tidal flow is extended slightly at Han River. The impact point of tidal flow and river flow moves toward upstream, from Hangang Bridge to Dongjak Bridge during spring tide."
humanship: branding of human strength,2016,"['humanship', 'branding', 'human strength', 'transformative consumer research']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper will discuss the role of humanship in marketing non-profit, for-profit, and public policy. Humanship is defined as leadership in one’s life or self-sponsorship through finding an optimal balance between awareness and action by focusing on one’s internal locus of control. In essence, it reflects the need to bring the ‘human’ back to the center stage as the end and not just the means to service, product, and policy delivery. In addition, strengths perspective is presented as the theoretical foundation of branding of such human strength—highlighting the benefit of tapping into one’s strengths in generating positive program outcomes (non-profit), favorable product image and increased sales (for-profit), and improved policy impact (public policy). The added value of branding humanship has to do with the consumers’ shift in seeking the virtues that define quality of life, happiness, and meaning in life as they relate to services, products, and policies.Since of the inception of the Association for Consumer Research (ACR) with the mission “to improve the quality of life and well-being of consumers,” consumer researchers contributed to Consumer Transformative Research (TCR) movement have investigated various areas of social problems such as poverty (Blocker, Ruth, Sridharan, Beckwith, Ekici, Goudie-Hutton, et al., 2013), health (Criag, Burton, & Netemeyer, 2009; Grier & Kumanyika, 2009; Anderson & Ozanne, 2009), motivation (Burroughs, Chaplin, Pandelaere, Norton, Ordabayeva, Gunz, & Dinauer, 2013) as well as multiple methodological considerations. There is much more to be done in this arena for future TCR research and application of humanship as a new concept to make the human agent the empowered driver of non-profit, for-profit, and public decisions for whom the ultimate benefits will return.The human-centered approach empowers the consumers and will ultimately closes the gap in the principal-agent dilemma—who is the end beneficiary—in the ever more contracted out development of services, products and policies in the context of seller- buyer relationships. This requires transforming the traditional model of focusing on the ‘how’ through transactional relationships—normalized by the ‘give and take’ interactions in market economy—to a new model that values the question of ‘why’ consumers will decide to use the services, products, and policies. Therefore, branding based on humanship becomes a significant strategy in any organizational management. This paper discusses benefits and challenges of branding human strength are discussed in the context of working with low-income consumers through two case studies: Transforming Impossible into Possible (TIP) in Chicago, USA and DAIL Community in South Korea."

study on target information recognition method of acoustic detection array,2016,"['acoustic detection', 'array structure', 'time-requency domain transform', 'information identification']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Aiming to the traditional acoustic detection array with measuring the target coordinate, the accuracy of measurement data is affected by the propagation velocity of the acoustic pressure. This paper proposes a new measurement method, which obtain the mathematical model of the target parameter information when the target passing through acoustic sensor array based on acoustic array structure establish. From the model the target parameter information is just associated with the respective probe element’s delay time of the acoustic pressure when the target passing through the acoustic detector, thereby it is effective to avoid the measurement accuracy influence from acoustic pressure velocity of the target parameter information. In order to obtaining the signal characteristics when the target passing through acoustic detector array, it would adopt time-frequency transform method to analyzed signals of the target through the acoustic array. By the simulation experiment it can improve the measurement precision of the target parameters information, and get frequency-domain characteristics of target information based on the measured analog signals of acoustic pressure. The result is benefit to enhance precision of target parameter information from acoustic array detection system, and it has certain guiding significance for the study of acoustic array structure."

micro-mechanical approach for spanwise periodically and heterogeneously beam-like structures,2016,"['Homogenization', 'Dimensional reduction', 'Variational asymptotic method', 'Generalized Timoshenko model', 'Beam-like structures', 'Transverse shear deformations']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper discusses a refined model for investigating the micro-mechanical behavior of beam-like structures, which are composed of various elastic moduli and complex geometries varying through the cross-section directions and are also periodically-repeated and heterogeneous along the axial direction. Following the previous work (Lee and Yu, 2011), the original three-dimensional static problem is first formulated in a unified and compact form using the concept of decomposition of the rotation tensor. Taking advantage of the smallness of the cross-sectional dimension-to-length parameter and the micro-to-macro heterogeneity, while also performing homogenization along the dimensional reduction simultaneously, the variational asymptotic method is rigorously used to construct a total energy function, which is asymptotically correct up to the second order. Furthermore, through the transformation procedure based on the pure kinematic relations and the linearized equilibrium equations, a generalized Timoshenko model is systematically established. For the purpose of dealing with realistic and complex geometries and constituent materials at the microscopic level, this present approach is incorporated into a commercial analysis package. A few examples available in literature are used to demonstrate the consistency and efficiency of this proposed model, especially for the structures, in which the effects of transverse shear deformations are significant."

Particularly, the cultural level among the western and eastern provinces is a big difference of degree, and the Romanization in these areas may be discriminatory. Therefore, the Roman empire not executed in a uniform manner the Romanization of western and eastern provinces and applied the Romanization in a different way according to the degree of cultural level in these areas. Then, Augustus tried to restore the existing culture of high standard as a goal of Romanization in the eastern provinces and to aim at the establishment of new order basing on the Romanization in the western provinces.  Although the Romanization of provinces in the Roman empire showed the difference among the western and eastern provinces, this grew from not the distinction cultural level but the locational difference considering that the Roman empire put the peace above the cultural propagation. Also, the Romanization of provinces could be divided into the theory of province-oriented bottom up and the theory of empire-oriented top down. However, this cannot be concluded from one side view. Therefore, it is desirable to understand the Romanization of provinces basing on two mixed theory. In light of this view, the roll of elites is important for the Romanization of provinces. While the Roman empire zeroed in on the order and the peace of provinces and tried to spread the Roman lifestyle by luring the elites of provinces, the elites of provinces expressed inherent factors which interacted with the roman culture. The elites of provinces granted the Roman citizenship in reward for official business and achieved the legal and economic privilege. The Roman citizenship eradicated the differentiation of the ruler and the governed and the elites of provinces progressed to the elites of Roman empire.  In this way, the elites of provinces created the new culture through the Romanization. Ultimately, many elites regarded themselves as Romans. The loyalty of provincial elites for the Roman empire not surprised. Because the tolerance in Roman empire considered the morality and the cultural heritage of province as the culture of new empire. In the cultural level of province, this transformation is the product of negotiation between the practical objective of Rome to reduce administrative expense and the aspiration of provincial elites. Because the new system to create acculturation elevated the social status of provincial elites. The ostentation of their fame acted as the important motive in order to apply new ideas and objectives."

Following the self-determination theory, autonomous motivation is defined as three types: intrinsic motivation, integrated motivation, and identified motivation. Adopted are job characteristics and transfor-mational leadership as the antecedents of autonomous motivation. The five job characteristics are measured at the individual level, while transformational leadership is operationalized at the group level in terms of three components: vision sharing, intellectual stimulation, and individual consideration. The leadership variables are hypothesized to exert cross-level influences on autonomous motivation. The three types of autonomous motivation are expected to result in active performance behaviors, such as time input, work intensity, and creative problem-solving. We selected an IT venture company in Korea and surveyed all employee members of the company, thus obtaining 417 respondents from 37 teams. To test the research model, multilevel structural equations modeling was conducted by using Mplus 7.4. The advantage of Multi-level SEM is to allow us to examine all linkages among the variables of the multi-level model simultaneously. The results showed that all three types of autonomous motivation were positively related to task significance at individual-level and the vision sharing of transformational leadership at group-level. Job autonomy exerted positive effect on intrinsic motivation, and job feedback showed positive relationship with identified motivation. By contrast, no significant effect were found for task identity, intellectual stimulation, and individual consideration. Each of the autonomous motivation differed in the significant relationships with performance behaviors. Identified motivation was strongly associated with all performance behaviors. Integrated motivation was related to time input and work intensity, while intrinsic motivation showed significant relationship with time input and creative problem-solving. Theoretical and managerial implications are sought from the empirical findings. The limitations and future research directions are also discussed."

The second objective is to explore healthy self-identity for Methodist missionaries as well as a theologically proper attitude toward mission field from a Methodist perspective. To do this, the author appropriates Joerg Rieger’s categorization of mission models as “outreach, relationship, and inreach” for his own use. In particular, the author interprets Rieger’s “mission as inreach” model in light of a Wesleyan perspective.  The “mission as outreach” model has been predominant in the churches of the colonial and neocolonial periods, including the Methodist Church. The majority of contemporary local churches consider mission in terms of outreach activities. Strategies of “mission as outreach” during the colonial period were directly or indirectly linked to the policies of the colonial government. Further, in the later neocolonial period, mission was connected with capitalism as the economic power of “free market.” In this context, missionary works (in particular, those of Western missionaries) have left uncurable scars and trauma to indigenous people in the mission field.  The concepts of “mission as relationship” and “mission as inreach” in Joerg Rieger offer better alternatives to remedy the defects of the “mission-as-outreach” perspective. However, both have respective weaknesses. The perspective of “mission as relationship” tends to generate an asymmetrical relationship between missionaries and those who are to be evangelized(or proselytized), both in its appropriation into mission fields and in its theological understanding. The perspective of “mission as inreach” had advantage in its conviction that God is the first missionary. It also emphasizes the idea that mission begins not with the conversion of the other, but with the conversion of the missionary himself/herself. Its problem lies in its undue emphasis on “mission as inreach,” which can lead missionaries to the belief that God’s works are unilateral and which can lead them to a failure to find one’s proper role and place in God’s mission. The author is confident that the weakness of the “mission as inreach” perspective can be overcome by Wesley’s thought and then can be appropriated for Methodism because Wesley’s theology emphasizes not only God’s initiative but also human participation in God’s mission."
fsspcm: fuzzy publication of data for privacy preserving,2016,"['Privacy Preserving Data Publishing', 'Fuzzy Semantic', 'Set Pair Analysis', 'Cloud Model']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The rapid development of information technology makes it convenient to release, collect, store and analyze various types of data. At the same time, how to protect the privacy of individual and prevent disclosure of sensitive information during data publication has become a major challenge. K-anonymity method is the most widely used privacy protection model and has been well researched. However, generalization and suppression operations used in K-anonymity methods require high computational effort and cause excessive loss of original information, which will greatly reduce the availability of data after publishing. The paper proposed a transformation algorithm for privacy preserving data publishing based on fuzzy semantic set pair cloud model (FSSPCM). It transforms the sensitive attributes into the form of fuzzy semantic values, and privacy of individual has been maintained because exact values cannot be predicted after data publishing. In order to enhance the availability of data after publishing, semantic distinction (SD) and reserve degree (RD) are designed to reflect relationships between original data and fuzzy semantic information after transformation according to different characteristics of numerical sensitive attributes and categorical sensitive attributes. Experiments and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method both on numerical and categorical sensitive attributes. Classification performed on original and transformed information proves the proposed method maintains higher clustering similarity after fuzzy transformation, which will provide better availability for data mining and other processing."

The phenol adsorption efficiency of AC-K800 was significantly improved above 97% of initial concentration(50mg/L) by pre-treatment. The maximum adsorption capacity (44.40 mg/g) of phenol by AC-K800 was observed at a slightly acidic condition (pH 4). From the kinetic experiment results, it was shown that the adsorption equilibrium was attained after 360 mins. The kinetic data showed good fitting with the pseudo first and second order models (R2 >0.990). The equilibrium adsorption of phenol well fitted by the Langmuir model and the adsorption capacity was 326.55 mg/g. From these results, it was concluded that AC-K800, as a pretreated absorbent, can be successfully applied to remove phenol from the aqueous solution."

So, in much of the work on patent data analysis, the researchers transformed the patent documents into structured data using text mining techniques. Generally, thestructured data set has a sparsity problem, that is, most elements of the data are zero valued. The existing researches in patent analysis have not considered this zero-inflated problem, but it places serious limits on performance when we analyze the patent data.

FWI can update velocity as reducing the residual between the observed and estimated data which can be obtained by solving wave equation. Therefore, when we carry out 2D FWI with 3D data acquired in a field, critical problems happen in FWI, because 2D and 3D wave equations have different green functions. To overcome the problem we suggest 2D plane-wave FWI method using plane-wave gathers, which are transformed from 3D data, as observed data.Since plane-wave data follow 1D green function, the differences of amplitude and phase do not occur, it means that we can implement FWI by using different dimension data.

There are a large number of image steganography techniques proposed till date but negligible research has been done on the development of a standard quality evaluation model for judging their performance. Existence of such a model is important for fueling the development of superior techniques and also paves the way for the improvement of the existing ones. However, the common quality parameters often considered for performance evaluation of an image steganography technique are insufficient for overall quantitative evaluation.

safety analysis of structures with probability and evidence theory,2016,"['safety analysis', 'epistemic uncertainty', 'evidence theory', 'probability theory']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In safety analysis of structures, classical probabilistic analysis has been a popular approach in engineering. However, it is not always to obtain sufficient information to model all uncertain parameters of structures system by probability theory, especially at early stage of design. Under this circumstance, probability theory (used to model random uncertainty) combined with evidence theory (used to model epistemic uncertainty) may be utilized in safety analysis of structures. This paper proposed a novel method for safety analysis of structures based on probability and evidence theory. Firstly, Bayes conversion method is used as the way for precision of evidence body, and the mean and variance of epistemic uncertain variables is defined. Then epistemic uncertainty variables is transformed to normal random variables by reflection transformation method, and the checking point method (J-C method) is used to solve most probability point and reliability.

redesigning marketing resources for product innovations -– the evidence from polish companies,2016,"['marketing resources reconfiguration', 'product innovations', 'dynamic capabilities', 'contingency effects']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Marketing literature have widely discussed the interplay between marketing capabilities (i.e. company resources and competences in marketing-mix area), market orientation, company innovativeness and company performance (e.g. Knight & Cavusgil, 2004; Luca & Atuahene-Gima, 2007; Moorman & Slotegraaf, 1999; Morgan, Vorhies, & Mason, 2009). However, these studies presented static view of marketing capabilities and resources which becomes less and less relevant in today uncertain market environments (Day, 2011). In this study we follow dynamic capability view (DCV) in management research (Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000; Teece, Pisano, & Shuen, 1997) and we distinguish dynamic marketing capabilities (DMC) from other dynamic capabilities, company resources and competencies (Barrales - Molina, Mart?nez - L?pez, & G?zquez - Abad, 2014; Morgan, 2012). Specifically, we conceptualize Dynamic Marketing Reconfiguration (DMR) as a DMC grounded explicitly in dynamic capability view and we provide empirical test for a research model, where DMR is hypothesized as factor complementing Market Orientation and influencing on company product innovation success. Corresponding with contingency theory (Donaldson, 2001; Drazin & Van de Ven, 1985), in this study we hypothesize and test the idea that DMR is a company capability that is in a good “fit” with certain organizational and environmental factors. Morgan (2012) and Barrales - Molina, et al. (2014) have proposed dynamic marketing capabilities (DMC) aligned with concepts of “market knowledge” and “marketing resources” and they distinguish DMC from other company capabilities (e.g. manufacturing capabilities, SCM capabilities). Recent marketing literature illustrated empirically that there are actually various DMCs that the focal company may utilize to achieve competitive advantage. For example, Narver, Slater & MacLachlan (2004) focus on Proactive Market Orientation that enable dynamic sensing and satisfying unconscious consumer needs through new product development. Weerawardena, et al. (2015) tested the impact of global dynamic marketing capability and market focused learning on innovation performance and company early internationalization. In this study we focus on specific dynamic marketing capability that complements prior works in this area, namely Dynamic Marketing Reconfiguration (DMR). In line with DCV we conceptualize DMR as company routines oriented at transforming market knowledge into modified and new configurations of marketing resources that are better aligned with market changes. Corresponding with prior studies on static marketing resources and capabilities (Knight & Cavusgil, 2004; Moorman & Slotegraaf, 1999; Morgan, Vorhies, & Mason, 2009), we argue that DMR utilizes such static resources dynamically by systematic enriching and combining them, and,as the consequence, the company equipped with advanced DMR can improve their alignment with the market environment. We do not assume that DMR equals strategy orientating company only at new marketing resources (e.g. utilizing new market knowledge, implementing new advertising instruments, brand repositioning, entering new market segments), but rather at improved configurations of marketing resources (e.g. combing existing resources and marketing experience with new marketing tools in effective way). Our conceptualization of DMR mirrors some real marketing practices that are observable in case of companies operating successfully in regional markets and companies operating on global scale today. The spectacular illustration of DMR is Disney corporation strategy with regard to their new product “Star Wars: the Force Awakens” that was released in December 2015. Disney have implemented very dynamic, innovative and massive approach to promotion of their new product, complementing their traditional advertising tools (e.g. TV advertisement, toys) by modern instruments, such as fan events, new computer games, cartoons and PR in social media (Bart, 2015; Schwartz, 2015). The positive influence of Market Orientation (MO) on company product innovations and company performance was widely discussed in prior studies (Atuahene-Gima, 1996; Han, Kim, & Srivastava, 1998; Hurley & Hult, 1998; Kumar, Jones, Venkatesan, & Leone, 2011). Following Narver, et al. (2004), in this study we treat MO as business’s attempt to understand and to satisfy customers’ needs. Such understanding is useful at every stage of new product development. Additionally, MO does not help the company only through positive impact on product innovativeness, but also through leveraging effectiveness of all marketing resources and instruments, because they are aligned with knowledge about customer needs. Thus, we hypothesize: H1.1: The higher Market Orientation of the company, the stronger success of its product innovations. H1.2: The higher Market Orientation of the company, the better company performance. Dynamic Marketing Reconfiguration (DMR) complements company MO in attempts to improve product innovation success, because understanding and satisfying customer needs present rather static approach to marketing-market alignment. MO is not enough in today volatile markets, when company needs to constantly reconfigure marketing resources to develop and, especially commercialize, new products (Day, 2011; Barrales - Molina, et al. 2014). DMR does not only influence positively on product innovations, but it also directly influences on company performance. Systematically adjusting marketing resources to changes in market environment leverages sales of all company products, not only newly introduced ones. Therefore, we hypothesize: H2.1: The higher Dynamic Marketing Reconfiguration in the company, the stronger success of its product innovations. H2.2: The higher Dynamic Marketing Reconfiguration in the company, the better company performance. This research is focused on product (offering) innovations as the key innovation outcome of a firm’s marketing routines. Product innovation has been established in the management and strategy literature as an important driver of firm performance (e.g. Han et al., 1998). Thus, our hypothesis is:H3: The stronger Product Innovation Success, the better company performance. Companies do not operate in a vacuum, so this study follows contingency theory that postulates finding the “fit” between environmental contingencies and internal configurations within the company (Donaldson, 2001; Van de Ven & Drazin, 1984). So far, only a few studies applying dynamic capabilities perspective have discussed the role of contingencies which creates a research gap for our understanding of DCV (Barreto, 2010). Such research gap is even more visible with regard to our knowledge of dynamic marketing capabilities (DMC), because prior empirical studies in this area have largely ignored contingencies, except environmental uncertainty and firm age (Flatten, et al., 2015). Consequently, in this study we analyse the role of two contingency factors, namely: company size (internal configuration) and industry norms related to product customization (external configuration). Prior studies have presented blurred picture of the role of company size, because dynamic capabilities were also found effective in case of small enterprises (Døving & Gooderham, 2008; Salvato, 2003). Nevertheless, in this study we incorporate original DCV reasoning, because intuitively, in SMEs company routines may be replaced by other factors that are typical advantages of small scale enterprise. On the extreme point, in micro firms (e.g. below 10 employees), there is no need to standardize certain behaviours among employees at all, because all marketing actions, including planning, execution and control are performed usually by one person. Therefore, we hypothesize: H4.1: The Dynamic Marketing Reconfiguration has stronger influence on Product Innovation Success in big and medium companies in comparison to small companies. Contingency theory suggests controlling for the effects from not only organizational features, but also environmental factors (Donaldson, 2001; Van de Ven & Drazin, 1984). We follow Lampel & Mintzberg (1996) suggestion that “…some industries favour customization and some foster standardization…” (p. 21) and we assume that all industries may be distinguished into two main categories: High customization industry vs. Low customization industry. Such distinction is based on perceived dominance of customization vs. standardization practices among competing companies and it may be treated as a proxy to the popularization of relationship marketing strategy (Gr?nroos, 1994) and service-dominant logic (Vargo & Lusch, 2004) in a given industry. In industries, where high product customization function as a norm, the new product development works through collaborative efforts with customers and value co-creation (Hoyer, Chandy, Dorotic, Krafft, & Singh, 2010). Dynamic marketing capabilities oriented at marketing reconfiguration may be not effective in case of companies working in high customization industries, as close customer relationships popular in such industries demand customer trust and commitment rather than dynamic marketing, including utilizing newest marketing instruments (Mitrega & Katrichis, 2010; Palmatier, Dant, Grewal, & Evans, 2006). In sum, we hypothesize: H4.2: The Dynamic Marketing Reconfiguration has weaker influence on Product Innovation Success, when it is implemented in the industry that favours high product customization. We tested our hypotheses on the cross-sectional survey data based on the sample of 155 companies operating in Poland and we applied structural equation modeling(PLS-SEM) to estimate the hypothesized research model using SmartPLS 3.0 (Hair, Hult, Ringle, & Sarstedt, 2013; Ringle, Wende, & Becker, 2014). As our conceptualization of DMR is grounded in the dynamic capabilities view, we searched for such scales for this construct, which would reflect actions standardized among managers and other people involved in marketing (Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000; Teece, 2007). Thus, for DMR we have adapted selected scales proposed for dynamic capabilities by Pavlou & El Sawy (2011). The market orientation was measured in line with reactive market orientation (Narver, et al. 2004), product innovation success was measured according to Ritter and Gem?nden (2003) and company performance according to Reinartz et al. (2004). We applied single item measurement for our contingency factors. Specifically, company size was measured due to number of people employed in the company and industry norms with regard to product customization were measured through question: “Please specify, if your industry demands adjusting company offering to individual requirements of a given customer (e.g. detailed negotiations, product adjustments)”. After purifying measurement model through Exploratory Factor Analysis, we retained 18 items for our 4 latent constructs. The items are available by email upon request. Our measurement model received empirical support for its validity and reliability with regard to literature suggestions, i.e. AVE > 0.5; Cronbach Alpha >0.7; Alpha and Fornell-Larcker discriminant validity criterion (Fornell & Larcker, 1981; Hair et al., 2012). We conducted PLS-SEM analysis following Hair et al. (2013) suggestions. T-statistics were computed by applying a bootstrapping procedure with 5000 bootstrap samples. The detailed results of model estimation are available upon request. Path coefficients for the research model appeared to be all significant except the link between market orientation and company performance, which supports hypotheses H1.1, H2.1; H2.2 and H3, but rejects H1.2. Additionally, contingency effects were tested using Multi-Group Analysis (MGA) implemented in SmartPLS 3.0 (Ringle, et al.2014). The differences in coefficient for path DMR -> PROD. INNOV SUCCESS were found significant in sub-samples according to company size and according to customization industry norms. Specifically, in case of medium and big companies (n = 71) the influence of DMR on product innovation success was significantly stronger (b=0.59) than in case of small companies (n=84; b = 0.28). In case of companies that did not report product customization as industry norm (n=93) the influence of DMR on product innovation success was significantly stronger (b=0.46) than in case of companies that reported industry pressure on product customization (n=62; b=0.27). Thus, all hypotheses connected with contingency effects (H4.1; H4.2) received support. Our study corresponds with recent research devoted to dynamic marketing capabilities (Flatten, et al, 2015; Weerawardena, et al. 2015) and it enriches this research by looking at DMCs from a different angle. Dynamic Marketing Reconfiguration (DMR) that we focus on embraces explicitly these company routines that transform existing marketing resources into their new combinations better aligned with market changes. Thus, DMR is different to proactive market orientation (Narver, at al. 2004) as such PMO is oriented at latent customer needs, but does not assume marketing reconfiguration, e.g. in terms of utilizing new marketing tools. In contrast to Flatten et al. (2015), DMR does not focus only on dynamic pricing capabilities, but it refers to reconfiguration of all marketing resources (i.e. pricing and other marketing-mix elements as well). Our study validates and enriches study by Weerawardena, et al.(2015), where dynamic marketing capabilities were found as the leverage for innovation performance. Similarly to this recent study, our study also confirms positive influence of dynamic marketing capability on innovation performance, but study by Weerawardena et al. (2015) was limited to early internationalizing firms in US and Australia, so we provide different empirical setting for testing this influence (i.e. companies based in Poland in various stages of their internationalization). More importantly, we qualify Weerawardena et al. (2015) by combining insights from dynamic capabilities theory (Teece et al., 1997) and contingency theory (Donaldson, 2001; Van de Ven & Drazin, 1984) and we test previously neglected contingency effects, namely: company size and industry norms with regard to product customization. Our research results suggest that dynamic marketing capabilities, namely DMR, are especially important for bigger companies and for these companies that are not under pressure for strong product customization. It may mean that DMR should be not applied in case of these companies that follow relationship marketing approach (Palmatier, Scheer, Evans, & Arnold, 2008), especially these companies that operate in B2B settings. In general, our study follows recent call for better understanding of dynamic marketing capabilities through more rigorous conceptualizations and providing tests in various empirical settings (Barrales - Molina, et al, 2014)."
"the antecedents of channel integration in fashion industry: organization strategic orientation, organizational structure, channel strategies",2016,"['channel integration', 'strategic orientation', 'organizational structure', 'channel strategies', 'omni-channel retailing']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Since the arrival of omni-channel retailing, which promotes seamless experience for consumers and zero effort commerce, channel integration has been a big issue in both the domestic and the international retail industry. Some researchers have identified problems that can occur in the process of channel integration, such as cannibalization and channel conflict (Coelho & Easingwood, 2003). However, many studies on channel integration report its positive impact on a firm’s revenue growth through improved trust (Schramm-Klein & Morschett, 2006), higher consumer conversion rates (Neslin et al., 2006), and greater cross-selling opportunities (Berry et al., 2010). Regarding the issue of effectively establishing channel integration in order to bring positive synergy to a company, the present study intends to identify a solution within a company’s internal factors. This study aims to provide a strategic perspective on channel integration formation of domestic fashion retailers by identifying some of the key organizational components that drive a firm’s channel integration in this omni-channel era, when the boundaries between online and offline markets are disappearing. This study predicts that organizational structure and strategic orientation are the key components of a fashion retailer’s channel integration implementation in an omni-channel environment. As shown in previous studies, channel integration has a positive impact on a firm’s performance through active and innovative transformation of the organization’s hardware and software (Cao & Li, 2015; Yan, Wang, & Zhou, 2010). In particular, this study introduces channel (extension) strategies (number of different types of channels in both online and offline markets) into channel integration as one of the crucial variables, in addition to the two existing variables. The data were collected through a survey targeting mid-level executives or above, within a business unit of Korea’s fashion companies with over $10 million revenue. Through this selection, a total of 120 samples were used in the final analysis. Hierarchical regression modeling was used to prove the study’s hypothesis. The revenue size of a parent company and SBU was used as a control variable in the level 1 model; channel strategies in the level 2 model; organizational structure in the level 3 model, and organization strategic orientation in the level 4 model, which was used as an independent variable. Integrated back-end system and integrated human resource management, which are the highest levels of channel integration (Cao & Li, 2015; Oh, Teo, & Sambamurthy, 2012), have been used as dependent variables. The main findings of this study are as follows: In a back-end system integration model, organization strategic orientation was identified as the highest level when the organizational structure becomes more centralized, whereas the system integration level is the highest when the model is competitor-oriented and innovation-oriented. In the human resource management integration model, the human resource management integration level is at its highest when the organizational structure becomes formalized and specialized, and organization strategic behavior becomes more competitor-oriented and innovation-oriented."

This study conducts an empirical analysis on how two distinctive military systems, voluntary system vs. conscription, exert different influences on organizational performance. The research question addresses whether the type of military system creates any behavior differences of soldiers. The proposed structural equation model suggests that soldiers’ organizational commitment is affected directly by the type of military system and indirectly through the levels of job stress and combat competency. The data for the empirical analysis was collected from a survey conducted to 292 soldiers serving in either a Special Forces Brigade (a voluntary military unit) or a Special Assault Commando Regiment (a conscription unit). No statistically significant evidence supports the direct influence of military system type on the level of organizational commitment. Yet, serving in a voluntary military unit is found to decrease the solider’s stress and reinforces military competency, and further improve organizational commitment indirectly. This finding may imply that reducing work stress and enhancing combat competency by improving the soldiers’ quality of life, which is typically better in voluntary military units, can be as important as transforming the military system itself."

In an aligned spatiotemporal image generated by accumulating the pixels on a scanline along the time axis and aligning consecutive scanlines, the trajectory of the lane points appears smooth and forms a straight line. The aligned spatiotemporal image is binarized, and two dominant parallel straight lines resulting from the temporal consistency of lane width on a given scanline are detected using a Hough transform, reducing alignment errors. The left and right lane points are then detected near the intersections of the straight lines and the current scanline. Our spatiotemporal domain approach is more robust missing or occluded lanes than existing frame-based approaches. Furthermore, the experimental results show not only computation times reduced to as little as one-third but also a slightly improved rate of detection.</P>"

In addition, x-ray microCT scan images were used to explore the morphological structure such as embryo size, the amount of endosperm, the area of free space and the seed coat thickness among the high viable and low viable seed. FT-NIR reflectance spectra of both high viable and low viable (naturally aged) seeds were collected in the range of 4,000 - 10,000 cm-1 (1,000 - 2,500 nm). Besides, x-ray images were collected at 360 degrees of each seed where the difference of every scan was 0.795 degree (total 453 scans). 100% accurate result was obtained from the calibration and prediction set derived from the PLS-DA model to classify high viable and low viable seeds. The beta coefficient of PLS-DA showed the spectral difference between high viable and low viable seeds due to the change in the chemical component which might be a reason to vary the germination ability. Healthy embryo and solid and sound endosperm were seen in the high viable seeds while x-ray microCT scan image analysis was performed. A large air space was found in the low viable seeds as a reason of poor structure of endosperm comparing with the high viable seeds. The results demonstrate the possibility of using FT-NIR spectroscopy and x-ray microCT scan image analysis to separate seeds based on viability which is very important in the seed industry."

Corn silage samples (n=407) were collected from cattle farms and feed companies in Korea between 2014 and 2015. Samples of silage were scanned at 1 nm intervals over the wavelength range of 680~2,500 nm. The optical data were recorded as log 1/Reflectance (log 1/R) and scanned in intact fresh condition. The spectral data were regressed against a range of chemical parameters using partial least squares (PLS) multivariate analysis in conjunction with several spectral math treatments to reduce the effect of extraneous noise. The optimum calibrations were selected based on the highest coefficients of determination in cross validation ($R^2{_{cv}}$) and the lowest standard error of cross validation (SECV). Results of this study revealed that the NIRS method could be used to predict chemical constituents accurately (correlation coefficient of cross validation, $R^2{_{cv}}$, ranging from 0.77 to 0.91). The best mathematical treatment for moisture and crude protein (CP) was first-order derivatives (1, 16, 16, and 1, 4, 4), whereas the best mathematical treatment for neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) was 2, 16, 16. The calibration models for fermentation parameters had lower predictive accuracy than chemical constituents. However, pH and lactic acids were predicted with considerable accuracy ($R^2{_{cv}}$ 0.74 to 0.77). The best mathematical treatment for them was 1, 8, 8 and 2, 16, 16, respectively. Results of this experiment demonstrate that it is possible to use NIRS method to predict the chemical composition and fermentation quality of fresh corn silages as a routine analysis method for feeding value evaluation to give advice to farmers."

In today's construction industry, there is an increasing demand for modularization of prefabricated components and control of their dimensional quality during the fabrication and assembly stages. To meet these needs, this study develops a non-contact dimensional quality assurance (DQA) technique that automatically and precisely assesses the key quality criteria of full-scale precast concrete elements. First, a new coordinate transformation algorithm is developed taking into account the scales and complexities of real precast slabs so that the DQA technique can be fully automated. Second, a geometry matching method based on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which relates the as-built model constructed from the point cloud data to the corresponding as-designed BIM model, is utilized for precise dimension estimations of the actual precast slab. Third, an edge and corner extraction algorithm is advanced to tackle issues encountered in unexpected conditions, i.e. large incident angles and external steel bars being located near the edge of precast concrete elements. Lastly, a BIM-assisted storage and delivery approach for the obtained DQA data is proposed so that all relevant project stakeholders can share and update DQA data through the manufacture and assembly stages of the project. The applicability of the proposed DQA technique is validated through field tests on two full-scale precast slabs, and the associated implementation issues are discussed. Field test results reveal that the proposed DQA technique can achieve a measurement accuracy of around 3.0mm for dimension and position estimations."

To avoid the parallel resonance of the LCL topology, the active damping method of the proportional capacitor-current feedback is employed. As to current vector error elimination, an optimized PR controller of the inner current loop is proposed with the zero-pole matching (ZPM) and cancellation method to configure the regulator. The impacts on system's characteristics and stability margin caused by the PR controller and control parameter variations in the inner-current loop are analyzed, and the correlations among active damping feedback coefficient, sampling and transport delay, and system robustness have been established. An equivalent model of the inner current loop is studied via the pole-zero locus along with the pole placement method and frequency response characteristics. Then, the parameter values of the control system are chosen according to their decisive roles and performance indicators. Finally, simulation and experimental results obtained while adopting the proposed method illustrated its feasibility and effectiveness, and the inner current loop achieved zero static error tracking with a good dynamic response and steady-state performance."

A growing body on diversity research has focused the positive or negative effects of objective diversity using heterogeneity index on team performance and exam-ined how diversity itself affected result variables and focused in how such causality was changed and by which factors. However, in spite of this effort, previous studies have shown conflicting result for the effect of diversity. Because people tend to behave positively or negatively according to their perception and awareness towards difference not to diversity per se. Even in a team whose members objectively vary greatly in their attributes, the effect of diversity can vary depending on how the team members respond to the presence of diversity. In this vein, we test and compare the effect of transformational leadership and shared leadership as an important antecedent of diversity attitude. And we also test the moderating effect of non-differential treatment which is formed by a collective attitude of a team where non-discriminating treatment for the characteristics of a colleague`s different background rather than their actions. In a team where an tolerant attitude towards diversity is displayed, this attitude would positively affect individual`s diversity attitude. We adopt multi-level analysis using hierarchical linear modeling in order to verify the effect of two leaderships on diversity attitude and employees` behaviors at individual level and the moderating effect of non-differential treatment at team level respectively. A total of 761 members in 121 teams who work in several industries constituted the sample of this study. Findings of our analysis showed that only shared leaderships had a positive effect on positive diversity attitude. However, we found the significant moderation effect of team`s non-differential treatment by transformational leader-ship on diversity attitude. The finding also indicated that diversity attitude had a positive effect on extra-role behavior and a negative effect on counter-productive work behavior. Based on these findings, we recom-mend that team based organizations should work on providing the substantial support of various realistic diversity training related to employees` attitude towards diversity. It is also advisable for organizations to encourage in-house social programs, aside from official training programs, so that the employees can accept diversity more naturally. And it is worthwhile to check team-level perceptions of diversity for proactive management in practice because the capabilities for sustainable management and success ultimately come from human resource. Lastly we recommended to find another antecedent of positive diversity attitude and another convergent mechanism that could boost the effect of leadership on diversity attitude. We discussed managerial and practical implications of our findings in details."
cloning of a novel endogenous promoter for foreign gene expression in phaeodactylum tricornutum,2016,"['Constitutive expression', 'Glutamine synthetase promoter', 'Phaeodactylum tricornutum', 'Transformation']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Phaeodactylum tricornutum is a model diatom, and its genomic sequence data and expressed sequence tag databases are available. This study was to discover a new endogenous promoter that drives strong constitutive expression of a protein of interest in P. tricornutum. To find promoter candidates, the intracellular proteins of P. tricornutum grown to stationary phase were extracted and identified by LC–MS/MS. Glutamine synthetase (GLNA) was one of the most abundantly expressed proteins during the stationary phase. Promoter is usually located on 5′ upstream region of open reading frame of the gene. Thus, two fragments of 5′ upstream region of the GLNA gene as putative promoters, 501 and 997 bp long, were amplified and cloned into enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (eGFP) reporter systems. The constructed reporter systems were transformed into P. tricornutum and the eGFP expression levels were compared to those of reporter systems using the promoters of fcpA (fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c binding protein A) and CIP1 (putative replication-associated proteins of a Chaetoceros lorenzianus-infecting DNA virus) as controls. The expression of eGFP driven by either GLNA promoter (501 and 997 bp) was linearly related to cell density, and eGFP was expressed constitutively regardless of the cultivation phase. The eGFP expression level driven by the GLNA promoters was at least 4 times higher than the fcpA-driven eGFP expression level at the stationary phase. The 501 and 997 bp regions of the GLNA promoter had similar activity patterns for transcribing the downstream gene. These results indicate that at least 501-bp region of the GLNA promoter can be used as a strong constitutive promoter in genetic engineering of P. tricornutum."
프로젝트 예비비 편성 방법에 관한 연구,2016,"['Project Cost Management', 'Project Risk Management', 'Contingency Reserve', 'Management Reserve']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Many organizations have transformed their business in order to survive and compete in the future. They generate projects by creating a vision, using strategies and objectives with funds aligning strategies and make efforts to complete them successfully because project success leads to business success. All projects have triple constraints such as scope, time, and cost to be completed. Project cost performance is a key factor to achieve project goals and which is mostly related with risks among various cost drivers. Projects require a cost estimation method to complete them within their budget and on time. An accurate budget cannot be estimated due to the uncertainties and risks. Thus some additional money should be funded in addition to the base budget as a contingency reserve for identified risks and a management reserve for unidentified risks. While research on contingency reserve for identified risks included in project budget baseline have been presented, research on management reserve for unidentified risks included in total project budget is still scarce. The lack of research on estimation method and role of the management reserve have made project managers little confidence to estimate project budget accurately with reasonable basis. This study proposes a practical model to estimate budgets including contingency and management reserves for not only project cost management but also to keep the balance of organization’s total funds to maximize return on investments for project portfolio management. The advantages of the proposed model are demonstrated by its application to construction projects in Korea and the processes to apply this model for verification are also provided."

(1) IMF와 같은 경제위기의 경우에도 국가의 안위와 관련된 경우에는 안보위기에 우선하여 위기외교의 긴급의제로 다루어지지만 경제위기가 일정정도 해소되면 북한핵과 같은 안보문제로 관심이 전환된다. (2) 북한과의 정상외교는 그 성과와 무관하게 정치적 수단으로서 성격이 강하기 때문에 정치적인 오해를 불러일으킬 수 있다. (3) 다자외교와 양자외교의 장에서 정상외교가 동시에 진행되지만 실제로 의미있는 의제가 해결되기 보다는 외교절차로서 활용하는 측면이 존재했다. (4) 한국의 정상외교의 비중이 확대되는 것은 국력의 확대에 따른 결과라고 볼 수 있다. 끝으로 (5) 한국의 정상외교가 직면하고 있는 한계는 한국의 안보와 번영에 필수적이라고 할 수 있는 동아시아 주변 4강과의 정상외교에서 상대적 국력의 한계를 극복하고 통일을 추구하는 궁극적 목표에는 여전히 어려움이 있다.","There is a major transformation in the form of diplomatic relations.

Since South Kore is located among the major powers, peace and prosperity of South Korea relies on the external changes. Therefore, the research introduces a theory on the summit diplomacy and apply the model on the Korean cases.There are 7 factors that facilitate the summit diplomacy: (1) the appearance of unprecedented threat and crisis diplomacy, (2) diplomacy policy as a new political tool, (3) the importance of business diplomacy, (4) extension of international community and regionalism, (5) the conflict between career diplomats and politicians, (6) power concentration to the head of government, and (7) development of technology. Except the general factors such as the last four variable, this research will apply the variables to Korean governments’ summit diplomacy on the major powers such as the U.S., China, Japan, and Russia.With the analyses, this research presents a few findings. (1) The economic crisis such as the IMF crisis can override the security issue. However, as soon as the economic crisis is resolved, the security issue such as nuclear threat will soon appear and take over the policy initiative.  (2) Regardless of the achievement, the inter-Korean summit meeting is likely to be regarded as a policy tool to divert the public criticism on domestic policy failure. (3) Although the summit diplomacy of South Korea can utilize the multilateral and bilateral format as well, the summity meeting appear to be a ceremonial protocol rather than a negotiation to resolve a critical issue. (4) The extension of summit diplomacy is a reflection of the improved national power of South Korea. (5) Despite the increased role of South Korean summit meeting, there remain difficulties to cope with the relative power gap with the major powers in order to achieve the national reunification."

aliskiren regulates neonatal fc receptor and igg metabolism with attenuation of anti-gbm glomerulonephritis in mice,2016,"['Inhibitory activity', 'Mouse model', 'Glomerulonephritis', 'Renin']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Background: Renin, in addition to its activation of the reninangiotensin system, binds to the (pro)renin receptor (PRR) and triggers inflammatory and fibrogenic signaling in tissue. In addition, aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor, has been shown to affect IgG metabolism by altering PRR and neonatal Fc receptors (FcRns). Methods: We investigated the effect of aliskiren on proteinuria, glomerular extracellular matrix, expressions of fibronectin, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), PRR, FcRn and renal metabolism of IgG in a mice model of anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis (anti-GBM GN). Results: IgG deposition and expressions of FcRn and PRR were enhanced at glomeruli and urinary IgG levels increased in anti-GBM GN. Aliskiren attenuated anti-GBM GN with reduction of proteinuria and cortical expressions of fibronectin and TGF-beta 1. In addition, aliskiren suppressed the renal cortical expressions of FcRn and PRR. Aliskiren also reduced the glomerular IgG depositions and the urinary IgG levels albeit with increased circulating serum IgG levels. Conclusion: These results suggest that suppression of FcRn and PRR and regulation of IgG metabolism may be related to the attenuation of anti-GBM GN by aliskiren. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel</P>"

The transforming growth factor ${\beta}1$ (TGF-${\beta}1$)-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is thought to be a possible source of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts in IPF lungs. We have previously reported that apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) has anti-fibrotic activity in experimental lung fibrosis. In this study, we determine whether ApoA1 modulates TGF-${\beta}1$-induced EMT in experimental lung fibrosis and clarify its mechanism of action. Methods: The A549 alveolar epithelial cell line was treated with TGF-${\beta}1$ with or without ApoA1. Morphological changes and expression of EMT-related markers, including E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and ${\alpha}$-smooth muscle actin were evaluated. Expressions of Smad and non-Smad mediators and TGF-${\beta}1$ receptor type 1 ($T{\beta}RI$) and type 2 ($T{\beta}RII$) were measured. The silica-induced lung fibrosis model was established using ApoA1 overexpressing transgenic mice. Results: TGF-${\beta}1$-treated A549 cells were changed to the mesenchymal morphology with less E-cadherin and more N-cadherin expression. The addition of ApoA1 inhibited the TGF-${\beta}1$-induced change of the EMT phenotype. ApoA1 inhibited the TGF-${\beta}1$-induced increase in the phosphorylation of Smad2 and 3 as well as that of ERK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase mediators. In addition, ApoA1 reduced the TGF-${\beta}1$-induced increase in $T{\beta}RI$ and $T{\beta}RII$ expression. In a mouse model of silica-induced lung fibrosis, ApoA1 overexpression reduced the silica-mediated effects, which were increased N-cadherin and decreased E-cadherin expression in the alveolar epithelium. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that ApoA1 inhibits TGF-${\beta}1$-induced EMT in experimental lung fibrosis."

An assumed model feedforward FSMC was designed to avoid tedious identification procedures for the manipulator parameters and to obtain a fast response time. Two constraint switching control functions based on the tracking error and finite-time sliding surface were added to the FSMC to guarantee the predefined tracking performance despite the presence of an unknown deadzone and disturbance. The tracking error due to the deadzone and disturbance can be suppressed within the predefined error boundary simply by tuning the gain value of the constraint switching function and without the addition of an extra compensator. Therefore, the designed constraint controller has a simpler structure than conventional transformed error constraint methods and the sliding surface constraint scheme can also indirectly guarantee the tracking error constraint while being more stable than the tracking error constraint control.

Hence it is needed for venture firms to have more absorptive capacity in order to cope with the environmental change. Absorptive capacity is considered to be composed of multidimensional components such as explorative capacity, transformative capacity and exploitative capacity.However few studies have been done on the relationship among the absorptive capacity’s dimensions and performance of venture firms. Although customer orientation has a potential to impact on the performance of the venture firm and play a moderating role between the absorptive capacity’s dimensions and performance of venture firms, there are limited number of studies that investigate the moderating role of customer orientation on these relationships. This study explores how the absorptive capacity dimensions affect venture firms’ performance and also verifies the moderating role of customer orientation among absorptive capacity dimensions and venture firms’ performance as well as casual relationship between customer orientation and performance. We proposed research model and set up several hypotheses.

한국교회의 새로운 패러다임으로써 선교적 교회에 대한 연구,2016,"['선교적 교회', '다문화 사회', '가정교회', '다음세대', '비지니스선교', 'Missional Church', 'Multi-cultural Society', 'House Church', 'Next Generation', 'Business as Mission']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Korea is currently rapidly transforming into a multi-cultural society through changes in political, economic, military, educational, religious and cultural factors which factor into larger global change. Such transformations in Korean society are directly and indirectly influencing the church. As a result, internal and external changes in the church call for a new paradigm both theology and ecclesiology. In other words, the Korean church must seek out a new model that could transform both the old and new generations. The situation in Korean society requires such a change. When one examines its history, the Korean church has been on a downhill slide since 1995, and today, the church has become noticeably weakened. In addition, evidence shows that the public shows the least amount of trust, average positive feelings towards Christianity relative to other religions, and the church exercised the lowest amount of influence. On the other hand, research also shows that the church performs the most amount of community service. Firstly, it is necessary to take a look at the characteristics of the social changes that call for the transformation of the church into a more missional paradigm. The first characteristic of Korea’s cultural change that is relevant to missional ecclesiology is that Korea is quickly becoming a multi-cultural society. Secondly, the Korean youth are becoming what experts call the Sampo Generation (the generation that gave up 3 things that make one an adult; dating, marriage, and having children) or the Chilpo Generation (the generation that gave up 7 things; dating, marriage, having children, buying a home, human relations, one``s dream and even hope). Thirdly, Korea is going through serious levels of aging. Lastly, we have entered an age of change with regards of competition amongst corporations and management. In short, the nations in the middle of rapid transformation, and because all these social changes are progressing at such a rapid pace, the church is showing difficulty in keeping up. The resulting reality is churches whose influence on society has been deteriorating and a growing number of young men and women that lose interest and leave their respective communities. In order to fulfill the Great Commission, the church must take up its calling for mission, and in order to do so, the church must be reformed into a new missional ecclesiology which is capable of bringing about change, and embraces the new era. Then what must this new missional ecclesiological paradigm look like? The Korean church must first be a community that is centered round love and God, that keeps worship service, evangelizes to prospective customers, continues onto the next generation, is a communal church which is rooted in the domestic church, which focuses on BAM (Business as Mission), reforms multi-cultural society, and makes disciples of all nations. The reason why we cannot see fruit despite knowing all the principles of the missional church and we put them into action is because we have not been properly trained and educated. Therefore, the Korean church must put heavy emphasis on action and put more effort into training and education for missional theology, missional ecclesiology and a missional ministry."

Cinematizing pansori editorial 『Chunhyangjeon』is extra work because the movie reconstructs the past event and at the same time, it should not give up communicating with the present. In terms of the reconstruction of the past, < ChunHyang > can be seen as a great success. Rebuilding the past in present perspectives is impossible in the abstractive approach. To do so, it should proceed to comprehend the classical narratives and thoroughly understand modern media as a reinvention of classical narratives. < ChunHyang > discovered contexts of classical narratives which are appropriate for the movie media and applied various film languages that correspond with the contexts. In this aspect of < Chunhyang >, the movie is highly likely to be the model case of the modernization of classics. However, < Chunhyang > had its limits in terms of communication with the present. < ChunHyang > is the outcome of the director Gwontaek Im``s enthusiasm to reproduce the ``savor of sound`` of pansori and to deliver it to the audience today, even to the audience overseas. It coincides with the just which asserts globalization of most Korean heritage. However, it was director Im``s overenthusiasm. < ChunHyang >, despite its accomplishment, turns traditional art into the subject which needs to be learned and taught. With the interference of function of the textbook and its didactic attitude, audiences today are restricted not to actively enjoy traditional art. The interests observed in the academic field towards the classical narratives are related to the crisis emerged in the field of classic literature. Classical narratives are seen as the subject to learn, not as the art to relish to the audience nowadays. < ChunHyang >, which put textbook duty to itself with the intention of communicating with the audience, became the model of creative reinvention of 『Chunhyangjeon』``s living, breathing cinematic self-consciousness, but also, turned into the subject for learning. Reinvention to overcome the crisis regressed itself to the very cause that called for the predicament."
apolipoprotein a1 inhibits tgf-β1–induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of alveolar epithelial cells,2016,"['Apolipoprotein A-1', 'Transforming Growth Factor Beta1', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Background: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and lethal lung disease characterized by the accumulation of excessive fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in the extracellular matrix. The transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1)–induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is thought to be a possible source of fibroblasts/ myofibroblasts in IPF lungs. We have previously reported that apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) has anti-fibrotic activity in experimental lung fibrosis. In this study, we determine whether ApoA1 modulates TGF-β1–induced EMT in experimental lung fibrosis and clarify its mechanism of action.Methods: The A549 alveolar epithelial cell line was treated with TGF-β1 with or without ApoA1. Morphological changes and expression of EMT-related markers, including E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and α-smooth muscle actin were evaluated. Expressions of Smad and non-Smad mediators and TGF-β1 receptor type 1 (TβRI) and type 2 (TβRII) were measured. The silica-induced lung fibrosis model was established using ApoA1 overexpressing transgenic mice.Results: TGF-β1–treated A549 cells were changed to the mesenchymal morphology with less E-cadherin and more N-cadherin expression. The addition of ApoA1 inhibited the TGF-β1–induced change of the EMT phenotype. ApoA1 inhibited the TGF-β1–induced increase in the phosphorylation of Smad2 and 3 as well as that of ERK and p38 mitogenactivated protein kinase mediators. In addition, ApoA1 reduced the TGF-β1–induced increase in TβRI and TβRII expression. In a mouse model of silica-induced lung fibrosis, ApoA1 overexpression reduced the silica-mediated effects, which were increased N-cadherin and decreased E-cadherin expression in the alveolar epithelium.Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that ApoA1 inhibits TGF-β1–induced EMT in experimental lung fibrosis."

In case of need, BASF brought up its necessary scientific-technological research performance from the outside researchers and institutes, and then it has made its own and completed its task.In comparison of formerly cost and effort of R&D and production in chemical industry, its related charge on the synthetic indigo was enormous. For the sake of its necessary capital, BASF has increased its share capital, and then to retrieve investment costs and to restrict competition formed the dye cartel among german dye companies.From those days of the development and production of indigo, a cutthroat competition among german dye companies has been intensified and its dyes have been excessively produced, german dye companies entered into a pharmaceutical industry and BASF selected the nitrogen fixation process for new profit sources.As BASF has completed the Haber-Bosch Process, BASF has set a good precedent in which modern company sought to its profit sources of the future and its related research originated in laboratory of physical chemistry or inorganic chemistry in university. It may be fairly said that Haber-Bosch process was a model of an industrial-educational cooperation.Above all the processes, the Haber-Bosch Process was the capital-intensive process. For the reason, BASF and Carl Bosch would build up the large scale facilities, and then acquired its intended consequences. Its large scale facilities in which operated a large amount of gas under the high temperature and the high pressure, demanded to the chemical engineers on the new solutions and contributed to the manufacture of improved steels, valves of the new design and enhanced pressure devices.BASF and Bosch's endeavors come into the line with the establishment of the chemical engineering that originated in USA and then re-imported into Europe. Hereafter the union of the chemistry and engineering became the character of the modern industry."

Second, a character classifier is trained by using gradient features. The classifier not only eliminates non-character components but also remains a large number of characters. Third, an effective extractor called the Character Color Transform combines color information of characters and geometry features. It is used to extract potential characters which are not correctly extracted in previous steps. Fourth, a Convolutional Neural Network model is used to verify text candidates, improving the performance of text detection. The proposed technique is tested on two public datasets, i.e., ICDAR2011 dataset and ICDAR2013 dataset. The experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance."

Fault detection is utilized to determine whether a problem has occurred within a certain channel or area of operation. Fault detection and diagnosis have become increasingly important for many technical processes in the development of safe and efficient advanced systems for supervision. This paper presents an integrated technique for fault diagnosis and classification for open- and short-circuit faults in three-phase inverter circuits. Discrete wavelet transform and principal component analysis are utilized to detect the discontinuity in currents caused by a fault. The features of fault diagnosis are then extracted. A fault dictionary is used to acquire details about transistor faults and the corresponding fault identification. Fault classification is performed with a fuzzy logic system and relevance vector machine (RVM). The proposed model is incorporated with a set of optimization techniques, namely, evolutionary particle swarm optimization (EPSO) and cuckoo search optimization (CSO), to improve fault detection. The combination of optimization techniques with classification techniques is analyzed. Experimental results confirm that the combination of CSO with RVM yields better results than the combinations of CSO with fuzzy logic system, EPSO with RVM, and EPSO with fuzzy logic system."

For safe and reliable operation of an electrical drive system, faults in power electronic switches must be detected by an efficient system that is capable of identifying the type of faults. In this paper, an open switch fault identification technique for a three-phase inverter is presented. Single, double, and triple switching faults can be diagnosed using this method. The detection mechanism is based on stator current analysis. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) using Daubechies is performed on the Clarke transformed (-) stator current and features are extracted from the wavelets. An artificial neural network is then used for the detection and identification of faults. To prove the feasibility of this method, a Simulink model of the DWT-based feature extraction scheme using a neural network for the proposed fault detection system in a three-phase inverter with an induction motor is briefly discussed with simulation results. The simulation results show that the designed system can detect faults quite efficiently, with the ability to differentiate between single and multiple switching faults."

An analysis and calculation of the transient current when the RSC is switched off are of significance for carrying out the low voltage ride through (LVRT) of a DFIG. The mathematical derivation is highlighted in this paper. The zero-state and zero-input responses of the transient current in the frequency domain through a Laplace transformation are investigated, and the transient components in the time domain are achieved. With the characteristics worked out from the linear resolving without modeling simplification, the selection of the resistance in the linear crowbar circuit and the value conversion from a linear circuit to a nonlinear one is proposed to setup the attenuation rate. In terms of grid code requirements, the theoretical analysis for the time constant of the transient components attenuation insures the controllability when the excitation of the RSC is resumed and it guarantees the reserved time for the response of the reactive power compensation. Simulations are executed in MATLAB/SIMPOWER and experiments are carried out to validate the theoretical analysis. They indicate that the calculation method is effective for selection of the resistance in a crowbar circuit for LVRT operations."

Here we offer a nutrition-based adjuvant therapy for liver fibrosis, a major risk factor for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Aim of the study: To evaluate the possible hepatoprotective effects of Jerusalem artichoke tubers (JAT) in combination with interferon and ribavirin. Materials and Methods: Twelve groups of rats were administered JAT, interferon and ribavirin either separately or in combination from day one of $CCL_4$ administration until the end of the study. Animals were killed after 8 weeks of $CCL_4$-induced hepatotoxicity. Results: Hepatocytes from rats treated with triple combination of interferon, ribavirin, and JAT showed more less normal architecture compared to $CCL_4$-treated rats. We also detected significantly higher hepatic protein expression levels of p53, BAX and transforming growth factor-${\beta}$ (TGF-${\beta}$) in the $CCL_4$-intoxicated group compared to normal controls, as evidenced by immunohistochemical staining and western blotting analyses. Addition of JAT as a supportive regimen improved response to ribavirin and interferon and effectively participated in retaining normal histopathological and biochemical criteria and significantly lowered protein expression of p53, BAX, and TGF-${\beta}$. Conclusions: We suggest that addition of JAT as a supportive r egimen to interferon and ribavirin effectively potentiates their anti-fibrotic effects."

The Eringen’s nonlocal elasticity theory takes into account the effect of small size while the Gurtin- Murdoch model is used to incorporate the surface effects (SE). The derived governing differential equations are solved by DTM which demonstrated to have high precision and computational efficiency in the vibration analysis of nanobeams. The detailed mathematical derivations are presented and numerical investigations are performed while the emphasis is placed on investigating the effect of thermal loading, small scale and surface effects, mode number, thickness ratio and boundary conditions on the normalized natural frequencies and critical buckling loads of the nanobeams in detail. The results show that the surface effects lead to an increase in natural frequency and critical buckling load of nanotubes. It is explicitly shown that the vibration and buckling of a nanotube is significantly influenced by these effects and the influence of thermal loadings and nonlocal effects are minimal."
using generalized weighted minimum entropy deconvolution algorithm to improve the resolution of ultrasonic guided wave testing,2016,"['Ultrasonic Guided Wave', 'Deconvolution', 'Resolution', 'Weighted Nonlinear Transformation']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Ultrasonic guided wave detection technology has numerous advantages compared with body waves. Accurately obtaining the time-of-arrival (TOA) or time-of-flight (TOF) of the ultrasonic guided wave signal is critical for the detection and location of defect because of the frequent use of the low frequency guided wave probe in testing. Thus, guaranteeing the propagation over a long distance and increasing the resolution of defect detection become the key points. This study adds the weighted nonlinear transformation functions to the minimum entropy deconvolution (MED). By adjusting the corresponding parameters, it can enhance a weak signal of small defects and suppress the noise signal. The experimental results indicate that this method can accurately obtain TOA to enhance the resolution of defect detection and can improve the speed of convergence effectively compared with MED."

The proposed UAV was designed to provide both hovering and fixed-wing type aerodynamic flight modes. The UAV’s flight mode transition was achieved through the attitude transformation in pitch axis, which avoids a complex rotor tilt mechanism from a structural and control viewpoint. To achieve this, a different navigation coordinate was introduced that avoids the gimbal lock in pitch singularity point. Attitude and guidance control algorithms were developed for the flight control system. For flight test purposes, a quadrotor attached with a tailless fixed-wing structure was manufactured. An onboard flight control computer was designed to realize the navigation and control algorithms and the UAV’s performance was verified through the outdoor flight tests."

Combined via network, these service resources can provide value-added ubiquitous services anywhere at anytime. In a future ubiquitous network, it is expected to achieve an adaptive service platform, which can dynamically integrate various service resources to provide adaptive and context-aware services. This paper presents a new service registry platform named UBI-REGI, which is used to support efficient and dynamic discovery of service resources in a ubiquitous network. To define the scope of operation within the real world and IT world， UBI-REGI divides every service operation into three categories: source service, transformation service and sink service. Furthermore, UBI-REGI specifies meta-data like physical location or device owner to manage physical devices, in addition to the conventional meta-data like service name, purpose and description. In order to enable UBI-REGI to be easily used by external program, this paper designs and implements UBI-REGI API by using Web service technologies. With this API, external applications can find service resources by queries of service category, location, purpose keywords， and so on. As a case study, this paper demonstrates an environment continue service in a home network system to prove the feasibility of this proposal."

Software companies need to employ these methods to overcome the inherent challenges of traditional methods. However, transitioning to Agile approach is a topic of debate and there is no unique and well-defined transition model or framework yet. Although some research studies have addressed barriers and strengths behind the successful Agile deployment, it seems that this process still needs to be studied more in depth. The rationale behind this is the socio-technical nature of Agile transition and adoption. Particularly, the challenges and problems that software companies are facing during Agile transition, show that this process in more difficult than expected. Conducting a large-scale research study revealed that Agile transition and adoption process needs to be supported by several critical prerequisites. This study adopted a Ground Theory with the participation of 49 Agile experts from 13 different countries and empirically identified seven transition prerequisites. These prerequisites focus on the different aspects of the transition. The main aim of this paper is proposing these prerequisites and theoretical and practical implication of these prerequisites. Providing these prerequisites before moving to Agile increases chance of success in Agile transition and adoption and leads to fewer challenges during the change process."

Before CTT test, Particle flow code was used for the determination of the standard dimension of physical samples. Four numerical models with different dimensions were made and were subjected to tensile loading. The geometry of the model with ideal failure pattern was selected for physical sample preparation. A concrete slab with dimensions of 15×19×6 cm and a hole at its center was prepared and subjected to tensile loading using this special loading device. The ratio of hole diameter to sample width was 0.5. The samples were made from a mixture of water, fine sand and cement with a ratio of 1-0.5-1, respectively. A 30-ton hydraulic jack with a load cell applied compressive loading to CTT with the compressive pressure rate of 0.02 MPa per second. The compressive loading was converted to tensile stress on the sample because of the overall test design. A numerical modeling was also done to analyze the effect of the hole diameter on stress concentrations of the hole side along its horizontal axis to provide a suitable criterion for determining the real tensile strength of concrete. Concurrent with indirect tensile test, the Brazilian test was performed to compare the results from two methods and also to perform numerical calibration. The numerical modeling shows that the models have tensile failure in the sides of the hole along the horizontal axis before any failure under shear loading. Also the stress concentration at the edge of the hole was 1.4 times more than the applied stress registered by the machine. Experimental Results showed that, the indirect tensile strength was clearly lower than the Brazilian test strength."

We aim to the minimum the transmit power of relays, satisfying the SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) of the secondary users high a threshold and keeping the interference at primary users below an acceptable threshold. Because of the robust identity the optimal problem is a non-convex problem which is hard to be solved. In this paper we transform the non-convex problem into a convex one which can be solved efficiently by exploiting S-procedure and Schur complement theorem and relaxing the rank-one constrain. Then the robust beamforming vector can be obtained. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can solve the minimum problem with robust features efficiently and obtain satisfactory results."

We call this D2D SINR improvement algorithm as DSIA, and design it from the perspective of precoding and decoding. With the DSIA, each D2D pair involved in the network can obtain the corresponding precoding and decoding vectors which make the SINR of its receiver being maximized. In order to clearly describe the design procedure of the proposed algorithm, we first formulate an optimization problem with multiple variables to maximize the SINR of each D2D receiver, then simplify the objective function through mathematical derivation and seek out the relationship between the optimized variables which can transform the optimization problem to one of solving nonlinear equations, and finally propose the DSIA to work out the nonlinear equations. Numerical results show that the DSIA will enable D2D to achieve significant performance gains in terms of SINR and bit-error rate (BER) compared with the traditional spectrum orthogonal scheme."

alpha lipoic acid inhibits proliferation and epithelial mesenchymal transition of thyroid cancer cells,2016,"['Alpha lipoic acid', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition', 'Transforming growth factor beta']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The naturally occurring short-chain fatty acid, alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a powerful antioxidant which is clinically used for treatment of diabetic neuropathy. Recent studies suggested the possibility of ALA as a potential anti-cancer agent, because it could activate adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibit transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) pathway. In this study, we evaluate the effects of ALA on thyroid cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. We performed in vitro cell proliferation analysis using BCPAP, HTH-83, CAL-62 and FTC-133 cells. ALA suppressed thyroid cancer cell proliferation through activation of AMPK and subsequent down-regulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-S6 signaling pathway. Low-dose ALA, which had minimal effects on cell proliferation, also decreased cell migration and invasion of BCPAP, CAL-62 and HTH-83 cells. ALA inhibited epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) evidently by increase of E-cadherin and decreases of activated p-catenin, vimentin, snail, and twist in these cells. ALA suppressed TGF beta production and inhibited induction of pSmad2 and twist by TGF beta 1 or TGF beta 2. These findings indicate that ALA reduces cancer cell migration and invasion through suppression of TGF beta production and inhibition of TGF beta signaling pathways in thyroid cancer cells. ALA also significantly suppressed tumor growth in mouse xenograft model using BCPAP and FTC-133 cells. This is the first study to show anti-cancer effect of ALA on thyroid cancer cells. ALA could be a potential therapeutic agent for treatment of advanced thyroid cancer, possibly as an adjuvant therapy with other systemic therapeutic agents. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Wireless vibration sensor nodes are utilized to measure accelerations from the deck, pylon and stay cables of the bridge. Secondly, dynamic responses of the cable-stayed bridge under the attack of two consecutive typhoons, Bolaven and Tembin, are analyzed under various wind speeds. Stochastic subspace identification method and short-time Fourier transform analysis are selected to examine wind-induced variations of the bridge's responses based on the field measurements under the two typhoons. Finally, the structural identification of the bridge is performed under various wind velocities to examine the typhoon-induced variations of the bridge's structural properties. The variations of dynamic characteristics due to the typhoons are turned into the changes of the bridge's stiffness (or flexibility) via the fine-tuning process."

In the past, the address space transformation algorithm, invented from the research about the real-time text editing system, could maintain consistency among more sites. The Multi Version conflict resolution approach could preserve users’ intentions but not all when conflicts occur. This paper proposes a new solution of conflict resolution, named Intention Combination Conflict Resolution strategy with the document model of AST based on the idea of Multi Version approach. This solution can not only preserve all users’ editing consistency by intention combination, but also keep all versions of operational objects including conflict operations’ combination effects. In addition, the effectiveness of related algorithms is analyzed, and the availability of the strategy is described by a case and proved by our experiment."

The PVDF/PEO blends were prepared from solution in the whole composition range. Isothermal and non-isothermal experiments were carried out using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Since the components of the blend crystallize separately due to high difference of the melting points, the changes in melting, crystallization, and equilibrium melting temperatures of PVDF and PEO as well as the degree of crystallization were evaluated. As the binary blends display an asymmetric lower critical solution temperature (LCST)-type phase diagram, the crystallization behavior and kinetics were strongly affected by the miscibility state of the blends in the melt. Particularly, the overall crystallization of PEO was accelerated in the blends with high level of PEO (>50 wt%) by two different mechanisms. The formation of phase separated domains at this composition range enhanced the nucleation ability due to the “spinodal decomposition/ interface assisted crystallization”. Moreover, presence of preexisting crystals of PVDF could act as a substrate for PEO crystallization and increased the crystallization growth rate. Wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were also utilized to study the crystalline polymorphism of PVDF and PEO in the blends."

Freud, der in Wien seine wissenschaftliche Bahn annahm, war als Sohn seiner Zeit der Meinung, zwischen Psychologie und Neurobiologie vermitteln zu konnen.

헌정주의와 사회국가,2016,"['Constitutionalism', 'welfare state', 'social state', 'consensus democracy', 'welfare rights']","이 글의 목적은 그 동안 권력구조를 중심으로 전개된 헌법개정의 인식 틀을 확장하여 복지국가모델의 기본 틀과 그 형성과정을 하나의 ‘공론장’으로 삼는 학문적 필요성을 제기하는 데 있다. 특히 헌정주의를 통한 복지정치의 활성화는 헌법규범의 안정성을 재생산하는 것이 아니라, 다양한 헌법해석의 사회적 실천이고, 이는 시민들의 참여, 의회정치, 정당 경쟁으로 확보된다는 점에 주목한다. 이 글에서 사용하는 사회국가의 개념은 ‘시장 및 사회관계에 대한 개입조정을 통해 국가공동체 구성원에게 적절한 생활기준(standard of living)을 제공하고, 차별에 의한 생활상의 불평등을 조정하고 사회적 균등을 확보할 수 있도록 실질적인 자유와 민주주의를 증진하는 국가체제’다. 이러한 정의에 따라, 먼저 독일의 사회국가 논쟁을 통해 헌법해석과 헌법의 실천이 왜 중요하게 제기되었는가를 검토하고, 합의형 민주주의체제 속에서 의회와 정당을 중심으로 한 입법실천을 통해 복지기본권을 확장해 갔던 북유럽 복지국가의 정치를 분석했다. 국가체제는 정부형태는 물론이고, 선거제도, 그리고 국가와 사회관계를 총괄한다는 의미에서 헌정주의적 개념이기도 하다. 이러한 의미에서 헌법개정은 헌법해석과 헌법실천이 복합적으로 상호작용하는 사회적 공론화의 결과인 것이다. 요컨대 복지국가에서 헌법을 매개로한 사회국가로, 헌법이 규정한 정치체제의 한계와 복지국가에 대한 기능적 이해에서 벗어나 기본권에 대한 적극적 실천의 담지자로서 사회국가가 정부, 의회, 시민사회의 갈등과 협력의 과정을 통해 지속가능할 수 있도록 합의형 민주주의제도로 정치체제를 개편하는 것이 기본권에 대한 헌법해석의 사회화와 함께 병행되어야 한다.","The aim of this article is to suggest the scholarly necessity of the value of the welfare state in order to broaden the framework and the field of the public sphere for a state model beyond debating on the form of government. This article will pay especially close attention to the activation of welfare politics through constitutionalism that can be achieved by not reproducing the status quo in self-completed systems, but various social practices about constitutional interpretation based on popular participation, parliamentarism and party competition.  In my view, the definition of the social state is that the state system provides the proper standard of living, resolves inequality by discrimination, and improves substantial freedom and democracy to obtain social equity for members in the community. According to this concept, I identified the importance of constitutional interpretation and practice by reviewing the debate on the social state in Germany. And in the case of Nordic welfare states, it could have been improved welfare rights through legislation by the parliament and political parties on the consensual democracy.  The state system is a constitutional concept as well as a form of government in the meaning of including electoral system and the relationship between the state and society. In this sense, constitutional reform should result in public issues, interaction of constitutional interpretation, and constitutional practice beyond the gap between the norm and practice.  In conclusion, to pursue socialization for the deepening of constitutional basic rights, it is necessary that reforms to the consensus democracy consolidate a sustainable democratic social state as an active protector that transforms the welfare state democratically in process of the coordinating government, parliament, and civil society to overcome the functional understanding of the welfare state under the current constitution."

We make intensive inquiries into this issue via casestudies on two sectors in Taiwan, namely the bicycle industry and the electric vehicle (EV)industry. Our conceptual framework gives special account to fuzzy front-end at theindustrial level and how market cultivation and innovative business models come to play animportant role in shaping the innovation path for post catch-up. For leading players inTaiwan’s bicycle industry, a key issue they faced was how to transform themselves andlocal setting in Taiwan to become a leader in high-end bicycles to fend off escalatedinternational competition. In the emerging EV industry, the Taiwanese players try toovercome its structural weaknesses in the mainstream automotive industry to explore thepossibility of levelling the playing field with the forerunners in the advanced countries. Ourcase studies suggest that technological catch-up is not necessarily a prelude to post catch-up,depending on the nature of new innovation trajectory and entry modes of the emergingindustry. Our analyses also lend support to the importance of product servicising as a meansof post catch-up, especially from the perspective of market cultivation."

Coal gasification provides a wide range of products such as chemical, power, liquid, and gaseous fuels. A simulation study was undertaken to calculate the composition, mass flow rate, temperature, pressure of syngas, ash slag layer thickness, heat dissipation from the reactor, and carbon conversion of the coal under steady state conditions. The effect of changes in the input parameters such as the changes in the O<SUB>2</SUB> and H<SUB>2</SUB>O to coal ratios, operating temperature, and most importantly the change in the fuel, was considered. Besides steady state simulations, dynamic simulations were also conducted to predict the starting and shutdown conditions of the gasifier. The g-proms process modeling software was utilized to conduct the simulations based on mathematical equations, which are capable of calculating time dependent derivatives. In order to obtain the actual physical and chemical properties of coal and its ash, as well as the reaction kinetics of coal, some experiments were performed. Proximate analysis, elemental analysis, and coal pyrolysis, combustion and gasification kinetics were conducted using thermogravimetry (TGA), elemental analysis method (EA), and a pressurized wire mesh heating reactor (PWMR), respectively. Ash viscosity and ash mineral composition were determined using rheometer and X-ray fluorescence (XRF), respectively. The results of these experiments were fitted into the model and served as input for the calculations. Berau and Kideco are low rank Indonesian coals with different characteristics.

in-situ blockage monitoring of sensing line,2016,"['Approximations', 'Blockages', 'Details', 'Pressure Transmitter', 'Sensing Line', 'Wavelet Transform']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"A reactor vessel level monitoring system measures the water level in a reactor during normal operation and abnormal conditions. A drop in the water level can expose nuclear fuel, which may lead to fuel meltdown and radiation spread in accident conditions. A level monitoring system mainly consists of a sensing line and pressure transmitter. Over a period of time boron sediments or other impurities can clog the line which may degrade the accuracy of the monitoring system. The aim of this study is to determine blockage in a sensing line using the energy of the composite signal. An equivalent Pi circuit model is used to simulate blockages in the sensing line and the system's response is examined under different blockage levels. Composite signals obtained from the model and plant's unblocked and blocked channels are decomposed into six levels of details and approximations using a wavelet filter bank. The percentage of energy is calculated at each level for approximations. It is observed that the percentage of energy reduces as the blockage level in the sensing line increases. The results of the model and operational data are well correlated. Thus, in our opinion variation in the energy levels of approximations can be used as an index to determine the presence and degree of blockage in a sensing line."

Present study applied several different modal decomposition methods to derive the damping ratio of different modes. The modal decomposition methods considered in this study are simple band-pass filter, Hilbert vibration decomposition, Wavelet transform and proper orthogonal decomposition.

The labor reform, the U.S. military government implemented in Korea and Japan, aimed to establish economic unionism, which modeled the U.S.`s Wagner Act. However, due to the advent of the Cold War, the achievement of labor reform failed. As a result, several labor bodies lost political power in post-war South Korea and Japan. The reports on the labor policies of the U.S. military government illustrates several areas in the original plan which caused their loss of influence. While suspect of communists ensconced within labor union, the drafters of labor reports did not dispense with their original plan of establishing a democratic labor union. However, the labor reform policies were delayed due to confrontation with the Soviet Union, ultimately leading to the purging of communists. This Cold War transformation was more radical in Korea than in Japan. First, lack of information and institutions or agents for governing caused the transformation in the case of Korea. In Korea, all powers were concentrated in the hands of the commander, John R. Hodge. Second, the style and governing methods by way of alternative political forces worsened the degree of conflict in Korea as opposed to conflict in Japan.

Typical Transaction Cost Analysis theory explains that when transaction cost with business channels(whether it is for buy or sell) increase, the firms integrate the channels. So it is a choice made by firms regarding direct versus indirect channels. The theory was extended to a model of choice of institutional form of direct or indirect export by a norm of opportunism in this empirical study. The survey result showed that lower level of asset specificity and marketing capability or higher level of environmental uncertainty were likely to expose indirect exporters to higher level of opportunism of direct exporter. And we also saw that indirect exporters were likely to choose direct export chanel when opportunism of exporters was higher. From the standpoint of theory, we can say that the basic propositions of the Transaction Cost Analysis, except the attribute of frequency, are supported. This study result could provide a profiling of target business areas and firms for government’s policy on direct export promotion of SMEs."

At constant stresses at -45 degrees C, the alloy exhibits pronounced creep up to 0.6% at 600 MPa after only 30 min holding time. If the strain is kept constant, a pronounced stress relaxation of up to 10% of the initial stress was observed. The final creep strains, the creep rates at a constant stress as well as the stress relaxation at a constant strain increase with decreasing temperature. In addition, the change of the recovery stress as a function of time in a restrained sample after 4% elongation and heating to different constant temperatures was monitored. It was observed that the increase of the final recovery stress is more pronounced when the holding temperature is increased. This behavior was explained with the time and temperature dependent formation of stress induced epsilon-martensite from the parent gamma-austenite phase during mechanical loading according to the model of Kajiwara et al. as well as with the increased number of stacking faults at lower temperatures, which serve as nucleation sites for the epsilon-martensite formation.

Deconvolution of the specific range of FT-IR spectra into contributing peaks allowed the quantitative tracking of the stabilization reaction by electron beam irradiation.
통일 과정에서 농업협동조합 고찰,2016,"['협동조합', '독일통일', '북한경제', 'Cooperative', 'die deutsche Vereinigung', 'nordkoreanische Wirtschaft']","한반도가 어떤 형태로 통일을 이룰지 우리 모두 아직 알 수 없다. 첫 번째 시나리오는 연방 형태의 통일을 골자로 하는 6·15 남북 공동선언 (2000년)을 기반으로 한다. 이보다 앞서 1980년 10월 김일성 전 주석은 남북한 체제가 공존해야 한다는 제안을 하였다. 남북 공동선언은 북한에 여전히 유효하며 북한은 독일 통일 모델을 한국에 적용할 것을 최근에도 재차 거부했다. 이러한 이유로 강연 첫 파트에선 통일 과정에서 북한 경제 체제와 농업협동조합이 유지한다는 전제 하에 동 주제를 다루겠다. 두 번째 시나리오는 독일 통일과정에서 구동독 농업생산조합의 구서독 협동조합법에 따른 조정과정을 고찰하겠다. 통일 후 무엇보다 두 가지 측면에서 개선이 필요했다. 하나는 농업생산조합을 단순히 등록 협동조합으로 전환하는 것은 조합을 효율성이 높은 기업으로 구조조정하기엔 충분하지 않았다는 점이다. 따라서 협동조합을 합자회사 및 자본회사로 전환하는 것이 추가적으로 허용되었다. 두 번째로 농업생산조합 후속기업에 남은 조합원과 보상금을 받고 조합을 탈퇴한 회원 간 이해관계 충돌로 탈퇴 회원이 적은 액수의 보상금만을 받는 일이 발생했다. 이로 인해 탈퇴 회원에 대한 보상금 규정이 점점 구체화되었다. 이와 같은 모든 조치에도 불구하고 농업생산조합을 독일 연방공화국 법으로 통합하는 과정에서 많은 문제가 발생했으며 동 조치도 이를 막지 못했다. 특히 조합 전환과 재산 문제를 다룰 때 재차 문제점이 나타났다. 따라서 한국이 독일을 선례로 통일을 할 경우, 1989년과 1990년 당시 독일 입법자들보다 농업협동조합 법에 대한 대비를 더 철저히 해야 한다.","Die heutige Tagung ist Rechtsfragen einer Wiedervereinigung auf der koreanischen Halbinsel gewidmet. In welcher Form diese Wiedervereinigung vollzogen werden wird, wissen wir heute noch nicht. Deshalb möchte ich im folgenden mein Thema auf der Grundlage zweier unterschiedlicher Szenarien behandeln. Das erste Szenario fußt auf der June 15th North-South Joint Declaration (2000), die von einer Wiedervereinigung in der Form einer Konföderation – so die Vorstellung des Südens – bzw. von einer losen Föderation – so der Vorschlag des Nordens – spricht, wobei nach dem Vorschlag Kim Il Sungs vom Oktober 1980 die Gesellschaftssysteme beider Teile Koreas koexistieren sollten. Diese Declaration ist aus nordkoreanischer Sicht immer noch aktuell. Der nordkoreanische Außenminister Ri Su Yong hat auf der UNO-Vollversammlung am 27.9.2014 eine Konföderation mit zwei Systemen in einem Land angeregt. In seiner Neujahrsansprache 2016 hat Marschall (Wonsu) Kim Jong Un einer Veränderung des Systems in Nordkorea und einer einseitigen Systemvereinigung eine Absage erteilt. Erst kürzlich wieder hat Nordkorea das Modell der Wiedervereinigung Deutschlands für Korea abgelehnt. Darum empfehlen auch in Südkorea manche Wissenschaftler, das politische Vorgehen zunächst auf der Basis einer low-level confederation der beiden Koreas statt auf der Grundlage einer vielleicht erst später möglichen vollständigen Wiedervereinigung zu planen. Deshalb gehe ich im ersten Teil meines Vortrags von einem Fortbestand des nordkoreanischen Wirtschaftssystems und seiner landwirtschaftlichen Genossenschaften in einem Wiedervereinigungsprozess aus. Dieser erste Teil meiner Präsentation fußt auf einem Vortrag, den ich im September 2014 an der Kim Il Sung-Universität in Pyongyang gehalten habe und der in einem Publikationsorgan der Kim Il Sung-Universität veröffentlicht werden wird. Als zweites Szenario soll die Wiedervereinigung Deutschlands dienen, bei welcher die ostdeutschen Landwirtschaftlichen Produktionsgenossenschaften in das westdeutsche Genossenschafts- bzw. Gesellschaftsrecht eingepasst worden sind."
point stabilization of full-actuated autonomous underwater vehicle in polar coordinates,2016,"['autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)', 'point stabilization', 'polar coordinates', 'Lyapunov function', 'backstepping']",국문 초록 정보 없음,It is addressed that the point stabilization of the full-actuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The system model is established in polar coordinates and the designing methods of kinematic controller are obtained. The polar coordinates are applied to avoid Brockett’s conditions. The kinematic controller is extended to dynamic controller based on Lyapunov methods and backstepping techniques. The controller is designed to ensure that the full-actuated AUV asymptotically converges to the target point. Simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Combined with fast data processing functions of DSP, the device can quickly and accurately measures electric vehicles charging amounts under different charging modes."
enhanced empirical mode decomposition approach to eliminate motion artifacts in eeg  using ica and dwt,2016,"['EEG', 'EEMD-ICA', 'ICA', 'DWT', 'EEMD-DWICA']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"To ease the concept of diagnosing human health a strong and viable biomedical signal is of importance. Biomedical signal measurement and processing of signal cause the probability of artifacts which can obstruct the features of interest and quality of information available in the signal. So elimination of artifacts from physiological signals is an essential step. The single channel measurement is important when instrumentation complexity is needed to be minimized, in spite of many multichannel signals recording methods available.In this paper, an enhanced empirical approach to remove the artifacts of single channel signal is described followed by filtering mechanism using ICA and DWT. The input EEG is a single channel and is converted into multichannel for ICA operations. The multi-channel EEG signal is filtered with fast ICA algorithmand DWT is employed to reject any traces of artifacts left in the signal. This technique is tested against currently available wavelet de-noising and EMD-ICA technique using functional near infrared spectroscopy (EEG) signal. Artifact removal technique has been evaluated by DSNR, Lambda (λ), Autocorrelation and PSD. The results pronounce the eligibility of proposed algorithm to stand on top of currently deployed algorithms with 12% improvement in DSNR and alsoa significant improvement in different parameters too."

We also demonstrate how this fast economic growth has molded the country`s socio-politico-cultural life and, in doing so at an semi-anthropological and pseudo-ethnographical approach, help readers to better understand the contemporary life style of average South Koreans. The experience of economic growth in South Korea is unprecedented in human history and provides a role model for the design of strategies for economic growth and development, as well as for associated government policies, for recently developing economies. We then show that the economy and society in South Korea provides an example of a living laboratory to understand better both developing and advanced economies. The “growing pain” of fast-growing economies and the “geriatric symptom” of advanced economies coexist in contemporary South Korea."

optimal operation of tri-generation microgrids considering demand uncertainties,2016,"['CCHP microgrids', 'demand uncertainty', 'microgrid operation', 'optimal operation', 'tri-generation microgrid', 'robust optimization']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Tri-generation microgrids, also known as combined cooling, heat and power (CCHP) microgrids, have the potential to suffice the collective thermal and electrical demands of the microgrid residents. However, the energy demand of microgrids cannot be accurately predicted. Therefore, in this paper, robust optimization-based modeling for optimal operation of tri-generation microgrids is proposed. Uncertainty in cooling, heat, and power demands and worst-case realizations of uncertainties are considered. Initially, a deterministic problem is formulated which is then transformed into a min-max robust counterpart. Finally, a tractable robust counterpart is formulated by using the dual of the inner sub-problem. The formulated model is capable of providing feasible solutions for all possible realizations of uncertainties in energy demands (within the uncertainty bounds). The final tractable robust counterpart is simulated in CPLEX and various uncertainty cases are simulated. Simulation results have proved the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed optimization strategy."

Gradually exacerbating poverty and unemployment were problematized as risks to the continuation of the current capitalist regime. As a risk management, it pursued the strategy to integrate the disadvantaged into society by providing them jobs through promoting social enterprises. In this process, the knowledge system of social capital theory served as a guideline through which the social could be used as means for governmental ends. In the governing mechanism of social enterprises promotion, the state took the strategy to form a hierarchical partnership with civic organizations. It transformed the areas of the social into recognizable and governable ones through regular evaluation of each social enterprise’s performance. By monopolizing authority to call an organization ‘social enterprise,’ it led the activities of public good-oriented civic organizations to be conformed to the goal of government. Through coupling social enterprises with big commercial enterprises and promoting Pro Bono campaign, it facilitated knowledge, methods and logic of business administration to be infiltrated into the fabric of social enterprises. The mechanism of the social enterprise promotion in South Korea shows that neoliberal governmentality is not incompatible with the values of communal solidarity, democratic participation of citizens, and social-public orientation. Rather it operates through these values."

However, these approaches often failed to look at the influence of the context on actors as well as the interaction between actors and institution. Accordingly, it introduces theories of the state and policy network and applies those to the case of selecting a radioactive waste management site in South Korea, depending mainly on literature review. The case analysis shows that the Korean government has transformed its strategy from game management to network structuring, because game management strategy is no longer effective when the government loses trust. At the conclusion, it suggests that it is time for Korean bureaucrats to deal with individual actors within the network and to manage the network itself."

In order to accomplish it, the study examines the definition and key principles of critical pedagogy as a best teaching practice, and describes music teaching model developed by Frank Abrahams based on critical pedagogy. Then, this study provides sample music lessons based on Abrahams’ teaching model and suggests the implications of critical music lesson. Critical pedagogy for music education inspires a conversational exchange of information between a music teacher and students and it shifts the power structures in music classroom by acknowledging that students come to class with information gleaned from their own experiences. Also, critical music pedagogy poses and solves questions and problems to students that the pedagogy causes them to take what they already knew and understood from their world outside music classroom and connects it to their educational goals. This breaks down barriers that exist between what students understood outside the classroom and the knowledge their teacher wants them to learn. Throughout this process, students feel empowered by their knowledge and are alerted to plentiful opportunities for meaningful experiences inside and outside the classroom. This leads to change in perception and transforming experience for both students and their teacher."

Pour cette etude, nous avons choisi comme textes d`analyse Le Petit Chaperon Rouge de Charles Perrault et des freres Grimm et quatre publicites qui les parodient. Notre analyse s`appuie sur la theorie semiotique a partir des travaux de Vladimir Propp jusqu`a Algirdas Julien Greimas. Rolf Jensen a souligne l`importance du storytelling en mentionnant ≪nous achetons des emotions aujourdh`hui≫. De nos jours, le conte de fees est souvent transpose dans l`univers de la publicite, d`autant que le storytelling en publicite est plus important que l`image provocante ou l`expression directe du message publicitaire. Le conte de fees est tres utile a etre recree comme publicite du point de vue de son universalite, de sa structure narrative, de ses elements mysterieux et surnaturels, de ses caracteristiques metaphoriques et instructives et de sa liberte de violation du droit d`auteur, etc. Lors de la transformation du conte de fees en publicite, il est d`abord necessaire de choisir un conte auquel l`objectif publicitaire correspond, et ensuite de prendre en compte les facons diverses de la parodie du conte de fees selon les recepteurs publicitaires(audience, consommateur…). Ayant compare le degre de parodie du Petit Chaperon Rouge par les modeles semiotiques que nous avons degages dans quatre publicites, le conte de fees est plus deforme dans la publicite commerciale que dans la publicite visant l`interet public. Et les recepteurs publicitaires sont d`autant plus ages que le conte de fees est plus deforme pour echapper a l`histoire codifiee ; le chaperon rouge n`est plus une victime mais une maltresse douce qui soumet le loup. Le loupe est au contraire neutralise. Pour la parodie efficace, il est capital d`amener le public a voir differemment ce que lui est familier. En fait, l`hypertexte(la publicite) est oblige d`impliquer la difference dans la similitude avec l`hypotexte(le conte de fees) pour sortir du cliche. Les publicitaires doivent donc chercher a integrer la mode contemporaine dans la structure narrative du conte de fees pour s`attirer la sympathie du public et y fondre efficacement des elements pratiques, ludiques et metaphoriques qui sont importants pour le monde de la publicite."
identification of transmission line lightning based on hht,2016,"['Identification of lightning stroke', 'ATP-EMTP', 'HHT']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Lightning groundwire or tower without fault, back striking, shielding failure without fault and shielding failure with fault are simulated and analyzed in this paper based on the electromagnetic transient simulation software of ATP-EMTP. The results show that the current waveform of lightning strikes the ground or tower without fault is generated by the coupling of lighting current from lighting groundwire and oscillates around the axis of the steady state. Back striking contains processes of couple and flashover, its current waveform has characteristics of reverse polarity pulse and sudden current drop. The current of shielding failure without fault is the lighting current. The current waveform of shielding failure with fault is characterized by the truncation. On this basis, the Hilbert Huang transform (HHT) was introduced to do further analysis of the simulation results. The solution of end effect is also proposed in this paper. And thus the marginal spectrum was obtained by dealing with the simulated current waveform of lightning stroke. Then, calculating the energy distribution in different frequency bands and normalizing them. Therefore, a method for recognizing 4 types of lightning stroke is proposed which is on the basis of the energy proportion in different frequency bands. In addition, a large number of simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of this method by changing the parameters of the lightning current, grounding resistance and lightning distance."

To simulate a concrete sewer pipe, a thin concrete plate was built and placed over container filled with sand.The cavity was modeled as an extruded polystyrene foam box. Two sets of tests were performed, one over sand andthe other on cavity. A new impact device was developed to apply a consistent high frequency impact load on the concreteplate, thereby increasing the reliability of the test procedure. The frequency and transient characteristics of the measuredreflected waveforms were analyzed via fast Fourier transform and short time Fourier spectrum. It was shown that theshapes of Fourier spectra are very similar to one another, and therefore cannot be used to predict the presence of cavity.A new index, termed resonance duration, is defined to record the time of vibration exceeding a prescribed intensity.The results showed that the resonance duration is a more effective parameter for predicting the presence of a cavity.A value of the resonance period was proposed to estimate the presence of cavity. Further studies using various soiltypes and field tests are warranted to validate the proposed approach."
fast phase-added stereogram algorithm for generation of photorealistic 3d content,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>A new phase-added stereogram algorithm for accelerated computation of holograms from a point cloud model is proposed. The algorithm relies on the hologram segmentation, sampling of directional information, and usage of the fast Fourier transform with a finer grid in the spatial frequency domain than is provided by the segment size. The algorithm gives improved quality of reconstruction due to new phase compensation introduced in the segment fringe patterns. The result is finer beam steering leading to high peak intensity and a large peak signal-to-noise ratio in reconstruction. The feasibility of the algorithm is checked by the generation of 3D contents for a color wavefront printer. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America</P>"

sloshing design load prediction of a membrane type lng cargo containment system with two-row tank arrangement in offshore applications,2016,"['Sloshing', 'Strength assessment', 'Two row arrangement', 'Cargo containment system', 'GTT NO96']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper addresses the safety of two-row tank design by performing the extensive sloshing model tests. Owing to the uncertainties entangled with the scale law transforming the measured impact pressure up to the full scale one, so called comparative approach was taken to derive the design sloshing load. The target design vessel was chosen as 230 K LNG-FPSO with tow-row tank arrangement and the reference vessel as 138 K conventional LNG carrier, which has past track record without any significant failure due to sloshing loads. Starting with the site-specific metocean data, ship motion analysis was carried out with 3D diffraction-radiation program, then the obtained ship motion data was used as 6DOF tank excitation for subsequent sloshing model test and analysis. The statistical analysis was carried out with obtained peak data and the long-term sloshing load was determined out of it. It was concluded that the normalized sloshing impact pressure on 230 K LNG-FPSO with two-row tank arrangement is higher than that of convectional LNG carrier, hence requires the use of reinforced cargo containment system for the sake of failure-free operation without filling limitation."
dynamic rheological and structural characterization of fish gelatin - gum arabic coacervate gels cross-linked by tannic acid,2016,"['Fish gelatin', 'gum arabic coacervate gel', 'Tannic acid', 'Cross-linker', 'Gel strength', 'Rheology', 'Fourier transform infrared']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The propose of this study was to investigate the rheological and structural properties of fish gelatin (FG)-gum arabic (GA) complex coacervate gels treated with oxidized or non-oxidized tannic acid (OX-TA or NO-TA, respectively) at different concentrations ranged from 0.0 to 0.3% (v/v), using compositional, dynamic oscillatory rheological, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analyses. The results revealed that the degree of NO-TA incorporation for cross-linking with FG via hydrogen bindings into the system was more pronounced than affinity of OX-TA for reaction through covalent bindings as evidenced by greater loss in volume fraction, moisture content, and biopolymer content values into the FG-GA coacervate phase. FTIR analysis showed addition of NO-TA led to more molecular disorder into the system, so that higher concentrations (0.2 and 0.3%) of the cross-linker disrupted electrostatic interactions through formation of stronger hydrogen bindings with proteins. Rheological results mentioned that addition and enhancement of (NO- or OX-) TA concentration improved gelling ability and mechanical properties of the FG-GA coacervate gels. However, frequency sweep test results implied that all the gels obtained can be classified as weak gels with shear-thinning behavior. Based on weak gel model, the gels obtained by treated FG-GA coacervates with NO-TA had more developed network structures and stronger intermolecular connectivities than those of obtained by the coacervates modified by OX-TA. The results of the current study provide basic knowledge necessary for the use of reinforced FG-GA complex coacervate gels in many useful applications, such as microencapsulation and hydrogel formation, in food and pharmaceutical industries.

It is assumed that the functionally graded nano-beam made of nickel and silicon nitride and mechanical properties of the nano-beam vary continuously and smoothly in the thickness direction by a simple power-law distribution. Differential quadrature method (DQM), Differential transformation method_Pade approximant (DTM_Pade) and Lumped parameter model (LPM) are used to solve the nonlinear governing equation of the nano-beam, and the obtained results from these methods are compared together. In the end, the effects of size, variation of the length scale parameter, and the volume fraction are discussed and examined. The results show that there are a good agreement between the MSGT and the experimental results, so it can be conclude that the size effect has a substantial impact on the pull-in instability and free vibration results of the beam-type micro/nanoactuator."

The composite FRP pipe element is treated as a beam element. The finite pipe element is constructed in the wavelet space and then transformed to the physical space. Detailed expressions of the mass and stiffness matrices are derived for the composite pipe using the Bspline scaling and wavelet functions. Both Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam theories are considered. The generalized eigenvalue problem is formulated and solved to obtain the modal characteristics of the composite pipe. The developed wavelet-based finite element discretization scheme utilizes significantly less elements compared to the conventional finite element method for modeling composite pipes. Numerical solutions are obtained to demonstrate the accuracy of the developed element, which is verified by comparisons with some available results in the literature."

In addition, to find out the degradation level due to the accelerated aging, tensile strengths of aged papers were measured. As a result, tan δ showed the characteristics of slight decrease at the first stage and then increase with the aging time, which could be analyzed due to the evaporation of remaining moisture and the change of aging rate with time. Also, the trend of tensile strengths with aging temperature and time was appeared to be exponentially decreased and by use of these data equivalent calculated lifetimes and accelerated aging factors were derived for each aging temperatures. After then, tan δ was analyzed with the equivalent operating years. For all different aging temperatures, the aged data were very well fit to the equivalent operating years and it is shown that tan δ was increased with the decrease of tensile strength."
the emergence of the sharing economy: the response strategies of pre-existing taxi industry affected by uber's disruption,2016,"['the sharing economy', 'collaborative consumption', 'Uber', 'creative destruction', ""incumbent's response strategy""]",국문 초록 정보 없음,"What impact does the sharing economy have on existing businesses? This paper empirically examines how Uber transformed the taxi industry in New York City. Using a regression model controlling various potential influencing factors, we find no direct evidence that daily trips or revenue per taxi driver decreased since Uber entered the taxi industry. However, a closer investigation into other dimensions of taxi trips reveals that taxi drivers were forced to change their way of doing businesses to retain existing daily trips and revenue. Since Uber crowded out yellow taxis from the central area of Manhattan, yellow taxis responded by serving customers outside of the Manhattan borough. From enlarging their geographical coverage and serving customers that were previously ignored, yellow taxis were able to retain their previous level of taxi trips and market share. We also find that yellow taxis responded by improving their service quality to better serve customers' needs. Our result suggests that incumbents actively responded to Uber's entry and provided substantial benefit to consumers. Combined with the incumbent's response, the sharing economy transformed the existing market in a welfare-enhancing way. This paper provides managerial and policy implication on how incumbents affected by the disruptions of the sharing economy should respond. Even though it might be yet premature to examine the impact of Uber, results suggest that incumbents have effectively defended against Uber's entry so far. We conclude that the sharing economy and the existing economy can create positive value in our society through well-intentioned competition, complementing each other's weaknesses and strengths."

Bovine serum albumin (BSA), as a model protein, was freeze-dried with aminoclay at various concentrations, and the effects of aminoclay on the structural stability of proteins were compared with those of the conventional stabilizers. The structural characteristics of the protein were determined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), circular dichroism (CD), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Furthermore, physicochemical and morphological characteristics were examined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). XRPD and DSC patterns indicated that the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the amorphous formulation of aminoclay mixed with proteins was gradually elevated as the concentration of aminoclay increased. FTIR and CD spectral analysis suggested that the protein structure was well maintained with aminoclay during the freeze-drying process and 3 months of storage at 4°C and 40°C. Furthermore, aminoclay conferred the greatest protection against aggregation and retained the monomer content of BSA even at a high temperature. The morphological characteristics of lyophilized proteins were also well conserved during the storage with aminoclay. These results suggested that aminoclay may be useful as an alternative stabilizer for maintaining the structural stability of protein formulations.</P>"

I analyze artists’ discussions of professional limitations and the debates surrounding brand acts, or artists’ symbolic range of ambivalent, critical, and pragmatic stances toward media industries. Artists often compare the precarious present of a marginal position within the record business in ex-YU using frames that reference foreign and past elsewheres, including an era of ‘good life’ socialism.

smad4 controls bone homeostasis through regulation of osteoblast/osteocyte viability,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Regulation of osteoblast and osteocyte viability is essential for bone homeostasis. Smad4, a major transducer of bone morphogenetic protein and transforming growth factor-β signaling pathways, regulates apoptosis in various cell types through a mitochondrial pathway. However, it remains poorly understood whether Smad4 is necessary for the regulation of osteoblast and osteocyte viability. In this study, we analyzed Smad4ΔOs mice, in which Smad4 was subjected to tissue-specific disruption under the control of the 2.3-kb Col1a1 promoter, to understand the functional significance of Smad4 in regulating osteoblast/osteocyte viability during bone formation and remodeling. Smad4ΔOs mice showed a significant increase in osteoblast number and osteocyte density in the trabecular and cortical regions of the femur, whereas osteoclast activity was significantly decreased. The proliferation of osteoblasts/osteocytes did not alter, as shown by measuring 5′-bromo-2′deoxyuridine incorporation. By contrast, the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells decreased, together with a decrease in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and in the proteolytic cleavage of caspase 3, in Smad4ΔOs mice. Apoptosis in isolated calvaria cells from Smad4ΔOs mice decreased after differentiation, which was consistent with the results of the TUNEL assay and western blotting in Smad4ΔOs mice. Conversely, osteoblast cells overexpressing Smad4 showed increased apoptosis. In an apoptosis induction model of Smad4ΔOs mice, osteoblasts/osteocytes were more resistant to apoptosis than were control cells, and, consequently, bone remodeling was attenuated. These findings indicate that Smad4 has a significant role in regulating osteoblast/osteocyte viability and therefore controls bone homeostasis."
decoupling of the secondary saliencies in sensorless pmsm drives using repetitive control in the angle domain,2016,"['CwSPMSM', 'Repetitive control', 'Secondary saliencies', 'Sensorless control']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"To decouple the secondary saliencies in sensorless permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) drives, a repetitive control (RC) in the angle domain is proposed. In this paper, the inductance model of a concentrated windings surface-mounted PMSM (cwSPMSM) with strong secondary saliencies is developed. Due to the secondary saliencies, the estimated position contains harmonic disturbances that are periodic relative to the angular position. Through a transformation from the time domain to the angle domain, these varying frequency disturbances can be treated as constant periodic disturbances. The proposed angle-domain RC is plugged into an existing phase-locked loop (PLL) and utilizes the error of the PLL to generate signals to suppress these periodic disturbances. A stability analysis and parameter design guidelines of the RC are addressed in detail. Finally, the proposed method is carried out on a cwSPMSM drive test-bench. The effectiveness and accuracy are verified by experimental results."

Additionally, the feasibility of using such data in the official dairy cattle breeding system for selection of cows with low susceptibility of ketosis was evaluated. A total of 57,190 monthly test-day records for parities 1, 2, and 3 of 7,895 cows with pedigree information were collected from April 2012 to August 2014 from herds enrolled in the Korea Animal Improvement Association. Multi-trait random regression models were separately applied to estimate genetic parameters of test-day records for each parity. The model included fixed herd test-day effects, calving age and season effects, and random regressions for additive genetic and permanent environmental effects. Abundance of variation of acetone may provide a more sensitive indication of ketosis than many zero observations in concentration of milk BHBA. Heritabilities of milk BHBA levels ranged from 0.04 to 0.17 with a mean of 0.09 for the interval between 4 and 305 days in milk during three lactations. The average heritabilities for milk acetone concentration were 0.29, 0.29, and 0.22 for parities 1, 2, and 3, respectively. There was no clear genetic association of the concentration of two ketone bodies with three test-day milk production traits, even if some correlations among breeding values of the test-day records in this study were observed. These results suggest that genetic selection for low susceptibility of ketosis in early lactation is possible. Further, it is desirable for the breeding scheme of dairy cattle to include the records of milk acetone rather than the records of milk BHBA."

an improved algorithm for computing transfer function matrices of descriptor systems,2016,"['Descriptor system', 'Transfer function matrix', 'QZ decomposition', 'Generalized Schur decomposition']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In this paper, we propose a numerically reliable algorithm for computing the transfer function matrix of a descriptor system. Descriptor system has widely been used. The system often arises when modelling a linear system. Linear systems such as inversion are often represented in terms of descriptor systems. Although the representation is useful, it is not appropriate for simulation and experiment. A remedy for the problem is transforming proper descriptor system into state space system by way of transfer function matrix. Numerical algorithm for computing the transfer function matrix of a descriptor system has been reported. The algorithm makes use of QZ decomposition which can be used for computing generalized eigenvalues of a matrix pencil. However, when matrices have the repeated eigenvalues, numerical errors can be generated by using the method. Furthermore, since the theory of the algorithm is based on power method which needs iterative computation, the convergence time would be slower at that time. We propose an algorithm that avoids solving generalized eigenvalue problem. Since our algorithm avoids QZ decomposition, the repeated eigenvalues does not matter. Moreover, the computational time can be estimated."

Sr and Cu ion adsorption experiments were conducted with PAN/FZ beads. A pseudo-second-order model fit the kinetic data for Sr and Cu ion adsorption by PAN/FZ beads well. The equilibrium data fitted well with the Langmuir isotherm model, and the maximum adsorption capacities were 96.5 mg/g and 74.6 mg/g for the Sr and Cu ions, respectively. Additionally, the values of thermodynamic parameters such as Gibbs free energy (ΔG°), enthalpy (ΔH°) and entropy (ΔS°) were determined. The positive values of ΔH° revealed the endothermic nature of the adsorption process and the negative values of ΔGo were indicative of the spontaneity of the adsorption process."

Boris Yeltsin Government introduced the model of radical transition of political system, losing control over the region and experiencing the extreme confusion from the transition. Chinese workers advancing into Russian Far East had some degree of impact on the systemic transition of Russia.Russia was at a qualitative turning point in the policy of political system transition from 2000. The central government began to have an efficient influence on local government and national society restored the stability and order. Over the period, Russian government started to intervene in Chinese workers’ advancing into Russian Far East and impose restriction on the activity of Chinese workers migrating to the region.There is a correlation between the nature of system transition and Chinese workers coming into Russian Far East. During the transition from confusion of transformation to qualitative transformation in regard to the method of solving the labor shortage required to develop the region of Far East, the influx and activities of Chinese workers were restricted. The focus was shifted to Russian central government from Chinese workers in terms of the relation between development and workforce."
music/voice separation based on kernel back-fitting using weighted β-order mmse estimation,2016,"['Kernel back-fitting', 'separation', 'generalized weighted β-order MMSE estimation', 'singular value decomposition.']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Recent developments in the field of separation of mixed signals into music/voice components have attracted the attention of many researchers. Recently, iterative kernel back-fitting, also known as kernel additive modeling, was proposed to achieve good results for music/voice separation. To obtain minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimates of short-time Fourier transforms of sources, generalized spatial Wiener filtering (GW) is typically used. In this paper, we propose an advanced music/voice separation method that utilizes a generalized weighted β-order MMSE estimation (WbE) based on iterative kernel back-fitting (KBF). In the proposed method, WbE is used for the step of mixed music signal separation, while KBF permits kernel spectrogram model fitting at each iteration. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better separation performance than GW and existing Bayesian estimators."
bistatic isar image reconstruction using sparse-recovery interpolation of missing data,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>When a bistatic inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) system fails to collect complete radar cross section (RCS) datasets, bistatic ISAR (Bi-ISAR) images are usually corrupted using the conventional Fourier transform (FT)-based imaging algorithm. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a new Bi-ISAR image reconstruction method that includes three steps: suboptimal estimation of parameters regarding the bistatic angle in the Bi-ISAR signal model via an orthogonal matching pursuit-type group-searching scheme, Bi-ISAR signal reconstruction using the estimated parameters, and Bi-ISAR image generation using the FT-based imaging algorithm applied to the reconstructed Bi-ISAR signal. To validate the reconstruction capability of the proposed method, bistatic-scattered field data using the physical optics technique as well as the point-scatterer model are used for Bi-ISAR image reconstruction. The results show that the proposed sparse-recovery-interpolation approach based on the Bi-ISAR signal model reconstruction combined with the classical FT-based algorithm can yield high reconstruction accuracy for incomplete bistatic RCS data compared to conventional numerical interpolation methods and existing direct sparse reconstruction techniques.</P>"

Effective capacity theory, which evaluates wireless channel capacityfrom a novel view, is utilized to model the system capacity under delay QoS constraints of the link layer.Since intensity modulation of light is used in the system, problems caused by frequency selectivity canbe neglected. Then, the BA problem can be formulated as an integer programming problem and it is furtherrelaxed and transformed into a concave one. Lagrangian formulation is used to reformulate the concaveproblem. Considering the inefficiency of traditional gradient-based schemes and the demand for distributedimplementation in local area networks, we localize the global parameters and propose a quasi-distributedquadratic allocation algorithm to provide two-level service guarantees, the first level is QoS oriented, andthe second level is QoE oriented. Simulations have shown the efficient performance of the proposedalgorithm.

size-resolved source emission rates of indoor ultrafine particles considering coagulation,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Indoor ultrafine particles (UFP, <100 nm) released from combustion and consumer products lead to elevated human exposure to UFP. UFP emitted from the sources undergo aerosol transformation processes such as coagulation and deposition. The coagulation effect can be significant during the source emission due to high concentration and high mobility of nanosize particles. However, few studies have estimated size-resolved UFP source emission strengths while considering coagulation in their theoretical and experimental research work. The primary objective of this study is to characterize UFP source strength by considering coagulation in addition to other indoor processes (i.e., deposition and ventilation) in a realistic setting. A secondary objective is to test a hypothesis that size-resolved UFP source emission rates are unimodal and log-normally distributed for three common indoor UFP sources: an electric stove, a natural gas burner, and a paraffin wax candle. Experimental investigations were performed in a full-scale test building. Size- and time-resolved concentrations of UFP ranging from 2 to 100 nm were monitored using a scanning mobility particle sizer (SNIPS). Based on the temporal evolution of the particle size distribution during the source emission period, the size dependent source emission rate was determined using a material-balance modeling approach. The results indicate that, for a given UFP source, the source strength varies with particle size and source type. The analytical model assuming a log normally distributed source emission rate could predict the temporal evolution of the particle size distribution with reasonable accuracy for the gas stove and the candle. Including the effect of coagulation was found to increase the estimates of source strengths by up to a factor of 8. This result implies that previous studies on indoor UFP source strengths considering only deposition and ventilation might have largely underestimated the true values of UFP source strengths, especially for combustion due to the natural gas stove and the candle.</P>"

As these have taken up increasing proportion of Corporate Korea’s human resources management, this phenomenon merits an in-depth analysis so as to see how non-regular workers influence corporate results.Our study shows that output based compensation and employment security hold a statistical meaning to ‘subjective’ financial results. Meanwhile, employment security pact, contrary to hypothesis, yields negative influence on subjective financial results. As for labor productivity, positive influence came up with output-based appraisal, job-analysis and employees participation. Our analysis looked for actual proofs in how HRM practices and moderating effect of irregular ratio affect corporate performance. It edifies that, if irregular workers take up a bigger proportion, such strategic HRM practices as formal training scheme, job descriptions, and employee participation became significant.Id est, the more irregular workers, the more useful are formal training programs and job descriptions; employees’ participation can be reflected into management plan with positive results.This study concludes as follows. A few HRM practices that had been considered as ‘best practice’ are now out of sync with today’s Corporate Korea as environments shifted; if irregular workers take up bigger proportion, universalistic HRM practices are called for to make a difference. Further to this study, we enumerated the four areas that need more research, and we came up with a layout of how our future research work will develop."

The empirical analysis on the economic effect of Resolution 2270 is important, for it provides the meaningful reference to evaluate the change of North Korea’s stance in the near future and set up policy alternatives toward such a change. North Korea’s import of capital goods, equipment parts, fuel and raw materials seems to play the role of another input in the production process. Then it is reasonable to think the extended production function in North Korea, that includes North Korea’s import as another factor of production besides labor and capital elements. The extended production function model is used in this paper to empirically analyze the economic effect of the new resolution. Specifically this study investigates the effect on North Korea’s real GDP when the provision to prohibit North Korea’s export of coal, iron and iron ore causes the decrease in export revenue to be used for the payment of North Korea’s import.North Korea’s annual data ranging from 1980 to 2014 is used for the empirical analysis. Findings are as follows: first, when North Korea’s export of coal, iron and iron ore is prohibited, export revenue is decreased by about 150 million dollars, and the consequent decrease in North Korea’s import may result in about 7.6% drop in North Korea’s real GDP. Secondly, the decrease of cash income through the shut down of the Gaeseoung industrial complex is about 120 million dollars. Consequently it may cause about 0.6 drop in North Korea’s real GDP. Thirdly, even though the provision to prohibit the exportation of workers from North Korea is not included in the new resolution, it is likely that such a provision may be additionally included in the resolution if North Korea continues to commit military provocations. It is reported that North Korea may get about 300~500 million dollars annually from the exportation of workers. Then the prohibition of the exportation of North Korean workers may reduce North Korea’s real GDP by about 1.5~2.5%.All empirical findings about the economic effect of sanctions are just about the short run effect. Eventually the reduction in North Korea’s overall production through the decrease in North Korea’s import may affect the capacity of reproduction in the North Korean economy. In the long run, it damages the functioning of the North Korean economy seriously. It is expected that North Korea may respond to economic sanctions of the new resolution through the mobilization of domestic resources. Considering the current situation of the North Korean economy, without the institutionalization of North Korea’s market such as institutional guarantees of user rights or proprietary rights on production assets, it could not succeed in the efficient mobilization of domestic resources enough to overcome the economic downturn caused by Resolution 2270.

While this transformation contains not only economic growth but also democratization and the quality of life, the compressed development raises some important questions: to what extent the Korean story can be accounted for? What really covers beneath the surface of the economic miracle? Much ink has been spilt in an effort to answer these provoking riddles by focusing on cultural residues and the role of IT as the driving engine of development. This study presents the basic matrix of three analytical dimensions in which developmental pathways can be revealed: ideology, analytical level, developmental arena. The power shift from state-sponsored growth to the quest for quality of life has taken the luster off the developmental model, though whether the previous model has outlived its effectiveness remains a matter of intense controversy. Despite the contrasting views, at the roots of Korean success story lie the dynamics of culture and its response to impacts of new IT development. A Korean culture that stresses creativity and hybrid ways of thinking, as well as its traditional catch up attitude, will be necessary for the country to pursue future development with the IT innovation."
recombinant glargine insulin production process using escherichia coli,2016,"['Diabetes', 'glargine', 'fed-batch fermentation', 'citraconylation', 'Arg (B31)-insulin']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Glargine insulin is a long-acting insulin analog that helps blood glucose maintenance in patients with diabetes. We constructed the pPT-GI vector to express prepeptide glargine insulin when transformed into Escherichia coli JM109. The transformed E. coli cells were cultured by fed-batch fermentation. The final dry cell mass was 18 g/l. The prepeptide glargine insulin was 38.52% of the total protein. It was expressed as an inclusion body and then refolded to recover the biological activity. To convert the prepeptide into glargine insulin, citraconylation and trypsin cleavage were performed. Using citraconylation, the yield of enzymatic conversion for glargine insulin increased by 3.2-fold compared with that without citraconylation. After the enzyme reaction, active glargine insulin was purified by two types of chromatography (ion-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase chromatography). We obtained recombinant human glargine insulin at 98.11% purity and verified that it is equal to the standard of human glargine insulin, based on High-performance liquid chromatography analysis and Matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry. We thus established a production process for high-purity recombinant human glargine insulin and a method to block Arg (B31)-insulin formation. This established process for recombinant human glargine insulin may be a model process for the production of other human insulin analogs."

For easeof exploration, we first investigate the static coverage problem of two-agent systems in flowing environment andpresent an example by extending the two-agent systems into the general case. In addition, Gaussian Estimationis introduced to predict the value of the sensory function through the sampled measurements. By using the staticcoverage partition as theoretical foundation, we transform the optimal coverage control into the moving targettracking problems, where the target is the centroid of the assigned region for each ASV. Based on these techniques,a decentralized kinematic control algorithm is developed to navigate the multi-ASV systems. Furthermore, theadaptive back-stepping techniques are employed to extend the kinematic controller into dynamic case with uncertainmodel parameters. Finally, simulation studies are provided to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of theproposed approaches."

First of all, I investigate how Rancière theoretically develops his model of critical art on the basis of his doctrines of ‘politics of aesthetics’ and ‘the aesthetic regime of art’, specifically how Rancière derives ‘a third (way of) aesthetic politics’ from tensions between two logics of aesthetic politics inherent on the politics of aesthetics, how this third aesthetic politics forms the theoretical backbone of Rancière’s critical art, and how such key notions as ‘dissensus’, ‘fiction’, and ‘equality’ in ‘the aesthetic regime of art’ make up strategic elements of Rancière’s theory of critical art. Second, I thereby deal with questions of how Rancière analyzes that critical art has shifted from the dialectical clash in the 1960s and 1970s to the co-presence of heterogeneous elements since the 1990s, and that contemporary art has transformed into its various forms such as ‘play’, ‘archive’, ‘relation’, and ‘mystery’, entering into the period of ‘consensus’. Lastly, I move on to discuss how Rancière’s belief in critical art - despite the era of the so-called ‘post-politics’ when scepticism on the possibility of critical art has been rampant - are at once shared by his contemporary theorists such as Chantal Mouffe and Alain Badiou, and also in contrast or conflict with them when it comes to such questions as ‘consensus and dissensus’, ‘activist art’, ‘the truth of art’, and ‘democracy’."

In general, the physico-chemical properties of such 2-D nanohybrids are strongly correlated with their heterostructures, but it is not easy to solve the crystal structures due to their low crystallinity and high anisotropic nature. However, the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis method is thought to be the most powerful means of understanding the interlayer structures of intercalant molecules. If a proper number of well-developed (00l) XRD peaks are available for such 2-D nanohybrids, the 1-D electron density along the crystallographic c-axis can be calculated via a Fourier transform analysis to obtain structural information about the orientations and arrangements of guest species in the interlayer space."

temperature dependent dislocation bypass mechanism for coherent precipitates in cu–co alloys,2016,"['Precipitation strengthening', 'Dislocation glide', 'Critical resolved shear stress', 'Molecular dynamics simulation', 'Cu&#x2013']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Molecular dynamics simulations of dislocation interaction with coherent cobalt precipitates embedded in Cu-Co alloys reveal a temperature dependent bypass mechanism. Below 300 K, the trailing partial dislocation clearly bypasses the coherent, face centered cubic (FCC) cobalt precipitate by Orowan looping, caused by a reversible structural transformation as the leading partial locally converts the precipitate to the lower-energy hexagonal close packed (HCP) structure. The FCC versus HCP energy difference of cobalt is temperature dependent, and the dislocation bypass mechanism becomes pure shear above 300 K. Based on a combination of inertial effects due to phonon drag and this observed bypass mechanism, we develop a temperature dependent critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) model, which is in excellent agreement with long-standing measurements of the CRSS temperature dependence of Cu-Co alloys, and those obtained from MD simulation. The model explains both the CRSS increase at low temperatures and the existence of a peak value around 200 K. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</P>"

The delay factor is assumed to be random delay which belongs to a given interval and parameter uncertainties are considered with linear fractional transformation form. By implementing a proper novel Lyapunov functional together with linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, a new set of delay-dependent sufficient conditions is derived to guarantee the asymptotic stability of TS fuzzy system with a prescribed H-infinity performance index. Further, a reliable robust H-infinity control design with an appropriate gain matrix has been derived to achieve the robust asymptotic stability for uncertain TS fuzzy system. Further, Schur complement and Jensen's integral inequality are used to simplify the derivation in the main results. The set of sufficient conditions is established using the relationship among the random time-varying delay and its lower and upper bounds, which can be easily solved by MATLAB LMI toolbox.

The polynomial models developed by RSM for pH, solubility and yield were highly effective in describing the relationships between factors (P<0.05). Increased molar ratios of calcined powder (BCCP) from butter clam shell led to reduced solubility, yield, color values and overall quality. The critical values of multiple response optimization to independent variables were 1.75 M and 0.94 M for lactic acid and BCCP, respectively. The actual values (pH 7.23, 97.42% for solubility and 423.22% for yield) under optimization conditions were similar to the predicted values. White indices of BCCLs were in the range of 86.70–90.86.

Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) offer an alternative strategy in which carbon elimination is conducted by anaerobic microorganisms that transport respiratory electrons originating from carbon oxidation to an anode. Hence, chemical energy is directly transformed into electrical energy. In this study, the use and stability of barcodecontaining exoelectrogenic model biofilms under non-axenic wastewater treatment conditions are described. Genomic barcodes were integrated in Shewanella oneidensis, Geobacter sulfurreducens, and G. metallireducens. These barcodes are unique for each strain and allow distinction between those cells and naturally occurring wild types as well as quantification of the amount of cells in a biofilm via multiplex qPCR. MFCs were pre-incubated with these three strains, and after 6 days the anodes were transferred into MFCs containing synthetic wastewater with 1% wastewater sludge. Over time, the system stabilized and the coulomb efficiency was constant. Overall, the initial synthetic biofilm community represented half of the anodic population at the end of the experimental timeline. The part of the community that contained a barcode was dominated by G. sulfurreducens cells (61.5%), while S. oneidensis and G. metallireducens cells comprised 10.5% and 17.9%, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to describe the stability of a synthetic exoelectrogenic consortium under non-axenic conditions.

The results of two-level hierarchical linear models (HLM) refute the hyperglobalist thesis for the universal convergence of values as a result of globalization, i.e., more globalized countries are characterized by the declining relevance of traditional markers of identity (e.g., nationality and religion) and their replacement with values that are more democratic and tolerant. Rather, findings lend support to the skeptical and transformative theses that focus on the enduring influence of cultural traditions on adolescents’ value systems. Adolescents’ supports for democratic values and immigrant rights do not vary across countries in accordance with the level of globalization. The influence of a country’s cultural tradition on adolescents’ attitudes toward religion, nation-states, and gender equality persists, even after controlling for the effect of globalization. A supplementary analysis also reveals that what conditions the effect of globalization on adolescents’ value orientations is economic development rather than democratic advancement."

In vivo immunomodulatory activity of RPS-2 was evaluated in normal and cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppressed mice. The results showed that the molecular weights of RPS-1, RPS-2, and RPS-3 were 600, 990, and 1300 kDa, respectively. RPS-1 and RPS-2 were mainly composed of galactose, rhamnose, galacturonic acid, and glucuronic acid, while RPS-3 was mainly composed of galactose, rhamnose, galacturonic acid, glucuronic acid, and glucose. FT-IR and NMR spectrum data indicated a rhamnogalacturonan I characteristic of polysaccharide. Both RPS and its purified fractions RPS-1, RPS-2, and RPS-3 significantly increased RAW264.7 cell proliferation, nitric oxide (NO) production, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ, and interleukin (IL)-10 secretion (P < .05). The purified fraction RPS-2 also increased the spleen index, splenocyte proliferation, and cytokine secretion in vivo. These results indicate that okra polysaccharides may potentially serve as novel immunomodulators."
fyn deficiency attenuates renal fibrosis by inhibition of phospho-stat3,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The hallmark of renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis is the accumulation of myofibroblasts and extracellular matrix proteins. Fyn, a member of the Src family of kinases, has diverse biological functions including regulation of mitogenic signaling and proliferation and integrin-mediated interaction. Src family proteins promote pulmonary fibrosis by augmenting transforming growth factor-beta signaling, but their role in renal fibrosis is less understood. We observed upregulation of Fyn in a renal fibrosis model induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction. Upon ureteral obstruction, Fyn-deficient mice exhibited attenuated renal fibrosis relative to wild-type mice. Furthermore, obstruction-induced renal expression of type I collagen, fibronectin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 was suppressed. Pharmacologic inhibition of Fyn blocked induction of extracellular matrix proteins in kidney cell lines. Importantly, the attenuation of renal fibrosis by Fyn deficiency was not accompanied by changes in the Smad pathway. Rather, the antifibrotic effect of Fyn deficiency was associated with downregulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Small, interfering RNA targeting STAT3 in Fyn-deficient cells further suppressed alpha-smooth muscle actin expression, whereas a STAT3 activator partially restored plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression, indicating that STAT3 signaling is critically involved in this process. Thus, Fyn plays an important role in renal fibrosis. Hence, Fyn kinase inhibitors may be therapeutically useful against renal fibrosis.</P>"
nanoporous carbon synthesized from grass for removal and recovery of hexavalent chromium,2016,"['porous carbon', 'Brunauer–Emmett–Teller', 'surface area', 'adsorption']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Nanoporous carbon structures were synthesized by pyrolysis of grass as carbon precursor. The synthesized carbon has high surface area and pore volume. The carbon products were acid functionalized and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller, transmission electron microscopy, and Energy Dispersive X-ray microanalysis. Acid functionalized nanoporous carbon was explored for use in removal of toxic Cr(VI) ions from aqueous media. An adsorption study was done as a function of initial concentration, pH, contact time, temperature, and interfering ions. The experimental equilibrium data fits well to Langmuir isotherm model with maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 35.335 mg/g. The results indicated that removal obeys a pseudo-second-order kinetic model, and that equilibrium was reached in 10 min. A desorption study was done using NaOH. The results of the present study imply that acid functionalized nanoporous carbon synthesized from grass is an efficient, renewable, cost-effective adsorbent material for removal of hexavalent chromium due to its faster removal rate and reusability."
deformable strokes towards temporally coherent video painting,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>We present an automatic and robust technique for creating non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) and animation, starting from a video that depicts the shape details and follows the motion of underlying objects. We generate NPR from the initial frame of the source video using a greedy algorithm for stroke placements and models, in combination with a saliency map and a flow-guided difference-of-Gaussian filter. Our stroke model uses a set of triangles whose vertices are particles and whose edges are springs. Using a physics-based framework, the generated and rendered strokes are translated, rotated and deformed by forces exerted from the sequential frames. External forces acting on strokes are calculated according to temporally and spatially smoothed per-pixel optical flow vectors. After simulating each frame, we delete unnecessary strokes and add new strokes for disappearing and appearing objects, but only if necessary to avoid popping and scintillation. Our framework automatically generates the coherent animation of rendered strokes, preserving the appearance details and animating strokes along with the underlying objects. This had been difficult to achieve with previous user-guided methods and automatic but limited transformations methods.</P>"

stem cell differentiation-related protein-loaded plga microspheres as a novel platform micro-typed scaffold for chondrogenesis,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>During cell differentiation for tissue regeneration, several factors, including growth factors and proteins, influence cascades in stem cells such as embryonic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). In this study, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 3 and SOX9, which is an important protein in chondrocytes, were used to generate mature chondrocytes from human MSCs (hMSCs). For safe and effective delivery of bioactive molecules into hMSCs, biodegradable poly-(D, L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microspheres (MSs) were coated with TGF-beta 3 and loaded with SOX9. Instead of SOX9 protein, release of the model protein FITC-bovine serum albumin (BSA) from PLGA MS was evaluated in vitro and in vivo by confocal laser microscopy and Kodak imaging. The bioactivities of TGF-beta 3 and SOX9 were evaluated by assessing alpha-helical formation using circular dichroism. PLGA MS loaded with FITC-BSA easily entered hMSCs without causing cytotoxicity. To confirm that internalization of PLGA MSs harboring TGF-beta 3 and SOX9 induced chondrogenesis of hMSCs, we performed several molecular analyses. By analysis, the specific marker gene expression levels in hMSCs adhered onto PLGA MSs coated with TGF-beta 3 and loaded with SOX9 were more than 3-5 times that of the control group both in vitro and in vivo. This result revealed that PLGA MS uptake and subsequent release of SOX9 induced chondrogenesis of hMSCs was enhanced by coating PLGA MSs with TGF-beta 3.</P>"

The effects of different parameters, including hydroxyapatite synthesis method and removal process type, pH, reaction time, temperature and amount of hydroxyapatite, were investigated and optimized by Taguchi design. The kinetics of adsorption and isotherm studies showed that the pseudo-second-order model and the Freundlich isotherm were the best choices to describe the adsorptive behavior of hydroxyapatite. Photocatalytic degradation of dye followed Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, illustrated a pseudo-first-order kinetic model with the adsorption equilibrium constant and kinetic rate constant of surface reaction equal to 0.011 (l mg−1) and 1.3 (mg l−1 min−1), respectively."
linear quadratic regulation and tracking using output feedback with direct feedthrough,2016,"['Direct feedthrough', 'Linear quadratic', 'Regulation and Tracking', 'Output feedback']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper presents the development of linear quadratic regulation and output tracking algorithms using output feedback when both the measurement and performance output equations contain direct feedthrough terms. Although all physical systems can be modeled without direct feedthrough, there are still many situations where system models with direct feedthrough are important. For this situation, we modify previous work on the same topic for systems without direct feedthrough. It is shown that for the regulation problem, the optimal output feedback gain for a direct feedthrough case can be directly obtained, via a transformation, from the approach used for systems without direct feedthrough. However, for the tracking problem, a new set of coupled matrix equations for determining the optimal output feedback gain is derived from the necessary conditions for minimizing the cost function. The effectiveness of the developed algorithms is demonstrated using numerical examples."

Imperial Japan""s general mobilization system was a social system for war which the military and government authorities constructed, comparing with the western model after analyzing the patterns of total war that emerged from the First World War. The authorities started the reorganization of ‘home front’ and ideological manipulation at an earlier stage, in order to overcome the inferiority for material resources and economic power, and supplement the immature patriotism(devoid of civil consciousness). How the functional or local organizations were organized and managed by government-sponsored movements could be a good measure in evaluating the characteristics of Japanese version of totalitarianism. More detailed research should be conducted in the future as to how local organization such as Buraku-kai were transformed and mobilized in wartime. In the respect of ideological manipulation, a unique statism such as the ideology of ‘Imperial Way’, ‘Kokutairon (國體論)’, ‘Japanese spirits’ were circulated widely. Careful reconsideration is needed about invented or adapted culture in the context of war such as Bushido. In the formation of social system, culture, academic discipline, the experience of military mobilization is irreversible. Looking into the cultural legacy of military mobilization in various postwar histories through concepts such as emulation, transplant, continuity, distortion, revival can be a kind of work for the anthropology of war."

In this context, this study attempts to suggest how IT technology can be efficiently harnessed through the usage of mobile devices in the planning stage of fashion materials, where the initial production plan of a clothing item is mapped out. This study ultimately aims to enhance the effectiveness of databases on fashion material information by using mobile devices to utilize NFC, an RFID technology having as much revolutionary power as Internet . which can be the convergence between IT and fashion across the software dimensions. To pursue this research, data on fashion material information regarding 200 woven fabric specimens were provided by textile companies. The information includes elements such as its composition, weight, width, yarn, density and sales report. These pieces of information were organized into a database. Drawing on this data, Android-based applications that allow smart phones to read off fabric information from NFC tags were developed for this study using two methods. The system works as follows: 1. NFC tag stickers are attached onto the hangers where 200 fabric samples are hanging. 2. The NFC tag stickers are tagged, or read off from a smart phone that support NFC functions. 3. Upon tagging, the Smart phone swiftly displays all information available on its screen - not only the aforementioned six elements, but also the image of the clothing item from the fabric in its finalized product form, and the video of the model wearing the item. for convenient view.

tyrosine kinase inhibitors in ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia therapy: a review,2016,"['Tyrosine kinase inhibitors', 'targeted therapy', 'minimal residual disease', 'colony forming units']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative hematopoietic stem cell disorder. Deregulated BCR-ABL fusion tyrosine kinase activity is the main cause of CML disease pathogenesis, making BCR-ABL an ideal target for inhibition. Current tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) designed to inhibit BCR-ABL oncoprotein activity, have completely transformed the prognosis of CML. Interruption of TKI treatment leads to minimal residual disease reside (MRD), thought to reside in TKI-insensitive leukaemia stem cells which remain a potential reservoir for disease relapse. This highlights the need to develop new therapeutic strategies for CML either as small molecule master TKIs or phytopharmaceuticals derived from nature to achieve chronic molecular remission. This review outlines the past, present and future therapeutic approaches for CML including coverage of relevant mechanisms, whether ABL dependent or independent, and epigenetic factors responsible for developing resistance against TKIs. Appearance of mutant clones along the course of therapy either pre-existing or induced due to therapy is still a challenge for the clinician. A proposed in-vitro model of generating colony forming units from CML stem cells derived from diagnostic samples seems to be achievable in the era of high throughput technology which can take care of single cell genomic profiling."

배지 조성이 물냉이 모상근의 글루코시놀레이트 축적에 미치는 영향,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Background : Nasturtium officinale, belongs to the Brassicaceae, is a perennial plant growing in and around natural watersystem. It is commonly called watercress and commercially consumed as a salad crop in many countries. Hairy root cultures (HRCs), transformed by Agrobacterium rhizogenes (A. rhizogenes), have been noted for an experimental model system in plant metabolic engineering for the synthesis of natural products since hairy roots have fascinating properties including biochemical and genetic stability, high biosynthetic capacity for secondary metabolites and rapid growth rates. Methods and Results : The dry weights (DW) of watercress hairy roots was measured after 4-days freeze dryer. The highest weight was recorded after HRCs in SH and half-strength SH medium, followed by the levels of DW in MS and half-strength medium. However, the level of DW after HRCs in half-strength medium was lowest. SH medium is the most suitable for the growth of watercress hairy roots. Glucosinolate contents in the hairy roots varied responding to the basal media. 1/2 SH basal media resulted in the lowest value of total glucosinolate. MS basal media, however, resulted in the highest value of total glucosinolate, as well as the highest accumulation of each glucosinolate. The hairy roots cultured in 1/2 MS basal media showed the second highest value of total glucosinolate, followed by B5, SH and 1/2 B5. The accumulation of 4-Methoxyglucobrassicin and gluconasturtiin was also secondly higher in the hairy roots in 1/2 MS. In contrast, the level of 4-Hydroxyglucobrassicin and glucobrassicin were the second highest after culturing in SH and B5, respectively. Conclusion : In this study, media played a main role in growth and glucosinolate accumulation in watercress hairy roots. SH and half-strength SH media enabled the rate growth of hairy roots to be highest. In contrast, the highest accumulation of glucosinolate was recorded after HRCs in MS media. The current study suggests HRCs of watercress could be one of an effective alternative approaches for the enhanced production of glucosinolates"

The Continuous rotation technique obtains 6-component loads on bluff bodies with 1-degree azimuth resolution about selected axes at a rate of 1 revolution per minute. The load coefficient variation is Fourier transformed and the resulting complex series is truncated in order to obtain rapidly computable, analytical formulae. The method is applied to bluff body shapes including cylinders, a cuboid, a flat plate and a porous box. A cylinder whose length is equal to its diameter, is used to show that rate effects, hysteresis, vortex shedding and other unsteady aerodynamic phenomena are negligible below 10 revolutions per minute. Approaches to generalize the aerodynamic loads on yawed finite cylinders of various aspect ratio are studied. The reasons for differences in aerodynamic load behavior between 2 cylinder models, are analyzed. To complement experiments, the ROTCFD unsteady Navier Stokes code is used to perform diagnostic computations. Methods to generalize the predictions are explored. Maps of the leading coefficients of the Fourier series of each load component over the aspect ratios space, are interpolated. The interpolation varies sharply for aspect ratios between 0.5 to 1. The variation is more gradual beyond aspect ratio 2. By aspect ratio 4, a ‘high aspect ratio’ limit appears to be reached."

Training and civil societies' monitoring and criticism do not influence on that of SMG headquarter organization.To improve the organizational effectiveness of SMG headquarter organization, this paper suggested SMG first, empower management class officials above the 3th grade for enhancement their transactional leadership, second, upgrade the training system and job satisfaction, and third, expand exchanges and cooperation with civil societies."
tfap2c-mediated upregulation of tgfbr1 promotes lung tumorigenesis and epithelial–mesenchymal transition,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"TFAP2C (transcription factor-activating enhancer-binding protein 2C) expression has been positively correlated with poor prognosis in patients with certain types of cancer, but the mechanisms underlying TFAP2C-mediated tumorigenesis in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are still unknown. We previously performed a microarray analysis to identify TFAP2C regulation genes, and TGFBR1 (transforming growth factor-β receptor type 1) was found to be upregulated by TFAP2C. We observed that TFAP2C or TGFBR1 overexpression led to oncogenic properties, such as cell viability, proliferation and cell cycle progression. TGFBR1 upregulation induced by TFAP2C also promoted cell motility and migration, leading to malignant development. We also found that PAK1 (p21 protein (Cdc42/Rac)-activated kinase 1) signaling was involved in TFAP2C/ TGFBR1-induced tumorigenesis. These results were confirmed by an in vivo xenograft model and patient tissue samples. This study shows that TFAP2C promoted tumor progression by upregulation of TGFBR1 and consequent activation of PAK1 signaling."

cu2+ ion reduction in wastewater over rdf-derived char,2016,"['adsorption', 'activation', 'char', 'pyrolysis']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Refuse-derived fuel (RDF) produced using municipal solid waste was pyrolyzed to produce RDF char. For the first time, the RDF char was used to remove aqueous copper, a representative heavy metal water pollutant. Activation of the RDF char using steam and KOH treatments was performed to change the specific surface area, pore volume, and the metal cation quantity of the char. N2 sorption, Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometer (ICP-AES), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were used to characterize the char. The optimum pH for copper removal was shown to be 5.5, and the steam-treated char displayed the best copper removal capability. Ion exchange between copper ions and alkali/alkaline metal cations was the most important mechanism of copper removal by RDF char, followed by adsorption on functional groups existing on the char surface. The copper adsorption behavior was represented well by a pseudo-second-order kinetics model and the Langmuir isotherm. The maximum copper removal capacity was determined to be 38.17 mg/g, which is larger than those of other low-cost char adsorbents reported previously."
the statistical optimization of bacterial cellulose production via semi-continuous operation mode,2016,['Bacterial cellulose Optimization Fermentation Semi-continuous culture Response surface methodology (RSM)'],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Bacterial cellulose (BC) is highly pure and has a higher crystallinity and molecular weight than plantcellulose. Therefore, BC can be used in many different areas such as biotechnology, pharmaceutical,cosmetics. Because of the price of BC, the productivity of BC is an important parameter for industrial scaleapplications. In this study, BC was produced in static culture using a semi-continuous operation mode;the conditions were optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). The collected BC wascharacterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM),and tensile strength. Optimization parameters were selected as glucose concentration, surface area/volume ratio, surface area and incubation day intervals. The optimum values for incubation dayintervals, volume changing ratios, glucose concentrations and surface area/volume ratios were 7 days,66%, 50 g/L and 1.22 cm 1, respectively. BC productivity reached 0.284 g/L/day under optimalconditions, while the model equation proposed 0.289 g/L/day.

In this paper, we propose a single-pass content-aware video encoding scheme for such applications to achieve a consistent video quality while satisfying the bit-rate constraints. To achieve the objective we developed: 1) scene descriptor based on the discrete cosine transformation coefficients obtained from the video encoder; 2) a parameterized analytic distortion model for video encoding using the scene descriptor; 3) scene change detection based on the encoded MB mode ratio; and 4) a single-pass consistent video quality control scheme which exploits 1), 2), and 3). Experimental results show that the proposed method results in less deviation from the target distortion and less distortion variance than the up-to-date best result by up to 65.25% and 75.88%, respectively, while satisfying the given rate constraints. The computing time overhead in the proposed method was 0.560% and 0.571% for the variable and constrained variable bit-rate mode, respectively, which is negligible in nearly all embedded applications.</P>"

Athanasius thought that the incarnation took place to deify humanity since the Word made flesh assumes humanity and transforms it in the image of God. Believers enter into this reality by participating in the Holy Spirit. This essay argues that one of the best theological modes for this aspect of the working of the Holy Spirit is found in the pneumatology of empowerment advanced in Luke-Acts.

The ORR efficiency can be readily evaluated by examining the adsorption strength of atomic oxygen on the surface of catalysts (i.e., known as a descriptor) and the adsorption energy can be controlled by transforming the surface geometry of catalysts. In the current study, the effect of the surface geometry of catalysts (i.e., strain effect) on the adsorption strength of atomic oxygen on platinum catalysts was analyzed by using density functional theory (DFT). The optimized lattice constant of Pt (3.977 Å) was increased and decreased by 1% to apply tensile and compressive strain to the Pt surface. Then the oxygen adsorption strengths on the modified Pt surfaces were compared and the electron charge density of the O-adsorbed Pt surfaces was analyzed. As the interatomic distance increased, the oxygen adsorption strength became stronger and the d-band center of the Pt surface atoms was shifted toward the Fermi level, implying that anti-bonding orbitals were shifted to the conduction band from the valence band (i.e., the anti-bonding between O and Pt was less likely formed). Consequently, enhanced ORR efficiency may be expected if the surface Pt-Pt distance can be reduced by approximately 2~4% compared to the pure Pt owing to the moderately controlled oxygen binding strength for improved ORR."

First of all, a closed-form solution is proposed and then, a numerical analysis is performed for some comparison and validation purposes. The closed-form solution is developed by solving the frame equations of motion, directly. For this reason, some mathematical techniques such as Fourier transform and the well-known complementary solutions are utilized. In this process, some differential equations must be solved, and several boundary conditions should be satisfied. Afterward, the free vibration parameters of the frame are attained. These parameters are also obtained using finite element method as a numerical analysis and it is observed that the results obtained by this approach are completely coincident with the result of closed-form solution. Also, seismic parameters of the frame and seismic behavior of the semi-rigid Khorjini connection for different cases are investigated and their results are compared. Finally, two special cases are presented and, furthermore, the connection mass effect on system frequency is investigated."

a new rotor position estimation method of ipmsm using all-pass filter on high-frequency rotating voltage signal injection,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>In this paper, a new rotor position estimation method of an interior permanent-magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) is proposed. It is motivated by a conventional sensorless control based on the high-frequency rotating voltage signal injection in the stationary reference frame, but extracts the rotor position information from the relation between injection voltages and induced currents in the high-frequency voltage model of an IPMSM. The rotor position can be directly calculated from currents obtained by transforming the rotation matrix in the stationary reference frame. It is also calculated by using the induced current envelope through the all-pass filter. Unlike the conventional heterodyning demodulation process, the proposed method provides the accurate rotor position information without a time delay of the rotor position by the band pass filter or low pass filter. Thus, the overall dynamic performance of IPMSM is enhanced by the accurate rotor position estimation than conventional methods.

A tuned mass damper (TMD) is placed in each blade, in the nacelle and on the spar to control the vibrations for these components. A Short Time Fourier Transform algorithm is used for semi-active control of the TMDs. The mathematical formulation of the integrated SFOWT-TMDs system is derived by using Euler-Lagrangian equations. The theoretical model derived is a time-varying system considering the aerodynamic properties of the blade, variable mass and stiffness per unit length, gravity, the interactions among the blades, nacelle, spar, mooring system and the TMDs, the hydrodynamic effects, the restoring moment and the buoyancy force. The aerodynamic loads on the nacelle and the spar due to their coupling with the blades are also considered. The effectiveness of the semi-active TMDs is investigated in the numerical examples where the mooring cable tension, rotor speed and the blade stiffness are varying over time. Except for excessively large strokes of the nacelle TMD, the semi-active algorithm is considerably more effective than the passive one in all cases and its effectiveness is restricted by the low-frequency nature of the nacelle and the spar responses."

In this paper, dynamic study of the vibration in PRP is discussed. In order to predict photo-deformation of the PRP a multiscale modeling is introduced which covers quantum level photo excitation, microscopic morphology, and macroscopic deformation of the PRP. A simple 1D beam model is introduced to model dynamic bending behavior of the PRP. Through fast Fourious transformation analysis, we identify that vibration frequency of the PRP can be controlled by light polarization angle."

data-driven scene parsing method for recognizing construction site objects in the whole image,2016,"['Construction site', 'Computer vision', 'Scene parsing', 'Object recognition', 'Label transfer']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Although efforts have been made for automated monitoring of construction sites, comprehensive understanding of a whole image remains to be a difficult task. Conventional vision-based monitoring methods have shortcomings in obtaining semantic information regarding an entire image because these methods are not scalable to the number of recognizable objects and training data. Most methods use a parametric model to recognize objects, involving cumbersome parameter tuning. This study presents the data-driven scene parsing method to recognize various objects in a construction site image. For identifying object information of a query image, the monitoring system retrieves the most relevant images to a query image using nearest neighbors and scale invariant feature transform flow matching and transfers relevant image labels to a query image. This study demonstrated the reasonable system performance in construction site images, recording 81.48% of average pixel-wise recognition rate with a small amount of similar images.

For the SCR catalyst in the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) substrate, beta zeolite (BEA) was used as the catalyst support and Cu as the main catalyst. In this case, copper (II) sulfate and copper (II) chloride were used as the Cu-precursors. A model gas reactor was used to evaluate the performance of the catalyst, and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometry was used to analyze the concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NO<SUB>x</SUB>), ammonia NH<SUB>3</SUB>, and other gases. The result from one experiment indicated that the NO<SUB>x</SUB> conversion of the fresh CuSO<SUB>4</SUB>-BEA catalyst was similar to that of the fresh CuCl<SUB>2</SUB>-BEA catalyst. However, after hydrothermal aging, the NO<SUB>x</SUB> conversion of the CuCl<SUB>2</SUB>-BEA catalyst was much higher than that of the CuSO<SUB>4</SUB>-BEA catalyst. These findings indicate that the CuCl<SUB>2</SUB>-BEA catalyst had outstanding durability, which was analyzed to verify the structure of the catalyst and its chemical changes.

study of a sudden qpo transition event in the black hole source xte j1550-564,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The transition of type B/A quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) is often associated with a sudden flux change at the peak of the outburst in black hole X-ray binaries. Recent studies show that these variations are connected to the jet ejection phenomenon in the inner regions of the accretion disk. One such event of the black hole source XTE J1550-564 is investigated, where a type A QPO transforms to type B in the first transition. In the second transition, a notable increase in the flux was observed in the 13-60 keV band. The dynamical energy-dependent power density spectrum and broadband energy spectrum obtained using the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data of this event were inspected to understand the energetics of the inner accretion disk. During these transitions, both disk and corona parameters were found to be varying along with their corresponding fluxes. We discuss the plasma ejection model scenario in the context of the first transition and the condensation of the corona in the inner region for the second transition event. Spectral results were used to derive the critical mass accretion rate, the amount of condensation, and the critical luminosity needed for the condensation process. We found the results to be in well agreement with theoretical simulations.</P>"
cosmological constraints from the redshift dependence of the alcock-paczynski effect: application to the sdss-iii boss dr12 galaxies,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>We apply the methodology developed in Li et al. to BOSS DR12 galaxies and derive cosmological constraints from the redshift dependence of the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect. The apparent anisotropy in the distribution of observed galaxies arise from two main sources, the redshift-space distortion (RSD) effect due to the galaxy peculiar velocities, and the geometric distortion when incorrect cosmological models are assumed for transforming redshift to comoving distance, known as the AP effect. Anisotropies produced by the RSD effect are, although large, maintaining a nearly uniform magnitude over a large range of redshift, while the degree of anisotropies from the AP effect varies with redshift by a much larger magnitude. We split the DR12 galaxies into six redshift bins, measure the two-point correlation function in each bin, and assess the redshift evolution of anisotropies. We obtain constraints of Omega(m) = 0.290 +/- 0.053, w = - 1.07 +/- 0.15, which are comparable with the current constraints from other cosmological probes such as SNe Ia, cosmic microwave background, and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO). Combining these cosmological probes with our method yield tight constraints of Omega(m) = 0.301 +/- 0.006, w = - 1.054 +/- 0.025. Our method is complementary to the other large-scale structure (LSS) probes like BAO and topology. We expect this technique will play an important role in deriving cosmological constraints from LSS surveys.</P>"

Modal analysis using the quasi-static deformation modes is chosen as a cost effective time domain simulation method and this is based on the fact that the structural response of the tank is quasi-static. Based on the developed cost effective time domain simulation method, the long-term fatigue analysis procedure for the structural details near the rolling chock and key of independent type tank is targeted to be established.

The fluid power converter has an effect akin to an electrical switched inductance transformer, wherein the output pressure or flow rate can be stepped up or down. Using an inductive reactance device (an inertia mass-block), the output flow and pressure can be varied to meet the load by a means that does not rely on dissipation of power (the resistance control). The simulation model based on the mathematics models of the components is built to analyse the performance of the fluid power converter. It is clearly shown that the fluid power converter has higher energy efficiency than conventional resistance control manners."
"amp-activated protein kinase activator, hl156a reduces thioacetamide-induced liver fibrosis in mice and inhibits the activation of cultured hepatic stellate cells and macrophages",2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Cirrhosis, the end-stage of hepatic fibrosis, is not only life-threatening by itself, but also a causative factor of liver cancer. Despite efforts to develop treatment for liver fibrosis, there are no approved agents as anti-fibrotic drugs to date. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the anti-fibrotic effect of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator, HL156A. A mouse model of thioacetamide (TAA)-induced liver fibrosis was used to examine the effect of HL156A in vivo. Mice received either TAA alone or a combination of TAA and HL156A intraperitoneally for a total duration of 6 weeks. Including HL156A during exposure to TAA significantly reduced extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and production of the hepatic transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-(beta 1). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the activation of hepatic stellate cells and the capillarization of liver sinusoids were also diminished significantly by HL156A co-treatment. The anti-fibrotic effect of HL156A was further studied in vitro by using a rat hepatic stellate cell line, HSC-T6 cells. The induction of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) by TGF-beta 1 treatment was reversed by HL156A, which was likely via the activation of AMPK. Moreover, HL156A showed anti-inflammatory effects on macrophages. Treatment with HL156A diminished LPS-induced activation of both Raw264.7 macrophage cells and primary cultured mouse macrophages. Taken together, these results imply that the AMPK activator HL156A inhibits hepatic fibrosis via multiple mechanisms and could be a potentially effective agent for fibrosis treatment.</P>"

This paper examines the implications of convergence on Christian scholarship, focusing on the relationship between science and religion. For this purpose, I will examine, first, how the discussions about convergence began in Korea. I will then briefly examine the relationship between science and religion, based on the four models - conflict, independence, dialogue and integration - suggested by Ian Barbour. I will discuss differences and similarities between convergence and the relationship between science and religion. I will also discuss the implications of the convergence trend worldwide in the long term on the relationship between science and Christianity, focusing on three issues - transhumanism, neuroscience and singularity. The converging trends in life science, neuroscience, artificial intelligence and nano-technology will make it possible to substantially transform the human body and mind in the not-too-distant future. Based on this possibility, transhumanism emerged, dreaming of creating a new humankind. Transhumanism deconstructs the conditions of being human defined by modern humanism and explores open possibilities of creating a new humankind. This will be a grave challenge to the Christian worldview. Rapid development of neuroscience, on the other hand, gives another serious challenge to the Christian concept of soul. Followers of neuroscience deny the existence of soul and claim there is no difference between human mind and machine mind. The development of artificial intelligence will surely be accelerated as a present pace of development suggests. As a result, the time of singularity will come, whereas artificial intelligence exceeds human intelligence. The followers of singularity are dreaming of the fusion of human mind and artificial intelligence, resulting the explosive development of a new intelligent being. According to this vision, human beings, after singularity, will emerge as an omniscient, omnipotent and living-forever being. Materialism lies behind all these radical visions, talking about reinventing human nature, rejecting the existence of soul and suggesting singularity. Materialism, taking advantage of science and technology in this age of science and technology, will remain as a real threat to the Christianity."

Especially unlike the spaces Pamuk transformed and created in his works of fiction, actual spaces were reflected in Istanbul: Memories and the City according to the autobiographical nature of the work, offering an advantage in a sense that the field investigations on the city can let people experience the literary spaces from the work more vividly.Various literary spaces in Istanbul are more than just spaces in Pamuk's novels; they are the spaces in which the author was born and has lived to date and which have been settings of his diverse works. Hence, making field investigations on various parts of the city described in his works is one of the ways to understand the past and future of the author and Istanbul.In programs for students, encouraging students to understand the author alongside the anthropogeographical traits of the region related to the author's work by appropriately arranging the author's biographical factors and the historical, literary, geographical, and cultural inheritance-related factors of the region should precede. For deepening and expanding knowledge in the course of education, it would be desirable for the lecturers and students to participate together in activities including planning, executing, and evaluating the field investigations on literary spaces.However, as the subject of this study, Istanbul, is a city in a foreign country—which means that visiting the region can be difficult for some students—development of teaching materials and aids for achieving similar effects without an actual field investigation is necessary. Overcoming the limitations of two-dimensional contents for literary education can only be possible through proposing and actively utilizing various models of educational contents in the sphere of the humanities by preparing contents from multiple angles. With that as the basis, inducing the combination of literary space resources in which literature and space are combined and culture industry will contribute to the development of culture industry in a comprehensive sense."

rhus verniciflua stokes attenuates cholestatic liver cirrhosis-induced interstitial fibrosis via smad3 down-regulation and smad7 up-regulation,2016,"['Rhus verniciflua Stokes', 'Cholestatic liver cirrhosis', 'Bile duct ligation']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Cholestatic liver cirrhosis (CLC) eventually proceeds to end-stage liver failure by mediating overwhelming deposition of collagen, which is produced by activated interstitial myofibroblasts. Although the beneficial effects of Rhus verniciflua Stokes (RVS) on various diseases are well-known, its therapeutic effect and possible underlying mechanism on interstitial fibrosis associated with CLC are not elucidated. This study was designed to assess the protective effects of RVS and its possible underlying mechanisms in rat models of CLC established by bile duct ligation (BDL). We demonstrated that BDL markedly elevated the serological parameters such as aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin, all of which were significantly attenuated by the daily uptake of RVS (2 mg/kg/day) for 28 days (14 days before and after operation) via intragastric route. We observed that BDL drastically induced the deterioration of liver histoarchitecture and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), both of which were significantly attenuated by RVS. In addition, we revealed that RVS inhibited BDL-induced proliferation and activation of interstitial myofibroblasts, a highly suggestive cell type for ECM production, as shown by immunohistochemical and semi-quantitative detection of a-smooth muscle actin and vimentin. Finally, we demonstrated that the anti-fibrotic effect of RVS was associated with the inactivation of Smad3, the key downstream target of a major fibrogenic cytokine, i.e., transforming growth factor b (TGF-b). Simultaneously, we also found that RVS reciprocally increased the expression of Smad7, a negative regulatory protein of the TGF-b/Smad3 pathway. Taken together, these results suggested that RVS has a therapeutic effect on CLC, and these effects are, at least partly, due to the inhibition of liver fibrosis by the downregulation of Smad3 and upregulation of Smad7."

The volume fraction of crystalline phase is stronglydependent on the cooling rate. The larger volume fraction of the crystalline phases results in the loweryield stress, the higher plastic strain, and the more pronounced work hardening behavior. At the crystallinevolume fraction below ~30%, the variation of the yield strength can be described by the rule of mixturemodel (ROM), while at the crystalline volume fraction higher than ~50% by the load-bearing model (LBM).At the crystal fractions between 30 and 50%, there is a yield strength drop and a transition from the ROMto the LBM. This transition is due to the formation of the crystalline structural framework at higher crystalfraction."
c-terminal-truncated hbv x promotes hepato-oncogenesis through inhibition of tumor-suppressive β-catenin/bambi signaling,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"C-terminal-truncated hepatitis B virus (HBV) X (HBx) (ctHBX) is frequently detected in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through HBV integration into the host genome. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying ctHBx-associated oncogenic signaling have not yet been clarified. To elucidate the biological role of ctHBx in hepato-oncogenesis, we functionally analyzed ctHBx-mediated regulation of the activin membrane-bound inhibitor bone morphogenetic protein and activin membrane-bound inhibitor (BAMBI) through transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) or β-catenin (CTNNB1) in HCC cells and in an animal model, and we compared its role to that of the full-length HBx protein. Ectopic ctHBx expression generated more colonies in anchorage-dependent and -independent growth assays than did HBx expression alone. ctHBx downregulated BAMBI to a greater degree than did HBx in HCC cells. HBx activated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which positively regulated the BAMBI expression through T-cell factor 1 signaling, whereas ctHBx negatively regulated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. BAMBI downregulated the β-catenin and TGF-β1 signaling pathways. TGF-β1 positively regulated BAMBI expression thorough Smad3 signaling.Furthermore, knockdown of BAMBI was more tumorigenic in HCC cells. Therefore, downregulation of both β-catenin and TGF-β1 signaling by BAMBI might contribute to tumor suppression in mice xenotransplanted with HepG2 or SH-J1 cells. Taken together, ctHBx may have a more oncogenic role than HBx through its inhibition of tumor-suppressive β-catenin/BAMBI signaling."

the rise of the internet of things and its potential impacts on consumers and society,2016,"['Internet of Things', 'digital culture', 'security participation', 'human experience']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Recently, a technical and technological term, the “Internet of Things,” became a buzzword in newspapers, government institutions, and in academe. The new technology is getting a response similar to that inspired by the emergence of groundbreaking technologies such as the Internet and Web 2.0. Journalists and policymakers are offering positive forecasts about how the Internet of Things (IoT) will transform our lives, businesses, and public services. Academic articles in engineering and business offer detailed technical and technological information and requirements and discuss possible new business models and the transformation of the industrial structure. Although it has been commercially introduced to markets for daily use, the rapid development of the technology suggests that more complex services and products will soon dominate the markets. Previous research and newspaper articles predict that this advance will be integrated into large parts of our lives and that its impacts on people will be enormous. Given that substantial effects on consumers and society are predicted, the lack of discussion about the issue is worrying. Therefore, we need to carefully examine the consumer and social impacts of the new technology instead of simply celebrating it. We thus explore concerns about the effects of IoT technology on consumers and society, drawing on critical studies of digital culture and the business and management literature. We find that there are three issues to consider in the age of IoT: security, individuality, and commodification. We argue that the development of IoT technology should be based on security for privacy, encouraging autonomy, and offering sovereignty to participants. Its development should not be about the security to govern, the subordination of people to the technology, or promoting corporate capitalism. We therefore conclude that a serious discussion about the impacts of IoT is needed in order to understand how it is going to shape our future."
surface acoustic wave propagation properties with zno thin film for thermo-electric sensor applications,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The frequency of surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices is decided by the width of the interdigital transducer fingers and the acoustic velocity of the piezoelectric substrate. Any change in the device can be easily detected as a frequency shift or amplitude difference by employing the delay line. In this study, we present a finite element modeling of SAW propagation properties with ZnO thin film for thermo-electric sensor applications. An SAW device is fabricated on an ST-X quartz piezoelectric substrate, where the propagating direction is towards the x-axis. The SAW sensor is designed aiming at a target frequency of 79 MHz. Afterwards, we carry out a comparative analysis of frequency characteristics based on a ZnO thin film for thermo-electric sensor applications. The applied temperature on the top of the ZnO thin film generates a voltage because of the thermo-electric properties of ZnO. Accordingly, the shape of the film also transforms by virtue of the piezoelectric properties of ZnO. Owing to a direct coupling between the thermo-electric and piezoelectric effects of ZnO thin film, the frequency peak splits from 79 MHz and a variation in amplitude is also observed.</P>"
a new stable and accurate algorithm of concrete crack image mosaic,2016,"['Image mosaic', 'Concrete crack', 'Harris corner', 'Image matching', 'Gradient information', 'Edge detector']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Due to the concrete crack images are self-similarity in the contents, it makes the matching procedure more difficult and unstable than the others. For the purpose of finding out the stable and accurate matching algorithm of concrete crack images, we give an analysis of different kinds of characters, such as, scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), local maximum gradient descriptor, Harris corners, and the maximum curvature points of the image edges, etc. Based on the experiments of different concrete crack images, a new stable matching algorithm is proposed in this paper. In our model, the edge information is combined with the local maximum gradient of the input matching images. After the extraction of the local maximum gradient character points, we use the edge information to divide these points into different classes. Then, the searching of the stable and accurate matching problem becomes to find out the best matching results which agree to the edge constraints. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more consistence and stable than the other kinds of matching algorithms especially in the proposing of sequential concrete crack images."
a study on hybrid encryption technique for digital contents of copyrights,2016,"['Digital Contents', 'Hybrid Encryption', 'Copyrights', 'Steganography']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The environment using multimedia information such as image, audio, and video is widely applied through the rapid development of the IT environment. The digital content industry applying this has been developed in a variety of forms. However, copyright is subjected to a serious threat as digital content is distributed in quantity with the spread of the Internet. Also, business model of companies is threatened largely by the variety of attacks such as illegal copy and transformation of digital content. In this paper, we propose a hybrid encryption in order to prevent copyright information damage by malicious attacks. The encryption process in two steps is performed in order to enhance hiding copyright in the proposed technique. The block encryption process is performs to prevent exposure and transformation of encrypted information after encryption performs using ARIA algorithm for copyright information. The encrypted copyright information like this improved robustness to several of attacks. The performance of the proposed technique is confirmed by experiments."

Visible near infrared spectroscopy, one of soil prediction methods, has been applied to predict several soil properties with effective costs, rapid and nondesctructive analysis, and satisfactory accuracy. Spectral preprocessing is a essential procedure to correct noisy spectra for visible near infrared spectroscopy. However, there are no attempts to evaluate various spectral preprocessing methods. We tested 5 different pretreatments, namely continuum removal, Savitzky-Golay filter, discrete wavelet transform, 1st derivative, and 2nd derivative to predict soil carbon(C) and nitrogen(N). Partial least squares regression was used for the prediction method. The total of 153 soil samples was split into 122 samples for calibration and 31 samples for validation. In the all range, absorption was increased with increasing C contents. Specifically, the visible region (650nm and 700nm) showed high values of the correlation coefficient with soil C and N contents. For spectral preprocessing methods, continuum removal had the highest prediction accuracy(Root Mean Square Error) for C(9.53mg/g) and N(0.79mg/g). Therefore, continuum removal was selected as the best preprocessing method. Additionally, there were no distinct differences between Savitzky-Golay filter and discrete wavelet transform for visual assessment and the methods showed similar validation results. According to the results, we also recommended Savitzky-Golay filter that is a simple pre-treatment with continuum removal."

Nevertheless, both the causes which give rise to new governance movement and the benefits which new governance would bring to the traditional government structure and regulatory regime, its deliberative and participatory device and process of enhancing transparency and accountability of the actors in decision-making, lead us to expect the possibility of new governance to transform traditional constitutional law and legal regime, even though new governance is not to be applied to every area of public policy and the concept of constitutional law and traditional legal regulation continue to be needed and take an important role in social change with new governance mechanism.New governance has been employed in policy making and administrative process of not only national, regional and local government but also international organization in its diverse forms including Korea. In modern states which can be characterized as democratic constitutional, administrative, and welfare state, new governance seeks participatory and deliberative democracy and has been expected to implement principle of democracy and rule of law(rechtsstaat principle) in more creative and flexible ways, and also it has been asserted that new governance has presented its possibility which active fundamental rights of the people might be more affirmatively and directly realized. However, the selection of the non-state actors to participate in and their decision through new governance program have revealed the problems and difficulties of fairness, transparency, and democratic legitimacy which are components of principle of democracy and rectsstaat as well. New governance, competing, supplementing and transforming traditional legal regulation as well as directed and limited by the latter and most of all, also allowed by constitutional law would bring new insight and ways to ensure democratic legitimacy and accountability of government in modern administrative government era.

Therefore, it is very important to analyze the characteristic of an eclogue that Cervantes identifies as his work`s genre. Cervantes esteemed writing poetry as a primary type of creative activity. Hence, he wished to write his work in the form of a poem, especially an eclogue which had a wide range of contemporaneous readership. The eclogue was a part of the typical classical genre, and it had a flexibility to incorporate other genres including prose. Many remarkable writers chose and wrote this genre as a part of their literary canon. Among these writers, Cervantes mainly modeled himself after Garcilaso de la Vega who had taken the Italian Renaissance poetry and transformed it into his own unique style. However, because of his lack of poetic talent, Cervantes could not write an authentic eclogue like the works of Garcilaso. Cervantes was a novelist, not a poet. As such, his genius as a novelist is amply displayed in his first novel. Betrayal, hatred, murder, et cetera: these negative elements that were hitherto not permitted in traditional pastoral novels add strong realism to Cervantes`s work. Hence La Galatea possesses dualism. The poetic part delivers the morals and the philosophical messages that the author wanted to impart. The prose, with its characteristic realism, brings amusement, vitality, and reality to those messages."

One of the mostly used tools are GPS instruments, which have been utilized in various combinations with accelerometers and some other conventional sensors. In the current study, observation series were recorded for 8 hours with GPS receivers (NovAtel) and Inclination Measurement Sensors mounted on a television tower in Istanbul, Turkey. Each series of observations collected from two different sensors were transformed into a single coordinate system (Local Topocentric Coordinates System). The positional changes of the tower were calculated from the GPS and the inclination data. These changes were plotted in two dimensions (2D) on the same graphic. Thus, the possibility of comparison and analysis were found using the data from both the GPS and the Inclinometer complement each other, in the real test area. The positional changes of the tower were modeled for further examination. As a result, the movement of the tower within an area of 1×1 cm2 was observed. Based on the results, it can be concluded that inclinometers can be used for monitoring the structural behavior of the tower."
implementation of time-efficient adaptive sampling function design for improved undersampled mri reconstruction,2016,"['Sampling function', 'Probability density function', 'Compressed sensing', 'MRI', 'Undersampling']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"To improve the efficacy of undersampled MRI, a method of designing adaptive sampling functions is proposed that is simple to implement on an MR scanner and yet effectively improves the performance of the sampling functions. An approximation of the energy distribution of an image (E-map) is estimated from highly undersampled k-space data acquired in a prescan and efficiently recycled in the main scan. An adaptive probability density function (PDF) is generated by combining the E-map with a modeled PDF. A set of candidate sampling functions are then prepared from the adaptive PDF, among which the one with maximum energy is selected as the final sampling function. To validate its computational efficiency, the proposed method was implemented on an MR scanner, and its robust performance in Fourier-transform (FT) MRI and compressed sensing (CS) MRI was tested by simulations and in a cherry tomato. The proposed method consistently outperforms the conventional modeled PDF approach for undersampling ratios of 0.2 or higher in both FT-MRI and CS-MRI. To fully benefit from undersampled MRI, it is preferable that the design of adaptive sampling functions be performed online immediately before the main scan. In this way, the proposed method may further improve the efficacy of the undersampled MRI."
concurrency control method to provide transactional processing for cloud data management system,2016,"['Transaction', 'Cloud Data Management', 'Snapshot Isolation']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"As new applications of cloud data management system (CDMS) such as online games, cooperation edit, social network, and so on, are increasing, transaction processing capabilities for CDMS are required.

Some of them provide limited transaction processing capabilities. Some of them are hard to be integrated with existing CDMSs. In this paper, we proposed a new concurrency control method to support transaction processing capability for CDMS to solve these problems. The proposed method was designed and implemented based on Spark, an in-memory distributed processing framework. It uses RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) model to provide fault tolerant to data in the main memory. In our proposed method, database stored in CDMS is loaded to main memory managed by Spark. The loaded data set is then transformed to RDD. In addition, we proposed a multi-version concurrency control method through immutable characteristics of RDD.

An integrative review of recent research is conducted in the following ways, focusing on service quality and customer satisfaction.  First, this study examines recent developments in the conceptualization and measurement of service quality and customer satisfaction and probes the theoretical frameworks. Although SERVQUAL and SERVPERF are two representative models for measuring service quality, KS-SQI (Korean-standard Service Quality Model) has been developed and reliably used as a unique and representative model in Korea. On the other hand, KSCI and NCSI are popular models for measuring customer satisfaction in Korea.  Second, the study investigates the effects of service quality and customer satisfaction on firm performance and discusses their effectiveness. Many studies have shown that customer satisfaction has significant effects on the profitability and value of firms. Empirical results also reveal that customer satisfaction has a dynamic effect on firm performance in terms of carryover effects over time.  Third, after scrutinizing the definitions and types of customer loyalty as well as the determinants of customer-oriented loyalty programs, this study suggests practical implications for managers. Specifically, researchers have made a conceptual distinction between true loyalty and spurious loyalty, and studies show that two types of loyalty yield different consequences. Several studies have also investigated how to design loyalty programs in order to attain customer loyalty.   Finally, future research directions are discussed by integrating theoretical developments and emerging research trends. It is suggested that more attention should be paid to customer dysfunctional behavior, side effects of reward programs, transformative service, technological advances, and customer affect."

In this method, we adopted vector median filter (VMF) to process the tomato images to eliminate noise and make the images more smooth firstly. To avoid the effects of natural environment illumination to the vision system, we processed tomato images and obtained the tomato illumination irrelevant images according to color constancy algorithm of the single pixel. Secondly, we segmented illumination irrelevant images using OSTU method, separated multiple objects by a watershed algorithm based on distance transform and got the target area with mathematical morphology. Also we extracted color, shape and textural features of the ripe tomatoes. Finally, we did experiments on recognizing tomatoes using support vector machine (SVM) with different kernel functions. At the same time, in order to obtain optimal model of SVM, we adopted cross validation and grid search method to optimize the model parameters. The experiment results show that illumination irrelevant processing not only can eliminate the influence of light intensity, but save a gray transferring step for further image segmentation. SVM with radial basis function is better than other kernel functions SVM and the tomato recognition accuracy is 95.7%. Through optimizing the parameter C and r of radial basis function, the tomato recognition accuracy reaches up to 96.9% with the increase of 1.2% when C and r is 4 and 16 respectively. This proves that it's feasible and effective to optimize SVM's parameters by cross validation and grid search method, which provide foundation for further research on vision system of tomato picking robots."

The analysis included (1) exploratory nonlinear analysis, (2) estimation of flexion points and slopes at below and above the points. In the model to estimate risk of incidence of stroke, we controlled for conventional risk factors such as age, sex, systolic blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, tri-glyceride, and smoking status. Results: The relationship between incidence of stroke and log-transformed 1-acetyl-2-formyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocho-line was non-linear with flexion point around intensity score of 8.8, whereas other metabolites, log-transformed Acetylcholine and HexadecylAcetylGlyc-erol, showed negative linear patterns. Conclusions: The study suggests that metabolic markers are associated with incidence of stroke, particularly, at or above the flexion point. The study result may contribute to developing a novel system for precise stroke prediction."

This study investigates the use of clamshells as a natural calcium resource. Highly soluble powdered calcium lactate (LCCL) was prepared from the calcined powdered shells of littleneck clams (LCCP) using response surface methodology (RSM) to predict optimum conditions. These conditions, as derived from pH, solubility, and yield of 11 LCCLs manufactured according to the RSM model, were 1.80 M lactic acid and 1.13 M LCCP. The actual values of pH (6.98), solubility (93.99%), and yield (351.23%) under the optimized conditions were as predicted. The derived LCCL exhibited a strong buffering capacity in the range of pH 2.78-3.90 when combined with less than 2 mL of 1 N HCl. The ranges of calcium content and solubility of LCCL were 7.7-17.5 g/100 g and 96.6-98.9%, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) of the LCCL identified it as calcium lactate pentahydrate, and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) revealed an irregular and rod-like microstructure. These results confirm the potential use of clamshells, converted to highly soluble organic acid calcium, as an additive to enhance calcium content in food ingredients."

North Korea is sticking to a unique socialist system, but has been internationally isolated because it is pursuing a nuclear-economy as an advance policy. There is an enormous gap between South and North Korea in their respective international competitive power and status. For analysis on the possibility of a North Korean transition to a market economy and its limitations, when a clear approach to the phenomena in the socialist system of North Korea and correlation theory are combined, actual results can be obtained. With respect to past transition models to market economies by socialist countries, Russia, China, and Vietnam are important representative countries which transformed from a planned economies to market economies. As for the possibility of a similar transition in North Korea, because of the UN`s continued restraints against North Korea and the worsening international isolation, the initial signs of a market economy are appearing bit by bit in the border areas between North Korea and China and between North Korea and Russia. The city of Pyeongyang is considered a city with better development, and the planned economy led by the government is getting weaker in important local cities because of activated markets and the initial signs of a market economy are increasing. However, limitations of the transition of the North Korean system into a market economy include lack of certainty and confidence by political elites, their experience, international exchange, and the nuclear-economy in parallel with the advance policy, which will require a long time to overcome. For a successful transition to a market economic system, the North Korean government should be aware of the necessity of improvement in related market institutions."
a new method combining qfd with intuitionistic fuzzy sets for web services selection,2016,"['QFD', 'Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets', 'QoS', 'web service']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"With the rapidly increasing number of Web services, the consumers have to choose suitable service from a wealth of web services according to the comprehensive factors. QoS is an important criteria to assess whether the consumer’s requirements are met by web service. But the QoS attributes offered by many web service suppliers are uncertain, especially the non-functional QoS attributes. In this paper, in view of the uncertain QoS attributes in the process of selecting web services, presents the method of selecting web service on basis of QFD-IFS (Quality Function Deployment- Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets). Describe the consumer’s requirements and QoS attributes with intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Construct the QFD model transforming requirements of consumer into QoS attributes, which gives comprehensive consideration to the relations between requirements of consumer and QoS attributes, and to the impact of the correlation between the QoS attributes on the weights of QoS attributes. After the modified intuitionistic fuzzy entropy is used to obtain the entropy weights of the QoS attributes and alternatives. In the end an example show that the proposed method is feasible and effective."
taint inference for cross-site scripting in context of url rewriting and html sanitization,2016,"['Taint inference', 'cross-site scripting', 'URL rewriting', 'HTML sanitization', 'bioinformatics']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Currently, web applications are gaining in prevalence. In a web application, an input may not be appropriately validated, making the web application susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS), which poses serious security problems for Internet users and websites to whom such trusted web pages belong. A taint inference is a type of information flow analysis technique that is useful in detecting XSS on the client side. However, in existing techniques, two current practical issues have yet to be handled properly. One is URL rewriting, which transforms a standard URL into a clearer and more manageable form. Another is HTML sanitization, which filters an input against blacklists or whitelists of HTML tags or attributes. In this paper, we make an analogy between the taint inference problem and the molecule sequence alignment problem in bioinformatics, and transfer two techniques related to the latter over to the former to solve the aforementioned yet-to-be-handled-properly practical issues. In particular, in our method, URL rewriting is addressed using local sequence alignment and HTML sanitization is modeled by introducing a removal gap penalty. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method."

Through the analysis, it becomes clear that there are two significant features. First, the trend of regional policy has been changed from Government led plan such as industrial development and infrastructure improvement to Local autonomy focusing on regional power revitalization. Second, policy evaluation, sharing efficient models and partnership with local NPO and volunteers have promoted to enact new regional policy in this period. Especially under the rule of Koizumi Junichiro, these transformations of regional policies were accelerated. This analysis reveals the context why the thought of regional independence spread so quickly and suggests that the relationship between central government and local government has been changed structurally in this period."
defining dusun identity in brunei,2016,"['Brunei Darussalam', 'Brunei Dusuns', 'Malaynization', 'ethnic identity']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This qualitative study was designed to explore the definition of ethnic identity of the Dusuns in Brunei Darussalam from the perspective of Shamsul A.B.’s (1996) “everyday-defined” social reality. The purpose of this study was twofold. Firstly, by employing Phinney’s (1996) formulation of ethnic identity, this study examined the existence of core components of ethnic identity, namely, ethnic self-identification, ethnic involvement, positive attitude towards ethnic group, and sense of belonging in the life of the Dusuns. Secondly, by utilizing Phinney’s (1996) three-stage model of ethnic identity formation, this study investigated the relationship between core components and the formation process of ethnic identity. Twenty-six Dusun informants ranging in age from 8 to 80 years old were interviewed for the purpose of this study. The analysis of the interview data revealed that all core components exist and evolve in the life of the Dusuns. Different perspectives towards core components can also be identified across different age groups. Adult informants contested the relevance of ethnic involvement in view of socio-cultural transformations that occurred within the ethnic group, whereas younger Dusuns were not able to extend sense of belonging outside their family. These findings lead to the identification of family and historical contexts as influential factors that shape the ways the informants experienced the ethnic identity components.Further, the findings of this study indicate the relationship between core components and the formation process of ethnic identity. Sense of belonging and community is only evident in the experience of older informants, sufficient to help them reach the stage of achieving ethnic identity. This also shows a positive sequential relation between the stages in Phinney’s ethnic identity model and the age of the informants. Interestingly, evidence on internalized sense of belonging reveals the fact that an individual could still attain ethnic identity achievement even without experiencing all components of ethnic identity. Once again, this study suggests contextual factors play a role in the stage progression of the Dusuns’ ethnic identity."

Specifically, it analyzes the shifts in North Korea`s SEZ policy in three different aspects-North Korea`s unique territorial logic, stress on decentralization, and comparison with Chinese reform and opening-up. Based upon this analysis, this paper criticizes a linear approach to understand North Korea`s economic transformation from isolation to opening-up, and explores the dynamics of North Korea SEZ strategy in various dimensions. It contends that North Korea`s SEZ strategy is neither an inevitable choice from economic difficulty nor an adoption of Chinese model of reform and opening up.

Firstly, She was called the ‘educated woman’ who well trained her children at home as Lee, Yulgok’s mother in order to argue the necessity of education of women. Secondly, Saimdang encountered the discourses on ‘a wise mother and good wife’ and was invented as a traditional and ideal woman, that is a wise mother and good wife in 1930s. There were historical contexts regarding the critiques of western modernity, nostalgic moods of past, and disgust of so-called ‘new woman’. Lastly, She was spent as the symbol of ‘militaristic mother’ and ‘woman in the rear ground’(銃後婦人). It was naturally colonialistic appropriation which stems from national demanding of women. These discoursive representations of Shin, Saimdang were connected with political context at that time and Those were the politics reinforcing gender roles. In short, the images of Shin, Saimdang were reconstructed according to national or colonialist demanding. Futhermore, Shin, Saimdang dicourses together with ‘new women’ discourses have reinforced gender identities in colonial Korea. In particular, the discourses on ‘new women’ continued to ‘après-girl’ or ‘Madame Freedom’ dicourses in 1950s and ‘Doenjang girls’[soy bean paste girls] dicourses in contemporary days."

an enhanced qam-fbmc scheme with interference mitigation,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Cyclic prefixed orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CP-OFDM) has been used as a waveform for mobile communications, but CP-OFDM has weaknesses in an asynchronous heterogeneous network scenario. To overcome the disadvantage of CP-OFDM, a quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)-filter-bank-based multi-carrier (FBMC) system is proposed to achieve superior spectrum confinement and better spectral efficiency. However, QAM-FBMC has inevitable performance degradation because of interferences from non-orthogonal filters. In this letter, we propose a decision feedback equalization (DFE)-based interference mitigation scheme for the QAM-FBMC system to cancel a residual interference. The interference from the filters of QAM-FBMC influences to other subcarriers and symbols, and it is modeled as an end-to-end system transfer function with para-Hermitian polynomial matrix form, equivalently. By spectral factorization of the system transfer function, the system response is transformed into causal, and the receiver detects the symbols successively. This letter describes the spectral factorization method and formulates the feed-forward and feedback filter of the DFE structure with the spectral factor of transfer function. Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed scheme to the conventional QAM-FBMC receiver scheme.</P>"

Therefore with uncertainty and complexity in radically changing modern society to meet the individual desire for change at higher level a new flexible and proactive leadership style is needed. Another crucial business for the organization would be individual attitude toward his own organization. This empirical study has made an analysis on the relationship between job satisfaction and organizational commitment of transformation and transactional leadership among the subjects at small and medium-sized rms located in Kwang-Ju and South Jeolla province. The purpose of this study is to lay out an approach on the role of a leadership for the organizational objective, the impact of leadership on the relationship between leadership styles and organizational performance. Firstly, the analysis on the relationship between leadership styles and job satisfaction has shown that, for the individuals to feel job satisfaction in his workplace, the leader should have a strong conviction with his self-assuredness, faith, and moral fairness, granting each member condence, stimulating them to achieve higher-level desire so as to have strong motivation for their loy goals. In the meanwhile, if the leaders and team players are rewarded, the higher the level of their job satisfaction and performance will become. Secondly, this also had investigated the studies on leadership styles and organizational commitment and found that the modern organization members showed lower gures in organizational commitment, moral uprightness, and aective & emotional attachment. Also it was proposed that the transactional leadership styles nd it hard to have the members committed to the organization. The arts of compromise, obedience and negotiation will be key elements for this leader. Therefore the leaders’ creative and reformative ability will have each member to have autonomy and sense of independence, leading them to develop themselves open-minded. Thirdly, a good leader should know how to work on individual characteristics, for each individual may have different impact on the performance. It was discussed that he now only has to know how to handle their vision development encouraging them to better produce rationalized and creative perspective, but to decide if they need reward intervention in-between. In summary, it is proposed that the leaders should acknowledge the importance of leadership in managing job satisfaction and organizational commitment. In other words, a leader combines the knowledge of developing vision, encouraging the team players, treating them fairly and at times dierently according to their performance.

It also helped Labour transform itself towards a sound pragmatic center-left party in British politics seeking for ‘social-ism.’ On the other hand, Thatcherism brought about a harsh and divisive society in which the level of both economic and regional inequalities was exacerbated. Even with such dual aspects of Thatcherist legacies, Thatcher and Thatcherism transformed not only the structure of British society and British people’s life but also the way of their working.

A variety of Wilber’s writings and studies on gender conducted by the Integral Community were reviewed. The literature review centers on Wilber’s perspective on feminism, the consciousness of sex and gender, typology of ego development. Integral feminism expands women’s experiences and gender identities to transpersonal development beyond pre-personal and personal aspects. The author developed an integral map on gender and feminism using an all quadrant all level (AQAL) model of integral feminism. The integral theory explains gender in the context of the consciousness development of humankind and individuals. From this perspective, gender and gender identities, which have been constructed in modern society is expected to be transcended as society evolves into a post-modernism phase. Individuals are expected to have transpersonal consciousness of gender accompanied by de-identifying with all traits along with psychological and spiritual development. Gender typology requires sensitive insights into a process and influences of forming differences as it has political implications and influence on individual development, which is different from other typologies. In order for integral feminism to offer a more detailed map and clinical implications, it needs to incorporate a perspective from feminist counseling that addresses women’s issues based on cultural, social, and political contexts, focusing on gender and power. Feminist epistemology and feminist counseling techniques, such as a gender analysis and a power analysis, are beneficial to understand the close relationships among four quadrants. The spectrum theory that includes transpersonal aspects of human consciousness development and the integral theory that emphasizes the transformation of social systems along with individual psychology for consciousness development would benefit to found transpersonal feminist counseling."
uio-66-type metal–organic framework with free carboxylic acid: versatile adsorbents via h-bond for both aqueous and nonaqueous phases,2016,"['free carboxylic acid', 'H-bond', 'isophthalic acid', 'liquid-phase adsorption', 'metal&#x2212']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The metal organic framework (MOP) UiO-66 was synthesized in one step from zirconium chloride and isophthalic acid (IPA), together with the usual link material, terephthalic acid (TPA). UiO-66 with free -COOH can be obtained in a facile way by replacing up to 30% of the TPA with IPA. However, the chemical and thermal stability of the synthesized MOFs decreased with increasing IPA content used in the syntheses, suggesting an increase in the population of imperfect bonds in the MOFs because of the asymmetrical structure of IPA. The obtained MOFs with free -COOH were applied in liquid-phase adsorptions from both water and model fuel to not only estimate the potential applications but also confirm the presence of -COOH in the MOFs. The adsorbed amounts of several organics (triclosan and oxybenzone from water and indole and pyrrole from fuel) increased monotonously with increasing IPA content applied in MOF synthesis (or -COOH in the MOFs). The favorable contribution of free -COOH to adsorption can be explained by H-bonding, and the direction of H-bonds (adsorbates: H donor; MOFs: H acceptor) was confirmed by the adsorption of oxybenzone in a wide pH range. The versatile applications of the MOFs with -COOH in adsorptions from both polar and nonpolar phases are remarkable considering that hydrophobic and hydrophilic adsorbents are generally required for water and fuel purification, respectively. Finally, the presence of free -COOH in the MOFs was confirmed by liquid-phase adsorptions together with general Fourier transform infrared analyses and decreased chemical and thermal stability.</P>"

In order to solve this problem, it proposed that Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) should be responsible for the commissioning process at a local level. Following the consultation process, from October 2014 PCCs become responsible for the commissioning of victim services. As a result of the PCCs’ responsibilities for the commissiong of victims’ services, a number of different models have subsequently been developed across England and Wales. In 2013, Victims’Code was also revised to transform the criminal justice system by putting victims first, making the system more responsive and easier to navigate. It sets a minimum standard for the services that must be provided to victims of crime by organisation in England and Wales. These reformed victim policies in England and Wales can be important references in the preparation of establishing a new action plan for protection and support for victims in Korea."

However, the mainland Chinese are more likely than the Taiwanese to approve of women working for pay, and less likely to feel that women should adopt a solely domestic role, whereas the Taiwanese are more likely than the Chinese to approve of women both working outside the home and staying at home. The results of a multinomial logit model demonstrate the gap in gender-role attitudes on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to be most pronounced in the oldest cohorts. The differing trajectories of the socioeconomic transformation in the two societies explain the differences in their gender-role attitudes."

To do this, real-time tracking algorithm is proposed for objects navigate and identify current positions and movements, because each object has a color with label on top. RGB color space is used to calculate the threshold values of each color. It is for example, video surveillance applications where cameras and other sources of information are used to monitor the activities of a sensitive site. Threshold values can be defined according to the object to track. Linear model is applied to the color discrimination. To remove unwanted objects to executives, morphological transformation is applied on the image binary and technical Blob analysis is then used to facilitate the detection of object. Our proposed algorithm is capable of tracking objects in the format full-frame (640 x 480 pixels) at rate (50 images per second). High performance robustness and in real time is confirmed by experiments."

Then, we simulate plastic behavior by using the calculated forming force data as the forming force input to ANSYS, a commercial structure finite element analysis program. We calculate the forming force data by using the model shape in MAXWELL, a commercial electromagnetic finite element analysis program. We repeat the process until the current is fully discharged by the formed coil. Our results can be used to reduce the error in data transformation with a reduced number of data transformations, because the proposed approach directly links the electromagnetic analysis and the structural analysis after removing the step of the numerical analysis of a graph describing the forming force, unlike the existing electromagnetic forming process. Second, it is possible to simulate a more realistic forming force by keeping a certain distance between nodes using the re-mesh function during the repeated analysis until the current is completely discharged by the formed coil, based on the MAXWELL results. We compare and review the results of the EFPA using the peak value of the forming force that acts on the workpiece (which is the existing analysis method), and the proposed phased EFPA over time approach."

In order to resolve key escrow problem, a new technique – Identifier Discrimination is proposed in this paper for composing private keys for entities in hierarchy. With the technique, an identity selective secure HIBE scheme is constructed under Decisional Bilinear Diffie- Helleman (DBDH) assumption in standard security model, in which any identity is incapable of deriving private keys for any of its descendants with use of its private key, and the privilege of generating private keys for each individual descendant is delegated by the root PKG through authorization, that we call Authorization Delegation. Moreover, a new hierarchical identity based signature (HIBS) scheme is constructed from our HIBE construction, by applying Naor transformation of an identity-based signature (IBS) out of an IBE. Because of the inability of deriving its descendants’ private keys with use its private key, an entity therefore cannot sign messages on behalf of any of its descendants, thus guaranteeing that authenticity and non-repudiation properties are achieved in our HIBS system."

Unlike capitalist welfare aiming at correcting market results socialist welfare has been proposed to satisfy people’s basic needs, but it had operated as instrument of dictatorship. Relation between welfare and dictatorship could be distinguished as hard exchange and soft one in line with social construction of welfare. Welfare-dictatorship relation in East Germany had developed from its formation(1949-1970s), crisis(1980s) and dissolution(1989-1990). There had established hard exchange relation in which the legitimacy of dominance had debted to welfare as social rights. While crisis of the exchange relation had been modest in a form of insufficient supply of consumption goods, it was one of the elements of collapse of dictatorship, leading to the unification with West Germany. The journey of the exchange relation in North Korea can be characterized by its formation(1948-1980), crisis(1990s-2000s), and transformation(2010s). Unlike East Germany, welfare was socially constructed as gift form the ruler to the ruled, which made the combination of welfare and dictatorship loosely coupled. Although economic crisis was severe compared to East German one the rulers have succeeded maintaining dictatorial dominance by creating dual exchange relation. They separated core group and subordinated one supporting the former at the expense of the latter. They blocked out most of the people from soft exchange relation making bad use of muddling-through life style dependent on market activities. This strategy led to a ’dictatorship neutral welfare extinction’. Taking the high degree of institutionalization of newly establishing welfare-dictatorship relation into account, lives of most people are hardly expected to be improved by gift by their rulers even if North Korean economy will recover in the future."

Given this significance of collaborative governance approach, this paper examines the Daesungdong Community Project in the city of Paju, especially focusing on how their community building governance has been structured and processed. The case study shows that in those special areas, the role of central and local government was very critical in initiating the community-building project. The national government took a role of network broker or civic enabler, which facilitated the effective mobilization of human and material resources within/beyond the community. In particular, the case demonstrates the transformation of the government-initiated community=building governance to a civic participatory model, where diverse actors in civil society and their collective intelligence made a meaningful contribution."

The BST microparticles were successfully prepared for DPIs by spray drying from feeding solution concentrations of 1%, 3%, and 5% (w/v) and by jet milling at grinding pressures of 2, 3, and 4 MPa. The physicochemical properties of the spray-dried (SD) and jet-milled (JM) microparticles were determined via scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, dynamic light scattering particle size analysis, Karl Fischer titration, surface analysis, pycnometry, differential scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The in vitro aerosol dispersion performance and drug dissolution behavior were evaluated using an Anderson cascade impactor and a Franz diffusion cell, respectively. The JM microparticles exhibited an irregular corrugated surface and a crystalline solid state, while the SD microparticles were spherical with a smooth surface and an amorphous solid state. Thus, the in vitro aerosol dispersion performance and dissolution behavior as DPIs were considerably different due to the differences in the physicochemical properties of the SD and JM microparticles. In particular, the highest grinding pressures under jet milling exhibited excellent aerosol dispersion performance with statistically higher values of 56.8%±2.0% of respirable fraction and 33.8%±2.3% of fine particle fraction and lower mass median aerodynamic diameter of 5.0±0.3 μm than the others (<I>P</I><0.05, analysis of variance/Tukey). The drug dissolution mechanism was also affected by the physicochemical properties that determine the dissolution kinetics of the SD and JM microparticles, which were well fitted into the Higuchi and zero-order models, respectively.</P>"

In this regard, high-Mn, Li-rich oxides (HMLOs; xLi(2)MnO(3) (1 - x) LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 at x > 0.5) warrant an in-depth study because of their good cyclic performance at high operating voltages and potentially large specific capacities. Here, to understand the synergistic effects and enhanced cyclic stability of HMLOs, mechanically blended HMLO (m-HMLO) and chemically bonded HMLO (c-HMLO) were prepared and investigated. c-HMLO exhibits relatively high reaction voltages, large specific capacities, and enhanced cyclic stabilities (similar to 99%) at a high operating voltage (similar to 4.8 V vs. Li/Li+) compared with m-HMLO. First-principles calculations with electronic structure analysis were performed using an atomic model developed by Rietveld refinement using as-synthesised c-HMLO. The redox mechanisms of Ni, Co, and Mn ions were determined via the partial density of states of the ground states predicted using the cluster expansion method, which elucidates that LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 stabilises the transition metal (TM) layer of Li2MnO3 and separates Li delithiation potentials in Li2MnO3 in the HMLO. Kinetic analyses including electronic structures revealed that the interlayer migration of TMs from the TM layer to the Li layer depends on the crystal field stabilisation. Thus, TMs with reduced character in the tetrahedral sites than the octahedral sites owing to the effects of crystal field stabilisation, such as Ni ions, in HMLOs would face a higher interlayer migration barrier, impeding phase transformation into spinel phases. Furthermore, Cu ions could constitute a doping source for HMLOs to improve the material's cyclic stability through this mechanism. These characteristics may be widely applied to explain experimental phenomena and improve the properties of cathode materials for Li-ion batteries.</P>"

Tracing the Buddha’s historic actions seems to not have been a concern at Bharhut; the limited choice of life events and their lack of narrative specificity suggest that a rigorous, sequential and historical life story of Shakyamuni was yet to be codified. From the sculpture decorating the gates of the Sanchi stupa dating to the 1stcentury BCE ca., it appears that worshippers began to relate in different ways to the figure of Shakyamuni; his presence was made tangible not only through images of devotion and symbolic allusion to his physical body but also through depictions of his actual actions.In the narrative art of the northwestern region of Gandhara during the Kushan period (1st-3rd CE) emerges a strong interest in depicting a cohesive life centered on the actions of the physical Buddha. The Buddha at this time started to be represented in human form, and his life became a spiritual biography and not a simple succession of actions. In Gandharan narratives, the temporality of life and the universality of myth were always intertwined to become a viable model for all to follow. The life scenes were depicted on small stupas and were viewed by devotees in chronological order as they walked around such monuments. The conceptual transformation that the life of the Buddha underwent in this region is comparable to the one that would take place in a dramatic adaptation of the narration, and it is possible that Buddhist drama may have played a role in these artistic developments.  The narrative emphasis appears irrelevant in the contemporary Buddhist art from the Mathura region in North India.  Three-dimensional sculptures representing the Buddha are made throughout the vast Kushan territory, however, the images from Mathura seem also to betray slightly different treatments and views of the Buddha’s body; it is especially in Gandhara that we notice a strong link between Buddhist icons and actual Buddhist relics."

Bergson affirms the invention, not as the mechanical fabrication, but as related with the creation of Life, on the basis of Metaphysics of Life. On the other hand, Simondon universalizes the invention both as a transductive operation for the problem-solving and as a capability of the relationship and communication, on the basis of Individuation Theory. Though Simondon criticizes Bergson on the dichotomous frame(between nature and technology, life and matter) and anthropological-pragmatic thinking of technology, he elevates the concept of invention to the status of a paradigm of information technology, by transductively using those conceptual tools(problem-solving, abstract-concrete, intuition, continuity-discontinuity, leap, etc.) provided by Bergson. The two philosophers’ ontological, psychological and sociological considerations of the invention, including the analyses of the operational principles of inventive imagination, the pedagogical values and an active role of the invention for the social transformations, reveal themselves as model cases of a philosophical analysis by which the existing approaches of Sociology of Technology and Cultural History about the invention can be complemented."

The gravity satellites, such as GRACE and GOCE, have already implemented their gradient measurements for recovering the accurate gravity of the Earth and its temporal variation due to mass changes on the subsurface. However, the magnetic gradients have little been applied since Swarm launched. A localized magnetic modeling method is useful in taking an account for a region where data availability was limited or of interest was special. In particular, computation to get the localized solutions is much more efficient and it has an advantage of presenting high frequency anomaly features with numbers of solutions fewer than the global ones. Besides, these localized basis functions that were done by a linear transformation of the spherical harmonic functions, are orthogonal so that they can be used for power spectrum analysis by transforming the global spherical harmonic coefficients. I anticipate in scientific and technical progress in the localized modeling with the gradient measurements from Swarm and here will do discussion on the results of the localized solution to represent the three vector and six gradient anomalies over the Antarctic area from the synthetic data derived from a global solution of the spherical harmonics for the crustal magnetic anomalies of Swarm measurements."
educators as learners: role in social curation systems,2016,"['Social Curation System', 'Learners', 'Contextualizer']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Now is the time to think about how to process information. Users need to know that there are filters to help them pick out the expanding information in quantity. The key is the ``Social Curation System``. A curator is a content specialist responsible for educational collections and is involved with the contextualization of materials. Social curation system is a service that filters massive information according to one``s own motivation and designs the filtered information for sharing. It is believed that using social curation system as a teaching and learning tool would not only enable learners to change their roles but also raise the contextualization of information. This study aims to make clear differences between social curation systems(SCSs) and existing online learning systems, discuss what the main roles of an educator and a curator are, and research what we should do for educational usage of SCSs. Models of SCSs are different from existing learning platforms. The main difference is clarity of roles between educators and learners. In the SCS``s environments, these include the aspect of original platforms. In addition, the function of curating allows an autonomous system. Curated massive information can be great contents that promote the composition of Learning Community. These conative groups are connected and interact with each other frequently. It seems like a gap between the two dimensions and three dimensions. Effective roles of the educator as a learner are classified as finder, filterer, contextualizer and sharer. First, Finder as the learner (Educator) collects useful information from various media. Second, learner categorizes scraps of information as per purpose of learning. Third, categorized information is born by one of the educational media through the contextualization of learner. Fourth, learner posts those contents. Another learner reprocesses and transforms what they have. Also, all of this process can be possible in the learning community``s relationship. Occasionally, contextualizing is the most necessary in the way that roles make higher reliability regarding curated contents. Lastly, I offer three suggestions according to the literatures review about advanced educational usage of SCSs. There needs to be management of integrated system for education and surveillants who monitor mistakes such as copyright problems and combining SCSs and off-line learning."
cooperative data scheduling in hybrid vehicular ad hoc networks: vanet as a software defined network,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>This paper presents the first study on scheduling for cooperative data dissemination in a hybrid infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication environment. We formulate the novel problem of cooperative data scheduling (CDS). Each vehicle informs the road-side unit (RSU) the list of its current neighboring vehicles and the identifiers of the retrieved and newly requested data. The RSU then selects sender and receiver vehicles and corresponding data for V2V communication, while it simultaneously broadcasts a data item to vehicles that are instructed to tune into the I2V channel. The goal is to maximize the number of vehicles that retrieve their requested data. We prove that CDS is NP-hard by constructing a polynomial-time reduction from the Maximum Weighted Independent Set (MWIS) problem. Scheduling decisions are made by transforming CDS to MWIS and using a greedy method to approximately solve MWIS. We build a simulation model based on realistic traffic and communication characteristics and demonstrate the superiority and scalability of the proposed solution. The proposed model and solution, which are based on the centralized scheduler at the RSU, represent the first known vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) implementation of software defined network (SDN) concept.</P>"

Firstly, Apel’s attempt to dissolve the question ‘Why be moral’ by a transcendental-pragmatic reflection is not successful, since it is not clear whether this kind of existential question can be answered by philosophical argument. Secondly, Apel’s argument that universally valid moral norms as indispensable preposition in communicative praxis can be discovered by transcendental-pragmatic reflection is flawed because it is based on a confustion of purposive-rational rules and moral norms. Moreover, Apel can answer the question ‘Why these presuppostions, not others?’ only by appealing to a kind of philosophilcal reflection which is not strict enough to vindicate a claim of necessary truth. Apel refutes Albert’s anti-foundatinalist argument is based on pragmatic contradiction by the concept of pragmatic contradiction. But since it is possible to transform Apel’s argument to one which is not based on the concept of pragmatic contradiction, it is not clear whether his position really overcomes Albert’s munchhausen trilemma. Thirdly, Apel’s claim that a unanimous rational agreement by participants of discource can construct and justify valid moral norms is flawed with unrealizability because it assimilates the model of communicative community aimed at reflection on practical problems to scientist community reflecting on truth claim. These critical assessments can give, if valid, a reason to reconsider the foundationalist project based on the logic of transcendental pragmatics."

Long-term oxidative stress is linked with chronic diseases including breast, prostate, and lung cancers. We utilised a longitudinal study of corn farmers and non-farming controls in Iowa to examine the impact of exposure to atrazine and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) on markers of oxidative stress. These pesticides are associated with oxidative stress in vivo, as well as cancer, and are among the most widely used herbicides in the United States. </P><P><B>Methods</B></P><P>The study included 225 urine samples collected through the growing season (pre-planting, planting, growing season, harvest, and off-season) of 10 controls who did not apply pesticides occupationally and 30 farmers who did; all were non-smoking men ages 40 to 60 years. Atrazine mercapturate (an atrazine metabolite), 2,4-D, and oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde [MDA], 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine [8-OHdG], and 8-isoprostaglandin-F2α [8-isoPGF]) were measured in urine samples.

To maximize such efficiency, it should be integrated and managed in proper size and that way, we would be able to reinforce its competency. In addition, the marrow of the enhanced competency is applying creativity and convergence and various public institutions are recently working on it to fortify their competency. However, Korean government`s policy is more focusing on privatization than nationalization and the government has established Port Authority (PA). The function of PA aims to fostering autonomy of management, autonomy, entrepreneurship, professionalism, small government policy, cost-effectiveness, and overall efficiency Numerous harbors around the world have been enlarged and globalized. Naturally, many opinions on PA have been growing and they are mainly about integration of PA once again. In addition, many ideas are now focusing on how to integrate and what procedures will be applied. In details, there are some perspectives whether the integration is surely appropriate, urgent, beneficial, and inevitable especially since competition of harbors in the North-East region has been fierce and there will be more harbors in the near future and the business model of the region is mainly based on direct lines for large vessels. Moreover, the nations in the region are fostering logistics hub ports Due to FTA, countries in North-East region are changing their industrial locations in order to deal with non-tariff barriers. Consequently, there have been changes on logistics networks and it requires PA focusing on building sustainable capability for efficient management. Integration of PA features a great chance of expanding its markets internationally This paper is based on AHP approach to identify priority on merging PAs. The factors of evaluation are: economic feasibility, efficiency consistency, stability, and competency Outcome of the analysis shows competency is the crucial factor. Also, when it comes to proposal for PA integration, merging turns out to be the best solution and maintaining the current structure comes in second. In order to utilize PA, it requires distinctiveness of environment of harbors and shipping companies, unique system, enhanced international competency, and efficiency and suitability of management. First of all, Global Terminal Operator (GTO) pursues dualization of scale and diversification of business. Second, logistics market has been integrating in a great size so it requires PA to achieve the optimal solution: pushing through economy of scale and scope at the same time. Third, PA needs to set an evaluation standard on harbors based on long-term perspective, objectivity, validity, and fairness. To utilize PA, cooperation between foreign harbors is crucial and strategic partnership, fortifying its capability and complementary collaboration are required because PA features environmental and regional distinctiveness. Thus, enhancing its international capability via global cooperation and integration is required."
modified one-element method for exact dynamic responses of a beam by using the frequency domain spectral element method,2016,"['Spectral element method', 'One-element method', 'Two-element method', 'Modified one-element method', 'Dynamic response']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>In the spectral element method (SEM), there are two ways to deal with external loads applied to a structure member. One way is to represent the structure member as a single finite element subjected to effective nodal forces and moments at two end-nodes of the finite element, which is called the “one-element method” (OEM). The other way is to represent the structure member as two finite elements, with consideration of the external loads as nodal forces and moments applied at the joint node (i.e., the excitation point), which is called the “two-element method” (TEM). The OEM does not require the assembly of finite elements, but in general provides poor dynamic responses. On the other hand, the TEM requires the assembly of finite elements, but always provides exact dynamic responses. Based on this intrinsic exactness of the TEM, a new SEM-based solution technique called the “modified one-element method” (MOEM) is proposed. The MOEM is developed by analytically transforming the SEM-based two-element model into the form of the SEM-based one-element model and it can provide exact dynamic responses without the assembly of finite elements.

This article deeply examines Paul’s pedagogy and Spirituality in education assuming Paul as an educator. In order to understand the characteristics of Paul as an educator, first of all, it is necessary to take a look Paul’s educational background. Education that Paul received before and after his Damascus experience helped him to become a good educator in the Gentile world. Next topic that is going to be introduced is Paul’s pedagogy according to four elements: the meaning of ‘teaching’, the goal of education, pedagogical language, attitude as an educator.  Paul must have inherited and set his meaning of ‘teaching’ from the Old Testament and the Jewish tradition about education which emphasize that educators are the ones who do the work of God who is the educator of the Bible. Paul’s educational goal is “to announce Christ’s cross” and human personality transformation through their relation with Christ. The realization of the human vocation, that is Imago Dei, can be achieved by one’s effort to live in conformity to the Cross. Educational language that Paul used in his letters are divided into three levels: rhetoric-persuading dimension(exhortation and admonition), pastoral-functional dimension(paternity and maternity), testimony and transformation dimension(imitation).  On the basis of these three dimensions, by reviewing Pauline letters, examination of Paul’s attitude(style) as an educator within his communities follows. Paul exhorts them by God’s mercy, takes care of believers within communities as father and mother and becomes a model to imitate. Thus, reflection of several key elements of spirituality in education for modern educators in this age takes place in the end.  In sum, an educator is ‘a leading learner’ and educational goal has to be human personality transformation following that of Christ. As a commissioner of God, an educator must teach and create good space for learning. Educator must use persuading pedagogy in which logos, pathos and ethos are integrated. Through education, an educator must weave networks of relations between Christ, that is, the subject of teaching and learner and educator."

The immunosensor was constructed by modifying gold electrode with electrochemical reduction of graphene oxide-carboxyl multi-walled carbon nanotube composites (ERGO–CMWCNTs) and electrodeposition of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for effective immobilization of primary antibody (Ab1). Ferroferric oxide–manganese dioxide–reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites (Fe3O4@MnO2–rGO) were designed as labels for signal amplification. On one hand, the excellent electroconductivity and outstanding electron transfer capability of ERGO–CMWCNTs/AuNPs improved the sensitivity of the immunosensor. On the other hand, introduction of rGO could not only increase the specific surface area for immobilization of secondary antibody (Ab2) but also build a synergetic effect to reinforce the electrocatalytic properties of catalysts. Fe3O4@MnO2–rGO nanocomposites were characterized by scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Using AFP as a model analyte, the proposed sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor exhibited a wide linear range of 0.01–50 ng · mL-1 with a low detection limit of 5.8 pg · mL-1. Moreover, the Fe3O4@MnO2–rGO-based peroxidase mimetic system displayed an excellent analytical performance with low cost, satisfactory reproducibility and high selectivity, which could be further extended for detecting other disease-related biomarkers."

Schaeffler attempts to interpret critically the achievements of Bloch’s subversive hermeneutics and to explore the possibility of laying the catholic theology of hope. Schaeffler points out Bloch’s ‘edit-historical Bible understanding,’ in which priests have faked Israelites religious traditions, as a problem. Instead, he suggests ‘religions-historical Bible understanding’ as an alternative, which emphasizes dialectical mediation of ‘promise’ and ‘accomplishments.’ Schaeffler also criticizes Bloch’s theory of extreme dichotomy as it exaggerates the extent to which ‘this world’ and the ‘coming world’ are in a conflict. He suggests dialectical identity of the two worlds as an ideal destination of Christian theology of hope. To that end, Schaeffler presents the difference between the Israelites’ religious point of view and that of the Persians. Bloch’s dualistic, atheistic Bible interpretation, according to Schaeffler’s argumentation, is not a result of manipulation by the priest, but of Bloch’s misunderstanding of religious-historical developmental processes from dualism to monotheism.  Through his criticism against Bloch, Schaeffler will re-transform the principle of Biblical hermeneutics to traditional Christian principles. Schaeffler argues that Persian requisites rooted in Jewish traditions flowed in at the end of Babylonian captivity era. However, the bond between Israelites and Persians dates back to the era of Abraham. Moreover, considering retroactively to the era of slavery in Egypt or the process of contacts before the Babylonian exile era, it is not sufficient for Schaeffler to unilaterally paralyze Bloch’s biblical interpretation. The dialectical thoughts of Kant, Bloch, and Schaeffler, which are the typical types of postulate think-method, aim to get rid of logical contradiction through inevitably asked apologetics and to find the condition in which such resolution may be possible. From this notion, we can realize that it is our important task to check the similarities and differences between Bloch’s philosophy of hope and Schaeffler’s Catholic theology of hope. While Bloch tries to interpret the Bible from an atheistic, Persian dualistic perspective, hereby establishing his philosophy of hope, Schaeffler attempts to re-formate it into theistic, monotheistic theology of hope."

In the process of teaching this to and transforming the people, it became the central principle of ancient Korea. The hwarang and kuksŏn, who modeled themselves on this guiding ideology, were the leading forces of Silla and the key figures in the unification of the three kingdoms of Silla, Kokuryŏ, and Paekche. During the later years of Silla, however, they underwent some changes. In Koryŏ, there were efforts to revitalize sŏnp’ung; however, only the recreational aspects were emphasized.

Since the mid-1990s as Hallyu such as Korean drama and K-pop started to garner popularity, Korean pop culture has been receiving international attention. There has been a renewed interest in Korean enjoyment, talent, and style, as well as in traditional culture of Korea.  P’ungnyudo, mentioned early on by Ch’oe Ch’iwŏn in Nallangbisŏ, grounded itself on traditional culture at the same time it was open and accepting towards foreign culture.

Cotinine-verified smoker was classified as urinary cotinine level above 50 ng/mL.?Results: The prevalence of self-reported smoking was 38.1% in men and 2.6% in women and that of cotinine-verified smoking was 36.7% in men and 4.0% in women. The overall prevalence of MetS was 15.5% and 3.6% in men and women. The prevalence of MetS in self-reported smoker group was higher than self-reported non/exsmoker group (18.4% vs 8.1%) and that of MetS in cotinine-verified smoker group was higher than cotinine-verified nonsmoker group (18.1% vs 8.2%). Multivariate logistic regression model adjusted for age, sex, BMI, alcohol drinking, exercise, total cholesterol, BUN, creatinine, uric acid, hs-CRP except for MetS components showed that self-reported current smoking significantly increased the odds ratio (OR) for MetS compared with nonsmoking (OR[95% CI], 1.41[1.32, 1.50]). Cotinine-verified smoking and log-transformed urinary cotinine level were associated with MetS, respectively (1.33[1.27, 1.41] and 1.05[1.01, 1.09]). The results for the components of MetS revealed that cotinine-verified smoking was positively associated with TG (＞150 mg/dL), HDL-cholesterol (＜40 mg/dL for men, 50 mg/dL for women) and glucose (＞100 mg/dL), but negatively associated with BP (＜130/85 mmHg). However, in the multivariate regression models including the components of MetS, both self-reported current smoking and cotinine-verified smoking did not significantly associated with MetS.?Conclusions: This large cohort study shows that the degree of agreement between self-reported and cotinine verified smoking status in women is relatively lower than in men. Although urinary cotinine is associated with MetS in both men and women, urinary cotinine could be a conditional factor interacting with traditional MetS components."

Recently, much effort has been directed to the development of stimuli-sensitive liposomes that are able to respond to certain internal or external stimuli, such as, pH, electricity, temperature, magnet, or light. Among them, to obtain liposomes which release the contents in response to ambient temperature, liposomes have been modified with chemically synthetic polymers having various lower critical solution temperatures (LCST). In this study, instead of chemically synthetic polymers, a biologically produced elastin-like polypeptide (ELP), which was composed of oligomeric repeats of the pentapeptide sequence (Val-Pro-Gly-Val-Gly), was used for endowing the liposome with thermo-sensitivity. A model drug was encapsulated in the ELP-conjugated liposomes and the release behavior of the drug caused by the liposome disruption due to the aggregation of ELPs was investigated. In addition, conjugation of ELP to liposome was identified with Fourier Transformed Infrared (FT-IR) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analyses."

By 2018, the Republic of Korea will become the 6th country to have hosted all of them following France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Russia. Korea also hosted two Universiades, three Asian Games, a World Rowing Championship, CSIM World Games and plans to host more international events. In addition, the country’s top athletes have participated in all scales of mega sporting events and have produced great results. For example, Korea’s national team placed 5th in the medals stand at the 2012 London Summer Olympics. This significant achievement has transformed South Korea into a sporting powerhouse. There are numerous key factors behind South Korea’s emergence as a sporting powerhouse: efficient investment in sport science, continuous effort of hosting sporting events, striving to discover promising young athletes and training them efficiently by collaborating science and sports. Experts in diverse fields (scientists, analysts, psychologists, physiologists, coaches, dietitians, etc) of sport meticulously studied the optimal conditions needed for athletes to enhance performance and achieve the best possible results in competitions. The development and expansion of sport science studies, technology and equipment laid the foundation for the athletes needs and provided optimal conditions for athletes to train which ultimately led them to be successful and win medals. Knowledge management is imperative in building on these successes, findings and experiences. The fundamental role of knowledge management and its importance for competitive advantage are clear. Knowledge itself has become both a strategic property and a major source of competitiveness. Therefore, there needs to be a game plan for gathering needs assessment to develop knowledge management solely dedicated to sports science as well as a database to collect the vast wealth of experience gained from hosting games. The collected data or knowledge will be analyzed and interpreted to find appropriate motivations and solutions to further maximize factors necessary for South Korea to maintain its standing as a sporting powerhouse. Establishing a model or system of knowledge management can innovate, benefit, and further exploit the success of South Korea’s sporting landscape."

It is necessary because the Christian universities should find a way to cope with the university restructuring strongly driven by the government and strengthen educational competitiveness. The evangelical personality education can realize a distinctive and excellent Christian education, which should foster the spirituality incarnating the kingdom of God. The incarnational spirituality education aims at a holistic, integrated education, not restricted to a cognitive learning, but leading to a comprehensive learning - knowing, sharing, and practicing the values of the Gospel while cultivating religious personality and moral character. Nurturing the spirituality purposes to establish a right relationship with God to develop self-esteem, community values, and responsibility for neighbor, society, nature, and the world. It is the incarnational spirituality education to infiltrate the values of the Gospel such as truth, love, and service into the whole personality. It will transform the whole person to forge links with neighbor, local community, and glocal society and help to realize on earth the core value of the kingdom of God, that is, shalom encompassing justice, peace, and love. The incarnational spirituality education can be argued on the theological bases supported by H. Richard Niebuhr’s model of the Gospel transforming culture, Johannes F. Hoekendijk’s idea of missio dei, Theo Sundermeier’s missiological concept of Konvivenz, Thomas H. Groome’s educational theory of conation, and William A. Linton’s ideal of the Christian university. This paper suggests how to practice the incarnational spirituality education, presenting cases and examples of the Christian universities in Korea. The incarnational spirituality education should include first, culture-transforming education correlating faith with learning; secondly, holistic, practical education enabling the whole personality to know, share, practice the values of the Gospel; thirdly, communal and glocal education transcending the self to participate in community and facilitate the realization of shalom in the glocal society; finally but not least, mutual relational education between professors and students through personal meeting and communal life sharing. The success of the alternative evangelical education will rely on the best use of curricular courses, extra-curricular activities, and efficient educational systems that the Christian university will make."

Overall the study concluded that women's leadership tends to be more democratic and more transformational than that of men. Inclusion of female in the leadership and decision-making process results in successful and effective performance in the management of various corporations and organizations.Then, the study had suggested six points to enhance the gender inclusive leadership; first, searching for potential women leaders among women pastors; second, allowing women leader to empower themselves and increasetheir leadership competence; third, overcoming female stereotype such as self-pity, low- self esteem, and passivity; fourth, developing role-model of women in leadership so that such stories can concretize and inspire other women; fifth, finding a way to solve reentry problems for the married women pastors, and finally, cooperating from male leaders in the churches."

Christian churches have also underlined the importance of material blessings from God, and sought to become megachurches. It is extremely difficult for anyone to avoid the influence of this significantly corrupt structure and the consequences of its existence in both Korean society and the church. The need for critical pedagogy for Christian adults has become urgent, as it is now imperative individuals become aware of the aforementioned crisis. Christian adults must be educated on how to interpret and analyze the crisis, participate in various critical discourse about the crisis, and help transform society. The purpose of this study is to explore the important tasks of the critical adult learning, by studying Jesus’ parables which are ideal models of critical pedagogy for Christian adults. I will study critical theories of adult learning, with a particular focus on theories influenced by Paulo Freire and Jürgen Habermas, to better understand the critical theory of Christian adult learning. Also, I will investigate the literary criticism of John Dominic Crossan and Bernard B. Scott, and the social-scientific criticism of William Herzog to better study Jesus’ parables.   This study points out five characteristics of Jesus’ teaching that used parables. First, Jesus helped adults have opportunities for self-reflection through self-confrontation. Second, Jesus challenged conventional beliefs and systems, and encouraged adults to develop post-conventional thinking and faith. Third, Jesus encouraged people to critically analyze personal problems in their social contexts. Fourth, Jesus awakened people's numbness of other's suffering, and empowered them to foster compassion and empathetic solidarity. Finally, Jesus showed the vision of the Kingdom of God and urged people to participate in transformative activities. Based on important insights from Jesus’ educational methods shown in the parables, I suggest three tasks of critical learning for Christian adults. First, the church needs to make an effort to form learning communities for public faith. Second, Christian adults need to participate in project groups in order to find and clarify social issues for critical reflection and public discourse. Third, Christian education should empower adults to foster empathetic solidarity and practice social diakonia."

His minimalist, drybrush style, featuring angular rocks and sparsely foliaged trees, is iconic in the history of Chinese painting, which impacted later painters. Ni established a composition of tall trees, rocks, and an empty pavilion by the shore, set against an expansive, level-distance vista, a composition that is closely related to his psychological selfhood during the turbulent years of the late Yuan period characteristic of peasant revolts and dynastic change. He painted virtually the same compositions throughout his entire life and saw them as symbolic of himself and his world. The dramatic change in his life from a wealthy landowner to a lone wanderer living in a houseboat played a central role in making him a noble recluse expressing his self in paintings. Ni Zan became something of a legend in later times embodying the essence of literati painting. Ni’s “empty pavilion” imagery became the enduring model for later painters who found in his simplicity of style and independence of spirit a source of inspiration. He was not one of the “Four Great Masters” until the late Ming period when eminent cultural luminaries such as Dong Qichang (1555-1636) attempted to replace Zhao Mengfu (1254-1322) with him. Late Ming literati made concerted efforts to establish Ni Zan as a cultural hero representing the ideals of elegance, loftiness, and detachment. Popular imagination further helped the veneration of Ni Zan as a noble recluse. Popular stories about Ni such as his obsession with cleanliness gained wide currency and came to be frequently retold in the late Ming and Qing periods. Recent studies, however, have offered different accounts of Ni Zan, the most politically disengaged and eccentric of late Yuan painters. He has been considered a lofty recluse in self-imposed isolation pursuing the aesthetics of remoteness, solitude, tranquility, and refinement in paintings. Ni Zan was, in fact, not detached from worldly concerns. He socialized actively with government officials and local magistrates and created poems and paintings for them. Ni was never isolated. Ni was under constant pressure to complete commissioned paintings. He was busy responding to clients’ and patrons’ requests. This image of Ni Zan is completely different from what we have of him. Recent revisionist readings of Ni’s character and relationship to the conditions of his age have offered an insight into the ways in which his reputed “pure loftiness” has been historically and culturally constructed. The invention of Ni Zan is inseparable from the long historical process in which our way of perceiving and interpreting the painter has been formulated. The contradictory accounts and competing interpretations of Ni Zan will lead us to look into how changes in interpretive practices, critical vocabularies, cultural demands, and the intervention of influential critics serve to create the image of the late Yuan painter as a cultural hero. Examination of each period’s changing perceptions of Ni will shed light on the ways in which the painter was transformed from an eccentric in early times into a noble recluse embodying a moral ideal in later periods."

The Training College developed into a veritable European centre for manual training. Its two directors Woldemar Gotze and Alwin Pabst, on the one hand, transferred Scandinavian, French and American ideas and practices to the German context. On the other hand, foreign experts referred to and visited the Training college in order to enhance reforms in their own countries. Despite his enthusiasm, Pabst was not able to transform the Training College into a model school and new education research centre. Finally it is shown how Pabst theoretically reflected on processes of cultural development and cultural transfers, largely following the historian Karl Lamprecht."
design and emulation of the agricultural vehicle shock system using matlab,2016,"['automotive shock absorber system', 'MATLAB', 'system transfer function', 'simulation.']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Automotive shock absorber system is mainly used to solve the impact of road surface roughness to the body, in order to improve the driving stability of the vehicle. The shock absorber system not only determines a vehicle ride comfort but also have a vital role to the handling safety of the vehicle. With the continuous improvement of comfort and quality requirements, the performance of the shock absorber system has become one of the important indicators to measure the quality and grade of the vehicle. To analyse the process of shock impact, time domain of automotive shock absorber system was simulated using MATLAB. The automotive shock absorber system can be regarded as a low pass filter since the function of the damping system is to reduce the fluctuation caused by the uneven road surface. The shock absorber system can be modeled by two order linear constant coefficient differential equation, and transform it into system transfer function. The two parameters of undamped natural frequency and damping ratio affect the vehicle shock characteristic. Using MATLAB software environment, the actual system can be simulated, and the simulation results were analyzed, processed which improved the efficiency of the problem solving."

This transformation of Hirohito, led by GHQ with US government`s delegation, was realized on visual dimension, too. Hirohito`s visual metamorphosis was epitomized in the `emperor`s new clothes`. The new image of the Showa emperor in suit with a felt hat replaced his old image as generalissimo, and heavily contributed to hiding his war responsibilities. The photograph of Hirohito and MacArthur, though a reminder of the pains of the war defeat and a symbol of emperor`s fall from grace, also launched the production and distribution of the images of the emperor clad in new clothes. In that photograph, the Showa emperor was no more a living god. He was a victim suffering from the defeat of war, and a partner of US power separated from the Japanese militarists. With the `Humanity Declaration` of Showa emperor, Ministry of the Imperial Household began to produce and distribute the photographs of the humanized emperor and imperial family. Those pictures presented Showa emperor not as a man of war, but as a model family man to the American public as well as to the Japanese people."

As with other Western countries, Netherland had to suffer severe economic transformation and welfare crisis. In order to face and overcome institutional crisis, major social actors and interest groups had to transform themselves by introducing major labor market and institutional reform reforms. Netherland were able to achieve relatively successful changes by shifting their traditional corporatism into a more adaptative, pragmatic, and flexible way. This study named Dutch model of social coordination as adaptative corporatism and tried to explain about two decades of labor market reform processes beginning from the early party of 1980s. The so called ‘Job Revolution’ has been a massive social and economic exchanges among major social forces including political parties, employers, and labor unions. Those processes are distinguished by long sustained social compromises and consistent execution of institutional reforms. Those changes can be understood as adaptative coordinations based on strong social trust among major interest groups and complex economic exchanges. Dutch social actors were able to carry out their reform by inclusive as well as flexible social compromises integrating diverse social interests."

Since social media appeared, it has started to take a role as a media platform where multimedia contents are developed and consumed by moving beyond a tool for sharing simple text and profiles. In this situation, this study takes notice of a functional transformation of social media and proposes a theoretical model for inducing more participation from users and an increase of whole welfare of users. Establishing the model, we consider uses and gratifications theory, two-sided market and gamification to explore requirements of a media platform for active users and interpret structure of social media as a two-sided market and reveal effects of gamification that gratifies desires of users.By verifying the model, we intend to prove the influence of game mechanisms to gratifying motives of users and the improvement of whole welfare. Randomly extracted 646 posts from Instagram and accumulated data from those are obtained. The more hashtags are tagged in a certain post, the more increased utilities of producers and audiences in social media. Moreover, a growth of producers’ utilities causes an increase of new followers of the post’s producer and a growth of audiences’ utilities causes an increase of new posts of the post’s producer."

The children curriculum in the PCK started newly by the name of the God’s people, light of the world(GPL) on the 2013. GPL curriculum emphasizes Holy Spirit by the critical reflection to the 3rd curriculum of the PCK.  This article analyzes all the texts from 1st texts to 5th texts, and suggests the alternative curriculum for the children education to Holy Spirit. For revision and alternation of the children education to Holy Spirit, this article says the foundational theory of the Holy Spirit based on the evangelical theologian theories. Foundational theories are the identity of the Holy Spirit, the understanding of Holy Spirit related to the Word of God, the understanding of Holy Spirit related to the church, the understanding of Holy Spirit related to the world.  This article suggests a reconceptualization with the understanding to Holy Spirit in the play group of perichoresis as a being mode of the triune God. Holy Spirit is Spirit of play. The goal of Holy Spirit’s play has a meaning in its own itself instead of the results of the play. Holy Spirit’s history as play has a meaning in process rather than the end of history as product. Holy Spirit’s play is not a transfer model as concentrating on concepts moving from the teacher to the student but a transformative model inviting the children to make the journey of discovery for their personal theological meaning.  The content of Holy Spirit’s play emphasizes the wondering method as conceptual play on the Word of God. Wondering opens the creative process and draws both the lesson and the child’s life experience into the personal creation of meaning. Wondering on the Word of God is to playing with the parables such an unusual experience for children. In parables there is not single answer but many right answers.  Holy Spirit related to the church in children education stimulates to play the children in the faith community with circle forms. Circles as church of children’s faith community are a fundamental shape in the world and in our imagination. And circles articulate the sky as a bowl turned over above us. Circle never end when one travels around their circumference. Circles give an equal opportunities to the teacher and the learners to participate in worship, lesson, and many kinds of activities.  Holy Spirit related to the world of children emphasizes the character education by activities and participates in project method. By the project character education, children could have opportunities of a formation of characters for their social life in home and school by themselves. By the expressive art, children express their feeling and thought to the faith through Holy Spirit. And the curriculum of children in PCK needs to including children who suffer, anxiety, and even death from living in communities plagued by violence."

It is very remarkable that this phenomenon, which can not be found in analogy to the texts of zainichi, appeared in the popular culture area because it is 'similar' to the consumption of Japanese society in the following years.“GO” and “blood and bones” are common ties in the modern Japanese culture is a ‘conservative father’ almost hidden trace. Both of these works have a structure in which the main character, “Father's Story,” looks at the direction of the “story of his children”, which is a typical story in traditional zainichi literature. It is true that there is enough room to see. However, if you look closely, you can see that both films form an image in the form of strengthening the father's physicality in the film' reproduction 'process. “GO” emphasizes the father's “physicality” in order to let the son choose a life that is faithful to the “everyday sense” rather than the “body” and “idea” rather than the “theory”, and “blood and bones” And the father of ‘transcendental human image’ that excludes the property of ‘father’ is created through strengthening. This can be attributed to the strategy that was intended to simplify the complex narrative structure of the original work in the process of reproducing the popular culture. Despite this transformation, both works faithfully convey the theme of the original work, It succeeds in bringing out.On the other hand, if consumption in Japan of zainichi text since the 2000s is based on a conservative patriarchal image that has been largely ignored in contemporary Japanese culture, Japanese society has newly established a gender role model for men and women after the bubble economy collapse in the 1990s It is also possible that the company is consuming 'Father's Award' in Japan. If the desire of Japanese society to summon a traditional men's prize was expressed by the consumption of the zainichi text and it succeeded in the success of these two works, these examples will be used to expand the overall culture of zainichi, It is necessary to set a more stable future."

The framework of research analysis followed the analysis model of “Intertextual Politics” proposed by the modified theory of Fairclough Norman(CDA), and this study was carried out according to proposed text description, text deconstruction, text practice and discourse control. The result shows that governmental coping methods with disaster were all used as a political instrument. It also demonstrates that, even after critical explanation and discourse prediction based on the news photographs, the government exerts with control through another intervention. In sum, the fundamental problems of disaster coping still remain unsolved. The reason why disastrous incidents transform into political issues consists in the protection of privileged class. Also, the reason why discourse control is enhanced again is explained by defensive political situations."

This study attempted to fill the gap in the literature by treating the franchisee dissatisfaction as a mediator in the relationship between these constructs, identify how franchisor’s leadership and franchisee’s marketing efforts have effects on franchisee dissatisfaction, in turn, reduce switching intentions, and provide the managerial implications for building a long-term relationship to achieve mutual goals between franchisors and franchisees Research design, data, and methodology – In order to test the hypotheses, the data were collected from franchisees in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province. The franchisee owners were informed about the purpose of this study by the trained interviewers. The respondents received a letter introducing the purpose of this study and another letter that the owners wrote to encourage their active participation. Among the 300 questionnaires distributed, 260 (86.7%) questionnaires were returned. Of those collected questionnaires, 6 uncompleted responses were excluded, and 254 questionnaires with an effective response rate of 84.7% were coded and analyzed using frequency, confirmatory factor analysis, and correlations analysis, and structural equation modeling with SPSS 21.0 and SmartPLS 3.0.Results – The findings of the study are as follows. First, franchisor leadership had a negative effect on franchisee dissatisfaction, but franchisee marketing efforts did not have a significant effect on franchisee dissatisfaction. Second, franchisee dissatisfaction had a positive effect on switching intentions. Third, franchisor leadership had a negative effect on switching intentions, but franchisee marketing efforts did not have a significant effect on switching intentions. Conclusions – This study researched the franchisor’s leadership as a single factor of transformational leadership. Thus, it may have limits in measuring leadership. Future studies shall include emotional, loyal, and transactional leadership. In addition, the future studies shall also research the effect of franchisor’s leadership and franchisees’ marketing efforts on dissatisfaction and switching intentions. For example, the franchisor’s relationship-oriented efforts can be a crucial parameter that reduces dissatisfaction and switching intentions."

Thus it is difficult to see competition and cooperation as independent but interacting concept of a relationship. The business strategy called co-opetition(hereafter coopetition) means that a firm cooperates with rivals, while at the same time it competes with these partners. The main reasons that are mentioned as a motivation for co-opetition are “shrinking product life cycles, need for heavy investments in research and development, convergence of multiple technologies, and importance of technological standards” (Gnyawali & Park, 2011 p. 650). According to previous studies, the most common motives for firms to engage in coopetition are to develop new markets, to enforce competitive advantages or industry standards, to share the costs of research and development, and to improve the profit of firms in participating the relationship.Since the entertainment industries are the result of the union of several sectors (ranging from music, movie, drama, ICT, to publishing and broadcasting), they naturally involve many participants in value chains which were once independent. Not only the entertainment industries are typically dominated by uncertainty, but also the traditional media and entertainment value chain has been transformed dramatically. These are exactly the same issues that the entertainment and media industries face. Generally, it is known that coopetition emerges from the increasing uncertainty and interdependence between firms in complex industries. Nevertheless, coopetition between firms of entertainment industry has been discussed rarely in academic sectors. Therefore, this study looks into existing research and findings on coopetition strategy, which could be of use for the entertainment and media industries through a case study of SM Entertainment.This study observed four different motives of coopetition in the entertainment industry based on the case study of SM. First, it was found that SM uses a coopetition strategy to supplement any lacking experience and to minimize the risks of failure in developing the foreign markets. Coopetition strategy was a powerful means of developing new market opportunities and complementing the lack of experience in foreign markets. Second, SM promotes coopetition with competitors to maximize the efficiency of resource use in their development of differentiated contents. Thus, cooperation with competitors was able to offer the advantage of a combination of the need to develop new contents as a result of competition while accessing new resources as a consequence of cooperation. Third, SM expands their business to various areas to maximally utilize their contents and upon this, they promote cooperation with even potential competitors in various areas to diversify their profitability. Fourth, SM cooperates with competitors as a strategy to secure and supplement their existing contents to strengthen and expand their dominance in existing markets. This study presents implications that such cooperation between competitors in various areas in the entertainment business ultimately greatly contributes to value creating and to expanding the domestic entertainment industry. These implications mean that the coopetition strategy is able to apply this model to the business and management practice of entertainment industry."

Especially, this model is based on a premise that the relationship between role stress and organizational commitment is moderated by leadership type. Hence this research tried to classify the type of leadership into two categories(trasactional leadership and transformational leadership).  Results showed as follows: first, role conflict negatively affected on the affirmative commitment, whereas Role ambiguity positively affected on the affirmative commitment.  Secondly, the moderating effects of leadership were different in follower’s situation. To put it concretely, in a role conflict situation, the transactional leadership was to further aggravate both affective commitment and normative commitment than transformational leadership. On the other hands, transactional leadership was more efficient when the followers are suffering in role ambiguity.   Based on the presented results, there is no single way of leading to enhance organizational effectiveness. Namely, every leadership style should be based on certain situation where their subordinates are.  Because modern society has been changed to NPS, police officer cannot help going through role stress. Therefore we should design to manage role stress of police officer for not only organizational effectiveness but also the safety of the people.  The researchers tried to suggest public administrative and public policy implication in the aspects of national development as well as the satisfaction of individual police officers.

They employed ""Gasa,"" one of representative styles of popular literature in Joseon, and spread the true self search training method among the public.  Living in almost the same times as him, Zen Master Hakmyeong presented the theories and practices to change the reality and society.  The vogue initiated by Zen Masters Gyeongheo and Hakmyeong was spread to Zen Masters Yongseong, Mangong, and Hanam and developed into social transformation and practice movements based on true self search through Zen meditation study such as the oneness movement of Zen and agriculture, independence movement, and translation project of Buddhist scriptures into Korean. The Gasa style was also used actively in those movements.  The true self search and social change movements during the times evolved into the movements of people rather than those of intellectuals and Buddhist leaders through the active utilization of Gasa style, thus holding huge significance. Moving those movements forward, they earned an insight into what kind of efforts the Buddhist community should make during the confusing transition period between the end of 19th century and the beginning of 20th century and translated their insights into popular movements through the awakening of people as well as leaders.

uav-based multiple source localization and contour mapping of radiation fields,2016,"['UAV', 'Source localization', 'Radiation mapping', 'Topographic map']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>This paper proposes an efficient approach to the multiple source localization and contour mapping problem of radiation fields using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). A typical radiation field originating from a single hotspot can be generated by three spatial distributions of sources; scattered, clustered and biased. Of these, the clustered sources are relatively easy to localize, because the sources are located in a close proximity to the center of distribution. In other cases, it is not very straightforward, because, when multiple radiating sources generate a hotspot in a cumulative manner, sources do not coincide with the hotspot position. Regardless of our knowledge about the hotspot position, we attempt to solve the multiple radiation localization problem in two steps: the Region Of Interest (ROI) selection and the source localization. Existing algorithms eventually explore whole area, causing the problem of excessive use of UAV resources. We therefore propose a framework to reduce ROI in a radiation field that not only optimizes the resources but also increases the localization accuracy. For the source localization process, two different methods are employed interchangeably. Those methods are called the Hough Transform and the Variational Bayesian, adaptively selected with a switching technique and the overall performance is evaluated by balancing between the localization accuracy and the required exploration. In favor of the optimization, the prediction model defines the type of sources in a way that the adaptive switching methodology can converge to an optimal solution by selecting an appropriate method. Thus, the proposed framework enables the UAV to accurately localize the radiation sources in a fast manner.

주관적 계층의식과 지역 간 격차의 결정요인,2016,"['subjective class consciousness', 'ordered logit', 'factor decomposition']","본 연구에서는 주관적으로 조사된 계층의식 자료를 가지고 계층의식 결정요인에 대해 분석한다. ‘2015 사회조사(The 2015 Social Survey)’ 원시자료에는 각자가 생각하고 있는 계층을 상상, 상하, 중상, 중하, 하상, 하하 등 6개 중에서 하나를 선택하게 하고 있다. 이 계층의식을 종속변수, 사회경제적 변수를 독립변수로 하고 순서로짓(ordered logit) 모형을 사용하여 주관적 계층의식 결정함수를 추정하였다. 추정결과 학력과 소득수준이 높을수록 계층의식이 높아지는 것으로 나타났다. 그리고 다른 조건이 일정하다면 직업 중에서는 농어업에 종사하고, 도시보다는 농촌에 거주하는 사람의 계층의식이 보다 높은 것으로 나타났다.주관적 계층의식을 제일 낮은 단계(하하)부터 제일 높은 단계(상상)까지 1부터 6까지의 기수값으로 변환하여 도시와 농촌의 계층의식 정도를 6점 만점으로 계산하면 도시는 2.71, 농촌은 2.60으로 도시가 농촌보다 0.11 높다. 이것은 계층의식 결정함수의 추정결과와는 반대인데, 이런 현상이 발생한 이유는 계층의식 결정함수에서는 사회경제적 변수를 동시에 고려하였는데, 도시거주자가 농촌거주자보다 학력이나 소득이 높은데 기인하는 것이다. Oaxaca요인분해법을 이용하여 계층의식 정도 격차의 요인분해를 하면 도시와 농촌 간 주관적 계층의식 격차의 대부분은 가구소득의 격차에 의한 것이고, 다음으로 교육수준의 격차에 의한 것이다.","This study analyzes the determinants of class consciousness by using the survey data based on subjective definition of class. ‘The 2015 Social Survey’ gives 6 choices of class (Upper High, Lower High, Upper Middle, LowerMiddle, Upper Low, Bottom Low). By using this class choices and the other socioeconomic variables, a subjective class consciousness function, based on the ordered logit model, is estimated. The results of estimation show thateducation level and income level have positive relationships with class consciousness. In addition, other things being equal, house ownership (compared with rental), married status (compared with unmarried, widowed,and divorced), agricultural and fishery sector (rather than the other sectors), and rural (rather than urban) residents showed higher class consciousness.If we transform the degree of subjective class consciousness into cardinal numbers from 1 (the lowest level) to 6 (the highest level), average score for the urban residents, 2.71 is greater than that of rural residents, 2.60. This isresult is not consistent with the previous estimation results of subjective class consciousness function, The inconsistency between two results comes from the differences in explanatory variables of subjective class consciousness function, Urban residents usually have higher values in socioeconomic variables such asincome and education levels than rural residents. Oaxaca factor decomposition shows that the differences in subjective class consciousness between urban and rural residents are mainly from household income differences and differences in education comes next."
research on the adipogenic differentiation of amscs and dfats in pigs,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Adipose tissue is the largest energy storage in the body, with the endocrine, paracrine and autocrine function, and they constitute a network regulatory signal, and participate in energy balance and metabolism regulation in adipose tissue. When adipose tissue is excessively accumulated or obesity, inflammatory signaling pathway is activated as the secretion increase of a variety of inflammatory cytokines, then, the body is under the state of chronic inflammation, causing insulin resistance and many metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, cancer and other chronic metabolic disease, and bringing a serious health crisis to humans. And, excessive fat deposition reduces the feed conversion rate, leading to the increase of livestock and poultry production cost and the reduction of meat food quality. Therefore, the regulation of adipogenic differentiation has become an important field in the study of human health and animal production. 1. The source of adipose tissue The formation of adipose tissue is due to the increase of adipose cell number caused by differentiation and the increase of adipose cell volume and adipose accumulation during development. This process is that adipose mescenchymal stem cells (AMSCs) are transformed to preadipocytes in adipogenic environment, and differentiation related specific transcription factors start to express and induce the specific expression of adipose cell genes and terminal differentiation, finally, mature adipose cells are formed after adipose accumulation. Recent studies have suggested that dedifferentiated fat cells (DFATs) may be an important source of adipose tissue. Mature adipose cells can be dedifferentiated to the sub cells (DFATs) with the dividing ability in vitro culture, and DFATs are pluripotent and can be redifferentiated to adipose cells or transdifferentiated to other cell types, such as cartilage cells, bone cells, muscle cells, etc. by induction. This suggests that DFATs are progenitor cells with the stem cell properties, showing the great potential in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Research on the mechanism of DFATs redifferentiation and transdifferentiation has an important significance for human health and animal production. 2. Regulation of adipocyte differentiation and transcription The adipocyte differentiation lies in the transcription level regulation, involving the cascade and cooperative effects of multiple transcription factors, among which, the core transcription factor is peroxisome proliferator activated receptors-γ (PPARγ), which specifically expresses in adipose tissue, combines the promoters of downstream genes promoter and induces their expression, such as lipoprotein lipase (LPL), insulin sensitive glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), fatty acid synthase (FAS), adipose-specific fatty acid binding protein-2 (AP2) and adiponectin, and promotes the differentiation and maturation of adipose cells. 3. Transcription regulation of PPARγ by Kruppel like factors Kruppel like factors (KLFs) are a class of transcription factors with zinc finger structure, which is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, cell differentiation and tumor formation in a variety of animal cell types. Since KLF15 is first proved to have the transcriptional regulation capability of adipose differentiation by Gray, et al. in 2002, other KLFs are also found to be involved in the adipose differentiation regulation. According to the recent studies of KLFs regulation of adipose differentiation, Christopher, et al. in 2009 summarized KLFs transcription regulation network in the PPARγ upstream. This network includes 8 types of KLFs, namely, KLF2-7, KLF11 and KLF15, among which, KLF2, KLF3 and KLF7 are involved in the negative regulation of adipose formation, while KLF4-6, KLF11 and KLF15 positively regulates adipose formation, and they express according to a certain time sequence during adipocyte differentiation. 4. Regulation of adipose differentiation by curcumin Curcumin is a kind of polyphenols extracted from Curcuma longa L.. Curcumin can reduce the mice obesity formation, directly interfere with the preadipocytes differentiation and decrease the adipocyte number and adipose accumulation. Moreover, curcumin plays a role in the early stage of adipocyte differentiation, and inhibit the mitotic proliferation process and the expression levels of PPARγ, C/EBPα, and certain downstream transcription factors. 5. Regulation of AMSCs and DFATs adipogenic differentiation in pigs It is generally believed that pigs are the most suitable animal models for the application of human clinical medicine. Also, pigs are the largest source of human meat food, and one of animals with the most fat content. Therefore, research on the regulation of porcine adipocyte differentiation has an important significance for the establishment of human disease model and the production of low fat and lean meat pigs. This report summarizes the expression patterns of different KLFs and the effect of curcumin on the KLFs and PPARγ expression during the adipogenic differentiation of porcine AMSCs and DFATs in recent years."

The Pearl Buck, the author of Good Earth, also praised Hangul as `Hangul has the most simple word structure in the world, but it can surprisingly express any sound by combine the consonants and vowels.` The excellence of Hangul is the excellence of philosophical structure embedded in the principles of inventing Hangul. In iconography system interpretation, Hangul is the character system made of trichotomy world view. Hangul, in its Hunminjeongeum Haerye Edition Introduction which explained the principles of invention, described as `Hangul is based on the three principles, heaven, earth and man. So the posterity cannot change in their discretion.`. Also, according to the Sejong chronicles, it is written as `the Korean alphabet was based on the classic letters, so it is not brand-new letter. The principles of pronunciation was newly invented, but the letters were emulated from the format of ancient classic letters`. Hangul made the 3 basic letters to consonant and vowel each, and expanded the characters by transforming these basic letters. The consonant was modeled from the shape of circle, triangle and rectangle. The vowel was modeled from dot, line and stroke. Like this, there was no object that Hangul could not express, by using 3 principles of consonants and vowels. Hangul also applies trichotomy philosophy by dividing the letter into initial, medial, and final consonant phoneme. This is the uniqueness that only Hangul possesses. Trichotomy can be seen to apply the notion of 3 principles (三才), heaven, earth and men. If scrutinizing its shape, it directly applies the placement and the direction of these 3 principles into the shape of the words. The initial phoneme is a consonant, so it becomes the leader to draw out the shape and direction. Then the medial is the vowel, which becomes the body for the center of the change. Then, the last one is the final phoneme, which works as a motive for the next word to come out. Like this, Hangul contains its basic 3 principles in every word. From this special phonemic structure, when conceiving the word, the brain acknowledges in spatial matter. The ways to read and write in Hangul is the natural measure to understand the basic principles of nature. Hangul is the only writing system made a philosophical concept.

This study analyzed the trend and progress of creating new governance structure of universities and reviewed the governance system and operational methods of professional and continuing education in Hong Kong. For this, through the process of conversion into complex system of higher education and lifelong learning, a marketing model that satisfies generalization of higher education creates profits by itself at the same time was applied to non-degree courses and other transformed continuing education courses. As a result, in the case of Hong Kong, considered only with the function and governance structure of universities, showed ecological context that enables very unique structural transformation; in this regard, higher education in Hong Kong has a so-called ‘two families under one roof’ system that includes: (1) the boundary of traditional university, (2) segregated degree-supplying structure for demands for elitist and universal higher education, (3) modularized ecosystem supplying non-degree programs that can be separated and combined, and (4) possibility of transferring higher levels through learning outcomes and degrees. This provides a few important implications in establishing higher level of lifelong learning system, in that they have developed higher educational system where various systems coexist, and degree programs and non-degree programs and academic degrees and professional certificates are converged and shared at the same time, beyond the system that focuses on 4-year university and degree system in South Korea. On the other hand, it is undeniable that the system has divided the ecosystem of higher education and lifelong learning into those with public fund and private costs."

Such a movement was also emerged in Colonial Korea. Minami Jiro(南次郞) appointed as the Governor General of Korea in Aug. 1936 felt keenly the necessity and roles of Economic General Staff. However, the outbreak and expansion of Sino-Japanese War in July 1937 substantially distorted and transformed the plan of Minami Jiro. While the Planning Department using the word ‘Planning’ for the first time was organized under Governor General of Korea in Nov. 1939, it couldn`t help acting merely as the subordinate office of the Planning Board in Japan because National Mobilization Law was enforced. After the liberation from Japan in Aug. 1945 and under the US military government, the American planning system was combined. Since then, it was generally agreed to establish a powerful government authority for planning economic affairs through the discussion on government organization and the Constitution of Korea. Accordingly, the Planning Agency was organized as the core institution for planned economy on the basis of the Korea Constitution and Government Organization Act in July 1948. The Planning Agency executed the intrinsic functions of Economic General Staff including extensive survey on economic affairs, auditing on budget plans and coordination of policies among government departments. In particular, Hyun-jun Jung(鄭顯準), the chief secretary who had the experience as the government officer in Manchukuo, played the important roles in selecting the manager-level officers and establishing the management plans in the Planning Agency. However, the Planning Agency was pushed away by Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Commerce and Industry insisting the free economy system without progressive support from the President Syngman Rhee(李承晩) in the rapidly changing political events in early 1949. Furthermore, the outbreak of Korean War in June 1950 stroke the fatal blow to the Planning Agency and planned economy. After all, the Economic General Staff in the First Republic of Korea couldn`t help being disappeared even without realization of original idea. However, the Economic Planning Board newly organized in July 1961 was the perfect model completing the Korean-style Economic General Staff. Including military-style order of rank, planning reminding the establishment of war strategy, goal orientation and rapidity like capturing advantageous position, unity emphasizing the omni-directional cooperation, mobilization of personal and material resources and professionalism of knowledge, all these intrinsic functions of Economic General Staff implemented in the Economic Planning Board became the critical elements realizing the distinguished growth of Korean economy since 1960s."

According to the comparative analysis of the level, it turned out that Japan obtained the highest level of privatization while South Korea ranked the lowest level. According to the research result of examination and certification ability of private institutions of our country, it turned out that our country is expected to have possibility of achieving higher level of privatization than that of the present. Moreover, according to the questionnaire survey conducted to the persons concerned regarding privatization direction, they gave positive response to all the indicated survey contents of privatization direction in terms of “delegation of certification services to private sectors (contracting-out)”, “transformation of EMC into private voluntary standard” and “changeover of conformity assessment agent”. However, from the view of acceptance and conflict model, it is estimated that starting from “delegation of certification services to private sectors (contracting-out)” seems to be the most advisable plan. Also, prior to privatization, it is required to improve relevant systems such as certification examiner system."

The specific results and conclusions are as follows. Firstly, Namgung teacher had realized two unique extracurricular such as enterprise sponsored caring program and learning clinic as a thematic model of ‘Harmony School Project’ by developing and evaluating extracurricular programs. Also, he had overcome the limit of existing ‘Hakbulism’ in Korean society through unfolding extracurricular activity, which is suitable for students of a small middle school in rural area. In the end, he harmonized improvement of school achievement and fostering of personality. The small size of school had become a generative power for holistic growth and development of a middle school students. Secondly, Namgung teacher had changed a ‘small’ middle school into a ‘good’ middle school by demolishing boundary between school and community. And then, he had built a school into a school as community. Also, he considered parents as not objects of enlightenment but partners of education for building a small and good school. The results of this paper will be useful for understanding on the inner transformation process and dynamics of a small size school."

This contradicts the existence of the steady state dune fields on the Earth. The recent studies have emphasized dune collisions as a key mechanism to the stability of dunefield. The roles of wind shadow aspect ratio, however, have yet to be fully explored. This research aims to investigate the potential roles of wind shadow aspect ratio in the dynamical behaviors of transverse dune field. The simplified model is established for this, based upon allometric properties of transverse dunes, wind speedup on the stoss slope and sand trapping efficiency. The derived governing equations can be transformed to the zoning criteria and vector field for dune evolution. The dynamics analysis indicates that wind shadow aspect ratios do not produce convergent areas on the behavior space; rather, they just act as one of the factors that affect the trajectories of dune evolution. Though the model cannot represent the stability of dune field, but seem to produce a reasonable exponent for dune spacing-height relations."

As the scope of the study, research questions were created to investigate potential factors of anger in which elementary school students typically experience negative sentiment through team game activities; 1) what does moderation mean toward anger sentiment in team games? 2) is it possible to maintain moderation from brain scientific perspective? 3) what is humanistic educational environment for maintaining moderation? As results, following were revealed; 1) moderation in anger sentiment is ‘mild’, and meaning of moderation point in team games requires understanding of the weak and self-control against the strong, 2) Aristoteles optimistically viewed the possibility of discovering and maintaining moderation from brain scientific point of view. In this regard, he suggested a reasonable ground that rationality can control and adjust irrationality, and concretely identified that emotion induction is generated through interactions between recognition and physiology as well as the fact that recognition and physiology pass through comprehensive process during emotion induction. 3) Thirdly, it is noticeable that ‘descriptive approach’ is recently preferred in moral education for personality training (education). Descriptive approach is popular in physical education in which the goal is to develop (moral) personality. For that reason, from the descriptive perspective, it is introduced as a model of instruction which includes responsibility to transform characters, unity, and team game to develop personality."
"research on market orientation, choices of patent strategies, and their output effect on alliance firms",2016,"['strategic alliance', 'market orientation', 'patent strategy', 'output effect']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The increasing competition in recent years made more and more firms regard strategic alliance as an important alternative and solution to respond to fierce competition. As a kind of system arrangement among firms, the concept of strategic alliance was first proposed by Hopland and Nigel in the early 1980s, who defined strategic alliance as the collaboration mode in which two or more firms, aiming at joint-owned both market and resources, formed the kind of cooperation to enhance advantages, share risk or cost, and also mutual flow of production factors via different kinds of contracts or agreement. However, even before this definition, many firms have already begun their alliance strategies practices. As a cooperative form, strategic alliance, no matter its specific types, becomes one key choice for firms to acquire, maintain and enhance their market shares and positions. Shrader (2001) found that collaboration to foreign firms become key methods for newly-founded firms and small firms to enter foreign markets, which can bring these firms with suitable knowledge and market information, making these firms expand even faster with lower costs and market risks. The enhancing pace of globalization and internationalization triggered firms’ attentions to external markets, Archibugi and Iammarino (2002) found that fierce changes in internal market forced firms to expand their market and product scopes, making more and more firms realize product and R&D internationalization by searching, choosing and collaborating with foreign firms. Dong and Glaister (2006) found Chinese firms cared more about market positions, international expansion and technology exchanges, while foreign firms tended to enter to Chinese market and learn how to operate in China via strategic alliances.Although, many scholars brought out managerial practices of firms’ strategic alliances, and had already formed theoretical foundations, researches related to market orientation, especially how alliance firms establish and realize their strategic goals and performance goals under market motivation is still lack of studies. In reality, the mechanism how firms’ alliance intention transformed into their strategic or performance goals is still in the black box. Taken alliance firms as research objectives, this paper tends to explore how firms constructed strategic alliance due to market-orientation realize their strategic or performance goals via choice of patent strategies. We introduced patent strategies to establish the matching model, to analyze how firms market orientation influence choices of patent strategies, and their mutual effects on firms innovative performance, in hope to provide to the future studies and managerial practice how firms can choose the reasonable and effective alliance partners according to their own strategic and performance goals. Based on differentiation of market access and market extension motivation, we pointed out that, in order to realize the transformation from alliance motivation to innovation performance, alliance firms had to choose and determine among a set of practical and operational plans. Patent strategies, as a kind of operational plan, were conducive to transformation from alliance motivation to innovation performance. With the framework of market motivation, patent strategy and firms innovative performance, we put forward the hypotheses on how market motivation affect firms’ choices of patent strategies, and also the joint effects of market motivation and patent strategies on firm innovative performance. We selected alliance firms in IT industry as samples, with data from Cooperative Agreements and Technology Indicators Database, USPTO and R&D Scoreboard released by Department for Business, Innovation & Skills of UK, we empirically tested effects of market motivation on choices of patent strategies, and also effects of market motivation and patent strategies on firms innovative performance. Results showed that: different market positions led to differentiated motivations and patent strategies in their strategic alliances, firms with relatively weak market positions tend to pursue strategic profile of patent defensive and leveraging strategies under market access motivation, while firms with strong positions would like to implement patent proprietary and leveraging strategies in market extension motivation. The implementation of patent defensive and leveraging strategies under market access motivation enhanced innovation efficiency of the firms with weak market positions. Since these firms focused more on market positions and opportunities, their market capitalization tended to improve, but the motivation and utilization of patent strategies had no effect on patent output. Similar to these firms, the ones with stronger market position were inclined to strengthen their market opportunities and improve their market capitalization. Results indicated that because of their stronger market positions, these firms showed lower awareness of innovation efficiency and their emphasis on patent output was not high either, which then led to the fact that both market extension motivation and patent strategies used had no effects on firms innovative performance measured by innovation efficiency or patent output."

Analyzing his literary theory chronologically, this paper were able to reveal that Song lian had falled into ancient prose of the Chin and Han dynasty for a long time. He have been symply summarized as a confucian literary man, but he could not extricate himself from ancient prose during youth and his manhood. It was only after that he met his teacher Huang jin 黃溍 and withdrew into the six confucian classics and began to have a view of literature based in confusian. But he still wasn’t able to rid himself of the temptation of ancient prose. At the age of fifty, assisting Zhu Yuanzhang 朱元璋 in founding Ming dynasty, he’s built up his own view of literature based in the Six Confucian Classics 六經, confucian scholars during the Song dynasty, ancient prose of the Tang and Song dynasty like as Hanyu 韓愈 and Ouyang Xiu 歐陽脩’s works. In short, undergoing a complete transformation individually and historically through a tumultuous period of the late Yuan and the early Ming, Song lian could establish his own view of literature based in confusian and present ideological coordinates and a new model of the Ming literature."
analyzing the cross cultural impact of the “world of barbie” on young indian girls in shaping their mindset to belong to a transnational imagined community,2016,"['global brands', 'memories', 'nostalgia', 'possession attachment', 'projected identity self identity', 'transnational imagined community']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper establishes the link between the “World of Barbie” and its influence in shaping the mindset of young, educated, urban Indian girls born post 1985 to belong to an albeit Transnational Imagined Community. Barbie, launched in India in 1985 by Mattel Toys India Ltd, quickly captured the mind, hearts and lives of young girls in the age 4-8years. Girls in the urban affluent Indian households became addicted to this “World of Barbie” and have enthusiastically imbibed the Barbie culture. Barbie, as Macdougall (2003) calls is a “Transnational Commodity”, has changed the way young Indian girls think of themselves belonging to a “Transnational Imagined Community”’ – be it the type of outfit they wear, how they converse with their peers, the way they define ‘glamour’ or ‘well-turned out’, or their aspired future state. The authors conducted a research amongst English speaking educated urban Indian affluent girls born between 1985 and 1998 who have internalized the “World of Barbie” which includes fashion accessories, bath sets, kitchen accessories etc. and enquired into how young girls think beyond their immediate environment , so as to delve deeper into the seminal work of Anderson(1983) on “Imagined Communities”. The present paper adopts the mix method research approach. Study 1 (Depth Interview) uses the deep understanding principle of case study research. Case study research is knowledge of “sense-making” processes created by individuals for a given stimuli (Woodside, 2010). Theory is built using case study research (CSR). “CSR method is an inquiry that focuses on describing, understanding, predicting, and/or controlling the individual” (Woodside (2010). Using CSR approach, Study 2 (focus group discussion) with Control group (girls not played with Barbie) and Research group (played with Barbie) was conducted. The authors used interpretive phenomenological analysis to infer the transcripts to understand the influence of “World of Barbie” on Transnational Imagined Community. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) explores in detail how participants are making sense of their personal and social world; the inferences were given conceptual code as following factors viz.,i) Past memories with Barbie, ii) Possession Attachment iii) Personal Internalization, iv) Behavioral Manifestation v) Global Imagined Community. The study 3 was fixed point (Likert type) survey analysis. The questionnaire consisted of 35 questions covering above mentioned factors. The final survey was conducted with sample size of N= 315. Structural equation modeling was used to derive the results. To conclude, ‘home country culture’ into which the respondent is born is seen to be malleable if internalization of certain alien culturalartifacts are positively imbibed into early childhood. The process of internalization of this new culture should be embedded in early childhood memories to bring about this cultural transformation in adulthood. This process of reculturation in the young urban Indian girls has been facilitated through the ‘World of Barbie’ helping their mindset to migrate into a distinctly different global culture as defined in the Transnational Imagined Community."

Generally, according to the previous studies, it is known that entrepreneurship positively affects economic growth and the reduction of unemployment rate through employment creation. The analysis of the impact of entrepreneurial activities on economic growth and job creation is mainly based on national comparative analysis. In this paper, however, the impact of start-up activities in the Busan metropolitan city on regional economic growth and employment improvement. In this study, the dummy variables were assigned to firms within three years, five years, and ten years after start-up according to the period since the start-up of the firm. .As a result of the empirical analysis, the value of dummy variable of the start - up firms was found to be significant in the analysis of the sales growth rate as the dependent variable according to the preceding study by Evans(1987). Therefore, it can be seen that the growth rate of the start - up company is higher than that of the other companies and it is positive for the regional economic growth. In addition, the coefficient of the dummy variable decreases from the enterprise analysis to the latter within three years, five years, and ten years after the start-up, and confirms that the coefficient of the firm's start-up years has a negative value. I could see more clearly.On the other hand, in the analysis of the effect of start-up firms on unemployment rate reduction, the growth rate of regular workers was higher than that of other firms. This suggests that it positively affects the reduction of the unemployment rate in the region. In addition, in the dynamic analysis using the Almon estimation formula and the Koyck model, the effect of log-transformed net start-up firms on the growth rate of new workers is very significant. As a result of the above model, It is reaffirmed that start-up activity has a positive effect on employment growth."

But at the same time Paris shows the historicization process to preserve and restore historic monuments of the past. Subsequently the ‘Vieux Paris’ considered negatively until the end of the 18th Century was rediscovered from an aesthetic point of view with the wave of romanticism in the early 19th century. This cultural trend was connected with the July monarchy""s policy in order to establish a new national identity. Louis-Philippe, the ‘Citizen-King’ and François Guizot, Minister of Interior wanted to make the July monarchy stand, in the name of ‘nation’, as synthetic successor of the past dynasty and the French Revolution. In this context, they started the policy of preservation and restoration of the historic monuments, models of common national memories. The practice of preservation and restoration led by Viollet-le-Duc was constantly advanced despite the political upheavals like the Revolution of 1848, Coup d""État of Louis Bonaparte and the establishment of the Second Empire. But it was forced to collide with various realistic and administrative problems, in particular with the Haussmann""s renovation of Paris under the Second Empire. After the inauguration of the Democratic government of the Third Republic, the practice of Viollet-le-Duc was clashed with new resistance. In criticizing the previous concepts and practices centered around the national model and the Middle Ages, the young historians and archeologists insisted the expansion of period from the Antiquity to the Modern Age and the inclusion of ruins about people""s everyday life. In this way, the policy of historic monuments changed from the establishment of the national model to the civil education of the History. This evolution of the 19th Century Paris gives two meanings. It shows, on one hand, the double relationship that the historicization against the modernization was in fact the product of the latter, and on the other, the transformation of the national identity around the policy of historic monuments."

This study sets out to explore some of the legal and institutional aspects of this Constitution-making process in order to grasp its distinctive features and implications. The legal framework of the Franquist regime consisted of 7 Fundamental Laws enacted subsequently from 1938 to 1967. This legal order was a reflection of the regime's authoritarian character such as the concentration of power in a personal figure, strong connection of the church and the state and the presence of a corporatist, non-democratic Parliament(Cortes). On November 22th 1975, Juan Carlos Ⅰ succeeded Franco's status as the Head of the State upon his death and appointed Adolfo Suárez as his president of the government on July 3rd 1976. Suárez submitted to the Parliament 「Law for Political Reform」as the 8th Fundamental Law which created a new Parliament comprised of a democratically elected Congress and a Senate whose maximum of 1/5 members could be appointed by the King. The Bill also provided the process of constitutional reform. The Parliament passed this law even though it meant precisely the self-destruction of its very own existence. A general election took place in June 15th 1977 and the new Parliament started to draft a new Constitution shortly afterward. A lengthy process took its course consisting of Congressional subcommittee(Ponencia), Congressional committee, Congressional plenary session, Senate committee, Senate plenary session, Joint committee and plenary session of both Houses. After the draft was approved by the Parliament, it was put to national referendum in which the Spanish people showed its approval. The new Constitution was finally promulgated by the King. The Spanish Constitution-making process involved both explicit process which took place in the Parliament and implicit constituent decisions made by the agreements of the government, the Parliament and the political parties which had a great influence on the outcome of the drafting process. The newly made Constitution expressed a profound transformation of the regime, but its generation was done while maintaining legal continuity. It also was a result of 'consenso' reached by the bargaining processes between diverse political parties over difficult issues such as the form of the state - monarchy or republic -, the relation of the church and the state and the autonomy of regions within the state. The drafting process provided the condition and environment for consensus-building, but the 'consenso' was by no means perfect as it can be seen in certain ambiguous and complex provisions of the Constitution. The problems which these ambiguities pose and the potential solutions for these problems still remain to be seen."
facility siting and plant layout optimization for chemical process safety,2016,"['Consequence Modeling', 'Optimization', 'Plant Layout', 'Facility Siting', 'Quantitative Risk Analysis (QRA)']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Designing the process layout in a chemical plant is a complex and multidisciplinary task requiring input from experts in fields such as chemical, civil, mechanical, and instrument engineering. Plant layout entails the allocation of a given number of facilities on a given piece of land. Determining the optimal distribution of facilities in a plant requires an optimization calculation, including a variety of distance constraints, one of which is related to process safety. A few approaches have been taken to transform consequence analysis, such as toxic gas dispersion and its mitigation as well as the risks of fire and explosions, into mathematical equations as constraints of an optimization problem.An optimization problem with constraints related to safety is not easy to solve given limitations such as nonlinearity, uncertainty, and ethical difficulties in converting human life to costs for calculation purposes. However, safety concerns have increased to the point that developing this type of approach is necessary. The objective of this study was to review the current methodologies for plant layout optimization and to resolve facility siting issues. Process safety concepts are considered with a view to identifying gaps and issues with current methods in order to develop better methodologies for designing safer layouts."

DTM(differential transformation method) was applied to vibration analysis of multi-cracked nonuniform nanobeam based on nonlocal elasticity theory and embedded in an elastic medium. The non-dimensional natural frequencies of this nanobeam were obtained for eoe, crack stiffness and elastic medium stiffness with various boundary conditions. The results obtained by this method was compared with previous works and showed the close agreement between two methods. The important conclusions obtained by this study are as follows : 1. As the length of nanobeam is shorter, the effect of scale coefficient is greater. 2. The locations of crack change non-dimensional natural frequency, In the case of fixed-fixed ends, the non-dimensional natural frequency is the biggest in the first crack location of 0.6L of nanobeam length, and the smallest in both ends. In the case of fixed-free ends, the closer the location of first crack go tho the free end, the bigger the non-dimensional natural frequency. 3. As the stiffness of crack is greater, the non-dimensional natural frequency is smaller, And the effect of crack stiffness is similar on both fixed-free ends and fixed-fixed ends. 4. The bigger the stiffness of elastic medium, the greater the non - dimensional natural frequency."
wide air-gap control for multi-module permanent magnet linear synchronous motors without magnetic levitation windings,2016,"['D-axis control', 'Independent vector control', 'MM-PMLSM', 'Position control', 'Wide air-gap control']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper proposes a wide air-gap control method for the multi-module permanent magnet linear synchronous motor (MM-PMLSM) based on independent vector control. In particular, the MM-PMLSM consists of symmetrical multi-module and multi-phase structures, which are basically three-phase configurations without a neutral point, unlike conventional three-phase machines. In addition, there are no additional magnetic levitation windings to control the normal force of the air-gap between each stator and mover. Hence, in this paper, a dq-axis current control applying a d-q transformation and an independent vector control are proposed for the air-gap control between the two symmetric stators and mover of the MM-PMLSM. The characteristics and control performance of the MM-PMLSM are analyzed under the concept of vector control. As a result, the proposed method is easily implemented without additional windings to control the air-gap and the mover position. The effectiveness of the proposed independent vector control algorithm is verified through experimental results."

In this study, I introduce various middle range theories that emphasize specific aspects of restructuring and test whether their predictions regarding the impact of restructuring on workers’ careers accurately account for observed patterns of occupational mobility. Based on estimation from the Survey of Income and Program Participation, the result shows that the career trajectory of U.S. workers has significantly changed since 1990 and, more importantly, the profiles of the changes have been remarkably different between internal mobility and external mobility. Most notably, occupational immobility has increased among workers who stayed in the same firm and decreased among workers who switched firms. To conclude, employment restructuring in the U.S. appears to have proceeded in a way that incorporates both functional flexibility and numerical flexibility, creating polarized groups of “organizational insiders” and “organizational outsiders.” As a result, workers’ career trajectories have been significantly transformed both inside and outside organizations."

While Yabunonaka’s three characters’ monologues are individually distinct, they maintain their unity and don’t affect each other. The splitting of Masago’s images towards the characters’ stakeholders is comprised of the old woman’s portrayal and Takehiro’s death. This is evident as these images are bonded and gathered in the paragraphs pertaining to old woman’s portrayal and Takehiro’s death. Just like the work of Theophile Gautier, it is not about one story of one woman, but rather, it is about Masago’s image depictions of one person’s woman who is not one person.

The obtained results revealed that VA reduced the corrosion of mild steel in both environments and inhibition efficiency increased with VA concentration but decreased with prolonged exposure. Electrochemical results showed that the extract functioned via mixed corrosion inhibiting mechanism by adsorption of some organic constituents of the extract on the metal/acid interface. Findings from infrared spectroscopy and electron microscopy all confirmed that VA retarded mild steel corrosion in both 1M HCl and 0.5M $H_2SO_4$ through an adsorption process. The adsorption behavior of selected constituents of the extract was modeled using density functional theory computations.

As part of these efforts, a plan for energy savings at the national level has been established. Large cities in each country are major energy consumers. In addition, architects of metropolitan high-rise towers, which are also major energy consumption sources, have committed to establishing institutional mechanisms to reduce the energy consumption of such buildings.  However, designs that consider energy performance have been limited to the introduction of conceptual technology. Energy-saving plans considering energy performance are generally established through heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems only after the design of the tower is determined. By analyzing the mass form determinants, except those for HVAC, in designing a tower, this study analyzed the correlation between the mass form determinants and energy performance of the tower, allowing designers to consider energy performance from the early design stages.  This study then attempted to analyze design strategies for efficient energy reduction, without relying on HVAC, in the phases prior to deciding on a design. In addition, this study attempted to transform the correlation into an equation using the typical floor plan, window area ratio, skin size, floor area, volume, floor height, story height, and aspect ratio, which determine the mass form in the early phase of design. By developing objective design indicators for energy performance based on this equation, this study could be used as basic material for rating the quality of energy performance-based designs, thereby contributing to the growth of low-carbon-footprint green construction."

Accordingly, recent study has dealt with the integral technique using the synchronous reference frame phase-locked-loop method. However, dynamic response is slow because it requires to monitor one period of grid voltage. In this paper, the dc offset error compensation algorithm of the improved response characteristic is proposed by using the synchronous reference frame phase-locked-loop.

In fashion, however, due to limitations in printing materials, size and speed, only parts of garments or fashion accessories are manufactured. This research aims to make millineries using domestic 3D printers for the development of their products. A design motif such as a ribbon is used as a playful element. Even if a familiar object, unaccustomed outlook attracts the viewer’s interest, and it naturally leads to interest of products, eventually contributing to the expansion of 3D printing products. Through literature and case studies of 3D printing fashion and millineries, ribbon, ribbon hat and 3D printed ribbon, three hats were produced. The results of the research show that: firstly, 3D printed ribbon is used aesthetically rather than functionally; secondly, ribbon is a useful item to make flat or 3-dimensional shape through CAD modelling; thirdly, ribbon can be used as a functional part of millinery. fourthly, 3D printing is easy to make a characteristic hat using CAD modelling from open source; fifthly, it is easy to attach other materials through modelling; sixthly, post processing can make 3D printed objects looked differently such as metal. Therefore, the ribbon is a useful item to draw viewers’ interest and an efficient item for 3D printing. The 3D printed hat using this motif is good for widening 3D printed products and can eventually contribute to the popularization of 3D printing products.

This paper aims to make assessment of this trends and its lessons. At the first, it is political basis, the response to plummeting support rate in 2008, that made Korean government to intervene microfinance, leading a transformation from NGOs type microfinance to financial type which is primarily operated by retired employee from commercial bank. Due to this background, Smile MicroCredit Bank recorded very low delinquency rate and much amount of outstanding loan. However, human capital network such as Relationship Manager excluded in the process of loan provision, Korea micro-finance tend to be divergent from its original purpose of poverty reduction and helping the poor. And also it experienced the problem of impaired fund by (-) ROA. In the context of this condition, we suggest three reconsideration about Korea micro-finance. First, is it proper to adapt foreign experience of micro-finance to Korea where saturated small self-management market is? Secondly we need to reconsider what the purpose of micro-finance in Korea is and how to supply credit. And finally is it appropriate for government to involve micro-finance like Smile MicroCredit Bank in Korea?"

To remedy the problem of word sparsity, a deep learning model is applied for features optimization by the employment of auto encoder and sparsity limitation. The proposed model is validated on the data set of I2B2 2010. The experiments give the evidence that the proposed model is effective and the method of features optimization with the deep learning model shows the great potential."

To enhance the recognition ratio of the proposed voice recognizer, ambient noise mixed into the voice signal has to be eliminated. However, noise filtering processes, which may damage voice data, diminishes the recognition ratio. In this paper, a filter has been designed for the frequency range within a voice signal, and imposed weights are used to reduce data deterioration. In addition, a deep learning algorithm, which does not require a database in the recognition algorithm, has been adapted for embedded systems, which inherently require small amounts of memory. The experimental results suggest that the proposed deep learning algorithm and HMM voice recognizer, utilizing the proposed adaptive MFCC algorithm, perform better than conventional MFCC algorithms in its recognition ratio within a noisy environment."

deformable mr prostate segmentation via deep feature learning and sparse patch matching,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Automatic and reliable segmentation of the prostate is an important but difficult task for various clinical applications such as prostate cancer radiotherapy. The main challenges for accurate MR prostate localization lie in two aspects: (1) inhomogeneous and inconsistent appearance around prostate boundary, and (2) the large shape variation across different patients. To tackle these two problems, we propose a new deformable MR prostate segmentation method by unifying deep feature learning with the sparse patch matching. First, instead of directly using handcrafted features, we propose to learn the latent feature representation from prostate MR images by the stacked sparse auto-encoder (SSAE). Since the deep learning algorithm learns the feature hierarchy from the data, the learned features are often more concise and effective than the handcrafted features in describing the underlying data. To improve the discriminability of learned features, we further refine the feature representation in a supervised fashion. Second, based on the learned features, a sparse patch matching method is proposed to infer a prostate likelihood map by transferring the prostate labels from multiple atlases to the new prostate MR image. Finally, a deformable segmentation is used to integrate a sparse shape model with the prostate likelihood map for achieving the final segmentation. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated on the dataset that contains 66 T2-wighted prostate MR images. Experimental results show that the deep-learned features are more effective than the handcrafted features in guiding MR prostate segmentation. Moreover, our method shows superior performance than other state-of-the-art segmentation methods. Index Terms-Deformable</P>"
scalable high-performance image registration framework by unsupervised deep feature representations learning,2016,"['Deep learning', 'deformable image registration', 'hierarchical feature representation']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Feature selection is a critical step in deformable image registration. In particular, selecting the most discriminative features that accurately and concisely describe complex morphological patterns in image patches improves correspondence detection, which in turn improves image registration accuracy. Furthermore, since more and more imaging modalities are being invented to better identify morphological changes in medical imaging data, the development of deformable image registration method that scales well to new image modalities or new image applications with little to no human intervention would have a significant impact on the medical image analysis community. To address these concerns, a learning-based image registration framework is proposed that uses deep learning to discover compact and highly discriminative features upon observed imaging data. Specifically, the proposed feature selection method uses a convolutional stacked autoencoder to identify intrinsic deep feature representations in image patches. Since deep learning is an unsupervised learning method, no ground truth label knowledge is required. This makes the proposed feature selection method more flexible to new imaging modalities since feature representations can be directly learned from the observed imaging data in a very short amount of time. Using the LONI and ADNI imaging datasets, image registration performance was compared to two existing state-of-the-art deformable image registration methods that use handcrafted features. To demonstrate the scalability of the proposed image registration framework, image registration experiments were conducted on 7.0-T brain MR images. In all experiments, the results showed that the new image registration framework consistently demonstrated more accurate registration results when compared to state of the art.</P>"
deep sparse multi-task learning for feature selection in alzheimer’s disease diagnosis,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Recently, neuroimaging-based Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnosis has attracted researchers in the field, due to the increasing prevalence of the diseases. Unfortunately, the unfavorable high-dimensional nature of neuroimaging data, but a limited small number of samples available, makes it challenging to build a robust computer-aided diagnosis system. Machine learning techniques have been considered as a useful tool in this respect and, among various methods, sparse regression has shown its validity in the literature. However, to our best knowledge, the existing sparse regression methods mostly try to select features based on the optimal regression coefficients in one step. We argue that since the training feature vectors are composed of both informative and uninformative or less informative features, the resulting optimal regression coefficients are inevidently affected by the uninformative or less informative features. To this end, we first propose a novel deep architecture to recursively discard uninformative features by performing sparse multi-task learning in a hierarchical fashion. We further hypothesize that the optimal regression coefficients reflect the relative importance of features in representing the target response variables. In this regard, we use the optimal regression coefficients learned in one hierarchy as feature weighting factors in the following hierarchy, and formulate a weighted sparse multi-task learning method. Lastly, we also take into account the distributional characteristics of samples per class and use clustering-induced subclass label vectors as target response values in our sparse regression model. In our experiments on the ADNI cohort, we performed both binary and multi-class classification tasks in AD/MCI diagnosis and showed the superiority of the proposed method by comparing with the state-of-the-art methods.</P>"

toward a deeper level of learning in sport and leisure studies: supporting students in becoming self-regulated and transformative learners,2016,"['Deep learning', 'self-regulated learner', 'transformative learner']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Purpose: Students in the field of sport and leisure are active and responsible participants in their own learning. In order to reach a deeper level of learning, students must be fully engaged in their own learning and its outcomes. Self-regulated leaners (i.e., students who are autonomous in their learning) tend to integrate their self-generated thoughts, feelings, and behaviors into their own academic skills. Transformative learners (i.e., reflexive students who are continuously reflecting on and being critical of their own learning) tend to care about their future “becoming” (e.g., being an ethical practitioner in the field of sport and leisure) and “living” (e.g., pursuing ethical professional practices in sport and leisure contexts). Inspiring students, and then helping them translate that passion into proficiency in various subject areas in the field of sport and leisure, are thus keys to the success in post-secondary education. This study aimed at exploring various ways of promoting self-regulated and transformative learning among sport and leisure post-secondary students. Method: Action learning (i.e., an inquiry approach focusing on “bringing people together to learn from each other’s experiences”; Kemmis & McTaggart, 2005, p. 561) and narrative inquiry (i.e., a study of experience aimed at enriching and transforming experiences by writing, sharing, and collaboratively reflecting on stories of one’s lived experience; Clandinin & Connelly, 2000) were utilized. Result: Critical moments, reflexive insights, and transformed practices were captured thorough narrative writings and will be shared during presentation. Examples of engaging in problem solving (e.g., case study approaches to real-world situations), problem posing (e.g., critical writing assignments on controversial issues in current professional practices), and scaffolding approaches (e.g., opportunities for students to share or link their daily experiences to course content) will also be showcased to highlight various practical strategies to support students in becoming self-regulated and transformative learners. Conclusion: This presentation would offer audiences a vicarious experience in which their experiential background is enlarged to engage in various pedagogic approaches that promote self-regulated and transformative learning in their own academic programs."

deep ls-svm for regression,2016,"['Deep learning', 'hidden layer', 'least squares support vector machine', 'multi-layer neural network', 'penalized objective function.']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In this paper, we propose a deep least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) for regression problems, which consists of the input layer and the hidden layer. In the hidden layer, LS-SVMs are trained with the original input variables and the perturbed responses. For the final output, the main LS-SVM is trained with the outputs from LS-SVMs of the hidden layer as input variables and the original responses. In contrast to the multilayer neural network (MNN), LS-SVMs in the deep LS-SVM are trained to minimize the penalized objective function. Thus, the learning dynamics of the deep LS-SVM are entirely different from MNN in which all weights and biases are trained to minimize one final error function. When compared to MNN approaches, the deep LS-SVM does not make use of any combination weights, but trains all LS-SVMs in the architecture. Experimental results from real datasets illustrate that the deep LS- SVM significantly outperforms state of the art machine learning methods on regression problems."
machine learning approaches to corn yield estimation using satellite images and climate data: a case of iowa state,2016,"['Crop Yield', 'Machine Learning', 'Remote Sensing', 'Climate Data']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Remote sensing data has been widely used in the estimation of crop yields by employing statistical methods such as regression model. Machine learning, which is an efficient empirical method for classification and prediction, is another approach to crop yield estimation. This paper described the corn yield estimation in Iowa State using four machine learning approaches such as SVM (Support Vector Machine), RF (Random Forest), ERT (Extremely Randomized Trees) and DL (Deep Learning). Also, comparisons of the validation statistics among them were presented. To examine the seasonal sensitivities of the corn yields, three period groups were set up: (1) MJJAS (May to September), (2) JA (July and August) and (3) OC (optimal combination of month). In overall, the DL method showed the highest accuracies in terms of the correlation coefficient for the three period groups. The accuracies were relatively favorable in the OC group, which indicates the optimal combination of month can be significant in statistical modeling of crop yields. The differences between our predictions and USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) statistics were about 6-8 %, which shows the machine learning approaches can be a viable option for crop yield modeling. In particular, the DL showed more stable results by overcoming the overfitting problem of generic machine learning methods."

deep neural network with weight sparsity control and pre-training extracts hierarchical features and enhances classification performance: evidence from whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity patterns of schizophrenia,2016,"['Deep learning', 'Functional connectivity', 'Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sparsity', 'Stacked autoencoder']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Functional connectivity (FC) patterns obtained from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data are commonly employed to study neuropsychiatric conditions by using pattern classifiers such as the support vector machine (SVM). Meanwhile, a deep neural network (DNN) with multiple hidden layers has shown its ability to systematically extract lower-to-higher level information of image and speech data from lower-to-higher hidden layers, markedly enhancing classification accuracy. The objective of this study was to adopt the DNN for whole-brain resting-state FC pattern classification of schizophrenia (SZ) patients vs. healthy controls (HCs) and identification of aberrant FC patterns associated with SZ. We hypothesized that the lower-to-higher level features learned via the DNN would significantly enhance the classification accuracy, and proposed an adaptive learning algorithm to explicitly control the weight sparsity in each hidden layer via L<SUB>1</SUB>-norm regularization. Furthermore, the weights were initialized via stacked autoencoder based pre-training to further improve the classification performance. Classification accuracy was systematically evaluated as a function of (1) the number of hidden layers/nodes, (2) the use of L<SUB>1</SUB>-norm regularization, (3) the use of the pre-training, (4) the use of framewise displacement (FD) removal, and (5) the use of anatomical/functional parcellation. Using FC patterns from anatomically parcellated regions without FD removal, an error rate of 14.2% was achieved by employing three hidden layers and 50 hidden nodes with both L<SUB>1</SUB>-norm regularization and pre-training, which was substantially lower than the error rate from the SVM (22.3%). Moreover, the trained DNN weights (i.e., the learned features) were found to represent the hierarchical organization of aberrant FC patterns in SZ compared with HC. Specifically, pairs of nodes extracted from the lower hidden layer represented sparse FC patterns implicated in SZ, which was quantified by using kurtosis/modularity measures and features from the higher hidden layer showed holistic/global FC patterns differentiating SZ from HC. Our proposed schemes and reported findings attained by using the DNN classifier and whole-brain FC data suggest that such approaches show improved ability to learn hidden patterns in brain imaging data, which may be useful for developing diagnostic tools for SZ and other neuropsychiatric disorders and identifying associated aberrant FC patterns."

This system is an ideal choice for this investigation since the bulb circuit is well characterized, allowing for an accurate definition of activity patterns in order to train the model. We generated models for both cerebral blood volume weighted (CBVw) and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI data.

Furthermore, the activation maps computed by CBVw and BOLD data show increased agreement when using the learned models, lending more confidence to their accuracy.

Yet there are terror attacks, religious disputes and other conflicts continuously taking place on larger and larger scales as well as expanding further and further throughout the world. Interreligious harmony seems like a distant ideal. What is the ultimate cause of religious conflicts? Is interreligious communication truly that difficult? Even among different cultures, said cultures' varieties of ritual expressions, and various religious doctrines, there are points of general common to be appreciated if a deep perspective is adopted. When we find the common ground and understand each other's difference, it will be easier to communicate since everyone will be learning from each other. What could serve as common ground for different religions? Many scholars speak about the state of ‘oneness’ that is claimed by mysticism throughout a large array of religions. This state of oneness is typically not achieved overnight, but it serves as a prospective state which is pluralistically inclusive. This ""religion of enlightenment"" emphasizes the process of reaching comprehensive interreligious agreement would be characterized by a deep religious perspective. If superficial religious perspectives focuses only on faith to attain blessings and engage in blind belief, then, by contrast, deep religious perspectives emphasize inner divinity, the true self, orthe higher self.The words, ‘superficial religious perspective’ and ‘deep religious perspective’ were defined for personal convenience by O Gang-nam, a scholar of comparative religion. Consequently, this classification is a relative binary concept lacking hard and fast rules with regards to distinctions. But the concept of superficial religious perspectives and deep religious perspectives has its advantage in allowing clearer and easier discussion about religions because it could embrace all aspects of religious life and the development of various religious sentiment. In this way, the terms surface religious perspectives and deep religious perspectives will be used in limited framework. I both borrow this concept and reconsider it by referring to other scholars' methods of classification. From that point, I explore and these views in relation to religious experience.How does religiosity develop, maturity of religious faith take place, deep awareness of truth reveal itself, or an attitude of open-mindedness arise? After these states are realized, is interreligious agreement possible? Most religious studies scholars point out ‘religious experience.’ They say people could develop their faith from superficial religious beliefs into a more mature and deeper faith through religious experience while continuously aspiring towards enlightenment and practicing their religion in daily life.This study will try to examine aspects of superficial religious perspectives and deep religious perspectives represented in each religion and also explore criticism of each religion.

Sixty-nine undergraduate students were randomly assigned to seven teams and they participated in a three week online discussion. Communication self-efficacy, cognitive engagement, and perceived learning achievement were measured by using a self-reporting questionnaire and degree centrality was calculated through NetMiner 4.0. After data collection, descriptive statistic analysis, correlation analysis, multiple regression analysis, hierarchical regression analysis, and bootstrapping were conducted. However communication self-efficacy and in-degree centrality were excluded from the multiple regression analysis, mediating effects analysis, and bootstrapping because they have no significant correlation with the other variables. The results showed that surface strategy use negatively predicted out-degree centrality and deep strategy use and out-degree centrality significantly predicted perceived learning achievement. Out-degree centrality partially mediated the relationship between deep strategy use and perceived learning achievement, and fully mediated the relationship between surface strategy use and perceived learning achievement. Therefore, in online discussion, learners should make good use of deep strategy but also should be encouraged to avoid surface strategy use. Also, it implies that there needs to be an understanding of the mechanism between attribute variables and relational variables when researching the effects of learner characteristics in online discussion."

Baduk has a symbolic significance as it represents the highest limit of human intellectual ability, and has remained so until this day. The game is also the holy grail of artificial intelligence (AI). For this research study, we analyzed Baduk matches that took place between AlphaGo, a supercomputer, and Lee Sedol, one of the top Baduk players in the world, as well as examining archival research in order to discuss learning capabilities and the appropriate learning techniques for students in the age of AI. In March 2016, AlphaGo played against Lee and beat him, and he was arguably the world’s best Baduk player (professional nine-dan level) in Google’s DeepMind Challenge Match. During the match, AlphaGo introduced a new model in Baduk as its play deviated significantly from the common plays of professional Baduk players. The age in which AI surpasses human intelligence is considered to be a point of “singularity” in the history of human civilization. A singularity is a term denoting an unknown territory in which we cannot make easy predictions. In order to prepare for the new age of AI, we may have to go back to the beginning of human civilization to learn from the wisdom of the educational system of the ancients. To be specific, to prepare for this new age, we can learn from Baduk education of ancient China and the Paideia education of ancient Greece, from which we can deduce the strengths kept within human nature."

In the past, Philosophy, the flower of all studies, was relegated to the status of feudal lord while related fields such as aesthetics, ethics, religious study, etc. were distributed as the fiefs.Philosophy has also entereda crisis period similar to the modern decline of the humanities at universities . However, the crisis facing philosophy can be seen as an opportunity depending on the mindset. Then, how can the realm of philosophy, which distributed its territory to related studies, become territorialized again? The answer may lie in the restoration of desperateness as a way to rekindle the love of wisdom by starting with the fundamental ideas of philosophy. The same is true for Buddhist philosophy as part of philosophy. We should restore and promote the desperate attitudes of Beomcheon (梵天) who strived to gain insight into Jungdohaeng (中道行 Middle Way) and Yeongibeop (緣起法 law of causality) after the Buddha hesitated to preach following his enlightenment.For that, the precondition is the constant pursuit and learning topography and methodologies of Buddhist philosophy as part of philosophy. We need to ask and learn about Buddhism and Buddhist philosophy with a renewed mind by sticking to the globally adopted principle of 5W1H (who, what, where, when, why, how), on the basis of general philosophy classified largely into Western philosophy, Indian philosophy, and Chinese philosophy. Then, we will be able to discuss and 철학으로서 불교철학의 지형과 방법 / 고영섭 119 communicate more effectively through extensive inquiry about subject theory corresponding to existentialism of Western philosophy which is regarded as the universal language of Korea’s information-based society, theory of human nature corresponding to epistemology, and discipline theory corresponding to the theory of value.By doing so, we can reexamine the foundation of Buddhism and contemplate the roots of Buddhist philosophy. As Bunghwang Wonhyo (617~686) suggested, learning is the mission and duty of the person who is learning. Those who pursue learning, the abstruse meaning of scriptures containing the profound thoughts of Tathagata, should open the scripture and explore the meaning of Tripitaka with intense vigor. To explore the meaning of this literature, i.e., Tripitaka, we should develop a profound understanding of literary methodologies and apply a broad hermeneutical approach to understanding the true meaning of the literature. Learning is the mission and duty of the person pursuing the Tao. The person pursuing the Tao seeks to return to the foundation of single-mindedness after passing through various mental boundaries and obstacles. To pass through these various boundaries, self-reflection is a prerequisite.Self-reflection is based on the profound understanding of literature, which is based on learning and the broad interpretation of literature. Thus, there should be no pursuit of Tao without the pursuit of learning.As learning is the constant process of inquiry and acquiring knowledge, we can learn extensively by asking questions in detail. Those who pursue Tao are philosophers. If philosophy is the pursuit of learning, then philosophy represents the pursuit of Tao. Tao is the way of those living and enjoying by this way. As philosophy is the love of wisdom and learning is the process of asking and learning, we should pursue learning to follow the true path of Tao. We can climb to the path of Tao with deep insight into Application Study and Practical Study only when we become followers of the Tao who are well acquainted with literature and hermeneutics.

The greater network may get the study task done well, while it may increase network computation overhead easier and cost more. Hence, network construction is an important issue, as well as a difficult problem. In this paper, we proposed a novel sensitivity-based adaptive architecture pruning algorithm for Madalines. The algorithm establishes a pruning measure based on the network sensitivity to its structure variation and a minimal disturbance principle. The measure can be used to evaluate the performance loss due to its structure changes more or less. And the loss can be compensated by relearning. Thus, the new adaptive pruning mechanism is developed with measuring, pruning, and compensating. The simulation experimental results based on some benchmark data demonstrate that the pruning measure is rationality and the new algorithm is effective."

Considered as one of the most destructive natural disasters ever recorded, it had far-reaching consequences. When news of the Lisbon quake spread, it inspired an intellectual debate, not only in Portugal but in all of Europe, about the natural world and God`s place in human affairs. Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Immanuel Kant etc. took up the disaster as a vehicle to express their own Enlightenment ideas. In this article I focus on the controversy between Voltaire and Rousseau on the Lisbon earthquake. Voltaire learns, at the end of November 1755, that Lisbon undergoes an earthquake such a magnitude that the victims amount “a hundred thousand”, and, in early December, he composes in Alexandrine verse “Poem on the Lisbon disaster. Or an Examination of the Axiom, `All is Well`”. This French philosopher criticise, in his “Poem”, Leibniz`s concept of theodicy as well as the axiom of Alexander Pope “Whatever is, is right.”, suggesting that the massive destruction of the “unhappy mortals”, victims of the Lisbon earthquake demonstrated that God was not providing the “best of all possible worlds”. Then the quarrel festers when Rousseau contradicts, in a reply to the poem of Voltaire, the concept of providence exposed in the “Poem”. For Rousseau, it is not God but human beings and their civilization who are really responsible for this enormous sacrifice. First of all, I indicate the points of dispute between the two philosophers. Then, I try to reveal the deep-rooted reasons of the difference which results from differences in their world-views as well as their religious viewpoints. Finally, I bring to light the implication of the controversy in terms of the formation of the Enlightenment."

In this paper, based on these objective indicators, the characteristics of those used in each example and the features of the back side of each used example are examined. This is similar in relation of Signifier and Signifee in semiotics. In this paper, focusing on Signifier, patterns of “change(變)” found in ≪Zhuang-zi≫are learned.. This work was approached structurally in connection with ‘nature(自然)’. Unlike the other ideas, “Change(變)” in ≪Zhuang-zi≫ has a deep connection with nature. Zhuang-zi discovered the changes in nature, and it was philosophically sublimated through the reason in that place. Phenomenon changed, but the principles and the source of its back has always maintenance. Knowing Tao and Reaching the state of acquaintances is possible when one interacts with the maintenance to face the changes, This can be still valid to be applied to the modern world. To observe the nature and to apply the Tao of the change to the human society seems in line with analogical and correlative characters of Oriental Thought. Humans can not live away from nature. At large human beings also is a natural after all. As the correlative thoughts has been extended to Chinese medical to heal human body, the natural principles of “Change(變)” observed in nature also can be extended correlatively to treat human and cure human society meaningfully. So today even though fatigue of change is experienced here, the philosophy of ‘change’ in ≪Zhuang-zi≫ can present a plan of solving the problem faced in this era beyond refreshing to us."

Although Korea has been operating for years a couple of informal channels for discussion of major themes in its macroeconomy and finance including macroprudential policy issues relating to systemic risk and financial stability, recent evidence shows that they cannot be relied upon at all to serve the role of the macroprudential policy authorities. This stands in s contrast to the fact that many countries each have already been formally operating their own institutional arrangements for macroprudential policy, on the heels of the global financial crisis. This paper aims at designing the Korean institutional framework for macroprudential policy that should meet the basic requirements for the effective conduct of macroprudential policy and, at the same time, be adequately attuned to the institutional realities in Korea. In order to do so, Section II provides a literature review, which leads us to the finding that central banks are generally expected either to be charged with macroprudential policy as the competent authority or to play at least an important role therein. The emphasis given to the role of central banks reflects the general understanding that the effective conduct of macroprudential policy requires “a strong institutional framework” that should be built on both the “willingness to act” and the “ability to act.” Further, several typologies of stylized theoretic models found in the literature are briefly reviewed and discussed. On the basis of this literature review and in full consideration of institutional realities in Korea, Section III of the paper comes up with a two-step minimalist approach in its exploration of an appropriate model that should suit Korea properly and effectively. As a result, the paper finds one in the two-party council, tentatively titled the Macroprudential Policy Council (MaPC), in which participate the Bank of Korea (BOK) as the cental bank on one hand, and both the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) as the prudential regulator on the other. Note that in line with the paper`s minimalist approach MaPC consists of the two core authorities including BOK and FSC/FSS, with the Ministry of Finance and Strategy (MOSF) excluded. This feature is embedded in the model in view of the deep-rooted Confucianist cultural tradition in Korea where “the vertical institutional hierarchy” has long been entrenched. As long as the macroprudential policy framework is mandated to deal with the prevention side of crisis only, the two parties will suffice. In addition, this minimalist approach will contribute to mitigating effectively such inherent tendencies as “group-think” to which multi-agency councils are deemed vulnerable. The two-party council may well have considerable significance in the sense that it can be interpreted to be a natural arrangement resulting from the process of institutional evolution, as was evidenced in case of the Council for Cooperation on Macroprudential Policy that existed, though briefly, in Sweden for a couple of years back in 2012 and 2013. Note also that in line with the paper`s two-step approach MaPC is designed to take its first step to the beginning stage which allows each participant to buy enough time to get adjusted and prepared before taking its second step to move on to the completion stage. This feature importantly reflects the fact that BOK currently leaves much to be improved in terms of its willingness and ability to act, whereas FSC, along with the FSS, needs to learn how to cooperate and coordinate with BOK in macroprudential policy. In the first stage, BOK is left with few policy tools of its own to be used distinctively for the macroprudential policy purposes, while FSC/FSS, in their capacity of microprudential policy authorities, own and control most macroprudential tools. In the second stage, however, a few cyclical macroprudential tools could be assigned to BOK, which is generally expected to hold comparative advantage in analyzing and dealing with, if anything, the cyclical dimension of systemic risk. What is particularly unique about MaPC lies in a couple of specific rules that govern its modus operandi. The Council is supposed to apply either the `consultation` rule or the `positive endorsement` rule, depending on whether a proposed item on the agenda one party submits to MaPC for discussion is to request, via consultation, the other to act, or to seek positive endorsement from the other so as to carry out one`s own plan to act. Once it is either consulted or positively endorsed as the case may be, the submission will have become a recommendation issued in public by the Council with its addressee being obliged to `comply or explain`. Considering that most policy tools are in the hands of the financial supervisory authorities, these specific rules governing MaPC are contrived mainly for the purpose of ensuring BOK to exert checks and balances effectively upon FSC/FSS. Finally provided in Section IV are conclusive remarks on potential merits and limits of the institutional framework which this paper has proposed."

could decimal-binary vector be a representative of dna sequence for classification?,2016,"['Bioinformatics', 'DNA Sequence Classification', 'Deep Learning', 'Deep Belief Network', 'Restricted Boltzmann Machine']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In recent years, one of deep learning models called Deep Belief Network (DBN) which formed by stacking restricted Boltzman machine in a greedy fashion has beed widely used for classification and recognition.

In this research, we assess the applicability of deep learning in dna classification level. Since the training phase of DBN is costly expensive, specially if deals with DNA sequence with thousand of variables, we introduce a new encoding method, using decimal-binary vector to represent the sequence as input to the model, thereafter compare with one-hot-vector encoding in two datasets. We evaluated our proposed model with different contrastive algorithms which achieved significant improvement for the training speed with comparable classification result.

DBN has an advantage that initial weights are set by unsupervised learning, so this compensates for the defects of artificial neural networks. We used past precipitation, temperature, and the parameters of the sun and moon""s motion as features for forecasting precipitation. The dataset consists of observation data which had been measured for 40 years from AWS in Seoul. Experiments were based on 8-fold cross validation. As a result of estimation, we got probabilities of test dataset, so threshold was used for the decision of precipitation. CSI and Bias were used for indicating the precision of precipitation.

Based on the spherical signature description of each point, the extractor of significant environmental features is learned by the Deep Belief Nets for the urban structure classification. Arbitrary point among the 3D point cloud can represents its signature in its sky surface by using several neighborhood points. The unit spherical surface centered on that point can be considered to accumulate the evidence of each angular tessellation. According to a kind of point area such as wall, ground, tree, car, and so on, the results of spherical signature description look so different each other. These data can be applied into the Deep Belief Nets, which is one of the Deep Neural Networks, for learning the environmental feature extractor. With this learned feature extractor, 3D points can be classified due to its urban structures well.

What is theoretically at stake in this task is to find a way of integrating imagination and rationality in teaching and learning knowledge, the roles of which have been wrongly considered separate and even contradictory in the function of the human mind. To do so, it first reconstructs a Canadian educational philosopher Kieran Egan`s philosophically historical review of the concept of imagination. This will lead us to establish an educationally constructive concept of imagination, the concept which has been traditionally underestimated in its educational utility due to its subordinated status to reason or rationality in constituting human consciousness or intentionality. Secondly, it will examine Lev Vygotsky`s developmental theory of imagination to draw some pedagogical implications in teaching and learning, namely how to develop and foster imagination in an educationally meaningful manner. The reconstruction of Egan`s view on the conceptual development of imagination will show how the concept has been evolved along with the change in our world view, making a shift from the secondary human faculty being in service of the absolute God in the pre-modern world gradually into the primary human faculty to construct and create human meanings and values as the source of active thinking in the modern world. Parallel to the conceptual shift, our examination of Vygotsky`s theory of imagination traces his ideas on how the imagination in childhood develops into the imagination in the adolescent; the imagination in two stages takes completely different forms and paths in their development. According to Vygotsky, the imagination in the adolescent is critical to the development of the higher mental functions of human faculties including conceptual thinking, which has been one of the critical concern in knowledge education. Here the distinction and collaboration between visual conceptualization as a form of generalization and abstract conceptualization as a form of abstraction are addressed with a great importance to reveal their independent and interactive roles in the higher functions of the human mind. Lastly, this essay concludes with Egan`s idea of deep learning, which shows the importance of imagination in knowledge education.

When used in the curriculum, danso has many great advantages. It is very portable, has a tranquil tone, and helps one practice one’s self-control exercise through abdominal breathing, a deep, long breathing skill. Although it is being replaced with the sogeum because it is relatively difficult to make sounds and requires great patience during practice, danso still plays an important role as an introduction to the Korean traditional music.The number of people who can play danso has increased since danso education became part of the school curriculum. However, there is room for reconsideration of whether there has been improvements in quality of danso performance. There are many reasons for this, but one of the main reasons is the importance of the textbook. For danso learning experience in a school environment to carry on into everyday life, the improvement of textbook approachability and development of textbooks for different performance levels are inevitable.This research first examines 44 textbooks out of the various danso music scores and textbooks published after the liberation of Korea, by dividing them into theory, music classification and analysis. Then textbooks with a high ratio of folk songs were selected and compared in a musical, contextual setting. The findings indicated that the section of performing techniques such as fingering, body positioning and how to make sounds and lip shape was generally well described, but there was an insufficient amount of contents as regards with breathing method. As for learning method, learning through different levels of difficulty was proposed, and as for curriculum and textbook connection, it was observed that there was a higher ratio of traditional children’s songs since the 7th Revised National Music Ceducational Curriculum. As for music classification and analysis, levels can be classified into beginner, intermediate and advanced, depending on the level of difficulty of music. What is noteworthy is that Kyonggi folk songs took up a high percentage, and, as a result, there is an imbalance in the weight put on various folk songs. Based on these observations, it is verified that developing danso textbooks for different levels is necessary. Moreover, we propose placing equal amounts of music from various geographic regions, utilizing ensembles and developing separate textbooks for pyeongjol danso and improved danso."

data randomization and cluster-based partitioning for botnet intrusion detection,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Botnets, which consist of remotely controlled compromised machines called bots, provide a distributed platform for several threats against cyber world entities and enterprises. Intrusion detection system (IDS) provides an efficient countermeasure against botnets. It continually monitors and analyzes network traffic for potential vulnerabilities and possible existence of active attacks. A payload-inspection-based IDS (PI-IDS) identifies active intrusion attempts by inspecting transmission control protocol and user datagram protocol packet's payload and comparing it with previously seen attacks signatures. However, the PI-IDS abilities to detect intrusions might be incapacitated by packet encryption. Traffic-based IDS (T-IDS) alleviates the shortcomings of PI-IDS, as it does not inspect packet payload; however, it analyzes packet header to identify intrusions. As the network's traffic grows rapidly, not only the detection-rate is critical, but also the efficiency and the scalability of IDS become more significant. In this paper, we propose a state-of-the-art T-IDS built on a novel randomized data partitioned learning model (RDPLM), relying on a compact network feature set and feature selection techniques, simplified subspacing and a multiple randomized meta-learning technique. The proposed model has achieved 99.984% accuracy and 21.38 s training time on a well-known benchmark botnet dataset. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms other well-known machine-learning models used in the same detection task, namely, sequential minimal optimization, deep neural network, C4.5, reduced error pruning tree, and randomTree.</P>"

In content organization, middle school history is organized by focusing on a subject, so is different from Korean history in high school constructed with syntax structure focusing on political history. In content construction, middle school history, Korean history in high school, world history, and East Asian history are divided into five fields, and a method that big idea(key concept) is made as an organizer of contents so is made as the central axis penetrating grade is selected. Five results that content construction of 2015 revised middle school history curriculum is analyzed by focusing on characteristics and problems of key competencies becoming a reference frame of a curriculum, big idea playing a role of a content organizer, and validity of content construction focusing on a subject can be arranged. First, a clear concept of key competencies is not agreed yet. In addition, there is no significant differences between key subject competences suggested in a history curriculum and historical thinking, and key subject competences are also impertinent to be made as standards of content selection and construction of a curriculum. Second, ‘big idea(key concept)’ suggested as a frame of content construction is a super ordinate concept involving various concepts, so content elements based on individually historical truths are selected as key concept in comparison to a constituting principle of a curriculum enabling deep learning as an organizer combining fields in a subject, so it goes against a principle of a curriculum. Key concept constituting fields has the meaning of simple content elements, and is closer to characteristic as a subject rather than a concept. In addition, it is difficult to find a community combining Korean history and world history, and the meaning as an organizer connecting historical contents is weak. Third, the intention to constitute historical contents in middle school by focusing on a subject is to differentiate contents in middle school from contents in high school. However, when a study on a sequence method is referred, it is organized by focusing on a subject in middle school because syntax structure understanding the flow of history is better fitted for a method retrogressing an understanding of students in middle school. A subject is the meaning as learning experience that students can investigate a particular subject deeply in the learning process rather than a content construction principle of a curriculum, so is impertinent to be made as a content construction principle of a curriculum. Fourth, if detailed purposes, field system table, and achievement standards of a history curriculum are examined, a difference of content construction between middle school history and Korean history in high school is not clear, and there is a problem that political history should be repeated for elementary, middle, and high schools. Fifth, a method to reduce scope and contents treated in a world history field is selected to lighten academic pressure of students. As a result, the world history field does not treat history except for Chinese history, European history, and some of Japanese history in middle school history. This is because the reality of history education is not properly understood, so finally, this will cause desolation of world history education."

Excluding the imagery training, both groups were placed under the same conditions and received the same information. Frequency, exploratory factor, reliability, independent samples t-test, and a paired samples t-test, qualitative analysis (open questionnaire, deep interview, and observation journals) were conducted for analyzing data. In results, there was a significantly difference in the dance class satisfaction in terms of educational satisfaction factor (t=2.60*), societal satisfaction factor (t=3.18**), program satisfaction factor (t=2.64**), and psychological satisfaction factor (t=2.12*); only in the imagery training group, there was a difference between the pre-test and post-test results for educational satisfaction factor (t=3.65***), societal satisfaction factor (t=4.77***), psychological satisfaction factor (t=2.15*). The effects of imagery on students in general dance education affected ""movement memory"" (remembering order, self-correcting), ""self-confidence"" (increasing commitment, increasing learning motivation), ""motor performance"" (increasing of exercise adaptive ability, learning by thinking). Thus, if proper imagery education were to be a priority, we can expect positive learning when using imagery as a class tool in general dance education."

Unlike general MLP regularization methods assuming that a regression function is smooth, the proposed regularization method is also valid when a regression function has discontinuities (non-smoothness). Since a true regression function to be learned is unknown, we examine a training set with our Bayesian approach that identifies non-smooth data, analyzing discontinuities in a regression function. The use of a Bayesian probability distribution identifies the non-smooth data. These identified data is used in a proposed objective function to fit an MLP response to the desired regression function regardless of its smoothness and noise. Experimental simulations show that the MLP with our presented training method yields more accurate fits to non-smooth functions than other MLP training methods. Further, we show that the suggested training methodology can be incorporated with deep learning models."

dnn-based feature enhancement using doa-constrained ica for robust speech recognition,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) system is often degraded in adverse real-world environments. In recent times, deep learning has successfully emerged as a breakthrough for acoustic modeling in ASR; accordingly, deep neural network (DNN)-based speech feature enhancement (FE) approaches have attracted much attention owing to their powerful modeling capabilities. However, DNN-based approaches are unable to achieve remarkable performance improvements for speech with severe distortion in the test environments different from training environments. In this letter, we propose a DNN-based FE method where the DNN inputs include preenhanced spectral features computed from multichannel input signals to reconstruct noise-robust features. The preenhanced spectral features are obtained by direction-of-arrival (DOA)-constrained independent component analysis (DCICA) followed by Bayesian FE using a hidden-Markov-model prior, to exploit the capabilities of efficient online target speech extraction and efficient FE with prior information for robust ASR. In addition, noise spectral features computed from DCICA are included for further improvement. Therefore, the DNN is trained to reconstruct a clean spectral feature vector, from a sequence of corrupted input feature vectors in addition to the corresponding preenhanced and noise feature vectors. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves recognition performance, even in mismatched noise conditions.</P>"

In those sites, CO2 was artificially injected around the shallow aquifer region as CO2-infused groundwater phase or gas phase for identifying environmental effects caused by CO2 injection. This paper reviews the hydraulic heterogeneity, mineral compositions, monitoring systems, and environmental parameters required for leakage detection at each site. For constructing a controlled test bed, inclined wells, horizontal wells, and multiple injection wells were identified as reliable injection components. It was also identified that the injected CO2 migration and its effects were monitored through the constructed monitoring networks.The previous operation cases show that continuous monitoring of pH, electrical conductivity (EC), Ca and Mg concentrations is the most basic and important factor for leakage detection. Trace elements and isotopes were also widely used to determine the CO2 leakage.The Korea CO2 Storage Environmental Management (K-COSEM) research center is going to construct an environmental impact test (EIT) facility for developing CO2 leakage detection methods in a shallow aquifer region in Korea. The challenging issues will include the fate and transport of CO2 from the fractured zone to the saturated zone and to the unsaturated soil. Based on the lessons learned from the previous tests, environmental monitoring technologies will be developed through the analysis of the time series data of hydrogeochemical parameters for the planned EIT facility in Korea."

A time complexity of the pointer networks is O(N²) resulting in longer decoding time of the model. This is because the model calculates attention for each input, if size of the input sequence is N. In this paper, we propose the pointer networks based on skip pointing model, which confirms the necessary input vector at decoding for reducing the decoding time of the pointer networks. Furthermore, experiments were conducted for the pronouns coreference resolution, which uses the method proposed in this paper.

bridging constructivist theories and design practice for children to grow as active technology users,2016,"['Technology', 'Children', 'Development Theory', 'Constructivist Theory', 'Children Computer Interaction']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Background Technology has become pervasive in our lives and children’s development is closely affected by using it. Technology designs for children should be based on a deep understanding of children and their development. A closer link between developmental theories and design practice is needed to meet children’s needs and to support them to become active learners and users of technology.  Methods This research reviews constructivist theories, specifically the cognitive constructivism and social constructivism of Piaget, Papert, and Vygotsky. These theories suggest a perspective to see children as active agents who interact with their environment and learn through it. The theories explain how children develop through cognitive, physical, and social experiences, and give insights for design practices.  Results By reviewing the theories, this research suggests implications for designing technology for children: 1) technology should support children’s developmental needs; 2) technology should be personalized to each child and support children in becoming creators; and 3) technology should support social interactions. Also, it presents how the theories can be applied to design practice using the examples of littleBits, KIBO, and DigiTile.  Conclusions To design technology that supports children in becoming active users and creators of technology, designers should design carefully based on an understanding of how children learn and develop. The constructivist theories can guide designers through their design process, help in making design decisions, and offer ways to verify designs in order to ensure that the design supports children’s development."

This textbook is a basic and precedence book for introducing the study of literature. Chu focused on the training as a scholar of cautions character. Chu wrote second textbook, Noneohunmonguyi, the same year. This book was designed to explain children the meaning of Analects easily. Chu accounted for Confucius’s cultivation method as ‘study things on the lower level and penetrate things on the higher level(下學上達)’. And, Chu created another textbook, HunmonJeolgu. This book is the collection of 100 quatrain with seven Chinese characters in each line for teaching children Four Classics(四書). This collection of poems is composed of 5 sections as ‘Introduction’, ‘Great Learnings(大學)’, ‘Doctrine of the Means(中庸)’, ‘Analectss(論語)’ and ‘Menciuss(孟子)’. There is the basic philosophy of ‘principle is one but manifested diversely(理一分殊)’ all over the HunmonJeolgu,. So Chu showed that ‘the principle of Heaven is endowed with nature in mind’ and ‘the study and cultivation in everyday life is the method of becoming a sage in the true sense of the word.

Cheongdae, a member of Nam party in Yeungnam had stated his esteemed opinion expressing a tone of flexibility, having been interested in the literary works of two writers, Kim Changhyup of Noron and Imjae, an outsider. At the same time, he followed  the principle of Onyudonhu(溫柔敦厚) by Yi Hwang, a member of the Nam party in Yeungnam, and showed an attitude of avoiding writing novel literature. When it comes to the present conditions of his poetry and prose, 164 chinese poems with 110 titles and 12 proses are included in 『Cheongdae Journal』. It suggests that the Chinese poems are much greater than the prose in number. As for the creation period, many works were done throughout his twenties until  his mid fifties. Among them, only twenty-three Chinese poems and two proses were all included in 『Cheongdae's Collection』, which was published posthumously. That means 121 Chinese poems and 11 proses were omitted in 『Cheongdae's Collection』 but were included in 『Cheongdae Journal』. As part of Cheongdae's valuable literary works, they contained not only his personal monologue but also public records he left while working as a government official.In chapter 3, the paper studied the content and features of the literary works in 『Cheongdae Journal』 focusing on his Chinese poems, classifying them into four areas 'his youth aspirations and academic orientation', 'secret stories , duty as a government official and intellectual’s consciousness for the people’, 'Oryeong(吾嶺) ceremony and sightseeing record' and ‘the imagery of separation and death'. 『Cheongdae Journal』 shows a candid Cheongdae in his youth, who intends to embody respect(敬), justice(義), and as well as a vigorous youth. Wolgwasi(月課詩) was written when he was assigned to Seungmunwon after a successful state examination shows Cheongdae's sensuous poetic talent. In addition, it contains government officials' secret stories(祕話) and the consciousness for the people as a Yeungnam intellectual.Cheongdae as a member of Nam party in Yeungnam also explored the beautiful scenery of Yeungnam including Sangju, Andong, etc. and he expressed its beauty and affection for the Silla Dynasty in a Chinese poem, which reveals that he brought the political posture called 'we Yeongnam(吾嶺)' to his creation of literature. He left a large number of memorial poems(挽詩), which reflect his sense of documentation intending to console the deep sorrow of the people who died of disease and famine and remembering the unknown people.The Cheongdae shown in the literary works of 『Cheongdae Journal』 so far was a man of flexibility and at the same time a man of principle. Though he was excellent in poetry and prose, he was rather interested in the discipline of confucianism. He also tried to establish his own identity as a member of Nam party in Yeungnam and reflect it in his literary works. He was a man with a gentle nature who reflected in depth about humanity and death and could sympathize with pain of others."

Such lack causes fragmentation between content and methods of teaching and also initiates a method-centered approach to teaching without attention to sound and deep understanding of the contents of the text. Another problem in teaching the Bible is the individualized and privatized understanding of Christian faith. Taking these issues into consideration, this paper attempts to propose an alternative approach that can integrate biblical exegesis, theology, and theory of Christian education as well as teach diakonia in terms of the Decalogue for volunteers serving in high-poverty neighborhoods. The Decalogue has been chosen as the theme of Bible teaching in an attempt to transform the privatized personal and ecclesial practices of the current Korean Christians and church, thus calling attention to the importance of diakonia as core practice of the church. Based on literature-based methodology, this paper first gives exegeses on the text of the Decalogue in the book of Exodus 20:1-21 in dialogue with biblical theology. Then this paper aims to relate the theological method and content of Bible teaching in terms of Minjung theology, especially focusing on its concept of “confluences of the two stories.” In addition, Thomas Groome’s “theory of shared praxis” joins in the conversation with biblical theology and Minjung theology. Thus, 1) the exegesis on the text of the Decalogue, 2) Minjung theology’s “confluences of the two stories” for the poor and, 3) dialectical conversation between the Story and our story, in terms of Groome’s “theory of shared praxis” are confluenced when teaching diakonia. This type of teaching that integrates theory and praxis is called “incarnational teaching,” which lies at the focus of this paper. Finally, an example of the teaching-learning plan and questions for group work are proposed for practical use."

The dance originates from Yukdae-Daemu of ancient China. The dancing posture of Munmyo-Ilmu focuses on its spirit rather than on the form of the dance, because it depicts Confucian philosophy. As the dance was composed to reflect such deep meaning and philosophy, we say that it uses ``Saeui``-style (spritual) expression. The posture of the Mun-Mu dance, which celebrates Confucius and his preceding prominent saints, represents virtuousness; and the posture of the Mu-Mu dance, which praises the valiant spirit and righteous fidelity of warriors, symbolizes majesty. As such Munmyo-Ilmu, enlightening virtue, reaches a state that evokes harmony of heaven and earth and, furthermore, expresses a prayer for peace. The extreme significance of unchangeable eternity is expressed and communicated to the audience in the form of this simple dance. The one-movement, one-posture style of the brief dancing mode emphasizes the simple aesthetics of ``Gango`` (simplicity & modesty), so the dance is able to impart its essence freely. Today, aesthetic research of Munmyo-Ilmu`s ``Saeui`` (spiritual) style of expression and the dance`s formal Gango system is a good example of a method to inform emerging opinions in the contemporary art world, through so-called Ongojisin, ``reviewing the old and learning the new.``"

Marginalization of women in developing creative activities using the exclusive property of holding the Chinese men lost their function as a universal language in particular was more severe. When these Sanuidang Kim(1769∼1823) was born in Jeonbuk Namwon and made three fundamental virtues that grew up learning the rules of strict Confucian traditions living in the villages fall from Warrior, effects, light, obedience outlook on life. So are women oppressive social structures continue being a unique person, a hyeonmoyangcheo creative poetry with pride that exists among the faithful at the time independent of the role of women hyobu activities without oysters. As most women so much work over the alleged left a 『samuidang Kim missus posthumous work』 Writings left a vast amount of poetry and convenience sentence of 22 to 99 pieces (total number 253).

Thus was perfected husband is responsible for about a dozen years of hard farm work and livelihood are couples and study in a temple in Seoul are fully consistent with the body of a woman ordinary person for themselves and earn a living while farewell needy. This being so her life or consciousness, and things and poetic perceptions and emotions felt over this, there is a significant difference with other women aristocrat familly. As a woman of villages samuidang Warrior is a story sewn deep set and put in the hearts and overcome the various adverse conditions, sublimation purification was steadily through Chinese poem. Samuidang all the surrounding circumstances or the real one, such as the center of their life has been adopted by topic or material.

She was taking care of her husband devotedly and understand that the best filial piety, only her husband’s rising in the world and gaining fame is offering to parents, samuidang is in and letters sent to her husband for the past ready reiterated that strive only while excluding thoroughly their feelings academic and when the encouraging exhortation form the mainstream.

As a result of this study, three key points were discovered: First, the evaluation score increased with frequent feedback or long discussions. On the other hand, with less feedback, the evaluation score didn`t rise. Second, there were three types of improvement in inquiry related to peer review: No. 1 was improvement after feedback given by themselves. No. 2 was reflection of feedback given to other groups. As a last type, No. 3 was that the students learned from other groups` presentation without any feedback and improved their inquiry. Third, there were five kinds of giving feedback; (1) feedback understanding the inquiry correctly, (2) insufficiency of peer`s inquiry without deep thought. (3) on the usefulness of the inquiry, (4) on the scientific and logic validity through critical thinking, and (5) how to develop the inquiry.

Epoch of Actigraph was set at 1 second, and K4b2were collected breath-by-breath data. Those data were converted to MET values with 60second epoch. Obtained MET values from the criterion measure and Actigrph accelerometer were compared to calculated median, mean, and standard deviations as well as Mean Absolute and Relative Percent Error. Paired t-test was applied to examine the statistical differences of the MET values. To determine the accuracy of the categorization of the physical activity intensity, percent (%) of the correct assignments were calculated. All statistical analysis was calculated by SPSS 20.0 and Stata 12 with α<.05. As a result of the study, overeall Freedson (1998) equation was most accurately estimating MET values comparing to other equations. Troiano (2008) cut-point was precisely classified the intensity of the physical activity among the various cut-points, but not Freedson VM (2011). Advanced technology to estimate physical activity levels should be applied to reduce the error rate of predicting physical activity levels in the near future."

siwonhan-mat: the third taste of korean foods,2016,"['compounded taste', 'gipeun-mat (깊은 맛)', 'kan (간)', 'Korean food', 'siwonhan-mat (시원한 맛)']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Background: Smell and taste are frequently referenced senses when describing flavors of food. In addition to these two senses, Koreans have regarded that there is another sense of taste experienced through the body. This third sense, siwonhan-mat (시원한 맛), describes the sensation of the body including the tongue, stomach, and intestines when eating. While smell and taste play an important role in the enjoyment of food, it is also crucial to evaluate what your body can experience from eating. In this context, siwonhan-mat is the sense acquired through the digestion of food.Methods: This paper will discuss the third taste found in Korean food, siwonhan-mat. In addition, expressions, key elements, and examples of food with siwonhan-mat will be explored.Results: Siwonhan-mat is regarded as a unique taste found in Korean food. Of course, there are other descriptive Korean words for flavor such as kipeun-mat (깊은 맛, deep taste or deeper flavor) and kusuhan-mat (구수한 맛, one of delicate or pleasant taste), but they are similar to the traditional five tastes found in Korean food (saltiness, sourness, sweetness, bitterness, and spiciness) in the sense that they are received through the tongue. By contrast, siwonhan-mat is a refreshing taste experienced by the body during the digestive process. As for umami, part of the modern five basic tastes, it would be practical to subdivide it into a few different compounded tastes, such as kipeun-mat, kokumi, and kusuhan-mat. After conducting many studies about temperature, acidity, and sweetness of foods in order to find a determining factor for siwonhan-mat, researchers have concluded that kan, balancing the salt concentration of food, is closely related to the creation of the siwonhan-mat sensation.Conclusion: Siwonhan-mat is a unique sensation found in Korean food. Understanding siwonhan-mat is a key to learning about Korean food and its food culture. Therefore, this paper serves an important role in understanding Korean food. Siwonhan-mat is often mistranslated using words to describe temperature, such as cool. This misinterpretation has resulted in confusion over the original meaning of siwonhan-mat and contributed to the incorrect usage of the word."

These two for Korean traditional music education should be based on the cultural spirit of Korean traditional music. The original idea should be respected in the Korean traditional music education. However, the final goal of the Korean traditional music education for elementary and secondary school should not be the original idea but the future oriented educative activity toward the creation which is more positive and active than the original idea.The musical transfiguration which had lasted from the 6th century to the late 19th century is one of important Korean musical traditions. It was creative musical transfiguration which had characteristics of respecting the tradition of existing music and making new music based on the tradition. In other words, many pieces of Korean traditional music were based on musical cultural spirit which had made musical transfiguration possible from the existing traditional music and enlarged the number of repertoire through the way of new music making. The creative musical transfiguration was possible because there had been the traditional Korean’s view of music which valued and willingly accepted the musical transfiguration or change as a musical beauty.A deep introspection and rumination by a cognitive attitude on the world of creative musical transfiguration which found in Korean traditional music is needed for a better future-oriented creative elementary and secondary education of Korean traditional music. The meaning and value in the world of creative musical transfiguration should be properly evaluated, educated, continued and inherited to the future generations through elementary and secondary school education without any kind of hesitation or delay. The teaching and learning of Korean traditional music in school should be one of very meaningful, valuable and instructive satisfactory things. The music education of Korean traditional music for elementary and secondary school should aim at the instructive satisfaction which creates bright future and development. A right cognition and attitude on the creative musical figuration found in historical facts which based on tradition will help a lot to the creative future education of Korean traditional music.Achieving the aim of a desirable education of Korean traditional music for elementary and secondary school is not an easy job. It may be more difficult in the future. The difficulty, however, is not the object of shirk or fear but the object of overcome and sublimation. The good result of overcome and sublimation surely will come true if we challenge the difficulty in Korean traditional music education with effect.

Causes of students`` problem behavior is due to remain in the unconscious an imperfect parenting attitude of the parents and main nourisher, the negative childhood experience, dissatisfaction with the need for students. Freud thought that the main cause of mental illness comes from lust, libido that are not met in childhood is to remain in their unconsciousness. Freud is derived ‘free association test’ as a tool to analyze the cause of mental illness. This study provides expansion possibilities ‘free association test’ can be excellent tools to analyze students’ behavior problems. This researcher have attention stage of the story and sympathy that the stage can make it ‘materialization’ the story of the unconscious part of the students. The story that contains the language uplifts the psychological well-being and emotional stability from long ago. Human evolved to bolster the ability to deal with the crisis on virtual reality and they learned the value of its time through story. In addition, this is a powerful force that led to society. So a desire to talk and the inclination of human beings immersed in story easily is woven deep into the structure of the brain. Also, evolution of the brain is inseparable from the development of culture and the emergence of language. The human brain is essentially a social. It evolved linking and coordinating between our brain and other people``s brain. Story has been a social features that can link other people. Cozolino thought permissive and sympathetic human relationships would be reorganizing the structure of the brain again like a stable attachment relationship between childhood parents. Furthermore, it is to integrate right and left hemispheres that came here have been disconnected so far by connecting a bridge. Namely, story is a powerful force that can heal the man. This researcher have attention psychologist, Rogers accomplishing remarkable achievements in theory and practice by ‘nondirective counseling’ to change the paradigm the educational arena. He was invented by human-centered counseling a the principle of ‘directional orientation’ and ‘sympathy’. He was certain that humans can change by sheer strength not a medical treatment but power of client and healer. Rogers’ principle is as follows. Firstly, the therapist can help client is changing its own based on sympathetic relationship between the therapist and client. Second, linked to integration of the brain treatment is facilitated after client becomes to write new positive stories. Namely, sympathy as well as in story, a powerful force that can lead to change the students. This study``s plays are not already a script written to depart from the preliminary text that do not belong with them differentiated with other plays. Students based on the story objectively watching their unconsciousness through up and perpetuating a place to study how to overcome suppression is on stage. Students will just a sustained, in-depth experience in their unconscious in our atmosphere of creative and voluntary and acceptable based on the imagination through improvisational play. Further they can rewrite his stories and express suppression. Freud mentioned that artists with a lot of mental cast of mind can sublimate libido into art, the students can also sublimate and express libido through play. Experience through play can help them reduced negative feelings and maintain a positive relationship with other by balance and integration through reorganizing of their brain. Accordingly, nervous and cheerful stress of forceful play will change the human by integrating brain which is perceived as real through their story. This is going to be at the same time as a dynamic cycle."

Nowadays, design concepts are focused on ‘human-oriented nature’ as a whole and this tendency fits to be appropriate for disaster prevention against real dangers of a future society, which is expected to have far more complicated features. On the other hand, convergences have performed with other areas in the field of Information Communication Technology (ICT) so that we can easily find examples like ‘the strategy of ICT-based convergence’ of the Korean Government in 2014. Modern content designs including UI (user interface) and USN (ubiquitous sensor network) have been developed as one of the representative areas of ICT & UD (universal design) convergences. These days this novel concept of convergence is overcoming the existing limitations of the conventional design concept focused on product and/or service. First of all, from that point our deduced topic or subject would naturally be a monitoring system design of constructional structures in folk villages for safety. We offer an integrated model of maintenance and a management-monitoring scheme. Another important point of view in the research is a safety sign or sign system installed in folk villages or traditional towns and their standardization. We would draw up and submit a plan that aims to upgrade signs and sign systems applied to folk villages in Korea and Japan. According to our investigations, floods in Korea and earthquakes in Japan are the most harmful disasters of folk villages. Therefore, focusing on floods in the area of traditional towns in Korea would be natural. We present a water-level expectation model using deep learning simulation. We also apply this method to the area of ‘Andong Hahoe’ village which has been registered with the World Cultural Heritage of UNESCO.

The study questions the narrowness in underlying understandings of financial education without financial markets, including formal content system of financial education. Thus, this paper offers a novel conceptual understanding of the concept of financial markets system in financial education based on existing academic literature, and suggests how financial markets newly position into the current financial education content. The educational management approaches can be extended into the realms of entire content system in financial literacy education.The argument of this paper is that it can be fruitful to understand financial markets in a dynamic and holistic manner with attention to extended individual and society dimensions in order to fully benefit from financial education and to make financial education a driving force for economic and social development. This paper provides a theoretical model that highlights some of the main factors involved in the relationship between real economy and financial markets. Research suggests that beyond acquiring knowledge and skill to act at real economy, learning on financial markets also involves the development of overall deep understanding about economic decision making. Yet most accounts of financial education do not include this concept.This is one of the first comprehensive studies to explore the importance of financial markets as the essence of the financial literacy education content system, and how the extended concept of financial markets can impact potential of economic development and growth in the modern economy and society. The outcome of this study provides unique insights into the comprehensive concept of financial markets positioned in new financial education system, contribute to theory in the areas of financial education. In addition, this study yields important policy and managerial implications to improve the state of financial education and to employ effective teaching methodologies in the area of financial education."

According to Spinoza, human perfection is nothing less than self-realization, which is guided by reason. man is reached the true knowledge by guidance of reason only. As a result, man becomes free man, which is understanding the law of nature and common notions on things. In other words, man learn how to love themselves and others too. He helps them to understand genuine knowledge by guided reason and love each other in society, that is realized the virtue of community by the conatus. In all, Spinoza""s philosophy helps us to settle the problems of self-centered mind and publicity in our current society. Further more, Spinoza should enable us to discover common humanity as common notion and realize the importance of the others based upon our understanding of each other in a deep and true sense."

Such a dichotomous arrangement can, however, weaken the status of literary texts. It was in the Seventh Curriculum that novels of Park Wan-seo were first published in textbooks. Her works serve to bridge the canon gap, but there are some careless aspects in their selection for textbooks. The present study checked those aspects and confirmed that text selection was a very critical matter.

But in Korea police has centralized system, the activities are very standardized and it occurs inefficiency. Crimes should be treated differently according to the nature of each cities just like men's health care system. In this report I will compare 7 metropolitan city crimes and especially look deep into characteristics of Daejeon's crimes and suggest solution. Also I will suggest the solution to build a crime prevention system in metropolitan community. First, when we compared 7 metropolitan cities all crimes, violent crimes, traffic related crimes, casualty of traffic accidents, crimes occurred in Daejeon were the least. However in the respect of analyzation of all crimes and main 5 crimes in Daejeon, murder, robbery, theft, violence were decreased. But rape was increasing rapidly. Therefore Dajeon should concentrate their police power on sexual crime and pay more attention on prevention instead of arrestment. Take special care on sexual criminals, increase patrols around the household where single women live, usage of big data system are the possible solutions. And for prevention of metropolitan crimes, build a cooperation system between police and citizens, government and citizens, city and private security systems are needed."

Jajang went to Chinese Tang and studied Buddhism for 5 years from AD 638 to 643.  Among Jajang’s acts in Jangan of Tang, what we can first see is that he was respected by Tang’s royal family. It means that Jajang was not just a monk to learn the Buddhism but a diplomat to represent Silla Dynasty. Furthermore, Jajang showed a miracle as the Yul(vinaya) master in Jangan right after entering Tang. It was even before he met Doseon(道宣) at Jongnamsan(終南山). With these, we can see that Jajang’s position as the Yul master was not acquired in Tang but in Silla already. And, from Beobsang(法常)’s respect toward Jajang, it is possible to infer the influence of Seobnonhag(攝論學) and Hwaeom Idea(華嚴思想).  Next, in his acts at Jongnamsan, Jajang stayed for 3 years at a grass cabin located in the east of Wunjesa(雲際寺) and made a miracle as Yul master. As he had a high position and firm dignity as the Yul master, it may be said that he associated with Doseon on the equal footing. In other words, Doseon’s influence on Jajang might be the horizontal communion rather than the vertical teaching.  Jajang’s acts in Tang had deep relation with his works as Daegugtong(大國統) for national Buddhism after returning to Silla. In this respect, the review of Jajang’s acts in Tang can have a sufficient significance in relation with Jajang’s life and Silla Buddhism."

When Korean culture is taught abroad, Korean studies should be based on further research on how to select and use appropriate resources for each different learning environment because of the teaching of Korean culture based on local contents. Therefore, using the Arirang TV programs as resources, this study investigates the responses of foreign learners studying Korean culture overseas on their understanding of Korean cultural contents in detail. As a result, this research demonstrates the beneficial use of the Arirang TV programs as teaching resources for foreign learners who are interested in building a deep understanding of Korean culture. Based on the results, a variety of drama-style resources in English could be more useful, practical, and essential in the teaching and learning of Korean culture overseas.

Deep distrust is widespread among the parents, and that leads them to rely more on private institutions than on public schools for the education of their children. Behind this anomalous phenomenon lies the fact that the level of one's education largely determines one's social status, economic success and the level of cultural life. For this reason, the educational systems in Korea tend to become too formalistic, unable to implement a more holistic ways of educating students which help students to experience maturation in the fullest sense of the word. This of course makes the already serious situation even worse, thereby putting the schools in an even deeper dilemma. Is there any ways of resolving this sorry situation? This study seeks the answer to this question from Calvin's view of school education. What is crucial in Calvin's approach to school education is that it was the church that first started school education basically as the extension of the church education. Thus, the school education consolidated and deepened what the students had learned from their worship, so that they might understand it fully and apply it effectively to their lives. On the other hand, the students were also required to practice both at church and school what they had learned at the school. Here the worship took on a crucial importance as the integrating factor in the students' Christian life. The present study examines the problems in the Korean school education and tries to see what answers we can get for them from the works of Calvin: what was the purpose of Calvin's school education, how did he actually carry it out, and what was the primary results of such educational efforts. We hope that this brief study can be of service in providng a turning point in the educational system of Korea."

He left various sorts of iterary works; among others, Kwon, Jung-myeon created lotsof literary works ike keeping diaries, but they were almost lost, and about only 4 books of iterary collections have been passed to the present. This writing selected the Chinese poetry included in 『Gyeongjidangmicheong cho Sok4』created in 1917, and 『Gyeongjdangji Byeongja』created in 1936 as the objects for analysis. His old-age life and the result of this writing``s thinking about his works with focus on his Chinese poetry are as follows: First, Kwon, Jung-myeon was a retainer of King Gojong, who served as a government official in the late period of Joseon, and spend his old-age life while retiring to hermitage in Gyeryongsan Mountain when the nation fell. His Chinese poetry vividly represents his appearance of spending old-age life while wandering for all his life like QaYuan, longing for his home country, and cherishing the appearance of a lonely loyal subject. Second, Kwon, Jung-myeon strove for his mental, physical cultivation through the learning of Jonsimyangseong(proper cultivation of heaven-sent personality without losing conscience), and led his life of self-consolation(自寬). In addition, he spend his life assimilating himself with nature by pursuing the life free of a disgrace through preservation of his real intentions, and living in seclusion deep in the mountains in an inauspicious time. Third, Kwon, Jung-myeon, who was a Confucian scholar, he had a critical perspective about the social conditions which were changing into a new trend of the West, or Japanese culture. Also, he set up and suggested scientific technique and humanistic spirit as a relation of means and ends while pointing out people``s non-modest behavior although he acknowledged conveniences of modern civilization. Fourth, Kwon, Jung-myeon pursued his own life as a figure having a positive view of life. Transcending everything while regarding the past life as a dream, Kwon, Jung-myeon, who perceived his death intuitively, was devoted to creation of poetry even before he died. Kwon, Jung-myeon, who lived in the turbulent period from the late Joseon period to the period of Japanese occupation, is the figure not known to the world, but he is an authentic author who created poetry until his death. His world of works vividly exposes the diversity in poetic styles, his impressions about the current situation & changes in social conditions, and the inner world Kwon, Jung-myeon``s Chinese poetry is very invaluable in that his works clearly show the agonies and conflicts of ex-government officials during the late Joseon period, who had to live in the period of Japanese occupation. In this context, it is worthwhile to make an approach to Kwon, Jung-myeon``s world of works from a little more diverse aspects even for some periods to come."

The significance of this special feature is, first, that it overcomes the temptation of becoming emotional about the sensitive relationship between Joseon and Japan or self-contradictional derivation of conclusion with various opinions. Second, it can be highly appreciated as a presentation of vision for the future of responsible mass communication that it not only presented the keyword of the error of self absolutization, which Japan had fallen into, to swiftly solved the problems of Japan`s ignoring of Joseon, trying to usurp Joseon`s language, error of Japanese Joseon researchers, and Joseon policy, but also presented the correct findings on people of Joseon through the learning of Joseon language getting out of stereotype Joseon view made by Japanese people with Japanese language. Third, it did not stop at presenting issue of the phenomenons that are caused by the above problems but also presented new vision of the relationship between the two countries through actual examples. Finally, this special feature is not a stationary article stoping at diagnosing the pathology but it is an article moving toward the future by also presenting new prescription. But, on the other hand, it cannot be overlooked that it also exposes many things lacking. Logical arming against deep rooted conventionality and outdated assertions of Japanese writers still rampant today is missing, and the point that only relatively Joseon-friendly or Joseon-supporting Japanese people appeared without the stage of heated discussion for actual verbal battle with them is left as a room and limit that can face criticism of being complacent."

(1) 믿음의 현세적 삶은 영적인 삶에 기초한다. (2) 믿음의 현세적 삶 은‘오직 성경’(sola scriptura)에 기초한다. (3) 믿음의 현세적 삶은 합법적이고 정직한 직업을 통해 유지되고, 이 직업은 개인의 생활만 아니라 또한 하나님의 영광과 이웃의 복지를 위한 것이다. (4) 믿음의 현세적 삶은 평생 지속되는 영 성훈련의 과정이다. 청교도로부터 배우는 21세기 한국교회 영성훈련을 위한 네 가지 시사점들 은 한국교회의 영성의 퇴보로 인한 여러 가지 실패들을 실제적으로 치유할 수 있는 요점들을 가리켜준다. 첫째, Perkins의『잘 사는 법』은 신자의 영적인 삶 과 현세적 삶 사이의 긴밀한 연관성을 일깨워 주어, 성속(聖俗)을 구분하는 이 원론적 생활의 오류의 해독제가 된다. 둘째, Perkins의『잘 사는 법』은 신자의 합법적이고 정직한 직업 선택과 유지를 통해 교회의 사회적, 공적 영역에서의 긍정적 역할을 촉구한다. 개인구원 중심의 신앙과 윤리를 가정과 학교와 사회 의 보다 넓은 공공의 광장으로 이끌어내어 그리스도의 제자로서 세상의 빛과 소금의 역할을 감당케 한다. 셋째, Perkins의『잘 사는 법』은 신자의 현세적 직 업을 통한 믿음의 삶은‘오직 성경’의 원리를 따라 지속적으로 성장하고 성숙 하여‘오직 하나님께 영광이’돌려지는 삶을 살게 한다.","Facing with the danger of secularization based on materialism, Korean Church in the 21st century is struggling for life. Therefore nowadays Korean Church’s interest for spirituality including the new recognition of the identity and mission of Church is very higher than ever. We warmly welcome this interest for spiritual renewal and spiritual training by all Christians including theologians and pastors. From the history of Church and tradition we can get a mirror for reflecting the past of our lives, and at the same time attain a campus directing us to look for the future. So this writer draw lessons for our spirituality from the father of Puritanism, William Perkins, and whose book, How to Live, and that Well, which is well embodied of ‘intellectual piety’, a combination of both scriptural knowledge and deep piety. This writer analyses the book and points out four implications for our spiritual training today. (1) Present life of faith is based on spiritual life. (2) Present life of faith is founded in ‘sola scriptura’. (3) Present life of faith is maintained by lawful and honest callings, and these callings are not only for the life of individual, but also for the well-being of neighbours and eventually for the glory of God. (4) Present life of faith is a lifelong training course for spirituality. Such lessons for spiritual training learned from the puritans are medicines to the maladies of 21st century Korean Church caused by spiritual retrogression and failures. First, Perkins’ book, teaching the intimate relationship between the believer’s spiritual life and temporal life, is an antidote to the error of dualism of holiness and earthliness. Second, Perkins’ book demands Korean church to play a positive role in social and public areas, by choosing and maintaining lawful and honest callings. The book leads an individual centered faith and ethics of Korean Church to a public plaza of family, school, and society, and it causes the Church to live as a light and salt to the world. Third, Perkins’ book teaches the believer to continue to grow and maturate in ‘sola scriptura’ through the earthly callings to the ‘soli deo gloria’."

But for solutions to non-tariff barriers, or Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures(‘SPS’) and Technical Barriers to Trade(‘TBT’), however, the effect of the FTA could be considerably damaged. TheSPS part of the FTA consists of six Articles which include general rules similar to the ones in other FTAs concluded by Korean government. In addition, the FTA provides that the SPS Agreement of WTO shall apply between the Parties, except as otherwise provided for the Chapter of it. Though the target of the FTA is to eliminate trade barriers, domestic implementations of the Agreement possibly bring non-tariff barriers on the other Party.The article seeks for effective use of the FTA to ease the burdens of non-tariff barriers, based on a deep investigation into the SPS cases relating to the state practices by China. Chinese governments have experienced abundant of problems with food supply of harmful and dangerous products manufactured under its sovereignty. Suchcases as ‘melamine milk powder in China,’ ‘pesticide in Chinese buns in Japan,’ and ‘Japanese import restriction against Chinese spinach over tolerance limit’ are the import restriction fully based on scientific risk analysis. They falls into the legitimate measures protecting human life or health in the Parties’ territories. The experiences resulted from harmful product supplies are urging the Chinese government to tighten up the domestic regulations. Such practices of China, meanwhile, result in collateral effects, or the restriction of import from foreign territories.The article investigates, as Chinese non-tariff barrier cases, Korea Pasteurized Milk Case, Korea Kimchi Case, Korea Chicken Soup Case, and Korea Raw Rice Wine Case. The cases has the same dimension, or the SPS measures by China over the Korean products which failed to meet the Chinese standards. The implication is thatthe products have been being sold and bought in Korean market without any question.This implicates that some SPS measures may result in non-tariff barriers when a government applies them leaving the characters of a product and the SPS standards of other sovereignty out of consideration.The article suggests “How to make best use of the FTA” in a legal and political view, based on the thought that correspondence and persuasion in accordance with principles of law or legal norms are the most realistic and effective approaches to ease trade conflicts, and to secure benefits from the trade with China, one of the largestworld economies. It represents specific implementations of the Articles in the FTA upon the principle of transparency, equivalence, international standards, harmonization, technical cooperation, Korea-China Committee on the SPS Measures. The vital importance in SPS measures is whether they are based on scientific evidences. AState’s import restriction to protect human in its territory is a sovereign right recognized by international trade laws, if risks to human are clearly evidenced.Uncertain scientific legitimacy, however, causes concerns about international conflicts, because domestic implementation without scientific evidence can be non-tariff barriers.To prevent SPS measures by the Parties from being a cause of trade disputes, two countries need to share the standards of each other’s, and they also should learn and use the FTA articles at first."

His Virtue Establishment and Deep Learning are evaluated as the pillar of the academia, and the cream of the Confucian scholars. Yongam`s concerning mind of the reality, his scholarly worldview, his criticism different from the Theory of the Civilized and Barbarians, and response theory generally keep abreast with his master Ganjae, and inherit them. Yet, in relation to his master Ganjae`s worldview, Yongam did not hesitate to present counsel and advice, and vowed to consolidate mutual ties among his scholarly colleagues to respond to the times and thoughts. Yongam was deeply concerned about the then problem of the Techniques of the Way being divided. The division of schools and political parties led to the division of the state`s public opinions and the weakening of the state power, eventually to the fall of the state due to external powers. Thus, Yongam asked his master Ganjae to unify thoughts. Yet, he developed his philosophy and reasoning and acquired this learning from 30 years of the studies with his master Ganjae, as well as from self-study, thinking and experience. Such self-acquisition theory of Yongam is based on the guideline under which, prior the Japanese colonial rule of Korea, the division of studies due to arguments about the Mind theory is unified into the reasoning studies so as to resist the imperial invasion and Japanese deprivation of Korea, making it significant. We should take Yongam`s patriotic mentality for overcoming the state`s difficulties as the guideline for our future unification of Korea."

The 3 participants of the study were selected from all 6 child-rearing prisoners in the female prison and face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted twice for each inmate so as to collect the details of their child-rearing experience through their story-telling processes. The researcher’s journal, an interview with a correctional officer in the female prison, and a picture drawn by a female prisoner were included in order to enrich the content of data. Findings are as follows: (1) Child-rearing female prisoners got to experience love in the child-raising process and extend this feeling of love for caring for others. (2) They felt dismayed by the adverse prison situation where appropriate child care such as diverse playing tools or toys and optimal learning stimulus for the child are not plausible — feeling “double punishment” due to the feeling of passing their own penalty to the child in the prison as well as the lack of care for the other child outside the prison. (3) Child-raising prisoners, however, felt and realized that the whole process and experience of staying with their child together inside the prison facility made them a real and true mother who could develop deep feelings of attachment to the child inside and outside of the prison and therefore a strong will to survive under any life circumstances. They realized that a true caring mother is always being together with sincere heart and listening to children with sincere heart. (4) Child-raising female prisoners felt the feelings of thanking and understanding others resulted from the situation only in the plight of limitation of everything for child-care that could have been possible if they had raised the child outside the prison. This study reveals what the experience of being a mother in the prison while raising a child is like and further suggests policy directions for the rehabilitation and education of female prisoners in general so that they could successfully be reintegrated into the society after release."

Though the three forms of performances are in unity because songs, dances, and musics are harmonious, the comprehensive academic study is not conducted so. It is because in the school of the modern times, songs, dances, and musics were taught and learned on the focus of respective majors, though they were taught and learned in a mix of style in the ancient times when they were transferred and received mouse to heart. As a result, in an affirmative aspect the number of majors increase, but on the other hand, the ability decreases gradually, to perform songs, dances, and musics in a mix of style, however they are formed in a deep style. For the purpose of disclosing the contrarieties, this study at first examined reading method of 'gagokbo(歌曲譜, song score)'. Though educators teach and singers songs musics by the score named 'jeongganbo(井間譜), it is insufficient. Teaching and learning can be accomplished by analyzing ""16 jeong 6 daegangbo(十六井六大綱譜)"" stated at ｢the preface｣ of ""Sejosillokakbo(世祖實錄樂譜)"" (King Sejo Chronicles Score)"" In reality, Sejosillokakbo(世祖實錄樂譜) is composed of '16 jeong 6 daegangbo(十六井六大綱譜)'. It is necessary, by analyzing the records and scores appearing at dances (=jeongjae, 呈才), to examine how '16 jeong 6 daegangbo(十六井六大綱譜)' is applied . It is because they are included at song accompaniments expressed by mouses and dance accompaniments expressed by bodies. This study analyzed 'maehwajeomjangdan and janggojangdan(梅花點長 短과 杖鼓長短)' to examine '16 jeong 6 daegangbo(十六井六大綱譜)', and knew that the songs of 'sakdaeyeop(數大葉)' included in 16 jeong 6 daegang(十六井六大綱) and the songs of 'pyeon(編)' included in 10 jeong 6 daehang(十井六大綱)' were applied to 6 daegang(六大綱) the same. Only the number of jeonggan(井間) had difference in 16 jeong(十六井) and 10 jeong(十井), and the songs of 'pyeon(編)' were faster than the songs of sakdaeyeop(數大葉). It means that they express the speed of respective musics. In addition, 16jeong 6daegang(十六井六大綱) is divided into two. 'Gak of the first half(前半刻) =1,2,3 daegang(大綱), and gak of the second half(後半刻)=4,5,6 daegang(大綱). In the course, the form and the content of 'the beat of maehwajeom and the beat of Janggo(梅花點 長短과 杖鼓長短)' were defined as those of 16 jeong and 6 daegang(十六 井六大綱). On the basis of them, this study selected and analyzed objectively two samples, one music 'sakdaeyeop(數大葉)' and one music 'Jangjinju(將進酒)'.

‘환경에 대한 성찰’을 주제로 한 대학 글쓰기교육 사례연구,2016,"['레이첼 카슨', '침묵의 봄', '환경', '글쓰기', '생태교육', 'Rachel Carson', 'Silent Spring', 'Environment', 'Writing', 'Ecological Education']","본 연구는 ‘환경에 대한 성찰’을 주제로 한 대학 글쓰기 수업 사례를 통해 학생들의 생태문제에 대한 인식을 제고하고 사고와 표현능력을 함양하는데 있어 교육적 효과가 있음을 분석하였다. 환경운동의 고전인 레이첼 카슨의『침묵의 봄』을 읽고 자신의 생각을 글로 쓰는 과정에서, 학생들의 관심을 이끌어내고 글의 콘텐츠를 강화할 수 있도록 다양한 텍스트를 어떻게 해석하고 접근했는지를 중심으로 논의를 전개하였다. 본 연구 결과가 환경교육과 글쓰기 교육에 시사하는 함의는 다음과 같다.  첫째, 대학 글쓰기 수업은 관심 주제를 설정하여 독립적인 읽기-쓰기 모듈을 구성하여 운영할 필요가 있다. 텍스트를 읽고 생각을 나누고 글로 써보고 피드백을 받는 과정이 하나의 모듈 속에서 순환되고 반복적으로 진행되는 것이 중요하다. 둘째, 학생들의 사고력과 표현력을 키워주기 위해서는 교육과정을 통해 글쓰기 주제와 관련하여 다양한 텍스트들을 융합시키는 것이다. ‘환경’을 주제로 한 3주 모듈의 경우 이 분야의 고전인 『침묵의 봄』을 통해 저자의 문제의식과 만나고, 해당 주제를 탐색할 수 있도록 시, 만화, 노래, 동영상 자료 등 다양한 텍스트를 접목함으로써 학생들이 생각을 확장해 가도록 자극하였다. 셋째 생태교육이나 환경교육을 기획하고 진행할 때 글쓰기 과정을 포함하는 것이 효과적이라는 점이다. 글쓰기는 숙고와 성찰의 기회를 제공한다는 점에서 학생들이 환경에 대해 보다 심도 있는 문제의식을 갖고 일상에서 실천하는 태도를 이끌어내는데 중요한 기회를 제공한다는 것이다.  본 연구를 통해 학생들이 글을 쓰는 과정에서 생태학적 고민과 환경에 대한 문제의식이 심화되고 있음을 발견할 수 있었다. ‘환경’을 주제로 한 대학 글쓰기교육을 다룬 본 사례연구가 향후 생태교육을 하는데 기초적인 자료로써 활용되고, 또한 글쓰기 수업에서 환경을 주제로 하는 읽기-쓰기 교육모듈을 구성하는데 유용성을 갖길 기대한다. 미래 세대를 위한 교육과정에서 환경과 생태교육은 비중 있게 다루어져야 하는 시대가 되고 있다. 그런 점에서 학생들이 글쓰기를 배우면서 자연스럽게 생태주의에 눈 뜨는 계기를 제공했다는 점에서 ‘환경’을 주제로 한 대학글쓰기 교육은 의미가 있었다.","This research paper analyzed educational effects of the writing education in enhancing students’ consciousness on ecological problems and in cultivating their writing abilities through class case studies, which has a subject of introspection on the environment, showing how they utilized related texts in doing so. During the process of reading Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, a classic book of environmental movement, and writing their thinking, discussions have focused on how students interpret and approach the texts, aiming to derive their interests and to strengthen the contents. The implications of this research on environment education and writing education are as follows.  First, university’s writing class needs to be operated in configuring independent reading and writing module, setting up interesting topics. Circulation and repetition of the procedures of book reading, idea sharing, writing, and a feedback in a module is important. Second, concerning writing topics, throughout the educational process, various texts need be conflated to cultivate students’ thinking and expressing ability. In the three weeks’ module with the topic of “Environment”, students could recognize author’s critical mind through the classic book “Silent Spring”, and were motivated to expand their scope of thinking to search the subject, connected with various texts like poem, cartoons, music, and video clips. Third, including writing process in organizing and executing ecological education and/or environmental education is effective. In terms of offering the chances of introspection and contemplation to students, the writing offers important opportunities in deriving their manners of practice on the environment with their deep critical minds on it.  This research could find students’ ecological concerns and critical minds on the environment are intensified during the process of writing. I hope this case study which is handling university’s writing education, with a subject of “environment”, can be utilized for ecological education as a basic material, and I also expect the effectiveness of this study in reconfiguring the educational module of reading and writing during the class activities which handles environmental topics. The era has been coming when ecological education should be handled importantly during the educational process for future generation. In that point, university’s writing education with a subject of environment is meaningful in making chances that students naturally recognize ecology as they learn the writing."

It is essential for writers to have a will to revise and a habit of revising their writing repeatedly to complete draft and finally make a good piece of writing. With limitations on environment in the current university writing, however, most of correction education provided by instructors ends up with simply one-off instruction, which has a little impact on learning of revision. Learners’s positive attitude toward revision of writing is a prerequisite for repeated revision which should be done in writing. This research has proposed a model of the process of correction education, ‘intuitive evaluation → analytic evaluation → self-evaluation,’ as one of ways to let learners have a habit of revising their writing based on positive motivation for revision, and enhance their self-evaluation ability. The results of the application of the model on leaners are as follows. First, in the first step, the intuitive evaluation, learners were asked to write an impression on their peer’s writing by relying on their ‘intuition.’ Intuition requires concentration, caution and endeavor since it is part of conscious empathic action by getting into deep inside of the target and accord with it. Therefore, the learners were guided to appreciate the peer’s writing and express their thoughts on that by concentrating and sticking with the contents as much as they could. On request of the instructors that leaners should frankly express their opinions on the peer’s depending on not analytic but intuitive thoughts, many leaners expressed many positive views. Second, when it comes to the analytic evaluation, the learners were requested to logically point out the emotional contents done through the intuition evaluation, and lead it to a scientific evaluation. For this process, the instructors suggested items for correction, and had the leaners to find out reasons for their intuitive evaluation on the peer’s within the text and provide its logical basis. The analytic evaluation based on given criteria has helped the subjects carrying out correction to be involved in a detailed evaluation by exploring the text itself more precisely than they do during the intuitive evaluation to discover reasons for the items presented. Third, during the self-evaluation process, the leaners were asked to review their own writing objectively by referring to intuitive appreciation and analytic evaluation of the peers. The learners came to diagnose problems of their writing relatively smoothly because they already practiced correction from expressing their intuitive opinions on the peer’s and applying it to the analytic evaluation. It can be translated that the process of exchanging reactions on the evaluation between peers has helped the learners recognize readers, and internalize the evaluation guide for good writing to a certain extent through learning of correction twice. It can be better to revise writing multiple times since revision is derived from writers’ awareness of readers and the responsibility for own writing. During the correction education, it can be considered that the role of an instructor to make learners have a habit of revising their writing repeatedly is to help them have a positive thought on revision and raise their ability for self-revision. Lastly, it is expected that the self-revision model processed through the intuitive appreciation and analytic evaluation provided by peers proposed on this study can be one way of useful correction education for enhancing university students’ motivation and ability for revision."
중국 위생검역분야 비관세장벽 완화를 위한 한 - 중 fta 이행방안,2016,"['Korea-China FTA', 'Sanitary and Phytosanitary(SPS) Measures', 'Non-tariff Barriers', 'transparency', 'equivalence', 'harmonization', 'SPS Committee.', '한-중 FTA', '위생검역조치', '비관세장벽', '투명성', '동등성', '조화', '위생검역위원회']","한-중 FTA의 타결은 우리나라의 농수산품 관련 산업의 대중국 진출을 위한 전환점이 될 것으로 기대되지만, 위생검역(SPS) 및 기술무역장벽(TBT)으로 대변되는 비관세장벽이 해소되지 않는다면 그 효과는 반감될 것이다. 총 6개의 조문으로 구성된 한-중 FTA 위생검역분야는 우리나라가 체결한 다른 FTA처럼 일반적인 규정과 함께, 한-중 FTA에 달리 규정이 없는 경우에는 WTO SPS 협정을 따르도록 하고 있다. 한-중 FTA의 기본 목적은 무역장벽의 해소이지만, 문제는 국내이행과정에서 비관세장벽의 모습이 나타난다는 점이다.본 논문에서는 중국과 관련한 다양한 위생검역조치 관련 사례들의 분석을 토대로 비관세 장벽의 완화를 위한 한-중 FTA 활용 방안을 모색하였다. 중국은 그동안 유해한 자국제품의 유통으로 인한 문제점을 경험하였다. 중국 내에서 발생한 멜라닌 분유 유통 사례, 중국 농약만두 일본 유통 사례, 허용기준치를 초과한 중국산 시금치에 대한 일본의 수입규제 사례 등에서처럼 과학적 정당성이 입증된 수입규제는 자국민의 생명 및 건강을 보호하기 위한 정당한 법적조치에 해당한다. 중국도 유해한 제품들의 유통으로 인한 인적피해를 겪은 후에는 자국의 관련 법규를 개선·강화하고 있다. 하지만, 중국의 자국 내 위생기준의 강화와 위생검역조치 이행규정의 엄격한 적용으로 인해 타국 제품의 수입을 규제하는 효과가 나타나고 있다. 본 논문에서는 중국의 비관세장벽 운영사례로써 한국산 살균유 수입규제 사례, 한국산 김치수입규제 사례, 한국산 삼계탕 검역규제 사례, 한국산 막걸리 수입 규제 사례를 검토하였다. 이들 사례들은 공통적으로 중국의 위생검역기준에 부합하지 않는 한국산 제품에 대한 검역규제였다. 문제는 이러한 제품들이 한국 내에서는 아무런 문제없이 유통이 이루어지고 있는 제품이라는 점이다. 제품의 특성을 고려하지 않은, 그리고 타국의 위생기준 및 위생검역을 고려하지 않은 위생검역규제들은 비관세무역장벽으로 작동하게 되는 것이다.본 논문에서는 위생검역분야에서 무역강국인 중국과의 통상마찰을 해소하고, 우리의 통상이익을 확보하기 위한 가장 현실적이고 효율적인 수단은 법원칙 또는 법규범에 입각한 대응과 설득이라는 시각에서 한-중 FTA의 활용방안을 법·정책적 측면에서 제시하였다. 한-중 FTA에서 규정하고 있는 투명성 원칙, 동등성, 국제표준 및 조화, 기술협력, 한-중 FTA SPS 위원회 관련 조항들의 구체적인 이행방안을 세부적으로 제시하였다. 위생검역 분야에서 무엇보다 중요한 것은 과학적 정당성에 기반한 정책인가이다. 위해성이 명확하게 입증되는 경우 자국민의 보호를 위한 수입규제 조치는 국제통상규범상 당연한 주권국가의 권리이다. 그러나 과학적 정당성이 불확실한 경우에는 국가별로 상이한 자국의 이행규범을 적용하게 될 때, 이러한 규범은 무역장벽이 되어 국가간 통상분쟁을 야기하게 된다. 한-중 양국이 위생검역분야에서 통상분쟁을 예방하기 위한 일차적인 방법은 양국의 기준에 대한 이해와 공유가 될 것이며, 이를 위한 출발점이 한-중 FTA에 조항에 대한 정확한 이해와 활용이 될 것이다.","The conclusion of Korea-China FTA is considered as a watershed in advancing, especially in the Korea agro-fishery industry to China. But for solutions to non-tariff barriers, or Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures(‘SPS’) and Technical Barriers to Trade(‘TBT’), however, the effect of the FTA could be considerably damaged. The SPS part of the FTA consists of six Articles which include general rules similar to the ones in other FTAs concluded by Korean government. In addition, the FTA provides that the SPS Agreement of WTO shall apply between the Parties, except as otherwise provided for the Chapter of it. Though the target of the FTA is to eliminate trade barriers, domestic implementations of the Agreement possibly bring non-tariff barriers on the other Party.The article seeks for effective use of the FTA to ease the burdens of non-tariff barriers, based on a deep investigation into the SPS cases relating to the state practices by China. Chinese governments have experienced abundant of problems with food supply of harmful and dangerous products manufactured under its sovereignty. Such cases as ‘melamine milk powder in China,’ ‘pesticide in Chinese buns in Japan,’ and ‘Japanese import restriction against Chinese spinach over tolerance limit’ are the import restriction fully based on scientific risk analysis. They falls into the legitimate measures protecting human life or health in the Parties’ territories. The experiences resulted from harmful product supplies are urging the Chinese government to tighten up the domestic regulations. Such practices of China, meanwhile, result in collateral effects, or the restriction of import from foreign territories.The article investigates, as Chinese non-tariff barrier cases,  Korea Pasteurized Milk Case, Korea Kimchi Case, Korea Chicken Soup Case, and Korea Raw Rice Wine Case. The cases has the same dimension, or the SPS measures by China over the Korean products which failed to meet the Chinese standards. The implication is that the products have been being sold and bought in Korean market without any question. This implicates that some SPS measures may result in non-tariff barriers when a government applies them leaving the characters of a product and the SPS standards of other sovereignty out of consideration.The article suggests “How to make best use of the FTA” in a legal and political view, based on the thought that correspondence and persuasion in accordance with principles of law or legal norms are the most realistic and effective approaches to ease trade conflicts, and to secure benefits from the trade with China, one of the largest world economies. It represents specific implementations of the Articles in the FTA upon the principle of transparency, equivalence, international standards, harmonization, technical cooperation, Korea-China Committee on the SPS Measures. The vital importance in SPS measures is whether they are based on scientific evidences. A State’s import restriction to protect human in its territory is a sovereign right recognized by international trade laws, if risks to human are clearly evidenced. Uncertain scientific legitimacy, however, causes concerns about international conflicts, because domestic implementation without scientific evidence can be non-tariff barriers. To prevent SPS measures by the Parties from being a cause of trade disputes, two countries need to share the standards of each other’s, and they also should learn and use the FTA articles at first."

Vertebrate miR-122 is a liver-specific microRNA which is expressed almost solely in hepatocytes and plays an important role in the regulation of hepatocyte function. In this study, to evaluate the potential utility of circulating miR-122 as a biomarker for liver injury in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), fish were orally intubated with two doses of acetaminophen (500 mg/kg or 1.000 mg/kg of body weight), and the expression of miR-122 in serum was quantified using real time-PCR. Histological change in liver, and the enzymatic activity of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) and glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) were also analyzed. The results showed that miR-122 was higher in acetaminophen administered groups compared to control group. The histopathological effect of acetaminophen on olive flounder liver was not distinct. The serum level of GPT and GOT was increased within 2 folds compared to control group by acetaminophen administration. However, the serum miR-122 level was increased more than 3 or 4 folds compared to the control group by administration of 1000 mg/kg of acetaminophen. These results suggest the possible use of miR-122 as an indicator of liver injury in olive flounder, even when histopathological effects are not distinctive."

SR water extract at 500 mg/kg was orally administrated once a day for 4 weeks. Body weights, food and water intakes and urine volumes were measured. The levels of glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) were measured in the sera of rats. Histological changes were observed in pancreas, liver, and kidney tissues by H&E staining. Results: The administration of Sparganii Rhizoma extract at 500 mg/kg in diabetic rats did not shown a significant difference in body weight changes and GPT levels, but showed meaningful changes in an increase of urination volume, and decrease of serum glucose and insulin levels. Total cholesterol and GPT levels were also significantly decreased after SR extract administration in diabetic rats. Furthermore, the abnormal changes of pancreas, liver and kidney were also improved by Sparganii Rhizoma extract administration. Conclusions: These results indicate that SR extract can improve HF/HS-diet and STZ-induced diabetic damages in rats through inhibition of the blood glucose and insulin increase."

To achieve this, 28 ICR mice were grouped into control (CON), resistance exercise training (EX), silkworm pupae powder ingested control (SP), and silkworm powder ingestion with resistance exercise training (SPEX) groups. The change in body weight ratio was significantly decreased in the EX and SPEX groups compared to the CON and SP groups. Total blood protein levels were the highest in SPEX mice compared to those in other groups. The albumin concentration increased only in the EX group. Blood GOT and GPT levels were not significantly affected. Changes in Akt and Gsk-$3{\beta}$ protein expression were not significant but there was a tendency for Akt to increase and for Gsk-$3{\beta}$ to increase following the ingestion of the powder.

(Aconiti Lateralis Radix Preparata: ALRP) as one of cooling and heating medicines on the regulation of body temperature, we investigated the effects of ALRP water extract on hypothyroidism. Methods : Hypothyroidism was induced by intradermal injection with PTU for 4 weeks in SD rats. ALRP extract or L-thyroxine as a control drug was orally administrated for 2 weeks with PTU injection in rats. The physiological and serological parameters were measured in rats. The histological change of thyroid tissues was observed by H&E staining, and also the expression of thermo-regulating proteins was determined by Western blot in dorsal root ganglia and brain tissues of rats. Results : The administration of ALRP extract in PTU-induced hypothyroidism rats was significantly increased body temperature, but did not changes on body weight, food and water intake. ALRP extract did not effect on the levels of TSH and T4 in the hypothyroidism rats. ALRP extract significantly decreased the levels of GPT, glucose, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and total cholesterol in the hypothyroidism rats. In histological observation, the enlarged epithelium and atrophic follicles with higher concentration of follicular cells on hypothyroidism were improved by ALRP extract. In addition, ALRP extract increased the expression of TRPV1 and TRPM8 ion channel proteins in hypothyroidism rats. Conclusion : These results indicate that ALRP extract can improve PTU-induced hypothyroidism through regulation of body temperature and lipid accumulation. The action mechanism of ALRP extract is related with body temperature control by thermoregulation with TRP ion channels."

Dry matter intake showed that the TDN/CP rate of T1 (5.0:1), T2 (4.5:1) and T3 (4.0:1) resulted in similar values. Among feces, the ash content of T1 was 11.07%, which was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than that of T3 (9.69%). It was also significantly (p < 0.05) higher than that of T2 (10.32%). When the TDN/CP rate was increased, the ash content in the feces was also increased. Regardless of the initial weight, weight gain was increased significantly as the CP rate in the feed was increased on the $30^{th}$ day. On the $60^{th}$ day, T2 showed the highest rate of gain (p < 0.05). As the TDN rate was decreased or the protein rate was increased, weight gain was significantly (p < 0.05) increased. Regarding GPT level in the blood after finishing the test, T1 and T3 (112.6, 88.3 u/l) showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher value than T2 (50.9 u/l). For phosphorus level, T1 (46.3 mg/dl) showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher value than other treatments. For HDL cholesterol level, T2 (145.2 mg/dl) had significantly (p < 0.05) higher level than T1 (121.0 mg/dl) or T3 (132.3 mg/dl).

Twenty Hanwoo bulls (653 +/- 22.1) were randomly assigned by body weight (BW) to determine the effects of feeding zilpaterol hydrochloride (Ten bulls with 8.3 mg/kg ZH and ten bulls without ZH) on the ultrasound measurement, carcass traits, and serum compositions. Treatments comprised diets with and without ZH supplemented for 20 days prior to harvest with three days withdrawal period. Treatment of ZH led to an increase either in the final BW or average daily gain (ADG) in Hanwoo bulls (P<0.05). There was no treatment effect on the back fat thickness, ribeye area, and marbling score (P>0.05). ZH treatment tended to increase at dressing percentage (P=0.068). There was a high positive correlation (R-2=0.9226) at treatment but relatively low positive correlation (R-2=0.7156) at control between ultrasound longissimus muscle area and ribeye area. The treatment of ZH affects the serum triglyceride and non esterified fatty acid (P<0.05). Moreover, we demonstrated that the treatment of ZH did not have a negative effect on the serum level of GOT or GPT of Hanwoo bulls. We concluded that the treatment of ZH has little impact on the carcass trait of Hanwoo bulls regardless of the positive effect on BW and ADG. However, dietary ZH increased lipid related serum metabolites of Hanwoo bulls at 14th day.</P>"

Methods The experimental animals were divided into five groups-normal diet-fed (ND), high fat diet-fed control (HFD), HFD＋HDYST 150, HFD＋HDYST 300, and HFD＋orlistat as a positive drug. The obese markers such as body weight, diet efficiency ratio, serum levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, lipid contents, leptin, adiponectin, and GOT/GPT were measured. Also, white adipose tissue, liver weight, abdominal fat mass, hepatic lipid contents, and mRNA expression of obese-associating genes were examined in obese mice. Results In high fat diet-fed mice, HDYST administration significantly decreased body weight, diet efficiency ratio, serum levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-cholesterol, as well as leptin and GOT/GPT, compared to the HFD group in a dose-dependent manner. HDYST increased significantly the serum levels of HDL-cholesterol and adiponectin. It also reduced the accumulation of lipids, such as total lipid and triglycerides, in organs such as liver and abdominal adipose tissue. Moreover, HDYST administration significantly decreased the expression levels of fatty acid synthetic genes, such as sterol regulatory element- binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), FAS and Stearoyl-Coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD-1), in the liver tissues, while it increased the messenger RAN (mRNA) levels of fatty acid catalytic genes, such as Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α), acyl-COA oxidase (ACO), and Carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1a (CPT-1a). Conclusions Based on the results above, HDYST reveals anti-obesity effects declining body fat accumulation through the regulation of fatty acid metabolism and leptin/ adiponectin serum levels. It therefore suggests that HDYST can be clinically useful for the treatment of obesity. (J Korean Med Rehab 2016;26(1):13-31)"

Materials and Methods Hypersecretion of airway mucus was produced by exposure of $SO_2$ to rats for 3 weeks. The effect of orally-administered JGT for 2 weeks on increased epithelial mucosubstances from tracheal goblet cells of rats was assessed by using histopathological analysis after staining the epithelial tissue with Hematoxylin-eosin and PAS-alcian blue. Possible cytotoxicity of JGT was assessed by investigating the potential damage on kidneys and liver functions by measuring serum GOT/GPT activities and serum BUN concentration of rats and the body weight gain during experiment. Also, the effect of JGT on ATP- or PMA- or EGF- or TNF-${\alpha}$-induced MUC5AC mucin production and gene expression from human airway epithelial cells (NCI-H292) were investigated. Confluent NCI-H292 cells were pretreated for 30 min in the presence of JGT and treated with ATP ($200{\mu}M$) or PMA ($10ng/ml$) or EGF ($25ng/ml$) or TNF-${\alpha}$ (0.2 nM) for 24 hrs to assess the effect of JGT both on ATP- or PMA- or EGF- or TNF-${\alpha}$-induced MUC5AC mucin production by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and on gene expression by the same inducers using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results (1) JGT decreased the amount of intraepithelial mucosubstances of trachea of rats. (2) JGT did not show any renal and hepatic toxicities, and did not affect body weights either. (3) JGT significantly inhibited ATP-, PMA-, EGF-, and TNF-${\alpha}$-induced MUC5AC mucin productions from NCI-H292 cells. (4) JGT inhibited EGF-, and PMA-induced expression levels of MUC5AC gene in NCI-H292 cells. However, ATP- and TNF-${\alpha}$-induced MUC5AC gene expression levels were not affected in NCI-H292 cells. Conclusions The result from the present study suggests that JGT might control the production and gene expression of airway mucin observed in various respiratory diseases which accompanied by mucus hypersecretion. Also, JGT did not show liver toxicity or impact on kidney functions. The effect of JGT should be further studied by using animal experimental models which can show proper pathophysiology of airway diseases."
