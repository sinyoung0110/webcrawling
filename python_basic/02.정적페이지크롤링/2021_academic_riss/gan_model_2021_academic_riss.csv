Existing studies limited data to human face data, required a large amount of data, and the synthesized results were not good. In this paper, the following method was introduced to solve the existing problems of existing studies. First, a 3D model with features of the input image was rotated and then rendered as a 2D image to construct a data set. Second, by designing GAN that can learn features of various poses from the data built through the 3D model, the input image can be synthesized at a desired pose.

Photo- based simulacrum has been continuously produced from analog printing or photomontage to digital compositing. The production of the analog simulacrum required sophisticated manual labor and skill, as well as an accurate understanding of the photochemical principle of photography. Since then, with the spread of digital technology, the production of simulacrums has become much easier. By using digital tools, easy and sophisticated operation became possible. With the rapid growth of artificial intelligence algorithms, the production of simulacrum takes another leap forward. GAN is an algorithm that calculates similar data based on learning data, and is a generative model optimized for the production of simulacrum. GAN is opening a new dimension of simulacrum by continuously growing and conquering new tasks. This means that the eyes of artificial intelligence-based machines are once again expanding the human vision."

The technique of completing a 2D puzzle has been studied a lot. However, there is a limitation in that it is difficult to effectively express objects only with 2D. We present a 2D+ Lego puzzle generation algorithm that converts an input image into a 2D Lego puzzle with several bricks that represent heights. We employ a depth map estimation scheme and a semantic segmentation scheme for our purpose. We need to properly process the depth and segmentation information of various objects to apply to the 2D+ puzzle. For this reason, we apply deep learning models to the model to extract a depth map and a segmentation map. To extract the segmentation map, we adopted BiseNet learned with CelebAMask-HQ dataset. And DenseDepth learned with NYU Depth V2 dataset was used to obtain the depth map. We downsample the input image to a low-resolutional image and arrange the color information of the image according to the color palette of the allowable Lego bricks. We build a 2D+ pixel art image by corporating the low-resolutional images with the depth map and segmentation map. 2D+ lego puzzle is constructed from this 2D+ pixel art image by applying a greedy algorithm that seeks a largest Lego brick that can fit the candidate space."
Conditional GAN을 이용한 SAR 표적영상의 해상도 변환,2021,[],,"For successful automatic target recognition(ATR) with synthetic aperture radar(SAR) imagery, SAR target images of the database should have the identical or highly similar resolution with those collected from SAR sensors. However, it is time-consuming or infeasible to construct the multiple databases with different resolutions depending on the operating SAR system. In this paper, an approach for resolution conversion of SAR target images is proposed based on conditional generative adversarial network(cGAN). First, a number of pairs consisting of SAR target images with two different resolutions are obtained via SAR simulation and then used to train the cGAN model. Finally, the model generates the SAR target image whose resolution is converted from the original one. The similarity analysis is performed to validate reliability of the generated images. The cGAN model is further applied to measured MSTAR SAR target images in order to estimate its potential for real application."

Channel current analysis of GaN HEMTs with source sense pin in DC/DC boost converters,2021,"['Gallium nitride (GaN)', 'Channel current', 'Switching loss', 'Analytical model']",,"The breakdown strength and electron mobility of gallium nitride (GaN) are almost ten and three times higher than those of the silicon devices. Wide band-gap devices have a higher thermal conductivity, higher switching frequency capability, lower on-state resistance and lower power dissipation. Detailed analytical models in the electrical network and channel current variations of these devices during switching intervals are still under investigation. The energy loss and heat dissipation on a power converter can be precisely estimated if the operational modes and the corresponding mathematical models of the device are accurately obtained. Depending on the instantaneous values of the channel current and voltage drops on the components computed from the model, the power dissipation and thermal response can be examined. Prediction of the switching losses of a GaN high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) with a source sense pin can be performed using the instantaneous variation of channel current. In this paper, a detailed analytical model including the stray inductances and parasitic capacitors is derived to obtain the channel current of GaN HEMTs with a source sense pin. The turn-on and turn-off transient energy losses during the switching of a single GaN HEMT device can be computed from the analytical model proposed in this paper using the channel current and drain-source voltage. Results of the derived analytical model, SPICE simulations and experimental work on the DC/DC boost converter are compared."

In this study, we propose a method of mitigating and removing shadows using Pix2pix, one of the representative models of GAN, a hostile generating neural network. Since the Pix2pix GAN model requires a pair of images corresponding to training, for this, we propose an idea to create a virtual training image corresponding to it from a normal face image using various image blending methods and use it as a training pair. Results of testing the model trained using the data generated by the proposed method, it can be seen that the shadows of the face image are naturally reduced and that the facial recognition performance is improved."
A Dynamic Control Method for Cavs Platoon Based on the MPC Framework and Safety Potential Field Model,2021,"['Connected and automated vehicles', 'Traffic flow', 'Safety potential field', 'Model predictive control', 'Traffic safety']",,"Safety and efficiency have always been significant challenges to the development of road traffic. Detailed vehicle motion information is the prerequisite for achieving optimal control of the platoon and improving traffic safety and efficiency. The connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) system has offered unprecedented opportunities for the real-time collection and processing of these detailed vehicle motion data. Based on the model predictive control (MPC) framework and safety potential field (SPF) model, we developed an alternative CAVs platoon dynamic control method. The SPF model was applied to describe the road risk distribution under the complex driving environment and was embedded in the MPC framework to optimize the vehicle dynamics from the perspective of capacity, safety, and energy-saving. Also, some experiments were performed to verify the validity of our platoon control strategy. Compared with the fixed time-headway strategy, our proposed strategy can increase the traffic capacity by about 24.4%, while ensuring safety and improving fuel economy. The results indicate that the novel CAVs platoon control methodology proposed in this paper can be potentially applied to alleviate various traffic problems (e.g., traffic congestion, traffic accidents, and high emissions)."

The highest and lowest optical conductivity was obtained at 9 and 8 mTorr pressure respectively. The optical band gap energies of our films have varied non-linearly and this variation in the optical band gap energies have been mainly originated from different Indium compositions in the fi lms.

Currently utilized data in architecture exists in various forms, making it difficult to manage and use the accumulated design information for other reasons. Therefore, this study proposes developing and utilizing technologies that recognize floorplan sketches, one of the analog media, and convert them into digital media, BIM, that computers can understand. (Method) This study is conducted in two parts: 1) floorplan sketch recognition, 2) utilization of recognized floorplan sketches. In the floorplan sketch recognition phase, we propose an approach that applies Generative Adversarial Network-based deep learning techniques to transform human-drawn floorplan sketch styles into one unified form. Specifically, to recognize the floorplan sketches, the deep learning model learns various forms of floorplan sketches and the styles it needs to transform in pairs. The consistent style has essential architectural elements labeled on it : wall, floor, door and window objects. The study uses apartment floorplan images as learning data for floorplan sketch recognition deep-learning model. The apartment floor plan dataset provided by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport Seumteo(e-ais) consists of scanned floorplan images of apartments, houses, and row houses in Seoul. In the phase of the utilization of perceived floorplan sketches, BIM models were generated based on the recognized floorplan sketches. They were subdivided and vectorized by object to extract coordinates, and this enabled BIM models to be obtained by using them as input values for Revit API. (Results) The floorplan sketches labeled with essential architectural elements were the output for the floorplan sketch recognition module, and it was successfully printed out. For the analysis of the study, the predicted image was compared by the ground truth image and showed success. For the second phase, the BIM model prototype made on the Autodesk Revit platform created a fast and accurate 3D BIM model when the recognized floorplan sketches were given input. The created model is low in detail, but it contains the geometry information and the property information, making it an easier way for future use. (Conclusion) This research and development is a sub-development of the overall intelligent design system. It identifies whether computers can recognize one of the design information, floorplan sketches as human beings, and suggests its potentials. Subsequent studies are believed to obtain a BIM model with a high level of detail if recognition is achieved by scaling out of the current recognizable target range."

However, there is still a lot of time is needed for the preventive effect by the vaccine to come out. Therefore, it can be said that the development of an infectious disease treatment that can be used when contracting COVID-19 is a very important issue. However, developing a treatment for COVID-19 requires more time than developing a vaccine. There are many reasons, but among the many drug candidates that can be used in remedy, until a good drug candidate is found that can inhibit or overcome COVID-19, experiments on cell culture and chemical reactions must continue and iteratively, and the results of the chemical reaction must be evaluated. This is because researchers have to check and make judgments one by one. Therefore, in this paper, in order to shorten the clinical trial time required for the development of a remedy agent for the COVID-19, we designed a system that can automatically transform and show the chemical reaction result when a candidate drugs are administered to the COVID-19 virus in a short time and the performance was evaluated. A style transformation model based on StarGAN-v2 designed in this paper supports conversion between multiple styles. In addition, using the automated style transformation model, a candidate drug or compound is directly administered to a specific virus cell and the results can be simulated quickly without waiting for the results of a clinical trial waiting for the results. Therefore, if the style transformation model designed in this paper is used as a simulator for administration results in the clinical trial stage of new drug development, it will be able to contribute to shortening the clinical trial procedure and time"

There is a problem in that preparation for an actual occurrence of algal blooms can be delayed because an alarm is issued by collecting samples directly, and there are also many difficulties in sampling water. In order to solve these problems, research is being actively conducted on the development of technologies that can use IoT technology to monitor the conditions of rivers and lakes through sensors in real time and to warn algal blooms in advance.In this study, the main research object is to solve the data imbalance problem required for the development of an artificial intelligence algorithm to warn the occurrence of algal blooms in advance. In order to solve the overfitting of the artificial intelligence model due to data imbalance in the development of the algal bloom warning model, in this study, various methods for data propagation were tested, and data through the generative adversarial network (GAN), which has been receiving a lot of attention recently, was used. Through this study, it was confirmed that the performance of artificial intelligence models can be improved by data propagation, and this will be helpful in securing accuracy and timeliness in issuing algal blooms in the future."
적대적 생성 신경망을 사용한 유기 행동 검출,2021,"['Abandonment Behavior Detection', 'Ganerative Advesarial Networks', 'Anomaly Detection']",,"Abandoned luggage items in public areas will be a potential threat caused by bombs or biological warfare. We present a method for real-time automatic detection of abandoned luggage in video captured by surveillance cameras. Most works for abandoned objects detection use a preliminary step to detect foreground regions or objects, and use various techniques including deep learning to distinguish between abandoned luggage items and other objects. These object detection-based methods require direct learning of characteristics of different types of objects. However, it is difficult to detect a new type of unlearned object, and there is insufficient detection of the instantaneous situation in which an object is abandoned. In order to solve these problems, we propose reconstruction-based anomaly detection to identify unusual patterns that do not conform to expected behavior such as abandoning objects. The approach is comprised of two stages - first, static object detection based on YOLOv4 and second, abandoned luggage recognition based on anomaly detection using Ganerative Advesarial Networks (GAN). We demonstrate the proposed GAN-based anomaly detection for abandonment behavior by performing experiments on Abnormal Event CCTV Video Dataset."

The author of this study uncovered the creative potential of image generation techniques, specifically a generative adversarial network (GAN), for creating surrealistic artworks in addition to the traditional imaging techniques used in photography and film, such as cameras, projection, and film editing. This study utilizes a mixed research method involving a literature review of surrealistic film and media art, an analysis on GAN techniques, and media art project development. Based on Freidrich Kittler’s analysis method for media studies, this research examines the operational methods of GAN for image generation. The study summarizes the three steps of GAN techniques (data learning, algorithmic statistics, and model application processes) as showing fragmentary, fluidity and combinatory aspects, which relates well with surrealistic expressions. Based on the findings here, the author created an interactive media art project, termed <Viewporter>, and compared a surrealistic AI technique with social phenomena pertaining to city development. <Viewporter> depicts a landscape of a non-existent city and shows this view through a device that resembles a telescope.

Technically, we propose a Pix2Pix model to automatically generate crowns image for damaged teeth, instead of relying on handcrafted drawing. Pix2Pix is remarkable for image-to-image translation applications whose model structure is based on a conditional GAN.

Set of unpaired images (T2-weighted 0.06 T MR image and 1.5 T MR image for separate individuals) were utilized in two clinical trials/sequences. The trials were conducted to identify deformations in a 1.5 T MR image according to the 0.06 T MR image to fit the image and size of the unpaired set. Afterwards, the cyclic-generative adversarial network (GAN) was applied to produce an artificial MR image of the 0.06 T MR image with reference to the original or the deformed 1.5 T MR image. In the end, an improved 0.06 T MR image was produced using the traditional GAN supplemented by the artificial MR image. T2 and flair MR images were verified for matching T1 and T2 testing models in the context of the traditional GAN. The outcomes relating to the optimized trial based on the improved MR image indicated a measurable improvement of the signal with a positive relationship between the original and the improved images. Quantitative variables were applied to assess the quality of the images, along with other settings, such as the signal improvement ratio and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), as well as the variable between the original and the improved MR images. The combination of assessment variables demonstrated that T2 photographs were better in terms of the T1 testing model compared to the T2 testing model."

A coupled model of the zero-dimensional type is extended to incorporate the modelling of the SCR-HP components and the Control Bypass Valve (CBV) block. This model is employed to simulate several scenarios representing the engine operation at both healthy and degraded conditions considering the compressor fouling and the SCR reactor clogging. The derived results are analysed to quantify the impact of the SCR-HP on the investigated engine performance. The SCR system pressure drop and the cylinder bypass valve flow cause an increase of the engine Specific Fuel Oil Consumption (SFOC) in the range 0.3e2.77 g/kWh. The thermal inertia of the SCR-HP is mainly attributed to the SCR reactor, which causes a delayed turbocharger response. These effects are more pronounced at low engine loads. This study supports the better understanding of the operating characteristics of marine two-stroke diesel engines equipped with the SCR-HP and quantification of the impact of the components degradation on the engine performance."

Considering the current degree of development of AI technology, it is thought that the issue of copyright infringement occurring in AI learning stage should be solved more urgently than the issue of copyright infringement occurring in use stage of AI output. Artificial intelligence learning step requires large-scale data input and the use of almost all works as data, making it difficult to solve with conventional fair use law. Accordingly legislative cases in each country, including South Korea, are trying to solve the issue of copyright infringement that may occur in the AI ​​learning stage by placing a new fair use clause or a clause allowing text data mining (TDM). On the other hand, I am of the view that copyright infringement that may occur in the stage of using AI output can be largely resolved by the existing laws of infringement and tort liability. However, even in this area, ""depending on the development of technology,"" there could be marginal cases that are difficult for existing legal principles to solve.Whether an artificial intelligence output has creativity or copyright- ability is a matter that is directly related to whether an artificial intelligence output can infringe on other's copyright. On one side of the view that the copyrightability of artificial intelligence output should be denied, it seems that the current artificial intelligence output can only be used in limited areas such as stock articles, weather articles, and sampling music. Looking at the level of AI(GAN) artwork, chatbot and language translation using NLP, it is necessary to examine in detail whether the AI ​​technology grasps the context from a semantic point of view, and whether creative individuality is expressed accordingly. It is my view that whether pattern recognition, numerical vectorization of characteristics, and probabilistic models adopted by artificial intelligence technology have reached the point where AI can understand human expressions from the viewpoint of semantics not syntactics should be judged legally in the concrete case. An abundance of these discussions will lead to appropriate conclusions on whether to provide legal protection for artificial intelligence output or who to hold legally liable for situations in which artificial intelligence output is believed to infringe on other people's copyrights.This study also discusses the legal nature of open-source license associated with the Edmond de Belamy portrait case. In the AI development process, open source is widely used in the form of open source-based development platforms such as TensorFlow, development tools, and machine learning libraries such as PyTorch. Since AI development requires extensive human and material resources, it is taking an open source community-based development method in which various developers can participate. Regarding the legal treatment of artificial intelligence's achievements and output, it is also necessary to note the legal nature of open-source license applied in the development and distribution process of AI output."
Implantation of Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells into Small Intestinal Submucosa Improves Bile Duct Injury in Rabbits,2021,['Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells Small intestinal submucosa Bile duct injury Epithelial cells'],,"BACKGROUND: Bile duct injury (BDI), which may occur during cholecystectomy procedures and living-donor liver transplantation, leads to life-altering complications and significantly increased mortality and morbidity. Tissue engineering, as an emerging method, has shown great potential to treat BDI. Here, we aimed to explore the application of small intestinal submucosa (SIS) matrix composites with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) to treat BDI in a rabbit model.METHODS: Rabbit-derived BMSCs were used as seed cells. Porcine SIS was used as the support material. Five centimetres of the common bile duct was dissected, and 1/3–1/2 of the anterior wall diameter was transversely incised to construct the rabbit BDI model. Then, SIS materials without/with BMSCs were inserted into the common bile duct of the BDI rabbits. After 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks of implantation, the common bile duct was removed. Haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was used to assess pathological alterations in the common bile duct, while immunohistochemical staining and western blotting were used to detect expression of the epithelial cell markers CK19 and E-cadherin. Scanning electron microscopy was used to evaluate BMSC growth.RESULTS: Compared with BMSCs alone, SIS-attached BMSCs had increased growth. HE staining showed that the injured bile duct healed well and that the complex gradually degraded as the time from implantation increased. Immunohistochemical staining and western blotting showed that compared with the control group, the in vivo complex group had significantly elevated expression levels of CK19 and E-cadherin.CONCLUSION: BMSC implantation into SIS could improve BDI in rabbits, which might have clinical value for BDI treatment."

Deep Learning with Data Augmentation to Add Data Around Classification Boundaries,2021,"['Image Classification', 'Data Augmentation', 'Convolutional Neural Network', 'Generative Adversarial Networks']",,"Data augmentation methods are used as a technique to improve generalization by increasing the number of training data in image classification. However, most of these methods are not a data driven algorithm, the degree of improvement of generalization ability by performing these data augmentation methods differs between the domains of image data for training. Generative models are researched to use for augmenting data recently. In particular, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) that can generate clean image get attention as an excellent innovation in machine learning. As GANs extension method, there is a method called CGANs (Mirza and Osindero, 2014) that can be used for data augmentation. When enough training data for each class are not prepared for classification model, the same is true for training CGANs. In such case, CGAN generates noisy images. This makes a classification model to underfit to the original training data. Moreover, when a CGAN approximates the training data distribution, the CGAN generates new training data in the same region where training data densely exist. In such case, augmented data can’t reduce overfitting on the original training data. Therefore, our research contributes to augment data which meets these two requirements. In this study, we propose a method to generate data by the class specific GAN with small training data and selectively add generated data to the training data set that improves classification accuracy by using the entropy of the classification model. The feature of the proposed method is that it focuses on the positional relationship between data and the classification hyperplane in deep learning. In the proposed method, the entropy of the classification model is used to measure the positional relationship between the classification boundary and the data. As a result, the generalization performance is improved by adding the data around the classification boundary as new training data."

The pivotal role of the NLRC4 inflammasome in neuroinflammation after intracerebral hemorrhage in rats,2021,[],,"The NLRC4 inflammasome, a member of the nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR) family, amplifies inflammation by facilitating the processing of caspase-1, interleukin (IL)–1β, and IL-18. We explored whether NLRC4 knockdown alleviated inflammatory injury following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Furthermore, we investigated whether NLRC4 inflammasome activation can be adjusted by the regulator of G protein signaling 2/leucine-rich repeat kinase-2 pathway. Fifty microliters of arterial blood was drawn and injected into the basal ganglion to simulate the ICH model. NLRC4 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were utilized to knockdown NLRC4. An LRRK2 inhibitor (GNE7915) was injected into the abdominal cavity. Short hairpin (sh) RNA lentiviruses and lentiviruses containing RGS2 were designed and applied to knockdown and promote RGS2 expression. Neurological functions, brain edema, Western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent, hematoxylin and eosin staining, Nissl staining, immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence assay and Evans blue dye extravasation and autofluorescence assay were evaluated. It was shown that the NLRC4 inflammasome was activated following ICH injury. NLRC4 knockdown extenuated neuronal death, damage to the blood-brain barrier, brain edema and neurological deficiency 3 days after ICH. NLRC4 knockdown reduced myeloperoxidase (MPO) cells as well as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β and IL-18 following ICH. GNE7915 reduced pNLRC4 and NLRC4 inflammasome activation. RGS2 suppressed the interaction of LRRK2 and NLRC4 and NLRC4 inflammasome activation by regulating pLRRK2.

Atfirst, CVD experimentswere conducted to synthesize graphene using CH4 as a precursor on a Cu substrate at high temperatures,to get experimental data for training those models. Then, the size, coverage, domain density, and aspectratio of graphene, which vary depending on the synthesis conditions, were measured and analyzedautomatically by developing a region proposal convolutional neural network (R-CNN). Subsequently, anartificial neural network (ANN) and a support vector machine (SVM) were used to develop surrogatemodels to deduce the correlation between CVD process variables and the measured specifications.Characteristic graphene grains with hexagonal morphology were created using a generative adversarialnetwork (GAN) to imitate the CVD growth. Then, they were modified to have the same size and aspectratio as the predicted values and placed to meet the predicted coverage and domain density. Finally, thepre-generated images were modified using Pix2pix to obtain the same outlook as the experimental SEMimages. As a result, it was possible to simulate graphene synthesis under various CVD condition. Throughnumerous simulations in advance, we were able to identify the experiment condition to synthesizegraphene with the desired morphologies of large grain size and low domain density. Developing aplatform to predict a CVD system for the controlled synthesis of graphene allow us to synthesize thegraphene with high efficiency, saving tremendous amounts of time and expenses."

In this study, a solution to this problem is proposed using a deep learning algorithm. First, the EEG signal data are learned using a 2-CH single-electrode sensor in the frontal lobe and an LSTM deep learning model. A data mining algorithm is used to select high-quality data from the measured data. In this process, the data shortage caused by data removal is supplemented by multiplying data using IOU GAN. With the Pearson correlation analysis algorithm, the frequency domain where common features between data occur is identified. From this, the data capacity is reduced and the learning speed is improved. As a result, it was confirmed that behavior identification using EEG is possible with a small number of sensors and the proposed algorithm."

Among them, semantic diffusion used in Indomain GAN, which creates a new image using the synthesis of two images (target and context images), shows excellent performance. However, visual distortion is an issue, which occurs in the generated image depending on the image synthesis ratio.

In addition, there is a deflection problem that focuses on the beginning of the document in mechanical summarization.

계산 이미지의 탄생 - 장치에서 알고리즘으로 -,2021,"['Artificial intelligence', 'Algorithm', 'GAN', 'Technical image', 'Vilem Flusser']",,"This article deals with the changes triggered by artificial intelligence related to image production. The image originally started as a “manual image” drawn by human hands and then differentiated into a “technical image” produced by apparatus in the 19th century. Since then, with the development of image generation algorithms, the automaticity of image production has become more advanced. This generative model, represented by GAN, produces images only by 'calculation' based on probability and statistics. Currently, GAN is receiving the most attention in the field of computer vision, and it excels in various tasks such as creating high-resolution images, translating images, and compositing photos. GAN learns the original photos and creates an image similar to it, which goes beyond the limitations of apparatus such as human hands and cameras. This 'computational image' belongs to the category of 'technical image' in a broad sense, but differs from photography, the first technical image in that there is no indication object. In addition, the automaticity of the program, the nature of the apparatus, is accelerating the exclusion of humans from the image production process in an extreme form. As a result, humans cannot reflect their intentions in image production and are in a position to become a simple consumer of images."
CAB: Classifying Arrhythmias based on Imbalanced Sensor Data,2021,"['Bi-LSTM', 'Data Augmentation', 'ECG', 'GAN', 'Heartbeat Classification', 'E-Health']",,"Intelligently detecting anomalies in health sensor data streams (e.g., Electrocardiogram, ECG) can improve the development of E-health industry. The physiological signals of patients are collected through sensors. Timely diagnosis and treatment save medical resources, promote physical health, and reduce complications. However, it is difficult to automatically classify the ECG data, as the features of ECGs are difficult to extract. And the volume of labeled ECG data is limited, which affects the classification performance. In this paper, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based deep learning framework (called CAB) for heart arrhythmia classification. CAB focuses on improving the detection accuracy based on a small number of labeled samples. It is trained based on the class-imbalance ECG data. Augmenting ECG data by a GAN model eliminates the impact of data scarcity. After data augmentation, CAB classifies the ECG data by using a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (Bi-LSTM). Experiment results show a better performance of CAB compared with state-of-the-art methods. The overall classification accuracy of CAB is 99.71%.

Conditional Generative Adversarial Network(CGAN) 기반 협업 필터링 추천 시스템,2021,"['추천 시스템', '협업 필터링', '오버샘플링', '딥러닝', 'Recommendation System', 'Collaborative filtering', 'Oversampling', 'Deep learning', 'GAN']",,"With the development of information technology, the amount of available information increases daily. However, having access to so much information makes it difficult for users to easily find the information they seek. Users want a visualized system that reduces information retrieval and learning time, saving them from personally reading and judging all available information. As a result, recommendation systems are an increasingly important technologies that are essential to the business.  Collaborative filtering is used in various fields with excellent performance because recommendations are made based on similar user interests and preferences. However, limitations do exist. Sparsity occurs when user-item preference information is insufficient, and is the main limitation of collaborative filtering. The evaluation value of the user item matrix may be distorted by the data depending on the popularity of the product, or there may be new users who have not yet evaluated the value. The lack of historical data to identify consumer preferences is referred to as data sparsity, and various methods have been studied to address these problems. However, most attempts to solve the sparsity problem are not optimal because they can only be applied when additional data such as users personal information, social networks, or characteristics of items are included.  Another problem is that real-world score data are mostly biased to high scores, resulting in severe imbalances. One cause of this imbalance distribution is the purchasing bias, in which only users with high product ratings purchase products, so those with low ratings are less likely to purchase products and thus do not leave negative product reviews. Due to these characteristics, unlike most users actual preferences, reviews by users who purchase products are more likely to be positive. Therefore, the actual rating data is over-learned in many classes with high incidence due to its biased characteristics, distorting the market. Applying collaborative filtering to these imbalanced data leads to poor recommendation performance due to excessive learning of biased classes.  Traditional oversampling techniques to address this problem are likely to cause overfitting because they repeat the same data, which acts as noise in learning, reducing recommendation performance. In addition, pre-processing methods for most existing data imbalance problems are designed and used for binary classes. Binary class imbalance techniques are difficult to apply to multi-class problems because they cannot model multi-class problems, such as objects at cross-class boundaries or objects overlapping multiple classes.  To solve this problem, research has been conducted to convert and apply multi-class problems to binary class problems. However, simplification of multi-class problems can cause potential classification errors when combined with the results of classifiers learned from other sub-problems, resulting in loss of important information about relationships beyond the selected items. Therefore, it is necessary to develop more effective methods to address multi-class imbalance problems.  We propose a collaborative filtering model using CGAN to generate realistic virtual data to populate the empty user-item matrix. Conditional vector y identify distributions for minority classes and generate data reflecting their characteristics. Collaborative filtering then maximizes the performance of the recommendation system via hyperparameter tuning. This process should improve the accuracy of the model by addressing the sparsity problem of collaborative filtering implementations while mitigating data imbalances arising from real data. Our model has superior recommendation performance over existing oversampling techniques and existing real-world data with data sparsity. SMOTE, Borderline SMOTE, SVM-SMOTE, ADASYN, and GAN were used as comparative models and we demonstrate the highest prediction accur"

A Systematic Implementation of Deepfake Multimedia Video Generation and Detection using Deep Learning,2021,[],,"In the following years, technology has progressed in so many ways that it has provided the cyber society with a resource that only computers can excel at, such as the art of counterfeit of media, which was before unavailable. Deepfakes are a term used to describe this kind of deception. The majority of well-documented Deep Fakes are produced using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Models, which are essentially two distinct Machine Learning Models that perform the roles of attack and defence. These models create and identify deepfakes until they reach a point where the morphing no longer detects the deepfakes anymore. Using this algorithm/model, it is possible to discover and create new media that has a similar demographic to the training set, resulting in the development of the ideal Deep Fake media. Because the alterations are carried out utilising advanced characteristics, they cannot be seen with the human eye. However, it is completely feasible to develop an algorithm that can automatically identify this kind of tampering carried out via the internet. This not only enables us to broaden the scope of our search beyond a single media item, but also beyond a large library of mixed media. The more it learns, the better it becomes as artificial intelligence takes over in full force with automation. In order to create better deep fakes, new models are being developed all the time, making it more difficult to distinguish between genuine and morphing material."

However, various directions of the face can be observed rather than the exact frontal image in real situation. The profile (side view) lacks information when comparing with the frontal view image. Therefore, if we can generate the frontal face from other directions, we can obtain more information on the given face.

Throughput and Interference for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing: A Malicious Perspective,2021,"['Cooperative spectrum sensing', 'Byzantine attack', 'Malicious perspective', 'Throughput and interference']",,"Cognitive radio (CR) is a feasible intelligent technology and can be used as an effective solution to spectrum scarcity and underutilization. As the key function of CR, cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) is able to effectively prevent the harmful interference with primary users (PUs) and identify the available spectrum resources by exploiting the spatial diversity of multiple secondary users (SUs). However, the open nature of the cognitive radio networks (CRNs) framework makes CSS face many security threats, such as, the malicious user (MU) launches Byzantine attack to undermine CRNs. For this aim, we make an in-depth analysis of the motive and purpose from the MU’s perspective in the interweave CR system, aiming to provide the future guideline for defense strategies. First, we formulate a dynamic Byzantine attack model by analyzing Byzantine behaviors in the process of CSS. On the basis of this, we further make an investigation on the condition of making the fusion center (FC) blind when the fusion rule is unknown for the MU. Moreover, the throughput and interference to the primary network are taken into consideration to evaluate the impact of Byzantine attack on the interweave CR system, and then analyze the optimal strategy of Byzantine attack when the fusion rule is known. Finally, theoretical proofs and simulation results verify the correctness and effectiveness of analyses about the impact of Byzantine attack strategy on the throughput and interference."

In particular, the muscle development mechanisms and the difference between the fastest and slowest growth rates. Methods: In this study, we used a growth curve model to fit the growth inflection point (IP) of QingYu pigs and compared differences in the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) transcriptome of muscle both at the growth IP and plateau phase (PP). Results: The growth curve of the QingYu pig had a good fit (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.974) relative to a typical S-curve and reached the IP at day 177.96. At the PP, marbling, intramuscular fat, and monounsaturated fatty acids had increased significantly and the percentage of lean muscle and polyunsaturated fatty acids had decreased. A total of 1,199 mRNAs and 62 lncRNAs were differentially expressed at the IP compared with the PP. Additional to gene ontology and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway analyses, these differentially expressed protein coding genes were principally related to muscle growth and lipid metabolism. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the identified differentially expressed lncRNAs, could play roles in muscle growth, fat deposition and regulation of fatty acid composition at the IP and PP."
FD-StackGAN: Face De-occlusion Using Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks,2021,"['Generative adversarial network', 'GAN', 'image restoration', 'image reconstruction', 'occlusions mask removal']",,"It has been widely acknowledged that occlusion impairments adversely distress many face recognition algorithms' performance. Therefore, it is crucial to solving the problem of face image occlusion in face recognition. To solve the image occlusion problem in face recognition, this paper aims to automatically de-occlude the human face majority or discriminative regions to improve face recognition performance. To achieve this, we decompose the generative process into two key stages and employ a separate generative adversarial network (GAN)-based network in both stages. The first stage generates an initial coarse face image without an occlusion mask. The second stage refines the result from the first stage by forcing it closer to real face images or ground truth. To increase the performance and minimize the artifacts in the generated result, a new refine loss (e.g., reconstruction loss, perceptual loss, and adversarial loss) is used to determine all differences between the generated de-occluded face image and ground truth. Furthermore, we build occluded face images and corresponding occlusion-free face images dataset. We trained our model on this new dataset and later tested it on real-world face images. The experiment results (qualitative and quantitative) and the comparative study confirm the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed work in removing challenging occlusion masks with various structures, sizes, shapes, types, and positions."

Anomaly detection in particulate matter sensor using hypothesis pruning generative adversarial network,2021,"['Anomaly detection', 'generative adversarial network', 'multiple hypothesis', 'particulate matter']",,"The World Health Organization provides guidelines for managing the particulate matter (PM) level because a higher PM level represents a threat to human health. To manage the PM level, a procedure for measuring the PM value is first needed. We use a PM sensor that collects the PM level by laser-based light scattering (LLS) method because it is more cost effective than a beta attenuation monitor-based sensor or tapered element oscillating microbalance-based sensor. However, an LLS-based sensor has a higher probability of malfunctioning than the higher cost sensors. In this paper, we regard the overall malfunctioning, including strange value collection or missing collection data as anomalies, and we aim to detect anomalies for the maintenance of PM measuring sensors. We propose a novel architecture for solving the above aim that we call the hypothesis pruning generative adversarial network (HP-GAN). Through comparative experiments, we achieve AUROC and AUPRC values of 0.948 and 0.967, respectively, in the detection of anomalies in LLS-based PM measuring sensors. We conclude that our HP-GAN is a cutting-edge model for anomaly detection."
Efficient Visual Place Recognition by Adaptive CNN Landmark Matching,2021,"['visual place recognition', 'CNN', 'adaptive', 'landmark', 'matching']",,"Visual place recognition (VPR) is a fundamental yet challenging task of mobile robot navigation and localization. The existing VPR methods are usually based on some pairwise similarity of image descriptors, so they are sensitive to visual appearance change and also computationally expensive. This paper proposes a simple yet effective four-step method that achieves adaptive convolutional neural network (CNN) landmark matching for VPR. First, based on the features extracted from existing CNN models, the regions with higher significance scores are selected as landmarks. Then, according to the coordinate positions of potential landmarks, landmark matching is improved by removing mismatched landmark pairs. Finally, considering the significance scores obtained in the first step, robust image retrieval is performed based on adaptive landmark matching, and it gives more weight to the landmark matching pairs with higher significance scores. To verify the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method, evaluations are conducted on standard benchmark datasets. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method reduces the feature representation space of place images by more than 75% with negligible loss in recognition precision. Also, it achieves a fast matching speed in similarity calculation, satisfying the real-time requirement."
