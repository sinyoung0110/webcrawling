Development of a Hybrid Deep-Learning Model for the Human Activity Recognition based on the Wristband Accelerometer Signals,2021,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Human Activity Recognition', 'Smartwatch', 'Accelerometer', 'Machine Learning', 'Activity Classification', 'Feature Extraction', 'Feature Reduction']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This study aims to develop a human activity recognition (HAR) system as a Deep-Learning (DL) classification model, distinguishing various human activities. We solely rely on the signals from a wristband accelerometer worn by a person for the user's convenience. 3-axis sequential acceleration signal data are gathered within a predefined time-window-slice, and they are used as input to the classification system. We are particularly interested in developing a Deep-Learning model that can outperform conventional machine learning classification performance. A total of 13 activities based on the laboratory experiments' data are used for the initial performance comparison. We have improved classification performance using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with an auto-encoder feature reduction and parameter tuning. With various publically available HAR datasets, we could also achieve significant improvement in HAR classification. Our CNN model is also compared against Recurrent-Neural-Network(RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) to demonstrate its superiority. Noticeably, our model could distinguish both general activities and near-identical activities such as sitting down on the chair and floor, with almost perfect classification accuracy."

The objective of this study is to verify the reliability of the proposed method by applying deep learning to improve the applicability of the method. The AHP-based deterministic method comprises eight factors: fines content, soil thickness, porosity, elastic modulus, shear strength, hydraulic conductivity, saturation, and water content. After dividing the testing area into 1 m square grids, eight factors were derived through field and laboratory experiments. The factor of safety was calculated based on the Mohr-Coulomb failure theory. Finally, the input and output values of deep learning were obtained. Bayesian regularization was applied among gradient descents to improve the learning efficiency when applying machine learning. The actual and predicted factors of safety were compared, and they showed excellent reliability in both the training and test phases. This study demonstrates that the AHP-based deterministic method with deep learning is valuable for determining landslide risk areas."
Developing a Deep Learning-based Fault Detection Model for Plastic Injection Molding for Car Parts Companies,2021,"['Deep learning', 'Fault detection', 'Plastic Injection molding', 'Car part company']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"A deep learning-based fault detection model, which can be implemented for plastic injection molding for car parts companies, is presented in this research. Compared to conventional fault detection approaches, it is known that recent deep learning-based fault detection approaches are more useful for real-world problems with a large number of variables. In addition, due to the development of advanced sensors generating types of data in multiple modalities, fault detection prompts the need for multimodal deep learning, which is able to facilitate information from various modalities in an end-to-end learning fashion. The presented deep learning-based model opts for an early fusion scheme in which the low-level feature representations of modalities are combined. A case study involving real-world car parts company data, which are related to a car window side molding process, proves that the presented deep learning-based fault detection model outperforms late fusion methods and conventional fault detection models."

Lung Cancer Diagnosis by Deep Learning-based DNA-derived Bacteriophage Nose Analysis of Exhaled Gas,2021,"['Exhaled Gas', 'Diagnosis', 'Deep Learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"PurposeLung cancer has a high mortality rate, however an early diagnosis can contribute to a favourable prognosis. To date, several Methods have been employed for exhaled gas analysis for lung cancer early detection. Although the Methods are fruitful, reliable tools for lung cancer detection are still obscure. Here, we demonstrate the development of a DNA-derived bacteriophage nose (D2pNose) based on genetically engineered phage to diagnose lung cancer by using deep learning model of exhaled gas.MethodExhaled breath was collected in a controlled way from individuals with lung cancer (n=31) and from healthy subjects (n=31). The D2pNose is an array of phage coated proteins of the M13 bacteriophage generated with 20 types of amino acid. Each 20 type sensors consisted of red-, green-, and blue-colored M13 bacteriophage films. The color change profiles of D2pNose were appeared when various volatile organic compounds are exposed to the same density. In this study, colorimetric dataset of exhaled gas obtained from two groups were randomly shuffled and sequentially divided into training and validation set without any pretreatment steps. Diagnostic performance of dataset was then assessed by using 5-fold cross validation of convolutional neural network model.ResultA total of 62 patients were enrolled between November 2019 and May 2020. The baseline demographic characteristics were generally well balanced between two groups, but mean pack year was skewed to lung cancer patients. The deep learning model was trained with D2pNose colorimetric datasets of exhaled gas derived from two groups and could classify them with an accuracy of 75.15% and a classification success rate of 87.1% for lung cancer based on raw human breathing without any pretreatment.ConclusionThese study Results suggest that the combination of D2pNose analysis of exhaled gas and deep learning could be a reliable method for lung cancer screening without any pretreatment."
Deep Learning-based Classification of Respiratory Sounds and Its Clinical Value,2021,"['Auscultation', 'Respiratory Sound', 'Deep learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"IntroductionAuscultation of respiratory sound is a non-invasive and relatively simple diagnostic method that can be performed anytime, but the information provided is quite useful. Breath sound information markedly improves the accuracy of diagnosis and monitoring of disease status. Despite these advantages, auscultation has a major limitation, subjectivity. Since the interpretation of respiratory sounds requires significant expertise and clinical experience, doctors in training sometimes misidentify respiratory sounds. To overcome such a drawback, we developed an automated classification system of respiratory sounds.Method2840 respiratory sounds were recorded by a digital stethoscope in a real clinical setting. Three pulmonologists classified them and 1918 sounds including normal sounds, crackles, wheezes, rhonchi were selected. We applied deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify the classified database. We developed the predictive model for respiratory sound classifcation combining pretrained image feature extractor of series, respiratory sound, and CNN classifer. To evaluate the accuracy of human auscultation ability and compare it with our predictive model, 70 participants were asked to listen to classified sounds and identify them.ResultDeep learning-based classification model detected abnormal sounds with an accuracy of 86.5% and the AUC of 0.93. It further classifed abnormal lung sounds into crackles, wheezes, or rhonchi with an overall accuracy of 85.7% and a mean AUC of 0.92. Meanwhile, the accuracy of human auscultation was different depending on the group; 60.3% for medical students, 53.4% for interns, 68.8% for residents, and 80.1% for fellows.ConclusionThis respiratory sound classification model using deep learning is expected to complement the limitation of inaccurate auscultation of clinicians and help the rapid diagnosis and appropriate treatment of respiratory diseases. In addition, this model will be useful to meet the current medical demands such as non-face-to-face care due to COVID-19 and telemedicine in hard-to-reach area."
Deep Learning Approach for Visible and NIR Imaging for Wood Classification,2021,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"From the viewpoint of combating illegal logging and examining wood properties, there is a contemporary demand for a wood species identification system. Several nondestructive automatic identification systems have been developed, but there is room for improvement to construct a highly reliable model. We tried to identify the Japanese hardwood species from the microscopic image from database of Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute, Japan, with aid of deep learning. We also propose cognitive spectroscopy that combines near infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) with a deep convolutional neural network approach. We defined “cognitive spectroscopy” as a protocol that extracts features from complex spectroscopic data and presents the best results without human intervention. Overall, 120 samples representing 38 hardwood species were scanned using an NIR-HSI camera. A deep learning prediction model was built based on the principal component (PC) images obtained from the PC scores of hyperspectral images. The results showed that the accuracy of wood species identification based on 6PC (PC1-PC6) images was 90.5%, which was considerably higher than the accuracy of 56.0% obtained with conventional visible images."
Deep Learning Machine Vision System with High Object Recognition Rate using Multiple-Exposure Image Sensing Method,2021,"['Deep learning', 'object recognition', 'machine vision system', 'multiple exposure', 'wide dynamic range']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In this study, we propose a machine vision system with a high object recognition rate. By utilizing a multiple-exposure image sensing technique, the proposed deep learning-based machine vision system can cover a wide light intensity range without further learning processes on the various light intensity range. If the proposed machine vision system fails to recognize object features, the system operates in a multiple-exposure sensing mode and detects the target object that is blocked in the near dark or bright region. Furthermore, shortand long-exposure images from the multiple-exposure sensing mode are synthesized to obtain accurate object feature information. That results in the generation of a wide dynamic range of image information. Even with the object recognition resources for the deep learning process with a light intensity range of only 23 dB, the prototype machine vision system with the multiple-exposure imaging method demonstrated an object recognition performance with a light intensity range of up to 96 dB."

Deep Learning-Based Modulation Detection for NOMA Systems,2021,"['Modulation Detection', 'NOMA', 'Wavelet Denoising', 'Residual Network']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Since the signal with strong power need be demodulated first for successive interference cancellation (SIC) receiver in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems, the base station (BS) need inform the near user terminal (UT), which has allocated higher power, of the far UT’s modulation mode. To avoid unnecessary signaling overhead of control channel, a blind detection algorithm of NOMA signal modulation mode is designed in this paper. Taking the joint constellation density diagrams of NOMA signal as the detection features, the deep residual network is built for classification, so as to detect the modulation mode of NOMA signal. In view of the fact that the joint constellation diagrams are easily polluted by high intensity noise and lose their real distribution pattern, the wavelet denoising method is adopted to improve the quality of constellations. The simulation results represent that the proposed algorithm can achieve satisfactory detection accuracy in NOMA systems. In addition, the factors affecting the recognition performance are also verified and analyzed."
A deep learning-based approach for feeding behavior recognition of weanling pigs,2021,"['Convolutional neural network', 'Deep learning', 'Behavior detection', 'Processing', 'Weanling pig']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Feeding is the most important behavior that represents the health and welfare of weanling pigs. The early detection of feed refusal is crucial for the control of disease in the initial stages and the detection of empty feeders for adding feed in a timely manner. This paper proposes a real-time technique for the detection and recognition of small pigs using a deep-leaning-based method. The proposed model focuses on detecting pigs on a feeder in a feeding position. Conventional methods detect pigs and then classify them into different behavior gestures. In contrast, in the proposed method, these two tasks are combined into a single process to detect only feeding behavior to increase the speed of detection. Considering the significant differences between pig behaviors at different sizes, adaptive adjustments are introduced into a you-only-look-once (YOLO) model, including an angle optimization strategy between the head and body for detecting a head in a feeder. According to experimental results, this method can detect the feeding behavior of pigs and screen non-feeding positions with 95.66%, 94.22%, and 96.56% average precision (AP) at an intersection over union (IoU) threshold of 0.5 for YOLOv3, YOLOv4, and an additional layer and with the proposed activation function, respectively. Drinking behavior was detected with 86.86%, 89.16%, and 86.41% AP at a 0.5 IoU threshold for YOLOv3, YOLOv4, and the proposed activation function, respectively. In terms of detection and classification, the results of our study demonstrate that the proposed method yields higher precision and recall compared to conventional methods."

After a user shoots a motion that mimics hitting an object with hands or feet, their pose is analyzed using motion tracking with deep learning to track hand or foot movement while hitting the object. Hitting position and time are then extracted to generate the object’s moving trajectory using physics optimization and synchronized with the video. The proposed method can create videos for hitting objects with feet, e.g. soccer ball lifting; fists, e.g. tap ball, etc. and is suitable for augmented reality applications to include virtual objects."
POI Recommendation Method Based on Multi-Source Information Fusion Using Deep Learning in Location-Based Social Networks,2021,"['Convolutional Neural Network', 'Emotional Information', 'Geographical Information', 'Latent Factor Modelling', 'Location-Based Social Network', 'Objective Function']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Sign-in point of interest (POI) are extremely sparse in location-based social networks, hindering recommendation systems from capturing users’ deep-level preferences. To solve this problem, we propose a content-aware POI recommendation algorithm based on a convolutional neural network. First, using convolutional neural networks to process comment text information, we model location POI and user latent factors. Subsequently, the objective function is constructed by fusing users’ geographical information and obtaining the emotional category information. In addition, the objective function comprises matrix decomposition and maximisation of the probability objective function. Finally, we solve the objective function efficiently. The prediction rate and F1 value on the Instagram-NewYork dataset are 78.32% and 76.37%, respectively, and those on the Instagram-Chicago dataset are 85.16% and 83.29%, respectively. Comparative experiments show that the proposed method can obtain a higher precision rate than several other newer recommended methods."
Is it possible to forecast KOSPI direction using deep learning methods?,2021,"['deep learning', 'machine learning', 'time-series data', '1D-CNN', 'LSTM']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Deep learning methods have been developed, used in various fields, and they have shown outstanding performances in many cases. Many studies predicted a daily stock return, a classic example of time-series data, using deep learning methods. We also tried to apply deep learning methods to Korea's stock market data. We used Korea's stock market index (KOSPI) and several individual stocks to forecast daily returns and directions. We compared several deep learning models with other machine learning methods, including random forest and XGBoost. In regression, long short term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) models are better than other prediction models. For the classification applications, there is no clear winner. However, even the best deep learning models cannot predict significantly better than the simple base model. We believe that it is challenging to predict daily stock return data even if we use the latest deep learning methods."
Semi-supervised Deep Learning Extraction for Information of Lung Cancer Staging from Unstructured Reports of PET-CT Interpretation,2021,"['Deep Learning', 'Lung Cancer', 'Autoextraction']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"PurposeInformation about lung cancer stage is crucial but requires laborious annotation. We developed a deep learning model for extracting information from PET-CT reports for determining lung cancer stages.MethodsPET-CT reports were acquired from two cohorts of patients with lung cancer who were diagnosed at a tertiary hospital between January 2004 and March 2020. One cohort of 20,466 PET-CT reports was used for training and the validation set, and the other cohort of 4190 PET-CT reports was used for the extra-validation set. A preprocessing model (Lung Cancer Spell Checker) was applied to correct the typos, and pseudo-labeling was used for training the model. The deep learning model was constructed using the Convolutional-Recurrent Neural Network. The performance metrics for the prediction model were accuracy, precision, sensitivity, micro-AUROC, and AUPRC.ResultsFor the extraction of primary lung cancer location, the model showed a micro-AUROC of 0.913 and 0.946 in the validation set and the extra-validation set, respectively. For metastatic lymph nodes, the model showed a sensitivity of 0.827 and a specificity of 0.960. In predicting distant metastasis, the model showed a micro-AUROC of 0.944 and 0.950 in the validation and the extravalidation set, respectively.

Model Inversion Attack: Analysis under Gray-box Scenario on Deep Learning based Face Recognition System,2021,"['Model Inversion Attack', 'Deep Learning', 'Face Recognition System', 'Media Clone']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In a wide range of ML applications, the training data contains privacy-sensitive information that should be kept secure. Training the ML systems by privacy-sensitive data makes the ML model inherent to the data. As the structure of the model has been fine-tuned by training data, the model can be abused for accessing the data by the estimation in a reverse process called model inversion attack (MIA). Although, MIA has been applied to shallow neural network models of recognizers in literature and its threat in privacy violation has been approved, in the case of a deep learning (DL) model, its efficiency was under question. It was due to the complexity of a DL model structure, big number of DL model parameters, the huge size of training data, big number of registered users to a DL model and thereof big number of class labels. This research work first analyses the possibility of MIA on a deep learning model of a recognition system, namely a face recognizer. Second, despite the conventional MIA under the white box scenario of having partial access to the users' non-sensitive information in addition to the model structure, the MIA is implemented on a deep face recognition system by just having the model structure and parameters but not any user information. In this aspect, it is under a semi-white box scenario or in other words a gray-box scenario. The experimental results in targeting five registered users of a CNN-based face recognition system approve the possibility of regeneration of users' face images even for a deep model by MIA under a gray box scenario. Although, for some images the evaluation recognition score is low and the generated images are not easily recognizable, but for some other images the score is high and facial features of the targeted identities are observable. The objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that privacy cyber-attack by MIA on a deep recognition system not only is feasible but also is a serious threat with increasing alert state in the future as there is considerable potential for integration more advanced ML techniques to MIA."
Deep Learning Assisted Differential Cryptanalysis for the Lightweight Cipher SIMON,2021,"['Deep Learning', 'Cryptography', 'Lightweight Cipher', 'Differential Cryptanalysis', 'SIMON']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"SIMON and SPECK are two families of lightweight block ciphers that have excellent performance on hardware and software platforms. At CRYPTO 2019, Gohr first introduces the differential cryptanalysis based deep learning on round-reduced SPECK32/64, and finally reduces the remaining security of 11-round SPECK32/64 to roughly 38 bits. In this paper, we are committed to evaluating the safety of SIMON cipher under the neural differential cryptanalysis. We firstly prove theoretically that SIMON is a non-Markov cipher, which means that the results based on conventional differential cryptanalysis may be inaccurate. Then we train a residual neural network to get the 7-, 8-, 9-round neural distinguishers for SIMON32/64. To prove the effectiveness for our distinguishers, we perform the distinguishing attack and key-recovery attack against 15-round SIMON32/64. The results show that the real ciphertexts can be distinguished from random ciphertexts with a probability close to 1 only by 28.7 chosen-plaintext pairs. For the key-recovery attack, the correct key was recovered with a success rate of 23%, and the data complexity and computation complexity are as low as 28 and 220.1 respectively. All the results are better than the existing literature. Furthermore, we briefly discussed the effect of different residual network structures on the training results of neural distinguishers. It is hoped that our findings will provide some reference for future research."
Multi Label Deep Learning classification approach for False Data Injection Attacks in Smart Grid,2021,"['Deep learning', 'False Data Injection Attack', 'Internet of Things', 'Machine learning', 'Multi-label Classification', 'Power System', 'Smart grid']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The smart grid replaces the traditional power structure with information inventiveness that contributes to a new physical structure. In such a field, malicious information injection can potentially lead to extreme results. Incorrect, FDI attacks will never be identified by typical residual techniques for false data identification. Most of the work on the detection of FDI attacks is based on the linearized power system model DC and does not detect attacks from the AC model. Also, the overwhelming majority of current FDIA recognition approaches focus on FDIA, whilst significant injection location data cannot be achieved. Building on the continuous developments in deep learning, we propose a Deep Learning based Locational Detection technique to continuously recognize the specific areas of FDIA. In the development area solver gap happiness is a False Data Detector (FDD) that incorporates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The FDD is established enough to catch the fake information. As a multi-label classifier, the following CNN is utilized to evaluate the irregularity and cooccurrence dependency of power flow calculations due to the possible attacks. There are no earlier statistical assumptions in the architecture proposed, as they are ""model-free."" It is also ""cost-accommodating"" since it does not alter the current FDD framework and it is only several microseconds on a household computer during the identification procedure. We have shown that ANN-MLP, SVM-RBF, and CNN can conduct locational detection under different noise and attack circumstances through broad experience in IEEE 14, 30, 57, and 118 bus systems. Moreover, the multi-name classification method used successfully improves the precision of the present identification."

For reference, we used a logistic regression (LR) model with nine variables manually selected from the 26 variables. A deep neural network (DNN) model was developed using all 26 variables. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of the models were compared in a randomly split validation group.Results: In comparison with the LR model (AUC, 0.724; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.684 to 0.765), the DNN model (AUC, 0.760; 95% CI, 0.724 to 0.795) demonstrated significantly improved performance with respect to the prediction of ACRN (p < 0.001). At a sensitivity of 90%, the specificity significantly increased with the application of the DNN model (41.0%) in comparison with the LR model (26.5%) (p < 0.001), indicating that the colonoscopy workload required to detect the same number of ACRNs could be reduced by 20%.Conclusions: The application of DNN to big clinical data could significantly improve the prediction of ACRNs in comparison with the LR model, potentially realizing further customization by utilizing large quantities and various types of biomedical information."

However, there are no researches to evaluate the performance of communication libraries for multi-GPU based distributed deep learning in a Docker container environment. In this paper, we propose an efficient communication architecture for multi-GPU based deep learning in a Docker container environment by evaluating the performances of various communication libraries. We compare the performances of the parameter server architecture and the All-reduce architecture, which are typical distributed deep learning architectures. Further, we analyze the performances of two separate multi-GPU resource allocation policies ― allocating a single GPU to each Docker container and allocating multiple GPUs to each Docker container. We also experiment with the scalability of collective communication by increasing the number of GPUs from one to four. Through experiments, we compare OpenMPI and MPICH, which are representative open source MPI libraries, and NCCL, which is NVIDIA’s collective communication library for the multi-GPU setting. In the parameter server architecture, we show that using CUDA-aware OpenMPI with multi-GPU per Docker container environment reduces communication latency by up to 75%. Also, we show that using NCCL in All-reduce architecture reduces communication latency by up to 93% compared to other libraries."

Black Pine Bast Scale Detection using Deep Learning,2021,"['Convolutional neural network', 'Deep learning', 'RetinaNet', 'ResNet101', 'Pest detection model']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Pests play a major role in depletion of the agricultural resources. The pest detection can help to prevent the depletion. Even though there is a huge development in technologies, the current farm management devices and methods do not meet the required level to detect the precise pests in the farms and forests. Moreover, in practice, most of the pest detection methods are conventional in nature and depend on the professional workers. The drawbacks of the conventional methods are high cost, time consuming, knowledge dependency of the professional workers, etc. To overcome these drawbacks, a deep learning based pest detection model has been developed to detect the pest. In our research, the key focus is to detect the black pine bast scale. The pheromone traps are used to lure these pests. In order to capture the pheromone trap images effectively, an image capture set up has been developed. It is helpful in solving the problems such as non-uniform image capturing distance and the reflection caused by the outer vinyl present in the pheromone trap. In this experiment, the smartphone Huawei P30 Pro model is used to capture the images. In order to obtain better result from the captured smartphone images, the images were cropped into image segments. These image segments are given as input for the deep learning models. The pre-trained models used in this experiment are Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN, and RetinaNet. The ResNet50, ResNet101, and ResNext101 are used as the backbone layers. Among these developed model combinations, RetinaNet ResNet101 with a combination of the FPN as the backbone layer attains the highest F1 score of 0.78. Hence, this model can be used for automatic detection of black pine bast scale pests attached to the pheromone traps. Then, an image stitching algorithm is used to merge the image segments. Finally, a smartphone application is developed for Black Pine Bast Scale detection."
Two-stage Deep Learning Model with LSTM-based Autoencoder and CNN for Crop Classification Using Multi-temporal Remote Sensing Images,2021,"['Autoencoder', 'Convolutional neural network', 'Crop classification', 'Long short-term memory', 'Multi-temporal images']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This study proposes a two-stage hybrid classification model for crop classification using multi-temporal remote sensing images; the model combines feature embedding by using an autoencoder (AE) with a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier to fully utilize features including informative temporal and spatial signatures. Long short-term memory (LSTM)-based AE (LAE) is fine-tuned using class label information to extract latent features that contain less noise and useful temporal signatures. The CNN classifier is then applied to effectively account for the spatial characteristics of the extracted latent features. A crop classification experiment with multi-temporal unmanned aerial vehicle images is conducted to illustrate the potential application of the proposed hybrid model. The classification performance of the proposed model is compared with various combinations of conventional deep learning models (CNN, LSTM, and convolutional LSTM) and different inputs (original multi-temporal images and features from stacked AE). From the crop classification experiment, the best classification accuracy was achieved by the proposed model that utilized the latent features by fine-tuned LAE as input for the CNN classifier. The latent features that contain useful temporal signatures and are less noisy could increase the class separability between crops with similar spectral signatures, thereby leading to superior classification accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate the importance of effective feature extraction and the potential of the proposed classification model for crop classification using multi-temporal remote sensing images."
Keypoint-based Deep Learning Approach for Building Footprint Extraction Using Aerial Images,2021,"['Building footprint extraction', 'Keypoint detection', 'Instance segmentation', 'Deep learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Building footprint extraction is an active topic in the domain of remote sensing, since buildings are a fundamental unit of urban areas. Deep convolutional neural networks successfully perform footprint extraction from optical satellite images. However, semantic segmentation produces coarse results in the output, such as blurred and rounded boundaries, which are caused by the use of convolutional layers with large receptive fields and pooling layers. The objective of this study is to generate visually enhanced building objects by directly extracting the vertices of individual buildings by combining instance segmentation and keypoint detection. The target keypoints in building extraction are defined as points of interest based on the local image gradient direction, that is, the vertices of a building polygon. The proposed framework follows a two-stage, top-down approach that is divided into object detection and keypoint estimation. Keypoints between instances are distinguished by merging the rough segmentation masks and the local features of regions of interest. A building polygon is created by grouping the predicted keypoints through a simple geometric method. Our model achieved an F1-score of 0.650 with an mIoU of 62.6 for building footprint extraction using the OpenCitesAI dataset. The results demonstrated that the proposed framework using keypoint estimation exhibited better segmentation performance when compared with Mask R-CNN in terms of both qualitative and quantitative results."

It means that the subjective judgment of the doctor is diagnosed with respiratory diseases rather than the quantitative assessment method. However, the subjective diagnosis method relies on the experience of the doctor and can lead t misdiagnosed results. To address these issues, it is important to derive quantitative indicators based on the analysis of respiratory sound data ad utilize it as an objective aid for the diagnosis of the doctor. In this study, we propose using a Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) model for respiratory sound analysis. This method can reflect hierarchical patterns of respiratory sounds that consist of time and frequency domain and allows doctors to interpret the important feature of respiratory sounds. In addition, we propose a feature extraction method that applies several features of respiratory sound as stacked channels. We conducted experiments on real-world respiratory sound data to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of our method. The experimental results showed that the proposed method outperformed the existing methods for respiratory sound analysis. We believe that the proposed method can contribute to diagnosis in the medical field and various industries where the interpretation of sound data is important."

Accordingly, the elderly at high risk of being in an accident need autonomous-driving vehicles. In order to secure driving safety on the road, several technologies to respond to various obstacles are required in those vehicles. Among them, technology is required to recognize static obstacles, such as poor road conditions, as well as dynamic obstacles, such as vehicles, bicycles, and people, that may be encountered while driving. In this study, we propose a deep neural network algorithm capable of simultaneously detecting these two types of obstacle. For this algorithm, we used 1,418 road images and produced annotation data that marks seven categories of dynamic obstacles and labels images to indicate road damage. As a result of training, dynamic obstacles were detected with an average accuracy of 46.22%, and road surface damage was detected with a mean intersection over union of 74.71%. In addition, the average elapsed time required to process a single image is 89ms, and this algorithm is suitable for personal mobility vehicles that are slower than ordinary vehicles. In the future, it is expected that driving safety with personal mobility vehicles will be improved by utilizing technology that detects road obstacles."

Resource Allocation for Heterogeneous Service in Green Mobile Edge Networks Using Deep Reinforcement Learning,2021,"['Deep reinforcement learning', 'green energy', 'heterogeneous service', 'mobile edge computing', 'power consumption', 'resource allocation']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The requirements for powerful computing capability, high capacity, low latency and low energy consumption of emerging services, pose severe challenges to the fifth-generation (5G) network. As a promising paradigm, mobile edge networks can provide services in proximity to users by deploying computing components and cache at the edge, which can effectively decrease service delay. However, the coexistence of heterogeneous services and the sharing of limited resources lead to the competition between various services for multiple resources. This paper considers two typical heterogeneous services: computing services and content delivery services, in order to properly configure resources, it is crucial to develop an effective offloading and caching strategies. Considering the high energy consumption of 5G base stations, this paper considers the hybrid energy supply model of traditional power grid and green energy. Therefore, it is necessary to design a reasonable association mechanism which can allocate more service load to base stations rich in green energy to improve the utilization of green energy. This paper formed the joint optimization problem of computing offloading, caching and resource allocation for heterogeneous services with the objective of minimizing the on-grid power consumption under the constraints of limited resources and QoS guarantee. Since the joint optimization problem is a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem that is impossible to solve, this paper uses deep reinforcement learning method to learn the optimal strategy through a lot of training. Extensive simulation experiments show that compared with other schemes, the proposed scheme can allocate resources to heterogeneous service according to the green energy distribution which can effectively reduce the traditional energy consumption."
A hidden anti-jamming method based on deep reinforcement learning,2021,"['Environmental Cognition', 'Anti-Intelligent Jamming', 'Deep Reinforcement Learning', 'Hidden Anti-Jamming']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In the field of anti-jamming based on dynamic spectrum, most methods try to improve the ability to avoid jamming and seldom consider whether the jammer would perceive the user's signal. Although these existing methods work in some anti-jamming scenarios, their long-term performance may be depressed when intelligent jammers can learn user's waveform or decision information from user's historical activities. Hence, we proposed a hidden anti-jamming method to address this problem by reducing the jammer's sense probability. In the proposed method, the action correlation between the user and the jammer is used to evaluate the hiding effect of the user's actions. And a deep reinforcement learning framework, including specific action correlation calculation and iteration learning algorithm, is designed to maximize the hiding and communication performance of the user synchronously. The simulation result shows that the algorithm proposed reduces the jammer's sense probability significantly and improves the user's anti-jamming performance slightly compared to the existing algorithms based on jamming avoidance."

In this study, series arcs generated by three-phase pulse-width-modulated and three-phase model-predictive-control inverter loads, operating under various conditions, were detected using a deep-learning algorithm. To detect a series arc fault, the frequency characteristics were analyzed using all the frequency bands of a fast Fourier transform (FFT) result. To use all the frequency bands, a deep neural network (DNN), which is a deep-learning algorithm, was used. DNNs can learn quickly from large amounts of data and model complex nonlinear relationships. The DNN model proposed in this paper was designed to use all the frequency bands, and three cases were tested by changing the current magnitude and switching frequency. The arc current detection accuracy was calculated for three test cases and the obtained results were analyzed in detail based on the percentages of true/false and mean absolute error metrics. The analysis confirmed that the arc current was accurately detected, which validates the suitability of the DNN for series arc detection."

The corpus contains 32 files for male speakers and 32 files for female speakers that represent the characteristics of male vs. female differences. The study analyzed all 64 files using sentiment analysis and tried to discover the differences. It is known that there are roughly three types of approach to sentiment analysis: dictionary-based analysis, machine-learning-based analysis, and deep-learning-based analysis. This study takes the first and third kind of analyses. In the dictionary-based analysis, the researchers calculate the sentiment score (SS), sentiment word ratio (SR), and positive word ratio (PR). In the deep-learning analysis, the researchers take two different sorts of analyses: the GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) and the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).

The purposes of this study was to evaluate image quality and noise of LDCT scan images reconstructed with DLIR and compare with those of images reconstructed with the adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction-Veo at a level of 30% (ASiR-V 30%).Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included 58 patients who underwent LDCT scan for lung cancer screening. Datasets were reconstructed with ASiR-V 30% and DLIR at medium and high levels (DLIR-M and DLIR-H, respectively). The objective image signal and noise, which represented mean attenuation value and standard deviation in Hounsfield units for the lungs, mediastinum, liver, and background air, and subjective image contrast, image noise, and conspicuity of structures were evaluated. The differences between CT scan images subjected to ASiR-V 30%, DLIR-M, and DLIR-H were evaluated.Results: Based on the objective analysis, the image signals did not significantly differ among ASiR-V 30%, DLIR-M, and DLIR-H (p = 0.949, 0.737, 0.366, and 0.358 in the lungs, mediastinum, liver, and background air, respectively). However, the noise was significantly lower in DLIR-M and DLIR-H than in ASiR-V 30% (all p < 0.001). DLIR had higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) than ASiR-V 30% (p = 0.027, < 0.001, and < 0.001 in the SNR of the lungs, mediastinum, and liver, respectively; all p < 0.001 in the CNR).

This approach is built on top of two-stage object detection deep learning algorithm called Faster R-CNN with a major modification of using rotated bounding box. The use of rotated bounding box plays a key role in the future work to overcome several inherent difficulties of fracture segmentation relating to the heterogeneity of uninterested background (i.e., minerals) and the variation in size and shape of fracture. Comparing to the commonly used bounding box (i.e., axis-align bounding box), rotated bounding box shows a greater adaptability to fit with the elongated shape of fracture, such that minimizing the ratio of background within the bounding box. Besides, an additional benefit of rotated bounding box is that it can provide relative information on the orientation and length of fracture without the further segmentation and measurement step. To validate the applicability of the proposed approach, we train and test our approach with a number of CT image sets of fractured granite specimens with highly heterogeneous background and other rocks such as sandstone and shale. The result demonstrates that our approach can lead to the encouraging results on fracture detection with the mean average precision (mAP) up to 0.89 and also outperform the conventional approach in terms of background-to-object ratio within the bounding box."
Evaluation of low-dose lung computed tomography (CT) using deep-learning: A phantom study,2021,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"The aim of this phantom study was to evaluate the image quality of low-dose lung computed tomography (CT) achieved using a deep-learning based image reconstruction method. The chest phantom was scanned with a tube voltage of 100 kV for various CT dose index (CTDIvol) conditions: 0.4 mGy for ultra-low-dose (ULD), 0.6 mGy for low-dose (LD), 2.7 mGy for standard (SD), and 7.1 mGy for large size (LS). The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and noise values in reconstructions produced via filtered back projection (FBP), iterative reconstruction (IR), and deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) were computed for comparison. The quantitative results of both the SNR and noise indicate that the adoption of the DCNN makes the image reconstruction in the ULD setting more stable and robust, achieving a higher image quality when compared with the FBP algorithm in the SD condition. Compared with the conventional FBP and IR, the proposed deep learning-based image reconstruction approach can improve the ULD CT image quality while significantly reducing the patient dose.〈그림 본문참조〉"

Deep learning can contrast the minimal pairs of syntactic data,2021,"['deep learning', 'BERT', 'syntactic judgment', 'minimal pair', 'contrast']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The present work aims to assess the feasibility of using deep learning as a useful tool to investigate syntactic phenomena. To this end, the present study concerns three research questions: (i) whether deep learning can detect syntactically inappropriate constructions, (ii) whether deep learning’s acceptability judgments are accountable, and (iii) whether deep learning’s aspects of acceptability judgments are similar to human judgments. As a proxy for a deep learning language model, this study chooses BERT. The current paper comprises syntactically contrasted pairs of English sentences which come from the three test suites already available. The first one is 196 grammatical -ungrammatical minimal pairs from DeKeyser (2000). The second one is examples in four published syntax textbooks excerpted from Warstadt et al. (2019). The last one is extracted from Sprouse et al. (2013), which collects the examples reported in a theoretical linguistics journal, Linguistic Inquiry. The BERT models, base BERT and large BERT, are assessed by judging acceptability of items in the test suites with an evaluation metric, surprisal, which is used to measure how ‘surprised’ a model is when encountering a word in a sequence of words, i.e., a sentence. The results are analyzed in the two frameworks: directionality and repulsion. The results of directionality reveals that the two versions of BERT are overall competent at distinguishing ungrammatical sentences from grammatical ones. The statistical results of both repulsion and directionality also reveal that the two variants of BERT do not differ significantly. Regarding repulsion, correct judgments and incorrect ones are significantly different. Additionally, the repulsion of the first test suite, which is excerpted from the items for testing learners’ grammaticality judgments, is higher than the other test suites, which are excerpted from the syntax textbooks and published literature. This study compares BERT’s acceptability judgments with magnitude estimation results reported in Sprouse et al. (2013) in order to examine if deep learning’s syntactic knowledge is akin to human knowledge. The error analyses on incorrectly judged items reveal that there are some syntactic constructions that the two BERTs have trouble learning, which indicates that BERT’s acceptability judgments are distributed not randomly."

Becausedeep learning-based models are data-driven, large and labeled biosignal datasets are required. Most individual researchersfind it difficult to collect adequate training data. We suggest that transfer learning can be used to solve this problem and increasethe effectiveness of biosignal analysis. Methods: We applied the weights of a pretrained model to another model thatperformed a different task (i.e., transfer learning). We used 2,648,100 unlabeled 8.2-second-long samples of ECG II data topretrain a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and employed the CAE to classify 12 ECG rhythms within a dataset, which had10,646 10-second-long 12-lead ECGs with 11 rhythm labels. We split the datasets into training and test datasets in an 8:2 ratio.To confirm that transfer learning was effective, we evaluated the performance of the classifier after the proposed transferlearning, random initialization, and two-dimensional transfer learning as the size of the training dataset was reduced. Allexperiments were repeated 10 times using a bootstrapping method. The CAE performance was evaluated by calculating themean squared errors (MSEs) and that of the ECG rhythm classifier by deriving F1-scores. Results: The MSE of the CAE was626.583. The mean F1-scores of the classifiers after bootstrapping of 100%, 50%, and 25% of the training dataset were 0.857,0.843, and 0.835, respectively, when the proposed transfer learning was applied and 0.843, 0.831, and 0.543, respectively, afterrandom initialization was applied.

As the input images contain information regarding the propagation environment between the fixed access points (APs) and measurement locations, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model can be trained to learn the features of the indoor environment and approximate the underlying functions of the Wi-Fi signal propagation. The proposed deep learning-based indoor path loss model can achieve superior performance over 3D ray-tracing methods.

However, despite recent advancements in mobile and embedded platform's hardware, locally training a complex deep neural network is still a non-trivial task given its resource demands. Such capability can be used to exploit new machine learning concepts which include federated learning and distributed learning. In this work we show that the limited dynamic memory budgets on mobile platforms is the main constraint, and propose meMon as a framework for efficiently managing mobile memory resources for deep neural network training. Specifically, meMon is cored on a heuristic objective function that identifies neural network activations that are i) easy-to-recompute, ii) consumes large memory spaces, and iii) with weak dependency, so that they are prioritized to be removed from the memory when memory resources are scarce. meMon is implemented in CUDA and will be provided as open source for the research community. We evaluate meMon via hardware benchmark-based emulations and real implementations on the Samsung Galaxy S10 (Android 10) and NVIDIA Jetson TX2. Our evaluations show that meMon enables local training for five state-of-the-art deep learning models (BERT, ResNet-152, DenseNet-169, Stacked LSTM, DCGAN) by reducing the required memory by more than five-fold and speeds up the training process by two-fold compared to a baseline approach. We also show that meMon successfully adapts to dynamic memory budget variations, suggesting its robustness in real-world use cases."

Data augmentation is one of the best ways to improve deep learning performance. Traditional augmentation techniques that modify image brightness or spatial information are difficult to achieve great results. To overcome this, a generative adversarial network (GAN) technology that generates virtual data to increase deep learning performance has emerged. GAN can create realistic-looking fake images by competitive learning two networks, a generator that creates fakes and a discriminator that determines whether images are real or fake made by the generator. GAN is being used in computer vision, IT solutions, and medical imaging fields. It is essential to secure additional learning data to advance deep learning-based fault diagnosis solutions in the power industry where facilities are strictly maintained more than other industries. In this paper, we propose a method for generating power facility images using GAN and a strategy for improving performance when only used a small amount of data. Finally, we analyze the performance of the augmented image to see if it could be utilized for the deep learning-based diagnosis system or not."

To address the first, our models are evaluated by judging every item in Test Suite I, which comprises learner and native sentences from four sources. The results show that the models predict nativelikeness reasonably well. Next, syntactic well-formedness is examined via Test Suite II, comprising correct–incorrect minimal pairs with two conditions. The results indicate that our models do not satisfactorily detect it. The learners’ results reveal their limited knowledge, suggesting that the models learn the inadequateness of lexical associations as a feature of non-nativelikeness because the learner training data comprises Korean English learner corpora. However, our models’ results also show poor performance. We conclude that deep learning is capable of measuring nativelikeness, and well-formedness and lexical associations are no more than necessary conditions for nativelikeness. This implies the need to consider other factors when defining and assessing nativelikeness."

This is because it is necessary to consider various factors required in the actual environment, such as calculating the cost of reinforcement work. In this paper, we propose the method that detects masonry cracks and measures the length of cracks with digital images. The aim of this study is to implement Deep Learning model for crack detection on masonry structure and to apply the method of crack length measurement additionally."

Deep Learning for Very Short-term Rainfall Forecast,2021,"['deep-learning model', 'very short-term rainfall forecast', 'summer', 'localized heavy rainfall events']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This study evaluates the performance of a deep-learning model developed, namely Deep-learning based Rain Nowcasting and Estimation (DEEPRANE), for very short-term (i.e., 1-6 h) rainfall forecast. The June-September 2020, when had the record-breaking summer rainfalls in South Korea, is tested. Hourly rainfall datasets obtained from 705 in-situ observations are used in the evaluation. Overall, DEEPRANE can adequately predict two rainfall classes-moderate rainfall events (MREs; ≥ 1 mm h<SUP>-1</SUP>) and strong rainfall events (SREs; ≥ 10 mm h<SUP>-1</SUP>) with a critical success index (CSI) higher than approximately 0.6 and 0.4 at the lead time of 1 h, respectively, for all observations. In the early morning hours when the highest rainfall peak appears in the bimodal rainfall cycle, DEEPRANE shows better performance for both MREs and SREs forecasts. In contrast, in the late afternoon-early evening hours when the second-highest rainfall peak is observed, it shows a slightly lower performance due to significant overestimation, especially for long lead times, 4-6 h. Probability of detection (POD) scores for MREs forecast always show higher than the false alarm rate (FAR) for all lead times, suggesting that DEEPRANE-based MREs forecast can be useful even for a long lead time of 6 h. For the SREs, POD becomes smaller than FAR for the lead time longer than 2 h. The DEEPRANE performance is further evaluated to the localized heavy rainfall events (LHREs; ≥ 30 mm h<SUP>-1</SUP>). It shows stable performance, irrespective of five different types of LHREs, suggesting the potential possibility of DEEPRANE-based LHREs forecast. This study will ultimately contribute to professionalizing a deep-learning rainfall forecasting system specialized to Korean summer monsoon period (i.e., Changma) to protect public safety."

Various solutions were sought to prevent such problems, but these accidents constantly occurred at unexpected times and places. This paper proposes a human action recognition method to resolve this problem using images taken from the surveillance and security cameras (or CCTV) at the industrial workplace. Video frames are continuously gathered in real-time from CCTV, which is installed throughout the workplace. Then extracted skeleton data from workers feeds into a deep learning model to predict workers’ action. The goal is to check if the predicted behavior belongs to the predetermined risky class and then determine whether that worker is safe or not. In detail, the OpenPose method was applied to extract 2D skeleton data from human, and object detection and super-resolution were employed to improve the performance by enhancing the visibility of human within image frames. The Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) method is widely used in deep learning when dealing with locational-related information. Therefore, this paper used DGNN model, which used GCN method to predict human action from skeleton data. 3D NTU public datasets were processed in 2D and then trained with 2D DGNN models. The model showed 97.4% accuracy on tests, targeting five risky behaviors. We plan to conduct transfer learning on the pre-trained model with skeleton data obtained by filming selected behaviors with CCTV and then test it in the actual industrial workplace."

With timely estrus detection, cattle are artifi cially fertilized and isolated for safety, which directly aff ects the productivity of livestock farms. Estrus can be successfully detected by identifying the mating posture of cattle. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the identifi cation of cattle mating posture based on video inputs for prompt estrus detection.

These features from different channels are fused by using feature fusion module designed as a layer and placed before dense layers of Efficient NET. The experiments were performed on our own dataset collected from hospitals. We also performed experiments of BreakHis, and ICML datasets to evaluate our model.

An image-based deep learning network technique for structural health monitoring,2021,"['damage detection', 'deep learning', 'structural health monitoring', 'system identification']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"When monitoring the structural integrity of a bridge using data collected through accelerometers, identifying the profile of the load exerted on the bridge from the vehicles passing over it becomes a crucial task. In this study, the speed and location of vehicles on the deck of a bridge is reconfigured using real-time video to implicitly associate the load applied to the bridge with the response from the bridge sensors to develop an image-based deep learning network model. Instead of directly measuring the load that a moving vehicle exerts on the bridge, the intention in the proposed method is to replace the correlation between the movement of vehicles from CCTV images and the corresponding response by the bridge with a neural network model. Given the framework of an input-output-based system identification, CCTV images secured from the bridge and the acceleration measurements from a cantilevered beam are combined during the process of training the neural network model. Since in reality, structural damage cannot be induced in a bridge, the focus of the study is on identifying local changes in parameters by adding mass to a cantilevered beam in the laboratory. The study successfully identified the change in the material parameters in the beam by using the deep-learning neural network model. Also, the method correctly predicted the acceleration response of the beam. The proposed approach can be extended to the structural health monitoring of actual bridges, and its sensitivity to damage can also be improved through optimization of the network training."

Three patient management groups were defined: group 1 (outpatient), group 2 (general ward), and group 3 (intensive care unit [ICU]). Multiple pulmonary and cardiovascular metrics were extracted from the chest CT images using deep learning. Additionally, six laboratory findings indicating inflammation and cellular damage were considered. Differences in CT metrics, laboratory findings, and demographics between the patient management groups were assessed. The potential of these parameters to predict patients’ needs for intensive care (yes/no) was analyzed using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curves. Internal and external validity were assessed using 109 independent chest CT scans.Results: While demographic parameters alone (sex and age) were not sufficient to predict ICU management status, both CT metrics alone (including both pulmonary and cardiovascular metrics; area under the curve [AUC] = 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.79–0.97) and laboratory findings alone (C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, white blood cell count, and albumin; AUC = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.77–0.94) were good classifiers. Excellent performance was achieved by a combination of demographic parameters, CT metrics, and laboratory findings (AUC = 0.91; 95% CI = 0.85–0.98). Application of a model that combined both pulmonary CT metrics and demographic parameters on a dataset from another hospital indicated its external validity (AUC = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.66–0.88).Conclusion: Chest CT of patients with COVID-19 contains valuable information that can be accessed using automated image analysis. These metrics are useful for the prediction of patient management."

The images recorded by a camera mounted on a ship could be used for the awareness of other ships surrounding it. In this study, ship awareness was performed using three procedures: detection, localization, and tracking. Initially, ship detection was performed using the deep learning-based detection model, YOLO (You Only Look Once) v3, based on the camera image. A virtual image dataset was constructed using Unity to overcome the difficulty of obtaining camera images onboard with various sizes of ships, and to improve the detection performance. This was followed by the localization procedure in which the position of the horizon on the image was calculated using the orientation information from the ship. Subsequently, the position of the detected ship in the spatial coordinate system was calculated using the horizon information. Following this, the position, course over ground, and speed over ground of the target ships were tracked in the time domain using the extended Kalman filter. A deep learning model that determines the heading of the ship in the image was proposed to utilize abundant information of cameras, and it was used to set the initial value of the Kalman filter. Finally, the proposed method for the awareness of ships was validated using an actual video captured from a camera installed on an actual ship with various encountering scenarios. The tracking results were compared with actual automatic identification system data obtained from other ships. As a result, the entire detection, localization, and tracking procedures showed good performance, and it was estimated that the proposed method for the awareness of the surroundings of a ship, based on camera images, could be used in the future."

An activation function is applied each time to this tensor passing through a hidden layer and the last layer is the fully connected layer. After the fully connected layer, the output layer, which is the final layer, is predicted by CNN. In this paper, a complete machine learning system is introduced. The training data was taken from a Finite Element (FE) model. The input images are the contour plots of curvature gapped smooth damage index. A free-free beam is used as a case study. In the first step, the FE model of the beam was used to generate data. The collected data were then divided into two parts, i.e. 70% for training and 30% for validation. In the second step, the proposed CNN was trained using training data and then validated using available data. Furthermore, a vibration experiment on steel damaged beam in free-free support condition was carried out in the laboratory to test the method. A total number of 15 accelerometers were set up to measure the mode shapes and calculate the curvature gapped smooth of the damaged beam.

Cerebral hemorrhage detection and localization with medical imaging for cerebrovascular disease diagnosis and treatment using explainable deep learning,2021,['Cerebral hemorrhage prediction · Cerebrovascular disease · Explainable artificial intelligence'],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Cerebral hemorrhages require rapid diagnosis and intensive treatment. This study aimed to detect cerebral hemorrhages and their locations in images using a deep learning model applying explainable deep learning. Normal brain images with no hemorrhages and images with subarachnoid, intraventricular, subdural, epidural, and intraparenchymal hemorrhages according to computed tomography (CT) (n = 200) were analyzed. A ResNet deep learning model, including image processing, was utilized. The visual explanation from a heatmap was made at the hemorrhage location using a gradient-class activation map (Grad-CAM). To evaluate the performance of the deep learning system, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were determined. A hemorrhage prediction system for images of normal brains and brains with subarachnoid, intraventricular, subdural, epidural, and intraparenchymal hemorrhages was built. The Grad-CAM representation indicated the location of the hemorrhages in these images. In the prediction results, accurate predictions of the hemorrhage areas were made and visualizations of the corresponding locations overlapped in the images within (− 4, 1) pixel difference. The evaluation of the system performance showed an accuracy of 0.81 with a sensitivity of 0.67 and specificity of 0.86. These results constitue a proof of concept for the use of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to detect cerebral hemorrhages and visualize their locations in medical images, which will allow rapid diagnosis and treatment."

We aimed to develop and evaluate a deep learning-based algorithm (DLA) that performs the detection and characterization of parameters, including MRI safety, of CIEDs on chest radiograph (CR) in a single step and compare its performance with other related algorithms that were recently developed.Materials and Methods: We developed a DLA (X-ray CIED identification [XCID]) using 9912 CRs of 958 patients with 968 CIEDs comprising 26 model groups from 4 manufacturers obtained between 2014 and 2019 from one hospital. The performance of XCID was tested with an external dataset consisting of 2122 CRs obtained from a different hospital and compared with the performance of two other related algorithms recently reported, including PacemakerID (PID) and Pacemaker identification with neural networks (PPMnn).Results: The overall accuracies of XCID for the manufacturer classification, model group identification, and MRI safety characterization using the internal test dataset were 99.7% (992/995), 97.2% (967/995), and 98.9% (984/995), respectively. These were 95.8% (2033/2122), 85.4% (1813/2122), and 92.2% (1956/2122), respectively, with the external test dataset. In the comparative study, the accuracy for the manufacturer classification was 95.0% (152/160) for XCID and 91.3% for PPMnn (146/160), which was significantly higher than that for PID (80.0%,128/160; p < 0.001 for both). XCID demonstrated a higher accuracy (88.1%; 141/160) than PPMnn (80.0%; 128/160) in identifying model groups (p < 0.001).Conclusion: The remarkable and consistent performance of XCID suggests its applicability for detection, manufacturer and model identification, as well as MRI safety characterization of CIED on CRs. Further studies are warranted to guarantee the safe use of XCID in clinical practice."

Deep Learning-based Analysis on Physical Factors of Bar Warping in Rolling Process,2021,"['Deep learning (심층 학습)', 'Rolling process (압연 공정)', 'Bar warping phenomenon (바 휨 현상)', 'Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The bar warping phenomenon in the rolling process negatively decreases both productivity and product quality in steel manufacturing. However, it is difficult to predict and analyze root causes of bar warping phenomenon with conventional methods such as a finite element method (FEM). Therefore, it has been a chronic problem in the rolling process of steel-making. In this paper, we propose a data-driven method to predict the bar warping phenomenon using a deep learning that takes into account physical factors such as difference in speed of the upper/lower rollers, initial thickness, initial width, and heating time, etc. In addition, LRP (Layer-wise Relevance Propagation), which is one of the explainable AI methods, is applied to numerically compute feature importance among such physical factors. We validated this approach with steel making’s actual rolling process data. As a result, we achieved high predictive performance with about 90% accuracy in predicting the bar warping events. In particular, we identified a new physical factor, width reduction, which turns to be a major effect on the bar warping phenomenon."

During the process of EMI monitoring and damage identification, the operational functionality of the smart interface device is a major concern. In this study, common functional degradations that occurred in the smart interface are diagnosed using a deep learning-based method. Firstly, the effect of functional degradations on the EMI responses is analytically discussed. Secondly, a critical structural joint is selected as the test structure from which EM measurement using the smart interface is conducted. Thirdly, a numerical model corresponding to the experimental model is established and updated to reproduce the measured EMI responses. By using the updated numerical model, the EMI responses of the smart interface under the common functional degradations, such as the shear lag effect, the adhesive debonding, the sensor breakage, and the interface detaching, are simulated; then, the functional degradation-induced EMI changes are characterized. Finally, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based functional assessment method is newly proposed for the smart interface. The CNN can automatically extract and directly learn optimal features from the raw EMI signals without preprocessing. The CNN is trained and tested using the datasets obtained from the updated numerical model.

Deep Learning with Data Augmentation to Add Data Around Classification Boundaries,2021,"['Image Classification', 'Data Augmentation', 'Convolutional Neural Network', 'Generative Adversarial Networks']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Data augmentation methods are used as a technique to improve generalization by increasing the number of training data in image classification. However, most of these methods are not a data driven algorithm, the degree of improvement of generalization ability by performing these data augmentation methods differs between the domains of image data for training. Generative models are researched to use for augmenting data recently. In particular, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) that can generate clean image get attention as an excellent innovation in machine learning. As GANs extension method, there is a method called CGANs (Mirza and Osindero, 2014) that can be used for data augmentation. When enough training data for each class are not prepared for classification model, the same is true for training CGANs. In such case, CGAN generates noisy images. This makes a classification model to underfit to the original training data. Moreover, when a CGAN approximates the training data distribution, the CGAN generates new training data in the same region where training data densely exist. In such case, augmented data can’t reduce overfitting on the original training data. Therefore, our research contributes to augment data which meets these two requirements. In this study, we propose a method to generate data by the class specific GAN with small training data and selectively add generated data to the training data set that improves classification accuracy by using the entropy of the classification model. The feature of the proposed method is that it focuses on the positional relationship between data and the classification hyperplane in deep learning. In the proposed method, the entropy of the classification model is used to measure the positional relationship between the classification boundary and the data. As a result, the generalization performance is improved by adding the data around the classification boundary as new training data."

A database of millions of people with a single reference face image per person, instead of multiple reference face images, is created and saved on the centralized server, which helps to reduce memory load on the centralized server. It is noticed that the recognition accuracy is 100% for smaller size datasets and a little less accuracy for larger size datasets and also, results are compared with present methods to show the superiority of proposed method."

USG has manifested comparable performance to MRI. However, conventional vision-based algorithms exhibited inferior performance because of speckle noises and relatively low resolution. In this study, we developed a novel fully convolutional neural network, denoted as Segmentation Model Adopting pRe-Trained Classification Architecture (SMART-CA), with a novel Integrated on Positive Loss Function (IPFL) to diagnose the RCT precisely. Material and Method From the total 1,400 US images, the number of RCT is 1,280, whereas that of healthy shoulder was 120. The ratio of training-set, validation-set, and test-set was 8:1:1, respectively. To diagnose RCT, we constructed SMART-CA to solve USG-related problems such as noisy environment and sparse areas of RCT. By utilizing the pre-trained architecture, the SMART-CA would be able to diagnose the exact location of the RCT despite the low resolution and noises of USG. In addition, the proposed IPLF focused on the positive (disease) area. Results The ablation studies demonstrated that the SMART-CA achieved the improved Precision, Recall, and Dice Coefficient of the 0.640%, 0.971%, and 0.771%, respectively, which were at least 44.3%, 15.2%, and 4.1% higher than those of other deep learning-based state-of-the-art networks. In addition, the experiments of explain-ability of the convolutional networks demonstrated that the pre-trained architecture generates the RCT-related feature-maps. Conclusions The experimental results demonstrated that the suggested ILF outperformed than other conventional loss functions, and the proposed SMART-CA improved the diagnostic performance of RCT."

By definition, a phishing attack happens when malicious people pose as trusted entities to fraudulently obtain user data. Phishing is classified as a type of social engineering attack. For a phishing attack to happen, a victim must be convinced to open an email or a direct message [1]. The email or direct message will contain a link that the victim will be required to click on. The aim of the attack is usually to install malicious software or to freeze a system. In other instances, the attackers will threaten to reveal sensitive information obtained from the victim. Phishing attacks can have devastating effects on the victim. Sensitive and confidential information can find its way into the hands of malicious people. Another devastating effect of phishing attacks is identity theft [1]. Attackers may impersonate the victim to make unauthorized purchases. Victims also complain of loss of funds when attackers access their credit card information. The proposed method has two major subsystems: (1) Data collection: different websites have been collected as a big data corresponding to normal and phishing dataset, and (2) distributed detection system: different artificial algorithms are used: a neural network algorithm and machine learning. The Amazon cloud was used for running the cluster with different cores of machines. The experiment results of the proposed system achieved very good accuracy and detection rate as well."

A total of 102 hand radiographs (51 male and 51 female; mean age ± standard deviation = 10.95 ± 2.37 years) from a single institution were selected for external validation. Three human experts performed bone age assessments based on the GP atlas to develop a reference standard. Two study radiologists performed bone age assessments with and without AI model assistance in two separate sessions, for which the reading time was recorded. The performance of the AI software was assessed by comparing the mean absolute difference between the AI-calculated bone age and the reference standard. The reading time was compared between reading with and without AI using a paired t test. Furthermore, the reliability between the two study radiologists’ bone age assessments was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), and the results were compared between reading with and without AI.Results: The bone ages assessed by the experts and the AI model were not significantly different (11.39 ± 2.74 years and 11.35 ± 2.76 years, respectively, p = 0.31). The mean absolute difference was 0.39 years (95% confidence interval, 0.33– 0.45 years) between the automated AI assessment and the reference standard. The mean reading time of the two study radiologists was reduced from 54.29 to 35.37 seconds with AI model assistance (p < 0.001). The ICC of the two study radiologists slightly increased with AI model assistance (from 0.945 to 0.990).Conclusion: The proposed AI model was accurate for assessing bone age.

The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the model is 5.89%, indicating that the predictive result obtains a very high accuracy, close to 95%. The optimal model is thus applied in combination with ATSP to address the optimal solution for a certain route."
Diagnostic Performance of Deep Learning-Based Lesion Detection Algorithm in CT for Detecting Hepatic Metastasis from Colorectal Cancer,2021,"['Artificial intelligence', 'Colorectal neoplasms', 'Neoplasm metastasis', 'X-ray computed tomography', 'Computer-assisted diagnosis']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Objective: To compare the performance of the deep learning-based lesion detection algorithm (DLLD) in detecting liver metastasis with that of radiologists.Materials and Methods: This clinical retrospective study used 4386-slice computed tomography (CT) images and labels from a training cohort (502 patients with colorectal cancer [CRC] from November 2005 to December 2010) to train the DLLD for detecting liver metastasis, and used CT images of a validation cohort (40 patients with 99 liver metastatic lesions and 45 patients without liver metastasis from January 2011 to December 2011) for comparing the performance of the DLLD with that of readers (three abdominal radiologists and three radiology residents). For per-lesion binary classification, the sensitivity and false positives per patient were measured.Results: A total of 85 patients with CRC were included in the validation cohort. In the comparison based on per-lesion binary classification, the sensitivity of DLLD (81.82%, [81/99]) was comparable to that of abdominal radiologists (80.81%, p = 0.80) and radiology residents (79.46%, p = 0.57). However, the false positives per patient with DLLD (1.330) was higher than that of abdominal radiologists (0.357, p < 0.001) and radiology residents (0.667, p < 0.001).Conclusion: DLLD showed a sensitivity comparable to that of radiologists when detecting liver metastasis in patients initially diagnosed with CRC. However, the false positives of DLLD were higher than those of radiologists. Therefore, DLLD could serve as an assistant tool for detecting liver metastasis instead of a standalone diagnostic tool."
작업 자세 평가를 위한 Vector-based 및 Deep Learning-based OWAS 평가 시스템 개발,2021,"['OWAS', 'Musculoskeletal disorders', 'Ergonomic risk assessment', 'Deep learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Objective: This study was intended to develop two risk assessment systems that can evaluate OWAS scores and action level with good accuracy and reliability to prevent work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs).Background: Since risk assessment methods such as OWAS and REBA are relied on visual observations, their accuracy and reliability might have been in questions. Therefore, computer-aided risk assessment systems are necessary to enhance accuracy and reliability as well as to improve applicability in workplaces.Method: This study developed vector-based OWAS (V-OWAS) and deep learning-based OWAS (DL-OWAS). V-OWAS (partial automation) asks a user to manually identify the key joint positions from a working picture and automatically calculates OWAS scores and action level. DL-OWAS (high automation) automatically identifies the key positions and determines OWAS scores and action level. To evaluate the performance of the two systems, we used 40 working pictures and compared the results of the two systems with the results of four ergonomic experts with over 10-year experience who did assess based on traditional visual observations.Results: The two systems showed similar assessment results with those obtained from the ergonomic experts. The agreement percentage of V-OWAS (91.3%) with the experts was slightly better than DL-OWAS (90%). On the other hand, the usability score of DL-OWAS (7 out of 7 point Likert scale) was significantly higher than V-OWAS (5.75) and traditional visual observation (5.25).Conclusion: V-OWAS had an advantage in accuracy of identifying the key joint positions; but it required more time and efforts over DL-OWAS. DL-OWAS can assess automatically; but its accuracy might be low if some parts of the body are obscured due to some reasons (e.g., obscured by some machine). Therefore, it is recommended to use V-OWAS or DL-OWAS according to the condition of working picture.Application: The two OWAS systems developed in this study can help industrial practitioners effectively and efficiently assess working posture for preventing WMSDs."

Therefore, oil spill detection is essential for marine protection, which motivated this study. Detection with radar, which is based on electromagnetic waves, is achieved using satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR); thus, real-time detection over a small range is difficult. Hence, in this study, an oil spill detection system based on thermal imaging using a long-wave infrared (LWIR) camera is proposed. The oil spill detection algorithm utilizes the You Only Look Once (YOLO) model, which is widely used for object detection. In addition, 1,644 thermal images were labeled to evaluate the proposed system. The training and test results showed an accuracy of 96.91% and false alarm rate of 8.33%.

The work proposes an efficient CNN architecture to recognize human facial expressions that consist of five stages containing a combination of lightweight convolution operations. It introduces the efficient contextual extractor with a partial transfer module to suppress computational compression. This technique is applied to the mid and high-level features by separating the channel-based input features into two parts. Then it applies sequential convolution to only one part and combines it with the previous separated part. A shuffle channel group is used to exchange the information extracted. The structure of the entire network generates less than a million parameters. The CK+ and KDEF datasets are used as training and test sets to evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture. As a result, the proposed classifier obtains an accuracy that is competitive with other methods.

The trials were conducted to identify deformations in a 1.5 T MR image according to the 0.06 T MR image to fit the image and size of the unpaired set. Afterwards, the cyclic-generative adversarial network (GAN) was applied to produce an artificial MR image of the 0.06 T MR image with reference to the original or the deformed 1.5 T MR image. In the end, an improved 0.06 T MR image was produced using the traditional GAN supplemented by the artificial MR image. T2 and flair MR images were verified for matching T1 and T2 testing models in the context of the traditional GAN. The outcomes relating to the optimized trial based on the improved MR image indicated a measurable improvement of the signal with a positive relationship between the original and the improved images. Quantitative variables were applied to assess the quality of the images, along with other settings, such as the signal improvement ratio and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), as well as the variable between the original and the improved MR images.

Deep learning convolutional neural network algorithms for the early detection and diagnosis of dental caries on periapical radiographs: A systematic review,2021,"['Deep Learning', 'Neural Network Models', 'Dental Caries', 'Radiography', 'Dental']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to analyse and review deep learning convolutional neural networks for detecting and diagnosing early-stage dental caries on periapical radiographs. Materials and Methods: In order to conduct this review, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses(PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Studies published from 2015 to 2021 under the keywords(deep convolutional neural network) AND (caries), (deep learning caries) AND (convolutional neural network) AND (caries) were systematically reviewed. Results: When dental caries is improperly diagnosed, the lesion may eventually invade the enamel, dentin, and pulp tissue, leading to loss of tooth function. Rapid and precise detection and diagnosis are vital for implementing appropriate prevention and treatment of dental caries. Radiography and intraoral images are considered to play a vital role in detecting dental caries; nevertheless, studies have shown that 20% of suspicious areas are mistakenly diagnosed as dental caries using this technique; hence, diagnosis via radiography alone without an objective assessment is inaccurate. Identifying caries with a deep convolutional neural network-based detector enables the operator to distinguish changes in the location and morphological features of dental caries lesions. Deep learning algorithms have broader and more profound layers and are continually being developed, remarkably enhancing their precision in detecting and segmenting objects. Conclusion: Clinical applications of deep learning convolutional neural networks in the dental field have shown significant accuracy in detecting and diagnosing dental caries, and these models hold promise in supporting dental practitioners to improve patient outcomes."

A fully deep learning model for the automatic identification of cephalometric landmarks,2021,"['Anatomic Landmarks', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Dental Digital Radiography', 'Deep Learning', 'Neural Network Models']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Purpose: This study aimed to propose a fully automatic landmark identification model based on a deep learning algorithm using real clinical data and to verify its accuracy considering inter-examiner variability. Materials and Methods: In total, 950 lateral cephalometric images from Yonsei Dental Hospital were used. Two calibrated examiners manually identified the 13 most important landmarks to set as references. The proposed deep learning model has a 2-step structure-a region of interest machine and a detection machine-each consisting of 8 convolution layers, 5 pooling layers, and 2 fully connected layers. The distance errors of detection between 2 examiners were used as a clinically acceptable range for performance evaluation. Results: The 13 landmarks were automatically detected using the proposed model. Inter-examiner agreement for all landmarks indicated excellent reliability based on the 95% confidence interval. The average clinically acceptable range for all 13 landmarks was 1.24 mm. The mean radial error between the reference values assigned by 1 expert and the proposed model was 1.84 mm, exhibiting a successful detection rate of 36.1%. The A-point, the incisal tip of the maxillary and mandibular incisors, and ANS showed lower mean radial error than the calibrated expert variability. Conclusion: This experiment demonstrated that the proposed deep learning model can perform fully automatic identification of cephalometric landmarks and achieve better results than examiners for some landmarks. It is meaningful to consider between-examiner variability for clinical applicability when evaluating the performance of deep learning methods in cephalometric landmark identification."
Use of Deep Learning Image Classification Models and Vehicle Mounted Cameras for Automatic Pavement Pothole Detection,2021,"['Pavement Distress Detection', 'Urgent Maintenance', 'Deep Learning Image Classification', 'Vehicle Mounted Camera']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"PURPOSES : This study uses deep learning image classification models and vehicle-mounted cameras to detect types of pavement distress — such as potholes, spalling, punch-outs, and patching damage — which require urgent maintenance. METHODS : For the automatic detection of pavement distress, the optimal mount location on a vehicle for a regular action camera was first determined. Using the orthogonal projection of obliquely captured surface images, morphological operations, and multi-blob image processing, candidate distressed pavement images were extracted from road surface images of a 16,036 km in-lane distance. Next, the distressed pavement images classified by experts were trained and tested for evaluation by three deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) models: GoogLeNet, AlexNet, and VGGNet. The CNN models were image classification tools used to identify and extract the combined features of the target images via deep layers. Here, a data augmentation technique was applied to produce big distress data for training. Third, the dimensions of the detected distressed pavement patches were computed to estimate the quantity of repair materials needed. RESULTS : It was found that installing cameras 1.8 m above the ground on the exterior rear of the vehicle could provide clear pavement surface images with a resolution of 1 cm per pixel. The sensitivity analysis results of the trained GoogLeNet, AlexNet, and VGGNet models were 93 %, 86 %, and 72 %, respectively, compared to 62.7 % for the dimensional computation. Following readjustment of the image categories in the GoogLeNet model, distress detection sensitivity increased to 94.6 %. CONCLUSIONS : These findings support urgent maintenance by sending the detected distressed pavement images with the dimensions of the distressed patches and GPS coordinates to local maintenance offices in real-time."

Background: In general, when people pick a watermelon with good sugar content at the supermarket, they not only take a close look at them with their eyes, but also tend to tap and listen to them. As a result of the interview in this study, experienced fruit merchants can classify the watermelons with good sugar content just by tapping them and listening to the sound. Method: In order to develop and verify a deep learning model for classifying sugar content based on the tapping sound of watermelons, about 4,000 sound data were collected from about 700 watermelons at Cheongnyangni fruit market and Yangpyeong Cheongwoon distribution center classifying watermelons with a non-destructive measuring device. The sound data of the watermelon was measured at a distance of 1 to 2 ㎝ using the iPhone (11 Pro) after tapping the center of the watermelon with the palm of the hand. Noise was not separately controlled when collecting the sound data. The classes of the watermelon were divided into four categories: low quality or hollow, 10brix, 11brix, and 12brix. Results: We have applied MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) deep learning models to classify this collected sound data, showing accuracies of 96.66% and 95.28%, respectively. Finally, we verified the model using data that was not used for learning and confirmed that it was classified correctly. Conclusion: It has been shown that watermelon sugar content can be classified with high precision based on sound deep learning, just like a human taps a watermelon to hear the sound and filter out a good watermelon.

A deep learning technique that utilizes the deep belief network algorithm is used. Performance tests are executed ten times with the ten-fold method, learning nine folds as training signals and testing the other fold as the unknown signal. With the proposed method, experimental results demonstrate 98% classification performance against unknown radar signals for which the conventional method is unsuitable."

The introduction of vaccines since early 2021 is expected to significantly control and reduce the cases. However, virus mutations and its new variant has challenged these expectations. Several countries, which contained the COVID-19 pandemic successfully in the first wave, failed to repeat the same in the second and third waves. This work focuses on COVID-19 pandemic control and management in Saudi Arabia. This work aims to predict new cases using deep learning using various important factors.

Special consideration has been given to the evolving factors that are responsible for recent surges in the pandemic. For this purpose, two weights are assigned to data instance which are based on feature importance and dynamic weight-based time. Older data is given fewer weights and vice-versa. Feature selection identifies the factors affecting the rate of new cases evolved over the period. The DLDW method produced 80.39% prediction accuracy, 6.54%, 9.15%, and 7.19% higher than the three other classifiers, Deep learning (DL), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM).

This paper adopted the BERTLARGE model which was pretrained with the CoLA dataset. The dataset which was used in the current study were composed of 480 sentences. Among them, 80 sentences came from the target sentences in Lee and Park (2018), and 400 sentences from the CoLA dataset. These 480 sentences were used as an input to the BERTLARGE model, and the acceptability scores were calculated. Unlike previous deep learning models for syntactic acceptability, however, this paper calculated the probability where the given sentence could be acceptable, and the probability was converted into the acceptability scores. After the acceptability scores were obtained for all the target sentences, they were normalized into the z-scores. Statistical analyses were applied to them to compare the results of the BERTLARGE model and the experimental results in Lee and Park (2018). As a result, it was found that the results of the BERTLARGE model showed patterns similar to those in Sprouse et al. (2012) and Lee and Park (2018). Through the analysis, the followings were observed: (i) deep learning models could represent human beings’ syntactic acceptability to a considerable extends, (ii) the BERTLARGE model clearly identified the English island constraints, and (iii) both main factors (Island and Location) and their interaction (Island:Location) influenced the acceptability scores of island sentences."

This type of approach corresponds to the method of ethics which based on moral principles. However, complex and unpre-dictable problems are likely to arise when it comes to AI ethics. In order to solve these problems, it is necessary to extract the principles of the AI Code of Ethics by establishing and presenting ethical principles through researching and analyzing various individual events related to AI Ethics using deep learning and Big Data Based AI.Conclusion: The following effects can be achieved by using deep learning techniques and Big Data Based AI that contains Ethical Issues together with sound and desirable Moral Judgement on each case, to derive the principles of the AI code of ethics. First, it is possible to extract and secure Big Data as basic resource of presenting Ethical Directions on various ethical problems arising in connection with the development of AI technology. Second, since the Ethical Principles as AI Code of Ethics are established based on empirical data, the validity of the principles can be secured. On the other hand, the AI Code of Ethics derived through deep learning based on such Big Data is likely to result in multiple tyranny or errors of majority due to certain limitations.

The purpose of this study was to develop a predictive model for the mitotic index of local primary GIST, based on deep learning algorithm.Materials and Methods: Abdominal contrast-enhanced CT images of 148 pathologically confirmed GIST cases were retrospectively collected for the development of a deep learning classification algorithm. The areas of GIST masses on the CT images were retrospectively labelled by an experienced radiologist. The postoperative pathological mitotic count was considered as the gold standard (high mitotic count, > 5/50 high-power fields [HPFs]; low mitotic count, ≤ 5/50 HPFs). A binary classification model was trained on the basis of the VGG16 convolutional neural network, using the CT images with the training set (n = 108), validation set (n = 20), and the test set (n = 20). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated at both, the image level and the patient level. The receiver operating characteristic curves were generated on the basis of the model prediction results and the area under curves (AUCs) were calculated. The risk categories of the tumors were predicted according to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology criteria.Results: At the image level, the classification prediction results of the mitotic counts in the test cohort were as follows: sensitivity 85.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.834–0.877), specificity 67.5% (95% CI: 0.636–0.712), PPV 82.1% (95% CI: 0.797–0.843), NPV 73.0% (95% CI: 0.691–0.766), and AUC 0.771 (95% CI: 0.750–0.791). At the patient level, the classification prediction results in the test cohort were as follows: sensitivity 90.0% (95% CI: 0.541–0.995), specificity 70.0% (95% CI: 0.354–0.919), PPV 75.0% (95% CI: 0.428–0.933), NPV 87.5% (95% CI: 0.467–0.993), and AUC 0.800 (95% CI: 0.563–0.943).Conclusion: We developed and preliminarily verified the GIST mitotic count binary prediction model, based on the VGG convolutional neural network. The model displayed a good predictive performance."
Characterization and Engineering of Microbial Metabolism Using Deep Learning,2021,"['Bio big data', 'Metabolic engineering', 'Deep learning', 'DeepEC', 'DeepRFC']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Successful bioprocess requires accurate understanding and optimal engineering of a production host’s metabolism. Optimization of a bioprocess has now been better facilitated by the increasing availability of bio big data and the use of machine learning methods [1, 2]. Here, two deep learning models will be presented, namely DeepEC [3] and DeepRFC [4]. DeepEC is a deep learning model that predicts enzyme commission (EC) numbers with high precision in a high-throughput manner by taking a protein sequence as an input [3]. Prediction of EC numbers is essential for accurately understanding enzyme functions and metabolism, especially during genome annotation. Meanwhile, DeepRFC examines the feasibility of a large number of retrobiosynthesis- derived enzymatic reactions [4]. Retrobiosynthesis helps systematically design novel biosynthetic pathways for the production of a target chemical, but often generates a very large number of candidate reactions, which makes experimental validation challenging. DeepRFC can facilitate the implementation of retrobiosynthesis by substantially reducing a large number of candidate enzymatic reactions. Continued efforts in developing computational platform technologies along with generation of meaningful biological datasets will innovate our approaches to developing bioprocesses."
A High-Precision Feature Extraction Network of Fatigue Speech from Air Traffic Controller Radiotelephony Based on Improved Deep Learning,2021,"['Air traffic control', 'Fatigue', 'SSAE', 'Active learning', 'Dense block', 'Spectrogram']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Air traffic controller (ATC) fatigue is receiving considerable attention in recent studies because it represents a major cause of air traffic incidences. Research has revealed that the presence of fatigue can be detected by analysing speech utterances. However, constructing a complete labelled fatigue data set is very time-consuming. Moreover, a manually constructed speech collection will often contain only little key information to be used effectively in fatigue recognition, while multilevel deep models based on such speech materials often have overfitting problems due to an explosive increase of model parameters. To address these problems, a novel deep learning framework is proposed in this study to integrate active learning (AL) into complex speech features selected from a large set of unlabelled speech data in order to overcome the loss of information. A shallow feature set is first extracted using stacked sparse autoencoder networks, in which fatigue state challenge features from a manually selected speaker set of are exploited as the input vector. A densely connected convolutional autoencoder (DCAE) is then proposed to learn advanced features automatically from spectrograms of the selected data to supplement the fatigue features. The network can be effectively trained using a relatively small number of labelled samples with the help of AL sampling strategies, and the addition of a dense block to the convolutional automatic encoder can decrease the number of parameters and make the model easier to fit. Finally, the two above-mentioned features are combined using multiple kernel learning with a support-vector-machine classifier. A series of comparative experiments using the Civil Aviation Administration of China radiotelephony corpus demonstrates that the proposed method provides a significant improvement in the detection precision compared to current state-of-the-art approaches."

Such categorization has many applications in automated question-answering systems, and in manual systems in routing the questions to a specialized Mufti to answer specific topics. In this work we tackle the problem of automatic categorisation of Islamic jurisprudential legal questions using deep learning techniques. In this paper, we build a hierarchical deep learning model that first extracts the question text features at two levels: word and sentence representation, followed by a text classifier that acts upon the question representation. To evaluate our model, we build and release the largest publicly available dataset of Islamic questions and answers, along with their topics, for 52 topic categories. We evaluate different state-of-the art deep learning models, both for word and sentence embeddings, comparing recurrent and transformer-based techniques, and performing extensive ablation studies to show the effect of each model choice. Our hierarchical model is based on pre-trained models, taking advantage of the recent advancement of transfer learning techniques, focused on Arabic language."

Reproduction strategy of radiation data with compensation of data loss using a deep learning technique,2021,"['Deep learning', 'U-net algorithm', 'Radiation map', 'Sensor network system', 'Reproduction']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In nuclear-related facilities, such as nuclear power plants, research reactors, accelerators, and nuclear waste storage sites, radiation detection, and mapping are required to prevent radiation overexposure. Sensor network systems consisting of radiation sensor interfaces and wxireless communication units have become promising tools that can be used for data collection of radiation detection that can in turn be used to draw a radiation map. During data collection, malfunctions in some of the sensors can occasionally occur due to radiation effects, physical damage, network defects, sensor loss, or other reasons. This paper proposes a reproduction strategy for radiation maps using a U-net model to compensate for the loss of radiation detection data. To perform machine learning and verification, 1,561 simulations and 417 measured data of a sensor network were performed. The reproduction results show an accuracy of over 90%. The proposed strategy can offer an effective method that can be used to resolve the data loss problem for conventional sensor network systems and will specifically contribute to making initial responses with preserved data and without the high cost of radiation leak accidents at nuclear facilities."

Deep learning for computer-assisted diagnosis of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer,2021,"['Machine learning', 'Pathology', 'Computer-assisted diagnosis', 'Stomach neoplasms', 'Deep learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Background: Patients with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer often undergo prophylactic gastrectomy to minimize cancer risk. Because intramucosal poorly cohesive carcinomas in this setting are typically not grossly visible, many pathologists assess the entire gastrectomy specimen microscopically. With 150 or more slides per case, this is a major time burden for pathologists. This study utilizes deep learning methods to analyze digitized slides and detect regions of carcinoma. Methods: Prophylactic gastrectomy specimens from seven patients with germline CDH1 mutations were analyzed (five for training/validation and two for testing, with a total of 133 tumor foci). All hematoxylin and eosin slides containing cancer foci were digitally scanned, and patches of size 256 × 256 pixels were randomly extracted from regions of cancer as well as from regions of normal background tissue, resulting in 15,851 images for training/validation and 970 images for testing. A model with DenseNet-169 architecture was trained for 150 epochs, then evaluated on images from the test set. External validation was conducted on 814 images scanned at an outside institution. Results: On individual patches, the trained model achieved a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9986. This enabled it to maintain a sensitivity of 90% with a false-positive rate of less than 0.1%. On the external validation dataset, the model achieved a similar ROC AUC of 0.9984. On whole slide images, the network detected 100% of tumor foci and correctly eliminated an average of 99.9% of the non-cancer slide area from consideration. Conclusions: Overall, our model shows encouraging progress towards computer-assisted diagnosis of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer."
Efficient Deep Learning Model for Data-Limited Modulation Recognition,2021,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Deep learning (DL) has been successfully applied for modulation recognition tasks. Most of the existing applications pay little attention to the volume of data used. In reality, real historic data for modulation recognition could be limited. Thus it is better to train recognition models on small amounts of data. This is however a huge challenge, since the performance of DL models depend on sufficient data. In this paper, we introduce an efficient system model based on CNN and different data augmentation methods, for the purpose of modulation recognition. Our system employs random rotation, flip, zoom, random shift and resize methods for data augmentation. The CNN model employs small filter sizes, pooling layers, and dropout layers to improve the network. We apply a small dataset consisting of 40 constellation images per modulation type, to the system. We further analyze the performance based on three data augmentation intervals. From our experiments, the model achieved an accuracy of 32% without data augmentation and 76.07%, 35.71% and 96.42% on the three data-augmentation intervals."

Even though it is rechargeable, it suffers from irreversible capacity loss during repeated charge-discharge cycles since the inactive part of battery keeps growing as time passes by. Therefore, it is required to understand the behavior of capacity fade trend or estimate the state of health (SOH) in the long term to forecast the remaining useful life (RUL) of a battery so that users can replace it in the right time [1]. The conventional ways to estimate SOH and RUL are threefold: physics-based approach, data-driven approach, and hybrid approach [2, 3]. Although most previous studies focus on the first two methods for their prominent and distinctive advantages, the hybrid approach has recently been shown to have the potential to replace them as it leverages the strengths of both sides. In this study, physics-infused neural network, a recursive deep neural network designed based on a typical LiFePO battery degradation model which reflects the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation inside a battery cell, is investigated for the estimation of SOH and RUL simultaneously in real-time. The proposed method outperforms a number of purely data-driven models such as MLP, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM implying the general guidance effect of physics infusion for parameter optimization in training. Such effect has been investigated by varying the number of train data, and also by removing the physics-based part of the recurrent neural network cell."

Consequently, a model was generated for specific seasons which indicates these models did not consider physical constraints between different target seasons and forecast lead times, thereby leading to arbitrary fluctuations in the predicted time series. To overcome this problem and account for ENSO seasonality, we developed an all-season convolutional neural network (A_CNN) model. The correlation skill of the ENSO index was particularly improved for forecasts of the boreal spring, which is the most challenging season to predict. Moreover, activation map values indicated a clear time evolution with increasing forecast lead time. The study findings reveal the comprehensive role of various climate precursors of ENSO events that act differently over time, thus indicating the potential of the A_CNN model as a diagnostic tool."
Gender Prediction from Masked Face Images using Deep Learning towards Smart Store Customer Management,2021,"['Deep Learning', 'Gender Prediction', 'Masked Face', 'Smart Store']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In this study, authors aimed to predict the gender of a customer with face mask to manage the customer data, targeted advertisement, and future of retail. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic situation, a customer must wear a face mask, avoid contacts with store staffs and should stay for short period of times while shopping. Smart store can meet the requirements by knowing the customer gender to find the right item. Predicting gender from faces with mask is a perplexing task due to two main reasons: 1) the lack of large benchmark datasets of masked faces, and 2) the deficiency of facial cues from the masked regions. Faces in the unconstraint environment have various orientations and occlusion degrees, where no less than one part of each face is occluded by mask. The traditional machine learning approaches are suffering in performance with the heterogeneity of the images in the non-benchmark dataset. This research proposes an automatic gender prediction system deploying deep learning networks; GoogleNet and ResNet50 those are pretrained with huge amount of image data. The extensive experiments demonstrate a noteworthy prediction accuracy (83%) even though the amount of available masked face data is very limited. Furthermore, this is the first work of gender prediction with the real masked face dataset heretofore."

Compression of deep learning models through global weight pruning using ADMM,2021,"['Weight Pruning', 'ADMM', 'Removal ratio']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Deep learning, which has recently shown excellent performance, has a problem that the amount of computation and required memory are large. Model compression is very useful because it saves memory and reduces storage size while maintaining model performance. Model compression methods reduce the number of edges by pruning weights that are deemed unnecessary in the calculation. Existing weight pruning methods using ADMM construct an optimization problem by a layer-by-layer addition of pre-defined removal-ratio constraints. Decomposing into two subproblems through the ADMM process, one can solve them through gradient descent and projection. However, the layer-by-layer removal ratios must be structurally specified, causing a sharp increase in training time due to a large number of parameters, and hardly feasible to use for large models that actually require weight pruning. Our proposed method performs weight pruning, producing similar performance, by setting a global removal ratio for the entire model without prior knowledge of structural characteristics in order to solve the shortcomings of the existing ADMM weight-pruning methods. To effectively avoid performance degradation, the method removes a relatively small number of previous layers in charge of feature extraction. Experiments show high-quality performance, not necessarily setting layer-by-layer removal ratios. Additionally, experiments increasing layers yield an insight for feature extraction in pruned layers. The experiment of the proposed method to the LeNet-5 model using MNIST data results in a higher compression ratio of 99.3% outperforming those of other existing algorithms. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in YOLOv4, an object detection model requiring substantial computation."

Initial 100-mAs survey images and 50-mAs intraprocedural images were reconstructed by filtered back projection. Denoising was performed using a vendor-agnostic DL model (ClariCT.AITM, ClariPI) for the 50-mAS images, and the 50-mAs, denoised 50-mAs, and 100-mAs CT images were compared. Noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and edge rise distance (ERD) for image sharpness were measured. The data were summarized as the mean ± standard deviation for these parameters. Two musculoskeletal radiologists assessed the visibility of the normal anatomical structures.Results: Noise was lower in the denoised 50-mAs images (36.38 ± 7.03 Hounsfield unit [HU]) than the 50-mAs (93.33 ± 25.36 HU) and 100-mAs (63.33 ± 16.09 HU) images (p < 0.001). The SNRs for the images in descending order were as follows: denoised 50-mAs (1.46 ± 0.54), 100-mAs (0.99 ± 0.34), and 50-mAs (0.58 ± 0.18) images (p < 0.001). The denoised 50-mAs images had better edge sharpness than the 100-mAs images at the vertebral body (ERD; 0.94 ± 0.2 mm vs. 1.05 ± 0.24 mm, p = 0.036) and the psoas (ERD; 0.42 ± 0.09 mm vs. 0.50 ± 0.12 mm, p = 0.002). The denoised 50-mAs images significantly improved the visualization of the normal anatomical structures (p < 0.001).Conclusion: DL-based reconstruction may enable simultaneous noise reduction and improvement in image quality with the preservation of edge sharpness on low-dose lumbar spine CT. Investigations on further radiation dose reduction and the clinical applicability of this technique are warranted."
Integrated Deep Learning Framework for Accelerated Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography,2021,"['Convolutional neural network (CNN)', 'deep learning (DL)', 'generative adversarial network (GAN)', 'high-speed imaging', 'optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA)', 'two-stage network']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) has become a premium imaging tool in clinics to obtain structural and functional information of microvasculatures. One primary technical drawback for OCTA is its imaging speed. The current protocols require high sampling density and multiple acquisitions of cross-sectional B-scans to form one image frame, resulting in low acquisition speed. Recently, deep learning (DL)-based methods have gained attention in accelerating the OCTA acquisition process. They achieve faster acquisition using two independent reconstructing approaches: high-quality angiograms from a few repeated B-scans and high-resolution angiograms from undersampled data. While these approaches have shown promising results, they provide limited solutions that only partially account for the OCTA scanning mechanism. Herein, we propose an integrated DL method to tackle both factors in tandem and further enhance the reconstruction performance in speed and quality. We designed two-stage convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to reconstruct fully-sampled, high-quality (8 repeated B-scans) angiograms from their corresponding undersampled, low-quality (2 repeated B-scans) counterparts by successively enhancing the pixel resolution and the image quality. Using an in-vivo mouse brain vasculature dataset, we evaluate our proposed models through quantitative and qualitative assessments and demonstrate that our method can achieve superior reconstruction performance compared to conventional interpolation-based methods."

Estimation of Change in Global Mean Temperature Based on Machine/Deep Learning of Global Data,2021,"['Machine/deep learning', 'SVM', 'ANN', 'Temperature change', 'GHG emission']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Continuous increase in anthropogenic CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission can cause rise in global mean temperature (GMT). Many studies have been made to build climate models for the estimation of change in GMT based on several climate factors such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and net ecosystem exchange (NEE). However, the complexity of the climate factors possibly causes uncertainties in climate models leading to an inaccurate estimation of GMT. To overcome the uncertainties, this study applies machine and deep learning (M/DL) methods to the analysis on the relationship links between climate factors and changes in GMT. The pattern learning ability supports more objective analysis on climate models. The input data of climate factors include CO<SUB>2</SUB> and non-CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration, and NEE global data during 1999~2012, which are currently available. The available data were mostly annual, thus were interpolated to generate more data for the training process of DL. The open-source library of support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods were used. A better-trained model was observed from the ANN with more interpolated data, whereas SVM had difficulty in finding optimal prediction parameters due to the high non-linearity input data."

A Deep Learning Approach for Human Activity Classifier Using Image Data Sets,2021,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Human activity recognition (HAR) plays a significant role in health monitoring systems. Most HAR systems use special sensors to identify the user activities. The user activities in the HAR system are divided into basic and compound activities. Sensor-based HAR systems give accurate activity classification results for basic activities. However, when the system has to identify compound activities, the error from the sensors gives poor classification results. To overcome this issue in the HAR systems, we propose a human activity classifier (HAC) using image data instead of sensor data and the proposed HAC shows accurate classification results for compound activities. The proposed HAC system takes the advantages associated with deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) to accurately classify the user activities. The experiment results show that the proposed HAC approach achieves 98% model accuracy for activity recognition with 0.012 cross entropy error which is better than other deep learning architectures."

A Deep Learning Based Approach for Strawberry Yield Prediction via Semantic Graphics,2021,"['semantic graphics', 'yield forecasting', 'crop management', 'segmentation', 'deep learning', 'encoder-decoder cnn']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In Korea, strawberry producers lack efficient and precise yield forecasts, which would allow them to deploy optimal manpower, equipment, and other resources for harvesting, shipping, and marketing. Reliable estimation of the quantity of strawberry fruit with respect to their ripeness level is critical for forecasting the upcoming strawberry production. Typically, the quantity and ripeness of fruits are estimated manually, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this case, automated yield prediction based on robotic agriculture is a realistic option. We provide in this study an automated strawberry fruit recognition and counting system for accurate and reliable yield prediction. This paper proposes a unique neural network training approach for strawberry fruit counting and ripeness detection that combines semantic graphics for data annotation with a fully convolutional neural network (FCN). Semantic graphics, the suggested data annotation approach, is straightforward to apply, and the desired targets can be quickly tagged with little effort. Moreover, the proposed FCN is an enhanced encoder-decoder network designed specifically for efficient learning of semantic graphics.

However, the pre-trained models have certain constraints in terms of their architecture. For example, the state-of-the-art pre-trained models expect an input image with three-color channels because of the wide availability of color images. However, there are certain domains, e.g., medical applications, where grayscale images are produced and the models are required to perform certain tasks on them. Therefore, in this work we propose an approach to run pre-trained models on grayscale images while benefiting from transfer learning for multiclass classification task. We have used the MobileNetV2 pre-trained model to classify the CIFAR datasets.

The optimum amount of the factors participating in the mechanism of the fully connected neural network are achieved through the optimizer based on the momentum. The positive side of the mentioned approach employed in this investigation would be due to its high accuracy along with lower epochs required for training the multi-layered network. This scrutinization would be semi-computational research that estimates the vibrational behavior of a MEEAD employing a non-classical continuum model known as the modified couple stress (MCS) model. First-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) and shell model would be provided for presenting their displacement fields. Then, Kelvin-Voight theory has been applied to model the viscoelastic foundation. Its non-classical governing equations, as well as related boundary conditions (BCs) of small-scaled MEEAD, would be achieved by considering the symmetric spinning gradient along with higher-order stress tensors for the strain energy. The provided non-classical theory would be able to capture the small scale in the MEEAD employing just one length scale of a material factor, then, the mathematical modeling of MEEAD according to the classical theory would be able to be recovered from the provided model by eliminating the material length scale factor. Ultimately, the non-classical governing equations would be solved by applying the generalized differential quadrature (GDQ) approach for multifarious BCs. Moreover, parametric research has been conducted to analyze the influences of the viscoelastic foundation, length scale factor, geometry of MEE, radial and circumferential mode number, radius ratio, and BCs on the frequency behavior of the MEEAD by applying MCST. The outcomes reveal that there would be a crucial radius ratio in which the relationship between these elements and crucial inserted voltage alters from direct to indirect relation."

Fully Autonomous Deep Learning RGB-D Vision-based Object Manipulation with an Anthropomorphic Robotic Hand,2021,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Fully autonomous object grasping with robotic hands is under active investigation because autonomous vision and motor control is required. Vision allows a robotic hand interact with the environment by estimating the grasping parameters (i.e., grasping position and orientation) for manipulation. Motor control generates the motion parameters to reach an object and manipulate (e.g., grasping and relocation). In this work, deep learning RGB-D vision is used to detect the object and generate the grasping parameters of position and orientation. An anthropomorphic robotic hand system composed of UR3 robotic arm and qb soft hand is used for motor functions of object grasping and relocation. Our autonomous object manipulation system first detects and locates an object from RGB images using FastRCNN. Then, a partial depth view of the object is generated to estimate the grasping position and orientation of the object. Finally, the robotic hand system is used to grasp and relocate the object. Our autonomous object manipulation system is validated by grasping and relocating a single object of box and ball. For the box, our system achieves 8/10 successful grasping and 7/10 successful relocations, and for the ball 10/10 successful grasping and relocations."
A geometric deep learning approach for checking element-to-entity mappings in infrastructure building information models,2021,"['BIM', 'IFC', 'geometric deep learning', 'semantic integrity', 'infrastructure']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Data interoperability between domain-specific applications is a key prerequisite for building information modeling (BIM) to solidify its position as a central medium for collaboration and information sharing in the construction industry. The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) provides an open and neutral data format to standardize data exchanges in BIM, but is often exposed to data loss and misclassifications. Concretely, errors in mappings between BIM elements and IFC entities may occur due to manual omissions or the lack of awareness of the IFC schema itself, which is broadly defined and highly complex. This study explored the use of geometric deep learning models to classify infrastructure BIM elements, with the ultimate goal of automating the prechecking of BIM-to-IFC mappings. Two models with proven classification performance, Multi-View Convolutional Neural Network (MVCNN) and PointNet, were trained and tested to classify 10 types of commonly used BIM elements in road infrastructure, using a dataset of 1496 3D models. Results revealed MVCNN as the superior model with ACC and F1 score values of 0.98 and 0.98, compared with PointNet’s corresponding values of 0.83 and 0.87, respectively. MVCNN, which employs multiple images to learn the features of a 3D artifact, was able to discern subtle differences in their shapes and geometry. PointNet seems to lose the granularity of the shapes, as it uses points partially selected from point clouds."

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is associated with aging and describes early symptoms of severe cognitive impairment known as Alzheimer""s disease (AD). Meanwhile, early detection of MCIs can prevent progression to AD. Many studies have been investigated on MCI diagnose over the past decade. In this work, we measure three mental tasks (i.e., N-back, Stroop, semantic verbal fluency tasks) for 38 MCI patients and 25 healthy people. The proposed multi-class CNN-LSTM network improves classification accuracy and reduces the classification time. By classifying the fNIRS data directly and minimizing the preprocessing process without finding the region of interest channels, the reduction of data processing time was achieved. The proposed algorithm was compared with a single LSTM algorithm to validate the performance and compare the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score with standard metrics. For the proposed multi-class CNN-LSTM, the maximum classification accuracy was 83.33% when performing N-back tasks, with an average accuracy of 77.77% for all tasks. For the LSTM only, the maximum classification accuracy is 73.33% when performing N-back tasks. The average classification accuracy for all tasks is 57.77%. The results, therefore, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is superior to the LSTM, indicating the potential to be used for online classification."

A Local-Cloud Edge based Keyword Spotting using Deep Learning,2021,"['Cloud computing', 'deep learning', 'edge device', 'keyword spotting']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Objective: This study aims to develop a reliable and efficient keyword spotting (KWS) system suitable for a user interface on an edge device application. In addition, this study also aims to implement KWS on both local (to perform low-level tasks and in condition without internet access) and cloud (to perform high-level tasks). Background: KWS plays a significant role in realizing speech-based user interaction with an edge device. Existing KWS system issues include 1) low accuracy, caused by unrecognized noise signals during training and inference process, 2) high computational complexity, caused by the use of deep learning models with complex architecture, 3) internet connection dependency, caused by running main processes into cloud server, and 4) system responsiveness, can be affected by high latency in data transfer over the internet which is affected by external factors. Method: First, to increase the accuracy, crowd-sourcing techniques is used to obtain training sets which includes variety of audio sample with different accents and voice quality. The quality of the training data is improved using signal augmentation and curation methods. Second, to reduce the computational complexity, the trained model is optimized using a quantization method. In case of increasing accuracy, signal augmentation adds background noise to the training dataset and assists the KWS model to recognize the keyword in a variety of environments. Data curation is used is to process augmented signals which include: collecting, organizing, labeling, cleaning, enhancing, and preserving data for the KWS training process. In addition to signal augmentation and curation, a Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) is used to extract the features in an audio signal. The extracted features are then restructured to an image and a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to learn the features and classify the MFCCs in each sample dataset. To further improve the accuracy, the training parameters are adjusted to achieve a validation accuracy of at least 85%. Also, regularization techniques and dropout layers are added to avoid overfitting. In KWS system deployment, the trained model is optimized to reduce memory, computing, and power consumption. Hence, model weights and activations parameters are quantized using 8-bit integers without incurring a significant loss in accuracy. The implementation utilizes the local-cloud server processing, where a local database residing in the edge server works alongside with the cloud server to execute more complex algorithm and processes. Results: The training result shows that our KWS model achieves an average accuracy and loss of 95.9% and 0.18, respectively. The raining result also reveals that the trained KWS model is ready for model testing on the edge. Furthermore, the optimization result shows the inference time, peak random access memory usage, and flash usage are reduced by 21.1%, 32.3%, and 58.5%, respectively. Conclusion: The result of model training and testing shows that the proposed KWS system has high accuracy and resource efficiency. The system also exhibits internet independence as local database is implemented locally. Application: The inference process uses two platforms: edge device and cloud server. The edge device, Arduino BLE sense microcontroller, is used to spot the keywords using optimized CNN that will produce a unique keyword identifier and is sent over to the cloud server. The identifier is used to match the keyword for its corresponding response. The cloud server sends the response of the spotted keyword to the edge device."

Quantitative Assessment of Chest CT Patterns in COVID-19 and Bacterial Pneumonia Patients: a Deep Learning Perspective,2021,"['COVID-19', 'Pneumonia', 'Bacterial', 'Computed Tomography', 'Deep Learning', 'Cluster Analysis']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Background: It is difficult to distinguish subtle differences shown in computed tomography (CT) images of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and bacterial pneumonia patients, which often leads to an inaccurate diagnosis. It is desirable to design and evaluate interpretable feature extraction techniques to describe the patient's condition.Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of 170 confirmed patients with COVID-19 or bacterial pneumonia acquired at Yeungnam University Hospital in Daegu, Korea. The lung and lesion regions were segmented to crop the lesion into 2D patches to train a classifier model that could differentiate between COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia. The K-means algorithm was used to cluster deep features extracted by the trained model into 20 groups.Each lesion patch cluster was described by a characteristic imaging term for comparison.For each CT image containing multiple lesions, a histogram of lesion types was constructed using the cluster information. Finally, a Support Vector Machine classifier was trained with the histogram and radiomics features to distinguish diseases and severity.Results: The 20 clusters constructed from 170 patients were reviewed based on common radiographic appearance types. Two clusters showed typical findings of COVID-19, with two other clusters showing typical findings related to bacterial pneumonia. Notably, there is one cluster that showed bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in the central and peripheral lungs and was considered to be a key factor for severity classification. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 91.2% for classifying COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia patients with 95% reported for severity classification. The CT quantitative parameters represented by the values of cluster 8 were correlated with existing laboratory data and clinical parameters.Conclusion: Deep chest CT analysis with constructed lesion clusters revealed well-known COVID-19 CT manifestations comparable to manual CT analysis. The constructed histogram features improved accuracy for both diseases and severity classification, and showed correlations with laboratory data and clinical parameters. The constructed histogram features can provide guidance for improved analysis and treatment of COVID-19."

Phantom study was designed to represent Aortic root and Left main coronary arty in Lungman Phantom, and reconstructed images using three algorithms. To objectively evaluate image quality, we analyze four parameters: Image noise, CT density, Signal-to-noise ratio(SNR) and Contrast-to-noise ratio(CNR) for each data. Result: AiCE reduced noise by 51.46 % compared to FBP. It was found that it was reduced by 30.13 % compared to AIDR3D. In addition, regardless of the BMI category, AiCE has a significant noise improvement effect compared to AIDR3D. AiCE showed significantly reduced noise and better image quality in the larger BMI category compared to FBP and AIDR3D. Conclusion: Compared to FBP, AIDR3D images, we find that AiCE is very effective in reducing image noise and improving parameters of images such as SNR and CNR. It was shown that the improvement effect of AiCE increased with a larger BMI."

AiCE가 적용된 ULDCT 영상은 체적이 두꺼운 upper lobe 부분에서 약 2%의 SNR 저하와 0.5%의 Noise가 증가했다. 적절한 환자의 체적 범위 내에서 선별하여 사용하는 ULDCT는 피폭 위험도를 절반 이하로 낮춰 주고 환자의 불안감을 해소하면서 최적의 영상을 획득하는 좋은 방안이 될 것으로 판단된다.","With the development of new image reconstruction techniques, ultra-low-dose chest computed tomography (ULDCT) can acquire adequate image quality even in lower does than conventional low-dose chest CT (LDCT). Recently, advanced intelligent clear-IQ engine (AiCE), an artificial intelligence-based image reconstruction algorithm, has been commercialized in the medical field. In this study, AiCE, a state-of-the-art technology, was applied to ULDCT to reconstruct both phantom and human image. The lungman phantom was examined by using LDCT and ULDCT protocols. The difference in image quality which applied existing and AiCE reconstruction methods was quantitatively analyzed by computing signal to noise ratio (SNR), noise, and dose length product values. Also, under the application of same AiCE reconstruction methods, 30 patients were tested by using LDCT protocols and another 30 patients were tested by using ULDCT protocols.I n the phantom study, the radiation dose of ULDCT was reduced by 49% compared to LDCT and ULDCT images with AiCE exhibited the highest SNR value and the lowest noise. In the patient study, the radiation dose of ULDCT was reduced by 55% compared to LDCT. In ULDCT images of thick upper lobe with AiCE, the SNR increases by about 2% and the noise decreased by 0.5% compared to LDCT. The selective usage of ULDCT within appropriate body mass index range might provide the reduction of exposure risk and the optimal images while relieving patient anxiety."

Besides, we propose an autonomous driving architecture of a pilot and copilot combination. The pilot is responsible for trajectory prediction via imitation learning with labeled driving trajectories, while the copilot is a safety module that is employed to verify the effectiveness of the vehicle trajectory by the results of the semantic segmentation auxiliary task. The proposed autonomous driving architecture is verified with a real car on urban roads without manual intervention within 40 km."

Deep Reinforcement Learning for Evaluating an Urban Network According to Comprehensive Turning Movement,2021,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Safe driving is one of important factors for evaluating the traffic service quality. Almost traffic accident were caused by human errors, which was about 94% according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (Singh, 2015). In order to solve the safe driving problem, autonomous vehicles (AVs) were getting a promising way to reduce accidents, human stress, and emissions (Crayton and Meier, 2017). Moreover, the development of cooperative intelligent transport systems (C_ITS) and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) can help to push the AVs in the real environment. Various studies mainly focused on an operation of AVs under mixed traffic environment in which the AVs will share the road with human-driven vehicles. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning, which optimized the reward to generate an appropriate policy for autonomous agents. The Markov decision process (MDP) is an original RL for full observations. In order to address the uncertain environment, the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) was applied for the partial observation MDP, such as traffic signal control (Manniona et al., 2015) and roundabout(Garc Cuenca et al., 2019)."

In an attempt to solve this, a model of a deep learning-based intrusion detection system that analyzes the pattern of intelligent attacks through data learning has emerged. Intrusion detection systems are divided into host-based and network-based depending on the installation location. Unlike network-based intrusion detection systems, host-based intrusion detection systems have the disadvantage of having to observe the inside and outside of the system as a whole. However, it has the advantage of being able to detect intrusions that cannot be detected by a network-based intrusion detection system. Therefore, in this study, we conducted a study on a host-based intrusion detection system. In order to evaluate and improve the performance of the host-based intrusion detection system model, we used the host-based Leipzig Intrusion Detection-Data Set (LID-DS) published in 2018. In the performance evaluation of the model using that data set, in order to confirm the similarity of each data and reconstructed to identify whether it is normal data or abnormal data, 1D vector data is converted to 3D image data. Also, the deep learning model has the drawback of having to re-learn every time a new cyber attack method is seen. In other words, it is not efficient because it takes a long time to learn a large amount of data. To solve this problem, this paper proposes the Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (Siamese-CNN) to use the Few-Shot Learning method that shows excellent performance by learning the little amount of data. Siamese-CNN determines whether the attacks are of the same type by the similarity score of each sample of cyber attacks converted into images. The accuracy was calculated using Few-Shot Learning technique, and the performance of Vanilla Convolutional Neural Network (Vanilla-CNN) and Siamese-CNN was compared to confirm the performance of Siamese-CNN. As a result of measuring Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-Score index, it was confirmed that the recall of the Siamese-CNN model proposed in this study was increased by about 6% from the Vanilla-CNN model."

Sparsity Increases Uncertainty Estimation in Deep Ensemble,2021,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Deep neural networks have achieved almost human-level results in various tasks and have become popular in the broad artificial intelligence domains. Uncertainty estimation is an on-demand task caused by the black-box point estimation behavior of deep learning. The deep ensemble provides increased accuracy and estimated uncertainty; however, linearly increasing the size makes the deep ensemble unfeasible for memory-intensive tasks. To address this problem, we used model pruning and quantization with a deep ensemble and analyzed the effect in the context of uncertainty metrics. We empirically showed that the ensemble members’ disagreement increases with pruning, making models sparser by zeroing irrelevant parameters. Increased disagreement implies increased uncertainty, which helps in making more robust predictions. Accordingly, an energy-efficient compressed deep ensemble is appropriate for memory-intensive and uncertainty-aware tasks."

Efficient Resource Slicing Scheme for Optimizing Federated Learning Communications in Software-Defined IoT Networks,2021,"['Deep Learning', 'Federated Learning', 'Internet of Things', 'Network Functions Virtualization', 'Software-Defined Networking']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"With the broad adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) in a variety of scenarios and application services, management and orchestration entities require upgrading the traditional architecture and develop intelligent models with ultra-reliable methods. In a heterogeneous network environment, mission-critical IoT applications are significant to consider. With erroneous priorities and high failure rates, catastrophic losses in terms of human lives, great business assets, and privacy leakage will occur in emergent scenarios. In this paper, an efficient resource slicing scheme for optimizing federated learning in software-defined IoT (SDIoT) is proposed. The decentralized support vector regression (SVR) based controllers predict the IoT slices via packet inspection data during peak hour central congestion to achieve a time-sensitive condition. In off-peak hour intervals, a centralized deep neural networks (DNN) model is used within computation-intensive aspects on fine-grained slicing and remodified decentralized controller outputs. With known slice and prioritization, federated learning communications iteratively process through the adjusted resources by virtual network functions forwarding graph (VNFFG) descriptor set up in software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV) enabled architecture. To demonstrate the theoretical approach, Mininet emulator was conducted to evaluate between reference and proposed schemes by capturing the key Quality of Service (QoS) performance metrics."
Residual Learning Based CNN for Gesture Recognition in Robot Interaction,2021,"['Convolutional Neural Network', 'Feature Redundancy', 'Full Connection Layer', 'Gesture Recognition', 'Human-Computer Interaction', 'Residual Learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The complexity of deep learning models affects the real-time performance of gesture recognition, thereby limiting the application of gesture recognition algorithms in actual scenarios. Hence, a residual learning neural network based on a deep convolutional neural network is proposed. First, small convolution kernels are used to extract the local details of gesture images. Subsequently, a shallow residual structure is built to share weights, thereby avoiding gradient disappearance or gradient explosion as the network layer deepens; consequently, the difficulty of model optimisation is simplified. Additional convolutional neural networks are used to accelerate the refinement of deep abstract features based on the spatial importance of the gesture feature distribution. Finally, a fully connected cascade softmax classifier is used to complete the gesture recognition. Compared with the dense connection multiplexing feature information network, the proposed algorithm is optimised in feature multiplexing to avoid performance fluctuations caused by feature redundancy. Experimental results from the ISOGD gesture dataset and Gesture dataset prove that the proposed algorithm affords a fast convergence speed and high accuracy."
Empirical Analysis of a Fine-Tuned Deep Convolutional Model in Classifying and Detecting Malaria Parasites from Blood Smears,2021,"['Malaria', 'Convolutional Neural Networks', 'Deep Learning', 'Fine-Tuning', 'Transfer Learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In this work, we empirically evaluated the efficiency of the recent EfficientNetB0 model to identify and diagnose malaria parasite infections in blood smears. The dataset used was collected and classified by relevant experts from the Lister Hill National Centre for Biomedical Communications (LHNCBC). We prepared our samples with minimal image transformations as opposed to others, as we focused more on the feature extraction capability of the EfficientNetB0 baseline model. We applied transfer learning to increase the initial feature sets and reduced the training time to train our model. We then fine-tuned it to work with our proposed layers and re-trained the entire model to learn from our prepared dataset. The highest overall accuracy attained from our evaluated results was 94.70% from fifty epochs and followed by 94.68% within just ten. Additional visualization and analysis using the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) algorithm visualized how effectively our fine-tuned EfficientNetB0 detected infections better than other recent state-of-the-art DCNN models. This study, therefore, concludes that when fine-tuned, the recent EfficientNetB0 will generate highly accurate deep learning solutions for the identification of malaria parasites in blood smears without the need for stringent pre-processing, optimization, or data augmentation of images."
Data Correction For Enhancing Classification Accuracy By Unknown Deep Neural Network Classifiers,2021,"['Data correction', 'Deep neural network', 'Ensemble method', 'Machine learning', 'Poisoning attack']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Deep neural networks provide excellent performance in pattern recognition, audio classification, and image recognition. It is important that they accurately recognize input data, particularly when they are used in autonomous vehicles or for medical services. In this study, we propose a data correction method for increasing the accuracy of an unknown classifier by modifying the input data without changing the classifier. This method modifies the input data slightly so that the unknown classifier will correctly recognize the input data. It is an ensemble method that has the characteristic of transferability to an unknown classifier by generating corrected data that are correctly recognized by several classifiers that are known in advance. We tested our method using MNIST and CIFAR-10 as experimental data. The experimental results exhibit that the accuracy of the unknown classifier is a 100% correct recognition rate owing to the data correction generated by the proposed method, which minimizes data distortion to maintain the data’s recognizability by humans."

The aim of this study was to compare DNN models with simple clinical score models to predict the risk of ACRN in colorectal cancer screening.Methods: Databases of screening colonoscopy from Kangbuk Samsung Hospital (n=121,794) and Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong (n=3,728) were used to develop DNN-based prediction models. Two DNN models, the Asian-Pacific Colorectal Screening (APCS) model and the Korean Colorectal Screening (KCS) model, were developed and compared with two simple score models using logistic regression methods to predict the risk of ACRN. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of the models were compared in internal and external validation databases.Results: In the internal validation set, the AUCs of DNN model 1 and the APCS score model were 0.713 and 0.662 (p<0.001), respectively, and the AUCs of DNN model 2 and the KCS score model were 0.730 and 0.667 (p< 0.001), respectively. However, in the external validation set, the prediction performances were not significantly different between the two DNN models and the corresponding APCS and KCS score models (both p >0.1).Conclusions: Simple score models for the risk prediction of ACRN are as useful as DNN-based models when input variables are limited. However, further studies on this issue are warranted to predict the risk of ACRN in colorectal cancer screening because DNN-based models are currently under improvement. (Gut Liver 2021;15:85-91)"

For its discussion, the study chose the concept of “moribund,” which facilitated the reconceptualization of curriculums, as a term reflecting the educational phenomenon best and analyzed the study culture of students in the nation based on it. There is no doubt that South Korean students are superior learners and make so remarkable achievements that they draw global attention. The reality is, however, that they spend more time on shadow education than at schools or classrooms. Thirty participants were selected through purposive sampling at six elementary, middle, and high schools. Qualitative research methods were employed to investigate how much South Korean students studied outside the school and what kind of effect it had on the school curriculums and teachers’ lessons.The findings were as follows: first, the importance of textbooks was gradually dropping in the study of students, who achieved a satisfying level in their study by making full use of workbooks and learning materials replacing textbooks; secondly, fewer and fewer students selected classroom lessons. Lessons provided at school were losing their competitive edge due to the large number of students per class, prior learning, and lower status of school teachers; and lastly, teachers’ sense of educational responsibility is diminishing. They began to explore other roles, rather than teaching students to the end, passing the buck of student education to shadow education. These findings shed light on a new area of research called shadow education in the studies on thecurriculums in the nation. The cases of South Korea’s learning culture investigated in the present study is expected to promote the understanding of curriculums and education culture of Korea, drawing a growing academic attention in Northeast Asia and across the world."

We investigated the accuracy of DCNNs for the diagnosis of epidermal cysts, lipomas, and other subcutaneous masses.Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether DCNNs could diagnose subcutaneous masses with ultrasonographic images at level of competence comparable to dermatologists.Methods: We created a dataset of 1,361 skin ultrasonography images obtained from 202 patients diagnosed with epidermal cysts, lipomas, and other subcutaneous masses, to train the DCNNs using ResNet18. Performance was compared with another set of 93 ultrasonographic images (24 epidermal cysts, 25 lipomas, and 44 other subcutaneous masses) from open-access articles.Results: The DCNNs yielded 87.10% classification accuracy and 86.10% F1-scores.

Among many challenges, traffic steering is one of the key elements which requires critically developing an optimal solution for smart guidance, control, and reliable system. Mobile edge computing (MEC), software-defined networking (SDN), network functions virtualization (NFV), and deep learning (DL) play essential roles to complementary develop a flexible computation and extensible flow rules management in this potential aspect. In this proposed system, an accurate flow recommendation, a centralized control, and a reliable distributed connectivity based on the inspection of packet condition are provided.

The augmented deep network results preserve each local instance’s importance and contribution and allow the interpretable feature representation and classification simultaneously. The comprehensive comparative analyses demonstrate that the developed model has a high-quality fault classification rate of 95.49%, on average.

The library was developed to provide an open modeling framework to simulate the climate inside the greenhouse and greenhouse energy interaction. The complex dynamics exist inside the greenhouse. The various environmental conditions also form a complex interaction between the elements. With the existing rule-based environmental control, it is challenging to achieve optimal indoor control inside a complex greenhouse. However, recently, artificial intelligence via reinforcement learning has shown excellent performance in a wide range of fields, especially in fields that require continuous control, such a building environmental control. In this study, artificial intelligence was applied to optimize the use of energy inside the greenhouse. DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) algorithm was implemented using MATLAB Reinforcement Learning toolbox. The agents were trained using Greenhouse Library, which was assumed to provide a viable and practical training approach. Despite a long training period over several repetitions, energy consumption in the greenhouse and other control factors was not improved but rather showed unrealistic control values.

Single Low-Light Ghost-Free Image Enhancement via Deep Retinex Model,2021,"['image enhancement', 'low-light image', 'Retinex model', 'image decomposition', 'super-resolution']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Low-light image enhancement is a key technique to overcome the quality degradation of photos taken under scotopic vision illumination conditions. The degradation includes low brightness, low contrast, and outstanding noise, which would seriously affect the vision of the human eye recognition ability and subsequent image processing. In this paper, we propose an approach based on deep learning and Retinex theory to enhance the low-light image, which includes image decomposition, illumination prediction, image reconstruction, and image optimization. The first three parts can reconstruct the enhanced image that suffers from low-resolution. To reduce the noise of the enhanced image and improve the image quality, a super-resolution algorithm based on the Laplacian pyramid network is introduced to optimize the image. The Laplacian pyramid network can improve the resolution of the enhanced image through multiple feature extraction and deconvolution operations. Furthermore, a combination loss function is explored in the network training stage to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Extensive experiments and comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the strength of the proposed method, the result is closer to the real-world scene in lightness, color, and details. Besides, experiments also demonstrate that the proposed method with the single low-light image can achieve the same effect as multi-exposure image fusion algorithm and no ghost is introduced."

Instructional Systems Design to Reflect ETHICS in AI’s Rules of Engagement Learning for Future Warfare,2021,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Military', 'Rules of Engagement', 'Ethics', 'Instructional Systems Design']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Purpose: Rules of Engagement(ROE) refer to rules or directives that define the circumstances, conditions, extent, manner, etc. of the application of force or action that can be considered provocative by the armed forces. ROE do not explain how results are achieved, but rather indicate what judgments are unacceptable. Focusing this, the purpose of this study is to propose an Instructional Systems Design(ISD) configured to reflect ethics in AI’s ROE learning for future warfare. Method: This study uses Development Research Method for develop and propose an ISD. ISD refers to the creation of guidelines into smaller units of teaching or learning. If some guidelines are created for such ISD, it would set the composition and application of ROE, and AI will learn that guidelines through deep learning. And the AI makes a decision with this in the hypothetical dilemma situation where the application of the ROE is requested. Finally, human experts review and supplement the learning results of these neural networks. The sophistication of the AI’s learning and applying ROE would be achieved by feeding back this result to the ISD. Results: This study understands that ROE would also be essential for AI or AI-equipped military robot systems. In this process, AI performs the task of making judgments related to applying ROE, which is the principle of action in specific situations. To do this, Ai’s deep learning first collects necessary information and makes decisions based on it. Next, the results of this learning are applied in a new hypothetical dilemma situation. Finally, human experts evaluation and feedback on the results are continuously made. This series of processes can be presented as a model of ISD oriented towards the moral development of AI. Conclusion: AI’s ROE learning converges to the learning of moral values. It focuses on the cognitive aspect of morality. Therefore, it would be possible to refine the cognitive moral judgment of deep learning by applying the learning hierarchy of taxonomy of educational objects and the logical test of validity of moral judgment oriented toward social justice. And the moral development of the neural network can be performed by modifying and complementing the results of human experts and feeding them back."

Result – Capsim simulations are designed to offer focused opportunities for deep practice. That’s why they are often more effective than passive tools such as textbooks, videos, or lectures. By the way, ‘deep practice’ is very different from ‘ordinary practice’. After commuters who drive to school or work can accumulate thousands of hours of driving, but that doesn’t make them expert drivers. The key to deep practice is self-awareness. That is, paying attention to what you are doing well and not so well. This is so important to learn that scientists use a specific term for it: ‘metacognition’, or thinking about the way you think and learn.

Materials and Methods: Source and target tasks were defined as training of the source and target networks to reconstruct cardiac CINE images from undersampled data, respectively. In transfer learning (TL), the entire neural network (NN) or some parts of the NN after conducting a source task using an open data set was adopted in the target network as the initial network to improve the learning speed and the performance of the target task. Using BTL, an NN effectively learned the target data while preserving knowledge from the source data to the maximum extent possible. The ratio of the source data to the target data was reduced stepwise from 1 in the initial stage to 0 in the final stage. Results: NN that performed BTL showed an improved performance compared to those that performed TL or standalone learning (SL). Generalization of NN was also better achieved. The learning curve was evaluated using normalized mean square error (NMSE) of reconstructed images for both target data and source data. BTL reduced the learning time by 1.25 to 100 times and provided better image quality. Its NMSE was 3% to 8% lower than with SL. Conclusion: The NN that performed the proposed BTL showed the best performance in terms of learning speed and learning curve. It also showed the highest reconstructed-image quality with the lowest NMSE for the test data set. Thus, BTL is an effective way of learning for NNs in the medical-imaging domain where both quality and quantity of data are always limited."

However, as the action space of the agent increases, the number of state-action pairs which have to be explored increases exponentially. As a result, increasing search space causes difficulty to converge the learning. To solve this problem, we propose a supervisory network. To achieve the global goal, the supervisory network creates a sub-goal and assigns the goals to the agents so that the agents can effectively learn the optimal policy with a small action space. In addition, we adapt the curriculum learning method to learn a large-scale environment. As a consequence, the agent can explore the environment in which the complexity increases gradually.

In the factory, failure prediction for facilities maintenance combined with deep learning has recently attracted much attention to researchers. To perform deep learning-based prediction, a neural network model is built and trained using the learning dataset. The training performance varies depending on the structure of the constructed neural network design. In this study, an efficient design of a neural network is explored that is expected to have the best training performance using a dataset of vibration and temperature. To do this, different neural network models are implemented, and their performance was compared by evaluating loss, accuracy, and execution time. In the experiment, the neural network model was configured to have one input layer, two or three hidden layers, and one output layer, and performance metrics values were measured according to the internal node numbers in every hidden layer. Experimental results show that losses do not increase in spite of that node number becomes large. In general, as the structure of a deep neural network model is complex and the number of nodes inside it increases, it is expected that the loss value will be smaller. For accuracy, there was almost no significant difference between all models. In the case of execution time, it took more time as the number of internal nodes of the model increased."
A Data-centric Analysis to Evaluate Suitable Machine-Learning-based Network-Attack Classification Schemes,2021,"['Machine learning', 'deep learning', 'shallow learning', 'datasets']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Since machine learning was invented, there have been many different machine learning-based algorithms, from shallow learning to deep learning models, that provide solutions to the classification tasks. But then it poses a problem in choosing a suitable classification algorithm that can improve the classification/detection efficiency for a certain network context. With that comes whether an algorithm provides good performance, why it works in some problems and not in others. In this paper, we present a data-centric analysis to provide a way for selecting a suitable classification algorithm. This data-centric approach is a new viewpoint in exploring relationships between classification performance and facts and figures of data sets."
DEMO: Deep MR Parametric Mapping with Unsupervised Multi-Tasking Framework,2021,"['Compressed sensing', 'Fast MR imaging', 'Parameter mapping', 'Unsupervised learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Compressed sensing (CS) has been investigated in magnetic resonance (MR) parametric mapping to reduce scan time. However, the relatively long reconstruction time restricts its widespread applications in the clinic. Recently, deep learningbased methods have shown great potential in accelerating reconstruction time and improving imaging quality in fast MR imaging, although their adaptation to parametric mapping is still in an early stage. In this paper, we proposed a novel deep learningbased framework DEMO for fast and robust MR parametric mapping. Different from current deep learning-based methods, DEMO trains the network in an unsupervised way, which is more practical given that it is difficult to acquire large fully sampled training data of parametric-weighted images. Specifically, a CS-based loss function is used in DEMO to avoid the necessity of using fully sampled k-space data as the label, thus making it an unsupervised learning approach. DEMO reconstructs parametric weighted images and generates a parametric map simultaneously by unrolling an interaction approach in conventional fast MR parametric mapping, which enables multi-tasking learning. Experimental results showed promising performance of the proposed DEMO framework in quantitative MR T1ρ mapping."
Application of Machine Learning under Changing Climatic Conditions,2021,"['machine learning', 'climate change', 'LSTM']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The application of machine learning/deep learning methods and techniques in Earth system modeling has increased rapidly. Such data-driven modeling approaches seek to uncover complex relationships among the system variables from training data, without prior explicit knowledge of the system processes. However, the applicability of machine learning/deep learning in non-stationary conditions, e.g. changing climate, is still poorly understood. Here we assess and compare the robustness of machine learning, and of two different process-based models, for rainfall-runoff modeling under changing conditions. Specifically, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a special kind of recurrent neural network, alongside physical (Hydrology Tiled ECMWF Scheme for Surface Exchange over Land, HTESSEL) and conceptual (Simple Water Balance Model, SWBM) models are compared. Using streamflow data from 161 catchments across Europe, we train models within a reference period (e.g. wet years) and then evaluate model performance during a climatically contrasting period (e.g. drier years). While the LSTM-based model shows rather lower robustness than the process-based models, we also find a great potential of machine learning as it can learn diverse conditions from observed spatial and temporal variability both at the same time to yield robust performance."

To prepare a future workforce that is adaptive amid a volatile employment landscape, schools should provide the necessary learning experiences to help students today develop transferrable competencies, which encompass deep conceptual understanding of domain-specific knowledge and 21st century competencies in the cognitive, intrapersonal, and interpersonal domains. In this paper, we study this possibility in the context of mathematics learning and propose a constructivist learning design (CLD) that affords students to engage in deeper learning processes. In the proposed CLD, students first work collaboratively to solve a complex problem targeting a math concept that they have yet to learn, before being engaged in instruction that builds upon their solutions in the teaching of the concept, and practices that reinforce these ideas. Testing CLD in mathematics learning at secondary level via a quasi-experimental design, we found out that (1) CLD facilitates deeper learning as it encouraged students to apply their cognitive, intrapersonal, and interpersonal competencies, and (2) CLD students (n=23) outperformed their Direct Instruction counterparts (n=18) on mathematical conceptual understanding and transfer. Overall, this study suggests that the CLD has the potential to cultivate competencies that allow students to transfer in novel situations, rendering it as a possible learning environment to better prepare students for the 4IR."

This is so important to learn that scientists use a specific term for it: 'metacognition', or thinking about the way you think and learn. Conclusion - The use of business simulation learning, such as Capsim, which is a given case, can create similar local systems by potentially engaging a large number of users in the virtual market. It could also be used as an individual to complete business training for students and those who are active in the business field of business."

However, the objective of building a high-quality ZAR system is far from being achieved even using these models. To enhance the current ZAR techniques, we fine-tuned a pretrained bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT). Notably, BERT is a general language representation model that enables systems to utilize deep bidirectional contextual information in a natural language text. It extensively exploits the attention mechanism based upon the sequence-transduction model Transformer. In our model, classification is simultaneously performed for all the words in the input word sequence to decide whether each word can be an antecedent. We seek end-to-end learning by disallowing any use of hand-crafted or dependency-parsing features.

As the flyer gets smaller, high-fidelity CFD is required as substitute for modeling aerodynamics around a flapping wing because of its unsteadiness and nonlinearity. While coupling with deep-RL to gain a control policy, the main challenge of adopting CFD is to obtain sufficient amount of data required for deep-RL due to high computational cost. In order to overcome data deficiency, a novel data reproduction method is devised. The focal point of the method is to reproduce diversified and huge amount of data from original one in terms of learning while maintaining the system dynamics unchanged. To get a control policy that works in various flow fields, multiple flyers are released in the environments with different flow speeds and share their experience with a deep-RL network. The learned network is able to make a decision on the flyer’s kinematics in temporally and spatially varying flows. The superior performance of the control policy is demonstrated through performing aerobatics in the complex flow field with abrupt disturbances."

In addition, the real-time computer vision system such as the CCTV system with image recognition functionality performs better when arrival images are sampled at a higher rate because it minimizes missing video frame feeds. However, performing it at overwhelmingly high rates exposes the system to the risk of a queue overflow that hampers the reliability of the system. In order to deal with this issue, this paper proposes a novel queue aware dynamic sampling rate adaptation algorithm that optimizes the sampling rates to maximize the computer vision performance (i.e., recognition ratio) while avoiding queue overflow under the concept of Lyapunov optimization framework. Through extensive system simulations, the proposed approaches are shown to provide remarkable gains."

We implemented a deep learning method based on a three-dimensional (3D) deep convolutional neural (CNN) network, which realizes automatic segmentation and measurement of the entire aorta (EA), true lumen (TL), and false lumen (FL). The accuracy, stability, and measurement time were compared between deep learning and manual methods. The intra- and inter-observer reproducibility of the manual method was also evaluated.Results: The mean dice coefficient scores were 0.958, 0.961, and 0.932 for EA, TL, and FL, respectively. There was a linear relationship between the reference standard and measurement by the manual and deep learning method (r = 0.964 and 0.991, respectively). The average measurement error of the deep learning method was less than that of the manual method (EA, 1.64% vs. 4.13%; TL, 2.46% vs. 11.67%; FL, 2.50% vs. 8.02%). Bland-Altman plots revealed that the deviations of the diameters between the deep learning method and the reference standard were -0.042 mm (-3.412 to 3.330 mm), -0.376 mm (-3.328 to 2.577 mm), and 0.026 mm (-3.040 to 3.092 mm) for EA, TL, and FL, respectively. For the manual method, the corresponding deviations were -0.166 mm (-1.419 to 1.086 mm), -0.050 mm (-0.970 to 1.070 mm), and -0.085 mm (-1.010 to 0.084 mm). Intra- and inter-observer differences were found in measurements with the manual method, but not with the deep learning method. The measurement time with the deep learning method was markedly shorter than with the manual method (21.7 ± 1.1 vs. 82.5 ± 16.1 minutes, p < 0.001).Conclusion: The performance of efficient segmentation and diameter measurement of TBADs based on the 3D deep CNN was both accurate and stable. This method is promising for evaluating aortic morphology automatically and alleviating the workload of radiologists in the near future."

Slowing down the refresh rate can reduce the power consumption; however, it may cause a loss of data stored in a DRAM cell, which affects the correctness of computation. This paper proposes a new memory architecture for deep learning applications, which reduces the refresh power consumption while maintaining accuracy. Utilizing the error-tolerant property of deep learning applications, the proposed memory architecture avoids the accuracy drop caused by data loss by flexibly controlling the refresh operation for different bits, depending on their criticality. For data storage in deep learning applications, the approximate DRAM architecture reorganizes the data so that these data are mapped to different DRAM devices according to their bit significance. Critical bits are stored in more frequently refreshed devices while non-critical bits are stored in less frequently refreshed devices. Compared to the conventional DRAM, the proposed approximate DRAM requires only a separation of the chip select signal for each device in a DRAM rank and a minor change in the memory controller. Simulation results show that the refresh power consumption is reduced by 66.5 % with a negligible accuracy drop on state-of-the-art deep neural networks."

Proposal of a methodology for designing engine operating variables using predicted NOx emissions based on deep neural networks,2021,['· Artificial intelligence (AI) · Deep learning (DL) · Deep neural network (DNN) · Diesel engines · NOx prediction model · Prediction in steady-state'],국문 초록 정보 없음,"The process used by engine manufacturers for the development of a new engine includes the planning and conceptual design phases, followed by the detailed design phase, in which the design target specifications are met. In the conceptual design phase, a rough specification of the target engine is presented to facilitate a detailed design and the additional cost of modification is reduced exponentially. In the conceptual design phase, however, not only is there no real engine. but there are also no 1D and 3D models present, so it is impossible to test and simulate them. Therefore, at this stage, a model that can predict emission and performance only according to the specifications and operating conditions of the engine would be very useful. Previous studies developed an EGR prediction model that can be used in the 0-D NOx prediction using a deep learning method. In this study, a NOx prediction model with high accuracy using only the operating conditions as input variables, without ECU data, was developed using deep neural networks. The developed model has high accuracy with an R-square of 0.988. The feature of this model is that all the input parameters for the deep neural network come from the operating conditions of the engine. Therefore, this model can be used in the early stages of the development of new engines when testing and simulation cannot be performed because they do not exist. The designer can set the range of the operating conditions such that they do not exceed the NOx limits at the specific operating point (specific rpm and BMEP). This variable operating design methodology is expected to be useful in the development of new engines for automobile manufacturers with various engine data."

Datasets containing 2000 images were used for training and validation of the DNN. This was done by changing the sensitivity of the AEC of the DR system to S200, S400, S800, and S1000. The changes in sensitivity generated four groups of 500 X-ray images each: overexposure, normal exposure (2), normal exposure (1), and underexposure. The results showed a classification accuracy of 93.83% and a loss 38.9%. In conclusion, through deep learning with X-ray images, an objective radiation exposure classifier was implemented and is expected to be used for the AEC of DR systems and to improve diagnostic accuracy."
A DEEP NEURAL NETWORK FOR HYPERTENSION PREDICTION USING DNA METHYLATION DATA,2021,"['deep neural network', 'hypertension', 'DNA methylation', 'epigenomics']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Exposure to environmental chemicals in modern life is ubiquitous and may cause epigenetic changes that trigger the development of hypertension. DNA methylation, the most studied epigenetic mechanism, has been considered to have a potential for detecting hypertension patients. Herein, we proposed a deep neural network to predict people with high blood pressure using epigenome-wide DNA methylation data obtained from 50 adults over 60 years old who visited the study site 3 times with ≥ 1-week interval between visits. Peripheral blood samples were collected at each visit to measure DNA methylation levels using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Hypertension was diagnosed following the World Health Organization guideline. The dataset was divided into a training set and a test set, accounting for 80% and 20%, respectively. Our proposed model consisted of two hidden Dense layers that connected an input layer with 443,612 nodes, one for each CpG site identified in our dataset, and an output layer that predicted having hypertension or not. We utilized two common activation functions, the Rectified Linear Unit and the Sigmoid function, in the hidden and output layers, respectively. The network was trained using PyTorch, Numpy, Sklearn, and Pandas libraries with a batch size of 150 for 30 epochs. Our model predicted hypertension with an 80% accuracy. This result suggests that the DNA methylation-based deep learning model is potentially useful for early hypertension detection."

Parenchymal diseases included interstitial lung disease (ILD), emphysema, nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease, tuberculous destroyed lung, pneumonia, lung cancer, and other diseases. Five experienced radiologists manually drew the margin of the lungs, slice by slice, on CT images. The dataset used to develop the network consisted of 157 cases for training, 20 cases for development, and 26 cases for internal validation. Two-dimensional (2D) U-Net and three-dimensional (3D) U-Net models were used for the task. The network was trained to segment the lung parenchyma as a whole and segment the right and left lung separately. The University Hospitals of Geneva ILD dataset, which contained high-resolution CT images of ILD, was used for external validation.Results: The Dice similarity coefficients for internal validation were 99.6 ± 0.3% (2D U-Net whole lung model), 99.5 ± 0.3% (2D U-Net separate lung model), 99.4 ± 0.5% (3D U-Net whole lung model), and 99.4 ± 0.5% (3D U-Net separate lung model). The Dice similarity coefficients for the external validation dataset were 98.4 ± 1.0% (2D U-Net whole lung model) and 98.4 ± 1.0% (2D U-Net separate lung model). In 31 cases, where the extent of ILD was larger than 75% of the lung parenchymal area, the Dice similarity coefficients were 97.9 ± 1.3% (2D U-Net whole lung model) and 98.0 ± 1.2% (2D U-Net separate lung model).Conclusion: The deep neural network achieved excellent performance in automatically delineating the boundaries of lung parenchyma with extensive pathological conditions on non-contrast chest CT images."

To alleviate this problem, we propose a similarity-based DNN that can effectively reduce the dimensionality of the data. The proposed method utilizes a kernel function to calculate pairwise similarities of observations as input, and the nonlinearity based on the similarities is then explored using a DNN. Experiment results show that the proposed method performs effectively regardless of the dataset used, implying that it can be applied as an alternative when learning a small number of high-dimensional data."

However, developing an automated PPG system is difficult, because its waveforms are susceptible to motion artifacts and between-patient variation, making its interpretation difficult. We use deep neural network (DNN) filters to mimic the cognitive ability of a human expert who can distinguish the features of PPG altered by noise from various sources. Systolic (S), onset (O), and first derivative peaks (W) are recognized by three different DNN filters. In addition, the boundaries of uninformative regions caused by artifacts are identified by two different filters. The algorithm reliably derives the HR and presents recognition scores for the S, O, and W peaks and artifacts with only a 0.7-s delay. In the evaluation using data from 11 patients obtained from PhysioNet, the algorithm yields 8643 (86.12%) reliable HR measurements from a total of 10 036 heartbeats, including some with uninformative data resulting from arrhythmias and artifacts."

Materials and Methods: Two hundred panoramic radiographs from 100 patients (50 males and 50 females) were randomly selected from a private radiological service database. Initially, 14 linear and angular measurements of the radiographs were made by an expert. Eight ratio indices derived from the original measurements were applied to a statistical algorithm to match radiographs from the same patients, simulating a semi-automated personal identification process. Subsequently, measurements were automatically generated using a deep neural network for image recognition, simulating a fully automated personal identification process. Results: Approximately 85% of the radiographs were correctly matched by the automated personal identification process. In a limited number of cases, the image recognition algorithm identified 2 potential matches for the same individual. No statistically significant differences were found between measurements performed by the expert on panoramic radiographs from the same patients. Conclusion: Personal identification might be performed with the aid of image recognition algorithms and machine learning techniques. This approach will likely facilitate the complex task of personal identification by performing an initial screening of radiographs and matching ante-mortem and post-mortem images from the same individuals."

Culture Medium Profiling and Design Assisted by Machine Learning,2021,"['cultivation', 'deep neural networks', 'machine learning', 'metabolome', 'Gaussian process optimization']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Production media for microbial cultivation is a significant factor to perform efficient cell growth and production. In industrial fermentation processes, raw materials including yeast, malt, and meat extracts, peptone, molasses, and the other agricultural and industrial waste are often used. The compositions can be varied in seasonal and geological varieties, brands, and production-lots, and influence microbial growth and material production. To understand the varieties of medium components, we have suggested that an analytical method assisted by metabolomics-like finger printing using gas-chromatogram mass spectrometry (Tachibana et al. 2019), and by deep neural networks (DNN) architecture (Tachibana et al. 2021) can apply to culture medium profiling. In the study, it was analyzed as a typical microbial cultivation that various brands of yeast extract were influenced to Escherichia coli growth and green fluorescent protein (GFP), a model of foreign protein production. According to our procedure, the bacterial growth and protein production was accurately estimated from the initial medium components profiles measured by GC-MS. Furthermore, significant components were estimated by a permutation algorithm using DNN model. The results indicated that the initial medium components can sufficiently explain the cultivation results including growth and protein production. As well, bioethanol production can be explained by the composition of toxic materials in lignocellulosic hydrolysates (Watanabe et al. 2019; Konishi 2020).To design optimal culture medium for engineered E. coli producing GFP, L81 Latin square design with 3 levels was applied to minimal medium M9 with supplemental components including amino acids and vitamins. To compare suitable machine learning algorithms for estimating GFP production, 12 algorithms, linear regression (LR), Ridge regression (Ridge), Lasso regression (Lasso), support vector machine (SVM), partial least square regression (PLS), decision tree regression (dtree), random forest regression (RFR), neural networks (NN), deep neural networks (DNN), Gradient tree boosting regression (gbr), K neighbor regression (kbr), and voting regression (vtr) were applied. According to evaluate the algorithms by cross validation (supervised: 85% and validation: 15%), although mean square errors between measured and estimated values of test data (MSEtest) were approximately 1.0-1.5 in case of LR, Ridge, Lasso, SVM, and PLS, those of dtree, RFR, gbr, NN, and DNN were in range below 0.06. On the other hand, considering interaction terms of independent variables, the data accurately fit to the all tested algorithms. The MSEtest were in range between 0.03 and 0.07. The results meant that interaction among medium components were strongly influenced to GFP production. Gaussian process optimization using trained DNN model as objective function were applied to exploring the optimal medium composition for GFP production. Based on the experimental confirmation, the improved composition increased GFP fluorescence to 117% against the best in the original experimental dataset in fact.The machine-learning-associated optimization of culture medium can provide high-throughput explore of the optimal medium compositions for not only microbial culture but also mammalian culture in theoretically. Furthermore, the idea will contribute to promote digital transformation for wide range of bioproductions.

For such safety-critical systems, it will certainly be a requirement that safe performance should be ensured even during the reinforcement learning period in the presence of system uncertainty. To address this issue, a Barrier Lyapunov Function-based safe reinforcement learning algorithm (BLF- SRL) is proposed here for the formulated nonlinear system in strict-feedback form. This approach appropriately arranges the Barrier Lyapunov Function item into the optimized backstepping control method to constrain the state-variables in the designed safety region during learning when unknown bounded system uncertainty exists. More specifically, the overall system control is optimized with the optimized backstepping technique under the framework of Actor-Critic, which optimizes the virtual control in every backstepping subsystem. Wherein, the optimal virtual control is decomposed into Barrier Lyapunov Function items; and also with an adaptive item to be learned with deep neural networks, which achieves safe exploration during the learning process. Eventually, the principle of Bellman optimality is satisfied through iteratively updating the independently approximated actor and critic to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in adaptive dynamic programming. More notably, the variance of control performance under uncertainty is also reduced with the proposed method.

The efficacy and effectiveness of the present method are supported through an extensive case study with the railway Nam O bridge. It delivers highly accurate results in assessing damage localization and damage severity for single as well as multiple damage scenarios. In addition, the robustness of this method is tested with the presence of white noise reflecting unavoidable uncertainties in signal processing and modeling in reality. The proposed approach is able to provide stable results with data corrupted by noise up to 10%."
Parameterization of Stochastically Entraining Convection Using Machine Learning Technique,2021,"['convection parameterization', 'machine learning', 'deep learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The mixing between cumulus clouds and nearby environment is one of the largest sources of uncertainty in climate modeling. The air mass flux crosses into a cloud is called the entrainment and out of a cloud is called the detrainment. A stochastic mixing model with a machine learning technique is proposed for mass flux convection schemes. The model consists of the stochastic differential equations (SDEs) for the fractional entrainment rate, fractional detrainment rate, fractional dilution rate, and vertical acceleration. Unknowns in SDEs are parameterized using a deep neural network with the inputs of cloud and environment properties. The deep neural network is found to predict entrainment and detrainment rates better than previously proposed parameterizations. The new mixing model is implemented in a unified convection scheme (UNICON) and tested in a single-column mode for two marine shallow convection cases. It is shown that the simulations with the new mixing model produce realistic mean and variance of various convective updraft properties and that the appropriate amount of stochasticity is generated. Consistently accurate simulations of updraft mass fluxes and moist conserved variables reduce model errors in the original UNICON. Additional sensitivity simulations enabling or disabling the stochasticity in mixing and initialization suggest that most of the cloud variabilities are generated from the mixing process."
Predictive maintenance of abnormal wind turbine events by using machine learning based on condition monitoring for anomaly detection,2021,['· Wind turbine · Predictive maintenance · Anomaly detection · Machine learning · Data argumentation'],국문 초록 정보 없음,"The predictive maintenance of wind turbines has become a critical issue with the rapid development of wind power generation. The early detection of abnormal operation conditions can prevent failure status, which takes a long time to recover. Energy waste can also be reduced while maintenance efficiency can be improved by using a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system to monitor the operation status of wind turbines. Massive data are generated from different sensors during wind turbine operation, and SCADA can be used to gather reports about hundreds of possible abnormal conditions. The popular maintenance methods have been mostly designed on the basis of statistical analysis and data mining.However, such schemes need not only big data but also sophisticated processing techniques.This study addresses the aforementioned challenges by proposing a deep learning model with comprehensive data preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning on batch size to achieve abnormal early detection. The necessary data preprocessing is initially conducted besides the conventional data cleaning and normalization steps, and time-series data windowing and label settings are also performed. Then, the imbalanced classes in the records are addressed by adopting an augmentation scheme called the synthetic minority oversampling technique.Principal component analysis is also used to enhance the training. Finally, the proposed deep learning method with fine-tuning is compared with three machine learning models for early anomaly event detection. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can identify potential faults 72 hours before they occur, and the precision rate exceeds 90 %."

The crucial challenge of AIFR arises from the fact that the facial appearance is subject to significant intra-class variations caused by the aging process over time, hence, matching faces with big age gaps is challenging. In this paper, we propose a new coupled network architecture based on the residual learning module for age-invariant face recognition. We implemented the Inception-ResnetV1 (pre-trained on VGGFace2) as the backbone Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). By adding compensation to one of the modalities, the residual learning module reduces Age-Related Modality Discrepancy (ARMD) of which representation can be close to the other modality. The ARMD loss alleviates modal discrepancy by minimizing the cosine distance between different modalities. Experimental results on the cross-age datasets including CACD_VS, FGNET, and General Face Recognition (GFR) dataset indicate that the proposed method can obtain superior performance."

Transformation-based methods learn a mapping of the transformations from an existing input to a target. This makes them ambiguous because in some cases a single input reference may correspond to multiple possible outputs. In this work, we focus on font generation using the generative model-based methods which learn the buildup of the characters from noise-to-image. We propose a novel way to train a conditional generative deep neural model so that we can achieve font style control on the generated font images. Our research demonstrates how to generate new font images conditioned on both character class labels and character style labels when using the generative model-based methods. We achieve this by introducing a modified generator network which is given inputs noise, character class, and style, which help us to calculate losses separately for the character class labels and character style labels. We show that adding the character style vector on top of the character class vector separately gives the model rich information about the font and enables us to explicitly specify not only the character class but also the character style that we want the model to generate."

Wi-Fi access points (APs) built in many construction in advance helps developing a Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) based indoor localization. This localization method first collects pairs of position and RSSI measurement set, which is called fingerprint database, and then estimates a user’s position when given a query measurement set by comparing the fingerprint database. The challenge arises from nonlinearity and noise on Wi-Fi RSSI measurements and complexity of handling a large amount of the fingerprint data. In this paper, machine learning techniques have been applied to implement Wi-Fi based localization. However, most of existing indoor localizations focus on single position estimation. The main contribution of this paper is to develop multi-target localization by using deep neural, which is beneficial when a massive crowd requests positioning service.

Since all the convolution filters can be generated by the linear combinations of the IBFs, the size of a CNN model can be compressed if the number of coefficients for the linear combinations is less than that of filter parameters. Our primary goal is to investigate the possibility of expressing filters with a small set of IBFs by linear combinations.

This is due to the widespread of malicious image tampering. This study presents a new method for image tampering detection and localization that combines the advantages of dilated convolution, residual network, and UNET Architecture. Using the UNET architecture as a backbone, we built the proposed network from two kinds of residual units, one for the encoder path and the other for the decoder path. The residual units help to speed up the training process and facilitate information propagation between the lower layers and the higher layers which are often difficult to train. To capture global image tampering artifacts and reduce the computational burden of the proposed method, we enlarge the receptive field size of the convolutional kernels by adopting dilated convolutions in the residual units used in building the proposed network. In contrast to existing deep learning methods, having a large number of layers, many network parameters, and often difficult to train, the proposed method can achieve excellent performance with a fewer number of parameters and less computational cost. To test the performance of the proposed method, we evaluate its performance in the context of four benchmark image forensics datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods and could be potentially used to enhance image tampering detection and localization."

The Impact of Collective Art Therapy on the LEARNED Lethargy,2021,"['Art Therapy', 'Learned Lethargy', 'Group Counseling', 'Self-Esteem', 'Success Experiences']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Purpose: Since lethargic people express a belief that they are unable to control themselves over some issues and matters, their passivity further elevates, their expectations and motivation for the future fall, and their capaci-ty for performance diminishes. Therefore, it may be viewed that collective art therapy could change negative per-ceptions and behaviors by conducting group interaction and successful experiences in the process of art therapy. This paper seeks to specifically verify the impact on the learned lethargy formed via repeated failures by utilizing the collective art therapy, which is found to be very useful among the various techniques of treatment which might help address internal issues. Method: Uncover the factors of the learned lethargy through references, organizes the concepts, characteristics, and the basic aspects of the factors, and articulate and specify the negative impact on the learned lethargy in detail. Results: The collective art therapy assists one to address issues via deep insights to one’s inner self, encourages one to enhance one’s self-esteem by having a positive self-image, and through interactions by and among the members of group, the process of self-discovery largely contributes to improving one’s self-esteem. It was discov-ered that, by conducting the collective art therapy, group interactions and successful experiences of the art thera-py not only change the negative cognitions and behaviors, but also help achieve a proactive attitude, which is a departure from a depressive behavior studies and a passive attitude. Conclusion: It was discovered that being tamed for the learned lethargy causes a negative impact across vari-ous areas and negative emotions including depression and anxiety. Therefore, through this study, the collective art therapy programs will need to proactively endeavor to ensure that the collective art therapy program delivers a sense of achievement for human growth, convert negative motivations into positive motivations, and that the program is used even more diversely for addressing practical issues."

We tried to apply deep-learning as a method of studying the bodies of solar system. Unlike Earth observation satellite data, the data of solar system differ greatly from celestial bodies to probes and to payloads of each probe. Therefore, it may be difficult to apply it to various data with the deep-learning model, but we expect that it will be able to reduce human errors or compensate for missing parts. We have implemented a model that detects craters on the lunar surface. A model was created using the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) image and the provided shapefile as input values, and applied to the lunar surface image. Although the result was not satisfactory, it will be applied to the image of the permanently shadow regions of the Moon, which is finally acquired by ShadowCam through image pre-processing and model modification. In addition, by attempting to apply it to Ceres and Mercury, which have similar the lunar surface, it is intended to suggest that deep-learning is another method for the study of the solar system."

In downlink NOMA, we consider the co-channel interference that occurs from a base station other than the cell where the user is located, and the user feeds back the signal-to-interference plus noise power ratio (SINR) information instead of channel state information to reduce system feedback overhead. Therefore, the base station controls transmit power using only SINR information. The use of implicit SINR information has the advantage of decreasing the information dimension, but has disadvantage of reducing the data-rate. In this paper, we resolve this problem with deep learning-based training methods and show that the performance of training can be improved if the dimension of deep learning inputs is effectively reduced.

Thus, rapid estimations of the area of lodged rice are necessary to enable timely responses to damage. To this end, we obtained images related to rice lodging using a drone in Gimje, Buan, and Gunsan, which were converted to 128 × 128 pixels images. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model, a deep learning model based on these images, was used to predict rice lodging, which was classified into two types (lodging and non-lodging), and the images were divided in a 8:2 ratio into a training set and a validation set. The CNN model was layered and trained using three optimizers (Adam, Rmsprop, and SGD). The area of rice lodging was evaluated for the three fields using the obtained data, with the exception of the training set and validation set. The images were combined to give composites images of the entire fields using Metashape, and these images were divided into 128 × 128 pixels. Lodging in the divided images was predicted using the trained CNN model, and the extent of lodging was calculated by multiplying the ratio of the total number of field images by the number of lodging images by the area of the entire field. The results for the training and validation sets showed that accuracy increased with a progression in learning and eventually reached a level greater than 0.919. The results obtained for each of the three fields showed high accuracy with respect to all optimizers, among which, Adam showed the highest accuracy (normalized root mean square error: 2.73%).

For many chemicals, there is a lack of information on toxicity. With the current movement toward reducing animal testing, the use of toxicity big data and deep learning could be a promising tool to screen potential toxicants. Objectives: This study identified potential chemicals related to reproductive and estrogen receptor (ER)- mediated toxicities for 1135 cleaning products and 886 laundry products. Methods: We listed chemicals contained in cleaning and laundry products from a publicly available database. Then, chemicals that potentially exhibited reproductive and ER-mediated toxicities were identified using the European Union Classification, Labeling and Packaging classification and ToxCast database, respectively. For chemicals absent from the ToxCast database, ER activity was predicted using deep learning models. Results: Among the 783 listed chemicals, there were 53 with potential reproductive toxicity and 310 with potential ER-mediated toxicity. Among the 473 chemicals not tested with ToxCast assays, deep learning models indicated that 42 chemicals exhibited ER-mediated toxicity. A total of 13 chemicals were identified as causing reproductive toxicity by reacting with the ER. Conclusions: We demonstrated a screening method to identify potential chemicals related to reproductive and ER-mediated toxicities utilizing chemical toxicity big data and deep learning.

As deep learning methods have been popular, the neural network based surface defect detection has been recently introduced. As for the methods, many researchers, in general, adopt a trained neural network, which is mainly winner in the recent ILSVRC (ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge). Then, the weights and last layers are modified to be used for surface defect detection (SDD), which is called transfer learning.

As a result, the nonlinearity of the hydrological system of rivers or basins is increasing, and there is a limitation in that the lead time is insufficient to predict the water level using the existing physical-based hydrological model. This study predicted the water level at Ulsan (Taehwagyo) with a lead time of 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 hours by applying deep learning techniques based on Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and evaluated the prediction accuracy. As a result, DNN model using the sliding window concept showed the highest accuracy with a correlation coefficient of 0.97 and RMSE of 0.82 m.

That point of view has drastically changed on different levels in just a decade. Nowadays cosmetic formulators should unavoidably meet the needs of consumers who want sensory satisfaction, although they do not have much time for new product development. The selection of new products from candidate products largely depend on the panel of human sensory experts. As new product development cycle time decreases, the formulators wanted to find systematic tools that are required to filter candidate products into a short list. Traditional statistical analysis on most physical property tests for the products including tribology tests and rheology tests, do not give any sound foundation for filtering candidate products. In this paper, we suggest a deep learning-based analysis method to identify hand cream products by raw electric signals from tribological sliding test. We compare the result of the deep learning-based method using raw data as input with the results of several machine learning-based analysis methods using manually extracted features as input. Among them, ResNet that is a deep learning model proved to be the best method to identify hand cream used in the test. According to our search in the scientific reported papers, this is the first attempt for predicting test cosmetic product with only raw time-series friction data without any manual feature extraction.

Preparation and response to these water disasters requires national-level planning for water resource management. In addition, watershed-level management of water resources requires flow duration curves (FDC) derived from continuous data based on long-term observations. Traditionally, in water resource studies, physical rainfall-runoff models are widely used to generate duration curves. However, a number of recent studies explored the use of data-based deep learning techniques for runoff prediction. Physical models produce hydraulically and hydrologically reliable results. However, these models require a high level of understanding and may also take longer to operate. On the other hand, data-based deep-learning techniques offer the benefit if less input data requirement and shorter operation time. However, the relationship between input and output data is processed in a black box, making it impossible to consider hydraulic and hydrological characteristics. This study chose one from each category. For the physical model, this study calculated long-term data without missing data using parameter calibration of the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a physical model tested for its applicability in Korea and other countries. The data was used as training data for the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) data-based deep learning technique. An anlysis of the time-series data fond that, during the calibration period (2017-18), the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and the determinanation coefficient for fit comparison were high at 0.04 and 0.03, respectively, indicating that the SWAT results are superior to the LSTM results. In addition, the annual time-series data from the models were sorted in the descending order, and the resulting flow duration curves were compared with the duration curves based on the observed flow, and the NSE for the SWAT and the LSTM models were 0.95 and 0.91, respectively, and the determination coefficients were 0.96 and 0.92, respectively. The findings indicate that both models yield good performance. Even though the LSTM requires improved simulation accuracy in the low flow sections, the LSTM appears to be widely applicable to calculating flow duration curves for large basins that require longer time for model development and operation due to vast data input, and non-measured basins with insufficient input data."

In this study, we propose hybrid allreduce strategy that considers the characteristics of each layer and communication and computational overlapping technique for synchronization of distributed deep learning. Since the convolution layer has fewer parameters than the fully-connected layer as well as it is located at the upper, only short overlapping time is allowed. Thus, butterfly allreduce is used to synchronize the convolution layer. On the other hand, fully-connecter layer is synchronized using ring all-reduce. The empirical experiment results on PyTorch with our proposed scheme shows that the proposed method reduced the training time by up to 33% compared to the baseline PyTorch."

Furthermore, we reduced down-sampling operations in the encoder to reduce the loss of spatial information included in the feature maps. The proposed method showed an improved segmentation result of about 12% compared to the conventional U-Net in the Cityscapes dataset experiment."

The use of synthetic training data has many advantages; Securing massive data for training becomes easy and generating exact fault labels is possible with the help of synthetic training data. To interpret real data with the model trained by synthetic data, the synthetic data used for training should be geologically realistic. In this study, we introduce a method to generate realistic synthetic seismic data. Initially, reflectivity models are generated to include realistic fault structures, and then, a one-way wave equation is applied to efficiently generate seismic stack sections. Next, a migration algorithm is used to remove diffraction artifacts and random noise is added to mimic actual field data. A convolutional neural network model based on the U-Net structure is used to verify the generated synthetic data set. From the results of the experiment, we confirm that realistic synthetic data effectively creates a deep learning model that can be applied to field data."

It was attempted to provide a more detailed understanding about the possibility of future changes in North Korea by tracking changes in North Korea’s perceptions of South Korea and its perceptions of peace and threats. As a result, the main threat was the US for North Korea’s perspective, and it was also confirmed that South Korea could be perceived as a threat by insulting on the dignity of the supreme leader-Kim Jongeun. The fact whether South Korea’s governments consist of progressive or conservative party doesn’t seem to have significant impacts on North Korea’s perception. Expectations for improvement in inter-Korean relations in 2018 are highly likely to have been perceived by North Korea as an escape from the crisis through the ease of economic sanctions.

In particular, the performance of CNN algorithms has reached the level of self-adjusting the source data itself. However, the existing image processing method only deals with the image data itself, and does not sufficiently consider the heterogeneous environment in which the image is generated. Images generated in a heterogeneous environment may have the same information, but their features may be expressed differently depending on the photographing environment. This means that not only the different environmental information of each image but also the same information are represented by different features, which may degrade the performance of the image analysis model. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method to improve the performance of the image color constancy model based on Adversarial Learning that uses image data generated in a heterogeneous environment simultaneously. Specifically, the proposed methodology operates with the interaction of the ‘Domain Discriminator’ that predicts the environment in which the image was taken and the ‘Illumination Estimator’ that predicts the lighting value.

This study aims to forecast the water level of the nearest station to the dam multi-timestep-ahead and evaluate the availability when it makes a decision for a release discharge of dam based on LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) of deep learning. The LSTM model was trained and tested on eight data sets with a 1-hour temporal resolution, including primary data used in the dam operation and downstream water level station data about 13 years (2009~2021). The trained model forecasted the water level time series divided by the six lead times: 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18-hours, and compared and analyzed with the observed data. As a result, the prediction results of the 1-hour ahead exhibited the best performance for all cases with an average accuracy of MAE of 0.01m, RMSE of 0.015 m, and NSE of 0.99, respectively. In addition, as the lead time increases, the predictive performance of the model tends to decrease slightly. The model may similarly estimate and reliably predicts the temporal pattern of the observed water level. Thus, it is judged that the LSTM model could produce predictive data by extracting the characteristics of complex hydrological non-linear data and can be used to determine the amount of release discharge from the dam when simulating the operation of the dam."

The low recall compared to precision is due to the underestimation of compost pixels when there is a small proportion of compost pixels at the edges of the image. After, It seems that accuracy can be improved by combining additional data sets with additional bands other than the RGB band."

It has been especially used in the area of natural language processing, with some word-representation vectors playing a critical role. However, some of the low-resource languages, such as Swahili, which is spoken in East and Central Africa, do not fall into this category. Natural Language Processing is a field of artificial intelligence where systems and computational algorithms are built that can automatically understand, analyze, manipulate, and potentially generate human language. After coming to discover that some African languages fail to have a proper representation within language processing, even going so far as to describe them as lower resource languages because of inadequate data for NLP, we decided to study the Swahili language. As it stands currently, language modeling using neural networks requires adequate data to guarantee quality word representation, which is important for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Most African languages have no data for such processing. The main aim of this project is to recognize and focus on the classification of words in English, Swahili, and Korean with a particular emphasis on the low-resource Swahili language. Finally, we are going to create our own dataset and reprocess the data using Python Script, formulate the syllabic alphabet, and finally develop an English, Swahili, and Korean word analogy dataset."

These methods generate noise and use as train and data set. This has limitation in that it is difficult to accurately measure performance because it is unlikely that noise other than the noise used for learning is included in the test set In addition, there is no practical error type standard, so the type of error used in each study is different, making qualitative analysis difficult. This paper proposes new 'error type classification' for deep learning-based Korean spelling correction research, and error analysis perform on existing commercialized Korean spelling correctors (System A, B, C). As a result of analysis, it was found the three correction systems did not perform well in correcting other error types presented in this paper other than spacing, and hardly recognized errors in word order or tense."

The most widely used methods for validating a deep learning model include a holdout verification method, a k-fold cross verification method, and a bootstrap method. These legacy methods consider the balance of the ratio between classes in the process of dividing the data set, but do not consider the ratio of various features that exist within the same class. If these features are not considered, verification results may be biased toward some features. Therefore, we propose a deep learning model validation method based on data feature coverage for image classification by improving the legacy methods. The proposed technique proposes a data feature coverage that can be measured numerically how much the training data set for training and validation of the deep learning model and the evaluation data set reflects the features of the entire data set. In this method, the data set can be divided by ensuring coverage to include all features of the entire data set, and the evaluation result of the model can be analyzed in units of feature clusters. As a result, by providing feature cluster information for the evaluation result of the trained model, feature information of data that affects the trained model can be provided."

This approach, however, cannot use memory efficiently and causes loses of essential information on objects. Thus, various approaches that can directly apply deep learning architecture to non-Euclidean 3D data have emerged.

And artificial intelligence, ‘classification’ is often used regardless of life and research. Classification is used in many parts of everyday life, and classification is a very important methodology in literary research. Thus, this study attempted to analyze the Sijo by combining deep learning of artificial intelligence with the methodology of classification.Using a deep learning classification algorithm, 299 and 290 works of Yeongnam and Honam were trained, and 4,736 works of the “Korean Sijo Dictionary” were classified in earnest. As a result, 3,758 works (79.4%) were closely related to the two bands. This shows the status of the two bands in the history of Sijo literature. According to deep learning analysis of 299 works by artists from Yeongnam Gadan and 290 works by artists from Honam Gadan, 281 works for the former and 229 works for the latter were highly related to each band. This confirmed the potential for deep learning to be utilized in the Sijo study.On the other hand, although the frequency was not high, the 7th number of Yeongnam Gadan and 35th number of Honam Gadan were the opposite. This reflects differences in the relationship and creative environment of authors not included in the deep learning classification algorithm, which is a meaningful conclusion in that it suggests that external factors as well as internal characteristics of the work should be considered. Other writers who did not belong to any of the two bands were also able to be understood as a result of a combination of the writer’s life, friendship, and entering and leaving office.This study still remains level of attempt that examines classical literature as a new methodology called artificial intelligence.

In general, spatial data is analyzed by kriging method as follow stages: (1) Estimating an empirical variogram, (2) Fitting a theoretical variogram using the estimated empirical variogram, (3) Predicting the value in the unknown location using the observations from the known location with the fitted theoretical variogram. Deep learning, one of the artificial intelligence techniques that have recently become an issue, is also widely applied as a way of prediction. Although both methods are similar in terms of making predictions, not only can the subject of the analyst be involved in the method of predicting through the analysis process of kriging method, but the analysis process is not very simple. However, deep learning can be complex to design, but it has the advantage of being much simpler to use than analytical methods conducted in kriging method. In this work, we use both methods to conduct our analysis and to find out which methods are superior in terms of more spatial predictive aspects. The RMSE was used as the criteria for prediction performance. The result of the prediction comparison showed that kriging method and deep learning have similar power for spatial prediction.

These circumstances indirectly inflict negative effects on the farmer income and the development of watermelon seed company. Therefore, seed purity is a prerequisite for all seed breeders and companies, as the performance of a given seed variety can be known and standardized from the rest. In this study we employed color camera techniques to discriminate triploid watermelon seeds from diploid and tetraploid seeds nondestructively. Seed-ploid images were acquired by both a digital canon and mvBlue fox3 USB3.0 camera and discrimination models constructed with multivariate machine learning methods of one class classification with DD-SIMCA and SVM quadratic. And to improve the accuracy obtained, a deep learning model was also developed. The models constructed on one class classification with DD-SIMCA, and SVM-quadratic method yielded triploid discrimination accuracy of 69.5% and 85.5% respectively when a digital canon camera was used. To further improve the class-ploid discrimination accuracy, a deep learning model of deeplabv3+ and Resnet18, gave an accuracy of 95.5%. Deep learning model results demonstrated a higher discrimination accuracy and thus these results can be potentially automated and applied on online system for real time seed-ploid discrimination and sorting."

In order to automate construction site management, it is necessary to recognize objects such as construction equipment or workers, and automatically analyze the relationship between them. For example, if the relationship between workers and construction equipment at a construction site can be known, various use cases of site management such as work productivity, equipment operation status monitoring, and safety management can be implemented. This study derives a real-time object detection platform architecture that is required when performing construction site management using deep learning technology, which has recently been increasingly used. To this end, deep learning models that support real-time object detection are investigated and analyzed. Based on this, a deep learning model development process required for real-time construction site object detection is defined.

Recently, the machine learning based approach is being actively conducted for improving recognition accuracy. In this approach, a deep neural network is trained using a sound dataset, and then the actual sound is applied to identify the sound category. In the identification stage, the recognition accuracy of the machine learning is degraded due to the ambient noise. In other words, unlike the experimental environment, various sounds are input into the microphone along with the target sound. Since these ambient sounds are not trained, they could lower the classification performance. However, there are only a few research results on the relation between the noise and the recognition performance despite of the practical importance. In this paper, we study the performance degradation of sound classification in the space where the music is playing with considering the music genre and the volume level. For this, we use CNN, UrbanSound8K dataset consisting of 10 kinds of environmental sounds, and GTZAN data set containing 10 kinds of music genres. First, CNN is trained to recognize the sounds of UrbanSound8K, and then five songs for each genre were selected from GTZAN and mixed to the UrbanSound8K so that the signal-to-noise ratio are -20dB, 0dB, 5dB, 10dB, and 20dB. Then we test the accuracy with the mixed sound input and compare with the noise-free target sound. As a result, there is 2.8% to 22% difference in the recognition accuracy by music genre and sound level. The result show that the SNR should be 20dB or more in order for music not to have a significant effect on the recognition accuracy."

However, as algae are living organisms, it is difficult to predict according to physical dynamics, and not easy to consider the effects of numerous factors such as weather, hydraulic, hydrology, and water quality. Therefore, a lot of researches on algal bloom prediction using machine learning have been recently conducted. In this study, the characteristic importance of water quality factors affecting the occurrence of Cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) were analyzed using the random forest (RF) model for Bohyeonsan Dam and Yeongcheon Dam located in Yeongcheon-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do and also predicted the occurrence of harmful blue-green algae using the machine learning and deep learning models and evaluated their accuracy. The water temperature and total nitrogen (T-N) were found to be high in common, and the occurrence prediction of CyanoHABs using artificial neural network (ANN) also predicted the actual values closely, confirming that it can be used for the reservoirs that require the prediction of harmful cyanobacteria for algal management in the future."

딥러닝과 데이터마이닝에 있어서의 데이터베이스권의 범위와 제한에 관한 고찰,2021,"['저작권', '인공지능', '딥러닝', '데이터마이닝', '공정이용', '데이터베이스', 'copyright', 'artificial intelligence', 'deep learning', 'data mining', 'fair use', 'database']","딥러닝과 데이터마이닝이 일정한 분야에서 괄목할 만한 성과를 내면서 인류에게새로운 미래를 가져 올 기술로 각광받고 있다. 그러나 딥러닝과 데이터마이닝을 위해서는 대량의 데이터를 복제하는 과정이 필수적이므로 저작권법과의 충돌을 피하기어렵다. 이에 따라 기술의 발전을 위축시키지 않도록 저작권법 상의 권리를 제한해야 한다는 논의가 활발히 진행되고 있다. 이러한 논의에서 주의할 점은, 기술 발전이라는 정책적 목표는 권리자의 보호와 이용자의 이익 사이의 균형을 전제로 하여야 한다는 것이다. 현재의 균형 상태에 대한 분석과 검증 없이 정책적 목적만을 기준으로 하여서는 균형 잡힌 해석을 도출하기 어렵고, 그때 그때의 사정에 따라 균형의 중심을 옮겨법적 혼란만 가중하게 되기 쉽다. 본고에서 주로 살펴 볼 데이터베이스는 저작물과 달리 창작성을 보호 요건으로 하지 않지만, 그 대신 소재의 배열·구성을 통해 접근·검색 가능성을 제공할 것을 요건으로 한다. 이는 저작권법의 데이터베이스 관련 규정의 해석에 있어 구심점이 되어야 하며, 이를 통하여 문언에 충실하면서도 저작물에 관한 표현-아이디어 이분법의원칙과 일관된 해석론을 도출할 수 있다. 이러한 해석에 의할 때, 저작물의 표현이 아닌 아이디어만을 차용하는 행위가 복제에 해당하지 않는 것과 마찬가지로 데이터베이스의 복제 행위(저작권법 제93조 제1항)는 그 대상이 되는 데이터베이스의 배열·구성을 일부나마 포함하고 있어야 하고, 소재의 체계적·반복적 복제 행위(동조 제2 항 단서)는 원래의 데이터베이스와 최소한 부분적으로 동등한 접근·검색 가능성을제공하여야 비로소 데이터베이스의 통상적인 이용과 충돌하거나 데이터베이스제작자의 이익을 부당하게 침해하는 것이라 평가할 수 있을 것이다. 이러한 해석론에 의하면, 딥러닝 및 데이터마이닝을 위한 데이터의 수집 행위는 애초에 데이터베이스제작자의 권리에 저촉되지 않거나, 공정이용의 법리에 의해 권리 침해를 구성하지 않는경우가 많을 것으로 보인다. 이러한 해석론을 구체화한 권리 제한 규정을 도입함으로써 불확실성을 감소시키는것은 의미 있는 일이다. 실제로 여러 국가에서 이러한 시도가 이루어지고 있으나, 유럽은 관련 유럽위원회 지침 상 회원국이 권리 제한 규정을 둘 수 있는 요건이 경직되어 있다가 최근에서야 완화되었으므로 우리나라의 상황에서 참고할 만한 입법례는아직 보이지 않는다. 일본은 그에 비하여 훨씬 발전된 권리 제한 규정을 두고 있고, 최근 우리나라의 저작권법전부개정법률안(도종환 의원 대표발의, 의안번호 2107440) 도 이에 영향을 받은 것으로 보인다. 그러나 위 법률안은 몇 가지 문제점을 안고 있어개정의 목적을 달성할 수 있는지 의문이 있다. 새로운 권리 제한 규정은 저작물에 대해서는 표현을 중심으로, 데이터베이스권에 대해서는 배열·구성과 이를 통한 접근·검색 가능성을 중심으로 보다 명확한 요건을 두어야 할 것이다","As deep learning and data mining show astonishing achievements in certain areas, they are expected to open a bright future that we never anticipated before. However, they will probably conflict with the Copyright Act as copying of massive data is inevitable to implement these new technologies. There have been voices that the rights under the Copyright Act should be restricted to avoid chilling effects on these new technologies. Such arguments seemingly overlook that the policy of technological advancement should have a firm ground on the balance between the exclusive rights and the interest of the public in using the works. Without careful study and verification of the current balance, driving technological advancement would hardly lead to a well-balanced reading of the statutes. It would more likely bring more confusion by shifting the equilibrium as the need arises. Sui generis database rights, which are the main subject of this paper, do not require creativity as copyrights to works of authorship do. Instead, databases must have an arrangement or structure that enables access and search of individual data. This characteristic of databases must be the core in understanding the statutory provisions to derive a logical and robust interpretation that is faithful to the language and consistent with the idea-expression dichotomy prevailing throughout the Copyright Act. After an analysis based on the proposition above, this paper suggests that a “reproduction of a database” under Article 93(1) of the Copyright Act must include at least a part of the arrangement or structure in the original database, as copying a work of authorship requires copying the expression in the original work. In addition, a “systematic and repetitive reproduction of individual data” should enable access and search that is at least partially equivalent to those provided by the original database to “conflict with the ordinary use of the database” or to “unfairly infringe on the interest to the database” as stipulated in Article 93(2) of the Copyright Act. According to the interpretation suggested above, collecting data for deep learning and data mining in most cases would not be subject to the database rights or exempted under the law of fair use. That said, introducing new statutory provisions that incorporate the discussion in this paper is still relevant as they would reduce ambiguities. The Database Directive (96/9/EC) has been maintaining relatively narrow requirements for restriction of rights until amended by the Digital Single Market Directive (Directive (EU) 2019/790) recently. As a result, we do not yet see any amendments in European countries noteworthy for the legal situation in South Korea. Japanese Copyright Act has more advanced provisions restricting copyrights to allow new technologies such as deep learning and data mining, which apparently influenced the bill for the amendment of the Copyright Act in South Korea. However, the bill does not seem to address the issues properly to achieve the desired outcome. The new provisions should have clearer requirements that are formed around the ‘expression’ for works of authorship and the ‘arrangement or structure’ that enables ‘access and search’ for databases."

There is an increased need for information regarding agricultural water management to respond to the changes in the agricultural environment and climate. Therefore;automatic water level measurement facilities have been introduced to determine the real-time reservoir storage capacity and agricultural water supply.

CXR were analyzed using the commercial artificial intelligence product that provides free online DL algorithms to the public for COVID-19. Computerized tomography was used as the standard reference. Performance of the DL algorithm was evaluated by the sensitivity and specificity, and results were compared to the CXR records of emergency physicians (EP) in charge of the actual screening triage clinic during the COVID-19 epidemic.Results: Totally, 114 patients were evaluated, of which 38 patients were positive for COVID-19. In 85 CXRs examined (36 COVID-19 and 49 non-COVID-19) with findings of pneumonia in computerized tomography, the DL algorithm showed significantly higher sensitivity as compared to the EP (DL, 98.8% [93.6%-99.9%] vs. EP, 85.9% [76.6%-92.5%]; P<0.01). Moreover, the DL algorithm showed significantly higher sensitivity for detecting CXRs with COVID-19 pneumonia, as compared to the EP (DL, 100.0% [90.3%-100%] vs. EP, 91.7% [77.5%-98.3%]; P=0.08).Conclusion: We conclude that for examining the CXR of patients with suspected COVID-19, sensitivity of the DL algorithm is superior than the EP for detecting lesions suggesting pneumonia. Thus, the application of the DL algorithm is potentially useful in screening triage clinics to detect COVID-19 pneumonia"

However, as the BIM modeling process is performed by a large number of participants, it is difficult to achieve complete integrity. To solve this problem, studies on semantic integrity verification are being conducted to examine whether elements are correctly classified or IFC mapped in the BIM model by applying an artificial intelligence algorithm to the 2D image of each element. Existing studies had a limitation in that they could not correctly classify some elements even though the geometrical differences in the images were clear. This was found to be due to the fact that the geometrical characteristics were not properly reflected in the learning process because the range of the region to be learned in the image was not clearly defined. In this study, the CRF-RNN-based semantic segmentation was applied to increase the clarity of element region within each image, and then applied to the MVCNN algorithm to improve the classification performance. As a result of applying semantic segmentation in the MVCNN learning process to 889 data composed of a total of 8 BIM element types, the classification accuracy was found to be 0.92, which is improved by 0.06 compared to the conventional MVCNN."

This study aimed to examine the UHI effect by urban structure in Suwon and Daegu using the LCZ scheme. First, the LCZ maps were generated using Landsat 8 images and convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning over the two cities. Then, Surface UHI (SUHI), which indicates the land surface temperature (LST) difference between urban and rural areas, was analyzed by LCZ class. The results showed that the overall accuracies of the CNN models for LCZ classification were relatively high 87.9% and 81.7% for Suwon and Daegu, respectively. In general, Daegu had higher LST for all LCZ classes than Suwon. For both cities, LST tended to increase with increasing building density with relatively low building height. For both cities, the intensity of SUHI was very high in summer regardless of LCZ classes and was also relatively high except for a few classes in spring and fall. In winter the SUHI intensity was low, resulting in negative values for many LCZ classes. This implies that UHI is very strong in summer, and some urban areas often are colder than rural areas in winter. The research findings demonstrated the applicability of the LCZ data for SUHI analysis and can provide a basis for establishing timely strategies to respond urban on-going climate change over urban areas."

The green coverage ratio is calculated based on the land cover map, but low spatial resolution and inconsistent production cycle of land cover map make it difficult to calculate the correct green coverage area and analyze the precise green coverage. Therefore, this study proposes a new method to calculate green coverage area using aerial images and deep neural networks. Green coverage ratio can be quickly calculated using manned aerial images acquired by local governments, but precise analysis is difficult because components of image such as acquisition date, resolution, and sensors cannot be selected and modified. This limitation can be supplemented by using an unmanned aerial vehicle that can mount various sensors and acquire high-resolution images due to low-altitude flight. In this study, we proposed a method to calculate green coverage ratio from manned or unmanned aerial images, and experimentally verified the proposed method. Aerial images enable precise analysis by high resolution and relatively constant cycles, and deep learning can automatically detect green coverage area in aerial images. Local governments acquire manned aerial images for various purposes every year and we can utilize them to calculate green coverage ratio quickly. However, acquired manned aerial images may be difficult to accurately analyze because details such as acquisition date, resolution, and sensors cannot be selected. These limitations can be supplemented by using unmanned aerial vehicles that can mount various sensors and acquire high-resolution images due to low-altitude flight. Accordingly, the green coverage ratio was calculated from the two aerial images, and as a result, it could be calculated with high accuracy from all green types. However, the green coverage ratio calculated from manned aerial images had limitations in complex environments.

Therefore, drone image-based remote sensing is different from traditional remote sensing in terms of the level of object to be extracted from the image and the amount of data to be processed. In addition, the optimal scale and size of data used for model training is different depending on the characteristics of the applied deep learning model. However, most studies do not consider the size of the object to be found in the image, the spatial resolution of the image that reflects the scale, and in many cases, the data specification used in the model is applied as it is before. In this study, the effect of spatial resolution and image size of drone image on the accuracy and training time of the semantic segmentation deep learning model of six wintering vegetables was quantitatively analyzed through experiments. As a result of the experiment, it was found that the average accuracy of dividing six wintering vegetables increases as the spatial resolution increases, but the increase rate and convergence section are different for each crop, and there is a big difference in accuracy and time depending on the size of the image at the same resolution. In particular, it was found that the optimal resolution and image size were different from each crop. The research results can be utilized as data for getting the efficiency of drone images acquisition and production of training data when developing a winter vegetable segmentation model using drone images."

딥러닝 기반 거리 영상의 Semantic Segmentation을 위한 Atrous Residual U-Net,2021,['-'],국문 초록 정보 없음,"In this paper, we proposed an Atrous Residual U-Net (AR-UNet) to improve the segmentation accuracy of semantic segmentation method based on U-Net. The U-Net is mainly used in fields such as medical image analysis, autonomous vehicles, and remote sensing images. The conventional U-Net lacks extracted features due to the small number of convolution layers in the encoder part. The extracted features are essential for classifying object categories, and if they are insufficient, it causes a problem of lowering the segmentation accuracy. Therefore, to improve this problem, we proposed the AR-UNet using residual learning and ASPP in the encoder. Residual learning improves feature extraction ability and is effective in preventing feature loss and vanishing gradient problems caused by continuous convolutions. In addition, ASPP enables additional feature extraction without reducing the resolution of the feature map. Experiments verified the effectiveness of the AR-UNet with Cityscapes dataset. The experimental results showed that the AR-UNet showed improved segmentation results compared to the conventional U-Net. In this way, AR-UNet can contribute to the advancement of many applications where accuracy is important."

There are two types of learning strategies: surface learning and deep learning. This study aims to investigate the direct effect of learning strategies on adaptive performance and the effects of positive psychological capital and organizational justice on the relationship between learning strategies and adaptive performance. Questionnaires were given to employees and their bosses at two intervals six months apart. A total of 793 pairs of questionnaires were used for hypothesis testing. The results of the survey are as follows. First, both surface learning and deep learning strategies had direct and positive effects on adaptive performance. Second, surface learning strategies had a negative effect on positive psychological capital, while deep learning strategies had a positive effect on positive psychological capital. Third, positive psychological capital had a positive effect on adaptive performance. Fourth, the mediation effect of positive psychological capital in the relationship between deep learning and adaptive performance was positively significant. Contrary to expectations, positive psychological capital also showed a positive mediation effect in the relationship between surface learning and adaptive performance. Fifth, the results of the moderation effects showed that distributive justice mitigated the negative relationship between surface learning and positive psychological capital, while it strengthened the positive relationship between deep learning and positive psychological capital. Finally, the conditional indirect effects had significant impacts on the relationship between the two types of learning strategies and adaptive performance."

The results showed that the students experienced various difficulties in the process of performing flipped learning, parents support patterns and levels of support for their children s flipped learning differed depending on parenting attitudes and the number of children. The difficulties that parents faced in the process of supporting their children s flipped learning were summarized as difficulties in accessing information, differences in perception between children and parents about the fidelity of learning or tasks, time constraints, and difficulties in families with multiple children. Parents evaluated the flipped learning positively in general but they suggested room for improvement in flipped learning from various aspects. Based on the above results, the last part of the study looked into the parts to consider in the process of planning and implementing flipped learning at school and the topics of academic discussion necessary for the improvement of flipped learning."

Such a complex and deep neural network structure can cause over-fitting problems. In order to avoid over-fitting, a weight decay regularization method of parameters is used.

Such interpretation of the hexagrams of Qian and Kun provides a core foundation for Zhouyi philosophy as the way of self-cultivation of the virtuous man where he learns what Dao(道) and De(德) are from Heaven and Earth and practices what was learned.In Zhouyi philosophy, what the virtuous man should learn and put into practice is to carefully observe and get an insight into the constant changes occurring in Heaven and Earth and notice a harbinger of those changes(機微). The changes of Heaven and Earth do not merely refer to the changes in nature, they also include the changes in all human affairs that realize De by learning and practicing Dao of Heaven and Earth. We, living in the modern era, as well as the virtuous man, should be fearful and cultivate ourselves to spot the moments of change even in difficult times with Zhouyi philosophy in order not to regret or be ashamed of missing those moments. Zhouyi philosophy leads individuals or groups of people within a specific situation and context to explore and make decisions on the basis of one’s life and existence or specific relationships in a reflective way in the process of understanding hexagrams(卦) and lines(爻). We always need to perceive the exact time(時中) and the harbinger of changes(機微) to have a firm and clear understanding of the reality of these temporary and momentary beings and have a deep insight into ‘the circulation of life without a complete extinction(生生)’ which would always remain constant amid those changes. This is the wisdom and the middle path that we should learn from Heaven and Earth.To practice self-cultivation to maintain the state of being moderate[中] where we are not swayed by personal bias or obstinacy, or constantly changing emotions through 64 hexagrams(卦) and 384 lines(爻) of Zhouyi is the key of the book Daxiangzhuan."

The subjects of this study were Korean adults who had completed voice recording and BMI measurement in 2006-2015 among the data established at the Korean Medicine Data Center. Among them, 2,825 data were used for training to build the model, and 566 data were used to assess the performance of the model. As an input feature of CNN, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) extracted from vowel utterances was used. A model was constructed to predict a total of four groups according to gender and BMI criteria: overweight male, normal male, overweight female, and normal female. Results & Conclusions Performance evaluation was conducted using F1-score and Accuracy. As a result of the prediction for four groups, The average accuracy was 0.6016, and the average F1-score was 0.5922. Although it showed good performance in gender discrimination, it is judged that performance improvement through follow-up studies is necessary for distinguishing BMI within gender.

We prepared four combinations of alloys, Al-6wt%Si, Al-9wt%Si, Al-12wt%Si and Al-15wt%Si for machine learning. DCGAN is composed of a generator and a discriminator. The discriminator has a typical convolutional neural network (CNN), and the generator has an inverse shaped CNN. The fake images generated using DCGAN were similar to real microstructural images. However, they showed some strange morphology, including dendrites without directionality, and deformed Si crystals. Verification with Inception V3 revealed that the fake images generated using DCGAN were well classified into the target categories. Even the visually imperfect images in the initial training iterations showed high similarity to the target. It seems that the imperfect images had enough microstructural characteristics to satisfy the classification, even though human cannot recognize the images. Cross validation was carried out using real, fake and other test images.When the training dataset had the fake images only, the real and test images showed high similarities to the target categories. When the training dataset contained both the real and fake images, the similarity at the target categories were high enough to meet the right answers. We concluded that the DCGAN developed for microstructural images in this study is highly useful for data augmentation for rare microstructures."

Cell morphology, which reflects the physiological state of the cell, can be used to track the temporal behavior of cancer cells conveniently. Here, we first present a hybrid learning-based platform that extracts cell morphology in a time-dependent manner using a deep convolutional neural network to incorporate multivariate data. Feature selection from more than 200 morphological features is conducted, which filters out less significant variables to enhance interpretation. Our platform then performs unsupervised clustering to unveil dynamic behavior patterns hidden from a high-dimensional dataset. As a result, we visualize morphology state-space by two-dimensional embedding as well as representative morphology clusters and trajectories. This cell morphology profiling strategy by hybrid learning enables simplification of the heterogeneous population of cancer."

Developers face difficulties when choosing among these networks because sufficient information on their performance is unavailable. To alleviate this difficulty, we evaluated the performance of each algorithm by comparing their errors and processing times. Each neural network model was trained using a tax dataset, and the trained model was used for data prediction to compare accuracies among the various algorithms. Furthermore, the effects of activation functions and various optimizers on the performance of the models were analyzed The experimental results show that the GRU and LSTM algorithms yields the lowest prediction error with an average RMSE of 0.12 and an average R2 score of 0.78 and 0.75 respectively, and the basic DNN model achieves the lowest processing time but highest average RMSE of 0.163.

Firms threatened by uncertainties in terms of future survival eagerly pursue and seek organizational learning not only within their organizations but also across organizational boundaries. In this light, implementing the right strategies for organizational learning is considered to be one of effective ways to ensure firms’ competitive advantages and future survival; however, when and how newly-established high-technology firms should adopt and deploy these learning strategies have not been clarified yet. In the present study, the authors attempt to theorize the organizational learning strategies for newly-established high-technology firms by focusing on the process of knowledge flows across organizational boundaries as well as within their own organizations. Specifically, to analyze what types of employees should be allocated or what types of organizations should be chosen for cooperations along organizational development stages, we examine how new high-technology firms implement two different learning strategies, exploration and exploitation, by drawing on resource-based view, human capital theory, and transaction cost economics. Then, considering the current situation that new high-technology firms are actively participating in cooperations with the existing great firms for mutual learning, we extend the existing organizational learning strategies with social network perspective. As a result, we propose an integrated model for organizational learning strategies and provide a representative evidence in the high-technology industry: KAI (Korea Aerospace Industries, Ltd.). Particularly, looking deep in the company history, we believe that our integrated model will verify that new high-technology firms develop competitive advantages by adopting different organizational learning strategies to different types of employees and firms."

Abnormal vessel movement can be defined as an unreasonable movement deviation from the usual trajectory, speed, or other traffic parameters. Detection of the abnormal vessel movement requires the operators not only to pay short-term attention but also to have long-term trajectory trace ability. Recent advances in deep learning have shown the potential of deep learning techniques to discover hidden and more complex relations that often lie in low dimensional latent spaces. In this paper, we propose a deep autoencoder-based clustering model for automatic detection of vessel movement anomaly to assist monitoring operators to take actions on the vessel for more investigation. We first generate gridded trajectory images by mapping the raw vessel trajectories into two dimensional matrix. Based on the gridded image input, we test the proposed model along with the other deep autoencoder-based models for the abnormal trajectory data generated through rotation and speed variation from normal trajectories. We show that the proposed model improves detection accuracy for the generated abnormal trajectories compared to the other models."

Collision identification is far more difficult compared to collision detection, because sensor data are highly correlated when collisions occur at close locations. To improve the identification accuracy, this paper proposes an auxiliary loss, which is called consistency loss. This auxiliary loss guides the training of a deep neural network to predict consistent predictions for each single collision event. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

The Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance (PAD) temperament model was employed to classify the users’ emotional state. The prediction model was designed to consist of 10 hidden layers and 378 nodes each, and the accuracy was 96.23% (pleasure), 96.98% (arousal), and 96.47% (dominance) using 3,740,000 training data. In this experiment, twelve adults experienced a virtual reality teaching simulation and their EEG data were collected using Emotiv EPOC+. The EEG data was applied to the developed prediction model to decide the users’ emotional state. The participants’ emotional state was classified by visualizing a time series graph and a 3D scatter plot. Results showed that the users’ emotional state converged into two categories, unsatisfied and helpless. It indicates that it is possible to judge users’ emotional state through the prediction model.

In particular, current urban networks, in which the fixed-time traffic signal control system is dominant, can not reflect the real-time traffic situation in the signaling system. Even if the autonomous vehicle is commercialized, it could not exhibit its performance. At this time, if the artificial intelligence traffic signal control system based on accurate real-time vehicle information obtained through V2I technology is developed, more efficient traffic signal control will be possible and it will affect not only traffic flow but also the performance of the V2X technology-equipped vehicles. Especially, when there is unnecessary waiting time for the emergency vehicle in the urban intersection, it may affect the travel time to reach the destination. In case of driving while leaving the lane for the purpose of shortening the travel time, it can threaten the safety of a patient and surrounding vehicles. At this point, if the traffic signal control system that detects the entrance of the emergency vehicle to an intersection through the V2I technology and gives the priority signal to the emergency vehicle is developed, the safer emergency vehicle operation could be guaranteed. In this paper, the change of traffic flow according to the change of traffic signal control system is analyzed based on micro traffic information at single signalized intersection with V2I technology commercialization. A reinforcement learning model that expresses the optimum signal in real-time by learning the traffic information at the single signalized intersection was constructed based on the deep learning through the tensor flow. The performance of the developed traffic signal control system was verified through Vissim. The developed reinforcement learning model expresses a specific signal phase through real-time traffic information and expresses appropriate signal display in the changed network situation. The traffic signal control system developed in this paper is expected to contribute to achieve system optimization in a complex road network and to contribute to the analysis of traffic flow. In addition, it will contribute to building a smart city when autonomous vehicles are operated in the future V2X environment."

However, deep neural networks that depend on training data have the potential to overfit text information instead of learning the speaker information when repeatedly learning from the identical time series. In this paper, to prevent the overfitting, we propose a segment unit shuffling layer that divides and rearranges the input layer or a hidden layer along the time axis, thus mixes the time series information. Since the segment unit shuffling layer can be applied not only to the input layer but also to the hidden layers, it can be used as generalization technique in the hidden layer, which is known to be effective compared to the generalization technique in the input layer, and can be applied simultaneously with data augmentation. In addition, the degree of distortion can be adjusted by adjusting the unit size of the segment. We observe that the performance of text-independent speaker verification is improved compared to the baseline when the proposed segment unit shuffling layer is applied."

This research started from the question “Can we find optimal solutions through learning?,” and suggests the direction to solve optimization problems using machine learning. To this end, this paper proposes three ways to solve the 8-puzzle problem, which is a representative optimization problem, by using deep reinforcement learning. The first is learning optimal actions for all states, and the second is learning a heuristic function for A* search. Finally, the third one learns an optimal path from a specific state to the goal state. All three types of learning are preformed based on deep Q-learning, a representative deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Experimental results show that learning optimal actions for all states seems not easy. However, it was confirmed that not only learning a heuristic function for A* search but also learning an optimal path from a specific state to the goal state is very effective for solving the 8-puzzle problem."

Also, this data can be used for gait classification to control the prosthesis. However, in real-time control, the number of the gait dynamics data counted by the sensor is only measured to the level that the deep learning model is difficult to learn., In this study, the most efficient deep learning model case was developed to resolve this problem in the case of a real-time control situation where data measurement time is insufficient. The data is collected through a hall sensor, load cell and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) mounted on the above-knee prosthesis. Subsequently, the collected data is divided into 5 phases (Loading Response (LR), Mid Stance (MS), Push Off (PO), Early Swing (ES), and Late Swing (LS)) of the gait cycle according to the point of inflection of hall sensors and load cells. Afterward, training data of the deep learning were generated by sliding window algorithm and the treated data was exercised on four deep learning models by changing the value of width and depth configurations. The results are assessed on accuracy, loss and F1-Score. In conclusion, the loss function statistically decreased in the case of the values of width and depth of the deep learning model were low. Accuracy and F1-Score were not shown significant difference statistically. Therefore, the results provided an efficient deep learning model for above-knee prosthesis to gait analysis and expected to lead to a more reasonable gait model for the control of the above-knee prosthesis via a more detailed gait classification study in the future."

In particular, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has restricted trip and public transportation usage of many traveller. For public transportation services, it is very important to secure the stability of the public transportation system by analyzing various factors that affect public transportation use and predicting changes in the use of passengers. To this end, it is necessary to establish a system that can constantly monitor and respond to changes in public transportation use according to various event situations.  Therefore, as a basic study for this purpose, this study analyzed changes in usage according to major events such as season, day of the week, weather, air pollution, and infectious disease targeting Gyeonggi metropolitan buses. And this study developed a model for predicting the demand for Gyeonggi metropolitan bus use using deep learning techniques, which is one of machine learning.  In this study, data such as season, weather, air pollution, infectious diseases, and metropolitan bus number of passengers were collected, and these data were processed according to the purpose of forecasting the daily demand for the Gyeonggi metropolitan bus use. After that, a relationship analysis was performed between various public transportation environment variables and the demand for use of Gyeonggi metropolitan buses. And a regression model of Gyeonggi metropolitan bus demand using statistical method was constructed for comparison and analysis with the deep learning model. Finally, this study developed three models using deep learning technique of machine learning: ① demand per population model for comparison with statistical model, ② Gyeonggi metropolitan bus demand model, ③ individual bus line demand model. These models were implemented using TensorFlow, a machine learning open source platform.  Since the deep learning models developed in this study are not restricted by input data, various variables can be considered. Therefore, deep learning model had better prediction accuracy than the statistical model, and the Gyeonggi metropolitan bus demand model showed up to 91.0% and individual bus line demand model up to 87.3% in prediction for the next 7 days. The overall model development results showed that the model explanatory power for the learning data was high, but the prediction accuracy was under-predicted. This result is because the degree of reaction of travelers is changing as COVID-19 continues for a long time. In the end, in order to build a more accurate and complete model in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is necessary to secure additional data that can reflect longer-term and diverse changes. It is very important to predict the demand for use in order to establish operation plans and policies for public transportation such as metropolitan buses. It is expected that this study can be used as a basic research in these areas."

First, in the process of setting the network classification starting point, the division starting point of the network structure for effective feature vector extraction is set. Second, in the feature vector extraction process, feature vectors are extracted without additional learning using the weights previously learned.

With the advent of the Data-driven era, IT technologys development is spilling out many data from individuals to objects. Companies or individuals have accumulated, processed, and analyzed such a large amount of data that they can now make decisions or execute directly using data that used to depend on experts. Nowadays, the recommender system plays a vital role in determining the users preferences to purchase goods and uses a recommender system to induce clicks on web services (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Youtube). For example, Youtubes recommender system, which is used by 1 billion people worldwide every month, includes videos that users like, like and videos they watched. Recommended system research is deeply linked to practical business. Therefore, many researchers are interested in building better solutions. Recommender systems use the information obtained from their users to generate recommendations because the development of the provided recommender systems requires information on items that are likely to be preferred by the user. We began to trust patterns and rules derived from data rather than empirical intuition through the recommender systems. The capacity and development of data have led machine learning to develop deep learning. However, such recommender systems are not all solutions. Proceeding with the recommender systems, there should be no scarcity in all data and a sufficient amount. Also, it requires detailed information about the individual. The recommender systems work correctly when these conditions operate. The recommender systems become a complex problem for both consumers and sellers when the interaction log is insufficient. Because the sellers perspective needs to make recommendations at a personal level to the consumer and receive appropriate recommendations with reliable data from the consumers perspective.  In this paper, to improve the accuracy problem for appropriate recommendation to consumers, the recommender systems are proposed in combination with context-based deep learning. This research is to combine user-based data to create hybrid Recommender Systems. The hybrid approach developed is not a collaborative type of Recommender Systems, but a collaborative extension that integrates user data with deep learning. Customer review data were used for the data set. Consumers buy products in online shopping malls and then evaluate product reviews. Rating reviews are based on reviews from buyers who have already purchased, giving users confidence before purchasing the product. However, the recommendation system mainly uses scores or ratings rather than reviews to suggest items purchased by many users. In fact, consumer reviews include product opinions and user sentiment that will be spent on evaluation. By incorporating these parts into the study, this paper aims to improve the recommendation system. This study is an algorithm used when individuals have difficulty in selecting an item. Consumer reviews and record patterns made it possible to rely on recommendations appropriately. The algorithm implements a recommendation system through collaborative filtering. This studys predictive accuracy is measured by Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Netflix is strategically using the referral system in its programs through competitions that reduce RMSE every year, making fair use of predictive accuracy.

The presented study develops and compares classifier-based and deep learning-based models that can effectively determine pavement roughness grades. METHODS : A set road specimen was developed for various IRIs by generating road profiles with matching standard deviations. In addition, five distinct features from road images, including mean, peak-to-peak, standard variation, and mean absolute deviation, were extracted to develop a classifier-based model. From parametric studies, a support vector machine (SVM) was selected. To further demonstrate that the model is more applicable to real-world problems, with a non-integer road grade, a deep-learning model was developed. The algorithm was proposed by modifying the MNIST database, and the model input parameters were determined to achieve higher precision. RESULTS : The results of the proposed algorithms indicated the potential of using computer vision-based models for classifying road surface roughness. When SVM was adopted, near 100% precision was achieved for the training data, and 98% for the test data. Although the model indicated accurate results, the model was classified based on integer IRIs, which is less practical. Alternatively, a deep-learning model, which can be applied to a non-integer road grade, indicated an accuracy of over 85%. CONCLUSIONS : In this study, both the classifier-based, and deep-learning-based models indicated high precision for estimating road surface roughness grades. However, because the proposed algorithm has only been verified against the road model with fixed integers, optimization and verification of the proposed algorithm need to be performed for a real road condition."

The proposed method consists of a two-step fighting behavior recognition framework. First, continuous video frames of the target surveillance video are transmitted to the Inflated 3D ConvNet (I3D) network, which shows a good behavior-recognition performance, to extract the spatiotemporal features. These extracted 3D features are then used as the inputs in the next step, where a fight situation is detected using a classification model consisting of a fully connected layer. To use the proposed aggressive behavior detection framework effectively, first, it is necessary to train the fight detection model. However, it is not possible to collect sufficient fighting videos in various outdoor environments. To overcome this limitation, we generated a large amount of learning data through data augmentation. Therefore, instead of directly learning from the training videos transmitted to the I3D network, the classifier trains itself to recognize various fighting actions using the Kinetics video dataset. That is, the action features are extracted from the transmitted consecutive frames using the pretrained I3D network and subsequently used to train the fully connected layer classification model. In addition, we proposed a learning method that includes recognizing ambiguous conflict boundaries using multiple instance learning to mitigate the ambiguous starting and ending of the contention videos. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified through several experiments by drawing comparisons between the present results and those of the previously reported studies."

However, compared with the normal state, it is a very struggling task to obtain fault data in real-industrial applications. Hence, the class imbalance problem can lead to worsening the fault diagnosis performance of deep-learning-based models. Stimulated by this motivation, several efforts have been made to achieve data augmentation via two representative algorithms, variational autoencoder and generative adversarial network. Unfortunately, the validity of these algorithms has been investigated only through qualitative comparison in the time and frequency domains. There is a great need to devise a quantitative metric that digitalizes the similarity between the experimentally measured and virtually generated fault signals.

Currently utilized data in architecture exists in various forms, making it difficult to manage and use the accumulated design information for other reasons. Therefore, this study proposes developing and utilizing technologies that recognize floorplan sketches, one of the analog media, and convert them into digital media, BIM, that computers can understand. (Method) This study is conducted in two parts: 1) floorplan sketch recognition, 2) utilization of recognized floorplan sketches. In the floorplan sketch recognition phase, we propose an approach that applies Generative Adversarial Network-based deep learning techniques to transform human-drawn floorplan sketch styles into one unified form. Specifically, to recognize the floorplan sketches, the deep learning model learns various forms of floorplan sketches and the styles it needs to transform in pairs. The consistent style has essential architectural elements labeled on it : wall, floor, door and window objects. The study uses apartment floorplan images as learning data for floorplan sketch recognition deep-learning model. The apartment floor plan dataset provided by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport Seumteo(e-ais) consists of scanned floorplan images of apartments, houses, and row houses in Seoul. In the phase of the utilization of perceived floorplan sketches, BIM models were generated based on the recognized floorplan sketches. They were subdivided and vectorized by object to extract coordinates, and this enabled BIM models to be obtained by using them as input values for Revit API. (Results) The floorplan sketches labeled with essential architectural elements were the output for the floorplan sketch recognition module, and it was successfully printed out. For the analysis of the study, the predicted image was compared by the ground truth image and showed success. For the second phase, the BIM model prototype made on the Autodesk Revit platform created a fast and accurate 3D BIM model when the recognized floorplan sketches were given input. The created model is low in detail, but it contains the geometry information and the property information, making it an easier way for future use. (Conclusion) This research and development is a sub-development of the overall intelligent design system. It identifies whether computers can recognize one of the design information, floorplan sketches as human beings, and suggests its potentials. Subsequent studies are believed to obtain a BIM model with a high level of detail if recognition is achieved by scaling out of the current recognizable target range."

Among various text analysis fields, text classification is the most widely used technology in academia and industry. Text classification includes binary class classification with one label among two classes, multi-class classification with one label among several classes, and multi-label classification with multiple labels among several classes. In particular, multi-label classification requires a different training method from binary class classification and multi-class classification because of the characteristic of having multiple labels. In addition, since the number of labels to be predicted increases as the number of labels and classes increases, there is a limitation in that performance improvement is difficult due to an increase in prediction difficulty.  To overcome these limitations, (i) compressing the initially given high-dimensional label space into a low-dimensional latent label space, (ii) after performing training to predict the compressed label, (iii) restoring the predicted label to the high-dimensional original label space, research on label embedding is being actively conducted. Typical label embedding techniques include Principal Label Space Transformation (PLST), Multi-Label Classification via Boolean Matrix Decomposition (MLC-BMaD), and Bayesian Multi-Label Compressed Sensing (BML-CS). However, since these techniques consider only the linear relationship between labels or compress the labels by random transformation, it is difficult to understand the non-linear relationship between labels, so there is a limitation in that it is not possible to create a latent label space sufficiently containing the information of the original label. Recently, there have been increasing attempts to improve performance by applying deep learning technology to label embedding. Label embedding using an autoencoder, a deep learning model that is effective for data compression and restoration, is representative. However, the traditional autoencoder-based label embedding has a limitation in that a large amount of information loss occurs when compressing a high-dimensional label space having a myriad of classes into a low-dimensional latent label space.  This can be found in the gradient loss problem that occurs in the backpropagation process of learning. To solve this problem, skip connection was devised, and by adding the input of the layer to the output to prevent gradient loss during backpropagation, efficient learning is possible even when the layer is deep. Skip connection is mainly used for image feature extraction in convolutional neural networks, but studies using skip connection in autoencoder or label embedding process are still lacking.  Therefore, in this study, we propose an autoencoder-based label embedding methodology in which skip connections are added to each of the encoder and decoder to form a low-dimensional latent label space that reflects the information of the high-dimensional label space well. In addition, the proposed methodology was applied to actual paper keywords to derive the high-dimensional keyword label space and the low-dimensional latent label space. Using this, we conducted an experiment to predict the compressed keyword vector existing in the latent label space from the paper abstract and to evaluate the multi-label classification by restoring the predicted keyword vector back to the original label space.  As a result, the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score used as performance indicators showed far superior performance in multi-label classification based on the proposed methodology compared to traditional multi-label classification methods. This can be seen that the low-dimensional latent label space derived through the proposed methodology we"

In order to design a real-scale FO plant, the performance prediction of FO membrane modules installed in the plant is essential. Especially, the flux prediction is the most important task because the amount of diluted draw solution and concentrate solution flowing out of FO modules can be expected from the flux. Through a previous study, a theoretical based FO module model to predict flux was developed. However it needs an intensive numerical calculation work and a fitting process to reflect a complex module geometry. The idea of this work is to introduce deep learning to predict flux of FO membrane modules using 116 experimental data set, which include six input variables (flow rate, pressure, and ion concentration of DS and FS) and one output variable (flux). The procedure of optimizing a deep learning model to minimize prediction error and overfitting problem was developed and tested.

Therefore, in this paper, to solve this problem, five types of license plates were created using a virtual Korean license plate generation program according to the notice of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. And the generated license plate is synthesized in the license plate part of collectable vehicle images to construct 10,147 learning data to be used in deep learning. The learning data classifies license plates, Korean, and numbers into individual classes and learn using YOLOv5. Since the proposed method recognizes letters and numbers individually, if the font does not change, it can be recognized even if the license plate standard changes or the number of characters increases. As a result of the experiment, an accuracy of 96.82% was obtained, and it can be applied not only to the learned license plate but also to new types of license plates such as new license plates and eco-friendly license plates."

In data design and data construction in the specialized domain area, it was decided that it could inherit the research results of existing dictionary studies. And researcher searched the structure and contents of semantic data, another artificial intelligence data to overcome the limitations of data for deep learning, and decided that the results of existing dictionaries could be fully utilized in ontology design and semantic data construction.Based on this, for practical case study, data for deep learning and semantic data through ontology design were experimentally constructed on the theme of Korean historical character dictionary. First, researcher constructed and experimented with the learning data of object name identification (NER) based on the annals data of the Joseon Dynasty using the object name identification (NER) method of deep learning. The problem that object identification of object name identification (NER) through deep learning only identifies the attribute of the object and does not recognize the uniqueness of the object is confirmed. Therefore, the possibility of semantic data was examined through experimental ontology design to build semantic data as knowledge that has various uniqueness through the relationship with the object’s time, space, and characters. In conclusion, if the concept and understanding of machine-readable data can be added in traditional dictionary studies, it is considered to be competitive enough in both deep learning data and semantic data through ontology."

Supervised learning-based anomaly detection requires a large amount of the normal and the abnormal data. However, it is difficult to get the abnormal data compared to the normal data. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a network for anomaly detection using only the normal data based on semi-supervised learning. It is a method that uses only the normal data to learn to fit 72 geometric transformations after using 72 geometric transformations. Furthermore, we improve performance by applying outlier exposure methods, which are methods to learn together by exposing the abnormal data. The abnormal data is not obtained additionally, but uses some from the normal data. The abnormal data are trained using a uniform distribution to avoid affecting the normal data. By using the abnormal data, we generalize anomaly detectors to improve performance on anomaly detection."

Recently, a new approach of using artificial intelligence for policing, known as smart policing, has been proposed. While various studies on smart policing have been discussed, most studies only focus on predicting the hotspot regions or the number of major crimes. The Republic of Korea has a policing system called the 112 system, and the need to incorporate smart policing to the 112 system is increasing gradually. However, the current 112 system is operating less efficiently by deploying the same number of police forces regardless of the number of expected 112 emergency calls. Moreover, studies related to the number of 112 emergency calls are not only insufficient, but also have limitations in that the number of emergency calls in the past has not been utilized. In this study, we propose a multimodal stacking model (MSM) that can predict 112 emergency calls by reflecting the temporal characteristics of the policing data and facilitate interpretation of the important variables. A deep learning-based recurrent neural network and a gradient boosting model are used together in MSM. The proposed MSM yielded excellent predictive performance in experiments using various kinds of regional characteristic data and 112 emergency call data."

The meat chunks are inspected for the presence of needles with an X-ray scanner. Although needles in the meat chunks are easily detectable, they can also be found in trimmings and meat offals, where meat skins, fat chunks, and pieces of meat from different parts get agglomerated. Detection of needles in trimmings and meat offals becomes challenging because of many needle-like patterns that are detected by the X-ray scanner. This problem can be solved by learning the trimmings or meat offals using deep learning. However, it is not easy to collect a large number of learning patterns in trimmings or meat offals. In this study, we demonstrate the use of deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) to create fake images of trimmings or meat offals and train them using a convolution neural network (CNN)."

The Korean Triage Acuity Scale (KTAS) is mandatorily applied at EDs in South Korea.For rapid triage, we studied machine learning-based triage systems composed of a speech recognition model and natural language processing-based classification.Methods: We simulated 762 triage cases that consisted of 18 classes with six types of the main symptom (chest pain, dyspnea, fever, stroke, abdominal pain, and headache) and three levels of KTAS. In addition, we recorded conversations between emergency patients and clinicians during the simulation. We used speech recognition models to transcribe the conversation.Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) were used for KTAS and symptom classification. Additionally, we evaluated the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values of features to interpret the classifiers.Results: The character error rate of the speech recognition model was reduced to 25.21% through transfer learning. With auto-transcribed scripts, support vector machine (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81–0.9), KNN (AUROC, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.85–0.93), RF (AUROC, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.82–0.9) and BERT (AUROC, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.75–0.87) achieved excellent classification performance.Based on SHAP, we found “stress”, “pain score point”, “fever”, “breath”, “head” and “chest” were the important vocabularies for determining KTAS and symptoms.Conclusion: We demonstrated the potential of an automatic KTAS classification system using speech recognition models, machine learning and BERT-based classifiers."

For practical human tracking applications, a target must be robustly tracked even in undetected or overcrowded situations. The proposed framework consists of two parts: robust deep learning-based human detection and tracking while recognizing the aforementioned situations. In the former part, target candidates are detected using Detectron2, which is one of the powerful deep learning tools, and their weights are computed and assigned. Subsequently, a candidate with the highest weight is extracted and is utilized to track the target human using a Kalman filter. If the bounding boxes of the extracted candidate and another candidate are overlapped, it is regarded as a crowded situation. In this situation, the center information of the extracted candidate is compensated using the state estimated prior to the crowded situation. When candidates are not detected from Detectron2, it means that the target is completely occluded and the next state of the target is estimated using the Kalman prediction step only. In two experiments, people wearing the same color clothes and having a similar height roam around the given place by overlapping one another. The average error of the proposed framework was measured and compared with one of the conventional approaches.

Specifically, we model a single spatio-temporal graph, in which nodes represent the geographic regions, spatial edges represent the distance between each pair of regions, and temporal edges indicate the node features through time. We evaluate this approach in COVID-19 in a Korean dataset, and we show a decrease of approximately 10% in both RMSE and MAE, and a significant boost to the training speed compared to the baseline models. Moreover, the training efficiency allows this approach to be extended for a large-scale spatio-temporal dataset."
A Review of Vision-Based Techniques Applied to Detecting Human-Object Interactions in Still Images,2021,"['Human-object interactions', 'Action recognition', 'Visual relationships', 'Deep learning', 'Hand crafted', 'Computer vision']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Due to the rising demand for automatic interpretation of visual relationships in several domains, human-object interaction (HOI) detection and recognition have also gained more attention from researchers over the last decade. This survey paper concentrates on human-centric interactions, which can be categorized as human-to-human and human-to-objects. Although an extensive amount of research work has been done in this area, real-world constraints like the domain of possible interactions make the research a challenging task. This paper provides an analysis of conventional hand-crafted representation-based methods and recent deep learning-based methods, ongoing advancements taking place in the field of HOI recognition and detection, and challenges faced by the researchers. Moreover, we present a detailed picture of publicly available datasets for HOI evaluations. At the end, the future scope of the study is discussed."

The CAC_auto system, in measuring the Agatston score, yielded ICCs of 0.99 for all the vessels (left main 0.91, left anterior descending 0.99, left circumflex 0.96, right coronary 0.99). The limits of agreement between CAC_auto and CAC_hand were 1.6 ± 52.2. The linearly weighted kappa value for the Agatston score categorization was 0.94. The main causes of false-positive results were image noise (29.1%, 97/333 lesions), aortic wall calcification (25.5%, 85/333 lesions), and pericardial calcification (24.3%, 81/333 lesions).Conclusion: The atlas-based CAC_auto empowered by deep learning provided accurate calcium score measurement as compared with manual method and risk category classification, which could potentially streamline CAC imaging workflows."

However, real-world data contains missing values for various reasons, which degrades the performance of prediction models learned from the poor training data. Therefore, in order to build a high-performance model from real-world datasets, many studies on automatically imputing missing values in initial training data have been actively conducted. Many of conventional machine learning-based imputation techniques for handling missing data involve very time-consuming and cumbersome work because they are applied only to numeric type of columns or create individual predictive models for each columns. Therefore, this paper proposes a new data imputation technique called ‘Denoising Self-Attention Network (DSAN)’, which can be applied to mixed-type dataset containing both numerical and categorical columns. DSAN can learn robust feature expression vectors by combining self-attention and denoising techniques, and can automatically interpolate multiple missing variables in parallel through multi-task learning. To verify the validity of the proposed technique, data imputation experiments has been performed after arbitrarily generating missing values for several mixed-type training data.

The prerequisite for the smart aquaculture industry is to effectively grasp the condition of fish in the farm. If real-time monitoring is possible by identifying the number of fish populations, size, pathways, and speed of movement, various forms of automation such as automatic feed supply and disease determination can be carried out. In this study, we proposed an algorithm to identify the state of fish in real time using underwater video data.

For real-time spill accident monitoring, an autonomous detection of HNS spills has been emerging as an urgent challenge. One of the main difficulty is to detect transparent HNS, such as benzene, xylene, and palm oil, in the visible spectrum. To recognize undetectable and transparent HNS, recent studies have attempted to utilize various optical images including ultraviolet (UV) images, blue channel images, and RGB images. Unlike the conventional imaging radar using the target’s reflectivity, recent researches try to exploit the optical characteristics and chemical properties of oil and hydrocarbon chemicals, which can be detected by optical images. For more accurate HNS detection, background complexity reduction algorithms, such as global background suppression (GBS) and adaptive target enhancement (ATE), have been proposed to reject redundant objects, including sun reflection, the flow of water, and the shadow of ships or clouds. Subsequently, several deep learning-based identification methods have been proposed to accurately detect HNS from background-complexity-reduced images. Specifically, faster regions with convolutional neuron networks (R-CNN) architecture-based HNS detection algorithms have been confirmed to outperform the conventional image segmentation methods in terms of time-complexity and HNS detection accuracy."

Hong Ryang-ho was a Gwan-gak Writer who studied under Jeochon Shim Yook and served as Yanggwandaejehak(兩館大提學), but left many writings through the practical writing of pragmatic statecraft. He pursued wide knowledge, seeking truth from facts, ranging from classical studies to Chinese characters to geography. He put the foundation of learning to classical writing(經術), and divided it into substance(體) and function(用). At the same time, he explained the principle of the nature(性理) as substance and political affairs(政事) as function, and stressed the need for a broad knowledge of history and literature to ensure substance and function to work smoothly.Behind his practical writing lies a unique theory of literature. Researchers have reviewed this in terms of literature, but this paper analyzed it in terms of his theory of ancient scripts. It was because Hong Ryang-ho was not just a prose writer, but a writer who pursued ancient style writing.He defined writing as reason attached to image and manifestation of the Way, and explained writing in a broad sense. He divided sages’ writings into two types: practicing the Way(行道) and propagating the Way(傳道), and advocated writing to express harmony through studies and to fulfill change of things. He declared that fine writing should universal truth, and pursued writing that could bring light to truth publicly in the world through deep learning.He also defined writing as process(經緯) and saw it as fine writing only when the way and the spirit was entangled. He diagnosed the flow of ancient scripts based on the way and the spirit, and found Six Classics as a model where the way and the spirit was entangled. He considered the writings of Qin/Han and Tang/Song Dynasties short of perfection of the way and the spirit. Therefore, he emphasized the cultivation of the spirit, saying that writing is impossible without the spirit as process(緯) despite appreciating the way as rule. He presented Great Spirit as a method of cultivating the spirit.Hong Ryang-ho saw the writings of the Former Qin and the Former Han most solid, based on the Six Classics. He criticized the writers of the Former Qin, the former Han, and Tang and Soong Dynasties based onacademic standards, giving Ga-ui the highest rating over Sima Qian. Hong Ryang-ho believed that Ga-ui had advocated ancient scripts of West Han, compiled the book 『Gaja Su-eon』 and followed his writing. He regarded Ga-ui as the only scholar who had both talent and scholarship, also with both substance and function, and evaluated him as the best writer in the Seo Han Period.Hong Ryang-ho's theory of ancient scripts is characterized by a compromise between the literary theory of moral scholars and the theory of ancient script scholars of Qin and Han. This is a new theory of the practical writing of pragmatic statecraft, with the model of ancient scripts in Six Classics, away from the two main trends of ancient script scholars of Qin and Han, and Tang and Song."

The study’s goal is to identify rules for automated visual image detection of body objectification and sexualization. To do so, previous qualitative study findings were used to identify target images and the cutting-edge object-detection deep learning algorithm, YOLO4 (You Only Look Once), and MediaPipe, a framework for deep learning-based pose detection, were used to search for patterns. As this is a one-of-a-kind study linking body objectification and algorithm-based object detection, the case for analysis must be carefully chosen, taking into account random effects from unplanned camera movements caused by real-time broadcasting. The dance to the song ’Rollin’ by the female group ’Brave Girls’ had already been broadcasted earlier in 2017. Thus, the on-stage choreography and camera movements associated with the song were already known, making them suitable for research data. The study used music programs that aired on three broadcasting networks, KBS, MBC, and SBS, during the second week of March, 2021. To fine-tune the patterns, 12 screen images were selected by extracting keyframes from the song’s original music videos. The study’s findings are summarized below. To begin, when the scene transition is associated with a significant decrease in the number of people in the visual frame in comparison to the previous frame, it is frequently associated with female body objectification. Because body objection is associated with an emphasis on a specific body-part in the absence of a face, this is essentially a zoom-in technique transited from a wide-angle view of the scene. This rule, however, is insufficient for detecting objectified visual images; it can also be applied to screen images that avoid sexualized images in the given dance choreography. As a result, an additional rule is required to exclusively find images of female body objectification, and it is discovered that detecting human faces on the screen appears to be a good measure. In other words, unless the human faces on the screen do not appear with the scene transition that shows a dramatic decrease in the number of humans in the scene, a visual flow of images can be considered female body objectification. The study also compared the levels of objectification across broadcasting networks and found that MBC has a lower proportion of sexualized images than that of other networks. On MBC’s music program, the MediaPipe framework for pose detection discovered fewer scene images with lower body parts than others. The findings of this study suggest that computer vision research can be used to detect female objectified bodies and sexual images in television programs."

Most of these models are trained with simulator data because of a lack of plant data for abnormal states, and as such, developed models may not have tolerance for plant data in actual situations. In this study, two approaches are investigated for a deep-learning model trained with simulator data to overcome the performance degradation caused by noise in actual plant data.

To perform a tidy-up task using a robot, it is necessary to estimate the pose of various objects and to classify the objects. Pose estimation requires the CAD model of an object, but these models of most objects in daily life are not available. Therefore, this study proposes an algorithm that uses point cloud and PCA to estimate the pose of objects without the help of CAD models in cluttered environments. In addition, objects are usually detected using a deep learning-based object detection. However, this method has a limitation in that only the learned objects can be recognized, and it may take a long time to learn. This study proposes an image matching based on few-shot learning and Siamese network. It was shown from experiments that the proposed method can be effectively applied to the robotic tidy-up system, which showed a success rate of 85% in the tidy-up task."

However, many deep learning-based studies are still focused on classifying the types of cracks. The classification of crack types is highly anticipated in that it can improve the crack detection process, which is currently relying on manual intervention. However, it is essential to calculate the severity of the cracks as well as identifying the type of cracks in actual pavement maintenance planning, but studies related to road crack detection have not progressed enough to automated calculation of the severity of cracks.

These ships entail high production costs and long-life cycles. Thus, modernized technical design, professional training, and aggressive maintenance are important factors in the efficient management of ships. With the continuing digital revolution, the industrial shipbuilding applicability of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies as well as related 3D system modeling and processes has increased. However, resolving the differences between AR/VR and real-world models remains burdensome. This problem is particularly evident when mapping various texture characteristics to virtual objects. To mitigate the burden and improve the performance of such technologies, it is necessary to directly define various texture characteristics or to express them using expensive equipment. The use of deep-learning-based CycleGAN, however, has gained attention as a method of learning and automatically mapping real-object textures. Thus, we seek to use CycleGAN to improve the immersive capacities of AR/VR models and to reduce production costs for shipbuilding. However, when applying CycleGAN’s textures to pipe structures, the performance is insufficient for direct application to industrial piping networks. Therefore, this study investigates an improved CycleGAN algorithm that can be specifically applied to the shipbuilding industry by combining a modified object-recognition algorithm with a double normalization method. Thus, we demonstrate that basic knowledge on the production of AR industrial pipe models can be applied to virtual models through machine learning to deliver low-cost and high-quality textures. Our results provide an on-ramp for future CycleGAN studies related to the shipbuilding industry."

As a result, four com- plications in educational goal, knowledge view, curriculum, teaching method have been derived. First, educational goal for future education should be focused on discovering and developing students’ ability. Second, knowledge view for future education should be set up according to wide, deep concept of learning. Third, curriculum for future education should be process centered and personalized. Finally, teaching method for future education should be self directed learning. The principles derived from artists have got intrinsic educational principles that reconfirm their will of life and experience their delight. The principles of existence and teaching method that come from artists can be borrowed for future education. If it happens, learning of students can be joyful rather than hard as it is to artists."

If a fish disease is not detected at an early stage in the farm, the disease spreads quickly because the farm is a closed environment. Therefore, early detection of diseases is crucial to prevent mass mortality of fish raised in farms. Recently deep learning-based automatic identification of fish diseases has been widely used, but there are many difficulties in identifying objects due to insufficient images of fish diseases. Therefore, this paper suggests a method to generate a large number of fish disease images by synthesizing normal images and disease images using SinGAN deep learning model in order to to solve the lack of fish disease images. We generate images from the three most frequently occurring Paralichthys Olivaceus diseases such as Scuticociliatida, Vibriosis, and Lymphocytosis and compare them with the original image. In this study, a total of 330 sheets of scutica disease, 110 sheets of vibrioemia, and 110 sheets of limphosis were made by synthesizing 10 disease patterns with 11 normal halibut images, and 1,320 images were produced by quadrupling the images."

The sows in group 1 were fed a 3% fiber diet under neutral ambient temperature; the sows in group 2 were fed a diet with 3% fiber under high ambient temperature (HT); the sows in group 3 were fed a 6% fiber diet under HT. Eight popular deep learning-based feature extraction frameworks (DenseNet121, DenseNet201, InceptionResNetV2, InceptionV3, MobileNet, VGG16, VGG19, and Xception) used for automatic swine posture classification were selected and compared using the swine posture image dataset that was constructed under real swine farm conditions. The neural network models showed excellent performance on previously unseen data (ability to generalize). The DenseNet121 feature extractor achieved the best performance with 99.83% accuracy, and both DenseNet201 and MobileNet showed an accuracy of 99.77% for the classification of the image dataset. The behavior of sows classified by the DenseNet121 feature extractor showed that the HT in our study reduced (p < 0.05) the standing behavior of sows and also has a tendency to increase (p = 0.082) lying behavior. High dietary fiber treatment tended to increase (p = 0.064) lying and decrease (p < 0.05) the standing behavior of sows, but there was no change in sitting under HT conditions."

Moreover, a recent randomized clinical trial reported additional polyp detection with shorter analysis time. Studies conducted regarding polyp characterization provided additional promising results. Application of AI with narrow band imaging in real-time prediction of the pathology of diminutive polyps resulted in high diagnostic accuracy. In addition, application of AI with endocytoscopy or confocal laser endomicroscopy was investigated for realtime cellular diagnosis, and the diagnostic accuracy of some studies was comparable to that of pathologists. With AI technology, we can expect a higher polyp detection rate with reduced time and cost by avoiding unnecessary procedures, resulting in enhanced colonoscopy efficiency.

This manuscript develops a novel deep learning-based method named Multi-Domain Convolutional Neural Network (MDCNN) to deal with this challenging task with vibration signals. The proposed MDCNN consists of time-domain, frequency-domain, and statistical-domain feature channels. The Time-domain channel is to model the hidden patterns of signals in the time domain. The frequency-domain channel uses Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) to obtain the rich feature representations of signals in the frequency domain. The statistic-domain channel contains six statistical variables, which is to reflect the signals’ macro statistical-domain features, respectively. Firstly, in the proposed MDCNN, time-domain and frequency-domain channels are processed by CNN individually with various filters. Secondly, the CNN extracted features from time, and frequency domains are merged as time-frequency features. Lastly, time-frequency domain features are fused with six statistical variables as the comprehensive features for identifying the fault. Thereby, the proposed method could make full use of those three domain-features for fault diagnosis while keeping high distinguishability due to CNN's utilization. The authors designed massive experiments with 10-folder cross-validation technology to validate the proposed method's effectiveness on the CWRU bearing data set. The experimental results are calculated by ten-time averaged accuracy. They have confirmed that the proposed MDCNN could intelligently, accurately, and timely detect the fault under the complex manufacturing environments, whose accuracy is nearly 100%."

Eliza in the drama shows that learning some language skills suddenly makes someone become a very linguistically talented and new person. Likewise a chatbot becomes linguistically skillful and a useful conversation counterpart through Data Base(DB) and Deep Learning.In this context, from the standpoint of linguistic anthropology, I will investigate some similar elements of artificial intelligence based chatbots and language acquisition inside Bernard Shaws drama Pygmalion . In particular, two main viewpoints such as language and gender as well as terms of address and social identity are employed for analysis. Firstly, Higgins s language classes for Eliza have crucial weak points in so far that they can not provide proper women s language.For example, womens usage of slang or swearing in English society are normally restricted by their mother and even their neighbours, but that is not the case for Eliza in the drama. Secondly, terms of address usually present social status and identity concerning speakers comparing to addressee. In the drama Higgins calls Eliza with her first name while Colonel Pickering addresses her with her last name, Miss Doolittle.

So, there is a limit to detecting abnormal symptoms of the infants and young children, who have difficulty expressing their opinions. This paper proposes an improved facial expression recognition algorithm for detecting abnormal symptoms in infants and young children. The proposed method uses an object detection model to detect infants and young children in an image, then It acquires the coordinates of the eyes, nose, and mouth, which are key elements of facial expression recognition. Finally, facial expression recognition is performed by applying a selective sharpening filter based on the obtained coordinates. According to the experimental results, the proposed algorithm improved by 2.52%, 1.12%, and 2.29%, respectively, for the three expressions of neutral, happy, and sad in the UTK dataset."

Conventional cardiac MRI is limited by the long acquisition time, the need for ECG gating and/or long breathhold, and insufficient spatiotemporal resolution.Real-time cardiac cine MRI refers to high spatiotemporal cardiac imaging using data acquired continuously without synchronization or binning, and therefore of potential interest in overcoming the limitations of conventional cardiac MRI. Novel acquisition and reconstruction techniques must be employed to facilitate real-time cardiac MRI. The goal of this study is to discuss methods that have been developed for realtime cardiac MRI. In particular, we classified existing techniques into two categories based on the use of non-iterative and iterative reconstruction. In addition, we present several research trends in this direction, including deep learning-based image reconstruction and other advanced real-time cardiac MRI strategies that reconstruct images acquired from real-time free-breathing techniques."

Courtly Discussions on The Book of Ode was answered by 18 servants to King Jeong-jo's question about The Book of Ode, which is a vast amount of data with as many as 595 questions and answers. However, only one person's answer was recorded in one question, making it difficult to investigate the rest of the people's answers, but Kim Heesoon's Sanmokheonjip, Choi Byeok's Jillamjip and Jeong Yagyong's Yeoyudang jeonseo, separately included their answers, so this paper used them as the main data. It is thought that the work of tracing the deep consideration and thinking about the answer of King Jeong-jo and his servants on The Book of Ode in the literature-related questions and answers will help juniors learn The Book of Ode and explore the academic culture of the time.In this paper, we compared the contents of Courtly Discussions on The Book of Ode and the collection of these characters, and found the following peculiarities. First, It emphasized graphonomy. Sulmunhaeja is the most frequently used main annotation in The Book of Ode. Of the 30 clauses asked by King Jeong-jo in Junam, 13 are deeply related to graphonomy, and 13 clauses in the case of Sonam. The second is King Jeong-jo's erudition. A vast volume of Gyeongsagangui which King Jeongjo inquired about the scriptures with his servants, and 595 clauses of Courtly Discussions on The Book of Ode, including Jipjeon, Yegi, Euirea, Zhuziyulei, Zhuyuk, Daehak, Yia, Zhurea, Gajasinseo, are enough to gauge King Jeong-jo's interest in learning. Third, Jeong Yakgyong's broad answer. Of the 18 subjects, he left the most answers to Yeoyudang jeonseo, which he wrote in detail, citing numerous authentic precedents compared to other persons.In addition, some of the following questions were captured. These are the errors between Courtly Discussions on The Book of Ode and the contents of other servant’s literary works and the criteria by which the answers are included in the Courtly Discussions on The Book of Ode. There are many cases in which what is included in Courtly Discussions on The Book of Ode is not in the collection of other servant’s literary works who exchanged questions and answers, and vice versa. In some cases, the contents of the answer are different even if it is included on both sides. However, there are cases where the opposite position of other subjects is included, or the short content of the same position is included in Courtly Discussions on The Book of Ode. This question is left as a future task because it is necessary to explore and solve more data such as Byeonpung and Asong."

In the shipping industry, since fuel oil accounts for the largest portion of ship operation costs and its price is highly volatile, so companies can secure market competitiveness by making fuel oil purchasing decisions based on rational and scientific method. In this paper, short-term predictive analysis of HSFO 380CST in Singapore is conducted by using three recurrent neural network models like RNN, LSTM, and GRU. As a result, first, the forecasting performance of RNN models is better than LSTM and GRUs using long-term memory, and thus the predictive contribution of long-term information is low. Second, since the predictive performance of recurrent neural network models is superior to the previous studies using econometric models, it is confirmed that the recurrent neural network models should consider nonlinear properties of bunker price. The result of this paper will be helpful to improve the decision quality of bunker purchasing."

As the pandemic situation changes individuals perceptions and behavior of travel, strategies for the recovery of the tourism industry have been discussed. However, since most studies present macro strategies in terms of traditional lodging providers and the government, there is a significant lack of discussion on differentiated pandemic response strategies considering the peculiarity of the sharing economy centered on peer-to-peer transactions. This study discusses the marketing strategy for individual hosts of Airbnb during COVID-19. We empirically analyze the effect of changes in listing descriptions posted by the Airbnb hosts on listing performance after COVID-19 was outbroken. We extract nine aspects described in the listing descriptions using the Attention-Based Aspect Extraction model, which is a deep learning-based aspect extraction method. We model the effect of aspect changes on listing performance after the COVID-19 by observing the frequency of each aspect appeared in the text. In addition, we compare those effects across the types of Airbnb listing.

This is a difficult task keeping in mind the constantly volatile image landscape with varying features and attributes. For a system to be beneficial in industrial settings, it is pertinent that its efficiency isn't compromised when running on roads, intersections, and busy streets. However, recognition in such uncontrolled circumstances is a major problem in real-life applications. In this paper, the main problem of face recognition in which full face is not visible (Occlusion). This is a common occurrence as any person can change his features by wearing a scarf, sunglass or by merely growing a mustache or beard. Such types of discrepancies in facial appearance are frequently stumbled upon in an uncontrolled circumstance and possibly will be a reason to the security systems which are based upon face recognition. These types of variations are very common in a real-life environment. It has been analyzed that it has been studied less in literature but now researchers have a major focus on this type of variation. Existing state-of-the-art techniques suffer from several limitations. Most significant amongst them are low level of usability and poor response time in case of any calamity. In this paper, an improved face recognition system is developed to solve the problem of occlusion known as FRS-OCC. To build the FRS-OCC system, the color and texture features are used and then an incremental learning algorithm (Learn++) to select more informative features. Afterward, the trained stack-based autoencoder (SAE) deep learning algorithm is used to recognize a human face. Overall, the FRS-OCC system is used to introduce such algorithms which enhance the response time to guarantee a benchmark quality of service in any situation. To test and evaluate the performance of the proposed FRS-OCC system, the AR face dataset is utilized. On average, the FRS-OCC system is outperformed and achieved SE of 98.82%, SP of 98.49%, AC of 98.76% and AUC of 0.9995 compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

As the revival of Confucianism during Yuan Shikai’s reign became active, opposition from Christianity and other religious circles immediately intensified. Students and intellects baptized from western sciences and thoughts refused Confucianism as state religion and claimed anti-religion. Through New Youths, Young China, Life, and so on, religious debates of the period can be grasped.  Marxists defined religions as fantasies of future world and as opium of suppressed people, and asserted abolishment of them. Anarchists perceived religions as a kind of authoritative systems, and discerned that they infringed sciences and disturbed free developments of individual human beings. Scientism advocated that as all kinds of phenomena and problems among mankinds and in societies could be resolved within sciences, sciences should replace religions. Such anti-religious trends arose from opposition against Confucianism as state religion, and rapidly spread out within the upsurge of nationalism and anti-imperialism.   Regarding religions, Liang Qichao and Cai Yuanpei Chen Duxiu differed in their opinions by pros and cons, but were same in the point in which they understood religions as productions of emotions. Cai Yuanpei, the naysayer, separated religions from the boundaries of morals and education, and replaced them with aesthetic education. Chen Duxiu recognized the greatness and existence of Jesus from the emotional perspective excluding the sacred, and cultivated deep-seated affection by himself. Liu Boming Liang Shumíng Tu Xiaoshi who were friendly toward religions claimed that the essence of religions as a transcendental inner tendency is placed in each individual’s mind, and that it ought to be cultivated and guided. At the same time, they saw that a religion can be a competence maintaining social orders and cultural spirits. For the result from the fact that western science and ration overwhelmed hereditary Confucian tradition, the assertion that science should replace religion became fierce. Hu Shi with a strong atheistic tendency admired Jesus, but he respected merely his personality and achievements, and Christianity was not his religion. Chen Duxiu also fiercely criticized the Confucian tradition, saying that Jesus"" personality is admirable, but Christian doctrine is unreliable on scientific grounds.  Among Chinese intellects in the early 20<SUP>th</SUP> century, science gradually became an icon, it became hard to accept the value of religions’ existence within the trust on all-mighty of science. Youths and students thought that all religions were unscientific superstitions, and that as religions deprived human-beings’ rational capabilities and restrained liberty, so they were the biggest obstacles against humans’ progress. Regarding such all-mightiness of science, there were warnings and criticisms from Ling Qichao, but they did not show much power. The religious debates during the New Culture Movement can be considered as the victory of science. The status of science after the establishment of the Republic of China was never doubtable. Nevertheless, through this debate Chinese intellects could cultivate perceptions on religions and the Mystic Learning, and came to be incapable to unilaterally underestimate or to lightly judge religions.

백수 양응수의 삶에 대한 가치 의식 - 그의 한시를 중심으로,2021,"['양응수', '한시', '가치관', '경전', '실천', '무욕', '공정', 'Yang Eung-soo', 'hansi', '漢詩', 'korean poems written in chinese character', 'values', 'scriptures', 'practice', 'unselfishness', 'fairness']","기존의 연구는 양응수의 독서법이나 그가 스승의 상을 당해 심상 1년을 실천했던 사실, 그리고 그가 화담학에 대해 가졌던 인식 등에 주목하고 있었다. 그의 독서법이나 그가 남긴 <축장일기> 속 내용, 그리고 화담학에 대한 그의 견해는 모두 그가 가졌던 삶과 학문에 대한 인식이 투영된 것이라고 볼 수 있다. 따라서 본고에서는 그러한 삶의 모습을 가능하게 했던 그의 사상적 기반을 그가 남긴 한시를 중심으로 살펴보았다.양응수는 24세라는 젊은 나이에 과거를 포기하고 학문에 전념할 만큼 학자적 성품을 갖추고 있었고, 이러한 그의 성향은 많지 않은 그의 한시작품에도 고스란히 남아있었다. 그가 남긴 한시작품의 주요 주제 중에는 경전의 내용에 충실할 것을 노래한 것이 많았는데, 특히 말로만 인의를 주장하는 것이 아니라 『소학』 등의 경전에 나오는 내용을 몸소 실천할 것을 강조했다.또한 ‘하늘은 사사로움이 없고 공평하다.’는 『서경』과 『예기』의 가르침을 이어받아 자신의 운명에 대한 욕심에서 벗어나 자유로운 마음가짐을 그의 한시에서 표현하기도 했고, 이런 마음가짐은 ‘하늘과 사람은 원래 하나’라는 『주역』·『예기』·『심경』 등의 내용으로 발전되어 그의 한시에서 노래되기도 했다.양응수는 경전에서 말하는 ‘천무사(天無私)’·‘천인일야(天人一也)’의 가르침을 성취하기 위해서는 사람의 마음에서 ‘인욕’을 제거하는 것이 중요하다고 생각했고, 따라서 그의 한시 속에서도 인심과 도심이 둘이 아닌 것을 실현하기 위해 인욕을 제거해야 된다고 노래하기도 했다.하지만 꾸준히 노력한다고 해서 성현의 경지를 쉽게 성취할 수 있는 것은 아니었다. 성리학에 몰두한 이후 오랜 기간 동안 스스로를 수양하고 절제해왔지만 여전히 공부하고 실천해야할 것들은 적지 않았다. 따라서 만년의 그는 자신의 인욕을 완전히 제거하지는 못하더라도 하늘이 준 초심만은 잃지 않으려고 주의를 기울이는 내용의 시를 남기기도 했다.","Existing studies focused on Yang Eung-soo's reading method, the fact that he practiced mindfulness for one year to miss the deceased the death of his teacher, and the perception he had about the study of Hwadam(花潭). His reading method, the contents of the < Chukjang Diary(築場日記) > that he left behind, and his views on the study of Hwadam(flowers) can all be seen as a reflection of his perception of life and learning.Therefore, in this paper, I looked at his ideological basis that made such a life possible, focusing on the hansi-korean poems written in chinese character-he left. Yang Eung-soo gave up the civil service exam at the young age of 24 and had a scholarly personality to devote himself to his studies, and this inclination remained intact in his few poems.Among the themes of the poems he left behind, many sang about being faithful to the contents of the scriptures. In particular, he emphasized not only insisting on benevolence and justice with words, but also putting into practice the contents of the scriptures such as 『Sohak(小學)』. In addition, he inherited the teachings of 『Seokyung(書經)』 and 『Book of Rites(禮記)』 that 'the sky is unselfish and fair' and expressed a free mind in his poems, free from greed for one's own destiny. And this mindset was developed into the content of 'Heaven and Man are originally one', which appears in 『Book of Change(易)』·『Book of Rites(禮記)』·『Book of Mind(心經)』 did.Yang Eung-su thought that it was important to get rid of '人慾' from the human mind in order to achieve the teachings of '天無私' and '天人一也' in the scriptures. So even in his poems, he expressed that in order to realize that the human heart(人心) and the dao heart(道心) are not two, we need to get rid of greed.However, it was not easy to achieve the state of the sage by making steady efforts. After immersing himself in Neo-Confucianism, he has cultivated and restrained himself for a long time, but there are still many things that need to be studied and practiced.Therefore, in his later years, even if he could not completely get rid of his greed, he also wrote a poem that pays attention not to lose the original intention given by heaven. Not only in modern society but also in the 18th century, when Yang Eung-su was active, social success represented by rising in the world and gaining fame was what most scholars were aiming for.However, Yang Eung-soo gave up such social achievements and jumped into the academic path of Neo-Confucianism, making it the most important goal of his life to achieve mental and physical training and academic achievement. His attitude toward life is reflected in his poems as well, so his poetry seems to leave a deep impression compared to the works of other ordinary poets."

소셜미디어상의 개인정보 활용과 보호 - AI 채팅로봇 ‘이루다’의 개인정보 침해 사건을 중심으로 -,2021,"['AI 채팅로봇', '소셜미디어', '개인정보보호법', '동의', '이루다', 'AI Chat Robot', 'Social Media', 'Personal Information Protection Act', 'Consent to Personal Information', 'Iruda']","최근 다양한 분야에서 인공지능 채팅로봇 서비스가 활용되고 있다. 이전에는 이러한 서비스가 이미 정해진 알고리즘에 따라 고객의 질문에 단순히 답하는 수준에 그쳤지만, 최근 인기를 끈 ‘이루다’라는 AI 채팅로봇은 인간처럼 자연스러운 표현과 맥락으로 대화가 가능한 점을 내세우고 있다. 인터넷상의 방대한 정보를 수집하며 진화한 AI 채팅로봇은 인간처럼 자연스러운 문장 표현을 구사하며 사적인 대화상대로까지 발전하게 되었다.  그러나 AI 채팅로봇의 개발과 관련하여 개인정보를 위법한 방식으로 수집하고 활용하였다는 문제가 제기되고 있다. 그 중에서도 특히 논란이 된 부분은 특정 서비스의 이용을 위하여 수집된 개인정보가 추후 또 다른 서비스의 개발 과정에서 매우 폭넓은 범위로 활용된 점이다. 정보주체는 새로운 서비스에 활용될 자신의 정보가 어떠한 방식으로 활용될 것인지 예측하지 못한 채 앞선 서비스의 이용만을 위해 동의한 것이라고 볼 수 있다. 즉, 개인정보 동의 과정에서 해당 서비스를 위해 수집된 개인 정보가 향후 새로운 서비스의 개발에 활용될 수 있다는 점을 추가하여 향후 다양한 서비스의 개발에 활용할 여지를 남겨둔 것이다.  또 다른 문제로는 AI 채팅로봇의 개발 과정에서 일부 이용자가 제공한 카카오톡 채팅방의 대화 정보를 위법하게 수집하여 활용한 사례가 있다. 일반적으로 채팅방에는 최소 2인 이상의 참여자가 존재하는데, 해당 개발사는 대화 정보의 수집과 활용에 대한 동의를 대화 참여자 모두로부터 받지 않았다는 점이다. 따라서 이 부분은 개인정보보호법이 정하는 개인정보의 수집과 활용에 대한 동의절차를 준수하였다고 보기 어려운 사안이다.   현행 개인정보보호법은 개인정보의 수집과 활용에 관한 동의 절차를 규정하고 있다. 하지만 이번 이루다 사례가 보여주듯이 새로운 서비스의 개발자들이 개인정보의 수집과 활용을 위한 동의 절차를 간과하거나 정보주체가 예측하기 어려울 정도의 범위와 기간 동안 활용하는 것은 큰 문제라고 할 수 있다. 특히 2인 이상이 참여하는 채팅방에서 수집되는 개인 대화 정보는 참여한 개인정보 주체 각각으로부터 동의를 받아야 할 것이며 추후 새로운 서비스의 개발을 위한 동의 과정에는 기간과 활용되는 정보의 내용과 범위를 명시하여야 정보주체의 권리가 두텁게 보호될 것으로 판단된다.","Artificial Intelligence(AI) chat robot services are being used in various fields today. Although these services used to answer customers questions according to a predetermined algorithm, the latest AI chat robot called ‘Iruda’ presents that it can communicate in a humanlike natural expression and context. AI chat robots have collected big data on the social media and performed deep learning. Now the technologies show natural sentence expression like human and become a private conversation partner.  However, a problem has been raised that the personal information collected for the development of the AI chat robot was actually in an illegal manner. Particularly controversial fact is that the personal information collected for the use of a specific service was used in another service later. The information was collected and analyzed with a very wide range in the process of developing. It seems that the person who only agreed for the use of the previous service had not fully recognized if his or her very sensitive information to be used for the newly developing service. Whereas the service developers intended that the process of consenting to personal information explained and included the chance to be used personal information for new services development in the future, it still has an issue of insufficient explanation such as the period of time and the range of information for the data subject.  Another problem is the case of illegally collecting and using the conversation information of the KakaoTalk chat conversation provided by some users during the development of the AI chat robot. In general, there are at least two participants in a chat room, but the developer did not receive consent for the collection and use of chat information from all participants. Therefore, this is an violation of the consent procedure for collection and use of personal information stipulated by the Personal Information Protection Act.  As this Iruda issue shows, it is a big problem for developers of new services to overlook the consent process for collection and use of personal information. In particular, personal conversation information collected in Kakaotalk chat where two or more people participate must obtain consent from each of the participating personal information subjects, and in the consent process for the development of a new service in the future, the period and the content and scope of the information used must be specified."

Many studies are underway at the software or hardware level to perform artificial intelligence operations in embedded systems. In particular, the hardware-supported deep learning operations, such as GPU, in embedded system are limited, so a hardware deep learning accelerator is considered to be added in the architecture. Since such a deep learning accelerator performs a lot of data storage and movement and iterative parallel operation internally to perform complex neural network computation, it is required to analyze and optimize a precise internal buffer and data movement path management for efficient design of deep learning accelerator. In this paper, to model and analyze a deep learning accelerator in a virtual platform based on RISC-V, a deep learning accelerator is designed and implemented at the ESL level based on SystemC as well as main memory and NAND flash controller, then the data movement with storage and buffering effect were analyzed and examined on the developed deep learning accelerator.

Tensor Flow and Keras provide the results of the end of the learning in graph form. Thus, If an error occurs, the result must be discarded. Consequently, existing technologies provide a function to roll back learning results, but the rollback function is limited to results up to five times. Moreover, they applied the concept of MLOps to track the deep learning process, but no rollback capability is provided. In this paper, we construct a system that manages the intermediate value of the learning process by blockchain to record the intermediate learning process and can rollback in the event of an error. To perform the functions of blockchain, the deep learning process and the rollback of learning results are designed to work by writing Smart Contracts. Performance evaluation shows that, when evaluating the rollback function of the existing deep learning method, the proposed method has a 100% recovery rate, compared to the existing technique, which reduces the recovery rate after 6 times, down to 10% when 50 times.

Diagnostic Performance of a New Convolutional Neural Network Algorithm for Detecting Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip on Anteroposterior Radiographs,2021,"['Deep learning', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Hip dysplasia', 'Child', 'Radiography']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of a deep learning algorithm for the automated detection of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) on anteroposterior (AP) radiographs.Materials and Methods: Of 2601 hip AP radiographs, 5076 cropped unilateral hip joint images were used to construct a dataset that was further divided into training (80%), validation (10%), or test sets (10%). Three radiologists were asked to label the hip images as normal or DDH. To investigate the diagnostic performance of the deep learning algorithm, we calculated the receiver operating characteristics (ROC), precision-recall curve (PRC) plots, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) and compared them with the performance of radiologists with different levels of experience.Results: The area under the ROC plot generated by the deep learning algorithm and radiologists was 0.988 and 0.988–0.919, respectively. The area under the PRC plot generated by the deep learning algorithm and radiologists was 0.973 and 0.618– 0.958, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the proposed deep learning algorithm were 98.0, 98.1, 84.5, and 99.8%, respectively. There was no significant difference in the diagnosis of DDH by the algorithm and the radiologist with experience in pediatric radiology (p = 0.180). However, the proposed model showed higher sensitivity, specificity, and PPV, compared to the radiologist without experience in pediatric radiology (p < 0.001).Conclusion: The proposed deep learning algorithm provided an accurate diagnosis of DDH on hip radiographs, which was comparable to the diagnosis by an experienced radiologist."

Unlike recognition tasks, the real-time operation is essential in action control, and it is too slow to use remote learning on a server communicating through a network. New learning techniques, such as reinforcement learning (RL), are needed to determine and select the correct robot behavior locally. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient DNN processor with a LUT-based processing engine and near-zero skipper.

It supports 1b to 16b variable weight bit precision with and 57.6% and 28.5% lower energy consumption than conventional MAC arithmetic units for 1b and 16b weight precision. Also, the near-zero skipper reduces 36% of MAC operation and consumes 28% lower energy consumption for facial emotion recognition tasks.

The deep learning structure consists of a convolution layer, a bottleneck layer, a fully connect layer, and a softmax layer. The convolution layer is a layer that obtains a feature image by performing a convolution 3x3 operation on the input image or the feature image of the previous layer with several feature filters. The bottleneck layer selects only the optimal features among the features on the feature image extracted through the convolution layer, reduces the channel to a convolution 1x1 ReLU, and performs a convolution 3x3 ReLU. The global average pooling operation performed after going through the bottleneck layer reduces the size of the feature image by selecting only the optimal features among the features of the feature image extracted through the convolution layer. The fully connect layer outputs the output data through 6 fully connect layers. The softmax layer multiplies and multiplies the value between the value of the input layer node and the target node to be calculated, and converts it into a value between 0 and 1 through an activation function. After the learning is completed, the recognition process classifies non-circular glass bottles by performing image acquisition using a camera, measuring position detection, and non-circular glass bottle classification using deep learning as in the learning process. In order to evaluate the performance of the deep learning structure to improve quality of polygonal containers, as a result of an experiment at an authorized testing institute, it was calculated to be at the same level as the world’s highest level with 99% good/defective discrimination accuracy. Inspection time averaged 1.7 seconds, which was calculated within the operating time standards of production processes using non-circular machine vision systems.

Since the peak of the spectral signal contains physical and chemical information of the substance, accurate peak detection is an important process affecting the performance of the analyzed system. The widely used method for peak detection is the one based on the amplitude. However, this method is complex and subjective because it involves pre-processing or select and estimate parameters using visual inspection according to spectral signals. To overcome this problem, ROI detection of the spectral signal was performed through a deep learning model. The proposed method has the advantage of requiring no pre-processing and parameter setting.

Recent various discussions about AI presuppose the coexistence of humans and AI. Meanwhile, in order for coexistence to be achieved, it is fundamentally necessary for humans as individual beings to form relationships with others in an appropriate way. This study focused on the use of the virtue education method among the methods for AI to learn the order of relationships as an AMA that becomes the counterpart of human ethical behavior in the interaction between humans and AI. Method: This study presented basic data using the method of literature research. And based on this, a virtue education method that can be applied to AMA was developed and presented using the method of development research. With this, This research tried to argue about the necessity and validity of the virtue education method. Results: This study examines that the current discussion on ethical learning in AMA is mainly based on a Top-down approach based on traditional ethical theory. And as an alternative to this, it is suggested that machine learning and deep learning methods can be used as a method for AMA to learn ethics. Based on this, the characteristics and validity of virtue ethics applicable to AMA were presented. And as a method to learn it, a teaching and learning method applicable to the learning of AMA was proposed. Conclusion: Currently, the approach to preparing ethics for AMA tends to mainly choose a Top-down approach in which a specific ethical theory is selected and the design of a computational algorithm and system that can implement the theory is derived. However, just as children develop moral reasoning through appropriate developmental stages, AMA also needs to actively introduce a bottom-up approach to forming ethical judgment principles. As a specific method, we propose to use the method of grafting the virtue education method of analyzing the characteristics of a virtuous person and repeating it by imitating it to the deep learning method of AI."

Recent studies adopt machine-learning models for detecting cracks in asphalt road pavement using a Convolutional Neural Network.

Image Denoising with a Convolution Neural Network using Gaussian Filtered Residuals,2021,"['Convolutional neural network', 'Deep learning', 'Gaussian noise', 'Image denoising']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Deep learning using a convolutional neural network has become a state-of-art technique in image processing. In recent scenarios, image denoising using a residual image in deep learning has been popular. However, one aspect missing in these methods is that the residual image has all the noise and very small structured details of the input image. Therefore, we have developed a Gaussian filter residual convolutional neural network architecture for color image denoising. Gaussian residual learning was used to boost the denoising performance. The architecture is designed to remove additive white Gaussian noise, which is one of the most basic types of noise that affects an image when captured. The network with Gaussian residual learning removes the clean image using the features learned from the hidden layer. The peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index measure achieved by our method reveals that the presented approach is better at denoising images with Gaussian noise than a convolutional neural network."

Ensemble machine learning algorithms such as random forest (RF) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) are some of the most popular machine learning algorithms used for water environmental management, along with deep learning algorithms such as recurrent neural networks. In this study GBDT, an ensemble machine learning algorithm, and gated recurrent unit (GRU), a recurrent neural networks algorithm, are used for model development to predict turbidity in a river. The observation frequencies of input data used for the model were 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 120 and 168 h. The root-mean-square error-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR) of GRU and GBDT ranges between 0.182~0.766 and 0.400~0.683, respectively. Both models show similar prediction accuracy with RSR of 0.682 for GRU and 0.683 for GBDT. The GRU shows better prediction accuracy when the observation frequency is relatively short (i.e., 2, 4, and 8 h) where GBDT shows better prediction accuracy when the observation frequency is relatively long (i.e. 48, 120, 160 h).

A reverse reinforcement-learning model based on high-level player training data is established to support downstream algorithms. With less training data, the proposed model is converged quicker, and more consistent with the action strategies of high-level players’ decision-making.

Currently, inspectors visually inspect the infrastructure for maintenance needs, but this method is inefficient due to its high costs, long logistic times, and hazards to the inspectors. Thus, in this paper, a novel crack inspection approach for concrete bridges is proposed using integrated image processing techniques. The proposed approach consists of four steps: (1) training a deep learning model to automatically detect cracks on concrete bridges, (2) acquiring in-situ images using a drone, (3) generating orthomosaic images based on 3D modeling, and (4) detecting cracks on the orthmosaic image using the trained deep learning model. Cascade Mask R-CNN, a state-of-the-art instance segmentation deep learning model, was trained with 3235 crack images that included 2415 hard negative images. We selected the Tancheon overpass, located in Seoul, South Korea, as a testbed for the proposed approach, and we captured images of pier 34-37 and slab 34-36 using a commercial drone. Agisoft Metashape was utilized as a 3D model generation program to generate an orthomosaic of the captured images. We applied the proposed approach to four orthomosaic images that displayed the front, back, left, and right sides of pier 37. Using pixel-level precision referencing visual inspection of the captured images, we evaluated the trained Cascade Mask R-CNN's crack detection performance. At the coping of the front side of pier 37, the model obtained its best precision: 94.34%. It achieved an average precision of 72.93% for the orthomosaics of the four sides of the pier. The test results show that this proposed approach for crack detection can be a suitable alternative to the conventional visual inspection method."

Considering the current degree of development of AI technology, it is thought that the issue of copyright infringement occurring in AI learning stage should be solved more urgently than the issue of copyright infringement occurring in use stage of AI output. Artificial intelligence learning step requires large-scale data input and the use of almost all works as data, making it difficult to solve with conventional fair use law. Accordingly legislative cases in each country, including South Korea, are trying to solve the issue of copyright infringement that may occur in the AI ​​learning stage by placing a new fair use clause or a clause allowing text data mining (TDM). On the other hand, I am of the view that copyright infringement that may occur in the stage of using AI output can be largely resolved by the existing laws of infringement and tort liability. However, even in this area, ""depending on the development of technology,"" there could be marginal cases that are difficult for existing legal principles to solve.Whether an artificial intelligence output has creativity or copyright- ability is a matter that is directly related to whether an artificial intelligence output can infringe on other's copyright. On one side of the view that the copyrightability of artificial intelligence output should be denied, it seems that the current artificial intelligence output can only be used in limited areas such as stock articles, weather articles, and sampling music. Looking at the level of AI(GAN) artwork, chatbot and language translation using NLP, it is necessary to examine in detail whether the AI ​​technology grasps the context from a semantic point of view, and whether creative individuality is expressed accordingly. It is my view that whether pattern recognition, numerical vectorization of characteristics, and probabilistic models adopted by artificial intelligence technology have reached the point where AI can understand human expressions from the viewpoint of semantics not syntactics should be judged legally in the concrete case. An abundance of these discussions will lead to appropriate conclusions on whether to provide legal protection for artificial intelligence output or who to hold legally liable for situations in which artificial intelligence output is believed to infringe on other people's copyrights.This study also discusses the legal nature of open-source license associated with the Edmond de Belamy portrait case. In the AI development process, open source is widely used in the form of open source-based development platforms such as TensorFlow, development tools, and machine learning libraries such as PyTorch.

Recently, research using deep learning has been actively conducted. Among them, BERT is a deep learning model released by Google that shows good performance through transfer learning, and is a model that is widely used in sentiment analysis. The model generates training data through random masking when performing the mask language model task. At this time, if masking is performed with emotional words, it is possible to generate learning data focused on the emotions, and to increase the accuracy of the emotion analysis. Therefore, we propose a model optimized for emotional classification that generates training data by masking with emotional words and performs the mask language model task. As a result of conducting emotional analysis as a proposed method, it showed improved performance compared to existing methods."

With the accumulation of medical records, the evolution of computational power and graphics processing units, and the widespread use of open-source libraries in large-scale machine learning processes, medical artificial intelligence (AI) is overcoming its limitations.

For the specific implementation in this paper, we applied edge AI device-based EEG signal processing for emotion recognition. Background: The emergence of Electroencephalogram (EEG) based applications for intelligent applications is projected to have rapid advancements in the future. The BCI system enables efficient brain signal acquisition. Current intelligent convergence of EEG based applications includes brain signal processing integrated to deep learning models. It is expected that this convergence in intelligent EEG based applications will push through to on-device local processing such as edge AI devices for portability in state-of-the-art applications. The portability and practical usage of these systems in real-world applications could lead to the development and deployment of many other advanced embedded systems for EEG-based applications. Systems that can run locally on the edge without needing to be connected to a mobile network. Edge AI devices are the leading-edge computing platforms that process data locally to overcome the current constraints of IoT application. This paves way to the integration of edge-based processing as the computing paradigm to process and acquire EEG signals. Owing to the current research advancement for both EEG and edge applications, this paper aims to propose one of the many systematic applications of deploying edge-based EEG using a brain computer interface. Method: The input for this edge-based EEG signal processing is through the BCI interfaced to the edge AI device. The edge AI device deployed with a deep learning model for specific applications locally processes the acquired signal. These acquired signals are valuable for training deep learning models to realize practical applications at the edge. The processed EEG signals enable the system response of the system such as rapid emotion recognition. Results: Varying EEG signals were acquired in each of the BCI channels. These brain signals are segmented to different brain signal clusters such as Gamma waves (30㎐ to 100㎐), Beta waves (12㎐ – 30㎐), Alpha waves (7.5㎐ – 12㎐), Theta waves (4㎐-7.5㎐) and Delta waves (0.1㎐-4㎐) which have specific brain wave description. As for EEG emotion recognition applications, these wave signals are essential for efficient and accurate emotion recognition. The alpha, beta, and gamma waves are identified to be the most discriminative frequency ranges to identify emotion. Each of the EEG signal is classified for emotion recognition and identification such as 1) valence, 2) dominance, 3) arousal and 4) liking. High and low responses from these wave signals have corresponding positive, neutral, and negative emotions based on their neural patterns at parietal and occipital sites. Other applications can use the acquired EEG signals thus maximizing the possible application of edge-based EEG signal processing. Conclusion: The local processing of the EEG signal at the edge enables the edge-based EEG system application thus enabling system response and actuation. Edge EEG also enables local and cloud co-processing whereas this maximizes the benefits of the edge computing paradigm. With this co-processing capability, it enables an adaptive and portable real-time EEG signal processing which is a constraint to conventional EEG based emotion recognition system. Application: EEG is a physiological based emotion recognition which proves to be more accurate than conventional non-physiological emotion recognition. Also, with an edge-based EEG application, it enables portability and flexibility in terms of its deployment. This application aims to be a state-of-the-art innovation to existing physiological and non-physiological emotion recognition. Furthermore, this research paper implementation aims to emphasize the vast possible applications of edge-based EEG signal processing to bridge"

In this study, we propose a similar image classification performance improvement method based on CR (Confusion Rate) that considers only the characteristics of the data itself regardless of network optimization or data reinforcement. The proposed method is a technique that improves the performance of the deep learning model by calculating the CRs for images in a dataset with similar characteristics and reflecting it in the weight of the Loss Function. Also, the CR-based recognition method is advantageous for image identification with high similarity because it enables image recognition in consideration of similarity between classes.

Conventional deep learning based segmentation methods result in lower resolution and loss of object features during feature extraction and compression. Due to these losses, the edge and the internal information of the object are lost, and there is a problem that the accuracy at the time of object segmentation is lowered. To solve these problems, we improved PSPNet, which is a semantic segmentation model. The multi-scale attention proposed to the conventional PSPNet was added to prevent feature loss of objects.

Besides, companies that develop, distribute, or utilize innovative new technologies such as artificial intelligence have a problem that it is difficult to accurately predict a companys future stock returns and volatility due to macro-environment and market uncertainty. Market uncertainty is recognized as an obstacle to the activation and spread of artificial intelligence technology, so research is needed to mitigate this. Hence, the purpose of this study is to propose a machine learning model that predicts the volatility of a companys stock price by using the internet search volume of artificial intelligence-related technology keywords as a measure of the interest of investors. To this end, for predicting the stock market, we using the VAR(Vector Auto Regression) and deep neural network LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). And the stock price prediction performance using keyword search volume is compared according to the technologys social acceptance stage. In addition, we also conduct the analysis of sub-technology of artificial intelligence technology to examine the change in the search volume of detailed technology keywords according to the technology acceptance stage and the effect of interest in specific technology on the stock market forecast. To this end, in this study, the words artificial intelligence, deep learning, machine learning were selected as keywords. Next, we investigated how many keywords each week appeared in online documents for five years from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2019. The stock price and transaction volume data of KOSDAQ listed companies were also collected and used for analysis. As a result, we found that the keyword search volume for artificial intelligence technology increased as the social acceptance of artificial intelligence technology increased. In particular, starting from AlphaGo Shock, the keyword search volume for artificial intelligence itself and detailed technologies such as machine learning and deep learning appeared to increase. Also, the keyword search volume for artificial intelligence technology increases as the social acceptance stage progresses. It showed high accuracy, and it was confirmed that the acceptance stages showing the best prediction performance were different for each keyword. As a result of stock price prediction based on keyword search volume for each social acceptance stage of artificial intelligence technologies classified in this study, the awareness stages prediction accuracy was found to be the highest. The prediction accuracy was different according to the keywords used in the stock price prediction model for each social acceptance stage. Therefore, when constructing a stock price prediction model using technology keywords, it is necessary to consider social acceptance of the technology and sub-technology classification. The results of this study provide the following implications. First, to predict the return on investment for companies based on innovative technology, it is most important to capture the recognition stage in which public interest rapidly increases in social acceptance of the technology. Second, the change in keyword search volume and the accuracy of the prediction model varies according to the social acceptance of technology should be considered in developing a Decision Support System for investment such as the big data-based Robo-advisor recently introduced by the financial sector."

After the transient response decays out, the forced vibration behaviour of a structure due to a harmonic excitation force can be expressed as a linear combination of its vibration modes. Since the participation factor of each vibration mode varies depending on the frequency of the excitation force, its location, and distribution, only a few vibration modes with large participation factors can be used to approximate the forced vibration behaviour.

In recent years, several deep learning (DL) models have been proposed to improve detection accuracy. Among these, deep neural networks (DNNs) are the most popular, wherein the features are extracted automatically. Despite the increment in classification accuracy, DL models require exorbitant computational resources and power. This causes the mapping of DNNs to be slow; in addition, the mapping is challenging for a wearable device. Embedded systems have constrained power and memory resources. Therefore full-precision DNNs are not easily deployable on devices. To make the neural network faster and more power-efficient, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have been introduced for fewer operations and less complex hardware resources. However, the conventional SNN has low accuracy and high computational cost. Therefore, this paper proposes a new binarized SNN which modifies the synaptic weights of SNN constraining it to be binary (+1 and -1). In the simulation results, this paper compares the DL models and SNNs and evaluates which model is optimal for ECG classification. Although there is a slight compromise in accuracy, the latter proves to be energy-efficient."

Not only does this devastating disease record a very high mortality rate, but it can also cause serious chronic impairment of sensory, motor, and cognitive functions. Therefore, a prompt and professional diagnosis of the disease is highly critical. Noninvasive brain imaging data are essential for clinicians to efficiently diagnose the locus of brain lesion, volume of bleeding, and subsequent cortical damage, and to take clinical interventions. In particular, computed tomography (CT) images are used most often for the diagnosis of ICH. In order to diagnose ICH through CT images, not only medical specialists with a sufficient number of diagnosis experiences are required, but even when this condition is met, there are many cases where bleeding cannot be successfully detected due to factors such as low signal ratio and artifacts of the image itself. In addition, discrepancies between interpretations or even misinterpretations might exist causing critical clinical consequences. To resolve these clinical problems, we developed a diagnostic model predicting intracranial bleeding and its subtypes (intraparenchymal, intraventricular, subarachnoid, subdural, and epidural) by applying deep learning algorithms to CT images. We also constructed a visualization tool highlighting important regions in a CT image for predicting ICH. Specifically, 1) 27,758 CT brain images from RSNA were pre-processed to minimize the computational load. 2) Three different CNN-based models (ResNet, EfficientNet-B2, and EfficientNet-B7) were trained based on a training image data set. 3) Diagnosis performance of each of the three models was evaluated based on an independent test image data set: As a result of the model comparison, EfficientNet-B7's performance (classification accuracy = 91%) was a way greater than the other models. 4) Finally, based on the result of EfficientNet-B7, we visualized the lesions of internal bleeding using the Grad-CAM. Our research suggests that artificial intelligence-based diagnostic systems can help diagnose and treat brain diseases resolving various problems in clinical situations."

Since real estate has the characteristic of immobility, the characteristics of a region have a great influence on the price of real estate. In addition, real estate prices are closely related to economic development and are a major concern for policy makers and investors. Accurate house price forecasting is necessary to prepare for the impact of house price fluctuations. To improve the performance of our predictive models, we applied LSTM, a widely used deep learning technique for predicting time series data.Design/methodology/approachThis study used time series data on real estate prices provided by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. For time series data preprocessing, HP filters were applied to decompose trends and SOM was used to cluster regions with similar price directions. To build a real estate price prediction model, SVR and LSTM were applied, and the prices of regions classified into similar clusters by SOM were used as input variables.FindingsThe clustering results showed that the region of the same cluster was geographically close, and it was possible to confirm the characteristics of being classified as the same cluster even if there was a price level and a similar industry group. As a result of predicting real estate prices in 1, 2, and 3 months, LSTM showed better predictive performance than SVR, and LSTM showed better predictive performance in long-term forecasting 3 months later than in 1-month short-term forecasting."

Therefore, it is essential to develop efficient adversarial attack algorithms to identify potential risks and build a robust system.

However, the generated patches are quite perceptible for humans, violating the fundamental assumption of adversarial examples. In this work, we present task-specific loss functions that can generate imperceptible adversarial patches based on camouflaged patterns.

The framework was proposed to automatically quantify the periodontal bone loss and classify periodontitis for each individual tooth into four stages according to the criteria that was proposed at the 2017 World Workshop. Radiographic bone level (or CEJ level) was detected using deep learning with a simple structure of the entire jaw in panoramic radiographs. Next, the percent ratio analysis of the radiographic bone loss combined the tooth long-axis with periodontal bone and CEJ levels. The percentage ratios can be used to automatically classify periodontal bone loss. Additionally, the number of missing teeth was quantified by detecting the position of the missing teeth in the panoramic radiographs. A multi-device study was also performed to verify the generality of the developed method. The mean absolute difference (MAD) between periodontitis stages by the automatic method and by the radiologists was 0.31 overall for all the teeth in the whole jaw. The MADs for the images from the multiple devices were 0.25, 0.34, and 0.35 for devices 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

We evaluated the utility of LSVR, automatically measured from CT images using a deep learning algorithm, as a predictor of hepatic decompensation and transplantation-free survival in patients with hepatitis B viral (HBV)-compensated cirrhosis.Materials and Methods: A deep learning algorithm was used to measure the LSVR in a cohort of 1027 consecutive patients (mean age, 50.5 years; 675 male and 352 female) with HBV-compensated cirrhosis who underwent liver CT (2007–2010). Associations of LSVR with hepatic decompensation and transplantation-free survival were evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards and competing risk analyses, accounting for either the Child-Pugh score (CPS) or Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and other variables. The risk of the liver-related events was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Aalen-Johansen estimator.Results: After adjustment for either CPS or MELD and other variables, LSVR was identified as a significant independent predictor of hepatic decompensation (hazard ratio for LSVR increase by 1, 0.71 and 0.68 for CPS and MELD models, respectively; p < 0.001) and transplantation-free survival (hazard ratio for LSVR increase by 1, 0.8 and 0.77, respectively; p < 0.001). Patients with an LSVR of < 2.9 (n = 381) had significantly higher 3-year risks of hepatic decompensation (16.7% vs. 2.5%, p < 0.001) and liver-related death or transplantation (10.0% vs. 1.1%, p < 0.001) than those with an LSVR ≥ 2.9 (n = 646). When patients were stratified according to CPS (Child-Pugh A vs. B–C) and MELD (< 10 vs. ≥ 10), an LSVR of < 2.9 was still associated with a higher risk of liver-related events than an LSVR of ≥ 2.9 for all Child-Pugh (p ≤ 0.045) and MELD (p ≤ 0.009) stratifications.Conclusion: The LSVR measured on CT can predict hepatic decompensation and transplantation-free survival in patients with HBV-compensated cirrhosis."

The aim of this research was to classify the pleural effusion etiology with deep learning models using contrastive loss.MethodsAll patients with pleural effusion who underwent thoracentesis between January 2009 and December 2019 at Asan Medical Center were retrospectively analyzed. Five different models (multinomial logistic regression, random forest, gradient boost, deep neural network, contrastive-loss) were compared for categorizing the etiology of pleural effusion. The performance metrics were top-1 accuracy, top-2 accuracy, and micro- and weighted-AUROC. To visualize the embedding space of the contrastive-loss model, UMAP and t-SNE were used.ResultsWhile the five models showed similar performance in the validation set, the contrastive-loss model had the highest accuracy in the extra-validation set. Specifically, the accuracy and micro-AUROC of the contrastive-loss model were 81.7% and 0.942 in the validation set, and 66.2% and 0.867 in the extra-validation set.

In this paper, we devote ourselves to building an efficient protocol to classify users’ images using the convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained and held by the server, while keeping both parties’ data secure. Most previous solutions commonly employ homomorphic encryption schemes based on Ring Learning with Errors (RLWE) hardness or two-party secure computation protocols to achieve it. However, they have limitations on large communication overheads and costs in MCC. To address this issue, we present LeHE4SCNN, a scalable privacy-preserving and communication-efficient framework for CNN-based DLaaS.

Consistency regularization is the most successful approach in semi-supervised learning (SSL). The consistency regularization measures the discrepancy between the predictions from the student and teacher models. Minimizing the consistency regularization leads the student model to produce a robust output when the noisy input and model perturbation are given. Our intuition behind the proposed acquisition function is that the sample that produces inconsistent prediction between the student and teacher model should be labeled preferentially. In order to leverage the benefit of student-teacher structure in SSL, we adapt the stochastic weight averaging(SWA) for our acquisition function. We used the structure of the SWA ensemble model as a teacher model to achieve superior performance over the recent AL algorithm on CIFAR-100 dataset."

However, finding valid cardiac views has traditionally been time-consuming, and a laborious process because medical imaging is interpreted manually by the specialist.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely adopted to achieve significant performance in image recognition and classification. TensorFlow, an open-source deep learning framework from Google, uses profiling to select one convolution algorithm, from among several available, as the core of a CNN to deliver the best performance in terms of execution time and memory usage. However, the overhead from profiling is considerably significant, because TensorFlow executes and profiles all the available algorithms for the best selection whenever an application is launched. We observe that memory usage overshoots during profiling, which limits data parallelism, and thus, fails to deliver maximum performance. In this paper, we present a novel profiling method to reduce overhead by storing the profile result from the first run and reusing it from the second run on.

Therefore, the game can be recommended based on some game keyword tags for the user.

To generate the appropriate game keyword tags, the proposed method extracts the 100 representative game keyword tags from a game publishing platform Steam, and it performs the binary classification per tag. Finally, it selects 4 game keyword tags with the highest Softmax scores. Considering the accuracy improvement, a Korean game description set is used for finetuning and optimization, so that it updates both the BERT model pretrained with approximately 3.3 billion multilingual words, and the KoBERT model pretrained with approximately 50 million Korean words.

The previous studies claim that the c-command constraint regulates the distribution of relevant syntactic objects. As such, the syntactic effects of the c-command relation are greatly affected by the types of licensing (e.g. quantificational binding) and reading comprehension patterns of subjects (e.g. linguistic illusion). The present study investigates the reading behavior of the language model BERT when the syntactic processing of relational information (i.e. X c-commands Y) is required. Specifically, our two experiments contrasted the BERT comprehension of a c-commanding licensor versus a non-c-commanding licensor with reflexive anaphora and negative polarity items. The analysis based on the information-theoretic measure of surprisal suggests that violations of the c-command constraint are unexpected for BERT representations. We conclude that deep learning models like BERT can learn the syntactic c-command restriction at least with respect to reflexive anaphors and negative polarity items. At the same time, BERT appeared to have some limitations in its flexibility to apply compensatory pragmatic reasoning when a non-c-commanding licensor intruded in the dependency structure."

The proposed method receives skeletal information directly from the camera, extracts 2 time-series features of acceleration and distance, and then recognizes the fall behavior using the 2-Stacked Bi-LSTM model. The central joint was obtained for the major skeletons such as the shoulder, spine, and pelvis, and the movement acceleration and distance from the floor were proposed as features of the central joint. The extracted features were compared with models such as Stacked LSTM and Bi-LSTM, and improved detection performance compared to existing studies such as GRU and LSTM was demonstrated through experiments."

The proposed system consists of a server and an edge. The server manages the data, learns the advertisement recommendation model, and uses the trained advertisement recommendation model to determine the advertisements to be promoted in real time. The advertisement recommendation model provides predictions for various products and probabilities. The purchase index between the product and weather data was extracted and reflected using correlation analysis to improve the accuracy of predicting the probability of purchasing a product. First, the user information and product information are input to a deep neural network as a vector through an embedding process. With this information, the product candidate group generation model reduces the product candidates that can be purchased by a certain user. The advertisement recommendation model uses a wide and deep recommendation model to derive the recommendation list by predicting the probability of purchase for the selected products. Finally, the most suitable advertisements are selected using the predicted probability of purchase for all the users within the advertisement range. The proposed system does not communicate with the server. Therefore, it determines the advertisements using a model trained at the edge. It can also be applied to digital signage that requires immediate response from several users."

Generally, inactive regions are occurred when the non-rectangular formatted images are converted to the rectangular shaped image, especially when 3D images are represented in 2D format. Because these inactive regions highly degrade the compression efficiency, filtering approaches are often applied to the boundaries between active and inactive regions. However, the image characteristics are not carefully considered during filtering.

CCTV is installed in a high place and can observe a wide area, so there is almost no occlusion problem and has overall information about the surrounding environment. This point can be applied to security systems for public facilities such as ports and airports, and useful information that cannot be obtained from sensors attached to the vehicle in current autonomous vehicles can be provided to vehicles and pedestrians. In this paper, we developed a model for detecting multiple objects and specifying pedestrians by using port CCTV image data. The proposed method is 1) detecting 2D multi-objects through a GFL (Generalize Focal Loss) network that uses a port CCTV image as an input. The detection performance was improved and generalization error was reduced by applying a data augmentation to the input image that trains the multi-object detection network. In addition, when the detection result is a human object, the detection information is transmitted to a subsequent pose estimation network. The next proposed technique is 2) pedestrian-specification. Key points of a person are extracted through a pose estimation network using human detection information as input. Using AlphaPose as a pose estimation network, extract the overall area of the upper body of the person and then perform a pedestrian specification that obtains the color of the image as an RGB value. The color extraction accuracy is improved with an algorithm that removes a part of a person’s skin color that may appear on the upper arm or the like from the upper region. Finally the average value is calculated for the rest of the image and the color of the image is obtained as an RGB value. To verify the performance of the technique proposed in this paper, we experimented with the port CCTV dataset and the COCO dataset that widely used for 2D object detection."

In this study, a recurrent neural network (RNN) was utilized in predicting photovoltaic (PV) power generation. An RNN is an artificial neural network in which the connection between units is composed of a cyclic structure that can reflect the characteristics of time series. Therefore, to eventually incorporate a model predictive control technique for energy demand and supply matching, this study uses previously measured weather data and PV power generation data to predict the future PV power generation.Various optimization processes, such as normalization, classification of learning data, and setting of layer options, are performed to create a predictive model. Furthermore, 500 hidden neurons and 1 and 3 hidden layers are created and compared. The initial learning rate for both single and multiple-layer options was set to 0.05. As a result, the coefficient of variation of the root mean squared error, Cv(RMSE), which is a statistical index to assess the overall accuracy of the predicted values, was 13.8 % for a single layer and 13.2 % for a multiple-layer long short term memory model. Although no significant difference was observed between the two models, the multiple-layer model showed a slightly reduced error rate than the single-layer model, and the accurate prediction was confirmed to be achievable. Based on this study, a stable energy supply system can be established through linkage with energy storage control by predicting the amount of energy production through renewable energy sources and the amount of energy demand at urban scale."

Since the southern coastal region of the Korean peninsula was originally dominated by warm-temperate evergreen broad-leaved forests, it is desirable to restore forests in this region to their original vegetation. In this study, we identified suitable areas to be restored as evergreen broad-leaved forests by analyzing the environmental factors of existing evergreen broad-leaved forests in the islands of Jeollanam-do. We classified forest lands in the study area into six vegetation types from Sentinel-2 satellite images using a deep learning algorithm and analyzed the tolerance ranges of existing evergreen broad-leaved forests by measuring the locational, topographic, and climatic attributes of the classified vegetation types. Results showed that evergreen broad-leaved forests were distributed more in areas with a high altitudes and steep slope, where human intervention was relatively low. The human intervention has led to a higher distribution of evergreen broad-leaved forests in areas with lower annual average temperature, which was an unexpected but understandable result because an area with higher altitude has a lower temperature. Of the environmental factors, latitude and average temperature in the coldest month (January) were relatively less contaminated by the effects of human intervention, thus enabling the identification of suitable restoration areas of the evergreen broad-leaved forests. The tolerance range analysis of evergreen broad-leaved forests showed that they mainly grew in areas south of the latitude of 34.7° and a monthly average temperature of 1.7°C or higher in the coldest month. Therefore, we predicted the areas meeting these criteria to be suitable for restoring evergreen broad-leaved forests. The suitable areas cover 614.5 ㎢, which occupies 59.0% of the total forest lands on the islands of Jeollanamdo, and 73% of actual forests that exclude agricultural and other non-restorable forest lands. The findings of this study can help forest managers prepare a restoration plan and budget for island forests."

Operator fatigue can play a critical role in the reliability of such methods. This is important for inspecting high value assets or assets with a high consequence of failure, such as aerospace and nuclear components. Recent advances in convolution neural networks can support and automate these inspection efforts. This paper proposes using residual neural networks (ResNets) for real-time detection of corrosion, including iron oxide discoloration, pitting and stress corrosion cracking, in dry storage stainless steel canisters housing used nuclear fuel. The proposed approach crops nuclear canister images into smaller tiles, trains a ResNet on these tiles, and classifies images as corroded or intact using the per-image count of tiles predicted as corroded by the ResNet. The results demonstrate that such a deep learning approach allows to detect the locus of corrosion via smaller tiles, and at the same time to infer with high accuracy whether an image comes from a corroded canister. Thereby, the proposed approach holds promise to automate and speed up nuclear fuel canister inspections, to minimize inspection costs, and to partially replace human-conducted onsite inspections, thus reducing radiation doses to personnel."

This strategy ensures the subsea pipeline could be detected with low time consumption and satisfactory accuracy. The average precision (AP) of our proposed subsea pipeline identification strategy achieved 97.62% with 304ms time consumption for the bar image formed in the 10s period. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed subsea pipeline identification strategy is superior comparing with other state-of-the-art models in the performance of both identification and real-time."

If the generation in the engineering aspect is mainly to judge the presence or absence of a quantitative indicator or the correct answer and the incorrect answer, the creation in the artistic aspect creates a creation that interprets the world and human life by cross-validating and doubting the correct answer and incorrect answer from various perspectives. In this paper, the video generation ability of deep learning was interpreted from the perspective of collage and compared with the results made by the artist. The characteristic of the experiment is to compare and analyze how much GAN reproduces the result of the creator made with the collage technique and the difference between the creative part, and investigate the satisfaction level by making performance evaluation items for the reproducibility of GAN. In order to experiment on how much the creators statement and purpose of expression were reproduced, a deep learning algorithm corresponding to the statement keyword was found and its similarity was compared. As a result of the experiment, GAN did not meet much expectations to express the collage technique. Nevertheless, the image association showed higher satisfaction than human ability, which is a positive discovery that GAN can show comparable ability to humans in terms of abstract creation."
Lightweight CNN based Meter Digit Recognition,2021,"['Automatic meter reading', 'Lightweight Deep Neural Network', 'Image processing', 'Convolutional neural network']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Image processing is one of the major techniques that are used for computer vision. Nowadays, researchers are using machine learning and deep learning for the aforementioned task. In recent years, digit recognition tasks, i.e., automatic meter recognition approach using electric or water meters, have been studied several times. However, two major issues arise when we talk about previous studies: first, the use of the deep learning technique, which includes a large number of parameters that increase the computational cost and consume more power; and second, recent studies are limited to the detection of digits and not storing or providing detected digits to a database or mobile applications. This paper proposes a system that can detect the digital number of meter readings using a lightweight deep neural network (DNN) for low power consumption and send those digits to an Android mobile application in real-time to store them and make life easy. The proposed lightweight DNN is computationally inexpensive and exhibits accuracy similar to those of conventional DNNs."

We train deep registration models with rigidly transformed CIFAR-10 images and STL-10 images, and evaluate the generalization ability of deep registration models with transformed CIFAR-10 images, STL-10 images, and randomly generated images. Experimental results show that the deep registration models we propose can achieve comparable accuracy to the classic FFT approach for small CIFAR-10 images (32×32) and our LSTM registration model takes less than 1ms to register one pair of images. For moderate size STL-10 images (96×96), FFT significantly outperforms deep registration models in terms of accuracy but is also considerably slower.

The number of female victims in the general citizen is also increasing significantly. They often live without knowing whether their portraits have been synthesized into these images, and they often learn about their damage by their surroundings, so they do not have proper countermeasures, needless to say not to being prevented. Using deep fake technology makes it easier for individuals to create, sell, and distribute these sexual abuse videos as much as they want. In this case, due to the nature of online-network system, once a video or photo is synthesized and distributed, it is impossible to re-collect once posted, and it is extremely difficult to prevent the spread, so infringement of personal rights is not easy to remedy damage. There are several types of damages about personal rights that can be made by individuals.

However, the CNN model may not be suitable for emotional image data without the images regional features. To solve the difficulty of classifying emotion images, many researchers each year propose a CNN-based architecture suitable for emotion images. Studies on the relationship between color and human emotion were also conducted, and results were derived that different emotions are induced according to color. In studies using deep learning, there have been studies that apply color information to image subtraction classification. The case where the images color information is additionally used than the case where the classification model is trained with only the image improves the accuracy of classifying image emotions.  This study proposes two ways to increase the accuracy by incorporating the result value after the model classifies an images emotion. Both methods improve accuracy by modifying the result value based on statistics using the color of the picture. When performing the test by finding the two-color combinations most distributed for all training data, the two-color combinations most distributed for each test data image were found. The result values were corrected according to the color combination distribution. This method weights the result value obtained after the model classifies an images emotion by creating an expression based on the log function and the exponential function.  Emotion6, classified into six emotions, and Artphoto classified into eight categories were used for the image data. Densenet169, Mnasnet, Resnet101, Resnet152, and Vgg19 architectures were used for the CNN model, and the performance evaluation was compared before and after applying the two-stage learning to the CNN model.  Inspired by color psychology, which deals with the relationship between colors and emotions, when creating a model that classifies an images sentiment, we studied how to improve accuracy by modifying the result values based on color. Sixteen colors were used: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, purple, turquoise, pink, magenta, brown, gray, silver, gold, white, and black. It has meaning. Using Scikit-learns Clustering, the seven colors that are primarily distributed in the image are checked. Then, the RGB coordinate values of the colors from the image are compared with the RGB coordinate values of the 16 colors presented in the above data. That is, it was converted to the closest color. Suppose three or more color combinations are selected. In that case, too many color combinations occur, resulting in a problem in which the distribution is scattered, so a situation fewer influences the result value. Therefore, to solve this problem, two-color combinations were found and weighted to the model. Before training, the most distributed color combinations were found for all training data images. The distribution of color combinations for each class was stored in a Python dictionary format to be used during testing. During the test, the two-color combinations that are most distributed for each test data image are found. After that, we checked how the color combinations were distributed in the training data and corrected the result. We devised several equations to weight the result value from the model based on the extracted color as described above.  The data set was randomly divided by 80:20, and the model was verified using 20% of the data as a test set. After splitting the remaining 80% of the data into five divisions to perform 5-fold cross-validation, the model was trained five times using different verification datasets. Finally, the performance was checked using the test dataset that was previously separated. Adam was used as the activation function, and the learning rate"

The first chamber is equipped with two RGB cameras (top and side view), and a near-infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) system in the wavelength range of 900-1700 nm installed in the second screening chamber. Initially, the system was tested for early detection of chilling stress watermelon plants, a total of 350 watermelon plants were scanned before and after exposure to chilling stress conditions (-5℃) while moving through the chambers on the conveyor belt. An automatic image processing algorithm was developed for image segmentation and data augmentation.

Therefore, several studies have been conducted to overcome this problem, and one of them is a signal processing method based on wavelet transform. Up to now, discrete wavelet transform, which can compress the trace, has been mostly used for power side-channel power analysis because continuous wavelet transform techniques increase data size and analysis time, and there is no efficient scale selection method. In this paper, we propose an efficient scale selection method optimized for power analysis attacks. Furthermore, we show that the analysis performance can be greatly improved when using the proposed method. As a result of the CPA(Correlation Power Analysis) and DDLA(Differential Deep Learning Analysis) experiments, which are non-profiling attacks, we confirmed that the proposed method is effective for noise reduction and trace alignment."

In this process, the method of evaluating the performance of approximation uses the loss function. Existing in-depth learning methods implement approximation that takes into account loss functions in the linear approximation process, but non-linear approximation phases that use active functions use non-linear transformation that is not related to reduction of loss functions of loss. This study proposes parametric activation functions that introduce scale parameters that can change the scale of activation functions and location parameters that can change the location of activation functions. By introducing parametric activation functions based on scale and location parameters, the performance of nonlinear approximation using activation functions can be improved. The scale and location parameters in each hidden layer can improve the performance of the deep neural network by determining parameters that minimize the loss function value through the learning process using the primary differential coefficient of the loss function for the parameters in the backpropagation. Through MNIST classification problems and XOR problems, parametric activation functions have been found to have superior performance over existing activation functions."

In addition, most of the unmanned logistics systems have advanced technology that can identify the location by sensors and load or move goods without operator support or interference. And the unmanned logistics system requires a prerequisite that the pallet position is always in the correct position. However, since not all logistics processes can be automated, there are areas where this assumption does not apply. Various studies have been conducted to implement an unmanned automation system in these environments. Traditional vision-based image processing techniques have a fast processing speed, but there is a weak problem in the disturbance of images. On the other hand, the deep learning technique has a disadvantage in that the object extraction speed is slow due to the large amount of computation. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a method that can measure the exact position of the pallet by verifying the object at high speed while being strong against disturbance by appropriately utilizing the advantages of the two methods."

The proposed solution in this paper consists of two phases: the process of collecting vehicle location data in a privacy-presering manner and the process of predicting traffic volume using the collected location data. In the first phase, the vehicle’s location data is collected by using LDP to prevent privacy issues that may arise during the data collection process. LDP adds random noise to the original data when collecting data to prevent the data owner’s sensitive information from being exposed to the outside. This allows the collection of vehicle location data, while preserving the driver’s privacy. In the second phase, the traffic volume is predicted by applying deep learning techniques to the data collected in the first stage. Experimental results with real data sets demonstrate that the method proposed in this paper can effectively predict the traffic volume using the location data that are collected in a privacy-preserving manner."

This study first analyzed confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection and government announcements during the second wave of COVID-19 spread and divided the period into five phases. Then, news articles of 12 media companies were collected from online news portals and pre-processed into a 14,011 news corpus. The analysis methods were frequency analysis, keyword co-occurrence network, and Top2Vec modeling that uses deep learning embedding for time-series visualization. As a result, the articles related to “Social Distancing” showed a higher featured news ratio than “COVID-19.” The newspapers had a higher ratio of featured news preference than television. For featured news, the proportion of national, politics, economy sections and phase 1, 2 were higher than other sections and phases. However, the proportion of non-featured news showed more diverse section and increase in fifth phase as social distancing was mitigated to level 1. Regarding keyword network, featured and non-featured news shared many keywords related to the confirmed cases and social distancing policies. Still, keywords in non-featured news showed more diverse topic keywords. We found the keywords related to the confirmed cases and social distancing in whole phases. In terms of unique keywords, each phase reflected conflicts in social distancing and concerns about re-proliferation of COVID-19. For the news sections, information about confirmed cases and social distancing were found in whole sections. However, except for the national section, all sections showed unique keywords linked to conflicts and criticism about social distancing. The embedding topic model indicated an imbalance in the featured and non-featured news among some topics. For featured news topics, conflicts about social distancing and government announcements were found as major issues. For non-featured news, confirmed cases in the local community and various problems related to social distancing comprised major issues. In featured news topics, the social and political sections were influential in the first and second phases, and non-featured news provided more diverse sections and phases. For visualization, topics linked to conflict were concentrated in the first and second phases, and effects of policy changes were mostly found in the fourth and fifth phases. Topics that had lower correlation with social distancing showed irregular patterns. The results suggest that the news companies showed contradictory tendencies in their coverage of social distancing in the second wave of COVID-19, in the portal news environment and “featured news.”"

DDPG uses off-policy that uses ϵ-greedy policy for selecting action of current time step and greed policy for the next step. In the simulation, learning is given by negative reward when moving near singulairty, and positive reward when moving away from the singularity and moving to target point. The reward equation consists of distance to target point and singularity, manipulability, and arrival flag. Dual arm manipulators hold long rod at the same time and conduct experiments to avoid singularity by simulated path.

The images of the two successive scans were used to train the CycleGAN framework for image-to-image translation. The denoising efficacy of the CycleGAN algorithm was compared with that of hybrid and model-based iterative reconstruction. Repeated-measures analysis of variance and Wilcoxon signedrank test were performed to compare the objective measurements and the subjective image quality scores, respectively.Results: With the optimized CycleGAN denoising model, using the ULDCT images as input, the peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index improved by 2.0 dB and 0.21, respectively. The CycleGAN-generated denoised ULDCT images typically provided satisfactory image quality for optimal visibility of anatomic structures and pathological findings, with a lower level of image noise (mean ± standard deviation [SD], 19.5 ± 3.0 Hounsfield unit [HU]) than that of the hybrid (66.3 ± 10.5 HU, p < 0.001) and a similar noise level to model-based iterative reconstruction (19.6 ± 2.6 HU, p > 0.908). The CycleGAN-generated images showed the highest contrast-to-noise ratios for the pulmonary lesions, followed by the model-based and hybrid iterative reconstruction. The mean effective radiation dose of ULDCT was 0.12 mSv with a mean 93.9% reduction compared to standard-dose CT.Conclusion: The optimized CycleGAN technique may allow the synthesis of diagnostically acceptable images from ULDCT of the chest for the evaluation of pulmonary tuberculosis."

Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively analyze motivations of juvenile cyber deviance and to develop a predictive model for delinquent adolescents by integrating four different theories on cyber deviance.Design/methodology/approachBy using data from Korean Children & Youth Panel Survey 2010, this study extracts 27 potential factors for cyber deivance based on four background theories including general strain, social learning, social bonding, and routine activity theories. Then this study employs econometric analysis to empirically assess the impact of potential factors and utilizes a machine learning approach to predict the likelihood of cyber deviance by adolescents.FindingsThis study found that general strain factors as well as social learning factors have positive effects on cyber deviance. Routine activity-related factors such as real-life delinquent behaviors and online activities also positively influence the likelihood of cyber diviance. On the other hand, social bonding factors such as community commitment and attachment to community lessen the likelihood of cyber deviance while social factors related to school activities are found to have positive impacts on cyber deviance. This study also found a predictive model using a deep learning algorithm indicates the highest prediction performance.

Background: Machine Learning (ML) methods are increasingly employed to predict user behavior, particularly subjective impressions that cannot be automatically inferred from user interfaces (UIs) or from interaction logs. In this field, feature-based ML methods are often utilized instead of data-hungry deep learning ones, since collecting training data from human subjects requires considerable effort. The features for the models can be automatically extracted from UI code or screenshots with dedicated algorithms, which are an active area of research. Still, relying on human UI labelers is often considered a better option, since they presumably provide more accurate input data that allows more accurate prediction. Method: For about 500 homepages of universities’ and colleges’ websites, quantitative values for several UI features were obtained: number of UI elements, share of whitespace, etc. The values came from 11 human labelers of varying diligence, whose work quality was validated by another 20 verifiers. The dependent variables in the models were subjective impressions from the web pages, operationalized as the Likert scales of Complexity, Aesthetics and Orderliness, assessed by 70 subjects. Results: We built 33 linear regression models and analyzed their capability (as represented by R²s) to predict the subjective impressions. Conclusion: Although many research works propose new features for UIs and/or improvement of algorithms that calculate them, the discovered effect of the input data quality on the prediction accuracy was scale-dependent and, somehow unexpectedly, negative. Application: The results of our study might aid in balancing data quality and data quantity in projects that use ML methods to predict subjective impressions of website users."

Yorkshire can be used as a maternal line (YLD) or paternal line (LYD), which might affect final production. However, most pig farmers ignored it because it is difficult to distinguish one from the whole. The aim of this study is to classify two types of three-way crossbred pigs by learning pig facial data using CNN algorithm. Facial image data of three-way crossbred YLD((Y×L)×D) and LYD((L×Y)×D) were collected, and model training was sufficiently performed to prevent overfitting through data augmentation and dropout. The collected images were divided into training set and test set in an 8:2 ratio, and one-quarter of training data were used for validation. A data standardization process was performed to train the neural network algorithm smoothly. Convolutional neural network(CNN) were chosen for analysis, which is suitable for image-based classification. The architecture of the model is as follows: convolutional layer, rectified linear unit(ReLU) as activation function, max pooling layer, flatten layer, dense Layer. Then we compiled model using ‘adam’ optimizer and ‘categorical crossentropy’ loss value. Moreover, we used ‘early_stopping’ method in order to optimal learning rate adjustment. From the results of learning model, final accuracy and loss function were 0.9257, 0.2695 respectively. The confusion matrices for training, validating, and testing were performed for measuring modeling results. The accuracy of training, validating, and testing was 99.7%, 90.7%, 92.6% respectively, indicating that the model performance was remarkable. These results suggested that the CNN could be used to identity the breed line of pigs. Further research will be needed, in particular, there is need for sufficient data collection for the entire pig feeding period and additional research in the field of individual recognition."

To solve this problem, a multimode convolution neural network method is proposed to effectively improve the performance of facial expression recognition in video. Firstly, OpenFace 2.0 is used to detect face images in video, and two deep convolution neural networks are used to extract spatiotemporal expression features. Furthermore, spatial convolution neural network is used to extract the spatial information features of each static expression image, and the dynamic information feature is extracted from the optical flow information of multiple expression images based on temporal convolution neural network. Then, the spatiotemporal features learned by the two deep convolution neural networks are fused by multiplication. Finally, the fused features are input into support vector machine to realize the facial expression classification.

The development of deep learning technology has dramatically improved the performance of image classifiers. However, if the images are contaminated by noise, the performance degrades rapidly. Noise added to the image is inevitably generated in the process of obtaining and transmitting the image. Therefore, in order to use the classifier in a real environment, we have to deal with the noise. On the other hand, the autoencoder is an artificial neural network model that is trained to have similar input and output values. If the input data is similar to the training data, the error between the input data and output data of the autoencoder will be small. However, if the input data is not similar to the training data, the error will be large. The proposed system uses the relationship between the input data and the output data of the autoencoder, and it has two phases to classify the images. In the first phase, the classes with the highest likelihood of classification are selected and subject to the procedure again in the second phase. For the performance analysis of the proposed system, classification accuracy was tested on a Gaussian noise-contaminated MNIST dataset. As a result of the experiment, it was confirmed that the proposed system in the noisy environment has higher accuracy than the CNN-based classification technique."

However, having access to so much information makes it difficult for users to easily find the information they seek. Users want a visualized system that reduces information retrieval and learning time, saving them from personally reading and judging all available information. As a result, recommendation systems are an increasingly important technologies that are essential to the business.  Collaborative filtering is used in various fields with excellent performance because recommendations are made based on similar user interests and preferences. However, limitations do exist. Sparsity occurs when user-item preference information is insufficient, and is the main limitation of collaborative filtering. The evaluation value of the user item matrix may be distorted by the data depending on the popularity of the product, or there may be new users who have not yet evaluated the value. The lack of historical data to identify consumer preferences is referred to as data sparsity, and various methods have been studied to address these problems. However, most attempts to solve the sparsity problem are not optimal because they can only be applied when additional data such as users personal information, social networks, or characteristics of items are included.  Another problem is that real-world score data are mostly biased to high scores, resulting in severe imbalances. One cause of this imbalance distribution is the purchasing bias, in which only users with high product ratings purchase products, so those with low ratings are less likely to purchase products and thus do not leave negative product reviews. Due to these characteristics, unlike most users actual preferences, reviews by users who purchase products are more likely to be positive. Therefore, the actual rating data is over-learned in many classes with high incidence due to its biased characteristics, distorting the market. Applying collaborative filtering to these imbalanced data leads to poor recommendation performance due to excessive learning of biased classes.  Traditional oversampling techniques to address this problem are likely to cause overfitting because they repeat the same data, which acts as noise in learning, reducing recommendation performance. In addition, pre-processing methods for most existing data imbalance problems are designed and used for binary classes. Binary class imbalance techniques are difficult to apply to multi-class problems because they cannot model multi-class problems, such as objects at cross-class boundaries or objects overlapping multiple classes.  To solve this problem, research has been conducted to convert and apply multi-class problems to binary class problems. However, simplification of multi-class problems can cause potential classification errors when combined with the results of classifiers learned from other sub-problems, resulting in loss of important information about relationships beyond the selected items. Therefore, it is necessary to develop more effective methods to address multi-class imbalance problems.  We propose a collaborative filtering model using CGAN to generate realistic virtual data to populate the empty user-item matrix. Conditional vector y identify distributions for minority classes and generate data reflecting their characteristics. Collaborative filtering then maximizes the performance of the recommendation system via hyperparameter tuning. This process should improve the accuracy of the model by addressing the sparsity problem of collaborative filtering implementations while mitigating data imbalances arising from real data. Our model has superior recommendation performance over existing oversampling techniques and existing real-world data with data sparsity. SMOTE, Borderline SMOTE, SVM-SMOTE, ADASYN, and GAN were used as comparative models and we demonstrate the highest prediction accur"

Most traditional detection methods are based on static analysis with signature matching and dynamic analysis methods that are focused on sensitive behaviors. However, the usual detections have only limited effect when meeting the development of malware, so that the manual update for feature sets is essential. Besides, most of these methods match target samples with the usual feature database, which ignored the characteristics of the sample itself. In this paper, we propose a new malware detection method that could combine the features of a single sample and the general features of malware. Firstly, a structure of Directed Cyclic Graph (DCG) is adopted to extract features from samples. Then the sensitivity of each API call is computed with Markov Chain. Afterward, the graph is merged with the chain to get the final features. Finally, the detectors based on machine learning or deep learning are devised for identification. To evaluate the effect and robustness of our approach, several experiments were adopted. The results showed that the proposed method had a good performance in most tests, and the approach also had stability with the development and growth of malware."

DNN-Based Brain MRI Classification Using Fuzzy Clustering and Autoencoder Features,2021,"['Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)', 'Fuzzy c-mean (FCM) clustering', 'Deep neural network', 'Autoencoder', 'Classification']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Worldwide interest has been noted in medical image analysis and classification using machine learning techniques. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the safe and painless procedures for human brain scanning. During the MRI procedure, magnetic fields and radio waves are used to scan and map the extended view of brain tissues for further pathological processes and analysis. For a qualitative and quantitative MRI analysis, the manual capability of radiologists and/or doctors is limited and time-consuming in complex and group-level diagnoses. Hence, the development of an intelligent, robust, and reliable support system for the diagnosis of brain-related diseases is a top priority. In this paper, a new deep neural network based MRI image classification approach is proposed that uses fuzzy c-mean (FCM) and an autoencoder to classify brain MRI as normal or abnormal, diminishing human error during the diagnosis of diseases in MRI scans. Here, FCM is utilized for abnormal tissue segmentation from brain MRI images, followed by an autoencoder, for extraction and dimensionality reduction of features. Finally, a deep neural network was used for the classification of brain MRI images that were trained using FCM-extracted features and sample data. Considering the availability of raw MRI data, data augmentation techniques have also been used to increase the number of data required to train a deep neural network. The experiment results achieved 96% accuracy and a 95% sensitivity rate for classification. The results demonstrate that the proposed well-trained deep learning technology has the potential to make solid predictions regarding brain abnormalities; therefore, it can be used as a prominent tool in clinical practice."

This temperature rise causes changes in fishery resources and affects leisure activities such as fishing. In particular, high temperatures lead to the occurrence of red tides, causing severe damage to ocean industries such as aquaculture. Meanwhile, changes in sea temperature are closely related to military operation to detect submarines. This is because the degree of diffraction, refraction, or reflection of sound waves used to detect submarines varies depending on the ocean mixed layer. Currently, research on the prediction of changes in sea water temperature is being actively conducted. However, existing research is focused on predicting only the surface temperature of the ocean, so it is difficult to identify fishery resources according to depth and apply them to military operations such as submarine detection. Therefore, in this study, we predicted the temperature of the ocean mixed layer at a depth of 38m by using temperature data for each water depth in the upper mixed layer and meteorological data such as temperature, atmospheric pressure, and sunlight that are related to the surface temperature. The data used are meteorological data and sea temperature data by water depth observed from 2016 to 2020 at the IEODO Ocean Research Station. In order to increase the accuracy and efficiency of prediction, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), which is known to be suitable for time series data among deep learning techniques, was used. As a result of the experiment, in the daily prediction, the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of the model using temperature, atmospheric pressure, and sunlight data together was 0.473. On the other hand, the RMSE of the model using only the surface temperature was 0.631.

In particular, text data has been a means of expressing human opinion for a long time, and the demand and necessity for text analysis are continuously increasing in various fields. Recently, models such as the ELMo (embeddings from language model), GPT (generating pre-training of a language model), BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformation) have been developed that combine deep learning, which is showing excellent performance in various fields, and the word embedding method that semantically vectorizes text.

However, BERT specialized in 'English' and plain text, such as social media data, does not implement optimal performance in specialized texts such as 'Korean' or 'R&D documents, intellectual property documents', so it can achieve optimal performance through optimization such as learning specialized corpus. Therefore, In this study, in order to develop a BERT specialized in the field of Korean trademarks, a tokenizer model specialized in trademark-related professional documents was learned using a text corpus for rejection in the trademark opinion submission notice and used for BERT. The classification accuracy of the proposed model was 96.89%, which is 4.97% higher than the classification accuracy performance of the existing multilingual BERT model. The results showed that BERT, which showed high performance in the field of natural language, could show high classification accuracy even in corpus data composed of specialized terms."

Deep learning enables the variety and accuracy of LPR to be good, but ir reauires high-performance graphic cards and very long time processing time. In order to get around the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches, this paper proposes a light-weight vehicle license plate recognition system that can be processed in real time even using an embedded board or a general office PC without graphic cards.

Inertial Navigation System (INS) and Global Positioning System (GPS) are used for collecting location information and for controlling the USV with DDQN-AM algorithm. Conventional probability-based filters such as Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) are suitable for estimating behaviors of nonlinear systems and have been widely applied for localizing various kinds of nonlinear vehicles. However, the algorithms diverge or linearization position error increases in localizing USVs that are required to follow a desired trajectory accurately under high wave and wind conditions. Also, computational complexity is very high, which causes the instability of the vehicle system. To address these problems, DDQN with Adam optimization for error back propagation have been adopted in this research. However, if learning is performed using the training data set of the current time (current state, reward, action) in the replay buffer of DDQN, the learning performance (accuracy for states and running time) may deteriorate and learning load may occur. therefore, to improve the learning performance of DDQN, DDQN-AM has been newly proposed by adding AM in this research. To verify the effectiveness and to show the superior learning performance of the proposed DDQN-AM against the conventional approaches, a simulation using Matlab and field experiments with a prototype USV have been performed at the seashore. As a result, the position error of DDQN-AM was improved by 57.6% compared to the existing approach, and the average running time was also shortened by 1 minute, 30 seconds."

With the recent development of deep learning, various studies are being conducted to classify objects around vehicles. In object recognition based on deep learning, there are a point cloud-based model1 and an image-based model2. The image-based model has a sensitive limitation to the light and weather of the camera sensor. On the other hand, since the LiDAR sensor is relatively less affected by light and weather, the reliability of the point cloud-based model is higher. However, the data in the point cloud has a non-uniform distribution. This causes information loss in the convolution process and uses a method of processing a point cloud as a graph to effectively process it. In this paper, after making a graph using a point cloud as a node, we apply a Graph Attention Network (GAT) that uses an attention mechanism to learn by assigning weights to important nodes to encode the characteristics of each node. This information is used to classify the object and predict the bounding box through two Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). As a result, the loss of node characteristic information is prevented by giving weight to the information of the target node and the neighboring nodes that are highly relevant."

Since the southern coastal region of the Korean peninsula was originally dominated by warm-temperate evergreen broad-leaved forests, it is desirable to restore forests in this region to their original vegetation. In this study, we identified suitable areas to be restored as evergreen broad-leaved forests by analyzing the environmental factors of existing evergreen broad-leaved forests in the islands of Jeollanam-do. We classified forest lands in the study area into six vegetation types from Sentinel-2 satellite images using a deep learning algorithm and analyzed the tolerance ranges of existing evergreen broad-leaved forests by measuring the locational, topographic, and climatic attributes of the classified vegetation types. Results showed that evergreen broad-leaved forests were distributed more in areas with a high altitudes and steep slope, where human intervention was relatively low. The human intervention has led to a higher distribution of evergreen broad-leaved forests in areas with lower annual average temperature, which was an unexpected but understandable result because an area with higher altitude has a lower temperature. Of the environmental factors, latitude and average temperature in the coldest month (January) were relatively less contaminated by the effects of human intervention, thus enabling the identification of suitable restoration areas of the evergreen broad-leaved forests. The tolerance range analysis of evergreen broad-leaved forests showed that they mainly grew in areas south of the latitude of 34.7° and a monthly average temperature of 1.7°C or higher in the coldest month. Therefore, we predicted the areas meeting these criteria to be suitable for restoring evergreen broad-leaved forests. The suitable areas cover 614.5 ㎢, which occupies 59.0% of the total forest lands on the islands of Jeollanamdo, and 73% of actual forests that exclude agricultural and other non-restorable forest lands.

The recommendation system recommends information and content (music, movies, books, images, etc.) that a specific user may be interested in. It is already widely used in services where it is important to consider individual tendencies such as YouTube and Facebook, and you can experience it familiarly in providing personalized services in content services such as over-the-top media services (OTT). Classes are also a kind of content consumption in terms of selecting classes suitable for individuals from a set content list. However, unlike other content consumption, it is characterized by a large influence of selection results. For example, in the case of music and movies, it is usually consumed once and the time required to consume content is short. Therefore, the importance of each item is relatively low, and there is no deep concern in selecting. Major classes usually have a long consumption time because they have to be taken for one semester, and each item has a high importance and requires greater caution in choice because it affects many things such as career and graduation requirements depending on the composition of the selected classes. Depending on the unique characteristics of these major classes, the recommendation system in the education field supports decision-making that reflects individual characteristics that are meaningful and cannot be reflected in experience-based decision-making, even though it has a relatively small number of item ranges. This study aims to realize personalized education and enhance students educational satisfaction by presenting a recommendation model for university major class. In the model study, class history data of undergraduate students at University from 2015 to 2017 were used, and students and their major names were used as metadata. The class history data is implicit feedback data that only indicates whether content is consumed, not reflecting preferences for classes. Therefore, when we derive embedding vectors that characterize students and classes, their expressive power is low. With these issues in mind, this study proposes a Net-NeuMF model that generates vectors of students, classes through network analysis and utilizes them as input values of the model. The model was based on the structure of NeuMF using one-hot vectors, a representative model using data with implicit feedback. The input vectors of the model are generated to represent the characteristic of students and classes through network analysis. To generate a vector representing a student, each student is set to a node and the edge is designed to connect with a weight if the two students take the same class. Similarly, to generate a vector representing the class, each class was set as a node, and the edge connected if any students had taken the classes in common. Thus, we utilize Node2Vec, a representation learning methodology that quantifies the charac"
Developing Sentimental Analysis System Based on Various Optimizer,2021,"['Sentimental analysis', 'Natural language processing', 'Optimizer', 'Word embedding']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Over the past few decades, natural language processing research has not made much. However, the widespread use of deep learning and neural networks attracted attention for the application of neural networks in natural language processing. Sentiment analysis is one of the challenges of natural language processing. Emotions are things that a person thinks and feels. Therefore, sentiment analysis should be able to analyze the person’s attitude, opinions, and inclinations in text or actual text. In the case of emotion analysis, it is a priority to simply classify two emotions: positive and negative. In this paper we propose the deep learning based sentimental analysis system according to various optimizer that is SGD, ADAM and RMSProp. Through experimental result RMSprop optimizer shows the best performance compared to others on IMDB data set. Future work is to find more best hyper parameter for sentimental analysis system."

In this research, the two different methods such as image classification and image segmentation were compared for mapping the rural road based on the given high-resolution satellite image acquired in the rural areas. In the image classification method, the deep learning with the multiple neural networks was employed to the given high-resolution satellite image for generating the object classification map, then the rural roads were mapped by extracting the road objects from the generated object classification map. In the image segmentation method, the multiresolution segmentation was employed to the same satellite image for generating the segment image, then the rural roads were mapped by merging the road objects located on the rural roads on the satellite image. We used the 100 checkpoints for assessing the accuracy of the two rural roads mapped by the different methods and drew the following conclusions. The image segmentation method had the better performance than the image classification method for mapping the rural roads using the give satellite image, because some of the rural roads mapped by the image classification method were not identified due to the miclassification errors occurred in the object classification map, while all of the rural roads mapped by the image segmentation method were identified. However some of the rural roads mapped by the image segmentation method also had the miclassfication errors due to some rural road segments including the non-rural road objects.

The flood forecasting model based on ANNs was designed to predict real-time runoff for 1 to 6-h lead time using the rainfall and runoff data of the past nine hours. The statistical measures such as R<sup>2</sup>, Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), the error of peak time (ETp), and the error of peak discharge (EQp) were used to evaluate the model accuracy. The tanh and ELU functions were most accurate with R<sup>2</sup>=0.97 and RMSE=30.1 (m<sup>3</sup>/s) for 1-h lead time and R<sup>2</sup>=0.56 and RMSE=124.6∼124.8 (m<sup>3</sup>/s) for 6-h lead time. We also evaluated the learning speed by using the number of epochs that minimizes errors. The sigmoid function had the slowest learning speed due to the ‘vanishing gradient problem’ and the limited direction of weight update. The learning speed of the ELU function was 1.2 times faster than the tanh function. As a result, the ELU function most effectively improved the accuracy and speed of the ANNs model, so it was determined to be the best activation function for ANNs-based flood forecasting."

FI-HCNN consists of a fault diagnosis part and a severity estimation part, arranged hierarchically. The main novelty of the proposed FI-HCNN is the special inherited structure between the hierarchy; the severity estimation part utilizes the latent features to exploit the fault-related representations in the fault diagnosis task. FI-HCNN can improve the accuracy of the fault severity estimation because the level-specific abstraction is supported by the latent features. Also, FI-HCNN has ease in practical application because it is developed based on stator current signals which are usually acquired for a control purpose.

Medical imaging is rapidly taking a predominant position for the diagnosis and treatment of lower back abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a primary tool for detecting anatomical and functional abnormalities in the intervertebral disc (IVD) and provides valuable data for both diagnosis and research. Deep learning methods perform well in computer visioning when labeled general image training data are abundant. In the practice of medical images, the labeled data or the segmentation data are produced manually. However, manual medical image segmentation leads to two main issues: much time is needed for delineation, and reproducibility is called into question. To handle this problem, we developed an automated approach for IVD instance segmentation that can utilize T1 and T2 images during this study to handle data limitation problems and computational time problems and improve the generalization of the algorithm. This method builds upon mask-RCNN; we proposed a multistage optimization mask-RCNN (MOM-RCNN) for deep learning segmentation networks. We used a multi-optimization training system by utilizing stochastic gradient descent and adaptive moment estimation (Adam) with T1 and T2 in MOM-RCNN. The proposed method showed a significant improvement in processing time and segmentation results compared to previous commonly used segmentation methods. We evaluated the results using several different key performance measures. We obtain the Dice coefficient (99%). Our method can define the IVD’s segmentation as much as 88% (sensitivity) and recognize the non-IVD as much as 98% (specificity). The results also obtained increasing precision (92%) with a low global consistency error (0.03), approaching 0 (the best possible score).

License plate data needs to be balanced from past license plates to the latest license plates. However, it is difficult to obtain data from the actual past license plate to the latest ones. In order to solve this problem, a license plate recognition study through deep learning is being conducted by creating a synthetic license plates. Since the synthetic data have differences from real data, and various data augmentation techniques are used to solve these problems. Existing data augmentation simply used methods such as brightness, rotation, affine transformation, blur, and noise. In this paper, we apply a style transformation method that transforms synthetic data into real-world data styles with data augmentation methods. In addition, real license plate data are noisy when it is captured from a distance and under the dark environment. If we simply recognize characters with input data, chances of misrecognition are high. To improve character recognition, in this paper, we applied the DeblurGANv2 method as a quality improvement method for character recognition, increasing the accuracy of license plate recognition. The method of deep learning for license plate detection and license plate number recognition used YOLO-V5. To determine the performance of the synthetic license plate data, we construct a test set by collecting our own secured license plates. License plate detection without style conversion recorded 0.614 mAP. As a result of applying the style transformation, we confirm that the license plate detection performance was improved by recording 0.679mAP. In addition, the successul detection rate without image enhancement was 0.872, and the detection rate was 0.915 after image enhancement, confirming that the performance improved."

Since the original pure pursuit works well only at speeds below 20 km/h, the look-ahead distance is implemented as a sigmoid function to work well at an average speed of 45 km/h to improve tracking performance. In addition, a smoothing filter was added to reduce the steering angle vibration of the original algorithm, and the stability of the steering angle was improved. The post-processing algorithm presented has implemented more robust lane recognition system using real-time pre/post processing method with deep learning and estimated interpolation. Real time processing is more cost-effective than the method using lots of computing resources and building abundant datasets for improving the performance of deep learning networks. Therefore, this paper also presents improved lane detection performance by using the final results with naive computer vision codes and pre/post processing. Firstly, the pre-processing was newly designed for real-time processing and robust recognition performance of augmentation. Secondly, the post-processing was designed to detect lanes by receiving the segmentation results based on the estimated interpolation in consideration of the properties of the continuous lanes.

In comparison with the work to design deep learning models, preparing datasets is a long haul; at the moment, in the domain of vision intelligent, datasets are still being made by handwork requiring a lot of time and efforts, where workers need to directly make labels on each image usually with GUI-based labeling tools. In this paper, we overview the current status of vision datasets focusing on what datasets are being shared and how they are prepared with various labeling tools. Particularly, in order to relieve the repetitive and tiring labeling work, we present an interactive smart image annotating system with which the annotation work can be transformed from the direct human-only manual labeling to a correction-after-checking by means of a support of automatic labeling. In an experiment, we show that automatic labeling can greatly improve the productivity of datasets especially reducing time and efforts to specify regions of objects found in images. Finally, we discuss critical issues that we faced in the experiment to our annotation system and describe future work to raise the productivity of image datasets creation for accelerating AI technology."

However, there are cases in which it is difficult to secure more than a certain amount of flight vehicle trajectory data for various reasons. In such cases, synthetic data generation could be one way to make machine learning possible. In this paper, to explore this possibility, we generated and evaluated synthetic flight vehicle trajectory data using time-series generative adversarial neural network.

The proposed technique has the following originality. The first is to extract feature points and use them to generate local patches to enable faster computation by learning and using only local patches that are more useful than the surroundings without learning the entire image. Second, learning is performed through deep learning using the convolution neural network structure to improve accuracy by reducing the error rate. Third, unlike the existing feature point matching technique, it enables indoor location measurement including left and right movement. Fourth, since the indoor location is newly measured every frame, errors occurring in the front side during movement are prevented from accumulating. Therefore, it has the advantage that the error between the final arrival point and the predicted indoor location does not increase even if the moving distance increases. As a result of the experiment conducted to evaluate the time required and accuracy of the measurement technique of indoor location based on markerless applicable to AR proposed in this paper, the difference between the actual indoor location and the measured indoor location is an average of 12.8㎝ and a maximum of 21.2㎝.

Through this, national consensus was formed and the group's belief system in favor of introducing telemedicine was strengthened. This dynamic movement of the policy subsystem led to the emergence of the National Assembly as a policy broker, and policy changes occurred when National Assembly revise the Infectious Disease Prevention Act.Unlike before, when science and technology policies were considered a specialized area and unilaterally introduced by political decisions or political leaders, the introduction of new technologies and new services required support from members of society through consensus with the people.

COMPAS의 도입･시행 이후, 이 알고리즘을 둘러싼 논란과 여러 비판에서 보듯 미국에서 널리 사용되고 있는 COMPAS는 인종차별적인 결과를 내는 등 문제점이 많은 것으로 드러났다. 인공지능의 블랙박스 속성 때문에 COMPAS의 작동 기제를 알지 못한다. 편향적 결과로 인해 피해를 본 사람도 이와 같은 블랙박스 속성 때문에 그 결과를 탄핵할 수 없다. 이러한 블랙박스로 인한 인공지능 알고리즘의 문제점을 해결하려는 해법이 필요하다. 그 해법의 가장 큰 줄기가 바로 ‘설명 가능한 인공지능’이다. 설명가능 인공지능은 인공지능이 내린 의사결정의 이유를 사람이 이해할 수 있는 방식으로 제시하는 인공지능을 일컫는다. 인공지능의 발전에 상당한 기여를 했다는 평가를 받고 있는 미 방위고등연구계획국은 몇 년 전부터 이러한 설명 가능한 인공지능 연구에 대해 막대한 지원을 하고 있다.물론 인공지능 연구자 중에는 설명 가능한 인공지능의 가치에 대해 의문을 던지고 있는 이도 있다. 심지어 인간의 의사결정과정도 쉽게 설명될 수 있는 것이 아니라며, 인공지능의 의사결정 과정의 설명 가능성과 실용성 모두를 의문시한다. 이런 회의론 에도 불구하고, 법 분야에서 인간의 의사결정을 대체하는 수준의 인공지능 알고리즘이 개발되고, 자리 잡기 위해서는 설명 가능한 인공지능 과제는 반드시 해결되어야 한다. 따라서 본 연구에서는 이러한 설명 가능한 인공지능의 개념과 그것이 법 분야 인공지능 알고리즘 구현과 활용에 얼마나 중요한지를 따져보고, 그것의 실현가능성을 점쳐 본다.이런 설명 가능한 인공지능으로 인하여 편향성이나 차별 등 공정성 가치를 저해하는 등 여러 가지 문제점이 해결될 것으로 기대한다.","Artificial intelligence, in particular, machine learning algorithms are used not only in the medical field or finance field, but also in the law field to predict the risk of recidivism, predict crime, and improve legal services. The most problematic aspect of such artificial intelligence is the black box problem, which is that humans do not properly understand the mechanism of operation of artificial intelligence. The inner workings of deep learning or machine learning architectures are becoming increasingly complex and opaque. As is the case in other fields, in the field of law, a system is essential to ensure transparency in the decision-making process of artificial intelligence, and to explain the decision-making process to non-experts. Decision-making in the field of law is because not only the outcome, but also its procedural justification is very important. The recidivism risk prediction algorithm COMPAS, which is mentioned as a representative case of decision-making algorithms in the legal field, is used for determining whether to release a defendant or determining a sentence. Since the introduction and implementation of COMPAS, as seen in the controversy and criticisms surrounding this algorithm, COMPAS, which is widely used in the United States, has been found to have many problems, such as racist results. Due to the black box nature of artificial intelligence, we do not know the mechanism of COMPAS. Even those who have suffered damage due to the biased result cannot challenge the result because of the black box property. There is a need for a solution to solve the problem of artificial intelligence algorithms caused by such black boxes. The biggest stem of the solution is ‘explainable artificial intelligence'. Explainable artificial intelligence refers to artificial intelligence that presents the reasons for decisions made by artificial intelligence in a way that humans can understand. The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa), which is considered to have made a significant contribution to the advancement of artificial intelligence, began to provide enormous support for such explanatory artificial intelligence research several years ago.Of course, some of the AI researchers are questioning the value of explainable AI. Even the human decision-making process cannot be explained easily, and they question both the explanatory feasibility and practicality of the decision-making process of artificial intelligence. Despite this skepticism, in order to develop and establish an artificial intelligence algorithm at a level that replaces human decision-making in the field of law, an explainable AI task must be solved. Therefore, in this study, the concept of explainable artificial intelligence and how important it is to the implementation and application of artificial intelligence algorithms in the legal field, and its feasibility are examined.It is expected that a large number of problems that hinder fairness values such as bias and discrimination will be solved by such explainable artificial intelligence.

ABC[5], an existing representative supervised anomalies detection method, generates blur images for normal data, and the distribution of reconstruction errors for normal and abnormal overlaps considerably. In order to solve these problems, we proposed an improved anomaly detection method using autoencoder and GAN. The proposed method combine various loss functions of both supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection utilizing both normal and abnormal training data. We demonstrate the proposed GAN based anomaly detection by performing experiments on Fashion-MNIST, and real-world industrial dataset – metal surface defects. Compared to ABC[5], our model is superior to the previous approach in terms of average area under the ROC curve (AUROC) and distribution of the reconstruction errors for normal and anomaly data."

Weight quantization, which lowers bit precision of weights, is a lightweight method that enables a model to be used through integer calculation in a mobile environment where GPU acceleration is unable. Weight quantization has already been used in various models as a lightweight method to reduce computational complexity and model size with a small loss of accuracy. Considering the size of memory and computing speed as well as the storage size of the device and the limited network environment, this paper proposes a method of compressing integer weights after quantization using a video codec as a method. To verify the performance of the proposed method, experiments were conducted on VGG16, Resnet50, and Resnet18 models trained with ImageNet and Places365 datasets. As a result, loss of accuracy less than 2% and high compression efficiency were achieved in various models. In addition, as a result of comparison with similar compression methods, it was verified that the compression efficiency was more than doubled."

Background: 최근 전동킥보드 사용량이 급증함에 따라 안전사고도 증가하고 있다. 이에 정부는 헬멧 착용을 의무화하도록 도로교통법을 개정했으나, 헬멧 착용자는 16%에 불과한 상황이며 단속과 처벌 또한 어려운 상황이다. CCTV를 통한 단속을 진행한다고 하더라도 즉각적으로 제재하는 데 어려움이 있기 때문에 헬멧 미착용 시 사용자에게 즉각적인 규제를 적용할 수 있고 헬멧 착용률도 향상시킬 수 있는 새로운 방법이 필요한 상황이다. Method: 킥보드의 넥 중앙부에 얼굴을 올려다보는 각도로 스마트폰을 설치하고 주행 장면을 촬영하여 2,400장의 이미지를 수집하였다. 총 6명의 사용자를 대상으로 주간에 평평한 지형에서 촬영을 진행하였으며, 사용자별로 헬멧 착용 이미지, 헬멧 미착용 이미지를 각각 200장씩 수집하였다. 객체 인식을 위한 딥러닝 모델인 Faster-R-CNN, YOLOv3, DETR, Deformable DETR을 이용하여 30/100epoch 동안 학습을 진행하여 헬멧 착용 여부 판별 결과를 도출하였다. 딥러닝 학습 시, 학습 데이터는 1,680장, 검증 데이터는 240장, 테스트 데이터는 480장을 이용하였다. Results: 30 epoch 동안 학습을 진행한 경우 Faster-R-CNN, YOLOv3-320, YOLOv3-416, YOLOv3-608, DETR, Deformable DETR의 mAP는 각각 0.9, 0.693, 0.631, 0.38, 0.853, 0.879로 나타났다. 한편, 100 epoch 동안 학습한 경우, mAP는 각각 0.899, 0.785, 0.819, 0.783, 0.882, 0.905로 변화하였다.

Conclusion: 본 연구에서 제안한 환경에서 다양한 딥러닝 기반 객체 인식 모델들이 0.78 이상의 ㎃P를 보이며 주행 중 사용자 헬멧 착용 여부 감지 가능성을 확인할 수 있었다. 반면, 사용자 정면에서 촬영된 공개 헬멧 데이터만을 이용하여 학습한 모델의 경우 헬멧 착용 여부 판별에 한계가 있음을 알 수 있었다.

In this work, we address these challenges equipped with the promising results of Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) in classification tasks.

Wasserstein distance with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) was adopted to stabilize training and avoid gradient vanishing phenomena. Finally, we conducted various experiments on two open-source benchmarks namely: RSSCN7 and Kaggle datasets, to systematically evaluate the proposed framework performance. According to the obtained results, the proposed approach excels other approaches quantitatively and visually. Quantitatively, the results show a boost by a considerable margin of 2%, and 3% in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), respectively.

Therefore, it is necessary to find an effective method to prevent the damage to rice yield and pre-harvest sprouting through early detection. This paper proposes an estimation method for rice lodging based on RGB images captured by unmanned aviation vehicles. The proposed method constructs the DeepLabV3+ semantic segmentation model based on ResNetV2 101 backbone network and estimates the area of lodging, non-lodging, and background. To train and evaluate the proposed model, we captured 816 images related to rice lodging using an unmanned aerial vehicle in Gyeongsang-do, Jeolla-do, and Chungcheong-do. The collected dataset was divided into 748 training data, 40 validation data, and 28 evaluation data, which were then used in various methods such as transfer learning and focal loss function for the improved estimation performance. The evaluation of performance using 28 evaluation data shows that the DeepLab V3+ semantic segmentation model, to which the focal loss function was applied, yields the best results with 93.16% pixel accuracy and 87.75% mIoU. Furthermore, the estimation result can be used to find the distribution of lodging and non-lodging and analyze the trend of spreading lodging, damage, and shape."

BERGPT-chatbot은 KR-BERT와 KoGPT2-chatbot을 파이프라인으로 만들어 감정 완화 챗봇을 모델링하였다. KR-BERT를 통해 정제되지 않은 일상 데이터셋에 감정을 부여하고, 추가 데이터셋을 KoGPT2-chatbot을 통해 학습하는 방식이다. BERGPT-chatbot의 개발 배경은 다음과 같다. 현재 전 세계적으로 우울증 환자가 증가하고 있으며, 이는 COVID-19로 인해 장기적 실내 생활이나 대인 관계 제한으로 더욱 심각한 문제로 대두되었다. 그로 인해 부정적 감정 완화나 정신 건강 케어에 목적을 둔 국외의 인공지능 챗봇이 팬데믹 사태로 사용량이 증가하였다. 국내에서도 국외의 챗봇과 비슷한 심리 진단 챗봇이 서비스 되고 있으나, 국내의 챗봇은 텍스트 입력 기반 답변이 아닌 버튼형 답변 중심으로 국외 챗봇과 비교하였을 때 심리 진단 수준에 그쳐 아쉬운 실정이다. 따라서, BERGPT-chatbot을 통해 감정 완화에 도움을 주는 챗봇을 제안하였으며, BERGPT-chatbot과 KoGPT2-chatbot을 언어 모델의 내부 평가 지표인 ‘퍼플렉서티’를 통해 비교 분석하여 BERGPT-chatbot의 우수함을 보여주고자 한다.","In this paper, we propose a BERGPT-chatbot, a domestic AI chatbot that can alleviate negative emotions based on text input such as ‘Replika’. We made BERGPT-chatbot into a chatbot capable of mitigating negative emotions by pipelined two models, KR-BERT and KoGPT2-chatbot. We applied a creative method of giving emotions to unrefined everyday datasets through KR-BERT, and learning additional datasets through KoGPT2-chatbot. The development background of BERGPT-chatbot is as follows. Currently, the number of people with depression is increasing all over the world. This phenomenon is emerging as a more serious problem due to COVID-19, which causes people to increase long-term indoor living or limit interpersonal relationships. Overseas artificial intelligence chatbots aimed at relieving negative emotions or taking care of mental health care, have increased in use due to the pandemic. In Korea, Psychological diagnosis chatbots similar to those of overseas cases are being operated. However, as the domestic chatbot is a system that outputs a button-based answer rather than a text input-based answer, when compared to overseas chatbots, domestic chatbots remain at a low level of diagnosing human psychology. Therefore, we proposed a chatbot that helps mitigating negative emotions through BERGPT-chatbot. Finally, we compared BERGPT-chatbot and KoGPT2-chatbot through ‘Perplexity’, an internal evaluation metric for evaluating language models, and showed the superity of BERGPT-chatbot."

(1) 모델 재학습 방법; (2) 입력 변환 방법; (3) 적대적 예제 탐지 방법. 이러한 적대적 예제에 대응하기 위한 방법은 끊임없이 등장하고 있지만 각 적대적 공격 유형을 분류하는 연구는 미비한 실정이다. 따라서, 본 논문에서는 차원 축소와 군집화 알고리즘을 활용한 적대적 공격 유형 분류 방법을 제안한다. 구체적으로, 제안하는 방법은 적대적 예시로부터 적대적 섭동을 추출하고 선형 판별 분석(LDA)를 통해 적대적 섭동의 차원을 축소한 후에 k-means 알고리즘으로 적대적 공격 유형 분류를 수행한다. MNIST 데이터셋과 CIFAR-10 데이터셋을 대상으로 한 실험을 통해, 제안하는 기법은 5개의 적대적 공격(FGSM, BIM, PGD, DeepFool, C&W)을 효율적으로 분류할 수 있으며, 적대적 예제에 대한 정상 입력을 알 수 없는 제한적인 상황에서도 우수한 분류 성능을 나타내는 것을 확인하였다.","Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have shown impressive performance in various fields, they are vulnerable to adversarial examples which induce misclassification by adding human-imperceptible perturbations to the input. Previous studies to defend the adversarial examples can be classified into three categories: (1) model retraining methods; (2) input transformation methods; and (3) adversarial examples detection methods. However, even though the defense methods against adversarial examples have constantly been proposed, there is no research to classify the type of adversarial attack. In this paper, we proposed an adversarial attack family classification method based on dimensionality reduction and clustering. Specifically, after extracting adversarial perturbation from adversarial example, we performed Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce the dimensionality of adversarial perturbation and performed K-means algorithm to classify the type of adversarial attack family. From the experimental results using MNIST dataset and CIFAR-10 dataset, we show that the proposed method can efficiently classify five tyeps of adversarial attack(FGSM, BIM, PGD, DeepFool, C&W). We also show that the proposed method provides good classification performance even in a situation where the legitimate input to the adversarial example is unknown."

Moreover, because industrial information is continuously accumulating while the machine is running, it has a much longer sequence than other sequential data. In this study, we compare the performance of widely used natural language models, LSTM and Transformer, on such long-time series industrial data. For comparison, we performed experiments to detect an attack on a water treatment management system and to predict traffic flow on a highway.

Interpolation based Single-path Sub-pixel Convolution for Super-Resolution Multi-Scale Networks,2021,"['Super-resolution', 'multi-scalable network', 'multi-scale single-path Super-resolution']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Deep leaning convolutional neural networks (CNN) have successfully been applied to image super-resolution (SR). Despite their great performances, SR techniques tend to focus on a certain upscale factor when training a particular model. Algorithms for single model multi-scale networks can easily be constructed if images are upscaled prior to input, but sub-pixel convolution upsampling works differently for each scale factor. Recent SR methods employ multi-scale and multi-path learning as a solution. However, this causes unshared parameters and unbalanced parameter distribution across various scale factors. We present a multi-scale single-path upsample module as a solution by exploiting the advantages of sub-pixel convolution and interpolation algorithms. The proposed model employs sub-pixel convolution for the highest scale factor among the learning upscale factors, and then utilize 1-dimension interpolation, compressing the learned features on the channel axis to match the desired output image size. Experiments are performed for the single-path upsample module, and compared to the multi-path upsample module. Based on the experimental results, the proposed algorithm reduces the upsample module's parameters by 24% and presents slightly to better performance compared to the previous algorithm."

Background: 이펙터는 전자 기타에 연결해 음의 파형에 변화를 주어 소리를 변조시키는 장치이다. 시중에는 다양한 종류의 이펙터가 존재하고 같은 종류의 이펙터라 하더라도 변조의 정도가 다르다는 점 때문에 대부분의 초/중급 연주자에게는 많은 비용과 시간을 들여 이펙터를 구매하고 기능과 조합을 학습해야 한다는 어려움이 존재한다. Method: 이펙터를 Filter, Time, Drive, Modulation 총 4가지 계열로 분류한 뒤, Filter계열은 wah. Time계열은 reverb, delay. Drive계열은 overdrive, distortion, fuzz. Modulation계열은 chorus, phaser, flanger, tremolo로 총 11개의 이펙터를 선정했다. 학습 및 실험에 사용하기 위한 음원 데이터는 Sonar사의 Cakewalk DAW와 TH3 전자 기타 VSTi를 활용해 수집했다. 데이터 세트는 0옥타브 도부터 3옥타브 도까지 22개의 단일음을 4초씩 연주한 44K 단음 데이터와 약 8분 45초 길이의 Canon Rock 연주음 데이터를 4초씩 분할한 44K 복합음 데이터로 구성되어 있다. 데이터 전처리를 수행한 후, 2640개의 각 계열별 단일음 샘플과 15720개의 복합음 샘플, 총 18360개의 샘플을 계열별 이펙터 분류 모델 훈련에 사용하였다. 음원에 적용된 각 계열별 이펙터를 분류하기 위하여 음원 데이터 분석을 위한 딥러닝 모델인 PANNs 신경망을 사용하였다. 각각의 이펙터 계열 분류를 위하여 4개의 개별 모델을 병렬적으로 학습하였다. 각 계열별로 이펙터가 사용되지 않은 상태의 음원까지 포함하여 10epoch 동안 학습을 진행했고 10-fold Cross Validation 결과, 모두 99%이상의 정확도를 기록했다. 각 모델의 일반화 성능을 평가하기 위해 추가적으로 1분 3초 길이의 신규 음원을 4초씩 분할한 1800개의 연주음 데이터 세트를 구성해 최종적인 모델 평가를 진행했다. Result: 모델 평가 결과, 학습 과정에 포함되지 않았던 신규 음원에 대하여 Filter계열은 97%, Time계열은 80%, Drive계열은 82%, Modulation계열은 82%의 정확도로 이펙터의 종류를 분류해냈다. 이진 분류인 Filter계열은 높은 정확도를 기록했고, Time계열은 delay이펙터, Drive계열은 fuzz이펙터, Modulation계열은 chorus이펙터에 약세를 보였다. 해당 이펙터에 대한 추가 학습을 진행하면 정확도를 더 높일 수 있을 것으로 기대된다.

Hence, multispectral MRI modalities are used for characterizingthe properties of brain tissues. Traditional lesion detection methods rely on extracting significant hand-engineeredfeatures to differentiate normal and abnormal brain tissues. But the identification of those discriminating features is quitecomplex, as the degree of differentiation varies according to each modality. This can be addressed well by ConvolutionalNeural Networks (CNN) which supports automatic feature extraction. It is capable of learning the global features from imageseffectively for image classification. But it loses the context of local information among the pixels that need to be retained forsegmentation. Also, it must provide more emphasis on the features of the lesion region for precise reconstruction. The majorcontribution of this work is the integration of attention mechanism with a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) to segmentischemic lesion. This attention model is applied to learn and concentrate only on salient features of the lesion region bysuppressing the details of other regions. Hence the proposed FCN with attention mechanism was able to segment ischemiclesion of varying size and shape.

Background: 사용자와 디바이스의 인터랙션에 대한 만족도를 평가할 수 있는 유용한 지표 중 하나는 사용자의 감성 만족도라고 할 수 있다. 하지만 HAII에서의 사용자 감성 평가에 대한 연구는 여전히 부족한 상황이며, 특히 음성 기반 인터랙션에서 사용자가 느끼는 감성을 평가하기 위한 체계나 도구들이 명확하게 제시된 바 없다. 최근, 다양한 모달리티(표정, 뇌파, 음성 등)를 이용한 사용자 감성 평가에 대한 연구가 많이 이루어지고 있지만 음성 기반 인터랙션에서의 사용자 개인에 적용 가능한 적응형 감성 평가 연구는 부족한 실정이다. 본 연구에서는 가장 기본적인 모달리티인 표정 데이터를 이용해서 VUI(Voice User Interface)기반 HAII에서 사용자 감성 평가 연구를 진행하고자 한다.

Results: 실험 결과, HAII 과정에서 수집된 표정 데이터의 VA 점수는 대부분 지루함, 슬픔, 중립을 의미하는 영역대에 집중되었다. 기존의 CK+, Oulu-CASIA 데이터셋의 경우 각 감성 별 과장된 표정에 의하여 CNN feature가 표정에 따라 군집화 되는 모습을 보였으나, HAII 데이터셋의 경우 사용자의 감성 만족도에는 차이가 있더라도 표정에서는 명확히 드러나지 않아, CNN feature 또한 군집화 되지 않는 모습을 보였다. 또한, 서양인 기반 분류 모델은 한국인의 표정을 대부분 중립/슬픔으로 분류하는 것을 확인했으며, 한국인 기반 분류 모델은 특정 감성을 제외하고 서양인의 표정을 제대로 분류하지 못하는 결과를 확인할 수 있었다. Conclusion: 본 연구에서는 다양한 HAII 중 AI 비서, 스피커와 같은 VUI와의 상호작용에서 사용자가 느낄 수 있는 감성을 평가하기 위한 표정 기반 방법론의 적용과 한계점에 대하여 논하였다. 실험 결과를 통하여 음성 기반 HAII에서 사용자 표정을 이용한 감성 만족도 예측의 결과와 시사점들을 도출하였다. 향후 보다 자연스러운 HAII를 위해 음성, 표정, 뇌파 등을 함께 사용하는 멀티모달 인터랙션 기반의 감성 만족도 평가 프레임워크로 확장할 예정이며, 일반 VUI 디바이스의 컴퓨팅 파워를 고려해 경량 딥러닝 기반 감성평가 프로토콜 개발을 진행할 계획이다. Application: 본 연구 내용을 기반으로 자연스러운 음성기반 인터랙션 상황에서 표정 기반 감성 분석을 통한 사용자 맞춤형 서비스 제공이 가능하다. 표정 데이터 뿐만 아니라 음성, 뇌파와 결합해서 더욱 강인한 인터랙션 피드백을 제공할 수 있으며, 사용자 만족도에 큰 이바지를 할 것으로 기대한다.",다국어 초록 정보 없음

Therefore, an accurate prediction of wind power generation is necessary for stable power distribution in the power system. High-precision wind power forecasting provides a reliable basis for dispatching of power system. Since wind power data is time series data with uncertainty, a suitable model, the LSTM algorithm of Keras, was proposed to predict a short-term wind power generation. The LSTM has memory to store past states, so it is suitable for the problem of predicting time series data. This paper proposes a forecasting procedure using an LSTM neural network to forecast wind power. First, Pearson correlation coefficient method is utilized to determine the parameters of LSTM forecasting model. Then a case study was performed using real data collected from a wind farm in Yeongheung to confirm that the LSTM model was suitable for wind power prediction."

The recognition of the surrounding environment is the basis for artificial intelligence that requires interaction with the surroundings, which means that research on object detection is necessary.

In this paper, to improve this point, a transformed transformer structure is applied to improve the performance of segmentation, and it is proposed to use data in a format different from the existing label data. By using a single image as an input, there is no loss of location information, and a lighter model is presented by obtaining a segmentation image without going through a separate process. At the same time, to improve generalization performance, a method of assigning one label to one characteristic rather than assigning one label to one object was applied to the composition of the label data, and the difference in generalization ability was compared."

In the proposed model, agent information of each frame is expressed as a graph and given as a input to a Graph Attention Network to generate interaction-embedded agent information in each frame. Interactions with highly relevant agents can be considered by applying attention in the network to the graphs. This information goes into the input of the Sequence-to-Sequence structured encoder-decoder and predicts the future path of each agent simultaneously.

Image matting is widely used in media art as a way to change background images to different settings, except for the desired objects. We added CBAM to BASNet to increase performance by maintaining its speed through end-to-end training. The proposed artwork consists of three steps. First, the improved BASNet is used to detect the area in the image and calculate the saliency and foreground maps. Second, the saliency map is resized through interpolation, and zero-padding is applied to match the size with the background image. Finally, the saturation calculation of the desired background and saliency map is performed, the saliency area is changed to black using thresholding, and the image and foreground map are saturated again. As a result, we can improve BASNet through our proposed method to better mat the background. The method presented can convey this richer visual beauty by providing a visual illusion through image matting without the use of a chroma key."

The current practice for bridge inspection mainly depends on expert evaluation, which can be subjective. Recent studies have introduced data-driven methods using building information modeling, which can be more efficient and objective, but these methods require manual procedures that consume time and money. To overcome this, this study developed an image-based automatic bridge component classification network to reduce the time and cost required for converting the visual information of bridges to a digital model. The proposed method comprises two convolutional neural networks. The first network estimates the type of the bridge based on the superstructure, and the second network classifies the bridge components. In avalidation test, the proposed system automatically classified the components of 461 bridge images with 96.6 % of accuracy. The proposed approach is expected to contribute toward current bridge maintenance practice."

The purpose of this study was to investigate kinematic differences between overground and treadmill walking, excluding psychological causes, through an AI-based gait controller in a dynamic simulation environment. The gait controller consists of a two-layer neural network, and it was trained by deep reinforcement learning to track a reference motion. The reference motion was made through the experiment of walking on the ground by a subject. This gait controller was tested overground walking and treadmill walking in the simulation. Comparing kinematics in overground walking and treadmill walking, the RMS difference of the knee flexion angle and hip flexion angle were 0.15 degrees and 0.12 degrees, respectively. The peak treadmill speed error during treadmill walking was 14 mm/s, which caused the kinematic difference."

A stereo camera is a sensor that acquires simultaneously RGB images and depth maps, and it is widely used for autonomous vehicles to obtain various information. The developed CNN-based semantic segmentation model with high speed and accuracy was used to recognize the target vehicle, detecting the shape of the target object and omitting background information around it. Due to this effect, the distance between the autonomous vehicle and target vehicle is more accurately estimated. The relative speed between each vehicle was estimated using the distance and time difference between frames. The performance of the proposed algorithm was compared with conventional methods and it was confirmed that the speed of the target vehicle was more accurately estimated using only the stereo camera."

지능형 CCTV 응용을 위한 객체 인식 기반 배경 차분 방법,2021,"['Background subtraction', 'Deep learning', 'Context-awareness']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In this paper, we present a context-aware method for background maintenance. Traditionally, it is often difficult to model a background scene when backgound patterns are dramatically changing over time. In order to handle dynamic background objects, we utilize a standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based 2D object detector to identify the background patterns. The key observation is that detected regions do not belong to a true background. Hence, we consider a new confidence map to update the static background model and exclude pre-learnt background objects for conventional background subtraction methods. To this end, we clearly split the process into training/testing stages, and assume interest objects appear in the testing stage. For a practical application, we obtain two CCTV image sequences for intelligent transport systems, in which the CCTV system aims to automatically detecting the unseen objects in the challenging traffic congestion. Compared to the existing method such as the Mixture of Gaussian (MoG) model, the robustness of the proposed method to dynamic backgrounds is qualitatively shown using the real-world examples."

We use knowledge distillation (KD) to identify the interior of a black-box model for which we know only inputs and outputs. The information of the black box model will be transferred to a white box model that we aim to create through the KD. The white box model will learn the representation of the black-box model. Second, the white-box model generates attention maps for each of its layers using Grad-CAM. Then we combine the attention maps of different layers using the pixel-wise summation to generate a final saliency map that contains information from all layers of the model. The experiments show that the proposed technique found important layers and explained which part of the input is important. Saliency maps generated by the proposed technique performed better than those of Grad-CAM in deletion game."

As a result, many users face information overload problems, which is time-consuming in the purchasing decision-making process. Therefore, the importance of a personalized recommendation service that can provide customized products and services to users is emerging. For example, global companies such as Netflix, Amazon, and Google have introduced personalized recommendation services to support users purchasing decisions. Accordingly, the users information search cost can reduce which can positively affect the companys sales increase. The existing personalized recommendation service research applied Collaborative Filtering (CF) technique predicts user preference mainly use quantified information. However, the recommendation performance may have decreased if only use quantitative information. To improve the problems of such existing studies, many studies using reviews to enhance recommendation performance. However, reviews contain factors that hinder purchasing decisions, such as advertising content, false comments, meaningless or irrelevant content. When providing recommendation service uses a review that includes these factors can lead to decrease recommendation performance. Therefore, we proposed a novel recommendation methodology through CNN-based review usefulness score prediction to improve these problems. The results show that the proposed methodology has better prediction performance than the recommendation method considering all existing preference ratings. In addition, the results suggest that can enhance the performance of traditional CF when the information on review usefulness reflects in the personalized recommendation service."

Solder void defects caused by voids in the solder ball during the BGA process do not directly affect the reliability of the product, but it may accelerate the aging of the device on the PCB layer or interface surface depending on its size or location. Void inspection is important because it is related in yields with products. The most important process in the optical inspection of solder void is the segmentation process of solder and void. However, there are several segmentation algorithms for the vision inspection, it is impossible to inspect all of images ideally. When X-Ray images with poor contrast and high level of noise become difficult to perform image processing for vision inspection in terms of software programming.

Artificial Neural Networks for Analyzing Quantum Many-Body Problems,2021,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"It is a great challenge to accurately represent quantum many-body states. In this talk, we will show that Boltzmann machines used in machine learning can be useful for analyzing quantum many-body systems.  First, we introduce a method for representing quantum states using Boltzmann machines proposed by Carleo and Troyer in 2017. Then, we discuss the progress of the neural-network wave function method for zero-temperature simulations. Through various extensions, the neural-network wave functions are beginning to be applied to challenging problems (e.g., frustrated spin systems) in physics.  Next, we discuss two finite-temperature calculation methods using deep Boltzmann machines (DBMs) with two hidden layers. Both methods use the idea of “purification,” where a finite-temperature mixed state is represented by a pure state of an extended system. The former analytically constructs a pure state corresponding to thermal equilibrium, realizing quantum-to-classical mapping. The latter method obtains the pure state by numerically optimizing the DBM parameters. This method can be applied to, e.g., frustrated systems for which the former method suffers from the negative sign problem. We will discuss the applications to the transverse-field Ising model and J1-J2 Heisenberg model.  These works were done in collaboration with Andrew S. Darmawan, Youhei Yamaji, Masatoshi Imada, Giuseppe Carleo, Nobuyuki Yoshioka, and Franco Nori.〈그림 본문참조〉"

Recently, hyperspectral image classification using deep learning has been developed. Among them, 3D-CNN, which learns spatial information and spectral information together, has excellent performance. However, since 3D-CNN learns spatial information and spectral information together, there is a possibility that the spectral information is diluted. This does not correspond to the hyperspectral image in which the spectral information is significant. This paper suggests that 3D-CNN is not doing the right thing to learn about spectral information in hyperspectral image classification.

This nature of the job has always required intricate systems manufactured using an expensive set of sensors and components. In this paper, we propose a system to draw the trajectory of a golf ball during a drive. The proposed system combines the classical computer vision techniques and a modern deep neural network to project the trajectories over videos taken from monocular cameras. Before starting to track the ball, the system uses YOLO(You Only Look Once) V3, deep neural network model to perform localization of the golf ball and the player. To track the initial point of impact between the club and the ball the system uses Hough transform. Finally to track the ball, the system extracts motion information of the video by using frame differencing. Unto the information received from frame differencing, the system applies filters based on a few assumptions, size and direction of movement to obtain the detections of the golf ball. The proposed system was tested on a multitude of videos to verify its effectiveness and the respective results are presented."

Lightweight multiple scale-patch dehazing network for real-world hazy image,2021,"['Image enhancement', 'Convolutional neural networks', 'Image processing']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Image dehazing is an ill-posed problem which is far from being solved. Traditional image dehazing methods often yield mediocre effects and possess substandard processing speed, while modern deep learning methods perform best only in certain datasets. The haze removal effect when processed by said methods is unsatisfactory, meaning the generalization performance fails to meet the requirements. Concurrently, due to the limited processing speed, most dehazing algorithms cannot be employed in the industry. To alleviate said problems, a light-weight fast dehazing network based on a multiple scale-patch framework (MSP) is proposed in the present paper. Firstly, the multi-scale structure is employed as the backbone network and the multi-patch structure as the supplementary network. Dehazing through a single net-work causes problems, such as loss of object details and color in some image areas, the multi-patch structure was employed for MSP as an information supplement. In the algorithm image processing module, the image is segmented up and down for processed separately. Secondly, MSP generates a clear dehazing effect and significant robustness when targeting real-world homogeneous and nonhomogeneous hazy maps and different datasets. Compared with existing dehazing methods, MSP demonstrated a fast inference speed and the feasibility of real-time processing. The overall size and model parameters of the entire dehazing model are 20.75M and 6.8M, and the processing time for the single image is 0.026s. Experiments on NTIRE 2018 and NTIRE 2020 demonstrate that MSP can achieve superior performance among the state-of-the-art methods, such as PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and individual subjective evaluation."
"“Don’t the Great Tales Never End?”: Tolkien, History, and the Desire Called Marx",2021,"['Tolkien', 'J', 'R', 'R', 'History', 'Marxism', 'Fantasy', 'the Novel']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In a memorable scene from The Lord of the Rings, Samwise Gamgee suddenly realizes the connections between his own story and those legends he had learned in his youth, marveling “Don’t the great tales never end?” Sam’s reference to such grand récits implicates the great metanarrative of History itself, into the midst of which these hobbits find themselves thrust. In this essay, Robert T. Tally Jr. argues that the “realization” of history is an important aim of Tolkien’s art. Tolkien’s yearning for a mythic past, despite its clear nationalism and chauvinism at first, reflected a deep desire to connect his modern world with an august, barely accessible past through forms of historical narrative. This is not an escape into a mythical, premodern realm as is frequently imagined. Rather, it is an attempt to take the broken and disconnected fragments of culture and put them together into a meaningful history, evoking what Tolkien would call “the seamless web of story.” Fredric Jameson, following Lyotard, refers to this as “the desire called Marx.” Tolkien’s experiments with different genres and styles betray the difficulties he had in organizing this overall narrative project, but his impulse in producing a grand narrative involving myth, fairy story, romance, history, and the modern novelistic form is to give shape to a world that had, in his view, lost its sense of history. Through his efforts, Tolkien’s great legendarium provides a historical sensibility for a world that had forgotten how to think historically."

It was also characterized by the use of homonyms to investigate the multiplicity of meanings. In his travel books, the overall composition followed the form of Tosanikki, but the written songs were markedly influenced by Isemonogatari. Besides, one can find his deep passion for classical Waka from his act of borrowing Waka phrases on tea ceremony tools and the use of the place name of Utamakura."

Wintermute in Neuromancer is Tessier-Ashpool SA’s artificial intelligence armed with statistics and mathematics. During Frankenstein monster’s attempt to acquire his female companion and Wintermute’s pursuit to merge with Neuromancer, his sibling artificial intelligence, they exercise murder, fraud, and violence. The monstrosity they show in the challenge derives ultimately from the pains of alienation and isolation, and maladaptation that they suffer. The artificial creatures such as the monster and the artificial intelligence that the creator, an individual or corporation, creates only for their purpose suggest the implicit vision of the future world, but it is not certain whether the future will offer humans hope or danger. The artificial creatures are also members of the posthuman society that will take over the humans’role, competing and struggling with their creators. As the name Frankenstein has ambivalent implications, the creators could be real monsters much more than the creatures are because those who create the monsters with immoderate passion and desire are more dangerous than the creatures. Accordingly, it is important and necessary for humans to control individual or capitalist desire, and also to achieve the co-existent life with balance and harmony in the future posthuman society."

Lightweight image classifier for CIFAR-10,2021,"['Computer vision', 'Convolutional neural networks', 'Image classification', 'Lightweight CNN']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Image classification is one of the fundamental applications of computer vision. It enables a system to identify an object in an image. Recently, image classification applications have broadened their scope from computer applications to edge devices. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is the main class of deep learning neural networks that are widely used in computer tasks, and it delivers high accuracy. However, CNN algorithms use a large number of parameters and incur high computational costs, which hinder their implementation in edge hardware devices. To address this issue, this paper proposes a lightweight image classifier that provides good accuracy while using fewer parameters. The proposed image classifier diverts the input into three paths and utilizes different scales of receptive fields to extract more feature maps while using fewer parameters at the time of training. This results in the development of a model of small size. This model is tested on the CIFAR-10 dataset and achieves an accuracy of 90% using .26M parameters. This is better than the state-of-the-art models, and it can be implemented on edge devices."

The concept of Chinese modern development is pro-people development that aims to meet the basic needs of the common people. Development is for a better and safe life and it appeals to the best of many people. The CPC policy had broader implications for all minority groups, and many of the state policies are a continuation of earlier policies. China’s Muslims are clearly in the threshold in terms of self-preservation and Islamic identity. Uyghur nationalism in Xinjiang was influenced by Muslims of Central Asia, especially Iranian Muslim political ideology. In contemporary China, the growing consciousness of a distinct Uyghur identity should not be linked with political extremist movement –it distorts the political stability and development of the XUAR.

It affects the industry as a whole and daily life in various ways. As data availability increases, artificial intelligence finds an optimal solution and infers/predicts through self-learning. Research and investment related to automation that discovers and solves problems on its own are ongoing continuously. Automation of artificial intelligence has benefits such as cost reduction, minimization of human intervention and the difference of human capability. However, there are side effects, such as limiting the artificial intelligence’s autonomy and erroneous results due to algorithmic bias. In the labor market, it raises the fear of job replacement. Prior studies on the utilization of artificial intelligence have shown that individuals do not necessarily use the information (or advice) it provides. Algorithm error is more sensitive than human error; so, people avoid algorithms after seeing errors, which is called “algorithm aversion.” Recently, artificial intelligence has begun to be understood from the perspective of the augmentation of human intelligence. We have started to be interested in Human-AI collaboration rather than AI alone without human. A study of 1500 companies in various industries found that human-AI collaboration outperformed AI alone. In the medicine area, pathologist-deep learning collaboration dropped the pathologist cancer diagnosis error rate by 85%. Leading AI companies, such as IBM and Microsoft, are starting to adopt the direction of AI as augmented intelligence. Human-AI collaboration is emphasized in the decision-making process, because artificial intelligence is superior in analysis ability based on information. Intuition is a unique human capability so that human-AI collaboration can make optimal decisions. In an environment where change is getting faster and uncertainty increases, the need for artificial intelligence in decision-making will increase. In addition, active discussions are expected on approaches that utilize artificial intelligence for rational decision-making. This study investigates the impact of artificial intelligence on decision-making focuses on human-AI collaboration and the interaction between the decision maker personal traits and advisor type. The advisors were classified into three types: human, artificial intelligence, and human-AI collaboration. We investigated perceived usefulness of advice and the utilization of advice in decision making and whether the decision-maker’s personal traits are influencing factors. Three hundred and eleven adult male and female experimenters conducted a task that predicts the age of faces in photos and the results showed that the advisor type does not directly affect the utilization of advice. The decision-maker utilizes it only when they believed advice can improve prediction performance. In the case of human-AI collaboration, decision-makers higher evaluated the perceived usefulness of advice, regardless of the decision makers personal traits and the advice was more actively utilized. If the type of advisor was artificial intelligence alone, decision-makers who scored high in conscientiousness, high in extroversion, or low in neuroticism, high evaluated the perceived usefulness of the advice so they utilized advice actively. This study has academic significance in that it focuses on human-AI collaboration that the recent growing interest in artificial intelligence roles. It has expanded the relevant research area by considering the role of artificial intelligence as an advisor of decision-making and judgment research, and in aspects of practical significance, suggested views that companies should consider in order to enhance AI capability.

Then, through the DeepFM parameter sharing strategy, the relationship between low- and high-order feature combinations is learned from log data, and the click rate prediction model is constructed. Finally, based on the predicted click-through rate, products are recommended to users in sequence and fed back.

Using a deep learning model based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), multi-criteria prediction ratings were derived from reviews. These ratings were then aggregated to form a linear regression model to predict the overall rating. This model not only predicts the overall rating but also uses the training weights from the layers of the model as the user’s priority. Based on this, a new score matrix for recommendation is derived by calculating the similarity between the user and the item according to the criteria, and an item suitable for the user is proposed. The experiment was conducted by collecting the actual “TripAdvisor” dataset. For performance evaluation, the proposed method was compared with a general recommendation system based on singular value decomposition. The results of the experiments demonstrate the high performance of the proposed method."
Video Expression Recognition Method Based on Spatiotemporal Recurrent Neural Network and Feature Fusion,2021,"['Double Layer Cascade Structure', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Feature Fusion', 'Image Detection', 'Spatiotemporal Recursive Neural Network']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Automatically recognizing facial expressions in video sequences is a challenging task because there is little direct correlation between facial features and subjective emotions in video. To overcome the problem, a video facial expression recognition method using spatiotemporal recurrent neural network and feature fusion is proposed. Firstly, the video is preprocessed. Then, the double-layer cascade structure is used to detect a face in a video image. In addition, two deep convolutional neural networks are used to extract the time-domain and airspace facial features in the video. The spatial convolutional neural network is used to extract the spatial information features from each frame of the static expression images in the video. The temporal convolutional neural network is used to extract the dynamic information features from the optical flow information from multiple frames of expression images in the video. A multiplication fusion is performed with the spatiotemporal features learned by the two deep convolutional neural networks. Finally, the fused features are input to the support vector machine to realize the facial expression classification task. The experimental results on cNTERFACE, RML, and AFEW6.0 datasets show that the recognition rates obtained by the proposed method are as high as 88.67%, 70.32%, and 63.84%, respectively. Comparative experiments show that the proposed method obtains higher recognition accuracy than other recently reported methods."

However, there are many research cases to recognize it as the same vehicle by utilizing the unique advantages of radar and cameras, but they do not use deep learning image processing technology or detect only short distances as the same target due to radar performance problems. Radars can recognize vehicles without errors in situations such as night and fog, but it is not accurate even if the type of object is determined through RCS values, so accurate classification of the object through images such as cameras is required. Therefore, we propose a fusion-based vehicle recognition method that configures data sets that can be collected by radar device and camera device, calculates errors in the data sets, and recognizes them as the same target."

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is ultimately fatal, and accurate diagnosis of IPF is critical to clinical decision making. Visual interpretation of chest high resolution CT (HRCT) is subjective and has limited reproducibility, especially with early disease. So we have previously developed attention-gated deep learning algorithm to diagnosis IPF and machine learning to predict IPF progression. The overall aim of IS-IPF is to collect the data from two centers of excellence and evaluate the robustness of the algorithm. We present the preliminary data of the patients studied following disease classification by the multidisciplinary review committees (MDCs) at UCLA and Asan Medical Center (AMC).MethodsThe IS-IPF study plans to include 234 IPF and 266 non-IPF cases from two large ILD centers (UCLA and AMC). Eligible patients were evaluated in ILD MDC, were >18 years old, had a HRCT, pulmonary function testing, and a committee diagnosis of IPF or non-IPF. Relevant demographic information was collected from the medical record.ResultsTotal 185 IPF and 266 non-IPF patients’ HRCT images have been collected in the IS-IPF study. By center, 51 IPF and 133 non- IPF patients’ HRCT were collected from UCLA, and 134 IPF and 133 non-IPF patients’ HRCT were collected from AMC. On MDC diagnosis, non-IPF cohorts consisted of 33% hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and 67% other connective tissue disease-ILD. Mean age was 61 years (63 IPF and 58 non-IPF), and 63% were male (82% IPF and 57 % non-IPF). Up to date, the predicted FVC was 74.7% and the predicted DLco was 61.6 % in the IPF cohort.

Shape from Focus(SFF) acquires 3D information by using 2D images with different focus levels. In each step of image acquisition, mechanical vibration, referred as jitter noise, occurs. Since the jitter noise changes the focus values of 2D images, it significantly degrades the performance of 3D information estimation. In this paper, a new filtering method which reduces the effects of jitter noise in 3D information estimation is proposed. At first, jitter noise and focus curves are modeled as Lé vy distribution and quadratic function, respectively. Next, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network as one of the deep learning techniques is applied to the modeled focus curves for reducing the jitter noise.

Moreover, with the increasing trend of ESG investment, there exists a tendency to analyze it through AI models. As the existing research about ESG could not explain the relationship between ESG and profit, our research aims to derive the correlation between them via statistical models. We got the dataset from the kaggle website, which involved numerous financial variables and ESG features. Multitudinous models from machine learning and deep learning were utilized for the prediction and the LGBM yielded 0.07 of MAE score, which was the lowest. Moreover, SHAP algorithm and R-squared score were applied in pursuit of better prediction. ESG variable was the third highest feature among variables in the given dataset and R-squared score released 0.99. Both methods proved the high positive relationship between the ESG variable and the net profit margin ratio. Though our research involved a critical limitation that we could not employ various formulas due to the restricted dataset, our research is worthwhile as we successfully derived the positive correlation more accurately compared to previous research."

By using the MTP, inspection can be performed without breaking the object to be inspected. However, there are some problems such as the possibility of overlooking defects. In this paper, to solve the problems we develop a classification method of defect images by deep learning for the automation of MPT. The proposed method is based on the structure of U-Net, which has excellent segmentation capability in image processing, and performs segmentation using an improved model that adds convolutional layers to U-Net.

Kalman filters (KFs) are the most popular in this regard. A various of attitude estimation KFs have been proposed to solve the sensor fusion problem. However, these KFs need to adjust their weights to improve the estimation performance according to dynamic motions of the object. With the dramatic advances in computing capabilities and artificial neural networks (ANN), a number of studies are emerging to solve the attitude estimation problem through ANN. Daniel Weber et al. published a robust IMU-based attitude neural network (RIANN) in 2020 that estimates attitude by training a deep ANN model. RIANN uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) to accurately estimate the attitude even in a long sequence. It also learns about various sampling rates and wide range of motions, so that even if the sampling rate and motion condition are changed, attitude estimation performance does not degrade significantly. In order to analyze the performance of RIANN, this paper compares RIANN with the KFs under various dynamic conditions. To our limited data for comparison, the attitude estimation accuracy of RIANN was superior to those of KFs by 4.6 degree on average."

Through such data, it was discovered that ceramic decorations, as well as the shape and materials of pottery, are a research direction worthy of researchers' study. A decorative technique called dodo technique is a technique that produces patterns using a sharp heel knife. It has taken an important position with its traditional and decorative craft techniques that have continued to develop since ancient times.Chatter mark is one of the decorative techniques that has a long history in pottery culture, and Chatter mark techniques are common in modern pottery works. In addition, the five techniques that occupy an important position in the deep ceramic historical culture are the Chatter mark technique, abbreviation, color summary, and cyanide. It has been attracting attention as a decorative technique discovered accidentally in the process of cutting heels, and in modern times, many artists have learned this technique and applied it to their works through modern works.In investigating the situation in which the modern ceramic industry uses pottery decoration, there are two ceramic production sites, mainly Yongcheon celadon production sites in China and Ondayaki production sites in Japan. The artist, who decorates with the Chatter mark technique, learned from a survey conducted by a relatively large number of producers working at Yongcheon production site and Ondayaki production site.From studying old craft techniques, it leads to research and investigation, preparation and learning, harvesting and production. Through the research of this paper, new decorative effects were obtained from old ceramic crafts. The effects can be classified into three categories, and first, the attention is focused and the hand stability is maintained to create a pattern at once. Second, the choice of tools is important in producing characteristic chatter mark works. Third, a new style of work can be created according to the artist's technique. chatter mark techniques are used in a variety of ways, and we can make use of chatter mark techniques as much as we want. New effects can be achieved when used in conjunction with other techniques. This effect is expressed in a modern way, pioneering a new art world of chatter mark techniques."

In addition to the two pooling methods, however, there are many other pooling types, such as geometric average, harmonic average, among others. Since it is not easy for algorithms to find the best pooling method, usually the pooling types are predefined, which might not be optimal for different tasks. As other parameters in deep learning, however, the type of pooling can be driven by data for a given task. In this paper, we propose α-integration pooling (αI-pooling), which has a trainable parameter α to find the type of pooling. αI-pooling is a general pooling method including max-pooling and arithmetic average-pooling as a special case, depending on the parameter α. Experiments show that αI-pooling outperforms other pooling methods, in image recognition tasks. Also, it turns out that each layer has a different optimal pooling type."

코로나 19 시대 탈북학생들의 교육현황에 관한 연구 - 탈북청소년대안학교를 중심으로 -,2021,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"The prolonged COVID-19 is causing changes in our daily lives and in various areas. The fact that many North Korean defectors living in Korea were born in China and third countries also lived in China for a long time, so their children have little experience in elementary, middle, and high school in South Korea. North Korean defectors are also complaining of difficulties in settling and adapting to Korean society, so their children are only entrusted with public education or alternative school education. Therefore, it can be seen that remote classes and home-centered education brought by the СОVID-19 pandemic are too much for North Korean defectors.This study aims to create basic data to understand their difficulties in learning life by qualitatively analyzing what North Korean refugee children have experienced in public education and alternative education courses in such crisis situations. In addition, we will carefully examine how the educational difficulties experienced by North Korean defectors’ children and their families in the СОVID-19 crisis are different from usual. This is to comprehensively analyze why North Korean defectors’ children face greater difficulties in the COVID-19 crisis and to come up with a solution suitable for them.This study used literature research and qualitative research research methods. As a literature study, previous studies related to education for vulnerable groups in the СОVID-19 crisis and disaster situations were analyzed. Research on North Korean defectors' children looked at studies before СОVID-19, and studies after СОVID-19 flowed into Korea focused on those published from February 2020 until the submission of the final report of this study.As a qualitative study, in-depth interviews were conducted with North Korean defectors. In addition, a focus group interview (FGI) was conducted.The subjects of the study were limited to elementary school students’ families attending public education and adolescents attending North Korean refugee schools among North Korean defectors. The reason is that if public elementary school students take remote classes in the СОVID-19 situation, the subject of tile study is whether their North Korean defectors’ parents are properly coping with this situation. Therefore, in the case of elementary school students who defected from North Korea, the difficulties of North Korean defectors' children were identified through in-depth interviews with their parents. Meanwhile, since North Korean defectors' alternative schools mainly attended by teenagers, North Korean defectors’ alternative schools interviewed North Korean defectors and school officials.Through this study, in the process of passing through the СОVID-19 era, the social function of an alternative school for North Korean defectors was rediscovered. Previously, it had been understood that the function of an alternative school for North Korean defectors mainly helps North Korean defectors learn and settle in South Korean society. However, as the СОVID-19 era passed, it was discovered that alternative schools for North Korean defectors had other social functions.1) An alternative school for North Korean defectors as a learning center for the vulnerable.2) An alternative school for North Korean defectors as a hygiene and health center.3) An alternative school for North Korean defectors as a psychological care center.There are three expected effects from the results of this study. First, it will be an opportunity to take a deep look at the educational field of the next generation of North Korean defectors brought about by СОVID-19. This will be an opportunity to check remote classes in two areas, public education and alternative schools, and various positive-negative effects. Second, it is expected that the government win be able to make specific policy suggestions to government ministries (Unification Ministry, Hana Foundation, Ministry of Education, local governments, etc.) by identifying the grievances of North Korean defectors among the reality of education experienced by the vulnerable in our society. Third, based on the results of this study, It IS expected that better education and welfare policies be prepared for the vulnerable groups (foreign workers, multicultural families, etc.) existing in Korea in the wake of the pandemic era."

However, the conversations with smart speakers are currently initiated by the users unilateral utterance of the call word, and the conversation does not take into account information or tastes of the users situation. This differs from the general communication characteristics between people. In this work, we evaluate the user preference by different levels of active response of the smart speakers that perform proactive conversations by automatically recognizing the users desk activity.Methods: First, we defined a system concept based on deep learning and rule-based models with data acquired from microphones and sound sensors, human sensitivity sensors, and light sensors to automatically recognize the users desk activity. Second, we divided the task situations that can be judged by the system into 19 different levels, and we derived specific scenarios by dividing the active level of the interaction into four stages: non-response, simple response, situation prediction and suggestion, and proactive response executing the suggestions. Third, we evaluated which level of active interaction is more preferred through user evaluation for each task situation. Results: In most task situations, situation prediction and suggestion and proactive response interactions have been shown to be preferable to non-response, while simple response interactions have been evaluated negatively. In particular, the participants in the experiment were found to be concerned about context interruption, especially in situations where they were immersed in certain tasks or where there were several people together.Conclusions: Smart speakers proactive conversation depending on users context will be very useful if the system’s higher recognition accuracy is supported, thereby providing a more extended user experience."

The statement that Shifei Shi Xin is the sprout of intellectual virtue provides room for interpreting it as ‘a reasonable faculty for one’s judgment.’ However, this approach is based on the modern way of understanding the human mind, which is divided into two: reason and emotion. Just as Mencius did, Zhu Xi and Wang Yangming were aware that rational judgment would often distort the situations with obsessive analysis, stratagem, and even deep consideration. Thus, I will examine whether Shifei Shi Xin can be separated into rational judgement and how it can be explained if it must be viewed in terms of one of the bundles of four sprouts. This approach also attempts to confirm whether Shifei Shi Xin can lead to a unity between moral virtues and intellectual virtues. I think we should pay attention to the reason why Mencius cast the concept of four sprouts and view the Shifei Shi Xin from a holistic perspective of the four sprouts. I interpret it as a reaction of the mind that occurs regardless of learning or experiences, before any other calculation was involved. It is an immediate and holistic reaction of mental energy to a particular situation that occurs before being classified into the cognitive or the conative. Keeping the pure reactions of the mind occurring initially is soon enough to be moral motivation. Thus, I will review Zhu and Wang on Shifei Shi Xin and Liangzhi (innate knowledge, 良知) for my entire argument. This review must inevitably be understood in the context of the four sprouts. The reason for taking Zhu and Wang’s discourse is to examine the meaning of the internalization of wisdom (Zhi, 智) in terms of the unity between intellectual virtue and moral virtue. In conclusion, a concern on the unity between them is part of a philosophical project to critically reflect on the dualistic framework that has formed modern philosophy, and it is also necessary to understand Shifei Shi Xin in the totality of the mind."

Research model on stock price prediction system through real-time Macroeconomics index and stock news mining analysis,2021,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"As the global economy stagnated due to the Corona 19 virus from Wuhan, China, most countries, including the US Federal Reserve System, introduced policies to boost the economy by increasing the amount of money. Most of the stock investors tend to invest only by listening to the recommendations of famous YouTubers or acquaintances without analyzing the financial statements of the company, so there is a high possibility of the loss of stock investments. Therefore, in this research, I have used artificial intelligence deep learning techniques developed under the existing automatic trading conditions to analyze and predict macro-indicators that affect stock prices, giving weights on individual stock price predictions through correlations that affect stock prices. In addition, since stock prices react sensitively to real-time stock market news, a more accurate stock price prediction is made by reflecting the weight to the stock price predicted by artificial intelligence through stock market news text mining, providing stock investors with the basis for deciding to make a proper stock investment."

Most of these accidents are caused by small and medium-sized ships and are due to their poor conditions and insufficient equipment compared with larger vessels. Measures are quickly needed to improve the conditions. This paper discusses a video-integrated collision prediction and fall detection system to support the safe navigation of small- and medium-sized ships. The system predicts the collision of ships and detects falls by crew members using the CCTV, displays the analyzed integrated information using automatic identification system (AIS) messages, and provides alerts for the risks identified. The design consists of an object recognition algorithm, interface module, integrated display module, collision prediction and fall detection module, and an alarm management module. For the basic research, we implemented a deep learning algorithm to recognize the ship and crew from images, and an interface module to manage messages from AIS. To verify the implemented algorithm, we conducted tests using 120 images. Object recognition performance is calculated as mAP by comparing the pre-defined object with the object recognized through the algorithms. As results, the object recognition performance of the ship and the crew were approximately 50.44 mAP and 46.76 mAP each. The interface module showed that messages from the installed AIS were accurately converted according to the international standard. Therefore, we implemented an object recognition algorithm and interface module in the designed collision prediction and fall detection system and validated their usability with testing."

The experimental results show that the proposed method is more effective in classifying malware families in terms of processing overhead and classification accuracy."
4차 산업혁명 시대에 필요한 인간상 - 『논어(論語)』와 유자(儒者)의 가르침을 중심으로 -,2021,"['인공지능', 'AI', '·비대면·4차 산업혁명 시대의 인간상·논어·유자·인성· 감성', 'Image of human being during the 4<sup>th</ sup> industrial revolution', 'AI', 'Untact', 'Human value', 'Humanity', 'Sensibility']","본고는 4차 산업혁명 시대에 필요한 인간상을 살펴보고자 한 것이다. 모든 것이 인공지능(AI)의 발달로 대면보다는 비대면으로 전개될 사회에서 인간다운 삶을 영위하기 위해서는 어떤 인간상이 필요하고 왜 그런 인간상인가를 살펴보고자 했던 것이다.인공지능 시대의 필요한 인간상을 『논어』 중 인성 교육에 관한 내용을 살폈고, 전통의 계승 차원에서 선인들의 글과 몇몇 유자들의 인성교육의 내용과 방법 등을 제시하였다. 그리고 계승과 활용 방안에서는 전통의 계승과 변용을 통해, 4차 산업 산업혁명 시기에 인성과 감성을 갖춘 사람이 왜 필요한가를 논하였다.4차 산업혁명 시대는 인공지능의 시대로 이익과 편리함만을 목적으로 삼기 에 인간만이 지닐 수 있는 가치들이 더 빛을 발할 수 있는 시기일 수 있다. 그래서 인성교육법에 포함된 예와 효, 정직과 소통, 그리고 공감의 차원에서 미래의 인간상을 예견해 본 것이다. 살펴본 결과 공교롭게도 인공지능에 주력하면 할수록 감성적 측면인 휴먼터치(Human Touch)를 그리워한다는 것이다. 이미 진행 중인 감성 경영이 이를 뒷받침하였다. 따라서 미래 사회에서도 전통적으로 계승 발전 시켜온 인간 고유의 영역이라고 할 인성과 감성 교육을 강화하여 인류 행복과 문화 발전에 이바지할 수 있게 해야 할 것이다.","The era of the 4th industrial revolution is the era that can change the world with devices humans have not ever experienced, as machine learning, deep learning, and AI (artificial intelligence) will transform the world. Thus, AI will predict the future as it evolves, and will continue to learn by itself. Existing lifestyles will be externally changed in the future, and the untact lifestyle will be more common than face-to-face life and it will make person-to-person interactions further disconnected.What is the image of the human that is necessary during the era of the 4th industrial revolution? It needs an image of a human being that can manipulate information appliances or mobile devices skillfully and acquires and adapts to new skills without resistance. However, we can speculate what will be necessary in the future when considering the weaknesses in the early stages of AI. In the era of materialism, human virtues are worthlessly discarded, which leads to the degradation of human values. Therefore, we need an image of a human being that creates a humanity where human nature is recovered. As there are no children without parents, we should not have communication problems and always be honest, extending every courtesy by recovering good nature through filial duty (孝) remaining a permanent truth.Additionally, emotional human-touch will be paradoxically missed by people during the era of AI that is equipped with convenience and rapidity. The most one that we say to AI ‘Genie’ as a product of untact era is ‘Genie, I love you’, and we can guess what people may want from this. Work efficiency is improved by celebrating various anniversaries through emotional management in the workplace that is perceived as a base. As AI improves, humans will continue to thirst for sympathy and physical contact. Thus, a new image of a human being is necessary in the era of 4th industrial resolution, and particularly one that is warm-hearted and one with humanity."
딥러닝을 활용한 설비 이상 탐지 및 성능 분석,2021,"['Manufacturing Data', 'Anomaly Detection', 'Autoencoder', 'AAE', 'VAE']","스마트공장 구축사업을 통해 제조업의 생산설비에 센서가 설치되고 각종 공정데이터를 실시간으로 수집할 수 있게 되었다. 이를 통해 제조공정의 설비 이상으로 인한 생산중단을 줄이기 위해 실시간 설비 이상 탐지에 대한 연구가 활발히 진행되고 있다. 본 논문에서는 생산설비의 이상탐지를 위해 제조데이터를 딥러닝 모델인 Autoencoder(AE), VAE(Variational Autoencoder), AAE(Adversarial Autoencoder)에 적용하여 그 결과를 도출하였다. 제조데이터는 단순 이동 평균 기법과 전처리 과정을 거쳐 입력데이터로 사용하였으며, 단순이동평균 기법의 윈도우 크기와 AE 모델의 특징벡터 크기에 따른 성능분석을 실시하였다.","Through the smart factory construction project, sensors can be installed in manufacturing production facilities and various process data can be collected in real time.

Framework for Reconstructing 2D Data Imported from Mobile Devices into 3D Models,2021,"['3D Reconstruction', 'Backend', 'Frontend', 'AI', 'Mobile']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The 3D industry is drawing attention for its applications in various markets, including architecture, media, VR/AR, metaverse, imperial broadcast, and etc.. The current feature of the architecture we are introducing is to make 3D models more easily created and modified than conventional ones. Existing methods for generating 3D models mainly obtain values using specialized equipment such as RGB-D cameras and Lidar cameras, through which 3D models are constructed and used. This requires the purchase of equipment and allows the generated 3D model to be verified by the computer. However, our framework allows users to collect data in an easier and cheaper manner using cell phone cameras instead of specialized equipment, and uses 2D data to proceed with 3D modeling on the server and output it to cell phone application screens. This gives users a more accessible environment. In addition, in the 3D modeling process, object classification is attempted through deep learning without user intervention, and mesh and texture suitable for the object can be applied to obtain a lively 3D model. It also allows users to modify mesh and texture through requests, allowing them to obtain sophisticated 3D models."
코로나-19 상황에서 의예과 학생들의 심리적 특성과 자기 돌아보기 명상의 교육적 효과,2021,"['medical leadership', 'self reflection', 'self-esteem', 'self-reflection meditation', '의사와 리더십', '자기성찰', '자아존중감', '자기돌아보기 명상']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Background : In the situation of the national crisis caused by Covid-19, healthcare providers face leadership challenges and professional composure for the benefit of the community. This article aims to find out that self-reflection meditation class for premedical students improves medical leadership and resilience needed for healthcare providers.Methods : The sample was comprised of 109 premedical students at Pusan National University. We lectured ‘Physicians and leadership’ class focused on self-reflection and meditation for six weeks. We surveyed stress factors, self-reflection, self-esteem, and expectations for life before the class and asked about course satisfaction and changes after the class. A total of 109 questionnaires were retrieved to analyze the data and derive the results of the study.Results : In the questionnaires about stress factors and self-reflections, grades and exams and questions related to expectations for life recorded the highest average, and negative thinking about self-esteem has the lowest score. In the questionnaire, which asked students to describe their feelings and changes through meditation, most students answered that they could learn to empty negative feelings and be emotionally calm and stable. These were also found in the reflection note analysis. Students experienced ‘self-understanding through deep reflection’ and ‘resolve vague anxiety and fear’ through meditation. This also leads to increase self-awareness and self-satisfaction.Conclusion : Self-reflection meditation class improved emotional and psychological stability for students and fostered self-leadership to drive their lives in the direction they want. This facilitates interpersonal relationships, leadership, and resilience needed as a healthcare provider."
