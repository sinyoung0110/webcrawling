Development of a Hybrid Deep-Learning Model for the Human Activity Recognition based on the Wristband Accelerometer Signals,2021,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Human Activity Recognition', 'Smartwatch', 'Accelerometer', 'Machine Learning', 'Activity Classification', 'Feature Extraction', 'Feature Reduction']",,"This study aims to develop a human activity recognition (HAR) system as a Deep-Learning (DL) classification model, distinguishing various human activities. We solely rely on the signals from a wristband accelerometer worn by a person for the user's convenience. 3-axis sequential acceleration signal data are gathered within a predefined time-window-slice, and they are used as input to the classification system. We are particularly interested in developing a Deep-Learning model that can outperform conventional machine learning classification performance. A total of 13 activities based on the laboratory experiments' data are used for the initial performance comparison. We have improved classification performance using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with an auto-encoder feature reduction and parameter tuning. With various publically available HAR datasets, we could also achieve significant improvement in HAR classification. Our CNN model is also compared against Recurrent-Neural-Network(RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) to demonstrate its superiority. Noticeably, our model could distinguish both general activities and near-identical activities such as sitting down on the chair and floor, with almost perfect classification accuracy."

The objective of this study is to verify the reliability of the proposed method by applying deep learning to improve the applicability of the method. The AHP-based deterministic method comprises eight factors: fines content, soil thickness, porosity, elastic modulus, shear strength, hydraulic conductivity, saturation, and water content. After dividing the testing area into 1 m square grids, eight factors were derived through field and laboratory experiments. The factor of safety was calculated based on the Mohr-Coulomb failure theory. Finally, the input and output values of deep learning were obtained. Bayesian regularization was applied among gradient descents to improve the learning efficiency when applying machine learning. The actual and predicted factors of safety were compared, and they showed excellent reliability in both the training and test phases. This study demonstrates that the AHP-based deterministic method with deep learning is valuable for determining landslide risk areas."
Secure Ob ject Detection Based on Deep Learning,2021,"['Deep Learning', 'Integrity', 'Object Detection', 'Privacy', 'Robustness']",,"Applications for object detection are expanding as it is automated through artificial intelligence-based processing, such as deep learning, on a large volume of images and videos. High dependence on training data and a non-transparent way to find answers are the common characteristics of deep learning. Attacks on training data and training models have emerged, which are closely related to the nature of deep learning. Privacy, integrity, and robustness for the extracted information are important security issues because deep learning enables object recognition in images and videos.

Deep Learning Machine Vision System with High Object Recognition Rate using Multiple-Exposure Image Sensing Method,2021,"['Deep learning', 'object recognition', 'machine vision system', 'multiple exposure', 'wide dynamic range']",,"In this study, we propose a machine vision system with a high object recognition rate. By utilizing a multiple-exposure image sensing technique, the proposed deep learning-based machine vision system can cover a wide light intensity range without further learning processes on the various light intensity range. If the proposed machine vision system fails to recognize object features, the system operates in a multiple-exposure sensing mode and detects the target object that is blocked in the near dark or bright region. Furthermore, shortand long-exposure images from the multiple-exposure sensing mode are synthesized to obtain accurate object feature information. That results in the generation of a wide dynamic range of image information. Even with the object recognition resources for the deep learning process with a light intensity range of only 23 dB, the prototype machine vision system with the multiple-exposure imaging method demonstrated an object recognition performance with a light intensity range of up to 96 dB."
"Clinical, histological, and deep learning-based assessments and treatment of oral verruciform xanthoma: a case report",2021,"['Biopsy', 'Deep learning', 'Hard palate', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Xanthomatosis']",,"Verruciform xanthoma is a benign growth found on the oral mucosa. Clinically, verruciform xanthoma is an asymptomatic lesion, and depending on the amount of keratin present on the surface of the oral mucosa, it can appear as a reddish-gray papillary, flat lesion or a slightly raised, rough lesion. The verrucous structure and exophytic properties of these lesions are similar to those of malignant tumors; therefore, histopathological assessment is required for an accurate and definitive diagnosis. The purpose of this case report is to present the clinical, histological, and deep learning-based assessments and treatment of verruciform xanthoma of the maxillary palatal gingiva."
Deep Learning-Based Modulation Detection for NOMA Systems,2021,"['Modulation Detection', 'NOMA', 'Wavelet Denoising', 'Residual Network']",,"Since the signal with strong power need be demodulated first for successive interference cancellation (SIC) receiver in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems, the base station (BS) need inform the near user terminal (UT), which has allocated higher power, of the far UT’s modulation mode. To avoid unnecessary signaling overhead of control channel, a blind detection algorithm of NOMA signal modulation mode is designed in this paper. Taking the joint constellation density diagrams of NOMA signal as the detection features, the deep residual network is built for classification, so as to detect the modulation mode of NOMA signal. In view of the fact that the joint constellation diagrams are easily polluted by high intensity noise and lose their real distribution pattern, the wavelet denoising method is adopted to improve the quality of constellations. The simulation results represent that the proposed algorithm can achieve satisfactory detection accuracy in NOMA systems. In addition, the factors affecting the recognition performance are also verified and analyzed."
A deep learning-based approach for feeding behavior recognition of weanling pigs,2021,"['Convolutional neural network', 'Deep learning', 'Behavior detection', 'Processing', 'Weanling pig']",,"Feeding is the most important behavior that represents the health and welfare of weanling pigs. The early detection of feed refusal is crucial for the control of disease in the initial stages and the detection of empty feeders for adding feed in a timely manner. This paper proposes a real-time technique for the detection and recognition of small pigs using a deep-leaning-based method. The proposed model focuses on detecting pigs on a feeder in a feeding position. Conventional methods detect pigs and then classify them into different behavior gestures. In contrast, in the proposed method, these two tasks are combined into a single process to detect only feeding behavior to increase the speed of detection. Considering the significant differences between pig behaviors at different sizes, adaptive adjustments are introduced into a you-only-look-once (YOLO) model, including an angle optimization strategy between the head and body for detecting a head in a feeder. According to experimental results, this method can detect the feeding behavior of pigs and screen non-feeding positions with 95.66%, 94.22%, and 96.56% average precision (AP) at an intersection over union (IoU) threshold of 0.5 for YOLOv3, YOLOv4, and an additional layer and with the proposed activation function, respectively. Drinking behavior was detected with 86.86%, 89.16%, and 86.41% AP at a 0.5 IoU threshold for YOLOv3, YOLOv4, and the proposed activation function, respectively. In terms of detection and classification, the results of our study demonstrate that the proposed method yields higher precision and recall compared to conventional methods."
Creating Deep Learning-based Acrobatic Videos Using Imitation Videos,2021,"['Augmented Reality', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Pose Tracking', 'Motion Analysis', 'Physics Optimization']",,"This paper proposes an augmented reality technique to generate acrobatic scenes from hitting motion videos. After a user shoots a motion that mimics hitting an object with hands or feet, their pose is analyzed using motion tracking with deep learning to track hand or foot movement while hitting the object. Hitting position and time are then extracted to generate the object’s moving trajectory using physics optimization and synchronized with the video. The proposed method can create videos for hitting objects with feet, e.g. soccer ball lifting; fists, e.g. tap ball, etc. and is suitable for augmented reality applications to include virtual objects."
POI Recommendation Method Based on Multi-Source Information Fusion Using Deep Learning in Location-Based Social Networks,2021,"['Convolutional Neural Network', 'Emotional Information', 'Geographical Information', 'Latent Factor Modelling', 'Location-Based Social Network', 'Objective Function']",,"Sign-in point of interest (POI) are extremely sparse in location-based social networks, hindering recommendation systems from capturing users’ deep-level preferences. To solve this problem, we propose a content-aware POI recommendation algorithm based on a convolutional neural network. First, using convolutional neural networks to process comment text information, we model location POI and user latent factors. Subsequently, the objective function is constructed by fusing users’ geographical information and obtaining the emotional category information. In addition, the objective function comprises matrix decomposition and maximisation of the probability objective function. Finally, we solve the objective function efficiently. The prediction rate and F1 value on the Instagram-NewYork dataset are 78.32% and 76.37%, respectively, and those on the Instagram-Chicago dataset are 85.16% and 83.29%, respectively. Comparative experiments show that the proposed method can obtain a higher precision rate than several other newer recommended methods."
Is it possible to forecast KOSPI direction using deep learning methods?,2021,"['deep learning', 'machine learning', 'time-series data', '1D-CNN', 'LSTM']",,"Deep learning methods have been developed, used in various fields, and they have shown outstanding performances in many cases. Many studies predicted a daily stock return, a classic example of time-series data, using deep learning methods. We also tried to apply deep learning methods to Korea's stock market data. We used Korea's stock market index (KOSPI) and several individual stocks to forecast daily returns and directions. We compared several deep learning models with other machine learning methods, including random forest and XGBoost. In regression, long short term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) models are better than other prediction models. For the classification applications, there is no clear winner. However, even the best deep learning models cannot predict significantly better than the simple base model. We believe that it is challenging to predict daily stock return data even if we use the latest deep learning methods."
Model Inversion Attack: Analysis under Gray-box Scenario on Deep Learning based Face Recognition System,2021,"['Model Inversion Attack', 'Deep Learning', 'Face Recognition System', 'Media Clone']",,"In a wide range of ML applications, the training data contains privacy-sensitive information that should be kept secure. Training the ML systems by privacy-sensitive data makes the ML model inherent to the data. As the structure of the model has been fine-tuned by training data, the model can be abused for accessing the data by the estimation in a reverse process called model inversion attack (MIA). Although, MIA has been applied to shallow neural network models of recognizers in literature and its threat in privacy violation has been approved, in the case of a deep learning (DL) model, its efficiency was under question. It was due to the complexity of a DL model structure, big number of DL model parameters, the huge size of training data, big number of registered users to a DL model and thereof big number of class labels. This research work first analyses the possibility of MIA on a deep learning model of a recognition system, namely a face recognizer. Second, despite the conventional MIA under the white box scenario of having partial access to the users' non-sensitive information in addition to the model structure, the MIA is implemented on a deep face recognition system by just having the model structure and parameters but not any user information. In this aspect, it is under a semi-white box scenario or in other words a gray-box scenario. The experimental results in targeting five registered users of a CNN-based face recognition system approve the possibility of regeneration of users' face images even for a deep model by MIA under a gray box scenario. Although, for some images the evaluation recognition score is low and the generated images are not easily recognizable, but for some other images the score is high and facial features of the targeted identities are observable. The objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that privacy cyber-attack by MIA on a deep recognition system not only is feasible but also is a serious threat with increasing alert state in the future as there is considerable potential for integration more advanced ML techniques to MIA."
Multi Label Deep Learning classification approach for False Data Injection Attacks in Smart Grid,2021,"['Deep learning', 'False Data Injection Attack', 'Internet of Things', 'Machine learning', 'Multi-label Classification', 'Power System', 'Smart grid']",,"The smart grid replaces the traditional power structure with information inventiveness that contributes to a new physical structure. In such a field, malicious information injection can potentially lead to extreme results. Incorrect, FDI attacks will never be identified by typical residual techniques for false data identification. Most of the work on the detection of FDI attacks is based on the linearized power system model DC and does not detect attacks from the AC model. Also, the overwhelming majority of current FDIA recognition approaches focus on FDIA, whilst significant injection location data cannot be achieved. Building on the continuous developments in deep learning, we propose a Deep Learning based Locational Detection technique to continuously recognize the specific areas of FDIA. In the development area solver gap happiness is a False Data Detector (FDD) that incorporates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The FDD is established enough to catch the fake information. As a multi-label classifier, the following CNN is utilized to evaluate the irregularity and cooccurrence dependency of power flow calculations due to the possible attacks. There are no earlier statistical assumptions in the architecture proposed, as they are ""model-free."" It is also ""cost-accommodating"" since it does not alter the current FDD framework and it is only several microseconds on a household computer during the identification procedure. We have shown that ANN-MLP, SVM-RBF, and CNN can conduct locational detection under different noise and attack circumstances through broad experience in IEEE 14, 30, 57, and 118 bus systems. Moreover, the multi-name classification method used successfully improves the precision of the present identification."
Deep Learning Assisted Differential Cryptanalysis for the Lightweight Cipher SIMON,2021,"['Deep Learning', 'Cryptography', 'Lightweight Cipher', 'Differential Cryptanalysis', 'SIMON']",,"SIMON and SPECK are two families of lightweight block ciphers that have excellent performance on hardware and software platforms. At CRYPTO 2019, Gohr first introduces the differential cryptanalysis based deep learning on round-reduced SPECK32/64, and finally reduces the remaining security of 11-round SPECK32/64 to roughly 38 bits. In this paper, we are committed to evaluating the safety of SIMON cipher under the neural differential cryptanalysis. We firstly prove theoretically that SIMON is a non-Markov cipher, which means that the results based on conventional differential cryptanalysis may be inaccurate. Then we train a residual neural network to get the 7-, 8-, 9-round neural distinguishers for SIMON32/64. To prove the effectiveness for our distinguishers, we perform the distinguishing attack and key-recovery attack against 15-round SIMON32/64. The results show that the real ciphertexts can be distinguished from random ciphertexts with a probability close to 1 only by 28.7 chosen-plaintext pairs. For the key-recovery attack, the correct key was recovered with a success rate of 23%, and the data complexity and computation complexity are as low as 28 and 220.1 respectively. All the results are better than the existing literature. Furthermore, we briefly discussed the effect of different residual network structures on the training results of neural distinguishers. It is hoped that our findings will provide some reference for future research."
Implementation of an Autostereoscopic Virtual 3D Button in Non-contact Manner Using Simple Deep Learning Network,2021,"['AI', 'Deep Learning', 'Non-contact', 'Stereoscopic', 'Virtual Button', '3D']",,"This research presented an implementation of autostereoscopic virtual three-dimensional (3D) button device as non-contact style.

The device was designed to be contactless to prevent virus contamination and consists of 3D buttons in a virtual stereoscopic view. To specify the button pressed virtually by fingertip pointing, a simple deep learning network having two stages without convolution filters was designed. As confirmed in the experiment, if the input data composition is clearly designed, the deep learning network does not need to be configured so complexly. As the results of testing and evaluation by the certification institute, the proposed button device shows high reliability and stability."
Application of deep learning to predict advanced neoplasia using big clinical data in colorectal cancer screening of asymptomatic adults,2021,"['Colorectal neoplasms', 'Deep learning', 'Big data', 'Risk assessment', 'Mass screening']",,"Background/Aims: We aimed to develop a deep learning model for the prediction of the risk of advanced colorectal neoplasia (ACRN) in asymptomatic adults, based on which colorectal cancer screening could be customized.Methods: We collected data on 26 clinical and laboratory parameters, including age, sex, smoking status, body mass index, complete blood count, blood chemistry, and tumor marker, from 70,336 first-time colonoscopy screening recipients. For reference, we used a logistic regression (LR) model with nine variables manually selected from the 26 variables. A deep neural network (DNN) model was developed using all 26 variables. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of the models were compared in a randomly split validation group.Results: In comparison with the LR model (AUC, 0.724; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.684 to 0.765), the DNN model (AUC, 0.760; 95% CI, 0.724 to 0.795) demonstrated significantly improved performance with respect to the prediction of ACRN (p < 0.001). At a sensitivity of 90%, the specificity significantly increased with the application of the DNN model (41.0%) in comparison with the LR model (26.5%) (p < 0.001), indicating that the colonoscopy workload required to detect the same number of ACRNs could be reduced by 20%.Conclusions: The application of DNN to big clinical data could significantly improve the prediction of ACRNs in comparison with the LR model, potentially realizing further customization by utilizing large quantities and various types of biomedical information."
Empirical Performance Evaluation of Communication Libraries for Multi-GPU based Distributed Deep Learning in a Container Environment,2021,"['Docker', 'Collective Communication', 'Distributed Deep Leaning', 'Multi-GPU']",,"Recently, most cloud services use Docker container environment to provide their services. However, there are no researches to evaluate the performance of communication libraries for multi-GPU based distributed deep learning in a Docker container environment. In this paper, we propose an efficient communication architecture for multi-GPU based deep learning in a Docker container environment by evaluating the performances of various communication libraries. We compare the performances of the parameter server architecture and the All-reduce architecture, which are typical distributed deep learning architectures. Further, we analyze the performances of two separate multi-GPU resource allocation policies ― allocating a single GPU to each Docker container and allocating multiple GPUs to each Docker container. We also experiment with the scalability of collective communication by increasing the number of GPUs from one to four. Through experiments, we compare OpenMPI and MPICH, which are representative open source MPI libraries, and NCCL, which is NVIDIA’s collective communication library for the multi-GPU setting. In the parameter server architecture, we show that using CUDA-aware OpenMPI with multi-GPU per Docker container environment reduces communication latency by up to 75%. Also, we show that using NCCL in All-reduce architecture reduces communication latency by up to 93% compared to other libraries."
Two-stage Deep Learning Model with LSTM-based Autoencoder and CNN for Crop Classification Using Multi-temporal Remote Sensing Images,2021,"['Autoencoder', 'Convolutional neural network', 'Crop classification', 'Long short-term memory', 'Multi-temporal images']",,"This study proposes a two-stage hybrid classification model for crop classification using multi-temporal remote sensing images; the model combines feature embedding by using an autoencoder (AE) with a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier to fully utilize features including informative temporal and spatial signatures. Long short-term memory (LSTM)-based AE (LAE) is fine-tuned using class label information to extract latent features that contain less noise and useful temporal signatures. The CNN classifier is then applied to effectively account for the spatial characteristics of the extracted latent features. A crop classification experiment with multi-temporal unmanned aerial vehicle images is conducted to illustrate the potential application of the proposed hybrid model. The classification performance of the proposed model is compared with various combinations of conventional deep learning models (CNN, LSTM, and convolutional LSTM) and different inputs (original multi-temporal images and features from stacked AE). From the crop classification experiment, the best classification accuracy was achieved by the proposed model that utilized the latent features by fine-tuned LAE as input for the CNN classifier. The latent features that contain useful temporal signatures and are less noisy could increase the class separability between crops with similar spectral signatures, thereby leading to superior classification accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate the importance of effective feature extraction and the potential of the proposed classification model for crop classification using multi-temporal remote sensing images."
Keypoint-based Deep Learning Approach for Building Footprint Extraction Using Aerial Images,2021,"['Building footprint extraction', 'Keypoint detection', 'Instance segmentation', 'Deep learning']",,"Building footprint extraction is an active topic in the domain of remote sensing, since buildings are a fundamental unit of urban areas. Deep convolutional neural networks successfully perform footprint extraction from optical satellite images. However, semantic segmentation produces coarse results in the output, such as blurred and rounded boundaries, which are caused by the use of convolutional layers with large receptive fields and pooling layers. The objective of this study is to generate visually enhanced building objects by directly extracting the vertices of individual buildings by combining instance segmentation and keypoint detection. The target keypoints in building extraction are defined as points of interest based on the local image gradient direction, that is, the vertices of a building polygon. The proposed framework follows a two-stage, top-down approach that is divided into object detection and keypoint estimation. Keypoints between instances are distinguished by merging the rough segmentation masks and the local features of regions of interest. A building polygon is created by grouping the predicted keypoints through a simple geometric method. Our model achieved an F1-score of 0.650 with an mIoU of 62.6 for building footprint extraction using the OpenCitesAI dataset. The results demonstrated that the proposed framework using keypoint estimation exhibited better segmentation performance when compared with Mask R-CNN in terms of both qualitative and quantitative results."

Accordingly, the elderly at high risk of being in an accident need autonomous-driving vehicles. In order to secure driving safety on the road, several technologies to respond to various obstacles are required in those vehicles. Among them, technology is required to recognize static obstacles, such as poor road conditions, as well as dynamic obstacles, such as vehicles, bicycles, and people, that may be encountered while driving. In this study, we propose a deep neural network algorithm capable of simultaneously detecting these two types of obstacle. For this algorithm, we used 1,418 road images and produced annotation data that marks seven categories of dynamic obstacles and labels images to indicate road damage. As a result of training, dynamic obstacles were detected with an average accuracy of 46.22%, and road surface damage was detected with a mean intersection over union of 74.71%. In addition, the average elapsed time required to process a single image is 89ms, and this algorithm is suitable for personal mobility vehicles that are slower than ordinary vehicles. In the future, it is expected that driving safety with personal mobility vehicles will be improved by utilizing technology that detects road obstacles."

Resource Allocation for Heterogeneous Service in Green Mobile Edge Networks Using Deep Reinforcement Learning,2021,"['Deep reinforcement learning', 'green energy', 'heterogeneous service', 'mobile edge computing', 'power consumption', 'resource allocation']",,"The requirements for powerful computing capability, high capacity, low latency and low energy consumption of emerging services, pose severe challenges to the fifth-generation (5G) network. As a promising paradigm, mobile edge networks can provide services in proximity to users by deploying computing components and cache at the edge, which can effectively decrease service delay. However, the coexistence of heterogeneous services and the sharing of limited resources lead to the competition between various services for multiple resources. This paper considers two typical heterogeneous services: computing services and content delivery services, in order to properly configure resources, it is crucial to develop an effective offloading and caching strategies. Considering the high energy consumption of 5G base stations, this paper considers the hybrid energy supply model of traditional power grid and green energy. Therefore, it is necessary to design a reasonable association mechanism which can allocate more service load to base stations rich in green energy to improve the utilization of green energy. This paper formed the joint optimization problem of computing offloading, caching and resource allocation for heterogeneous services with the objective of minimizing the on-grid power consumption under the constraints of limited resources and QoS guarantee. Since the joint optimization problem is a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem that is impossible to solve, this paper uses deep reinforcement learning method to learn the optimal strategy through a lot of training. Extensive simulation experiments show that compared with other schemes, the proposed scheme can allocate resources to heterogeneous service according to the green energy distribution which can effectively reduce the traditional energy consumption."
A hidden anti-jamming method based on deep reinforcement learning,2021,"['Environmental Cognition', 'Anti-Intelligent Jamming', 'Deep Reinforcement Learning', 'Hidden Anti-Jamming']",,"In the field of anti-jamming based on dynamic spectrum, most methods try to improve the ability to avoid jamming and seldom consider whether the jammer would perceive the user's signal. Although these existing methods work in some anti-jamming scenarios, their long-term performance may be depressed when intelligent jammers can learn user's waveform or decision information from user's historical activities. Hence, we proposed a hidden anti-jamming method to address this problem by reducing the jammer's sense probability. In the proposed method, the action correlation between the user and the jammer is used to evaluate the hiding effect of the user's actions. And a deep reinforcement learning framework, including specific action correlation calculation and iteration learning algorithm, is designed to maximize the hiding and communication performance of the user synchronously. The simulation result shows that the algorithm proposed reduces the jammer's sense probability significantly and improves the user's anti-jamming performance slightly compared to the existing algorithms based on jamming avoidance."

The proportion of output in the network output of the entire multiscale network. Then, the compressed dictionary learning and the data dimension reduction are carried out using the effective block structure method combined with very sparse random projection matrix, which solves the computational complexity caused by high-dimensional features and shortens the dictionary learning time.

Evaluation of Ultra-low-dose (ULD) Lung Computed Tomography (CT) Using Deep-learning: A Phantom Study,2021,"['electromagnetic wave', 'Computed tomography (CT)', 'low-dose', 'deep learning', 'image quality']",,"As an electromagnetic wave, X-rays are used to acquire diagnostic CT images. The aim of this phantom study was to evaluate the image quality of ultra-low-dose (ULD) lung computed tomography (CT) achieved using a deep-learning based image reconstruction method. The chest phantom was scanned with a tube voltage of 100 kV for various CT dose index (CTDIvol) conditions: 0.4 mGy for ultra-low-dose (ULD), 0.6 mGy for low-dose (LD), 2.7 mGy for standard (SD), and 7.1 mGy for large size (LS). The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and noise values in reconstructions produced via filtered back projection (FBP), iterative reconstruction (IR), and deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) were computed for comparison. The quantitative results of both the SNR and noise indicate that the adoption of the DCNN makes the image reconstruction in the ULD setting more stable and robust, achieving a higher image quality when compared with the FBP algorithm in the SD condition. Compared with the conventional FBP and IR, the proposed deep learning-based image reconstruction approach can improve the ULD CT image quality while significantly reducing the patient dose."
DC series arc diagnosis based on deep‑learning algorithm with frequency‑domain characteristics,2021,"['DC series arc', 'Frequency domain', 'Fast Fourier transform (FFT)', 'Deep neural network (DNN)']",,"A series arc produces both light and heat, which results in a risk of fire. Hence, its prompt detection is very important. The series arc has different frequency characteristics depending on the operating conditions of the inverter and the line impedance. As a result, it is difficult to detect with conventional methods that use specific frequency bands. In this study, series arcs generated by three-phase pulse-width-modulated and three-phase model-predictive-control inverter loads, operating under various conditions, were detected using a deep-learning algorithm. To detect a series arc fault, the frequency characteristics were analyzed using all the frequency bands of a fast Fourier transform (FFT) result. To use all the frequency bands, a deep neural network (DNN), which is a deep-learning algorithm, was used. DNNs can learn quickly from large amounts of data and model complex nonlinear relationships. The DNN model proposed in this paper was designed to use all the frequency bands, and three cases were tested by changing the current magnitude and switching frequency. The arc current detection accuracy was calculated for three test cases and the obtained results were analyzed in detail based on the percentages of true/false and mean absolute error metrics. The analysis confirmed that the arc current was accurately detected, which validates the suitability of the DNN for series arc detection."
"A Sentiment Analysis of Men""s and Women""s Speech: Dictionary-based vs. Deep-learning-based Analysis",2021,"['BNC64', 'sentiment analysis', 'dictionary-based', 'GRU', 'BERT']",,"It is well known that the language women use is different from men""s use. In this paper, the researchers examine men""s and women""s speech through sentiment analysis. For the study of gender differences, this study uses the BNC64 corpus, whose files are selected from the British National Corpus (BNC). The BNC64 corpus is composed of 64 files, which are taken from the spoken part of the BNC. The corpus contains 32 files for male speakers and 32 files for female speakers that represent the characteristics of male vs. female differences. The study analyzed all 64 files using sentiment analysis and tried to discover the differences. It is known that there are roughly three types of approach to sentiment analysis: dictionary-based analysis, machine-learning-based analysis, and deep-learning-based analysis. This study takes the first and third kind of analyses. In the dictionary-based analysis, the researchers calculate the sentiment score (SS), sentiment word ratio (SR), and positive word ratio (PR). In the deep-learning analysis, the researchers take two different sorts of analyses: the GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) and the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). Through the analyses, the study finds that (i) there is no significant differences in SS and SR between men and women, (ii) women usually use more positive words than men, and the differences are statistically significant, and (iii) the deep-learning-based analysis is much superior to modelling the gender differences in the sentiment analysis."

Validation of Deep-Learning Image Reconstruction for Low-Dose Chest Computed Tomography Scan: Emphasis on Image Quality and Noise,2021,"['Multidetector computed tomography', 'Lung', 'Image processing', 'computer-assisted', 'Deep learning', 'Image enhancement']",,"Objective: Iterative reconstruction degrades image quality. Thus, further advances in image reconstruction are necessary to overcome some limitations of this technique in low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scan of the chest. Deep-learning image reconstruction (DLIR) is a new method used to reduce dose while maintaining image quality. The purposes of this study was to evaluate image quality and noise of LDCT scan images reconstructed with DLIR and compare with those of images reconstructed with the adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction-Veo at a level of 30% (ASiR-V 30%).Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included 58 patients who underwent LDCT scan for lung cancer screening. Datasets were reconstructed with ASiR-V 30% and DLIR at medium and high levels (DLIR-M and DLIR-H, respectively). The objective image signal and noise, which represented mean attenuation value and standard deviation in Hounsfield units for the lungs, mediastinum, liver, and background air, and subjective image contrast, image noise, and conspicuity of structures were evaluated. The differences between CT scan images subjected to ASiR-V 30%, DLIR-M, and DLIR-H were evaluated.Results: Based on the objective analysis, the image signals did not significantly differ among ASiR-V 30%, DLIR-M, and DLIR-H (p = 0.949, 0.737, 0.366, and 0.358 in the lungs, mediastinum, liver, and background air, respectively). However, the noise was significantly lower in DLIR-M and DLIR-H than in ASiR-V 30% (all p < 0.001). DLIR had higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) than ASiR-V 30% (p = 0.027, < 0.001, and < 0.001 in the SNR of the lungs, mediastinum, and liver, respectively; all p < 0.001 in the CNR). According to the subjective analysis, DLIR had higher image contrast and lower image noise than ASiR-V 30% (all p < 0.001). DLIR was superior to ASiR-V 30% in identifying the pulmonary arteries and veins, trachea and bronchi, lymph nodes, and pleura and pericardium (all p < 0.001).Conclusion: DLIR significantly reduced the image noise in chest LDCT scan images compared with ASiR-V 30% while maintaining superior image quality."

This approach is built on top of two-stage object detection deep learning algorithm called Faster R-CNN with a major modification of using rotated bounding box. The use of rotated bounding box plays a key role in the future work to overcome several inherent difficulties of fracture segmentation relating to the heterogeneity of uninterested background (i.e., minerals) and the variation in size and shape of fracture. Comparing to the commonly used bounding box (i.e., axis-align bounding box), rotated bounding box shows a greater adaptability to fit with the elongated shape of fracture, such that minimizing the ratio of background within the bounding box. Besides, an additional benefit of rotated bounding box is that it can provide relative information on the orientation and length of fracture without the further segmentation and measurement step. To validate the applicability of the proposed approach, we train and test our approach with a number of CT image sets of fractured granite specimens with highly heterogeneous background and other rocks such as sandstone and shale. The result demonstrates that our approach can lead to the encouraging results on fracture detection with the mean average precision (mAP) up to 0.89 and also outperform the conventional approach in terms of background-to-object ratio within the bounding box."
Deep learning can contrast the minimal pairs of syntactic data,2021,"['deep learning', 'BERT', 'syntactic judgment', 'minimal pair', 'contrast']",,"The present work aims to assess the feasibility of using deep learning as a useful tool to investigate syntactic phenomena. To this end, the present study concerns three research questions: (i) whether deep learning can detect syntactically inappropriate constructions, (ii) whether deep learning’s acceptability judgments are accountable, and (iii) whether deep learning’s aspects of acceptability judgments are similar to human judgments. As a proxy for a deep learning language model, this study chooses BERT. The current paper comprises syntactically contrasted pairs of English sentences which come from the three test suites already available. The first one is 196 grammatical -ungrammatical minimal pairs from DeKeyser (2000). The second one is examples in four published syntax textbooks excerpted from Warstadt et al. (2019). The last one is extracted from Sprouse et al. (2013), which collects the examples reported in a theoretical linguistics journal, Linguistic Inquiry. The BERT models, base BERT and large BERT, are assessed by judging acceptability of items in the test suites with an evaluation metric, surprisal, which is used to measure how ‘surprised’ a model is when encountering a word in a sequence of words, i.e., a sentence. The results are analyzed in the two frameworks: directionality and repulsion. The results of directionality reveals that the two versions of BERT are overall competent at distinguishing ungrammatical sentences from grammatical ones. The statistical results of both repulsion and directionality also reveal that the two variants of BERT do not differ significantly. Regarding repulsion, correct judgments and incorrect ones are significantly different. Additionally, the repulsion of the first test suite, which is excerpted from the items for testing learners’ grammaticality judgments, is higher than the other test suites, which are excerpted from the syntax textbooks and published literature. This study compares BERT’s acceptability judgments with magnitude estimation results reported in Sprouse et al. (2013) in order to examine if deep learning’s syntactic knowledge is akin to human knowledge. The error analyses on incorrectly judged items reveal that there are some syntactic constructions that the two BERTs have trouble learning, which indicates that BERT’s acceptability judgments are distributed not randomly."

Effectiveness of Transfer Learning for Deep Learning-Based Electrocardiogram Analysis,2021,"['Electrocardiography', 'Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning', 'Arrhythmia', 'Classification']",,"Objectives: Many deep learning-based predictive models evaluate the waveforms of electrocardiograms (ECGs). Becausedeep learning-based models are data-driven, large and labeled biosignal datasets are required. Most individual researchersfind it difficult to collect adequate training data. We suggest that transfer learning can be used to solve this problem and increasethe effectiveness of biosignal analysis. Methods: We applied the weights of a pretrained model to another model thatperformed a different task (i.e., transfer learning). We used 2,648,100 unlabeled 8.2-second-long samples of ECG II data topretrain a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and employed the CAE to classify 12 ECG rhythms within a dataset, which had10,646 10-second-long 12-lead ECGs with 11 rhythm labels. We split the datasets into training and test datasets in an 8:2 ratio.To confirm that transfer learning was effective, we evaluated the performance of the classifier after the proposed transferlearning, random initialization, and two-dimensional transfer learning as the size of the training dataset was reduced. Allexperiments were repeated 10 times using a bootstrapping method. The CAE performance was evaluated by calculating themean squared errors (MSEs) and that of the ECG rhythm classifier by deriving F1-scores. Results: The MSE of the CAE was626.583. The mean F1-scores of the classifiers after bootstrapping of 100%, 50%, and 25% of the training dataset were 0.857,0.843, and 0.835, respectively, when the proposed transfer learning was applied and 0.843, 0.831, and 0.543, respectively, afterrandom initialization was applied.

To address the first, our models are evaluated by judging every item in Test Suite I, which comprises learner and native sentences from four sources. The results show that the models predict nativelikeness reasonably well. Next, syntactic well-formedness is examined via Test Suite II, comprising correct–incorrect minimal pairs with two conditions. The results indicate that our models do not satisfactorily detect it. The learners’ results reveal their limited knowledge, suggesting that the models learn the inadequateness of lexical associations as a feature of non-nativelikeness because the learner training data comprises Korean English learner corpora. However, our models’ results also show poor performance. We conclude that deep learning is capable of measuring nativelikeness, and well-formedness and lexical associations are no more than necessary conditions for nativelikeness. This implies the need to consider other factors when defining and assessing nativelikeness."

As the number of senior citizens living alone increases, emotion robots that can interact with them and other emotion robots are becoming increasingly important. Existing emotion robots usually recognized emotion through images of the user’s facial expressions or voice signals. However, there are many situations where the user’s emotions cannot read under various environments. Therefore, research on recognizing the user’s emotions through ECG signals among different biomedical signals is actively being conducted. The proposed method converts ECG signals into various types of two-dimensional time-scale representations. We then designed a four-stream deep learning model by applying it to an ensemble form and transfer learning. Finally, an experiment was conducted using the ASCERTAIN sentiment database. This database contains data recorded by 58 people with 9 different emotions. Among these emotions, we used six representatives (surprise, happiness, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness). The experimental results revealed that the presented ensemble deep models showed good performance in comparison with each single deep model and the original model without transformation."
Identifying the Mating Posture of Cattle Using Deep Learning-Based Object Detection with Networks of Various Settings,2021,['Cattle  · Deep learning network  · Estrus  · Mish activation function  · Mating posture  · Object detection'],,"Estrus detection in cattle is an important factor in livestock farming. With timely estrus detection, cattle are artifi cially fertilized and isolated for safety, which directly aff ects the productivity of livestock farms. Estrus can be successfully detected by identifying the mating posture of cattle. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the identifi cation of cattle mating posture based on video inputs for prompt estrus detection. A deep learning-based object detection network that focuses on real-time processing with high processing speeds is applied. The use of deep learning-based object detection shows high accuracy, even with noise robustness. The performance of the network is improved through the inclusion of an additional layer and a new activation function. The composition of the additional layer enables training by extracting more features required for object detection. The application of the new activation function, Mish, which has a smoother curve, allows for better generalization and improves the accuracy of the results. The data needed for training were gathered by installing cameras at a livestock farm, and various datasets were used depending on camera placement. The results of this study were verifi ed by the evaluation of four networks using test datasets containing image and video data from diff erent environments. The identifi cation of the mating posture of cattle attained 98.5% precision, 97.2% recall, and 97.8% accuracy."

We have designed our model to split the color channels and extract deep features from these individual channels rather than single combined channel with the help of Efficient NET B3. These features from different channels are fused by using feature fusion module designed as a layer and placed before dense layers of Efficient NET. The experiments were performed on our own dataset collected from hospitals. We also performed experiments of BreakHis, and ICML datasets to evaluate our model. The results produced by our model are very good as compared to previously reported results."

A Mask Wearing Detection System Based on Deep Learning,2021,"['Mask wearing detection system', 'Deep learning', 'Image detection', 'Video detection', 'Real-time detection']",,"COVID-19 has dramatically changed people's daily life. Wearing masks is considered as a simple but effective way to defend the spread of the epidemic. Hence, a real-time and accurate mask wearing detection system is important. In this paper, a deep learning-based mask wearing detection system is developed to help people defend against the terrible epidemic. The system consists of three important functions, which are image detection, video detection and real-time detection. To keep a high detection rate, a deep learning-based method is adopted to detect masks. Unfortunately, according to the suddenness of the epidemic, the mask wearing dataset is scarce, so a mask wearing dataset is collected in this paper. Besides, to reduce the computational cost and runtime, a simple online and real-time tracking method is adopted to achieve video detection and monitoring. Furthermore, a function is implemented to call the camera to real-time achieve mask wearing detection. The sufficient results have shown that the developed system can perform well in the mask wearing detection task. The precision, recall, mAP and F1 can achieve 86.6%, 96.7%, 96.2% and 91.4%, respectively."

Prediction of Patient Management in COVID-19 Using Deep Learning-Based Fully Automated Extraction of Cardiothoracic CT Metrics and Laboratory Findings,2021,"['COVID-19', 'Computed tomography', 'Deep learning', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Patient management']",,"Objective: To extract pulmonary and cardiovascular metrics from chest CTs of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using a fully automated deep learning-based approach and assess their potential to predict patient management.Materials and Methods: All initial chest CTs of patients who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at our emergency department between March 25 and April 25, 2020, were identified (n = 120). Three patient management groups were defined: group 1 (outpatient), group 2 (general ward), and group 3 (intensive care unit [ICU]). Multiple pulmonary and cardiovascular metrics were extracted from the chest CT images using deep learning. Additionally, six laboratory findings indicating inflammation and cellular damage were considered. Differences in CT metrics, laboratory findings, and demographics between the patient management groups were assessed. The potential of these parameters to predict patients’ needs for intensive care (yes/no) was analyzed using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curves. Internal and external validity were assessed using 109 independent chest CT scans.Results: While demographic parameters alone (sex and age) were not sufficient to predict ICU management status, both CT metrics alone (including both pulmonary and cardiovascular metrics; area under the curve [AUC] = 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.79–0.97) and laboratory findings alone (C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, white blood cell count, and albumin; AUC = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.77–0.94) were good classifiers. Excellent performance was achieved by a combination of demographic parameters, CT metrics, and laboratory findings (AUC = 0.91; 95% CI = 0.85–0.98). Application of a model that combined both pulmonary CT metrics and demographic parameters on a dataset from another hospital indicated its external validity (AUC = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.66–0.88).Conclusion: Chest CT of patients with COVID-19 contains valuable information that can be accessed using automated image analysis. These metrics are useful for the prediction of patient management."
Detection and tracking for the awareness of surroundings of a ship based on deep learning,2021,"['ship awareness', 'object detection', 'deep learning', 'object tracking', 'Kalman filter']",,"To prevent maritime accidents, it is crucial to be aware of the surrounding environment near ships. The images recorded by a camera mounted on a ship could be used for the awareness of other ships surrounding it. In this study, ship awareness was performed using three procedures: detection, localization, and tracking. Initially, ship detection was performed using the deep learning-based detection model, YOLO (You Only Look Once) v3, based on the camera image. A virtual image dataset was constructed using Unity to overcome the difficulty of obtaining camera images onboard with various sizes of ships, and to improve the detection performance. This was followed by the localization procedure in which the position of the horizon on the image was calculated using the orientation information from the ship. Subsequently, the position of the detected ship in the spatial coordinate system was calculated using the horizon information. Following this, the position, course over ground, and speed over ground of the target ships were tracked in the time domain using the extended Kalman filter. A deep learning model that determines the heading of the ship in the image was proposed to utilize abundant information of cameras, and it was used to set the initial value of the Kalman filter. Finally, the proposed method for the awareness of ships was validated using an actual video captured from a camera installed on an actual ship with various encountering scenarios. The tracking results were compared with actual automatic identification system data obtained from other ships. As a result, the entire detection, localization, and tracking procedures showed good performance, and it was estimated that the proposed method for the awareness of the surroundings of a ship, based on camera images, could be used in the future."

This study organized student-based assessment; self-assessment (SA) and peer-assessment (PA). SPSS 25 was conducted for the correlation and reliability analysis of SA and PA, and the evaluation of linguistic improvement. The results indicate that the H-STEAM facilitating PBL can be more workable through openness and community caring. The integration of collaborative and conceptual learning through PBL can empower learners’ autonomy and produce deeper thoughts, which can contribute to deep learning.

Damage detection in structures using modal curvatures gapped smoothing method and deep learning,2021,"['damage detections', 'vibration-based', 'gapped smoothing method (GSM)', 'machine learning', 'deep learning', 'convolutional neural network', 'Finite Element Method (FEM)']",,"This paper deals with damage detection using a Gapped Smoothing Method (GSM) combined with deep learning. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a model of deep learning. CNN has an input layer, an output layer, and a number of hidden layers that consist of convolutional layers. The input layer is a tensor with shape (number of images) × (image width) × (image height) × (image depth). An activation function is applied each time to this tensor passing through a hidden layer and the last layer is the fully connected layer. After the fully connected layer, the output layer, which is the final layer, is predicted by CNN. In this paper, a complete machine learning system is introduced. The training data was taken from a Finite Element (FE) model. The input images are the contour plots of curvature gapped smooth damage index. A free-free beam is used as a case study. In the first step, the FE model of the beam was used to generate data. The collected data were then divided into two parts, i.e. 70% for training and 30% for validation. In the second step, the proposed CNN was trained using training data and then validated using available data. Furthermore, a vibration experiment on steel damaged beam in free-free support condition was carried out in the laboratory to test the method. A total number of 15 accelerometers were set up to measure the mode shapes and calculate the curvature gapped smooth of the damaged beam. Two scenarios were introduced with different severities of the damage. The results showed that the trained CNN was successful in detecting the location as well as the severity of the damage in the experimental damaged beam."
Cerebral hemorrhage detection and localization with medical imaging for cerebrovascular disease diagnosis and treatment using explainable deep learning,2021,['Cerebral hemorrhage prediction · Cerebrovascular disease · Explainable artificial intelligence'],,"Cerebral hemorrhages require rapid diagnosis and intensive treatment. This study aimed to detect cerebral hemorrhages and their locations in images using a deep learning model applying explainable deep learning. Normal brain images with no hemorrhages and images with subarachnoid, intraventricular, subdural, epidural, and intraparenchymal hemorrhages according to computed tomography (CT) (n = 200) were analyzed. A ResNet deep learning model, including image processing, was utilized. The visual explanation from a heatmap was made at the hemorrhage location using a gradient-class activation map (Grad-CAM). To evaluate the performance of the deep learning system, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were determined. A hemorrhage prediction system for images of normal brains and brains with subarachnoid, intraventricular, subdural, epidural, and intraparenchymal hemorrhages was built. The Grad-CAM representation indicated the location of the hemorrhages in these images. In the prediction results, accurate predictions of the hemorrhage areas were made and visualizations of the corresponding locations overlapped in the images within (− 4, 1) pixel difference. The evaluation of the system performance showed an accuracy of 0.81 with a sensitivity of 0.67 and specificity of 0.86. These results constitue a proof of concept for the use of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to detect cerebral hemorrhages and visualize their locations in medical images, which will allow rapid diagnosis and treatment."

Deep Learning-Based Algorithm for the Detection and Characterization of MRI Safety of Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices on Chest Radiographs,2021,"['Cardiac implantable electronic device', 'Deep learning', 'Implantable cardioverter defibrillator', 'Pacemaker', 'Radiography']",,"Objective: With the recent development of various MRI-conditional cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), the accurate identification and characterization of CIEDs have become critical when performing MRI in patients with CIEDs. We aimed to develop and evaluate a deep learning-based algorithm (DLA) that performs the detection and characterization of parameters, including MRI safety, of CIEDs on chest radiograph (CR) in a single step and compare its performance with other related algorithms that were recently developed.Materials and Methods: We developed a DLA (X-ray CIED identification [XCID]) using 9912 CRs of 958 patients with 968 CIEDs comprising 26 model groups from 4 manufacturers obtained between 2014 and 2019 from one hospital.

Deep Learning with Data Augmentation to Add Data Around Classification Boundaries,2021,"['Image Classification', 'Data Augmentation', 'Convolutional Neural Network', 'Generative Adversarial Networks']",,"Data augmentation methods are used as a technique to improve generalization by increasing the number of training data in image classification. However, most of these methods are not a data driven algorithm, the degree of improvement of generalization ability by performing these data augmentation methods differs between the domains of image data for training. Generative models are researched to use for augmenting data recently. In particular, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) that can generate clean image get attention as an excellent innovation in machine learning. As GANs extension method, there is a method called CGANs (Mirza and Osindero, 2014) that can be used for data augmentation. When enough training data for each class are not prepared for classification model, the same is true for training CGANs. In such case, CGAN generates noisy images. This makes a classification model to underfit to the original training data. Moreover, when a CGAN approximates the training data distribution, the CGAN generates new training data in the same region where training data densely exist. In such case, augmented data can’t reduce overfitting on the original training data. Therefore, our research contributes to augment data which meets these two requirements. In this study, we propose a method to generate data by the class specific GAN with small training data and selectively add generated data to the training data set that improves classification accuracy by using the entropy of the classification model. The feature of the proposed method is that it focuses on the positional relationship between data and the classification hyperplane in deep learning. In the proposed method, the entropy of the classification model is used to measure the positional relationship between the classification boundary and the data. As a result, the generalization performance is improved by adding the data around the classification boundary as new training data."

Utilization of a deep learning-based fuel consumption model in choosing a liner shipping route for container ships in Asia,2021,"['Asymmetric traveling salesman problem', 'Ship fuel consumption model', 'Liner shipping', 'Route choice optimization', 'Deep-learning neural network', 'Container ships']",,"Designating the ideal shipping route can spare expenses, enlarge profits and improve the competitiveness of shipping companies. Liner shipping route choice is mainly contingent on fuel cost, which always contributes the major proportion of the ship’s operating cost.

Diagnostic Performance of Deep Learning-Based Lesion Detection Algorithm in CT for Detecting Hepatic Metastasis from Colorectal Cancer,2021,"['Artificial intelligence', 'Colorectal neoplasms', 'Neoplasm metastasis', 'X-ray computed tomography', 'Computer-assisted diagnosis']",,"Objective: To compare the performance of the deep learning-based lesion detection algorithm (DLLD) in detecting liver metastasis with that of radiologists.Materials and Methods: This clinical retrospective study used 4386-slice computed tomography (CT) images and labels from a training cohort (502 patients with colorectal cancer [CRC] from November 2005 to December 2010) to train the DLLD for detecting liver metastasis, and used CT images of a validation cohort (40 patients with 99 liver metastatic lesions and 45 patients without liver metastasis from January 2011 to December 2011) for comparing the performance of the DLLD with that of readers (three abdominal radiologists and three radiology residents). For per-lesion binary classification, the sensitivity and false positives per patient were measured.Results: A total of 85 patients with CRC were included in the validation cohort. In the comparison based on per-lesion binary classification, the sensitivity of DLLD (81.82%, [81/99]) was comparable to that of abdominal radiologists (80.81%, p = 0.80) and radiology residents (79.46%, p = 0.57). However, the false positives per patient with DLLD (1.330) was higher than that of abdominal radiologists (0.357, p < 0.001) and radiology residents (0.667, p < 0.001).Conclusion: DLLD showed a sensitivity comparable to that of radiologists when detecting liver metastasis in patients initially diagnosed with CRC. However, the false positives of DLLD were higher than those of radiologists. Therefore, DLLD could serve as an assistant tool for detecting liver metastasis instead of a standalone diagnostic tool."
Clinical Validation of a Deep Learning-Based Hybrid (Greulich-Pyle and Modified Tanner-Whitehouse) Method for Bone Age Assessment,2021,"['Artificial intelligence', 'Convolutional neural network', 'Bone age assessment', 'Greulich-Pyle method', 'Tanner-Whitehouse method']",,"Objective: To evaluate the accuracy and clinical efficacy of a hybrid Greulich-Pyle (GP) and modified Tanner-Whitehouse (TW) artificial intelligence (AI) model for bone age assessment.Materials and Methods: A deep learning-based model was trained on an open dataset of multiple ethnicities. A total of 102 hand radiographs (51 male and 51 female; mean age ± standard deviation = 10.95 ± 2.37 years) from a single institution were selected for external validation. Three human experts performed bone age assessments based on the GP atlas to develop a reference standard. Two study radiologists performed bone age assessments with and without AI model assistance in two separate sessions, for which the reading time was recorded. The performance of the AI software was assessed by comparing the mean absolute difference between the AI-calculated bone age and the reference standard. The reading time was compared between reading with and without AI using a paired t test. Furthermore, the reliability between the two study radiologists’ bone age assessments was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), and the results were compared between reading with and without AI.Results: The bone ages assessed by the experts and the AI model were not significantly different (11.39 ± 2.74 years and 11.35 ± 2.76 years, respectively, p = 0.31). The mean absolute difference was 0.39 years (95% confidence interval, 0.33– 0.45 years) between the automated AI assessment and the reference standard. The mean reading time of the two study radiologists was reduced from 54.29 to 35.37 seconds with AI model assistance (p < 0.001). The ICC of the two study radiologists slightly increased with AI model assistance (from 0.945 to 0.990).Conclusion: The proposed AI model was accurate for assessing bone age. Furthermore, this model appeared to enhance the clinical efficacy by reducing the reading time and improving the inter-observer reliability"
작업 자세 평가를 위한 Vector-based 및 Deep Learning-based OWAS 평가 시스템 개발,2021,"['OWAS', 'Musculoskeletal disorders', 'Ergonomic risk assessment', 'Deep learning']",,"Objective: This study was intended to develop two risk assessment systems that can evaluate OWAS scores and action level with good accuracy and reliability to prevent work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs).Background: Since risk assessment methods such as OWAS and REBA are relied on visual observations, their accuracy and reliability might have been in questions. Therefore, computer-aided risk assessment systems are necessary to enhance accuracy and reliability as well as to improve applicability in workplaces.Method: This study developed vector-based OWAS (V-OWAS) and deep learning-based OWAS (DL-OWAS). V-OWAS (partial automation) asks a user to manually identify the key joint positions from a working picture and automatically calculates OWAS scores and action level. DL-OWAS (high automation) automatically identifies the key positions and determines OWAS scores and action level. To evaluate the performance of the two systems, we used 40 working pictures and compared the results of the two systems with the results of four ergonomic experts with over 10-year experience who did assess based on traditional visual observations.Results: The two systems showed similar assessment results with those obtained from the ergonomic experts. The agreement percentage of V-OWAS (91.3%) with the experts was slightly better than DL-OWAS (90%). On the other hand, the usability score of DL-OWAS (7 out of 7 point Likert scale) was significantly higher than V-OWAS (5.75) and traditional visual observation (5.25).Conclusion: V-OWAS had an advantage in accuracy of identifying the key joint positions; but it required more time and efforts over DL-OWAS. DL-OWAS can assess automatically; but its accuracy might be low if some parts of the body are obscured due to some reasons (e.g., obscured by some machine). Therefore, it is recommended to use V-OWAS or DL-OWAS according to the condition of working picture.Application: The two OWAS systems developed in this study can help industrial practitioners effectively and efficiently assess working posture for preventing WMSDs."
Deep learning-based oil spill detection with LWIR camera,2021,"['Oil spill detection', 'YOLO', 'Object detection', 'Infrared imaging']",,"The ocean covers approximately 71% of the total surface area of Earth and plays a significant role in maintaining the envi-ronment and ecosystems. Oil spills are the largest source of pollution in the ocean, mainly Bunker C oil and diesel oil used as vessel fuels. Therefore, oil spill detection is essential for marine protection, which motivated this study. Detection with radar, which is based on electromagnetic waves, is achieved using satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR); thus, real-time detection over a small range is difficult. Hence, in this study, an oil spill detection system based on thermal imaging using a long-wave infrared (LWIR) camera is proposed. The oil spill detection algorithm utilizes the You Only Look Once (YOLO) model, which is widely used for object detection. In addition, 1,644 thermal images were labeled to evaluate the proposed system. The training and test results showed an accuracy of 96.91% and false alarm rate of 8.33%. An improved detection performance can be expected from subsequent experiments using larger image datasets."

The proposed method reduces the time required for quadtree computation by downscaling the smoke simulation data used as input data.

The data used for training is the COCO 2017 Dataset, and the artificial neural network uses a VGG19-based network.

Study of the quantitative evaluation factors for a deep learning-based improved magnetic resonance imaging,2021,['Evaluation factor · Traditional-GAN · Cyclic-GAN'],,"Our research focused on the feasibility of improving the low-field T2 magnetic resonance (MR) images in terms of using a complex and in-depth learning-related algorithm. Set of unpaired images (T2-weighted 0.06 T MR image and 1.5 T MR image for separate individuals) were utilized in two clinical trials/sequences. The trials were conducted to identify deformations in a 1.5 T MR image according to the 0.06 T MR image to fit the image and size of the unpaired set. Afterwards, the cyclic-generative adversarial network (GAN) was applied to produce an artificial MR image of the 0.06 T MR image with reference to the original or the deformed 1.5 T MR image. In the end, an improved 0.06 T MR image was produced using the traditional GAN supplemented by the artificial MR image. T2 and flair MR images were verified for matching T1 and T2 testing models in the context of the traditional GAN. The outcomes relating to the optimized trial based on the improved MR image indicated a measurable improvement of the signal with a positive relationship between the original and the improved images. Quantitative variables were applied to assess the quality of the images, along with other settings, such as the signal improvement ratio and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), as well as the variable between the original and the improved MR images.

Deep learning convolutional neural network algorithms for the early detection and diagnosis of dental caries on periapical radiographs: A systematic review,2021,"['Deep Learning', 'Neural Network Models', 'Dental Caries', 'Radiography', 'Dental']",,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to analyse and review deep learning convolutional neural networks for detecting and diagnosing early-stage dental caries on periapical radiographs. Materials and Methods: In order to conduct this review, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses(PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Studies published from 2015 to 2021 under the keywords(deep convolutional neural network) AND (caries), (deep learning caries) AND (convolutional neural network) AND (caries) were systematically reviewed. Results: When dental caries is improperly diagnosed, the lesion may eventually invade the enamel, dentin, and pulp tissue, leading to loss of tooth function. Rapid and precise detection and diagnosis are vital for implementing appropriate prevention and treatment of dental caries. Radiography and intraoral images are considered to play a vital role in detecting dental caries; nevertheless, studies have shown that 20% of suspicious areas are mistakenly diagnosed as dental caries using this technique; hence, diagnosis via radiography alone without an objective assessment is inaccurate. Identifying caries with a deep convolutional neural network-based detector enables the operator to distinguish changes in the location and morphological features of dental caries lesions. Deep learning algorithms have broader and more profound layers and are continually being developed, remarkably enhancing their precision in detecting and segmenting objects. Conclusion: Clinical applications of deep learning convolutional neural networks in the dental field have shown significant accuracy in detecting and diagnosing dental caries, and these models hold promise in supporting dental practitioners to improve patient outcomes."

A fully deep learning model for the automatic identification of cephalometric landmarks,2021,"['Anatomic Landmarks', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Dental Digital Radiography', 'Deep Learning', 'Neural Network Models']",,"Purpose: This study aimed to propose a fully automatic landmark identification model based on a deep learning algorithm using real clinical data and to verify its accuracy considering inter-examiner variability. Materials and Methods: In total, 950 lateral cephalometric images from Yonsei Dental Hospital were used. Two calibrated examiners manually identified the 13 most important landmarks to set as references. The proposed deep learning model has a 2-step structure-a region of interest machine and a detection machine-each consisting of 8 convolution layers, 5 pooling layers, and 2 fully connected layers. The distance errors of detection between 2 examiners were used as a clinically acceptable range for performance evaluation. Results: The 13 landmarks were automatically detected using the proposed model. Inter-examiner agreement for all landmarks indicated excellent reliability based on the 95% confidence interval. The average clinically acceptable range for all 13 landmarks was 1.24 mm. The mean radial error between the reference values assigned by 1 expert and the proposed model was 1.84 mm, exhibiting a successful detection rate of 36.1%. The A-point, the incisal tip of the maxillary and mandibular incisors, and ANS showed lower mean radial error than the calibrated expert variability. Conclusion: This experiment demonstrated that the proposed deep learning model can perform fully automatic identification of cephalometric landmarks and achieve better results than examiners for some landmarks. It is meaningful to consider between-examiner variability for clinical applicability when evaluating the performance of deep learning methods in cephalometric landmark identification."
Use of Deep Learning Image Classification Models and Vehicle Mounted Cameras for Automatic Pavement Pothole Detection,2021,"['Pavement Distress Detection', 'Urgent Maintenance', 'Deep Learning Image Classification', 'Vehicle Mounted Camera']",,"PURPOSES : This study uses deep learning image classification models and vehicle-mounted cameras to detect types of pavement distress — such as potholes, spalling, punch-outs, and patching damage — which require urgent maintenance. METHODS : For the automatic detection of pavement distress, the optimal mount location on a vehicle for a regular action camera was first determined. Using the orthogonal projection of obliquely captured surface images, morphological operations, and multi-blob image processing, candidate distressed pavement images were extracted from road surface images of a 16,036 km in-lane distance. Next, the distressed pavement images classified by experts were trained and tested for evaluation by three deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) models: GoogLeNet, AlexNet, and VGGNet. The CNN models were image classification tools used to identify and extract the combined features of the target images via deep layers. Here, a data augmentation technique was applied to produce big distress data for training. Third, the dimensions of the detected distressed pavement patches were computed to estimate the quantity of repair materials needed. RESULTS : It was found that installing cameras 1.8 m above the ground on the exterior rear of the vehicle could provide clear pavement surface images with a resolution of 1 cm per pixel. The sensitivity analysis results of the trained GoogLeNet, AlexNet, and VGGNet models were 93 %, 86 %, and 72 %, respectively, compared to 62.7 % for the dimensional computation. Following readjustment of the image categories in the GoogLeNet model, distress detection sensitivity increased to 94.6 %. CONCLUSIONS : These findings support urgent maintenance by sending the detected distressed pavement images with the dimensions of the distressed patches and GPS coordinates to local maintenance offices in real-time."

Further, this study introduces a novel methodology of combining deep learning methods and physics-based models to leverage their complementary strengths. To the best of the author’s knowledge, theory-guided deep learning prediction model was never used to predict viscosity before. The theory-guided deep neural networks (TGDNN) model is trained by minimizing the mean square error (MSE) and regularization terms using Adam optimization technique. The investigations reveal that the values of R2, RMSE, and AARD% are, respectively, 0.999868, 0.001143, and 2.198887 on experimental testing dataset. The TGDNN model learns non-linear relationship among the input variables from the training data. Additionally, the results show that the proposed method performed better than the other well-known existing theoretical and computer-aided models to predict the viscosity in wide range with high level of accuracy."

Deep learning approach for the segmentation of aneurysmal ascending aorta,2021,['Deep learning Segmentation Aorta Aneurysm Aortic valve'],,"Diagnosis of ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (ATAA) is based on the measurement of the maximum aortic diameter,but size is not a good predictor of the risk of adverse events. There is growing interest in the development of novel imagederivedrisk strategies to improve patient risk management towards a highly individualized level. In this study, the feasibilityand efficacy of deep learning for the automatic segmentation of ATAAs was investigated using UNet, ENet, and ERFNettechniques. Specifically, CT angiography done on 72 patients with ATAAs and different valve morphology (i.e., tricuspidaortic valve, TAV, and bicuspid aortic valve, BAV) were semi-automatically segmented with Mimics software (MaterializeNV, Leuven, Belgium), and then used for training of the tested deep learning models. The segmentation performance interms of accuracy and time inference were compared using several parameters. All deep learning models reported a dicescore higher than 88%, suggesting a good agreement between predicted and manual ATAA segmentation. We found that theENet and UNet are more accurate than ERFNet, with the ENet much faster than UNet. This study demonstrated that deeplearning models can rapidly segment and quantify the 3D geometry of ATAAs with high accuracy, thereby facilitating theexpansion into clinical workflow of personalized approach to the management of patients with ATAAs."

Image Denoising Method based on Deep Learning using Improved U-net,2021,"['Image denoising', 'Deep learning', 'U-net', 'New structure', 'Improved U-net']",,"Various methods, including block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D), have been proposed for image denoising. Recently, studies on deep learning methods for image denoising have been on the rise. In this paper, we propose a new structure for a deep neural network that improves image denoising performance. Among the existing deep neural networks, we improve U-net, which is widely used for image restoration, through the inclusion of pre-processing and post-processing and by modifying each of its stages. Extensive simulations show that the proposed structure performs very well for a wide range of noise levels with a single trained parameter, and it exhibits superior image denoising performance compared to conventional deep neural networks."
A Study on the Two-Dimensional Graph Data and Its Effectiveness in Human Behavior Classification Deep Learning,2021,"['CNN', 'image', 'deep learning', 'human behavior recognition', 'machine learning']",,"Recently, a lot of research has been conducted using machine learning technology in various fields. It also develops models by applying various learning techniques. We propose a method to develop a CNN model using a two-dimensional graph image, focusing on learning using CNN to process time series information faster than LSTM. Process the data to create a two-dimensional graph and use it for training AI models. It collects data on 4 specific motions with a 6-axis sensor (Arduino nano 33 ble) and creates a two-dimensional graph. The result of testing the model trained in this study is 99.6% accuracy. This was able to achieve higher accuracy than other studies that did not image the data. The difference from the time series data training model using other CNNs is that you can analyze all items in the graph from one kernel. Conventional methods make it difficult to convolution all items into one kernel. Additionally, through experiments with various parameters, inferences between parameters and results and optimal settings are suggested."
English Island Constraints Revisited:Experimental vs. Deep Learning Approach,2021,"['island constraint', 'experimental', 'deep learning', 'BERTLARGE', 'CoLA']",,"This paper examined English island constraints with a deep learning model and compared the analysis results with those of Lee and Park (2018). This paper adopted the BERTLARGE model which was pretrained with the CoLA dataset. The dataset which was used in the current study were composed of 480 sentences. Among them, 80 sentences came from the target sentences in Lee and Park (2018), and 400 sentences from the CoLA dataset. These 480 sentences were used as an input to the BERTLARGE model, and the acceptability scores were calculated. Unlike previous deep learning models for syntactic acceptability, however, this paper calculated the probability where the given sentence could be acceptable, and the probability was converted into the acceptability scores. After the acceptability scores were obtained for all the target sentences, they were normalized into the z-scores. Statistical analyses were applied to them to compare the results of the BERTLARGE model and the experimental results in Lee and Park (2018). As a result, it was found that the results of the BERTLARGE model showed patterns similar to those in Sprouse et al. (2012) and Lee and Park (2018). Through the analysis, the followings were observed: (i) deep learning models could represent human beings’ syntactic acceptability to a considerable extends, (ii) the BERTLARGE model clearly identified the English island constraints, and (iii) both main factors (Island and Location) and their interaction (Island:Location) influenced the acceptability scores of island sentences."
Comparison of Pre-processed Brain Tumor MR Images Using Deep Learning Detection Algorithms,2021,"['Brain Tumor', 'RetinaNet', 'Deep Learning', 'Histogram Equalization']",,"Detecting brain tumors of different sizes is a challenging task. This study aimed to identify brain tumors using detection algorithms. Most studies in this area use segmentation; however, we utilized detection owing to its advantages. Data were obtained from 64 patients and 11,200 MR images. The deep learning model used was RetinaNet, which is based on ResNet152. The model learned three different types of pre-processing images: normal, general histogram equalization, and contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE). The three types of images were compared to determine the pre-processing technique that exhibits the best performance in the deep learning algorithms. During pre-processing, we converted the MR images from DICOM to JPG format. Additionally, we regulated the window level and width. The model compared the pre-processed images to determine which images showed adequate performance; CLAHE showed the best performance, with a sensitivity of 81.79%. The RetinaNet model for detecting brain tumors through deep learning algorithms demonstrated satisfactory performance in finding lesions. In future, we plan to develop a new model for improving the detection performance using well-processed data. This study lays the groundwork for future detection technologies that can help doctors find lesions more easily in clinical tasks."
Understanding Which Images Degrade Deep Learning Classification Performance,2021,"['Adversarial examples', 'Machine learning and deep learning', 'Image classification', 'Computer vision']",,"In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown high success and accuracy in various classification tasks such as speech recognition, image classification, segmentation, etc. However, DNNs provide low classification performance when the train and test distributions differ (i.e., out-of-distribution). In this study, we investigate each visual characteristic of the correctly classified and misclassified images (referred to as natural adversarial examples) on CIFAR10 to understand which images substantially degrade machine learning and deep learning models’ classification performances. To verify this, we divide the classification results into two groups per class: correct prediction and incorrect prediction. Then, we compare the visual appearance (e.g., image point of view) of examples of correct predictions with those of incorrect predictions. Our experimental results demonstrated that correctly classified examples have several common visual characteristics, which differ from those of natural adversarial examples."

As well as image data, ConvXGB also supports the general classification problems, with a data preprocessing module. ConvXGB consists of several stacked convolutional layers to learn the features of the input and is able to learn features automatically, followed by XGBoost in the last layer for predicting the class labels. The ConvXGB model is simplified by reducing the number of parameters under appropriate conditions, since it is not necessary re-adjust the weight values in a back propagation cycle. Experiments on several data sets from UCL Repository, including images and general data sets, showed that our model handled the classification problems, for all the tested data sets, slightly better than CNN and XGBoost alone and was sometimes significantly better."

The purpose of this study was to develop a predictive model for the mitotic index of local primary GIST, based on deep learning algorithm.Materials and Methods: Abdominal contrast-enhanced CT images of 148 pathologically confirmed GIST cases were retrospectively collected for the development of a deep learning classification algorithm. The areas of GIST masses on the CT images were retrospectively labelled by an experienced radiologist. The postoperative pathological mitotic count was considered as the gold standard (high mitotic count, > 5/50 high-power fields [HPFs]; low mitotic count, ≤ 5/50 HPFs). A binary classification model was trained on the basis of the VGG16 convolutional neural network, using the CT images with the training set (n = 108), validation set (n = 20), and the test set (n = 20). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated at both, the image level and the patient level. The receiver operating characteristic curves were generated on the basis of the model prediction results and the area under curves (AUCs) were calculated. The risk categories of the tumors were predicted according to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology criteria.Results: At the image level, the classification prediction results of the mitotic counts in the test cohort were as follows: sensitivity 85.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.834–0.877), specificity 67.5% (95% CI: 0.636–0.712), PPV 82.1% (95% CI: 0.797–0.843), NPV 73.0% (95% CI: 0.691–0.766), and AUC 0.771 (95% CI: 0.750–0.791).

Suggestion of Building the AI Code of ETHICS through Deep Learning and Big Data Based AI,2021,"['AI Ethics', 'AI Code of Ethics', 'Deep Learning', 'Big Data', 'Human Ethics Experts']",,"Purpose: Current social and technical issues related AI Ethics take many different forms. Therefore, efforts to make ethical guidelines to cope with these issues are actively being developed. However, most kinds of ethical guidelines present general ethical principles and take a deductive method of solving individual problems in ac-cordance. The purpose of this study is to propose creating ethical guidelines through an inductive method of deriving ethical principles based on ethical judgements on each individual AI-related cases.Method: At first, most representative cases of AI ethics-related guidelines would be investigated in domestic and international level, with collecting documents and literature review. After that, examine the commonalities and differences between cases as these basic data through comparative research methods. Accordingly, it would be revealed that each case is constituted by a deductive method. Finally, as an alternative to these methods, presenting the merits of establishing ethical principles related to AI through inductive cases and specific examples.Results: Most of the representative AI Code of Ethics that currently exist have the form of suggesting principles and then solving ethical problems by applying the principles to the actual events accordingly. This type of approach corresponds to the method of ethics which based on moral principles. However, complex and unpre-dictable problems are likely to arise when it comes to AI ethics. In order to solve these problems, it is necessary to extract the principles of the AI Code of Ethics by establishing and presenting ethical principles through researching and analyzing various individual events related to AI Ethics using deep learning and Big Data Based AI.Conclusion: The following effects can be achieved by using deep learning techniques and Big Data Based AI that contains Ethical Issues together with sound and desirable Moral Judgement on each case, to derive the principles of the AI code of ethics. First, it is possible to extract and secure Big Data as basic resource of presenting Ethical Directions on various ethical problems arising in connection with the development of AI technology. Second, since the Ethical Principles as AI Code of Ethics are established based on empirical data, the validity of the principles can be secured. On the other hand, the AI Code of Ethics derived through deep learning based on such Big Data is likely to result in multiple tyranny or errors of majority due to certain limitations. So evaluation, verification and correction by Human Ethics Experts are essential to prevent these kinds of fault."
A High-Precision Feature Extraction Network of Fatigue Speech from Air Traffic Controller Radiotelephony Based on Improved Deep Learning,2021,"['Air traffic control', 'Fatigue', 'SSAE', 'Active learning', 'Dense block', 'Spectrogram']",,"Air traffic controller (ATC) fatigue is receiving considerable attention in recent studies because it represents a major cause of air traffic incidences. Research has revealed that the presence of fatigue can be detected by analysing speech utterances. However, constructing a complete labelled fatigue data set is very time-consuming. Moreover, a manually constructed speech collection will often contain only little key information to be used effectively in fatigue recognition, while multilevel deep models based on such speech materials often have overfitting problems due to an explosive increase of model parameters. To address these problems, a novel deep learning framework is proposed in this study to integrate active learning (AL) into complex speech features selected from a large set of unlabelled speech data in order to overcome the loss of information. A shallow feature set is first extracted using stacked sparse autoencoder networks, in which fatigue state challenge features from a manually selected speaker set of are exploited as the input vector. A densely connected convolutional autoencoder (DCAE) is then proposed to learn advanced features automatically from spectrograms of the selected data to supplement the fatigue features. The network can be effectively trained using a relatively small number of labelled samples with the help of AL sampling strategies, and the addition of a dense block to the convolutional automatic encoder can decrease the number of parameters and make the model easier to fit. Finally, the two above-mentioned features are combined using multiple kernel learning with a support-vector-machine classifier. A series of comparative experiments using the Civil Aviation Administration of China radiotelephony corpus demonstrates that the proposed method provides a significant improvement in the detection precision compared to current state-of-the-art approaches."

The newness of the recent modeling approaches and unfamiliarity with the model outputs may confuse some researchers and practitioners about the evaluation of the performance of such models. Methodological literacy to critically appraise the performance evaluation of the models and, ideally, the ability to conduct such an evaluation would be needed for those who want to develop models or apply them in practice. This article intends to provide intuitive, conceptual, and practical explanations of the statistical methods for evaluating the performance of survival prediction models with minimal usage of mathematical descriptions. It covers from conventional to deep learning methods, and emphasis has been placed on recent modeling approaches. This review article includes straightforward explanations of C indices (Harrell’s C index, etc.), timedependent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, calibration plot, other methods for evaluating the calibration performance, and Brier score."
Reproduction strategy of radiation data with compensation of data loss using a deep learning technique,2021,"['Deep learning', 'U-net algorithm', 'Radiation map', 'Sensor network system', 'Reproduction']",,"In nuclear-related facilities, such as nuclear power plants, research reactors, accelerators, and nuclear waste storage sites, radiation detection, and mapping are required to prevent radiation overexposure. Sensor network systems consisting of radiation sensor interfaces and wxireless communication units have become promising tools that can be used for data collection of radiation detection that can in turn be used to draw a radiation map. During data collection, malfunctions in some of the sensors can occasionally occur due to radiation effects, physical damage, network defects, sensor loss, or other reasons. This paper proposes a reproduction strategy for radiation maps using a U-net model to compensate for the loss of radiation detection data. To perform machine learning and verification, 1,561 simulations and 417 measured data of a sensor network were performed. The reproduction results show an accuracy of over 90%. The proposed strategy can offer an effective method that can be used to resolve the data loss problem for conventional sensor network systems and will specifically contribute to making initial responses with preserved data and without the high cost of radiation leak accidents at nuclear facilities."
Deep Learning Algorithm for Simultaneous Noise Reduction and Edge Sharpening in Low-Dose CT Images: A Pilot Study Using Lumbar Spine CT,2021,"['DL', 'Noise reduction', 'Lumbar spine', 'Computed tomography']",,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess whether a deep learning (DL) algorithm could enable simultaneous noise reduction and edge sharpening in low-dose lumbar spine CT.Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included 52 patients (26 male and 26 female; median age, 60.5 years) who had undergone CT-guided lumbar bone biopsy between October 2015 and April 2020. Initial 100-mAs survey images and 50-mAs intraprocedural images were reconstructed by filtered back projection. Denoising was performed using a vendor-agnostic DL model (ClariCT.AITM, ClariPI) for the 50-mAS images, and the 50-mAs, denoised 50-mAs, and 100-mAs CT images were compared. Noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and edge rise distance (ERD) for image sharpness were measured. The data were summarized as the mean ± standard deviation for these parameters. Two musculoskeletal radiologists assessed the visibility of the normal anatomical structures.Results: Noise was lower in the denoised 50-mAs images (36.38 ± 7.03 Hounsfield unit [HU]) than the 50-mAs (93.33 ± 25.36 HU) and 100-mAs (63.33 ± 16.09 HU) images (p < 0.001). The SNRs for the images in descending order were as follows: denoised 50-mAs (1.46 ± 0.54), 100-mAs (0.99 ± 0.34), and 50-mAs (0.58 ± 0.18) images (p < 0.001). The denoised 50-mAs images had better edge sharpness than the 100-mAs images at the vertebral body (ERD; 0.94 ± 0.2 mm vs. 1.05 ± 0.24 mm, p = 0.036) and the psoas (ERD; 0.42 ± 0.09 mm vs. 0.50 ± 0.12 mm, p = 0.002). The denoised 50-mAs images significantly improved the visualization of the normal anatomical structures (p < 0.001).Conclusion: DL-based reconstruction may enable simultaneous noise reduction and improvement in image quality with the preservation of edge sharpness on low-dose lumbar spine CT. Investigations on further radiation dose reduction and the clinical applicability of this technique are warranted."
Deep Learning Document Analysis System Based on Keyword Frequency and Section Centrality Analysis,2021,"['Deep learning', 'Document analysis', 'Keyword frequency', 'Keyword weight', 'Paragraph extraction']",,"Herein, we propose a document analysis system that analyzes papers or reports transformed into XML(Extensible Markup Language) format.

It maintains the order of the paragraphs containing the keywords and removes duplicated paragraphs. The frequency of the top-three keywords in the extracted paragraphs is re-verified, and the paragraphs are partitioned into 10 sections. Subsequently, the importance of the relevant areas is calculated and compared. By notifying the user of areas with the highest frequency and areas with higher importance than the average frequency, the user can read only the main content without reading all the contents. In addition, the number of paragraphs extracted through the deep learning model and the number of paragraphs in a section of high importance are predicted."

Deep learning for computer-assisted diagnosis of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer,2021,"['Machine learning', 'Pathology', 'Computer-assisted diagnosis', 'Stomach neoplasms', 'Deep learning']",,"Background: Patients with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer often undergo prophylactic gastrectomy to minimize cancer risk. Because intramucosal poorly cohesive carcinomas in this setting are typically not grossly visible, many pathologists assess the entire gastrectomy specimen microscopically. With 150 or more slides per case, this is a major time burden for pathologists. This study utilizes deep learning methods to analyze digitized slides and detect regions of carcinoma. Methods: Prophylactic gastrectomy specimens from seven patients with germline CDH1 mutations were analyzed (five for training/validation and two for testing, with a total of 133 tumor foci). All hematoxylin and eosin slides containing cancer foci were digitally scanned, and patches of size 256 × 256 pixels were randomly extracted from regions of cancer as well as from regions of normal background tissue, resulting in 15,851 images for training/validation and 970 images for testing. A model with DenseNet-169 architecture was trained for 150 epochs, then evaluated on images from the test set. External validation was conducted on 814 images scanned at an outside institution. Results: On individual patches, the trained model achieved a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9986. This enabled it to maintain a sensitivity of 90% with a false-positive rate of less than 0.1%. On the external validation dataset, the model achieved a similar ROC AUC of 0.9984. On whole slide images, the network detected 100% of tumor foci and correctly eliminated an average of 99.9% of the non-cancer slide area from consideration. Conclusions: Overall, our model shows encouraging progress towards computer-assisted diagnosis of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer."

A geometric deep learning approach for checking element-to-entity mappings in infrastructure building information models,2021,"['BIM', 'IFC', 'geometric deep learning', 'semantic integrity', 'infrastructure']",,"Data interoperability between domain-specific applications is a key prerequisite for building information modeling (BIM) to solidify its position as a central medium for collaboration and information sharing in the construction industry. The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) provides an open and neutral data format to standardize data exchanges in BIM, but is often exposed to data loss and misclassifications. Concretely, errors in mappings between BIM elements and IFC entities may occur due to manual omissions or the lack of awareness of the IFC schema itself, which is broadly defined and highly complex. This study explored the use of geometric deep learning models to classify infrastructure BIM elements, with the ultimate goal of automating the prechecking of BIM-to-IFC mappings. Two models with proven classification performance, Multi-View Convolutional Neural Network (MVCNN) and PointNet, were trained and tested to classify 10 types of commonly used BIM elements in road infrastructure, using a dataset of 1496 3D models. Results revealed MVCNN as the superior model with ACC and F1 score values of 0.98 and 0.98, compared with PointNet’s corresponding values of 0.83 and 0.87, respectively. MVCNN, which employs multiple images to learn the features of a 3D artifact, was able to discern subtle differences in their shapes and geometry. PointNet seems to lose the granularity of the shapes, as it uses points partially selected from point clouds."

Experimental results with real data sets demonstrate that the proposed scheme is able to effectively measure the emotional relationship between the main characters."

We developed a deep learning (DL) based model using a cohort representative of the Korean population.Methods This study was conducted on the basis of the National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening (NHIS-HEALS) cohort of Korea. Overall, 335,302 subjects without T2DM at baseline were included. We developed the model based on 80% of the subjects, and verified the power in the remainder. Predictive models for T2DM were constructed using the recurrent neural network long short-term memory (RNN-LSTM) network and the Cox longitudinal summary model. The performance of both models over a 10-year period was compared using a time dependent area under the curve.Results During a mean follow-up of 10.4±1.7 years, the mean frequency of periodic health check-ups was 2.9±1.0 per subject. During the observation period, T2DM was newly observed in 8.7% of the subjects. The annual performance of the model created using the RNN-LSTM network was superior to that of the Cox model, and the risk factors for T2DM, derived using the two models were similar; however, certain results differed.Conclusion The DL-based T2DM prediction model, constructed using a cohort representative of the population, performs better than the conventional model.

Quantitative Assessment of Chest CT Patterns in COVID-19 and Bacterial Pneumonia Patients: a Deep Learning Perspective,2021,"['COVID-19', 'Pneumonia', 'Bacterial', 'Computed Tomography', 'Deep Learning', 'Cluster Analysis']",,"Background: It is difficult to distinguish subtle differences shown in computed tomography (CT) images of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and bacterial pneumonia patients, which often leads to an inaccurate diagnosis. It is desirable to design and evaluate interpretable feature extraction techniques to describe the patient's condition.Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of 170 confirmed patients with COVID-19 or bacterial pneumonia acquired at Yeungnam University Hospital in Daegu, Korea. The lung and lesion regions were segmented to crop the lesion into 2D patches to train a classifier model that could differentiate between COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia. The K-means algorithm was used to cluster deep features extracted by the trained model into 20 groups.Each lesion patch cluster was described by a characteristic imaging term for comparison.For each CT image containing multiple lesions, a histogram of lesion types was constructed using the cluster information. Finally, a Support Vector Machine classifier was trained with the histogram and radiomics features to distinguish diseases and severity.Results: The 20 clusters constructed from 170 patients were reviewed based on common radiographic appearance types. Two clusters showed typical findings of COVID-19, with two other clusters showing typical findings related to bacterial pneumonia. Notably, there is one cluster that showed bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in the central and peripheral lungs and was considered to be a key factor for severity classification. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 91.2% for classifying COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia patients with 95% reported for severity classification. The CT quantitative parameters represented by the values of cluster 8 were correlated with existing laboratory data and clinical parameters.Conclusion: Deep chest CT analysis with constructed lesion clusters revealed well-known COVID-19 CT manifestations comparable to manual CT analysis. The constructed histogram features improved accuracy for both diseases and severity classification, and showed correlations with laboratory data and clinical parameters. The constructed histogram features can provide guidance for improved analysis and treatment of COVID-19."

A Systematic Implementation of Deepfake Multimedia Video Generation and Detection using Deep Learning,2021,,,"In the following years, technology has progressed in so many ways that it has provided the cyber society with a resource that only computers can excel at, such as the art of counterfeit of media, which was before unavailable. Deepfakes are a term used to describe this kind of deception. The majority of well-documented Deep Fakes are produced using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Models, which are essentially two distinct Machine Learning Models that perform the roles of attack and defence. These models create and identify deepfakes until they reach a point where the morphing no longer detects the deepfakes anymore. Using this algorithm/model, it is possible to discover and create new media that has a similar demographic to the training set, resulting in the development of the ideal Deep Fake media. Because the alterations are carried out utilising advanced characteristics, they cannot be seen with the human eye. However, it is completely feasible to develop an algorithm that can automatically identify this kind of tampering carried out via the internet. This not only enables us to broaden the scope of our search beyond a single media item, but also beyond a large library of mixed media. The more it learns, the better it becomes as artificial intelligence takes over in full force with automation. In order to create better deep fakes, new models are being developed all the time, making it more difficult to distinguish between genuine and morphing material."

HeartNetEC: a deep representation learning approach for ECG beat classifi cation,2021,['ECG Deep learning HeartNetEC Denoising segmentation Beat classification'],,"One of the most crucial and informative tools available at the disposal of a Cardiologist for examining the condition of apatient’s cardiovascular system is the electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG). A major reason behind the need for accurate reconstructionof ECG comes from the fact that the shape of ECG tracing is very crucial for determining the health condition ofan individual. Whether the patient is prone to or diagnosed with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), this information can begathered through examination of ECG signal. Among various other methods, one of the most helpful methods in identifyingcardiac abnormalities is a beat-wise categorization of a patient’s ECG record. In this work, a highly efficient deep representationlearning approach for ECG beat classification is proposed, which can significantly reduce the burden and time spentby a Cardiologist for ECG Analysis. This work consists of two sub-systems: denoising block and beat classification block.The initial block is a denoising block that acquires the ECG signal from the patient and denoises that. The next stage is thebeat classification part. This processes the input ECG signal for finding out the different classes of beats in the ECG throughan efficient algorithm. In both stages, deep learning-based methods have been employed for the purpose. Our proposedapproach has been tested on PhysioNet’s MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, for beat-wise classification into ten importanttypes of heartbeats.

As for trajectory learning algorithm, the CNN_Raw-RNN network structure is established, which is verified to be more effective than the original CNN_LSTM network structure. Besides, we propose an autonomous driving architecture of a pilot and copilot combination. The pilot is responsible for trajectory prediction via imitation learning with labeled driving trajectories, while the copilot is a safety module that is employed to verify the effectiveness of the vehicle trajectory by the results of the semantic segmentation auxiliary task. The proposed autonomous driving architecture is verified with a real car on urban roads without manual intervention within 40 km."

Given the spectrumreuse policy, three decisions having different timescales in such aD2D underlaid cache-enabled vehicular network were investigated:1) The decision on the cache-enabled vehicles for providing con tents, 2) power allocation for D2D users, and 3) power allocation forcellular vehicles. Since wireless link activation for video deliverycould introduce delays, node association is determined in a largertimescale compared to power allocations. We jointly optimize thesedelivery decisions by maximizing the average video quality underthe constraints on the playback delays of streaming users and thedata rate guarantees for cellular vehicles. Depending on the chan nel and queue states of users, the decision on the cache-enabledvehicle for video delivery is adaptively made based on the frame based Lyapunov optimization theory by comparing the expectedcosts of vehicles. For each cache-enabled vehicle, the expected costis obtained from the stochastic shortest path problem that is solvedby deep reinforcement learning without the knowledge of globalchannel state information. Specifically, the deep deterministic pol icy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is adopted for dealing with the verylarge state space, i.e., time-varying channel states.

We apply a reparametrization trick for the Bernoulli distribution for the discrete representations, which allows smooth backpropagation. In addition, our approach enables the separation of the encoder and decoder, which is necessary for compression tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end learning for a single audio compression model with RNNs, and our model achieves a Signal to Distortion Ratio (SDR) of 20.53dB."
Deep Q 학습 기반의 다중경로 시스템 경로 선택 알고리즘,2021,['TCP'],"다중경로 시스템은 유선망, LTE망, 위성망 등 다양한 망을 동시에 활용하여 데이터를 전송하는 시스템으로, 통신망의 전송속도, 신뢰도, 보안성 등을 높이기 위해 제안되었다. 본 논문에서는 이 시스템에서 각 망의 지연시간을 보상으로 하는 강화학습 기반 경로 선택 방안을 제안하고자 한다. 기존의 강화학습 모델과는 다르게, deep Q 학습을 이용하여 망의 변화하는 환경에 즉각적으로 대응하도록 알고리즘을 설계하였다. 네트워크 환경에서는 보상 정보를 일정 지연시간이 지나야 얻을 수 있으므로 이를 보정하는 방안 또한 함께 제안하였다. 성능을 평가하기 위해, 분산 데이터베이스와 텐서플로우 모듈 등을 포함한 테스트베드 학습 서버를 개발하였다. 시뮬레이션 결과, 제안 알고리즘이 RTT 감소 측면에서 최저 지연시간을 선택하는 방안보다 20% 가량 좋은 성능을 가지는 것을 확인하였다.",
수중운동체의 롤 제어를 위한 Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient 기반 강화학습,2021,['-'],,"The existing underwater vehicle controller design is applied by linearizing the nonlinear dynamics model to a specific motion section. Since the linear controller has unstable control performance in a transient state, various studies have been conducted to overcome this problem. Recently, there have been studies to improve the control performance in the transient state by using reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning can be largely divided into value-based reinforcement learning and policy-based reinforcement learning. In this paper, we propose the roll controller of underwater vehicle based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient(DDPG) that learns the control policy and can show stable control performance in various situations and environments. The performance of the proposed DDPG based roll controller was verified through simulation and compared with the existing PID and DQN with Normalized Advantage Functions based roll controllers."

This study aimed to explore the meaning of LbT as an important learning activity for future implementation in education. LbT is based on the cultural historical activity theory and sociocultural learning theory, as developed by scholars including Vygotsky. These frameworks value the construction of meaning based on language, and LbT is reported to be effective in constructing meaning. In addition, within the zone of proximal development posited by Vygotsky, learning through interaction between learners improves academic achievement, higher-order thinking, deep learning, and reflective learning. LbT also promotes students' learning presence, and strengthens various competencies such as collaboration and communication skills. Interactive behavior between learners in the form of LbT has been explored as an approach to teaching and learning, with methods including peer learning, peer tutoring, peer teaching, peer mentoring, Lernen durch Lehren, and peer-assisted learning. LbT has also been applied as a learning method. In the future, LbT has boundless potential to improve learning through activities such as flipped learning or online learning based on interactions between learners."
Few-Shot Learning을 사용한 호스트 기반 침입 탐지 모델,2021,"['Machine Learning', 'LID-DS', 'Few-Shot Learning', 'Siamese Network', 'HIDS', '기계학습', '퓨샷 러닝', '샴 네트워크', '호스트 기반 침입 탐지 시스템']",,"As the current cyber attacks become more intelligent, the existing Intrusion Detection System is difficult for detecting intelligent attacks that deviate from the existing stored patterns. In an attempt to solve this, a model of a deep learning-based intrusion detection system that analyzes the pattern of intelligent attacks through data learning has emerged. Intrusion detection systems are divided into host-based and network-based depending on the installation location. Unlike network-based intrusion detection systems, host-based intrusion detection systems have the disadvantage of having to observe the inside and outside of the system as a whole. However, it has the advantage of being able to detect intrusions that cannot be detected by a network-based intrusion detection system. Therefore, in this study, we conducted a study on a host-based intrusion detection system. In order to evaluate and improve the performance of the host-based intrusion detection system model, we used the host-based Leipzig Intrusion Detection-Data Set (LID-DS) published in 2018. In the performance evaluation of the model using that data set, in order to confirm the similarity of each data and reconstructed to identify whether it is normal data or abnormal data, 1D vector data is converted to 3D image data. Also, the deep learning model has the drawback of having to re-learn every time a new cyber attack method is seen. In other words, it is not efficient because it takes a long time to learn a large amount of data. To solve this problem, this paper proposes the Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (Siamese-CNN) to use the Few-Shot Learning method that shows excellent performance by learning the little amount of data. Siamese-CNN determines whether the attacks are of the same type by the similarity score of each sample of cyber attacks converted into images. The accuracy was calculated using Few-Shot Learning technique, and the performance of Vanilla Convolutional Neural Network (Vanilla-CNN) and Siamese-CNN was compared to confirm the performance of Siamese-CNN. As a result of measuring Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-Score index, it was confirmed that the recall of the Siamese-CNN model proposed in this study was increased by about 6% from the Vanilla-CNN model."
Attentive Transfer Learning via Self-supervised Learning for Cervical Dysplasia Diagnosis,2021,"['Attention Learning', 'Cervical Dysplasia', 'Patch self-supervised Learning', 'Transfer Learning']",,"Many deep learning approaches have been studied for image classification in computer vision. However, there are not enough data to generate accurate models in medical fields, and many datasets are not annotated. This study presents a new method that can use both unlabeled and labeled data.

First, we use a patch selfsupervised learning for training the global context of the image using an unlabeled image dataset. Second, we generate a classifier model by using the transferred knowledge from self-supervised learning. We also apply attention learning to capture the local features of the image. The combined method provides better performance than state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy and sensitivity."

Multicast Tree Generation using Meta Reinforcement Learning in SDN-based Smart Network Platforms,2021,"['Multicast tree', 'Meta reinforcement learning', 'Multimedia routing', 'SDN', 'Deep learning']",,"Multimedia services on the Internet are continuously increasing. Accordingly, the demand for a technology for efficiently delivering multimedia traffic is also constantly increasing. The multicast technique, that delivers the same content to several destinations, is constantly being developed. This technique delivers a content from a source to all destinations through the multicast tree. The multicast tree with low cost increases the utilization of network resources. However, the finding of the optimal multicast tree that has the minimum link costs is very difficult and its calculation complexity is the same as the complexity of the Steiner tree calculation which is NP-complete. Therefore, we need an effective way to obtain a multicast tree with low cost and less calculation time on SDN-based smart network platforms. In this paper, we propose a new multicast tree generation algorithm which produces a multicast tree using an agent trained by model-based meta reinforcement learning. Experiments verified that the proposed algorithm generated multicast trees in less time compared with existing approximation algorithms. It produced multicast trees with low cost in a dynamic network environment compared with the previous DQN-based algorithm."

A lot of control strategies have been proposed for semi-active control devices. Recently, machine learning begins to be applied to development of vibration control algorithm. In this study, a reinforcement learning among machine learning techniques was employed to develop a semi-active control algorithm for a smart TMD. The smart TMD was composed of magnetorheological damper in this study. For this purpose, an 11-story building structure with a smart TMD was selected to construct a reinforcement learning environment. A time history analysis of the example structure subject to earthquake excitation was conducted in the reinforcement learning procedure. Deep Q-network (DQN) among various reinforcement learning algorithms was used to make a learning agent. The command voltage sent to the MR damper is determined by the action produced by the DQN. Parametric studies on hyper-parameters of DQN were performed by numerical simulations. After appropriate training iteration of the DQN model with proper hyper-parameters, the DQN model for control of seismic responses of the example structure with smart TMD was developed. The developed DQN model can effectively control smart TMD to reduce seismic responses of the example structure."

Efficient Resource Slicing Scheme for Optimizing Federated Learning Communications in Software-Defined IoT Networks,2021,"['Deep Learning', 'Federated Learning', 'Internet of Things', 'Network Functions Virtualization', 'Software-Defined Networking']",,"With the broad adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) in a variety of scenarios and application services, management and orchestration entities require upgrading the traditional architecture and develop intelligent models with ultra-reliable methods. In a heterogeneous network environment, mission-critical IoT applications are significant to consider. With erroneous priorities and high failure rates, catastrophic losses in terms of human lives, great business assets, and privacy leakage will occur in emergent scenarios. In this paper, an efficient resource slicing scheme for optimizing federated learning in software-defined IoT (SDIoT) is proposed. The decentralized support vector regression (SVR) based controllers predict the IoT slices via packet inspection data during peak hour central congestion to achieve a time-sensitive condition. In off-peak hour intervals, a centralized deep neural networks (DNN) model is used within computation-intensive aspects on fine-grained slicing and remodified decentralized controller outputs. With known slice and prioritization, federated learning communications iteratively process through the adjusted resources by virtual network functions forwarding graph (VNFFG) descriptor set up in software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV) enabled architecture. To demonstrate the theoretical approach, Mininet emulator was conducted to evaluate between reference and proposed schemes by capturing the key Quality of Service (QoS) performance metrics."
Residual Learning Based CNN for Gesture Recognition in Robot Interaction,2021,"['Convolutional Neural Network', 'Feature Redundancy', 'Full Connection Layer', 'Gesture Recognition', 'Human-Computer Interaction', 'Residual Learning']",,"The complexity of deep learning models affects the real-time performance of gesture recognition, thereby limiting the application of gesture recognition algorithms in actual scenarios. Hence, a residual learning neural network based on a deep convolutional neural network is proposed. First, small convolution kernels are used to extract the local details of gesture images. Subsequently, a shallow residual structure is built to share weights, thereby avoiding gradient disappearance or gradient explosion as the network layer deepens; consequently, the difficulty of model optimisation is simplified. Additional convolutional neural networks are used to accelerate the refinement of deep abstract features based on the spatial importance of the gesture feature distribution. Finally, a fully connected cascade softmax classifier is used to complete the gesture recognition. Compared with the dense connection multiplexing feature information network, the proposed algorithm is optimised in feature multiplexing to avoid performance fluctuations caused by feature redundancy. Experimental results from the ISOGD gesture dataset and Gesture dataset prove that the proposed algorithm affords a fast convergence speed and high accuracy."
Empirical Analysis of a Fine-Tuned Deep Convolutional Model in Classifying and Detecting Malaria Parasites from Blood Smears,2021,"['Malaria', 'Convolutional Neural Networks', 'Deep Learning', 'Fine-Tuning', 'Transfer Learning']",,"In this work, we empirically evaluated the efficiency of the recent EfficientNetB0 model to identify and diagnose malaria parasite infections in blood smears. The dataset used was collected and classified by relevant experts from the Lister Hill National Centre for Biomedical Communications (LHNCBC). We prepared our samples with minimal image transformations as opposed to others, as we focused more on the feature extraction capability of the EfficientNetB0 baseline model. We applied transfer learning to increase the initial feature sets and reduced the training time to train our model. We then fine-tuned it to work with our proposed layers and re-trained the entire model to learn from our prepared dataset. The highest overall accuracy attained from our evaluated results was 94.70% from fifty epochs and followed by 94.68% within just ten. Additional visualization and analysis using the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) algorithm visualized how effectively our fine-tuned EfficientNetB0 detected infections better than other recent state-of-the-art DCNN models. This study, therefore, concludes that when fine-tuned, the recent EfficientNetB0 will generate highly accurate deep learning solutions for the identification of malaria parasites in blood smears without the need for stringent pre-processing, optimization, or data augmentation of images."

The aim of this study was to compare DNN models with simple clinical score models to predict the risk of ACRN in colorectal cancer screening.Methods: Databases of screening colonoscopy from Kangbuk Samsung Hospital (n=121,794) and Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong (n=3,728) were used to develop DNN-based prediction models. Two DNN models, the Asian-Pacific Colorectal Screening (APCS) model and the Korean Colorectal Screening (KCS) model, were developed and compared with two simple score models using logistic regression methods to predict the risk of ACRN. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of the models were compared in internal and external validation databases.Results: In the internal validation set, the AUCs of DNN model 1 and the APCS score model were 0.713 and 0.662 (p<0.001), respectively, and the AUCs of DNN model 2 and the KCS score model were 0.730 and 0.667 (p< 0.001), respectively. However, in the external validation set, the prediction performances were not significantly different between the two DNN models and the corresponding APCS and KCS score models (both p >0.1).Conclusions: Simple score models for the risk prediction of ACRN are as useful as DNN-based models when input variables are limited. However, further studies on this issue are warranted to predict the risk of ACRN in colorectal cancer screening because DNN-based models are currently under improvement. (Gut Liver 2021;15:85-91)"

For its discussion, the study chose the concept of “moribund,” which facilitated the reconceptualization of curriculums, as a term reflecting the educational phenomenon best and analyzed the study culture of students in the nation based on it. There is no doubt that South Korean students are superior learners and make so remarkable achievements that they draw global attention. The reality is, however, that they spend more time on shadow education than at schools or classrooms. Thirty participants were selected through purposive sampling at six elementary, middle, and high schools. Qualitative research methods were employed to investigate how much South Korean students studied outside the school and what kind of effect it had on the school curriculums and teachers’ lessons.The findings were as follows: first, the importance of textbooks was gradually dropping in the study of students, who achieved a satisfying level in their study by making full use of workbooks and learning materials replacing textbooks; secondly, fewer and fewer students selected classroom lessons. Lessons provided at school were losing their competitive edge due to the large number of students per class, prior learning, and lower status of school teachers; and lastly, teachers’ sense of educational responsibility is diminishing. They began to explore other roles, rather than teaching students to the end, passing the buck of student education to shadow education. These findings shed light on a new area of research called shadow education in the studies on thecurriculums in the nation. The cases of South Korea’s learning culture investigated in the present study is expected to promote the understanding of curriculums and education culture of Korea, drawing a growing academic attention in Northeast Asia and across the world."

Data Correction For Enhancing Classification Accuracy By Unknown Deep Neural Network Classifiers,2021,"['Data correction', 'Deep neural network', 'Ensemble method', 'Machine learning', 'Poisoning attack']",,"Deep neural networks provide excellent performance in pattern recognition, audio classification, and image recognition. It is important that they accurately recognize input data, particularly when they are used in autonomous vehicles or for medical services. In this study, we propose a data correction method for increasing the accuracy of an unknown classifier by modifying the input data without changing the classifier. This method modifies the input data slightly so that the unknown classifier will correctly recognize the input data. It is an ensemble method that has the characteristic of transferability to an unknown classifier by generating corrected data that are correctly recognized by several classifiers that are known in advance. We tested our method using MNIST and CIFAR-10 as experimental data. The experimental results exhibit that the accuracy of the unknown classifier is a 100% correct recognition rate owing to the data correction generated by the proposed method, which minimizes data distortion to maintain the data’s recognizability by humans."
Single Low-Light Ghost-Free Image Enhancement via Deep Retinex Model,2021,"['image enhancement', 'low-light image', 'Retinex model', 'image decomposition', 'super-resolution']",,"Low-light image enhancement is a key technique to overcome the quality degradation of photos taken under scotopic vision illumination conditions. The degradation includes low brightness, low contrast, and outstanding noise, which would seriously affect the vision of the human eye recognition ability and subsequent image processing. In this paper, we propose an approach based on deep learning and Retinex theory to enhance the low-light image, which includes image decomposition, illumination prediction, image reconstruction, and image optimization. The first three parts can reconstruct the enhanced image that suffers from low-resolution. To reduce the noise of the enhanced image and improve the image quality, a super-resolution algorithm based on the Laplacian pyramid network is introduced to optimize the image. The Laplacian pyramid network can improve the resolution of the enhanced image through multiple feature extraction and deconvolution operations. Furthermore, a combination loss function is explored in the network training stage to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Extensive experiments and comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the strength of the proposed method, the result is closer to the real-world scene in lightness, color, and details. Besides, experiments also demonstrate that the proposed method with the single low-light image can achieve the same effect as multi-exposure image fusion algorithm and no ghost is introduced."
Instructional Systems Design to Reflect ETHICS in AI’s Rules of Engagement Learning for Future Warfare,2021,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Military', 'Rules of Engagement', 'Ethics', 'Instructional Systems Design']",,"Purpose: Rules of Engagement(ROE) refer to rules or directives that define the circumstances, conditions, extent, manner, etc. of the application of force or action that can be considered provocative by the armed forces. ROE do not explain how results are achieved, but rather indicate what judgments are unacceptable. Focusing this, the purpose of this study is to propose an Instructional Systems Design(ISD) configured to reflect ethics in AI’s ROE learning for future warfare. Method: This study uses Development Research Method for develop and propose an ISD. ISD refers to the creation of guidelines into smaller units of teaching or learning. If some guidelines are created for such ISD, it would set the composition and application of ROE, and AI will learn that guidelines through deep learning. And the AI makes a decision with this in the hypothetical dilemma situation where the application of the ROE is requested. Finally, human experts review and supplement the learning results of these neural networks. The sophistication of the AI’s learning and applying ROE would be achieved by feeding back this result to the ISD. Results: This study understands that ROE would also be essential for AI or AI-equipped military robot systems. In this process, AI performs the task of making judgments related to applying ROE, which is the principle of action in specific situations. To do this, Ai’s deep learning first collects necessary information and makes decisions based on it. Next, the results of this learning are applied in a new hypothetical dilemma situation. Finally, human experts evaluation and feedback on the results are continuously made. This series of processes can be presented as a model of ISD oriented towards the moral development of AI. Conclusion: AI’s ROE learning converges to the learning of moral values. It focuses on the cognitive aspect of morality. Therefore, it would be possible to refine the cognitive moral judgment of deep learning by applying the learning hierarchy of taxonomy of educational objects and the logical test of validity of moral judgment oriented toward social justice. And the moral development of the neural network can be performed by modifying and complementing the results of human experts and feeding them back."

Blended-Transfer Learning for Compressed-Sensing Cardiac CINE MRI,2021,"['Deep neural network', 'Blended-transfer learning (BTL)', 'Transfer learning (TL)', 'Standalone learning (SL)', 'Compressed sensing', 'Cardiac CINE MRI']",,"Purpose: To overcome the difficulty in building a large data set with a high-quality in medical imaging, a concept of 'blended-transfer learning' (BTL) using a combination of both source data and target data is proposed for the target task. Materials and Methods: Source and target tasks were defined as training of the source and target networks to reconstruct cardiac CINE images from undersampled data, respectively. In transfer learning (TL), the entire neural network (NN) or some parts of the NN after conducting a source task using an open data set was adopted in the target network as the initial network to improve the learning speed and the performance of the target task. Using BTL, an NN effectively learned the target data while preserving knowledge from the source data to the maximum extent possible. The ratio of the source data to the target data was reduced stepwise from 1 in the initial stage to 0 in the final stage. Results: NN that performed BTL showed an improved performance compared to those that performed TL or standalone learning (SL). Generalization of NN was also better achieved. The learning curve was evaluated using normalized mean square error (NMSE) of reconstructed images for both target data and source data. BTL reduced the learning time by 1.25 to 100 times and provided better image quality. Its NMSE was 3% to 8% lower than with SL. Conclusion: The NN that performed the proposed BTL showed the best performance in terms of learning speed and learning curve. It also showed the highest reconstructed-image quality with the lowest NMSE for the test data set. Thus, BTL is an effective way of learning for NNs in the medical-imaging domain where both quality and quantity of data are always limited."
Machine Learning-based Automatic Optical Inspection System with Multimodal Optical Image Fusion Network,2021,"['Deep learning', 'defect detection', 'machine vision', 'optical system.']",,"This paper proposes an automatic cast product surface defect detection system based on deep learning artificial intelligence technology. Application of deep learning is difficult because of the uneven surface and small defects of the cast product which are easily affected by the lighting position and angle. Therefore, three channel fusion data from an optical system that simultaneously acquires a 2D surface image and 3D shape information of the target object were obtained and used for deep learning. The mean average precision (mAP) of the proposed defect detection model using the three-channel fusion data is about 77%. And this result is greater than the 60% mAP of a defect detection model that uses single-channel data. For further optimization, we investigate a deep learning modelthat employs a deep learning network with multiple models, where each model trains and detects only a single type of defect. The experimental results demonstrate that the mAP of the model was improved to 88%."
An Efficient Parallel Machine Learning-based Blockchain Framework,2021,"['Machine learning', 'Blockchain', 'Deep learning']",,"The unlimited possibilities of machine learning have been shown in several successful reports and applications. However, how to make sure that the searched results of a machine learning system are not tampered by anyone and how to prevent the other users in the same network environment from easily getting our private data are two critical research issues when we immerse into powerful machine learning-based systems or applications. This situation is just like other modern information systems that confront security and privacy issues. The development of blockchain provides us an alternative way to address these two issues. That is why some recent studies have attempted to develop machine learning systems with blockchain technologies or to apply machine learning methods to blockchain systems. To show what the combination of blockchain and machine learning is capable of doing, in this paper, we proposed a parallel framework to find out suitable hyperparameters of deep learning in a blockchain environment by using a metaheuristic algorithm. The proposed framework also takes into account the issue of communication cost, by limiting the number of information exchanges between miners and blockchain."
Deep Neural Network Structure Design for Equipment Failure Prediction in Smart Factory,2021,"['Machine Learning', 'Artificial Neural Network', 'Eeep Learning']",,"A smart factory is a system in which all equipment is connected through the Internet of Things (IoT) and all facilities are operated through a virtual physical system. In the factory, failure prediction for facilities maintenance combined with deep learning has recently attracted much attention to researchers. To perform deep learning-based prediction, a neural network model is built and trained using the learning dataset. The training performance varies depending on the structure of the constructed neural network design. In this study, an efficient design of a neural network is explored that is expected to have the best training performance using a dataset of vibration and temperature. To do this, different neural network models are implemented, and their performance was compared by evaluating loss, accuracy, and execution time. In the experiment, the neural network model was configured to have one input layer, two or three hidden layers, and one output layer, and performance metrics values were measured according to the internal node numbers in every hidden layer. Experimental results show that losses do not increase in spite of that node number becomes large. In general, as the structure of a deep neural network model is complex and the number of nodes inside it increases, it is expected that the loss value will be smaller. For accuracy, there was almost no significant difference between all models. In the case of execution time, it took more time as the number of internal nodes of the model increased."
Preparing Students for the Fourth Industrial Revolution through Mathematical Learning: The Constructivist Learning Design,2021,"['constructivist learning design', 'fourth industrial revolution', 'mathematics education', 'transfer', 'twenty-first century competencies']",,"Characterised by increased automation and digitalisation of work processes, the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) has displaced and redesigned many existing jobs, and will create new occupations that are currently non-existent. To prepare a future workforce that is adaptive amid a volatile employment landscape, schools should provide the necessary learning experiences to help students today develop transferrable competencies, which encompass deep conceptual understanding of domain-specific knowledge and 21st century competencies in the cognitive, intrapersonal, and interpersonal domains. In this paper, we study this possibility in the context of mathematics learning and propose a constructivist learning design (CLD) that affords students to engage in deeper learning processes. In the proposed CLD, students first work collaboratively to solve a complex problem targeting a math concept that they have yet to learn, before being engaged in instruction that builds upon their solutions in the teaching of the concept, and practices that reinforce these ideas. Testing CLD in mathematics learning at secondary level via a quasi-experimental design, we found out that (1) CLD facilitates deeper learning as it encouraged students to apply their cognitive, intrapersonal, and interpersonal competencies, and (2) CLD students (n=23) outperformed their Direct Instruction counterparts (n=18) on mathematical conceptual understanding and transfer. Overall, this study suggests that the CLD has the potential to cultivate competencies that allow students to transfer in novel situations, rendering it as a possible learning environment to better prepare students for the 4IR."
DEMO: Deep MR Parametric Mapping with Unsupervised Multi-Tasking Framework,2021,"['Compressed sensing', 'Fast MR imaging', 'Parameter mapping', 'Unsupervised learning']",,"Compressed sensing (CS) has been investigated in magnetic resonance (MR) parametric mapping to reduce scan time. However, the relatively long reconstruction time restricts its widespread applications in the clinic. Recently, deep learningbased methods have shown great potential in accelerating reconstruction time and improving imaging quality in fast MR imaging, although their adaptation to parametric mapping is still in an early stage. In this paper, we proposed a novel deep learningbased framework DEMO for fast and robust MR parametric mapping. Different from current deep learning-based methods, DEMO trains the network in an unsupervised way, which is more practical given that it is difficult to acquire large fully sampled training data of parametric-weighted images. Specifically, a CS-based loss function is used in DEMO to avoid the necessity of using fully sampled k-space data as the label, thus making it an unsupervised learning approach. DEMO reconstructs parametric weighted images and generates a parametric map simultaneously by unrolling an interaction approach in conventional fast MR parametric mapping, which enables multi-tasking learning. Experimental results showed promising performance of the proposed DEMO framework in quantitative MR T1ρ mapping."

Zero-anaphora resolution in Korean based on deep language representation model: BERT,2021,"['attention', 'bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT)', 'deep learning', 'language representation model', 'zero-anaphora resolution (ZAR)']",,"It is necessary to achieve high performance in the task of zero anaphora resolution (ZAR) for completely understanding the texts in Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and various other languages. Deep-learning-based models are being employed for building ZAR systems, owing to the success of deep learning in the recent years. However, the objective of building a high-quality ZAR system is far from being achieved even using these models. To enhance the current ZAR techniques, we fine-tuned a pretrained bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT). Notably, BERT is a general language representation model that enables systems to utilize deep bidirectional contextual information in a natural language text. It extensively exploits the attention mechanism based upon the sequence-transduction model Transformer. In our model, classification is simultaneously performed for all the words in the input word sequence to decide whether each word can be an antecedent. We seek end-to-end learning by disallowing any use of hand-crafted or dependency-parsing features. Experimental results show that compared with other models, our approach can significantly improve the performance of ZAR."

Stabilized Adaptive Sampling Control for Reliable Real-Time Learning-based Surveillance Systems,2021,"['Lyapunov optimization', 'real-time computer vision system', 'reliable system', 'sampling rate optimization', 'surveillance applications']",,"In modern security systems such as CCTV-based surveillance applications, real-time deep-learning based computer vision algorithms are actively utilized for always-on automated execution. The real-time computer vision system for surveillance applications is highly computation-intensive and exhausts computation resources when it performed on the device with a limited amount of resources. Based on the nature of Internet-of-Things networks, the device is connected to main computing platforms with offloading techniques. In addition, the real-time computer vision system such as the CCTV system with image recognition functionality performs better when arrival images are sampled at a higher rate because it minimizes missing video frame feeds. However, performing it at overwhelmingly high rates exposes the system to the risk of a queue overflow that hampers the reliability of the system. In order to deal with this issue, this paper proposes a novel queue aware dynamic sampling rate adaptation algorithm that optimizes the sampling rates to maximize the computer vision performance (i.e., recognition ratio) while avoiding queue overflow under the concept of Lyapunov optimization framework. Through extensive system simulations, the proposed approaches are shown to provide remarkable gains."
Respiratory-correlated 4D digital tomosynthesis with deep convolutional neural networks for image-guided radiation therapy,2021,['4D digital tomosynthesis · Convolutional neural network · Quantitative accuracy · Spatial resolution · Image noise'],,"4D digital tomosynthesis (DTS) techniques for image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) are able to reduce radiation dose, scan and reconstruction time compared to 4D cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). In spite of these benefits, the 4D DTS techniques cause the degradation of image quality due to an intrinsic imaging strategy and consequently reduce treatment accuracy. In this study, a deep learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN) framework was proposed for 4D DTS imaging. The proposed CNN framework consisted of the data restoration network based on a U-Net and the denoising network combined with a 2D wavelet transform, and the network training was implemented with clinical images. The quality of the 4D DTS images obtained from the proposed model was evaluated in terms of quantitative accuracy, spatial resolution and noise property. The results showed that the proposed CNN framework improved the quantitative accuracy of 4D DTS images by 3–19%, and the spatial resolution and noise for the proposed CNN framework were reduced by 2.24–7.33% and 8.92–40.07%, respectively, in comparison to other imaging models. These results represented that the degradation of the 4D DTS image quality can be recovered using the proposed CNN framework, and the proposed model is suitable for maintaining spatial resolution as well as suppressing noise and artifacts. In conclusion, the proposed CNN framework can be potentially used to improve the quality of 4D DTS images for the IGRT."

We implemented a deep learning method based on a three-dimensional (3D) deep convolutional neural (CNN) network, which realizes automatic segmentation and measurement of the entire aorta (EA), true lumen (TL), and false lumen (FL). The accuracy, stability, and measurement time were compared between deep learning and manual methods. The intra- and inter-observer reproducibility of the manual method was also evaluated.Results: The mean dice coefficient scores were 0.958, 0.961, and 0.932 for EA, TL, and FL, respectively. There was a linear relationship between the reference standard and measurement by the manual and deep learning method (r = 0.964 and 0.991, respectively).

For the manual method, the corresponding deviations were -0.166 mm (-1.419 to 1.086 mm), -0.050 mm (-0.970 to 1.070 mm), and -0.085 mm (-1.010 to 0.084 mm). Intra- and inter-observer differences were found in measurements with the manual method, but not with the deep learning method. The measurement time with the deep learning method was markedly shorter than with the manual method (21.7 ± 1.1 vs. 82.5 ± 16.1 minutes, p < 0.001).Conclusion: The performance of efficient segmentation and diameter measurement of TBADs based on the 3D deep CNN was both accurate and stable.

An Approximate DRAM Design with an Adjustable Refresh Scheme for Low-power Deep Neural Networks,2021,"['Deep learning', 'approximate DRAM', 'low power DRAM', 'bit-level refresh', 'fine-grained refresh']",,"A DRAM device requires periodic refresh operations to preserve data integrity, which incurs significant power consumption. Slowing down the refresh rate can reduce the power consumption; however, it may cause a loss of data stored in a DRAM cell, which affects the correctness of computation. This paper proposes a new memory architecture for deep learning applications, which reduces the refresh power consumption while maintaining accuracy. Utilizing the error-tolerant property of deep learning applications, the proposed memory architecture avoids the accuracy drop caused by data loss by flexibly controlling the refresh operation for different bits, depending on their criticality. For data storage in deep learning applications, the approximate DRAM architecture reorganizes the data so that these data are mapped to different DRAM devices according to their bit significance. Critical bits are stored in more frequently refreshed devices while non-critical bits are stored in less frequently refreshed devices. Compared to the conventional DRAM, the proposed approximate DRAM requires only a separation of the chip select signal for each device in a DRAM rank and a minor change in the memory controller. Simulation results show that the refresh power consumption is reduced by 66.5 % with a negligible accuracy drop on state-of-the-art deep neural networks."

An onboard test should be conducted to solve this problem; however, it requires considerable resources and time. Therefore, in this study, a deep feedforward neural network (DFN) is used to predict ship power using deep learning methods that involve data pattern recognition. To use data in the DFN, the input data and a label (output of prediction) should be configured.

Proposal of a methodology for designing engine operating variables using predicted NOx emissions based on deep neural networks,2021,['· Artificial intelligence (AI) · Deep learning (DL) · Deep neural network (DNN) · Diesel engines · NOx prediction model · Prediction in steady-state'],,"The process used by engine manufacturers for the development of a new engine includes the planning and conceptual design phases, followed by the detailed design phase, in which the design target specifications are met. In the conceptual design phase, a rough specification of the target engine is presented to facilitate a detailed design and the additional cost of modification is reduced exponentially. In the conceptual design phase, however, not only is there no real engine. but there are also no 1D and 3D models present, so it is impossible to test and simulate them. Therefore, at this stage, a model that can predict emission and performance only according to the specifications and operating conditions of the engine would be very useful. Previous studies developed an EGR prediction model that can be used in the 0-D NOx prediction using a deep learning method. In this study, a NOx prediction model with high accuracy using only the operating conditions as input variables, without ECU data, was developed using deep neural networks. The developed model has high accuracy with an R-square of 0.988. The feature of this model is that all the input parameters for the deep neural network come from the operating conditions of the engine. Therefore, this model can be used in the early stages of the development of new engines when testing and simulation cannot be performed because they do not exist. The designer can set the range of the operating conditions such that they do not exceed the NOx limits at the specific operating point (specific rpm and BMEP). This variable operating design methodology is expected to be useful in the development of new engines for automobile manufacturers with various engine data."

A novel radioactive particle tracking algorithm based on deep rectifier neural network,2021,"['Radioactive particle tracking', 'Gamma densitometry', 'MCNPX code', 'Deep learning', 'Deep neural networks']",,"Radioactive particle tracking (RPT) is a minimally invasive nuclear technique that tracks a radioactive particle inside a volume of interest by means of a mathematical location algorithm. During the past decades, many algorithms have been developed including ones based on artificial intelligence techniques. In this study, RPT technique is applied in a simulated test section that employs a simplified mixer filled with concrete, six scintillator detectors and a<sup>137</sup>Cs radioactive particle emitting gamma rays of 662 keV. The test section was developed using MCNPX code, which is a mathematical code based on Monte Carlo simulation, and 3516 different radioactive particle positions (x,y,z) were simulated. Novelty of this paper is the use of a location algorithm based on a deep learning model, more specifically a 6-layers deep rectifier neural network (DRNN), in which hyperparameters were defined using a Bayesian optimization method. DRNN is a type of deep feedforward neural network that substitutes the usual sigmoid based activation functions, traditionally used in vanilla Multilayer Perceptron Networks, for rectified activation functions. Results show the great accuracy of the DRNN in a RPT tracking system. Root mean squared error for x, y and coordinates of the radioactive particle is, respectively, 0.03064, 0.02523 and 0.07653."
Similarity based Deep Neural Networks,2021,"['Deep neural networks (DNNs)', 'Kernel method', 'Feature extraction', 'High-dimensional data']",,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently attracted attention in various areas. Their hierarchical architecture is used to model complex nonlinear relationships in high-dimensional data. DNNs generally require large numbers of data to train millions of parameters. However, the training of a DNN with a small number of high-dimensional data can result in an overfitting. To alleviate this problem, we propose a similarity-based DNN that can effectively reduce the dimensionality of the data. The proposed method utilizes a kernel function to calculate pairwise similarities of observations as input, and the nonlinearity based on the similarities is then explored using a DNN. Experiment results show that the proposed method performs effectively regardless of the dataset used, implying that it can be applied as an alternative when learning a small number of high-dimensional data."

Evaluation of the usefulness of deep neural networks in classifying X-ray images according to radiation exposure level for automatic exposure control of digital radiography,2021,['Deep learning · Deep neural network (DNN) · Digital radiography (DR) · Automatic exposure control (AEC) · Image classification'],,"In medicine, X-ray imaging has to have stable image quality while minimizing radiation exposure. In recent digital radiography (DR), the radiation exposure and image quality are controlled by employing automatic exposure control (AEC) technology.In such an environment, the technology needs the capability of accurately classifying the level of radiation exposure despite statistical X-ray fluctuations. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to implement a radiation exposure classifier that could objectively determine the level using the deep neural network (DNN) method. Datasets containing 2000 images were used for training and validation of the DNN. This was done by changing the sensitivity of the AEC of the DR system to S200, S400, S800, and S1000. The changes in sensitivity generated four groups of 500 X-ray images each: overexposure, normal exposure (2), normal exposure (1), and underexposure. The results showed a classification accuracy of 93.83% and a loss 38.9%. In conclusion, through deep learning with X-ray images, an objective radiation exposure classifier was implemented and is expected to be used for the AEC of DR systems and to improve diagnostic accuracy."
Deep particulate matter forecasting model using correntropy-induced loss,2021,['· Air pollution · Deep learning · Particulate matter · Time series forecasting · Heavy-tailed distribution · Correntropy'],,"Forecasting the particulate matter (PM) concentration in South Korea has become urgently necessary owing to its strong negative impact on human life. In most statistical or machine learning methods, independent and identically distributed data, for example, a Gaussian distribution, are assumed; however, time series such as air pollution and weather data do not meet this assumption. In this study, the detrended fluctuation analysis and powerlaw analysis are used in an analysis of the statistical characteristics of air pollution and weather data. Rigorous seasonality adjustment of the air pollution and weather data was performed because of their complex seasonality patterns and the heavy-tailed distribution of data even after deseasonalization. The maximum correntropy criterion for regression (MCCR) loss was applied to multiple models including conventional statistical models and state-of-the-art machine learning models. The results show that the MCCR loss is more appropriate than the conventional mean squared error loss for forecasting extreme values."
Real-time photoplethysmographic heart rate measurement using deep neural network filters,2021,"['deep learning', 'deep neural network filter', 'heart rate', 'photoplethysmography', 'recognition score']",,"Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a noninvasive technique that can be used to conveniently measure heart rate (HR) and thus obtain relevant health-related information. However, developing an automated PPG system is difficult, because its waveforms are susceptible to motion artifacts and between-patient variation, making its interpretation difficult. We use deep neural network (DNN) filters to mimic the cognitive ability of a human expert who can distinguish the features of PPG altered by noise from various sources. Systolic (S), onset (O), and first derivative peaks (W) are recognized by three different DNN filters. In addition, the boundaries of uninformative regions caused by artifacts are identified by two different filters. The algorithm reliably derives the HR and presents recognition scores for the S, O, and W peaks and artifacts with only a 0.7-s delay.

Thus, timely detection of plant diseases is of high importance to practical value, and corresponding measures can be taken at the early stage of plant diseases. Therefore, numerous researchers have made unremitting efforts in plant disease identification. However, this problem was not solved effectively until the development of artificial intelligence and big data technologies, especially the wide application of deep learning models in different fields.

Materials and Methods: Two hundred panoramic radiographs from 100 patients (50 males and 50 females) were randomly selected from a private radiological service database. Initially, 14 linear and angular measurements of the radiographs were made by an expert. Eight ratio indices derived from the original measurements were applied to a statistical algorithm to match radiographs from the same patients, simulating a semi-automated personal identification process. Subsequently, measurements were automatically generated using a deep neural network for image recognition, simulating a fully automated personal identification process. Results: Approximately 85% of the radiographs were correctly matched by the automated personal identification process. In a limited number of cases, the image recognition algorithm identified 2 potential matches for the same individual. No statistically significant differences were found between measurements performed by the expert on panoramic radiographs from the same patients. Conclusion: Personal identification might be performed with the aid of image recognition algorithms and machine learning techniques.

Machine Learning Algorithms for Predicting the Returns of IPO Companies,2021,"['Initial public offering', 'Stock return', 'Forecasting', 'Machine learning', 'Deep learning']",,"Initial public offering (IPO) refers to the recruitment or sale of shares of a company to general investors to list the shares on the stock exchange. Determining the offer price is a type of corporate valuation. It has been consistently highlighted that the offer price does not properly reflect the corporate value in the Korean domestic IPO market. In most studies, the initial yield of IPO shares is around 20% to 30% on average but it is significantly affected by extreme values with high deviations. The wide variation in the yield of individual public offer shares makes it difficult to predict their stock price. Therefore, this study contributes to investors’ investment decisions by introducing machine learning algorithms to predict the closing price and closing price returns over the initial price of the listing. This study analyzes 38 communications and 1,165 IPO cases in the KOSPI and KOSDAQ from July 2004 to May 2021, provided by Korea Exchange. This empirical study shows that Random Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Networks have a higher predictive accuracy than conventional statistical methods."

Few-Shot Image Synthesis using Noise-Based Deep Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets,2021,"['font', 'font styles', 'computer vision', 'image generation', 'generative adversarial networks']",,"In recent years research on automatic font generation with machine learning mainly focus on using transformation-based methods, in comparison, generative model-based methods of font generation have received less attention. Transformation-based methods learn a mapping of the transformations from an existing input to a target. This makes them ambiguous because in some cases a single input reference may correspond to multiple possible outputs. In this work, we focus on font generation using the generative model-based methods which learn the buildup of the characters from noise-to-image. We propose a novel way to train a conditional generative deep neural model so that we can achieve font style control on the generated font images. Our research demonstrates how to generate new font images conditioned on both character class labels and character style labels when using the generative model-based methods. We achieve this by introducing a modified generator network which is given inputs noise, character class, and style, which help us to calculate losses separately for the character class labels and character style labels. We show that adding the character style vector on top of the character class vector separately gives the model rich information about the font and enables us to explicitly specify not only the character class but also the character style that we want the model to generate."

First, choose the interval of the input data. This adjusts the ratio of the stop interval to the gesture interval. Secondly, the corresponding interframe mean value is obtained by measuring and normalizing the similarity of images through interclass 2D cross correlation analysis. This experiment demonstrates that changes in input data affect learning accuracy without structural changes in 3D-CNN. In this paper, we proposed two methods for changing input data.

Massive data are generated from different sensors during wind turbine operation, and SCADA can be used to gather reports about hundreds of possible abnormal conditions. The popular maintenance methods have been mostly designed on the basis of statistical analysis and data mining.However, such schemes need not only big data but also sophisticated processing techniques.This study addresses the aforementioned challenges by proposing a deep learning model with comprehensive data preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning on batch size to achieve abnormal early detection. The necessary data preprocessing is initially conducted besides the conventional data cleaning and normalization steps, and time-series data windowing and label settings are also performed. Then, the imbalanced classes in the records are addressed by adopting an augmentation scheme called the synthetic minority oversampling technique.Principal component analysis is also used to enhance the training. Finally, the proposed deep learning method with fine-tuning is compared with three machine learning models for early anomaly event detection. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can identify potential faults 72 hours before they occur, and the precision rate exceeds 90 %."

In our approach, best coefficients of the linear combinations are searched (trained) with the given input basis filters (IBFs) to reconstruct the convolution filter parameters. Since all the convolution filters can be generated by the linear combinations of the IBFs, the size of a CNN model can be compressed if the number of coefficients for the linear combinations is less than that of filter parameters. Our primary goal is to investigate the possibility of expressing filters with a small set of IBFs by linear combinations. The second goal is to compress a model so that it can be beneficial when the model is distributed and stored (particularly downloaded to mobile devices through Wi-Fi)."
An Analysis on the Properties of Features against Various Distortions in Deep Neural Networks,2021,"['Convolutional neural networks', 'Feature compression', 'Data transmission', 'Image restoration', 'Instance segmentation']",,"Deploying deep neural network model training performs remarkable performance in the fields of Object detection and Instance segmentation. To train these models, features are first extracted from the input image using a backbone network. The extracted features can be reused by various tasks. Research has been actively conducted to serve various tasks by using these learned features. In this process, standardization discussions about encoding, decoding, and transmission methods are proceeding actively. In this scenario, it is necessary to analyze the response characteristics of features against various distortions that may occur in the data transmission or data compression process. In this paper, experiment was conducted to inject various distortions into the feature in the object recognition task. And analyze the mAP (mean Average Precision) metric between the predicted value output from the neural network and the target value as the intensity of various distortions was increased. Experiments have shown that features are more robust to distortion than images. And this points out that using the feature as transmission means can prevent the loss of information against the various distortions during data transmission and compression process."

The sorter consists of a workstation with GPU, camera, belt conveyor, air compressor. A small piece (less than 3.5 cm) of electronic components on the belt conveyor (belt speed: 6 cm/s) was taken and learned as teaching data. The accuracy of the image identification was 96% as kinds and 99% as groups. The optimum condition of sorting was determined by evaluating accuracies of image identification and recovery rates by blowdown when changing the operating condition such as belt speed and blowdown time of compressed air.

The Impact of Collective Art Therapy on the LEARNED Lethargy,2021,"['Art Therapy', 'Learned Lethargy', 'Group Counseling', 'Self-Esteem', 'Success Experiences']",,"Purpose: Since lethargic people express a belief that they are unable to control themselves over some issues and matters, their passivity further elevates, their expectations and motivation for the future fall, and their capaci-ty for performance diminishes. Therefore, it may be viewed that collective art therapy could change negative per-ceptions and behaviors by conducting group interaction and successful experiences in the process of art therapy. This paper seeks to specifically verify the impact on the learned lethargy formed via repeated failures by utilizing the collective art therapy, which is found to be very useful among the various techniques of treatment which might help address internal issues. Method: Uncover the factors of the learned lethargy through references, organizes the concepts, characteristics, and the basic aspects of the factors, and articulate and specify the negative impact on the learned lethargy in detail. Results: The collective art therapy assists one to address issues via deep insights to one’s inner self, encourages one to enhance one’s self-esteem by having a positive self-image, and through interactions by and among the members of group, the process of self-discovery largely contributes to improving one’s self-esteem. It was discov-ered that, by conducting the collective art therapy, group interactions and successful experiences of the art thera-py not only change the negative cognitions and behaviors, but also help achieve a proactive attitude, which is a departure from a depressive behavior studies and a passive attitude. Conclusion: It was discovered that being tamed for the learned lethargy causes a negative impact across vari-ous areas and negative emotions including depression and anxiety. Therefore, through this study, the collective art therapy programs will need to proactively endeavor to ensure that the collective art therapy program delivers a sense of achievement for human growth, convert negative motivations into positive motivations, and that the program is used even more diversely for addressing practical issues."

In downlink NOMA, we consider the co-channel interference that occurs from a base station other than the cell where the user is located, and the user feeds back the signal-to-interference plus noise power ratio (SINR) information instead of channel state information to reduce system feedback overhead. Therefore, the base station controls transmit power using only SINR information.

Thus, rapid estimations of the area of lodged rice are necessary to enable timely responses to damage. To this end, we obtained images related to rice lodging using a drone in Gimje, Buan, and Gunsan, which were converted to 128 × 128 pixels images. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model, a deep learning model based on these images, was used to predict rice lodging, which was classified into two types (lodging and non-lodging), and the images were divided in a 8:2 ratio into a training set and a validation set. The CNN model was layered and trained using three optimizers (Adam, Rmsprop, and SGD). The area of rice lodging was evaluated for the three fields using the obtained data, with the exception of the training set and validation set. The images were combined to give composites images of the entire fields using Metashape, and these images were divided into 128 × 128 pixels. Lodging in the divided images was predicted using the trained CNN model, and the extent of lodging was calculated by multiplying the ratio of the total number of field images by the number of lodging images by the area of the entire field. The results for the training and validation sets showed that accuracy increased with a progression in learning and eventually reached a level greater than 0.919. The results obtained for each of the three fields showed high accuracy with respect to all optimizers, among which, Adam showed the highest accuracy (normalized root mean square error: 2.73%).

For many chemicals, there is a lack of information on toxicity. With the current movement toward reducing animal testing, the use of toxicity big data and deep learning could be a promising tool to screen potential toxicants. Objectives: This study identified potential chemicals related to reproductive and estrogen receptor (ER)- mediated toxicities for 1135 cleaning products and 886 laundry products. Methods: We listed chemicals contained in cleaning and laundry products from a publicly available database. Then, chemicals that potentially exhibited reproductive and ER-mediated toxicities were identified using the European Union Classification, Labeling and Packaging classification and ToxCast database, respectively. For chemicals absent from the ToxCast database, ER activity was predicted using deep learning models. Results: Among the 783 listed chemicals, there were 53 with potential reproductive toxicity and 310 with potential ER-mediated toxicity. Among the 473 chemicals not tested with ToxCast assays, deep learning models indicated that 42 chemicals exhibited ER-mediated toxicity. A total of 13 chemicals were identified as causing reproductive toxicity by reacting with the ER. Conclusions: We demonstrated a screening method to identify potential chemicals related to reproductive and ER-mediated toxicities utilizing chemical toxicity big data and deep learning.

If the prediction results are in a high-risk state, push notification is sent to the healthcare worker's device. Also, blood glucose data is saved in a repository and healthcare workers can retrieve patient's historical blood glucose data. In the future, the neural network used in the deep learning prediction model will be replaced with RNN or LSTM, which is a neural network more suitable for time series data such as blood sugar data."

As a result, the nonlinearity of the hydrological system of rivers or basins is increasing, and there is a limitation in that the lead time is insufficient to predict the water level using the existing physical-based hydrological model.

This type of damage is to appear in the form of cracks, to proceed in the form of spalling. Such concrete damage can act as the main cause of reducing the original design bearing capacity of the structure, and negatively affect the stability of the structure. If such damage continues, it may lead to a safety accident in the future, thus proper repair and reinforcement are required. To this end, an accurate and objective condition inspection of the structure must be performed, and for this inspection, a sensor technology capable of detecting damage area is required. For this reason, we propose a deep learning-based image processing algorithm that can detect spalling. To develop this, 298 spalling images were obtained, of which 253 images were used for training, and the remaining 45 images were used for testing. In addition, an improved loss function and data augmentation technique were applied to improve the detection performance. As a result, the detection performance of concrete spalling showed a mean intersection over union of 80.19%. In conclusion, we developed an algorithm to detect concrete spalling through a deep learning-based image processing technique, with an improved loss function and data augmentation technique. This technology is expected to be utilized for accurate inspection and diagnosis of structures in the future."

That point of view has drastically changed on different levels in just a decade. Nowadays cosmetic formulators should unavoidably meet the needs of consumers who want sensory satisfaction, although they do not have much time for new product development. The selection of new products from candidate products largely depend on the panel of human sensory experts. As new product development cycle time decreases, the formulators wanted to find systematic tools that are required to filter candidate products into a short list. Traditional statistical analysis on most physical property tests for the products including tribology tests and rheology tests, do not give any sound foundation for filtering candidate products. In this paper, we suggest a deep learning-based analysis method to identify hand cream products by raw electric signals from tribological sliding test. We compare the result of the deep learning-based method using raw data as input with the results of several machine learning-based analysis methods using manually extracted features as input. Among them, ResNet that is a deep learning model proved to be the best method to identify hand cream used in the test. According to our search in the scientific reported papers, this is the first attempt for predicting test cosmetic product with only raw time-series friction data without any manual feature extraction. Automatic product identification capability without manually extracted features can be used to narrow down the list of the newly developed candidate products."

However, most of them generate indicators through passive inspections by manpower. This method is pointed out as a problem that the internal state of the structural element cannot be evaluated solely on visual technology, and that only passive photographing and intuition judgment are evaluation elements.

Therefore, automatic detection of the steel surface defects plays a vital role in the steel manufacturing process. For the defect detection, machine learning based classification methods have been widely used such as HAAR feature-based cascade classifiers and support vector machines (SVM). As deep learning methods have been popular, the neural network based surface defect detection has been recently introduced. As for the methods, many researchers, in general, adopt a trained neural network, which is mainly winner in the recent ILSVRC (ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge). Then, the weights and last layers are modified to be used for surface defect detection (SDD), which is called transfer learning. In the previous researches, ResNet152 (winner in ILSVRC 2015) was used and the resulting performances were F1=0.975 and F1=0.912 in two different studies, respectively. However, the neural network used in their research has very wide and deep. Therefore, huge memories to save the trained weights and many multiplier–accumulators (MAC) are necessary, which means expensive hardware systems are essential to predict surface defect on the steel surface. This paper suggests a small neural network dedicated to surface defect detection. The proposed network has only three convolution layers and two fully connected layers.

Therefore, distributed deep learning is proposed to reduce the training time by distributing computation across multiple nodes. In this study, we propose hybrid allreduce strategy that considers the characteristics of each layer and communication and computational overlapping technique for synchronization of distributed deep learning. Since the convolution layer has fewer parameters than the fully-connected layer as well as it is located at the upper, only short overlapping time is allowed. Thus, butterfly allreduce is used to synchronize the convolution layer. On the other hand, fully-connecter layer is synchronized using ring all-reduce. The empirical experiment results on PyTorch with our proposed scheme shows that the proposed method reduced the training time by up to 33% compared to the baseline PyTorch."

Preparation and response to these water disasters requires national-level planning for water resource management. In addition, watershed-level management of water resources requires flow duration curves (FDC) derived from continuous data based on long-term observations. Traditionally, in water resource studies, physical rainfall-runoff models are widely used to generate duration curves. However, a number of recent studies explored the use of data-based deep learning techniques for runoff prediction. Physical models produce hydraulically and hydrologically reliable results. However, these models require a high level of understanding and may also take longer to operate. On the other hand, data-based deep-learning techniques offer the benefit if less input data requirement and shorter operation time. However, the relationship between input and output data is processed in a black box, making it impossible to consider hydraulic and hydrological characteristics. This study chose one from each category. For the physical model, this study calculated long-term data without missing data using parameter calibration of the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a physical model tested for its applicability in Korea and other countries. The data was used as training data for the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) data-based deep learning technique. An anlysis of the time-series data fond that, during the calibration period (2017-18), the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and the determinanation coefficient for fit comparison were high at 0.04 and 0.03, respectively, indicating that the SWAT results are superior to the LSTM results. In addition, the annual time-series data from the models were sorted in the descending order, and the resulting flow duration curves were compared with the duration curves based on the observed flow, and the NSE for the SWAT and the LSTM models were 0.95 and 0.91, respectively, and the determination coefficients were 0.96 and 0.92, respectively. The findings indicate that both models yield good performance. Even though the LSTM requires improved simulation accuracy in the low flow sections, the LSTM appears to be widely applicable to calculating flow duration curves for large basins that require longer time for model development and operation due to vast data input, and non-measured basins with insufficient input data."

To interpret real data with the model trained by synthetic data, the synthetic data used for training should be geologically realistic. In this study, we introduce a method to generate realistic synthetic seismic data. Initially, reflectivity models are generated to include realistic fault structures, and then, a one-way wave equation is applied to efficiently generate seismic stack sections. Next, a migration algorithm is used to remove diffraction artifacts and random noise is added to mimic actual field data.

U-Net is a deep learning-based semantic segmentation method and is mainly used in applications such as autonomous vehicles and medical image analysis. The conventional U-Net occurs loss in feature compression process due to the shallow structure of the encoder. The loss of features causes a lack of context information necessary for classifying objects and has a problem of reducing segmentation accuracy. To improve this, The proposed method efficiently extracted context information through an encoder using residual learning, which is effective in preventing feature loss and gradient vanishing problems in the conventional U-Net. Furthermore, we reduced down-sampling operations in the encoder to reduce the loss of spatial information included in the feature maps.

In particular, the performance of CNN algorithms has reached the level of self-adjusting the source data itself. However, the existing image processing method only deals with the image data itself, and does not sufficiently consider the heterogeneous environment in which the image is generated. Images generated in a heterogeneous environment may have the same information, but their features may be expressed differently depending on the photographing environment. This means that not only the different environmental information of each image but also the same information are represented by different features, which may degrade the performance of the image analysis model. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method to improve the performance of the image color constancy model based on Adversarial Learning that uses image data generated in a heterogeneous environment simultaneously. Specifically, the proposed methodology operates with the interaction of the ‘Domain Discriminator’ that predicts the environment in which the image was taken and the ‘Illumination Estimator’ that predicts the lighting value. As a result of conducting an experiment on 7,022 images taken in heterogeneous environments to evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology, the proposed methodology showed superior performance in terms of Angular Error compared to the existing methods."

It was attempted to provide a more detailed understanding about the possibility of future changes in North Korea by tracking changes in North Korea’s perceptions of South Korea and its perceptions of peace and threats. As a result, the main threat was the US for North Korea’s perspective, and it was also confirmed that South Korea could be perceived as a threat by insulting on the dignity of the supreme leader-Kim Jongeun. The fact whether South Korea’s governments consist of progressive or conservative party doesn’t seem to have significant impacts on North Korea’s perception. Expectations for improvement in inter-Korean relations in 2018 are highly likely to have been perceived by North Korea as an escape from the crisis through the ease of economic sanctions. The reason is that North Korea’s perception about the threat has returned to the same level as before after the severance of US-DPRK dialogue, and it could be revealed by ordering slogans for domestic economic development.

Uploading a video that includes not only yourself but also people around you can cause infringement of portrait rights and privacy issues. In general, The portrait rights of others are protected by manually blurring faces of people moving over time using a video editing program. However, this is a very cumbersome task and the existing automatic mosaic system also has limitations because it does not detect all identifiable faces properly in videos and it misses tracked faces frequently. Therefore, to prevent the problem of infringement of portrait rights, this paper proposes a portrait rights protection system using deep learning. The system uses YOLOv3, Face-Net, and SORT algorithm to protect the portrait rights by blurring faces of other people except the users registered in the system. Compared to the existing automatic mosaic system, It can detect all identifiable faces and blur faces more accurately. It can operate in real-time by skipping a certain frame and performing face verification. It is also possible to flexibly respond to various changes of the face reflected on the camera by applying the SORT object tracking algorithm. The proposed system can improve convenience for users by automating the task of manually blurring faces of people and it shows superior performance compared to the existing automatic mosaic system."

This study aims to forecast the water level of the nearest station to the dam multi-timestep-ahead and evaluate the availability when it makes a decision for a release discharge of dam based on LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) of deep learning. The LSTM model was trained and tested on eight data sets with a 1-hour temporal resolution, including primary data used in the dam operation and downstream water level station data about 13 years (2009~2021). The trained model forecasted the water level time series divided by the six lead times: 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18-hours, and compared and analyzed with the observed data. As a result, the prediction results of the 1-hour ahead exhibited the best performance for all cases with an average accuracy of MAE of 0.01m, RMSE of 0.015 m, and NSE of 0.99, respectively. In addition, as the lead time increases, the predictive performance of the model tends to decrease slightly. The model may similarly estimate and reliably predicts the temporal pattern of the observed water level. Thus, it is judged that the LSTM model could produce predictive data by extracting the characteristics of complex hydrological non-linear data and can be used to determine the amount of release discharge from the dam when simulating the operation of the dam."

Surveillance cameras help detect criminals and people who are acting unusual. However, it is inefficient in that the administrator must monitor all the images transmitted from the camera. It incurs a large cost and is vulnerable to human error. Therefore, in this study, we propose a method to find a person who should be watched carefully only with surveillance camera images. For this purpose, the video data of doubtful behaviors were collected. In addition, after applying a algorithm that generalizes different heights and motions for each person in the input images, we trained through a model combining CNN, bidirectional LSTM, and DNN. As a result, the accuracy of the behavior recognition of suspicious behaviors was improved. Therefore, if deep learning is applied to existing surveillance cameras, it is expected that it will be possible to find the dubious person efficiently."

As a result, 3,758 works (79.4%) were closely related to the two bands. This shows the status of the two bands in the history of Sijo literature. According to deep learning analysis of 299 works by artists from Yeongnam Gadan and 290 works by artists from Honam Gadan, 281 works for the former and 229 works for the latter were highly related to each band. This confirmed the potential for deep learning to be utilized in the Sijo study.On the other hand, although the frequency was not high, the 7th number of Yeongnam Gadan and 35th number of Honam Gadan were the opposite. This reflects differences in the relationship and creative environment of authors not included in the deep learning classification algorithm, which is a meaningful conclusion in that it suggests that external factors as well as internal characteristics of the work should be considered.

In addition, we tried to improve the uncertainty in the model training process by performing learning not only with a single model but also with 10 ensemble models. The trained neural network rainfall prediction model was optimized to generate 10-minute advance prediction data using four consecutive data of the past 30 minutes from the present. The results of deep learning rainfall prediction models are difficult to identify schematically distinct differences, but with ConvLSTM2D U-Net, the magnitude of the prediction error is the smallest and the location of rainfall is relatively accurate. In particular, the ensemble ConvLSTM2D U-Net showed high CSI, low MAE, and a narrow error range, and predicted rainfall more accurately and stable prediction performance than other models.

Thus, the necessity of research on corporate insolvency is being emphasized. As a related research, there is a prediction of corporate bankruptcy, however, a bankrupt company is the company whose business activities have been suspended, and there is a limitation in which it is inappropriate to determine which companies show signs of bankruptcy among continuing companies. Therefore, marginal company, one of the categories of insolvent companies, is selected as the prediction target.

Recently, the machine learning based approach is being actively conducted for improving recognition accuracy. In this approach, a deep neural network is trained using a sound dataset, and then the actual sound is applied to identify the sound category. In the identification stage, the recognition accuracy of the machine learning is degraded due to the ambient noise. In other words, unlike the experimental environment, various sounds are input into the microphone along with the target sound. Since these ambient sounds are not trained, they could lower the classification performance. However, there are only a few research results on the relation between the noise and the recognition performance despite of the practical importance. In this paper, we study the performance degradation of sound classification in the space where the music is playing with considering the music genre and the volume level. For this, we use CNN, UrbanSound8K dataset consisting of 10 kinds of environmental sounds, and GTZAN data set containing 10 kinds of music genres. First, CNN is trained to recognize the sounds of UrbanSound8K, and then five songs for each genre were selected from GTZAN and mixed to the UrbanSound8K so that the signal-to-noise ratio are -20dB, 0dB, 5dB, 10dB, and 20dB. Then we test the accuracy with the mixed sound input and compare with the noise-free target sound. As a result, there is 2.8% to 22% difference in the recognition accuracy by music genre and sound level. The result show that the SNR should be 20dB or more in order for music not to have a significant effect on the recognition accuracy."

Therefore, this paper proposes a 6-step framework for tunnel crack detection deep learning model development. The proposed method is mainly based on negative sample (non-crack object) training and Cascade Mask R-CNN. The proposed framework consists of six steps: searching for cracks in images captured from real tunnels, labeling cracks in pixel level, training a deep learning model, collecting non-crack objects, retraining the deep learning model with the collected non-crack objects, and constructing final training dataset. To implement the proposed framework, Cascade Mask R-CNN, an instance segmentation model, was trained with 1561 general crack images and 206 non-crack images. In order to examine the applicability of the trained model to the real-world tunnel crack detection, field testing is conducted on tunnel spans with a length of about 200m where electric wires and lights are prevalent. In the experimental result, the trained model showed 99% precision and 92% recall, which shows the excellent field applicability of the proposed framework."

English Testing Services (ETS) announced several automatic scoring systems for English writing. In this paper, we suggest using a deep learning based automatic scoring system for an English caption writing test. Our method involves using a sentence similarity measurement, which compares different levels of answer sentences with user writing input. We chose different word embedding types (Word2Vec, Word Mover‘s Distance (WMD), Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)) and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), a linguistic model for comparing semantic differences between two sentences based on semantic representation. Scoring systems should not only satisfy the requirements of complicated scoring rubrics but also meet the conditions of a language proficiency test. Our results show that BERT outperforms three competitive models in predicting accurate scoring levels and also shows the characteristics of the criterion reference which could theoretically express the standards of a language proficiency test."

As the existing accuracy evaluation methods do not take into account images that can potentially be misclassified due to modification of the image, it becomes to trust the evaluation result even if the type of image is accurately classified. In this study, we have proposed a method for evaluating the accuracy of image classification deep learning models considering the potentially misclassified data. We have measured the boundary cost to identify potentially misclassified data for each model and data set and identified potentially misclassified data based on the boundary cost.

Therefore, in order to predict the water consumption, we proposed the methodology linking various techniques that can consider non-linear characteristics of water use and we called it as KWD framework. Say, K-means (K) cluster analysis was performed to classify similar patterns according to usage of each individual consumer; then Wavelet (W) transform was applied to derive main periodic pattern of the usage by removing noise components; also, Deep (D) learning algorithm was used for trying to do learning of non-linear characteristics of water usage. The performance of a proposed framework or model was analyzed by comparing with the ARMA model, which is a linear time series model. As a result, the proposed model showed the correlation of 92% and ARMA model showed about 39%. Therefore, we had known that the performance of the proposed model was better than a linear time series model and KWD framework could be used for other nonlinear time series which has similar pattern with water usage.

딥러닝과 데이터마이닝에 있어서의 데이터베이스권의 범위와 제한에 관한 고찰,2021,"['저작권', '인공지능', '딥러닝', '데이터마이닝', '공정이용', '데이터베이스', 'copyright', 'artificial intelligence', 'deep learning', 'data mining', 'fair use', 'database']","딥러닝과 데이터마이닝이 일정한 분야에서 괄목할 만한 성과를 내면서 인류에게새로운 미래를 가져 올 기술로 각광받고 있다. 그러나 딥러닝과 데이터마이닝을 위해서는 대량의 데이터를 복제하는 과정이 필수적이므로 저작권법과의 충돌을 피하기어렵다. 이에 따라 기술의 발전을 위축시키지 않도록 저작권법 상의 권리를 제한해야 한다는 논의가 활발히 진행되고 있다. 이러한 논의에서 주의할 점은, 기술 발전이라는 정책적 목표는 권리자의 보호와 이용자의 이익 사이의 균형을 전제로 하여야 한다는 것이다. 현재의 균형 상태에 대한 분석과 검증 없이 정책적 목적만을 기준으로 하여서는 균형 잡힌 해석을 도출하기 어렵고, 그때 그때의 사정에 따라 균형의 중심을 옮겨법적 혼란만 가중하게 되기 쉽다. 본고에서 주로 살펴 볼 데이터베이스는 저작물과 달리 창작성을 보호 요건으로 하지 않지만, 그 대신 소재의 배열·구성을 통해 접근·검색 가능성을 제공할 것을 요건으로 한다. 이는 저작권법의 데이터베이스 관련 규정의 해석에 있어 구심점이 되어야 하며, 이를 통하여 문언에 충실하면서도 저작물에 관한 표현-아이디어 이분법의원칙과 일관된 해석론을 도출할 수 있다. 이러한 해석에 의할 때, 저작물의 표현이 아닌 아이디어만을 차용하는 행위가 복제에 해당하지 않는 것과 마찬가지로 데이터베이스의 복제 행위(저작권법 제93조 제1항)는 그 대상이 되는 데이터베이스의 배열·구성을 일부나마 포함하고 있어야 하고, 소재의 체계적·반복적 복제 행위(동조 제2 항 단서)는 원래의 데이터베이스와 최소한 부분적으로 동등한 접근·검색 가능성을제공하여야 비로소 데이터베이스의 통상적인 이용과 충돌하거나 데이터베이스제작자의 이익을 부당하게 침해하는 것이라 평가할 수 있을 것이다. 이러한 해석론에 의하면, 딥러닝 및 데이터마이닝을 위한 데이터의 수집 행위는 애초에 데이터베이스제작자의 권리에 저촉되지 않거나, 공정이용의 법리에 의해 권리 침해를 구성하지 않는경우가 많을 것으로 보인다. 이러한 해석론을 구체화한 권리 제한 규정을 도입함으로써 불확실성을 감소시키는것은 의미 있는 일이다. 실제로 여러 국가에서 이러한 시도가 이루어지고 있으나, 유럽은 관련 유럽위원회 지침 상 회원국이 권리 제한 규정을 둘 수 있는 요건이 경직되어 있다가 최근에서야 완화되었으므로 우리나라의 상황에서 참고할 만한 입법례는아직 보이지 않는다. 일본은 그에 비하여 훨씬 발전된 권리 제한 규정을 두고 있고, 최근 우리나라의 저작권법전부개정법률안(도종환 의원 대표발의, 의안번호 2107440) 도 이에 영향을 받은 것으로 보인다. 그러나 위 법률안은 몇 가지 문제점을 안고 있어개정의 목적을 달성할 수 있는지 의문이 있다. 새로운 권리 제한 규정은 저작물에 대해서는 표현을 중심으로, 데이터베이스권에 대해서는 배열·구성과 이를 통한 접근·검색 가능성을 중심으로 보다 명확한 요건을 두어야 할 것이다","As deep learning and data mining show astonishing achievements in certain areas, they are expected to open a bright future that we never anticipated before. However, they will probably conflict with the Copyright Act as copying of massive data is inevitable to implement these new technologies. There have been voices that the rights under the Copyright Act should be restricted to avoid chilling effects on these new technologies. Such arguments seemingly overlook that the policy of technological advancement should have a firm ground on the balance between the exclusive rights and the interest of the public in using the works. Without careful study and verification of the current balance, driving technological advancement would hardly lead to a well-balanced reading of the statutes. It would more likely bring more confusion by shifting the equilibrium as the need arises. Sui generis database rights, which are the main subject of this paper, do not require creativity as copyrights to works of authorship do. Instead, databases must have an arrangement or structure that enables access and search of individual data. This characteristic of databases must be the core in understanding the statutory provisions to derive a logical and robust interpretation that is faithful to the language and consistent with the idea-expression dichotomy prevailing throughout the Copyright Act. After an analysis based on the proposition above, this paper suggests that a “reproduction of a database” under Article 93(1) of the Copyright Act must include at least a part of the arrangement or structure in the original database, as copying a work of authorship requires copying the expression in the original work. In addition, a “systematic and repetitive reproduction of individual data” should enable access and search that is at least partially equivalent to those provided by the original database to “conflict with the ordinary use of the database” or to “unfairly infringe on the interest to the database” as stipulated in Article 93(2) of the Copyright Act. According to the interpretation suggested above, collecting data for deep learning and data mining in most cases would not be subject to the database rights or exempted under the law of fair use. That said, introducing new statutory provisions that incorporate the discussion in this paper is still relevant as they would reduce ambiguities. The Database Directive (96/9/EC) has been maintaining relatively narrow requirements for restriction of rights until amended by the Digital Single Market Directive (Directive (EU) 2019/790) recently. As a result, we do not yet see any amendments in European countries noteworthy for the legal situation in South Korea. Japanese Copyright Act has more advanced provisions restricting copyrights to allow new technologies such as deep learning and data mining, which apparently influenced the bill for the amendment of the Copyright Act in South Korea. However, the bill does not seem to address the issues properly to achieve the desired outcome. The new provisions should have clearer requirements that are formed around the ‘expression’ for works of authorship and the ‘arrangement or structure’ that enables ‘access and search’ for databases."

From 2013 to 2017 the ninety-nine reservoirs reached a water storage rate of 0%;making a secure stable water supply for agriculture uncertain. There is an increased need for information regarding agricultural water management to respond to the changes in the agricultural environment and climate. Therefore;automatic water level measurement facilities have been introduced to determine the real-time reservoir storage capacity and agricultural water supply. According to the Ministry of Agriculture;Food and Rural Affairs guidelines for the installation and operation of water level measurement instruments;automatic water level facilities are currently installed at 1,734 reservoirs and 1,880 irrigation canals;with water level data generated at 10-minute intervals. The official recognition of hydrological water level data for agricultural reservoirs increased from six in 2016 to forty-nine in 2019. Anomaly detection algorithm methods for data regarding the agricultural reservoir level as well as quality control measures based on agricultural reservoir characteristics are required to minimize data quality degradation and generate reliable hydrological data over time. Though it was practically impossible to analyze the correlation between the water level or run-off and influential factors such as weather and terrain;recently a non-linear hydrological analysis has been possible using models such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). This study aims to present an anomaly detection algorithm for reservoir level data using deep learning based LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models;in combination with other neural networks for managing quantitative information of agricultural water supply."
딥러닝 기반 실시간 도시가스 누출량 예측 모니터링 시스템,2021,"['Deep learning', 'Gas Leakage Prediction', 'Monitoring System']",,"Gas leak accidents can easily lead to fires and explosions, and result in conflagration. A gas leak monitoring system, that can detect gas leaks in advance, is therefore needed. In general, gas leak detection at home depends on a gas sensor. However, the gas sensor only detects the gas leak after it passes a certain threshold, which makes it difficult to take precautionary action. In this study, a system for predicting the amount of gas leaked and monitoring the gas leakage situation through a deep learning model, based on gas data collected in real life, is proposed. To determine the risk level when a gas leakage occurs, the explosion risk level is divided into five stages. The current risk, predicted risk, and absolute leakage amount can be checked through the monitoring platform. It is hoped that this model will help in establishing a gas safety management system for implementation."

딥러닝 기반 Local Climate Zone 분류체계를 이용한 지표면온도와 도시열섬 분석: 수원시와 대구광역시를 대상으로,2021,"['Local Climate Zone', 'Deep Learning', 'Convolutional Neural Network', 'Urban Heat Island', 'Urban Climate']",,"Urbanization increases the amount of impervious surface and artificial heat emission, resulting in urban heat island (UHI) effect. Local climate zones (LCZ) are a classification scheme for urban areas considering urban land cover characteristics and the geometry and structure of buildings, which can be used for analyzing urban heat island effect in detail. This study aimed to examine the UHI effect by urban structure in Suwon and Daegu using the LCZ scheme. First, the LCZ maps were generated using Landsat 8 images and convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning over the two cities. Then, Surface UHI (SUHI), which indicates the land surface temperature (LST) difference between urban and rural areas, was analyzed by LCZ class. The results showed that the overall accuracies of the CNN models for LCZ classification were relatively high 87.9% and 81.7% for Suwon and Daegu, respectively. In general, Daegu had higher LST for all LCZ classes than Suwon. For both cities, LST tended to increase with increasing building density with relatively low building height. For both cities, the intensity of SUHI was very high in summer regardless of LCZ classes and was also relatively high except for a few classes in spring and fall. In winter the SUHI intensity was low, resulting in negative values for many LCZ classes. This implies that UHI is very strong in summer, and some urban areas often are colder than rural areas in winter. The research findings demonstrated the applicability of the LCZ data for SUHI analysis and can provide a basis for establishing timely strategies to respond urban on-going climate change over urban areas."

Semantic Segmentation 기반 딥러닝을 활용한 건축 Building Information Modeling 부재 분류성능 개선 방안,2021,,,"In order to maximize the use of BIM, all data related to individual elements in the model must be correctly assigned, and it is essential to check whether it corresponds to the IFC entity classification. However, as the BIM modeling process is performed by a large number of participants, it is difficult to achieve complete integrity. To solve this problem, studies on semantic integrity verification are being conducted to examine whether elements are correctly classified or IFC mapped in the BIM model by applying an artificial intelligence algorithm to the 2D image of each element. Existing studies had a limitation in that they could not correctly classify some elements even though the geometrical differences in the images were clear. This was found to be due to the fact that the geometrical characteristics were not properly reflected in the learning process because the range of the region to be learned in the image was not clearly defined. In this study, the CRF-RNN-based semantic segmentation was applied to increase the clarity of element region within each image, and then applied to the MVCNN algorithm to improve the classification performance. As a result of applying semantic segmentation in the MVCNN learning process to 889 data composed of a total of 8 BIM element types, the classification accuracy was found to be 0.92, which is improved by 0.06 compared to the conventional MVCNN."

Therefore, drone image-based remote sensing is different from traditional remote sensing in terms of the level of object to be extracted from the image and the amount of data to be processed. In addition, the optimal scale and size of data used for model training is different depending on the characteristics of the applied deep learning model. However, most studies do not consider the size of the object to be found in the image, the spatial resolution of the image that reflects the scale, and in many cases, the data specification used in the model is applied as it is before. In this study, the effect of spatial resolution and image size of drone image on the accuracy and training time of the semantic segmentation deep learning model of six wintering vegetables was quantitatively analyzed through experiments. As a result of the experiment, it was found that the average accuracy of dividing six wintering vegetables increases as the spatial resolution increases, but the increase rate and convergence section are different for each crop, and there is a big difference in accuracy and time depending on the size of the image at the same resolution. In particular, it was found that the optimal resolution and image size were different from each crop.

유·무인 항공영상을 이용한 심층학습 기반 녹피율 산정,2021,"['Green Coverage Ratio', 'Manned Aerial Vehicle', 'Unmanned Aerial Vehicle', 'Deep Learning']",,"The green coverage ratio is the ratio of the land area to green coverage area, and it is used as a practical urban greening index. The green coverage ratio is calculated based on the land cover map, but low spatial resolution and inconsistent production cycle of land cover map make it difficult to calculate the correct green coverage area and analyze the precise green coverage. Therefore, this study proposes a new method to calculate green coverage area using aerial images and deep neural networks. Green coverage ratio can be quickly calculated using manned aerial images acquired by local governments, but precise analysis is difficult because components of image such as acquisition date, resolution, and sensors cannot be selected and modified. This limitation can be supplemented by using an unmanned aerial vehicle that can mount various sensors and acquire high-resolution images due to low-altitude flight. In this study, we proposed a method to calculate green coverage ratio from manned or unmanned aerial images, and experimentally verified the proposed method. Aerial images enable precise analysis by high resolution and relatively constant cycles, and deep learning can automatically detect green coverage area in aerial images. Local governments acquire manned aerial images for various purposes every year and we can utilize them to calculate green coverage ratio quickly. However, acquired manned aerial images may be difficult to accurately analyze because details such as acquisition date, resolution, and sensors cannot be selected. These limitations can be supplemented by using unmanned aerial vehicles that can mount various sensors and acquire high-resolution images due to low-altitude flight. Accordingly, the green coverage ratio was calculated from the two aerial images, and as a result, it could be calculated with high accuracy from all green types. However, the green coverage ratio calculated from manned aerial images had limitations in complex environments. The unmanned aerial images used to compensate for this were able to calculate a high accuracy of green coverage ratio even in complex environments, and more precise green area detection was possible through additional band images. In the future, it is expected that the rust rate can be calculated effectively by using the newly acquired unmanned aerial imagery supplementary to the existing manned aerial imagery."

The extracted features are essential for classifying object categories, and if they are insufficient, it causes a problem of lowering the segmentation accuracy. Therefore, to improve this problem, we proposed the AR-UNet using residual learning and ASPP in the encoder. Residual learning improves feature extraction ability and is effective in preventing feature loss and vanishing gradient problems caused by continuous convolutions. In addition, ASPP enables additional feature extraction without reducing the resolution of the feature map. Experiments verified the effectiveness of the AR-UNet with Cityscapes dataset.

The result of the study shows that quantified street elements have significant relationships with walking satisfaction. First, buildings, automobiles, and signboards have negative associations with walking satisfaction due to the closedness and lack of aesthetic impression. This finding indicates that the walking environment can be improved through the separation of pedestrians from vehicles and the maintenance of complex signboards. Second, street trees (e.g., trees, shrubs, flowers) have positive associations with walking satisfaction.This finding suggests that walking satisfaction can be improved through the implementation of greenery strategies for roadways and buildings. Third, this study finds that visual complexity has an inverted U-shaped relationship with walking satisfaction.In other words, a monotonous street environment or an excessively complex street environment has a negative association with walking satisfaction, suggesting that an appropriate level of visual complexity is important for walking satisfaction."

Thus, identifying the spatial structure of urban green space is required to manage a healthy urban ecosystem. The Ministry of Environment has provided the level 3 land cover map(the highest (1m) spatial resolution map) with a total of 41 classes since 2010. However, specific urban green information such as street trees was identified just as grassland or even not classified them as a vegetated area in the map. Therefore, this study classified detailed urban green information(i.e., tree, shrub, and grass), not included in the existing level 3 land cover map, using two types of high-resolution(<1m) remote sensing data(i.e., airborne LiDAR and RGB ortho imagery) in Suwon, South Korea. U-Net, one of image segmentation deep learning approaches, was adopted to classify detailed urban green space. A total of three classification models(i.e., LRGB10, LRGB5, and RGB5) were proposed depending on the target number of classes and the types of input data. The average overall accuracies for test sites were 83.40% (LRGB10), 89.44%(LRGB5), and 74.76%(RGB5). Among three models, LRGB5, which uses both airborne LiDAR and RGB ortho imagery with 5 target classes(i.e., tree, shrub, grass, building, and the others), resulted in the best performance. The area ratio of total urban green space(based on trees, shrub, and grass information) for the entire Suwon was 45.61%(LRGB10), 43.47%(LRGB5), and 44.22%(RGB5). All models were able to provide additional 13.40% of urban tree information on average when compared to the existing level 3 land cover map. Moreover, these urban green classification results are expected to be utilized in various urban green studies or decision making processes, as it provides detailed information on urban green space."

Until now, the sorting of defective products has been performed visually and manually, so classification errors often occur. Therefore, a camera-based defect classification system without human intervention is required. However, a binarization process is required to separate the required region from the background in the camera input image. In this paper, an adaptive binarization technique that considers the surrounding pixel values is applied to solve the problem that single-threshold binarization is difficult to apply due to factors such as changes in ambient lighting or reflections. In addition, the convex hull technique is also applied to compensate for the missing pixel part. And the learning model to be applied to the separated region applies the residual error-based deep learning neural network model, which is advantageous when the defective characteristic is non-linear. It is suggested that the proposed system through experiments can be applied to the automation of O-ring defect detection."

There are two types of learning strategies: surface learning and deep learning. This study aims to investigate the direct effect of learning strategies on adaptive performance and the effects of positive psychological capital and organizational justice on the relationship between learning strategies and adaptive performance. Questionnaires were given to employees and their bosses at two intervals six months apart. A total of 793 pairs of questionnaires were used for hypothesis testing. The results of the survey are as follows. First, both surface learning and deep learning strategies had direct and positive effects on adaptive performance. Second, surface learning strategies had a negative effect on positive psychological capital, while deep learning strategies had a positive effect on positive psychological capital. Third, positive psychological capital had a positive effect on adaptive performance. Fourth, the mediation effect of positive psychological capital in the relationship between deep learning and adaptive performance was positively significant. Contrary to expectations, positive psychological capital also showed a positive mediation effect in the relationship between surface learning and adaptive performance. Fifth, the results of the moderation effects showed that distributive justice mitigated the negative relationship between surface learning and positive psychological capital, while it strengthened the positive relationship between deep learning and positive psychological capital. Finally, the conditional indirect effects had significant impacts on the relationship between the two types of learning strategies and adaptive performance."

In this study, based on the interviews with teachers and parents of an elementary school located in Gyeonggi-do, data was collected and analyzed on the aspect of elementary school students performing flipped learning in the classroom and at home, parental support patterns in the flipped learning process, parents perceptions of flipped learning, and parental demands for learning improvement. The results showed that the students experienced various difficulties in the process of performing flipped learning, parents support patterns and levels of support for their children s flipped learning differed depending on parenting attitudes and the number of children. The difficulties that parents faced in the process of supporting their children s flipped learning were summarized as difficulties in accessing information, differences in perception between children and parents about the fidelity of learning or tasks, time constraints, and difficulties in families with multiple children. Parents evaluated the flipped learning positively in general but they suggested room for improvement in flipped learning from various aspects. Based on the above results, the last part of the study looked into the parts to consider in the process of planning and implementing flipped learning at school and the topics of academic discussion necessary for the improvement of flipped learning."

Such a complex and deep neural network structure can cause over-fitting problems. In order to avoid over-fitting, a weight decay regularization method of parameters is used.

Such interpretation of the hexagrams of Qian and Kun provides a core foundation for Zhouyi philosophy as the way of self-cultivation of the virtuous man where he learns what Dao(道) and De(德) are from Heaven and Earth and practices what was learned.In Zhouyi philosophy, what the virtuous man should learn and put into practice is to carefully observe and get an insight into the constant changes occurring in Heaven and Earth and notice a harbinger of those changes(機微). The changes of Heaven and Earth do not merely refer to the changes in nature, they also include the changes in all human affairs that realize De by learning and practicing Dao of Heaven and Earth. We, living in the modern era, as well as the virtuous man, should be fearful and cultivate ourselves to spot the moments of change even in difficult times with Zhouyi philosophy in order not to regret or be ashamed of missing those moments. Zhouyi philosophy leads individuals or groups of people within a specific situation and context to explore and make decisions on the basis of one’s life and existence or specific relationships in a reflective way in the process of understanding hexagrams(卦) and lines(爻). We always need to perceive the exact time(時中) and the harbinger of changes(機微) to have a firm and clear understanding of the reality of these temporary and momentary beings and have a deep insight into ‘the circulation of life without a complete extinction(生生)’ which would always remain constant amid those changes. This is the wisdom and the middle path that we should learn from Heaven and Earth.To practice self-cultivation to maintain the state of being moderate[中] where we are not swayed by personal bias or obstinacy, or constantly changing emotions through 64 hexagrams(卦) and 384 lines(爻) of Zhouyi is the key of the book Daxiangzhuan."

Many attempts were made to disentangle the complexity by molecular classification. However, multi-dimensional information from dynamic responses of cancer poses fundamental limitations on biomolecular marker-based conventional approaches. Cell morphology, which reflects the physiological state of the cell, can be used to track the temporal behavior of cancer cells conveniently. Here, we first present a hybrid learning-based platform that extracts cell morphology in a time-dependent manner using a deep convolutional neural network to incorporate multivariate data. Feature selection from more than 200 morphological features is conducted, which filters out less significant variables to enhance interpretation. Our platform then performs unsupervised clustering to unveil dynamic behavior patterns hidden from a high-dimensional dataset. As a result, we visualize morphology state-space by two-dimensional embedding as well as representative morphology clusters and trajectories. This cell morphology profiling strategy by hybrid learning enables simplification of the heterogeneous population of cancer."

We prepared four combinations of alloys, Al-6wt%Si, Al-9wt%Si, Al-12wt%Si and Al-15wt%Si for machine learning. DCGAN is composed of a generator and a discriminator. The discriminator has a typical convolutional neural network (CNN), and the generator has an inverse shaped CNN. The fake images generated using DCGAN were similar to real microstructural images. However, they showed some strange morphology, including dendrites without directionality, and deformed Si crystals. Verification with Inception V3 revealed that the fake images generated using DCGAN were well classified into the target categories. Even the visually imperfect images in the initial training iterations showed high similarity to the target. It seems that the imperfect images had enough microstructural characteristics to satisfy the classification, even though human cannot recognize the images. Cross validation was carried out using real, fake and other test images.When the training dataset had the fake images only, the real and test images showed high similarities to the target categories. When the training dataset contained both the real and fake images, the similarity at the target categories were high enough to meet the right answers. We concluded that the DCGAN developed for microstructural images in this study is highly useful for data augmentation for rare microstructures."

Firms threatened by uncertainties in terms of future survival eagerly pursue and seek organizational learning not only within their organizations but also across organizational boundaries. In this light, implementing the right strategies for organizational learning is considered to be one of effective ways to ensure firms’ competitive advantages and future survival; however, when and how newly-established high-technology firms should adopt and deploy these learning strategies have not been clarified yet. In the present study, the authors attempt to theorize the organizational learning strategies for newly-established high-technology firms by focusing on the process of knowledge flows across organizational boundaries as well as within their own organizations. Specifically, to analyze what types of employees should be allocated or what types of organizations should be chosen for cooperations along organizational development stages, we examine how new high-technology firms implement two different learning strategies, exploration and exploitation, by drawing on resource-based view, human capital theory, and transaction cost economics. Then, considering the current situation that new high-technology firms are actively participating in cooperations with the existing great firms for mutual learning, we extend the existing organizational learning strategies with social network perspective. As a result, we propose an integrated model for organizational learning strategies and provide a representative evidence in the high-technology industry: KAI (Korea Aerospace Industries, Ltd.). Particularly, looking deep in the company history, we believe that our integrated model will verify that new high-technology firms develop competitive advantages by adopting different organizational learning strategies to different types of employees and firms."

Abnormal vessel movement can be defined as an unreasonable movement deviation from the usual trajectory, speed, or other traffic parameters. Detection of the abnormal vessel movement requires the operators not only to pay short-term attention but also to have long-term trajectory trace ability. Recent advances in deep learning have shown the potential of deep learning techniques to discover hidden and more complex relations that often lie in low dimensional latent spaces. In this paper, we propose a deep autoencoder-based clustering model for automatic detection of vessel movement anomaly to assist monitoring operators to take actions on the vessel for more investigation. We first generate gridded trajectory images by mapping the raw vessel trajectories into two dimensional matrix. Based on the gridded image input, we test the proposed model along with the other deep autoencoder-based models for the abnormal trajectory data generated through rotation and speed variation from normal trajectories. We show that the proposed model improves detection accuracy for the generated abnormal trajectories compared to the other models."

In particular, current urban networks, in which the fixed-time traffic signal control system is dominant, can not reflect the real-time traffic situation in the signaling system. Even if the autonomous vehicle is commercialized, it could not exhibit its performance. At this time, if the artificial intelligence traffic signal control system based on accurate real-time vehicle information obtained through V2I technology is developed, more efficient traffic signal control will be possible and it will affect not only traffic flow but also the performance of the V2X technology-equipped vehicles. Especially, when there is unnecessary waiting time for the emergency vehicle in the urban intersection, it may affect the travel time to reach the destination. In case of driving while leaving the lane for the purpose of shortening the travel time, it can threaten the safety of a patient and surrounding vehicles. At this point, if the traffic signal control system that detects the entrance of the emergency vehicle to an intersection through the V2I technology and gives the priority signal to the emergency vehicle is developed, the safer emergency vehicle operation could be guaranteed. In this paper, the change of traffic flow according to the change of traffic signal control system is analyzed based on micro traffic information at single signalized intersection with V2I technology commercialization. A reinforcement learning model that expresses the optimum signal in real-time by learning the traffic information at the single signalized intersection was constructed based on the deep learning through the tensor flow. The performance of the developed traffic signal control system was verified through Vissim. The developed reinforcement learning model expresses a specific signal phase through real-time traffic information and expresses appropriate signal display in the changed network situation. The traffic signal control system developed in this paper is expected to contribute to achieve system optimization in a complex road network and to contribute to the analysis of traffic flow. In addition, it will contribute to building a smart city when autonomous vehicles are operated in the future V2X environment."

However, deep neural networks that depend on training data have the potential to overfit text information instead of learning the speaker information when repeatedly learning from the identical time series. In this paper, to prevent the overfitting, we propose a segment unit shuffling layer that divides and rearranges the input layer or a hidden layer along the time axis, thus mixes the time series information. Since the segment unit shuffling layer can be applied not only to the input layer but also to the hidden layers, it can be used as generalization technique in the hidden layer, which is known to be effective compared to the generalization technique in the input layer, and can be applied simultaneously with data augmentation. In addition, the degree of distortion can be adjusted by adjusting the unit size of the segment. We observe that the performance of text-independent speaker verification is improved compared to the baseline when the proposed segment unit shuffling layer is applied."

After a pilot test done with 678 college students, gathered data were analyzed by item selection and exploratory factor analysis to verify their validity. Next, the main test implemented with 1,541 college students was analyzed with confirmatory factor analysis using the method for rotation based on principle component analysis and varimax for validating the final items to measure ‘deep learning mechanism’. As a result, the ‘deep learning mechanism’ consists of 30 items to measure the following four factors: abstraction of meaning, understanding reality in a different way, acquisition of facts for subsequent use, memorizing and storing. Criterion-related validity were performed at last to check this sub-factor’s theoretical construct. In conclusion, this study concluded that the constructs for deep learning could be generalized and applicable to other samples."

When we decide to buy products online, we read anonymous reviews and buy them. With the advent of the Data-driven era, IT technologys development is spilling out many data from individuals to objects. Companies or individuals have accumulated, processed, and analyzed such a large amount of data that they can now make decisions or execute directly using data that used to depend on experts. Nowadays, the recommender system plays a vital role in determining the users preferences to purchase goods and uses a recommender system to induce clicks on web services (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Youtube). For example, Youtubes recommender system, which is used by 1 billion people worldwide every month, includes videos that users like, like and videos they watched. Recommended system research is deeply linked to practical business. Therefore, many researchers are interested in building better solutions. Recommender systems use the information obtained from their users to generate recommendations because the development of the provided recommender systems requires information on items that are likely to be preferred by the user. We began to trust patterns and rules derived from data rather than empirical intuition through the recommender systems. The capacity and development of data have led machine learning to develop deep learning. However, such recommender systems are not all solutions. Proceeding with the recommender systems, there should be no scarcity in all data and a sufficient amount. Also, it requires detailed information about the individual. The recommender systems work correctly when these conditions operate. The recommender systems become a complex problem for both consumers and sellers when the interaction log is insufficient. Because the sellers perspective needs to make recommendations at a personal level to the consumer and receive appropriate recommendations with reliable data from the consumers perspective.  In this paper, to improve the accuracy problem for appropriate recommendation to consumers, the recommender systems are proposed in combination with context-based deep learning. This research is to combine user-based data to create hybrid Recommender Systems. The hybrid approach developed is not a collaborative type of Recommender Systems, but a collaborative extension that integrates user data with deep learning. Customer review data were used for the data set. Consumers buy products in online shopping malls and then evaluate product reviews. Rating reviews are based on reviews from buyers who have already purchased, giving users confidence before purchasing the product. However, the recommendation system mainly uses scores or ratings rather than reviews to suggest items purchased by many users. In fact, consumer reviews include product opinions and user sentiment that will be spent on evaluation. By incorporating these parts into the study, this paper aims to improve the recommendation system. This study is an algorithm used when individuals have difficulty in selecting an item. Consumer reviews and record patterns made it possible to rely on recommendations appropriately. The algorithm implements a recommendation system through collaborative filtering. This studys predictive accuracy is measured by Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Netflix is strategically using the referral system in its programs through competitions that reduce RMSE every year, making fair use of predictive accuracy. Research on hybrid recommender systems combining the NLP approach for personalization recommender systems, deep learning base, etc. has been increasing.

In addition, five distinct features from road images, including mean, peak-to-peak, standard variation, and mean absolute deviation, were extracted to develop a classifier-based model. From parametric studies, a support vector machine (SVM) was selected. To further demonstrate that the model is more applicable to real-world problems, with a non-integer road grade, a deep-learning model was developed. The algorithm was proposed by modifying the MNIST database, and the model input parameters were determined to achieve higher precision. RESULTS : The results of the proposed algorithms indicated the potential of using computer vision-based models for classifying road surface roughness. When SVM was adopted, near 100% precision was achieved for the training data, and 98% for the test data. Although the model indicated accurate results, the model was classified based on integer IRIs, which is less practical. Alternatively, a deep-learning model, which can be applied to a non-integer road grade, indicated an accuracy of over 85%. CONCLUSIONS : In this study, both the classifier-based, and deep-learning-based models indicated high precision for estimating road surface roughness grades. However, because the proposed algorithm has only been verified against the road model with fixed integers, optimization and verification of the proposed algorithm need to be performed for a real road condition."

The results showed that they were more similar to the song created by a composer when a song was generated with the proper structure of songs."
AI 딥러닝을 이용한 싸움(다툼) 행동 인식 방법,2021,"['Fight recognition', 'AI deep-learning', 'intelligent CCTV', 'feature extraction', 'multi-instance learning']",,"In this study, we developed an AI deep learning-based fighting behavior recognition method for a video surveillance system and proved its effectiveness through various experiments. The proposed method consists of a two-step fighting behavior recognition framework. First, continuous video frames of the target surveillance video are transmitted to the Inflated 3D ConvNet (I3D) network, which shows a good behavior-recognition performance, to extract the spatiotemporal features. These extracted 3D features are then used as the inputs in the next step, where a fight situation is detected using a classification model consisting of a fully connected layer. To use the proposed aggressive behavior detection framework effectively, first, it is necessary to train the fight detection model. However, it is not possible to collect sufficient fighting videos in various outdoor environments. To overcome this limitation, we generated a large amount of learning data through data augmentation. Therefore, instead of directly learning from the training videos transmitted to the I3D network, the classifier trains itself to recognize various fighting actions using the Kinetics video dataset. That is, the action features are extracted from the transmitted consecutive frames using the pretrained I3D network and subsequently used to train the fully connected layer classification model. In addition, we proposed a learning method that includes recognizing ambiguous conflict boundaries using multiple instance learning to mitigate the ambiguous starting and ending of the contention videos. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified through several experiments by drawing comparisons between the present results and those of the previously reported studies."

Currently utilized data in architecture exists in various forms, making it difficult to manage and use the accumulated design information for other reasons. Therefore, this study proposes developing and utilizing technologies that recognize floorplan sketches, one of the analog media, and convert them into digital media, BIM, that computers can understand. (Method) This study is conducted in two parts: 1) floorplan sketch recognition, 2) utilization of recognized floorplan sketches. In the floorplan sketch recognition phase, we propose an approach that applies Generative Adversarial Network-based deep learning techniques to transform human-drawn floorplan sketch styles into one unified form. Specifically, to recognize the floorplan sketches, the deep learning model learns various forms of floorplan sketches and the styles it needs to transform in pairs. The consistent style has essential architectural elements labeled on it : wall, floor, door and window objects. The study uses apartment floorplan images as learning data for floorplan sketch recognition deep-learning model. The apartment floor plan dataset provided by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport Seumteo(e-ais) consists of scanned floorplan images of apartments, houses, and row houses in Seoul. In the phase of the utilization of perceived floorplan sketches, BIM models were generated based on the recognized floorplan sketches. They were subdivided and vectorized by object to extract coordinates, and this enabled BIM models to be obtained by using them as input values for Revit API. (Results) The floorplan sketches labeled with essential architectural elements were the output for the floorplan sketch recognition module, and it was successfully printed out. For the analysis of the study, the predicted image was compared by the ground truth image and showed success. For the second phase, the BIM model prototype made on the Autodesk Revit platform created a fast and accurate 3D BIM model when the recognized floorplan sketches were given input. The created model is low in detail, but it contains the geometry information and the property information, making it an easier way for future use. (Conclusion) This research and development is a sub-development of the overall intelligent design system. It identifies whether computers can recognize one of the design information, floorplan sketches as human beings, and suggests its potentials. Subsequent studies are believed to obtain a BIM model with a high level of detail if recognition is achieved by scaling out of the current recognizable target range."

Among various text analysis fields, text classification is the most widely used technology in academia and industry. Text classification includes binary class classification with one label among two classes, multi-class classification with one label among several classes, and multi-label classification with multiple labels among several classes. In particular, multi-label classification requires a different training method from binary class classification and multi-class classification because of the characteristic of having multiple labels. In addition, since the number of labels to be predicted increases as the number of labels and classes increases, there is a limitation in that performance improvement is difficult due to an increase in prediction difficulty.  To overcome these limitations, (i) compressing the initially given high-dimensional label space into a low-dimensional latent label space, (ii) after performing training to predict the compressed label, (iii) restoring the predicted label to the high-dimensional original label space, research on label embedding is being actively conducted. Typical label embedding techniques include Principal Label Space Transformation (PLST), Multi-Label Classification via Boolean Matrix Decomposition (MLC-BMaD), and Bayesian Multi-Label Compressed Sensing (BML-CS). However, since these techniques consider only the linear relationship between labels or compress the labels by random transformation, it is difficult to understand the non-linear relationship between labels, so there is a limitation in that it is not possible to create a latent label space sufficiently containing the information of the original label. Recently, there have been increasing attempts to improve performance by applying deep learning technology to label embedding. Label embedding using an autoencoder, a deep learning model that is effective for data compression and restoration, is representative. However, the traditional autoencoder-based label embedding has a limitation in that a large amount of information loss occurs when compressing a high-dimensional label space having a myriad of classes into a low-dimensional latent label space.  This can be found in the gradient loss problem that occurs in the backpropagation process of learning. To solve this problem, skip connection was devised, and by adding the input of the layer to the output to prevent gradient loss during backpropagation, efficient learning is possible even when the layer is deep. Skip connection is mainly used for image feature extraction in convolutional neural networks, but studies using skip connection in autoencoder or label embedding process are still lacking.  Therefore, in this study, we propose an autoencoder-based label embedding methodology in which skip connections are added to each of the encoder and decoder to form a low-dimensional latent label space that reflects the information of the high-dimensional label space well. In addition, the proposed methodology was applied to actual paper keywords to derive the high-dimensional keyword label space and the low-dimensional latent label space. Using this, we conducted an experiment to predict the compressed keyword vector existing in the latent label space from the paper abstract and to evaluate the multi-label classification by restoring the predicted keyword vector back to the original label space.  As a result, the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score used as performance indicators showed far superior performance in multi-label classification based on the proposed methodology compared to traditional multi-label classification methods. This can be seen that the low-dimensional latent label space derived through the proposed methodology we"

Recently, commercial FO membrane modules have been developed so that full-scale FO process can be applied to seawater desalination or water reuse. In order to design a real-scale FO plant, the performance prediction of FO membrane modules installed in the plant is essential. Especially, the flux prediction is the most important task because the amount of diluted draw solution and concentrate solution flowing out of FO modules can be expected from the flux. Through a previous study, a theoretical based FO module model to predict flux was developed. However it needs an intensive numerical calculation work and a fitting process to reflect a complex module geometry. The idea of this work is to introduce deep learning to predict flux of FO membrane modules using 116 experimental data set, which include six input variables (flow rate, pressure, and ion concentration of DS and FS) and one output variable (flux). The procedure of optimizing a deep learning model to minimize prediction error and overfitting problem was developed and tested.

We no longer require pairs of a clean image and a noisy image to obtain a restored clean image from the observation. However, it is difficult to recover the target using a deep learning-based denoising model trained by only noisy images if the distribution of the noisy image is far from the distribution of the clean image. To address this limitation, unpaired image denoising approaches have recently been studied that can learn the denoising model from unpaired data of the noisy image and the clean image. ISCL showed comparable performance close to that of supervised learning-based models based on pairs of clean and noisy images. In this study, we propose suitable normalization techniques for each purpose of architectures (e.g., generator, discriminator, and extractor) of ISCL. We demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art unpaired image denoising approaches including ISCL."

This requires a lot of data collection, but the collection of license plates is not easy to collect due to the problem of the Personal Information Protection Act, and labeling work to designate the location of individual license plates is required, but it also requires a lot of time. Therefore, in this paper, to solve this problem, five types of license plates were created using a virtual Korean license plate generation program according to the notice of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. And the generated license plate is synthesized in the license plate part of collectable vehicle images to construct 10,147 learning data to be used in deep learning. The learning data classifies license plates, Korean, and numbers into individual classes and learn using YOLOv5. Since the proposed method recognizes letters and numbers individually, if the font does not change, it can be recognized even if the license plate standard changes or the number of characters increases. As a result of the experiment, an accuracy of 96.82% was obtained, and it can be applied not only to the learned license plate but also to new types of license plates such as new license plates and eco-friendly license plates."

In data design and data construction in the specialized domain area, it was decided that it could inherit the research results of existing dictionary studies. And researcher searched the structure and contents of semantic data, another artificial intelligence data to overcome the limitations of data for deep learning, and decided that the results of existing dictionaries could be fully utilized in ontology design and semantic data construction.Based on this, for practical case study, data for deep learning and semantic data through ontology design were experimentally constructed on the theme of Korean historical character dictionary. First, researcher constructed and experimented with the learning data of object name identification (NER) based on the annals data of the Joseon Dynasty using the object name identification (NER) method of deep learning. The problem that object identification of object name identification (NER) through deep learning only identifies the attribute of the object and does not recognize the uniqueness of the object is confirmed. Therefore, the possibility of semantic data was examined through experimental ontology design to build semantic data as knowledge that has various uniqueness through the relationship with the object’s time, space, and characters. In conclusion, if the concept and understanding of machine-readable data can be added in traditional dictionary studies, it is considered to be competitive enough in both deep learning data and semantic data through ontology."

To solve this problem, we automatically recognized the welding points using a deep learning-based object detection model called YOLOv4.

Since pipe leakages are a threat to the integrity of a structure, it is one of the major monitoring targets. If inspectors are unaware of leakages, access to pipes for inspection can cause serious injury to the human body. Therefore, it is necessary to operate a monitoring system that detects pipe leakage regions for the safety of not only facilities but also inspectors. In this study, a multi-kernel neural network was introduced to visualize the pipe leakage regions through deep learning of the characteristics of pixel- wise color variation in normal and leakage regions from camera footage.

Therefore, access to accurate outbreak prediction models is essential to obtain insights into the likely spread and consequences of infectious diseases. The objective of this study is to predict the future COVID-19 situation of Korea.

Although needles in the meat chunks are easily detectable, they can also be found in trimmings and meat offals, where meat skins, fat chunks, and pieces of meat from different parts get agglomerated. Detection of needles in trimmings and meat offals becomes challenging because of many needle-like patterns that are detected by the X-ray scanner. This problem can be solved by learning the trimmings or meat offals using deep learning. However, it is not easy to collect a large number of learning patterns in trimmings or meat offals.

The Korean Triage Acuity Scale (KTAS) is mandatorily applied at EDs in South Korea.For rapid triage, we studied machine learning-based triage systems composed of a speech recognition model and natural language processing-based classification.Methods: We simulated 762 triage cases that consisted of 18 classes with six types of the main symptom (chest pain, dyspnea, fever, stroke, abdominal pain, and headache) and three levels of KTAS. In addition, we recorded conversations between emergency patients and clinicians during the simulation. We used speech recognition models to transcribe the conversation.Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) were used for KTAS and symptom classification.

For practical human tracking applications, a target must be robustly tracked even in undetected or overcrowded situations. The proposed framework consists of two parts: robust deep learning-based human detection and tracking while recognizing the aforementioned situations. In the former part, target candidates are detected using Detectron2, which is one of the powerful deep learning tools, and their weights are computed and assigned. Subsequently, a candidate with the highest weight is extracted and is utilized to track the target human using a Kalman filter. If the bounding boxes of the extracted candidate and another candidate are overlapped, it is regarded as a crowded situation. In this situation, the center information of the extracted candidate is compensated using the state estimated prior to the crowded situation. When candidates are not detected from Detectron2, it means that the target is completely occluded and the next state of the target is estimated using the Kalman prediction step only. In two experiments, people wearing the same color clothes and having a similar height roam around the given place by overlapping one another. The average error of the proposed framework was measured and compared with one of the conventional approaches. In the error result, the proposed framework showed its robustness in the crowded environments."

For the validation of the CAC_auto system, three previously published CT cohorts (n = 2985) were chosen to represent different clinical scenarios (i.e., 2647 asymptomatic, 220 symptomatic, 118 valve disease) and four CT models. The performance of the CAC_auto system in detecting coronary calcium was determined. The reliability of the system in measuring the Agatston score as compared with CAC_hand was also evaluated per vessel and per patient using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Bland-Altman analysis. The agreement between CAC_auto and CAC_hand based on the cardiovascular risk stratification categories (Agatston score: 0, 1–10, 11–100, 101–400, > 400) was evaluated.Results: In 2985 patients, 6218 coronary calcium lesions were identified using CAC_hand.

Forecasting COVID-19 confirmed cases in South Korea using Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks,2021,"['COVID-19 forecasting', 'Graph neural networks', 'Deep learning']",,"Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a lot of efforts have been made in the field of data science to help combat against this disease. Among them, forecasting the number of cases of infection is a crucial problem to predict the development of the pandemic. Many deep learning-based models can be applied to solve this type of time series problem. In this research, we would like to take a step forward to incorporate spatial data (geography) with time series data to forecast the cases of region-level infection simultaneously. Specifically, we model a single spatio-temporal graph, in which nodes represent the geographic regions, spatial edges represent the distance between each pair of regions, and temporal edges indicate the node features through time. We evaluate this approach in COVID-19 in a Korean dataset, and we show a decrease of approximately 10% in both RMSE and MAE, and a significant boost to the training speed compared to the baseline models. Moreover, the training efficiency allows this approach to be extended for a large-scale spatio-temporal dataset."

However, real-world data contains missing values for various reasons, which degrades the performance of prediction models learned from the poor training data. Therefore, in order to build a high-performance model from real-world datasets, many studies on automatically imputing missing values in initial training data have been actively conducted. Many of conventional machine learning-based imputation techniques for handling missing data involve very time-consuming and cumbersome work because they are applied only to numeric type of columns or create individual predictive models for each columns. Therefore, this paper proposes a new data imputation technique called ‘Denoising Self-Attention Network (DSAN)’, which can be applied to mixed-type dataset containing both numerical and categorical columns. DSAN can learn robust feature expression vectors by combining self-attention and denoising techniques, and can automatically interpolate multiple missing variables in parallel through multi-task learning. To verify the validity of the proposed technique, data imputation experiments has been performed after arbitrarily generating missing values for several mixed-type training data. Then we show the validity of the proposed technique by comparing the performance of the binary classification models trained on imputed data together with the errors between the original and imputed values."

By showing the results obtained from the AI detection system through a visualization platform, it is possible to determine how likely a file to be scanned is malicious, and to help analysts set the need and priority for analysis. Through the pre-trained model, it is possible to derive the detection result without external leakage of the file, and as the AI detection model can be changed and added as needed, the utility of the malware analysis platform is expected to be high."

The method consists of two networks: Crop-to-PanoLDR network and LDR-to-HDR network. The Crop-to-PanoLDR network predicts a low dynamic range (LDR) environment map from a single partially observed normal field of view image, and the LDR-to-HDR network transforms the predicted LDR image into a high dynamic range (HDR) environment map which includes the high intensity light information. The HDR environment map generated through this process is applied when rendering virtual objects in the given image. The direction of the estimated light along with ambient light illuminating the virtual object is examined to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. For this, the results from our method are compared with those from the methods that consider either indoor images or outdoor images only. In addition, the effect of the loss function, which plays the role of classifying images into indoor or outdoor was tested and verified. Finally, a user test was conducted to compare the quality of the environment map created in this study with those created by existing research."

We collected 10,309 PSDs of broadband seismometers and 4,452 PSDs of accelerometers recorded from 2016, 2017 and 2019, and used them as the input of the convolutional neural network (CNN), a class of deep learning. Two deep CNNs for broadband seismometer and accelerometer were trained to automatically determine the condition of seismic data: normal and abnormal conditions. We find that the condition of seismic data determined by the CNNs have an accuracy of 99.9% and they can successfully determine the condition from PSDs of 15-minute waveforms. The outstanding performance of the trained models indicates that this can be a very effective tool for assessing the condition of seismic instrument."

Accordingly, research dealing with various fashion-related problems have been proposed, and superior performances have been achieved. However, the studies for fashion style classification have not reflected the characteristics of the fashion style that one outfit can include multiple styles simultaneously. Therefore, we aim to solve the multi-label classification problem by utilizing the dependencies between the styles. A multi-label recognition model based on a graph convolution network is applied to detect and explore fashion styles dependencies. Furthermore, we accelerate model training and improve the models performance through transfer learning.

Recent research towards integrated deterministic-probabilistic safety assessment in Korea,2021,"['Integrated deterministic-probabilistic safety assessment', 'Residual risk', 'DICE (Dynamic Integrated Consequence Evaluation)', 'DeBATE (Deep learning-Based Accident Trend Estimation)']",,"For a long time, research into integrated deterministic-probabilistic safety assessment has been continuously conducted to point out and overcome the limitations of classical ET (event tree)/FT (fault tree) based PSA (probabilistic safety assessment). The current paper also attempts to assert the reason why a technical transformation from classical PSA is necessary with a re-interpretation of the categories of risk. In this study, residual risk was classified into interpolating- and extrapolating-censored categories, which represent risks that are difficult to identify through an interpolation or extrapolation of representative scenarios due to potential nonlinearity between hardware and human behaviors intertwined in time and space. The authors hypothesize that such risk can be dealt with only if the classical ETs/FTs are freely relocated, entailing large-scale computation associated with physical models. The functional elements that are favorable to find residual risk were inferred from previous studies. The authors then introduce their under-development enabling techniques, namely DICE (Dynamic Integrated Consequence Evaluation) and DeBATE (Deep learning-Based Accident Trend Estimation). This work can be considered as a preliminary initiative to find the bridging points between deterministic and probabilistic assessments on the pillars of big data technology."

Hong Ryang-ho was a Gwan-gak Writer who studied under Jeochon Shim Yook and served as Yanggwandaejehak(兩館大提學), but left many writings through the practical writing of pragmatic statecraft. He pursued wide knowledge, seeking truth from facts, ranging from classical studies to Chinese characters to geography. He put the foundation of learning to classical writing(經術), and divided it into substance(體) and function(用). At the same time, he explained the principle of the nature(性理) as substance and political affairs(政事) as function, and stressed the need for a broad knowledge of history and literature to ensure substance and function to work smoothly.Behind his practical writing lies a unique theory of literature. Researchers have reviewed this in terms of literature, but this paper analyzed it in terms of his theory of ancient scripts. It was because Hong Ryang-ho was not just a prose writer, but a writer who pursued ancient style writing.He defined writing as reason attached to image and manifestation of the Way, and explained writing in a broad sense. He divided sages’ writings into two types: practicing the Way(行道) and propagating the Way(傳道), and advocated writing to express harmony through studies and to fulfill change of things. He declared that fine writing should universal truth, and pursued writing that could bring light to truth publicly in the world through deep learning.He also defined writing as process(經緯) and saw it as fine writing only when the way and the spirit was entangled. He diagnosed the flow of ancient scripts based on the way and the spirit, and found Six Classics as a model where the way and the spirit was entangled. He considered the writings of Qin/Han and Tang/Song Dynasties short of perfection of the way and the spirit. Therefore, he emphasized the cultivation of the spirit, saying that writing is impossible without the spirit as process(緯) despite appreciating the way as rule. He presented Great Spirit as a method of cultivating the spirit.Hong Ryang-ho saw the writings of the Former Qin and the Former Han most solid, based on the Six Classics. He criticized the writers of the Former Qin, the former Han, and Tang and Soong Dynasties based onacademic standards, giving Ga-ui the highest rating over Sima Qian. Hong Ryang-ho believed that Ga-ui had advocated ancient scripts of West Han, compiled the book 『Gaja Su-eon』 and followed his writing. He regarded Ga-ui as the only scholar who had both talent and scholarship, also with both substance and function, and evaluated him as the best writer in the Seo Han Period.Hong Ryang-ho's theory of ancient scripts is characterized by a compromise between the literary theory of moral scholars and the theory of ancient script scholars of Qin and Han. This is a new theory of the practical writing of pragmatic statecraft, with the model of ancient scripts in Six Classics, away from the two main trends of ancient script scholars of Qin and Han, and Tang and Song."
Abnormal state diagnosis model tolerant to noise in plant data,2021,"['Accident diagnosis', 'Nuclear power plant', 'Abnormal operating procedure', 'neural network']",,"When abnormal events occur in a nuclear power plant, operators must conduct appropriate abnormal operating procedures. It is burdensome though for operators to choose the appropriate procedure considering the numerous main plant parameters and hundreds of alarms that should be judged in a short time. Recently, various research has applied deep-learning algorithms to support this problem by classifying each abnormal condition with high accuracy. Most of these models are trained with simulator data because of a lack of plant data for abnormal states, and as such, developed models may not have tolerance for plant data in actual situations. In this study, two approaches are investigated for a deep-learning model trained with simulator data to overcome the performance degradation caused by noise in actual plant data. First, a preprocessing method using several filters was employed to smooth the test data noise, and second, a data augmentation method was applied to increase the acceptability of the untrained data. Results of this study confirm that the combination of these two approaches can enable high model performance even in the presence of noisy data as in real plants."

The study’s goal is to identify rules for automated visual image detection of body objectification and sexualization. To do so, previous qualitative study findings were used to identify target images and the cutting-edge object-detection deep learning algorithm, YOLO4 (You Only Look Once), and MediaPipe, a framework for deep learning-based pose detection, were used to search for patterns. As this is a one-of-a-kind study linking body objectification and algorithm-based object detection, the case for analysis must be carefully chosen, taking into account random effects from unplanned camera movements caused by real-time broadcasting. The dance to the song ’Rollin’ by the female group ’Brave Girls’ had already been broadcasted earlier in 2017. Thus, the on-stage choreography and camera movements associated with the song were already known, making them suitable for research data. The study used music programs that aired on three broadcasting networks, KBS, MBC, and SBS, during the second week of March, 2021. To fine-tune the patterns, 12 screen images were selected by extracting keyframes from the song’s original music videos. The study’s findings are summarized below. To begin, when the scene transition is associated with a significant decrease in the number of people in the visual frame in comparison to the previous frame, it is frequently associated with female body objectification. Because body objection is associated with an emphasis on a specific body-part in the absence of a face, this is essentially a zoom-in technique transited from a wide-angle view of the scene. This rule, however, is insufficient for detecting objectified visual images; it can also be applied to screen images that avoid sexualized images in the given dance choreography. As a result, an additional rule is required to exclusively find images of female body objectification, and it is discovered that detecting human faces on the screen appears to be a good measure. In other words, unless the human faces on the screen do not appear with the scene transition that shows a dramatic decrease in the number of humans in the scene, a visual flow of images can be considered female body objectification. The study also compared the levels of objectification across broadcasting networks and found that MBC has a lower proportion of sexualized images than that of other networks. On MBC’s music program, the MediaPipe framework for pose detection discovered fewer scene images with lower body parts than others. The findings of this study suggest that computer vision research can be used to detect female objectified bodies and sexual images in television programs."

CNN 모델을 이용한 프로그램 코드 변경 예측,2021,,,"A software system is required to change during its life cycle due to various requirements such as adding functionalities, fixing bugs, and adjusting to new computing environments. Such program code modification should be considered as carefully as a new system development becase unexpected software errors could be introduced. In addition, when reusing open source programs, we can expect higher quality software if code changes of the open source program are predicted in advance. This paper proposes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based deep learning model to predict source code changes. In this paper, the prediction of code changes is considered as a kind of a binary classification problem in deep learning and labeled datasets are used for supervised learning. Java projects and code change logs are collected from GitHub for training and testing datasets. Software metrics are computed from the collected Java source code and they are used as input data for the proposed model to detect code changes. The performance of the proposed model has been measured by using evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. The experimental results show the proposed CNN model has achieved 95% in terms of F1-Score and outperformed the multilayer percept-based DNN model whose F1-Score is 92%."

To perform a tidy-up task using a robot, it is necessary to estimate the pose of various objects and to classify the objects. Pose estimation requires the CAD model of an object, but these models of most objects in daily life are not available. Therefore, this study proposes an algorithm that uses point cloud and PCA to estimate the pose of objects without the help of CAD models in cluttered environments. In addition, objects are usually detected using a deep learning-based object detection. However, this method has a limitation in that only the learned objects can be recognized, and it may take a long time to learn. This study proposes an image matching based on few-shot learning and Siamese network. It was shown from experiments that the proposed method can be effectively applied to the robotic tidy-up system, which showed a success rate of 85% in the tidy-up task."

However, many deep learning-based studies are still focused on classifying the types of cracks. The classification of crack types is highly anticipated in that it can improve the crack detection process, which is currently relying on manual intervention. However, it is essential to calculate the severity of the cracks as well as identifying the type of cracks in actual pavement maintenance planning, but studies related to road crack detection have not progressed enough to automated calculation of the severity of cracks. In order to calculate the severity of the crack, the type of crack and the area of the crack in the image must be identified together. This study deals with a method of using Mobilenet-SSD that is deep learning-based object detection techniques to effectively automate the simultaneous detection of crack types and crack areas. To improve the accuracy of object-detection for road cracks, several experiments were conducted to combine the U-Net for automatic segmentation of input image and object-detection model, and the results were summarized. As a result, image masking with U-Net is able to maximize object-detection performance with 0.9315 mAP value.

Generating 3D texture models of vessel pipes using 2D texture transferred by object recognition,2021,"['augmented reality', 'CycleGAN', 'ResNet', 'normalization', 'texture', '3D model']",,"Research and development of smart vessels has progressed significantly in recent years, and ships have become high-value technology-intensive resources. These ships entail high production costs and long-life cycles. Thus, modernized technical design, professional training, and aggressive maintenance are important factors in the efficient management of ships. With the continuing digital revolution, the industrial shipbuilding applicability of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies as well as related 3D system modeling and processes has increased. However, resolving the differences between AR/VR and real-world models remains burdensome. This problem is particularly evident when mapping various texture characteristics to virtual objects. To mitigate the burden and improve the performance of such technologies, it is necessary to directly define various texture characteristics or to express them using expensive equipment. The use of deep-learning-based CycleGAN, however, has gained attention as a method of learning and automatically mapping real-object textures. Thus, we seek to use CycleGAN to improve the immersive capacities of AR/VR models and to reduce production costs for shipbuilding. However, when applying CycleGAN’s textures to pipe structures, the performance is insufficient for direct application to industrial piping networks. Therefore, this study investigates an improved CycleGAN algorithm that can be specifically applied to the shipbuilding industry by combining a modified object-recognition algorithm with a double normalization method. Thus, we demonstrate that basic knowledge on the production of AR industrial pipe models can be applied to virtual models through machine learning to deliver low-cost and high-quality textures. Our results provide an on-ramp for future CycleGAN studies related to the shipbuilding industry."

If a fish disease is not detected at an early stage in the farm, the disease spreads quickly because the farm is a closed environment. Therefore, early detection of diseases is crucial to prevent mass mortality of fish raised in farms. Recently deep learning-based automatic identification of fish diseases has been widely used, but there are many difficulties in identifying objects due to insufficient images of fish diseases. Therefore, this paper suggests a method to generate a large number of fish disease images by synthesizing normal images and disease images using SinGAN deep learning model in order to to solve the lack of fish disease images. We generate images from the three most frequently occurring Paralichthys Olivaceus diseases such as Scuticociliatida, Vibriosis, and Lymphocytosis and compare them with the original image. In this study, a total of 330 sheets of scutica disease, 110 sheets of vibrioemia, and 110 sheets of limphosis were made by synthesizing 10 disease patterns with 11 normal halibut images, and 1,320 images were produced by quadrupling the images."

ConvLSTM을 이용한 도로 구간 속도 예측 기법,2021,"['speed prediction', 'deep neural network', 'CNN', 'LSTM']",,"Predicting the speed of a road link, which means a specific segment of a road, is an important technology for location-based services like best route on the road. Recently, machine learning-based speed prediction methods including deep neural networks have been proposed.

CNN can predict the speed by considering the spatial characteristics of the road, and RNN can predict the speed by considering the temporal characteristics of the speed change according to time of the road. In this paper, we propose a speed prediction method based on Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) combining RNN and CNN that considers the properties of the neighboring links of the road link and the properties of the temporal road link together. In addition, the previously proposed LSTM-based speed prediction method is partially modified and implemented, and the performance of both is compared through experiments.

The analyses revealed that the social studies 1 textbook consistently displayed a higher linguistic complexity than the social studies 2 for all the measures which produced significant differences between the textbooks, except for pronoun measures. The current findings indicate that the linguistic connectivity between school social studies textbooks is not properly established; this suggests the possibility that learning efficiency through textbooks can be reduced.

A total of 27 crossbred sows (Yorkshire × Landrace; average body weight, 192.2 ± 4.8 kg) were assigned to three treatments in a randomized complete block design during the last stage of gestation (days 90 to 114). The sows in group 1 were fed a 3% fiber diet under neutral ambient temperature; the sows in group 2 were fed a diet with 3% fiber under high ambient temperature (HT); the sows in group 3 were fed a 6% fiber diet under HT. Eight popular deep learning-based feature extraction frameworks (DenseNet121, DenseNet201, InceptionResNetV2, InceptionV3, MobileNet, VGG16, VGG19, and Xception) used for automatic swine posture classification were selected and compared using the swine posture image dataset that was constructed under real swine farm conditions. The neural network models showed excellent performance on previously unseen data (ability to generalize). The DenseNet121 feature extractor achieved the best performance with 99.83% accuracy, and both DenseNet201 and MobileNet showed an accuracy of 99.77% for the classification of the image dataset. The behavior of sows classified by the DenseNet121 feature extractor showed that the HT in our study reduced (p < 0.05) the standing behavior of sows and also has a tendency to increase (p = 0.082) lying behavior. High dietary fiber treatment tended to increase (p = 0.064) lying and decrease (p < 0.05) the standing behavior of sows, but there was no change in sitting under HT conditions."

As a result, various attempts have been made to automatically summarize a large amount of text. In particular, the abstractive summarization approach is being actively studied because it can create a new summary with rich contextual expressions. In the abstractive summarization task, neural network-based transformer models show high-performance and are used widely. However, if a sufficient amount of training data is not provided, it is difficult to generate a high-quality summary because the parameters constituting the transformer are not sufficiently learned. In this work, we proposes a text summarization method that generates a high-quality summary given a small amount of training data. Specifically, we extract some elements of KoBERT and apply them to a transformer-based abstractive summarization model. We conducted an experiment on 42,803 cases of Dacon's summary data to evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology. As a result of the experiment, it was confirmed that the proposed methodology showed superior performance based on the ROUGE index compared to the comparative method."

Many retrospective studies conducted with real-time application of AI using convolutional neural networks have shown improved colorectal polyp detection. Moreover, a recent randomized clinical trial reported additional polyp detection with shorter analysis time. Studies conducted regarding polyp characterization provided additional promising results. Application of AI with narrow band imaging in real-time prediction of the pathology of diminutive polyps resulted in high diagnostic accuracy. In addition, application of AI with endocytoscopy or confocal laser endomicroscopy was investigated for realtime cellular diagnosis, and the diagnostic accuracy of some studies was comparable to that of pathologists. With AI technology, we can expect a higher polyp detection rate with reduced time and cost by avoiding unnecessary procedures, resulting in enhanced colonoscopy efficiency. However, for AI application in actual daily clinical practice, more prospective studies with minimized selection bias, consensus on standardized utilization, and regulatory approval are needed.

Fault Diagnosis of Bearing Based on Convolutional Neural Network Using Multi-Domain Features,2021,"['CNN', 'DWT', 'Fault Diagnosis', 'Multi-domain', 'Time series Classification']",,"Failures frequently occurred in manufacturing machines due to complex and changeable manufacturing environments, increasing the downtime and maintenance costs. This manuscript develops a novel deep learning-based method named Multi-Domain Convolutional Neural Network (MDCNN) to deal with this challenging task with vibration signals. The proposed MDCNN consists of time-domain, frequency-domain, and statistical-domain feature channels. The Time-domain channel is to model the hidden patterns of signals in the time domain. The frequency-domain channel uses Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) to obtain the rich feature representations of signals in the frequency domain. The statistic-domain channel contains six statistical variables, which is to reflect the signals’ macro statistical-domain features, respectively. Firstly, in the proposed MDCNN, time-domain and frequency-domain channels are processed by CNN individually with various filters. Secondly, the CNN extracted features from time, and frequency domains are merged as time-frequency features. Lastly, time-frequency domain features are fused with six statistical variables as the comprehensive features for identifying the fault. Thereby, the proposed method could make full use of those three domain-features for fault diagnosis while keeping high distinguishability due to CNN's utilization. The authors designed massive experiments with 10-folder cross-validation technology to validate the proposed method's effectiveness on the CWRU bearing data set. The experimental results are calculated by ten-time averaged accuracy. They have confirmed that the proposed MDCNN could intelligently, accurately, and timely detect the fault under the complex manufacturing environments, whose accuracy is nearly 100%."

CNN Based Face Tracking and Re-identification for Privacy Protection in Video Contents,2021,,,"Recently there is sharply increasing interest in watching and creating video contents such as YouTube. However, creating such video contents without privacy protection technique can expose other people in the background in public, which is consequently violating their privacy rights. This paper seeks to remedy these problems and proposes a technique that identifies faces and protecting portrait rights by blurring the face. The key contribution of this paper lies on our deep-learning technique with low detection error and high computation that allow to protect portrait rights in real-time videos. To reduce errors, an efficient tracking algorithm was used in this system with face detection and face recognition algorithm. This paper compares the performance of the proposed system with and without the tracking algorithm. We believe this system can be used wherever the video is used."

Self-Supervised Long-Short Term Memory Network for Solving Complex Job Shop Scheduling Problem,2021,"['Job Shop Scheduling Problem', 'JSSP', 'LSTM', 'Smart Factory', 'ICONI 2020']",,"The job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) plays a critical role in smart manufacturing, an effective JSSP scheduler could save time cost and increase productivity. Conventional methods are very time-consumption and cannot deal with complicated JSSP instances as it uses one optimal algorithm to solve JSSP. This paper proposes an effective scheduler based on deep learning technology named self-supervised long-short term memory (SS-LSTM) to handle complex JSSP accurately. First, using the optimal method to generate sufficient training samples in small-scale JSSP. SS-LSTM is then applied to extract rich feature representations from generated training samples and decide the next action. In the proposed SS-LSTM, two channels are employed to reflect the full production statues. Specifically, the detailed-level channel records 18 detailed product information while the system-level channel reflects the type of whole system states identified by the k-means algorithm. Moreover, adopting a self-supervised mechanism with LSTM autoencoder to keep high feature extraction capacity simultaneously ensuring the reliable feature representative ability. The authors implemented, trained, and compared the proposed method with the other leading learning-based methods on some complicated JSSP instances. The experimental results have confirmed the effectiveness and priority of the proposed method for solving complex JSSP instances in terms of make-span."
합성곱 신경망의 Channel Attention 모듈 및 제한적인 각도 다양성 조건에서의 SAR 표적영상 식별로의 적용,2021,,,"In the field of automatic target recognition(ATR) with synthetic aperture radar(SAR) imagery, it is usually impractical to obtain SAR target images covering a full range of aspect views. When the database consists of SAR target images with limited angular diversity, it can lead to performance degradation of the SAR-ATR system. To address this problem, this paper proposes a deep learning-based method where channel attention modules(CAMs) are inserted to a convolutional neural network(CNN). Motivated by the idea of the squeeze-and-excitation(SE) network, the CAM is considered to help improve recognition performance by selectively emphasizing discriminative features and suppressing ones with less information. After testing various CAM types included in the ResNet18-type base network, the SE CAM and its modified forms are applied to SAR target recognition using MSTAR dataset with different reduction ratios in order to validate recognition performance improvement under the limited angular diversity condition."

The name of Eliza was derived from Bernard Shaws drama so called Pygmalion . In fact, Eliza is the main woman character and Professor Higgins teaches her systematically accurate pronunciation and speech in the drama so she is able to acquire upper class lady s language.It is interesting that the first chatbot s name is Eliza. Eliza in the drama shows that learning some language skills suddenly makes someone become a very linguistically talented and new person. Likewise a chatbot becomes linguistically skillful and a useful conversation counterpart through Data Base(DB) and Deep Learning.In this context, from the standpoint of linguistic anthropology, I will investigate some similar elements of artificial intelligence based chatbots and language acquisition inside Bernard Shaws drama Pygmalion . In particular, two main viewpoints such as language and gender as well as terms of address and social identity are employed for analysis. Firstly, Higgins s language classes for Eliza have crucial weak points in so far that they can not provide proper women s language.For example, womens usage of slang or swearing in English society are normally restricted by their mother and even their neighbours, but that is not the case for Eliza in the drama. Secondly, terms of address usually present social status and identity concerning speakers comparing to addressee. In the drama Higgins calls Eliza with her first name while Colonel Pickering addresses her with her last name, Miss Doolittle. Likewise it could be of importance to choose wisely how we address and treat a chatbot."

It includes lane detection, lane tracking and control. It has been developed enormously, but it is still a challenge work due to diff erent factors such as illumination, general hyper-parameters setting for diff erent road condition and lane boundary correction. In addition, due to imbalance on accuracy and processing time, it is hard to conduct in embedding system. In this study, an autonomous lane keeping system is developed based on deep learning.

Micro-Expression Recognition Base on Optical Flow Features and Improved MobileNetV2,2021,"['Micro-expression', 'MobileNetV2', 'optical flow', 'SVM']",,"When a person tries to conceal emotions, real emotions will manifest themselves in the form of micro-expressions. Research on facial micro-expression recognition is still extremely challenging in the field of pattern recognition. This is because it is difficult to implement the best feature extraction method to cope with micro-expressions with small changes and short duration. Most methods are based on hand-crafted features to extract subtle facial movements. In this study, we introduce a method that incorporates optical flow and deep learning. First, we take out the onset frame and the apex frame from each video sequence. Then, the motion features between these two frames are extracted using the optical flow method. Finally, the features are inputted into an improved MobileNetV2 model, where SVM is applied to classify expressions. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the method, we conduct experiments on the public spontaneous micro-expression database CASME II.

Courtly Discussions on The Book of Ode was answered by 18 servants to King Jeong-jo's question about The Book of Ode, which is a vast amount of data with as many as 595 questions and answers. However, only one person's answer was recorded in one question, making it difficult to investigate the rest of the people's answers, but Kim Heesoon's Sanmokheonjip, Choi Byeok's Jillamjip and Jeong Yagyong's Yeoyudang jeonseo, separately included their answers, so this paper used them as the main data. It is thought that the work of tracing the deep consideration and thinking about the answer of King Jeong-jo and his servants on The Book of Ode in the literature-related questions and answers will help juniors learn The Book of Ode and explore the academic culture of the time.In this paper, we compared the contents of Courtly Discussions on The Book of Ode and the collection of these characters, and found the following peculiarities. First, It emphasized graphonomy. Sulmunhaeja is the most frequently used main annotation in The Book of Ode. Of the 30 clauses asked by King Jeong-jo in Junam, 13 are deeply related to graphonomy, and 13 clauses in the case of Sonam. The second is King Jeong-jo's erudition. A vast volume of Gyeongsagangui which King Jeongjo inquired about the scriptures with his servants, and 595 clauses of Courtly Discussions on The Book of Ode, including Jipjeon, Yegi, Euirea, Zhuziyulei, Zhuyuk, Daehak, Yia, Zhurea, Gajasinseo, are enough to gauge King Jeong-jo's interest in learning. Third, Jeong Yakgyong's broad answer. Of the 18 subjects, he left the most answers to Yeoyudang jeonseo, which he wrote in detail, citing numerous authentic precedents compared to other persons.In addition, some of the following questions were captured. These are the errors between Courtly Discussions on The Book of Ode and the contents of other servant’s literary works and the criteria by which the answers are included in the Courtly Discussions on The Book of Ode. There are many cases in which what is included in Courtly Discussions on The Book of Ode is not in the collection of other servant’s literary works who exchanged questions and answers, and vice versa. In some cases, the contents of the answer are different even if it is included on both sides.

Text-to-image is what allows computers to do this associative process. The previous deep learning-based text-to-image model extracts text features using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and bi-directional LSTM, and generates an image by inputting it to the GAN. The previous text-to-image model uses basic embedding in text feature extraction, and it takes a long time to train because images are generated using several modules. Therefore, in this research, we propose a method of extracting features by using the attention mechanism, which has improved performance in the natural language processing field, for sentence embedding, and generating an image by inputting the extracted features into the GAN. As a result of the experiment, the inception score was higher than that of the model used in the previous study, and when judged with the naked eye, an image that expresses the features well in the input sentence was created. In addition, even when a long sentence is input, an image that expresses the sentence well was created."

In the shipping industry, since fuel oil accounts for the largest portion of ship operation costs and its price is highly volatile, so companies can secure market competitiveness by making fuel oil purchasing decisions based on rational and scientific method. In this paper, short-term predictive analysis of HSFO 380CST in Singapore is conducted by using three recurrent neural network models like RNN, LSTM, and GRU. As a result, first, the forecasting performance of RNN models is better than LSTM and GRUs using long-term memory, and thus the predictive contribution of long-term information is low. Second, since the predictive performance of recurrent neural network models is superior to the previous studies using econometric models, it is confirmed that the recurrent neural network models should consider nonlinear properties of bunker price.

Accommodation sharing services such as Airbnb, which have recently expanded due to the spread of the sharing economy, are particularly affected by the pandemic because transactions are made based on trust and communication between consumer and supplier. As the pandemic situation changes individuals perceptions and behavior of travel, strategies for the recovery of the tourism industry have been discussed. However, since most studies present macro strategies in terms of traditional lodging providers and the government, there is a significant lack of discussion on differentiated pandemic response strategies considering the peculiarity of the sharing economy centered on peer-to-peer transactions. This study discusses the marketing strategy for individual hosts of Airbnb during COVID-19. We empirically analyze the effect of changes in listing descriptions posted by the Airbnb hosts on listing performance after COVID-19 was outbroken. We extract nine aspects described in the listing descriptions using the Attention-Based Aspect Extraction model, which is a deep learning-based aspect extraction method. We model the effect of aspect changes on listing performance after the COVID-19 by observing the frequency of each aspect appeared in the text. In addition, we compare those effects across the types of Airbnb listing. Through this, this study presents an idea for a pandemic crisis response strategy that individual service providers of accommodation sharing services can take depending on the listing type."

As the revival of Confucianism during Yuan Shikai’s reign became active, opposition from Christianity and other religious circles immediately intensified. Students and intellects baptized from western sciences and thoughts refused Confucianism as state religion and claimed anti-religion. Through New Youths, Young China, Life, and so on, religious debates of the period can be grasped.  Marxists defined religions as fantasies of future world and as opium of suppressed people, and asserted abolishment of them. Anarchists perceived religions as a kind of authoritative systems, and discerned that they infringed sciences and disturbed free developments of individual human beings. Scientism advocated that as all kinds of phenomena and problems among mankinds and in societies could be resolved within sciences, sciences should replace religions. Such anti-religious trends arose from opposition against Confucianism as state religion, and rapidly spread out within the upsurge of nationalism and anti-imperialism.   Regarding religions, Liang Qichao and Cai Yuanpei Chen Duxiu differed in their opinions by pros and cons, but were same in the point in which they understood religions as productions of emotions. Cai Yuanpei, the naysayer, separated religions from the boundaries of morals and education, and replaced them with aesthetic education. Chen Duxiu recognized the greatness and existence of Jesus from the emotional perspective excluding the sacred, and cultivated deep-seated affection by himself. Liu Boming Liang Shumíng Tu Xiaoshi who were friendly toward religions claimed that the essence of religions as a transcendental inner tendency is placed in each individual’s mind, and that it ought to be cultivated and guided. At the same time, they saw that a religion can be a competence maintaining social orders and cultural spirits. For the result from the fact that western science and ration overwhelmed hereditary Confucian tradition, the assertion that science should replace religion became fierce. Hu Shi with a strong atheistic tendency admired Jesus, but he respected merely his personality and achievements, and Christianity was not his religion. Chen Duxiu also fiercely criticized the Confucian tradition, saying that Jesus"" personality is admirable, but Christian doctrine is unreliable on scientific grounds.  Among Chinese intellects in the early 20<SUP>th</SUP> century, science gradually became an icon, it became hard to accept the value of religions’ existence within the trust on all-mighty of science. Youths and students thought that all religions were unscientific superstitions, and that as religions deprived human-beings’ rational capabilities and restrained liberty, so they were the biggest obstacles against humans’ progress. Regarding such all-mightiness of science, there were warnings and criticisms from Ling Qichao, but they did not show much power. The religious debates during the New Culture Movement can be considered as the victory of science. The status of science after the establishment of the Republic of China was never doubtable. Nevertheless, through this debate Chinese intellects could cultivate perceptions on religions and the Mystic Learning, and came to be incapable to unilaterally underestimate or to lightly judge religions. Also, church leaders came to keep an eye on the turbulent reality of China and to actively respond toward later issues of anti-religion and anti-Christianity."

In addition, he inherited the teachings of 『Seokyung(書經)』 and 『Book of Rites(禮記)』 that 'the sky is unselfish and fair' and expressed a free mind in his poems, free from greed for one's own destiny. And this mindset was developed into the content of 'Heaven and Man are originally one', which appears in 『Book of Change(易)』·『Book of Rites(禮記)』·『Book of Mind(心經)』 did.Yang Eung-su thought that it was important to get rid of '人慾' from the human mind in order to achieve the teachings of '天無私' and '天人一也' in the scriptures. So even in his poems, he expressed that in order to realize that the human heart(人心) and the dao heart(道心) are not two, we need to get rid of greed.However, it was not easy to achieve the state of the sage by making steady efforts. After immersing himself in Neo-Confucianism, he has cultivated and restrained himself for a long time, but there are still many things that need to be studied and practiced.Therefore, in his later years, even if he could not completely get rid of his greed, he also wrote a poem that pays attention not to lose the original intention given by heaven. Not only in modern society but also in the 18th century, when Yang Eung-su was active, social success represented by rising in the world and gaining fame was what most scholars were aiming for.However, Yang Eung-soo gave up such social achievements and jumped into the academic path of Neo-Confucianism, making it the most important goal of his life to achieve mental and physical training and academic achievement. His attitude toward life is reflected in his poems as well, so his poetry seems to leave a deep impression compared to the works of other ordinary poets."

Although these services used to answer customers questions according to a predetermined algorithm, the latest AI chat robot called ‘Iruda’ presents that it can communicate in a humanlike natural expression and context. AI chat robots have collected big data on the social media and performed deep learning. Now the technologies show natural sentence expression like human and become a private conversation partner.  However, a problem has been raised that the personal information collected for the development of the AI chat robot was actually in an illegal manner. Particularly controversial fact is that the personal information collected for the use of a specific service was used in another service later. The information was collected and analyzed with a very wide range in the process of developing. It seems that the person who only agreed for the use of the previous service had not fully recognized if his or her very sensitive information to be used for the newly developing service. Whereas the service developers intended that the process of consenting to personal information explained and included the chance to be used personal information for new services development in the future, it still has an issue of insufficient explanation such as the period of time and the range of information for the data subject.  Another problem is the case of illegally collecting and using the conversation information of the KakaoTalk chat conversation provided by some users during the development of the AI chat robot. In general, there are at least two participants in a chat room, but the developer did not receive consent for the collection and use of chat information from all participants. Therefore, this is an violation of the consent procedure for collection and use of personal information stipulated by the Personal Information Protection Act.  As this Iruda issue shows, it is a big problem for developers of new services to overlook the consent process for collection and use of personal information. In particular, personal conversation information collected in Kakaotalk chat where two or more people participate must obtain consent from each of the participating personal information subjects, and in the consent process for the development of a new service in the future, the period and the content and scope of the information used must be specified."

Theoretical research was conducted through academic papers, professional books, related articles, news, and Internet sites at home and abroad. For empirical research, fashion leather product video content is divided into basic, intermediate, and market research categories, and uploaded to YouTube (2019.04.27.～2020.02.27.) to provide prerequisite learning to students in a total of 5 courses in 2019 and 2020. After performing the study, the class was designed by participating in the class, and the degree of satisfaction with class participation was analyzed to study the possibility of flip-learning classes, and the following conclusions were obtained.  First, theoretical studies have shown that flip learning classes are a necessary learning method for fashion leather products courses that require repetitive learning through the channel-related examples of flip learning classes and fashion leather products. And YouTube, which has the largest share of video apps, was able to confirm that it is the best platform with easy accessibility for flip learning classes.  Second, after the flip learning class for fashion leather products using YouTube videos, an empirical study, an average of 92.6 points were recorded. The reason for the high satisfaction was that learners were able to conduct deep learning in class based on online learning by pre-learning with YouTube videos of fashion leather products. In addition, active communication and repetitive learning with teachers and students could prevent poor learning and induce self-directed classes. And by using repetitive learning, it was able to help learners organize their knowledge of fashion leather products. Third, the results of the ‘on-off-line class satisfaction’ survey averaged 90.45, and the result of the ‘on-off-line education environment’ was 89.4 points, indicating the need to create an online and offline convergence class environment for fashion leather products.

The deep learning structure consists of a convolution layer, a bottleneck layer, a fully connect layer, and a softmax layer. The convolution layer is a layer that obtains a feature image by performing a convolution 3x3 operation on the input image or the feature image of the previous layer with several feature filters. The bottleneck layer selects only the optimal features among the features on the feature image extracted through the convolution layer, reduces the channel to a convolution 1x1 ReLU, and performs a convolution 3x3 ReLU. The global average pooling operation performed after going through the bottleneck layer reduces the size of the feature image by selecting only the optimal features among the features of the feature image extracted through the convolution layer. The fully connect layer outputs the output data through 6 fully connect layers. The softmax layer multiplies and multiplies the value between the value of the input layer node and the target node to be calculated, and converts it into a value between 0 and 1 through an activation function. After the learning is completed, the recognition process classifies non-circular glass bottles by performing image acquisition using a camera, measuring position detection, and non-circular glass bottle classification using deep learning as in the learning process. In order to evaluate the performance of the deep learning structure to improve quality of polygonal containers, as a result of an experiment at an authorized testing institute, it was calculated to be at the same level as the world’s highest level with 99% good/defective discrimination accuracy. Inspection time averaged 1.7 seconds, which was calculated within the operating time standards of production processes using non-circular machine vision systems. Therefore, the effectiveness of the performance of the deep learning structure to improve quality of polygonal containers proposed in this paper was proven."

To investigate the diagnostic performance of the deep learning algorithm, we calculated the receiver operating characteristics (ROC), precision-recall curve (PRC) plots, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) and compared them with the performance of radiologists with different levels of experience.Results: The area under the ROC plot generated by the deep learning algorithm and radiologists was 0.988 and 0.988–0.919, respectively. The area under the PRC plot generated by the deep learning algorithm and radiologists was 0.973 and 0.618– 0.958, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the proposed deep learning algorithm were 98.0, 98.1, 84.5, and 99.8%, respectively. There was no significant difference in the diagnosis of DDH by the algorithm and the radiologist with experience in pediatric radiology (p = 0.180). However, the proposed model showed higher sensitivity, specificity, and PPV, compared to the radiologist without experience in pediatric radiology (p < 0.001).Conclusion: The proposed deep learning algorithm provided an accurate diagnosis of DDH on hip radiographs, which was comparable to the diagnosis by an experienced radiologist."

As the deep learning model grows, a large amount of data is required to learn it, but there are cases in which it is difficult to integrate and learn the data because the data is distributed among several owners and security issues. In that situation we conducted parallel learning for each users that own data and then studied how to integrate it. For this, distributed learning was performed for each owner assuming the security situation as V-environment and H-environment, and the results of distributed learning were integrated using Average, Max, and AbsMax.

The proposed method detects the ROI of spectral signals using a deep learning model trained with simulated data. Since the peak of the spectral signal contains physical and chemical information of the substance, accurate peak detection is an important process affecting the performance of the analyzed system. The widely used method for peak detection is the one based on the amplitude. However, this method is complex and subjective because it involves pre-processing or select and estimate parameters using visual inspection according to spectral signals. To overcome this problem, ROI detection of the spectral signal was performed through a deep learning model. The proposed method has the advantage of requiring no pre-processing and parameter setting. In addition, a peak may be obtained by performing post-processing of the spectral signal according to the detected ROI. Performance evaluation was performed through loss values obtained by applying 30,000 test data to the custom loss function. The proposed deep learning model combining ResNet and Unet showed performance improvements of 76.5%, 69.8%, and 5.9% compared to the general convolutional neural network (CNN), ResNet, and Unet, respectively.

Randomness of stock prices can be resolved to some extent with deep learning algorithms, but external impacts such as the macro-environment surrounding stock prices and rapid changes in the market are factors that make it difficult to predict stock prices, and how to resolve them is the key to the stock price prediction model. Existing stock price prediction research has often used technical indicators.

Recent various discussions about AI presuppose the coexistence of humans and AI. Meanwhile, in order for coexistence to be achieved, it is fundamentally necessary for humans as individual beings to form relationships with others in an appropriate way. This study focused on the use of the virtue education method among the methods for AI to learn the order of relationships as an AMA that becomes the counterpart of human ethical behavior in the interaction between humans and AI. Method: This study presented basic data using the method of literature research. And based on this, a virtue education method that can be applied to AMA was developed and presented using the method of development research. With this, This research tried to argue about the necessity and validity of the virtue education method. Results: This study examines that the current discussion on ethical learning in AMA is mainly based on a Top-down approach based on traditional ethical theory. And as an alternative to this, it is suggested that machine learning and deep learning methods can be used as a method for AMA to learn ethics. Based on this, the characteristics and validity of virtue ethics applicable to AMA were presented. And as a method to learn it, a teaching and learning method applicable to the learning of AMA was proposed. Conclusion: Currently, the approach to preparing ethics for AMA tends to mainly choose a Top-down approach in which a specific ethical theory is selected and the design of a computational algorithm and system that can implement the theory is derived. However, just as children develop moral reasoning through appropriate developmental stages, AMA also needs to actively introduce a bottom-up approach to forming ethical judgment principles. As a specific method, we propose to use the method of grafting the virtue education method of analyzing the characteristics of a virtuous person and repeating it by imitating it to the deep learning method of AI."

Thus, prediction of turbid water is essential for water environmental management. Recently, various advanced machine learning algorithms have been increasingly used in water environmental management. Ensemble machine learning algorithms such as random forest (RF) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) are some of the most popular machine learning algorithms used for water environmental management, along with deep learning algorithms such as recurrent neural networks. In this study GBDT, an ensemble machine learning algorithm, and gated recurrent unit (GRU), a recurrent neural networks algorithm, are used for model development to predict turbidity in a river. The observation frequencies of input data used for the model were 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 120 and 168 h. The root-mean-square error-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR) of GRU and GBDT ranges between 0.182~0.766 and 0.400~0.683, respectively. Both models show similar prediction accuracy with RSR of 0.682 for GRU and 0.683 for GBDT. The GRU shows better prediction accuracy when the observation frequency is relatively short (i.e., 2, 4, and 8 h) where GBDT shows better prediction accuracy when the observation frequency is relatively long (i.e. 48, 120, 160 h). The results suggest that the characteristics of input data should be considered to develop an appropriate model to predict turbidity."
Image Denoising with a Convolution Neural Network using Gaussian Filtered Residuals,2021,"['Convolutional neural network', 'Deep learning', 'Gaussian noise', 'Image denoising']",,"Deep learning using a convolutional neural network has become a state-of-art technique in image processing. In recent scenarios, image denoising using a residual image in deep learning has been popular. However, one aspect missing in these methods is that the residual image has all the noise and very small structured details of the input image. Therefore, we have developed a Gaussian filter residual convolutional neural network architecture for color image denoising. Gaussian residual learning was used to boost the denoising performance. The architecture is designed to remove additive white Gaussian noise, which is one of the most basic types of noise that affects an image when captured. The network with Gaussian residual learning removes the clean image using the features learned from the hidden layer. The peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index measure achieved by our method reveals that the presented approach is better at denoising images with Gaussian noise than a convolutional neural network."

In particular, studies on the synthesis of Text to Image that automatically generate images from text are being actively conducted. Deep learning for image synthesis requires a vast amount of data consisting of pairs of images and text describing the image. Therefore, various data augmentation techniques have been devised to generate a large amount of data from small data. A number of text augmentation techniques based on synonym replacement have been proposed so far. However, these techniques have a common limitation in that there is a possibility of generating a incorrect text from the content of an image when replacing the synonym for a noun word. In this study, we propose a text augmentation method to replace words using word hierarchy information for noun words. Additionally, we performed experiments using MSCOCO data in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology."

Recent studies adopt machine-learning models for detecting cracks in asphalt road pavement using a Convolutional Neural Network. However, their practical use is limited because they require high-performance computing power.

This problem involves more complex states and action spaces than traditional confrontation games, making it difficult to search for any strategy with human-level performance. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning model to solve this problem from the perspective of game simulations and algorithm implementation. A reverse reinforcement-learning model based on high-level player training data is established to support downstream algorithms. With less training data, the proposed model is converged quicker, and more consistent with the action strategies of high-level players’ decision-making. Then an intelligent deduction algorithm based on DDQN is developed to achieve a better generalization ability under the guidance of a given reward function. At the game simulation level, this paper constructs Monte Carlo Tree SearchIntelligent Decision Model for turn-based antagonistic deduction games to generate next-step actions. Furthermore, a prototype game simulator that combines offline with online functions is implemented to verify the performance of proposed model and algorithm. The experiments show that our proposed approach not only has a better reference value to the antagonistic environment using incomplete information, but also accurate and effective in predicting the return value.

통합 이미지 처리 기술을 이용한 콘크리트 교량 균열 탐지 및 매핑,2021,"['concrete crack', 'deep learning', 'orthomosaic', 'drone', 'cascade mask R-CNN']",,"In many developed countries, such as South Korea, efficiently maintaining the aging infrastructures is an important issue. Currently, inspectors visually inspect the infrastructure for maintenance needs, but this method is inefficient due to its high costs, long logistic times, and hazards to the inspectors. Thus, in this paper, a novel crack inspection approach for concrete bridges is proposed using integrated image processing techniques. The proposed approach consists of four steps: (1) training a deep learning model to automatically detect cracks on concrete bridges, (2) acquiring in-situ images using a drone, (3) generating orthomosaic images based on 3D modeling, and (4) detecting cracks on the orthmosaic image using the trained deep learning model. Cascade Mask R-CNN, a state-of-the-art instance segmentation deep learning model, was trained with 3235 crack images that included 2415 hard negative images. We selected the Tancheon overpass, located in Seoul, South Korea, as a testbed for the proposed approach, and we captured images of pier 34-37 and slab 34-36 using a commercial drone. Agisoft Metashape was utilized as a 3D model generation program to generate an orthomosaic of the captured images. We applied the proposed approach to four orthomosaic images that displayed the front, back, left, and right sides of pier 37. Using pixel-level precision referencing visual inspection of the captured images, we evaluated the trained Cascade Mask R-CNN's crack detection performance. At the coping of the front side of pier 37, the model obtained its best precision: 94.34%. It achieved an average precision of 72.93% for the orthomosaics of the four sides of the pier. The test results show that this proposed approach for crack detection can be a suitable alternative to the conventional visual inspection method."

This challenge has been overcame by the advent of recent deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), by modeling the mapping function between 2D image and 3D information. However, to train such deep CNNs, a massive training data is demanded, but such data is difficult to achieve or even impossible to build. Recent trends thus aim to present deep learning techniques that can be trained in a weakly-supervised manner, with a meta-data without relying on the ground-truth depth data.

Considering the current degree of development of AI technology, it is thought that the issue of copyright infringement occurring in AI learning stage should be solved more urgently than the issue of copyright infringement occurring in use stage of AI output. Artificial intelligence learning step requires large-scale data input and the use of almost all works as data, making it difficult to solve with conventional fair use law. Accordingly legislative cases in each country, including South Korea, are trying to solve the issue of copyright infringement that may occur in the AI ​​learning stage by placing a new fair use clause or a clause allowing text data mining (TDM). On the other hand, I am of the view that copyright infringement that may occur in the stage of using AI output can be largely resolved by the existing laws of infringement and tort liability. However, even in this area, ""depending on the development of technology,"" there could be marginal cases that are difficult for existing legal principles to solve.Whether an artificial intelligence output has creativity or copyright- ability is a matter that is directly related to whether an artificial intelligence output can infringe on other's copyright. On one side of the view that the copyrightability of artificial intelligence output should be denied, it seems that the current artificial intelligence output can only be used in limited areas such as stock articles, weather articles, and sampling music. Looking at the level of AI(GAN) artwork, chatbot and language translation using NLP, it is necessary to examine in detail whether the AI ​​technology grasps the context from a semantic point of view, and whether creative individuality is expressed accordingly. It is my view that whether pattern recognition, numerical vectorization of characteristics, and probabilistic models adopted by artificial intelligence technology have reached the point where AI can understand human expressions from the viewpoint of semantics not syntactics should be judged legally in the concrete case. An abundance of these discussions will lead to appropriate conclusions on whether to provide legal protection for artificial intelligence output or who to hold legally liable for situations in which artificial intelligence output is believed to infringe on other people's copyrights.This study also discusses the legal nature of open-source license associated with the Edmond de Belamy portrait case. In the AI development process, open source is widely used in the form of open source-based development platforms such as TensorFlow, development tools, and machine learning libraries such as PyTorch. Since AI development requires extensive human and material resources, it is taking an open source community-based development method in which various developers can participate. Regarding the legal treatment of artificial intelligence's achievements and output, it is also necessary to note the legal nature of open-source license applied in the development and distribution process of AI output."

In addition, since market volatility has been elevated significantly by a combination of many factors included global resurgences in the COVID-19 pandemic, many investors in South Korea hardly reach their financial goals or deliver returns. Therefore, banks are trying to providing their own Robo-Advisors to manage clients’ portfolios without human interaction following self-developed algorithms. In this regard, it is becomingmore important to find an optimal hyper-parameter combination. This study compares some stochastic gradient desecent algorithms of deep Q-network to select a seqeunce of actions so as to maximize the long-termreward. Among AdaGrad, RMSprop and Adamoptimizers, RMSprop alleviates this financial decision-making problem to improve performance. The main result shows that the deep Q-network based on RMSprop optimizer was significant to learn trading rules. In comparison to AdaGrad and Adam, RMSprop seems to be a little more robust as the cumulative rewards increase significanlty along with the first few epidoes, and then it oscillates slights, showing increasing trend up to the final episodes.

With the accumulation of medical records, the evolution of computational power and graphics processing units, and the widespread use of open-source libraries in large-scale machine learning processes, medical artificial intelligence (AI) is overcoming its limitations. While early studies prioritized the automatic diagnosis of cancer or pre-cancerous lesions, the current expanded scope of AI includes benign lesions, quality control, and machine learning analysis of big data. However, the limited commercialization of medical AI and the need to justify its application in each field of research are restricting factors. Modeling assumes that observations follow certain statistical rules, and external validation checks whether assumption is correct or generalizable. Therefore, unused data are essential in the training or internal testing process to validate the performance of the established AI models. This article summarizes the studies on the application of AI models in upper gastrointestinal disorders. The current limitations and the perspectives on future development have also been discussed."

The use of brightness information is to solve the limitation that the intrinsic color of the image easily changes according to the change in brightness when only color information is used in lesion segmentation. Classifying lesions by deep learning is to more accurately discriminate the skin diseases with complex and nonlinear properties. In order to obtain the brightness information of an image, gray model having 256 levels of pixel values is used.

Besides, companies that develop, distribute, or utilize innovative new technologies such as artificial intelligence have a problem that it is difficult to accurately predict a companys future stock returns and volatility due to macro-environment and market uncertainty. Market uncertainty is recognized as an obstacle to the activation and spread of artificial intelligence technology, so research is needed to mitigate this. Hence, the purpose of this study is to propose a machine learning model that predicts the volatility of a companys stock price by using the internet search volume of artificial intelligence-related technology keywords as a measure of the interest of investors. To this end, for predicting the stock market, we using the VAR(Vector Auto Regression) and deep neural network LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). And the stock price prediction performance using keyword search volume is compared according to the technologys social acceptance stage. In addition, we also conduct the analysis of sub-technology of artificial intelligence technology to examine the change in the search volume of detailed technology keywords according to the technology acceptance stage and the effect of interest in specific technology on the stock market forecast. To this end, in this study, the words artificial intelligence, deep learning, machine learning were selected as keywords. Next, we investigated how many keywords each week appeared in online documents for five years from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2019. The stock price and transaction volume data of KOSDAQ listed companies were also collected and used for analysis. As a result, we found that the keyword search volume for artificial intelligence technology increased as the social acceptance of artificial intelligence technology increased. In particular, starting from AlphaGo Shock, the keyword search volume for artificial intelligence itself and detailed technologies such as machine learning and deep learning appeared to increase. Also, the keyword search volume for artificial intelligence technology increases as the social acceptance stage progresses. It showed high accuracy, and it was confirmed that the acceptance stages showing the best prediction performance were different for each keyword. As a result of stock price prediction based on keyword search volume for each social acceptance stage of artificial intelligence technologies classified in this study, the awareness stages prediction accuracy was found to be the highest. The prediction accuracy was different according to the keywords used in the stock price prediction model for each social acceptance stage. Therefore, when constructing a stock price prediction model using technology keywords, it is necessary to consider social acceptance of the technology and sub-technology classification. The results of this study provide the following implications. First, to predict the return on investment for companies based on innovative technology, it is most important to capture the recognition stage in which public interest rapidly increases in social acceptance of the technology. Second, the change in keyword search volume and the accuracy of the prediction model varies according to the social acceptance of technology should be considered in developing a Decision Support System for investment such as the big data-based Robo-advisor recently introduced by the financial sector."

A Novel Spiking Neural Network for ECG signal Classification,2021,"['Deep neural network', 'Spiking neural network', 'Binarized SNN', 'Electrocardiogram', 'ECG', 'classification']",,"The electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most extensively employed signals used to diagnose and predict cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In recent years, several deep learning (DL) models have been proposed to improve detection accuracy. Among these, deep neural networks (DNNs) are the most popular, wherein the features are extracted automatically. Despite the increment in classification accuracy, DL models require exorbitant computational resources and power. This causes the mapping of DNNs to be slow; in addition, the mapping is challenging for a wearable device. Embedded systems have constrained power and memory resources. Therefore full-precision DNNs are not easily deployable on devices. To make the neural network faster and more power-efficient, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have been introduced for fewer operations and less complex hardware resources. However, the conventional SNN has low accuracy and high computational cost. Therefore, this paper proposes a new binarized SNN which modifies the synaptic weights of SNN constraining it to be binary (+1 and -1). In the simulation results, this paper compares the DL models and SNNs and evaluates which model is optimal for ECG classification. Although there is a slight compromise in accuracy, the latter proves to be energy-efficient."

After the transient response decays out, the forced vibration behaviour of a structure due to a harmonic excitation force can be expressed as a linear combination of its vibration modes. Since the participation factor of each vibration mode varies depending on the frequency of the excitation force, its location, and distribution, only a few vibration modes with large participation factors can be used to approximate the forced vibration behaviour. To estimate this participation factor, a convolutional neural network model was trained using appropriate input and output data. The proposed and trained deep learning model showed high accuracy against test data. Furthermore, its areas of application were discussed."

Not only does this devastating disease record a very high mortality rate, but it can also cause serious chronic impairment of sensory, motor, and cognitive functions. Therefore, a prompt and professional diagnosis of the disease is highly critical. Noninvasive brain imaging data are essential for clinicians to efficiently diagnose the locus of brain lesion, volume of bleeding, and subsequent cortical damage, and to take clinical interventions. In particular, computed tomography (CT) images are used most often for the diagnosis of ICH. In order to diagnose ICH through CT images, not only medical specialists with a sufficient number of diagnosis experiences are required, but even when this condition is met, there are many cases where bleeding cannot be successfully detected due to factors such as low signal ratio and artifacts of the image itself. In addition, discrepancies between interpretations or even misinterpretations might exist causing critical clinical consequences. To resolve these clinical problems, we developed a diagnostic model predicting intracranial bleeding and its subtypes (intraparenchymal, intraventricular, subarachnoid, subdural, and epidural) by applying deep learning algorithms to CT images. We also constructed a visualization tool highlighting important regions in a CT image for predicting ICH. Specifically, 1) 27,758 CT brain images from RSNA were pre-processed to minimize the computational load. 2) Three different CNN-based models (ResNet, EfficientNet-B2, and EfficientNet-B7) were trained based on a training image data set. 3) Diagnosis performance of each of the three models was evaluated based on an independent test image data set: As a result of the model comparison, EfficientNet-B7's performance (classification accuracy = 91%) was a way greater than the other models. 4) Finally, based on the result of EfficientNet-B7, we visualized the lesions of internal bleeding using the Grad-CAM.

The framework was proposed to automatically quantify the periodontal bone loss and classify periodontitis for each individual tooth into four stages according to the criteria that was proposed at the 2017 World Workshop. Radiographic bone level (or CEJ level) was detected using deep learning with a simple structure of the entire jaw in panoramic radiographs. Next, the percent ratio analysis of the radiographic bone loss combined the tooth long-axis with periodontal bone and CEJ levels. The percentage ratios can be used to automatically classify periodontal bone loss. Additionally, the number of missing teeth was quantified by detecting the position of the missing teeth in the panoramic radiographs. A multi-device study was also performed to verify the generality of the developed method. The mean absolute difference (MAD) between periodontitis stages by the automatic method and by the radiologists was 0.31 overall for all the teeth in the whole jaw. The MADs for the images from the multiple devices were 0.25, 0.34, and 0.35 for devices 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

The proposed parametric activation function can be obtained by applying a parameter that can convert the scale and location of the activation function according to the characteristics of the input data, and the loss function can be minimized without limiting the derivative of the activation function through the backpropagation process. Through the XOR problem with 10 hidden layers and the MNIST classification problem with 8 hidden layers, the performance of the original nonlinear and parametric activation functions was compared, and it was confirmed that the proposed parametric activation function has superior performance in alleviating the vanishing gradient."

Liver-to-Spleen Volume Ratio Automatically Measured on CT Predicts Decompensation in Patients with B Viral Compensated Cirrhosis,2021,"['Deep learning', 'Cirrhosis', 'Liver', 'Spleen', 'Outcomes research', 'Hepatitis B']",,"Objective: Although the liver-to-spleen volume ratio (LSVR) based on CT reflects portal hypertension, its prognostic role in cirrhotic patients has not been proven. We evaluated the utility of LSVR, automatically measured from CT images using a deep learning algorithm, as a predictor of hepatic decompensation and transplantation-free survival in patients with hepatitis B viral (HBV)-compensated cirrhosis.Materials and Methods: A deep learning algorithm was used to measure the LSVR in a cohort of 1027 consecutive patients (mean age, 50.5 years; 675 male and 352 female) with HBV-compensated cirrhosis who underwent liver CT (2007–2010). Associations of LSVR with hepatic decompensation and transplantation-free survival were evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards and competing risk analyses, accounting for either the Child-Pugh score (CPS) or Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and other variables. The risk of the liver-related events was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Aalen-Johansen estimator.Results: After adjustment for either CPS or MELD and other variables, LSVR was identified as a significant independent predictor of hepatic decompensation (hazard ratio for LSVR increase by 1, 0.71 and 0.68 for CPS and MELD models, respectively; p < 0.001) and transplantation-free survival (hazard ratio for LSVR increase by 1, 0.8 and 0.77, respectively; p < 0.001). Patients with an LSVR of < 2.9 (n = 381) had significantly higher 3-year risks of hepatic decompensation (16.7% vs. 2.5%, p < 0.001) and liver-related death or transplantation (10.0% vs. 1.1%, p < 0.001) than those with an LSVR ≥ 2.9 (n = 646). When patients were stratified according to CPS (Child-Pugh A vs. B–C) and MELD (< 10 vs. ≥ 10), an LSVR of < 2.9 was still associated with a higher risk of liver-related events than an LSVR of ≥ 2.9 for all Child-Pugh (p ≤ 0.045) and MELD (p ≤ 0.009) stratifications.Conclusion: The LSVR measured on CT can predict hepatic decompensation and transplantation-free survival in patients with HBV-compensated cirrhosis."

Most previous solutions commonly employ homomorphic encryption schemes based on Ring Learning with Errors (RLWE) hardness or two-party secure computation protocols to achieve it. However, they have limitations on large communication overheads and costs in MCC. To address this issue, we present LeHE4SCNN, a scalable privacy-preserving and communication-efficient framework for CNN-based DLaaS. Firstly, we design a novel low-expansion rate homomorphic encryption scheme with packing and unpacking methods (LeHE). It supports fast homomorphic operations such as vector-matrix multiplication and addition. Then we propose a secure prediction framework for CNN. It employs the LeHE scheme to compute linear layers while exploiting the data shuffling technique to perform non-linear operations. Finally, we implement and evaluate LeHE4SCNN with various CNN models on a real-world dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the LeHE4SCNN framework in terms of response time, usage cost, and communication overhead compared to the state-of-the-art methods in the mobile cloud computing environment."

The study participants expressed a positive opinion that the quality of the lesson could be improved by structuring the lesson through the physical education lesson to which the blended running was applied, and striving to achieve the learning goal and stimulate it. However, there were also side effects. Due to the characteristics of blended learning in parallel with online lessons and school attendance lessons, it was not uncommon for students to accept lessons in a passive and passive manner, and it became clear that feedback and evaluation for learning were difficult. Based on this, we proposed the direction of a follow-up survey of physical education classes using blended running."

The proposed system consists of a server and an edge. The server manages the data, learns the advertisement recommendation model, and uses the trained advertisement recommendation model to determine the advertisements to be promoted in real time. The advertisement recommendation model provides predictions for various products and probabilities. The purchase index between the product and weather data was extracted and reflected using correlation analysis to improve the accuracy of predicting the probability of purchasing a product. First, the user information and product information are input to a deep neural network as a vector through an embedding process. With this information, the product candidate group generation model reduces the product candidates that can be purchased by a certain user. The advertisement recommendation model uses a wide and deep recommendation model to derive the recommendation list by predicting the probability of purchase for the selected products. Finally, the most suitable advertisements are selected using the predicted probability of purchase for all the users within the advertisement range. The proposed system does not communicate with the server. Therefore, it determines the advertisements using a model trained at the edge. It can also be applied to digital signage that requires immediate response from several users."

Is c-command Machine-learnable?,2021,"['c-command', 'deep learning', 'BERT', 'surprisal', 'NPI', 'reflexive anaphor']",,"Many psycholinguistic studies have tested whether pronouns and polarity items elicit additional processing cost when they are not c-commanded. The previous studies claim that the c-command constraint regulates the distribution of relevant syntactic objects. As such, the syntactic effects of the c-command relation are greatly affected by the types of licensing (e.g. quantificational binding) and reading comprehension patterns of subjects (e.g. linguistic illusion). The present study investigates the reading behavior of the language model BERT when the syntactic processing of relational information (i.e. X c-commands Y) is required. Specifically, our two experiments contrasted the BERT comprehension of a c-commanding licensor versus a non-c-commanding licensor with reflexive anaphora and negative polarity items. The analysis based on the information-theoretic measure of surprisal suggests that violations of the c-command constraint are unexpected for BERT representations. We conclude that deep learning models like BERT can learn the syntactic c-command restriction at least with respect to reflexive anaphors and negative polarity items. At the same time, BERT appeared to have some limitations in its flexibility to apply compensatory pragmatic reasoning when a non-c-commanding licensor intruded in the dependency structure."

The CT images were aligned to the corresponding MR images using a deformable registration, and the metallic dummy source markers were delineated using threshold-based segmentation followed by manual modification. The deformed CT (dCT), MR, and segmentation mask pairs were used for training and testing.

The performance of the model was evaluated with intensity-based comparison metrics.Results: The proposed model with segmentation loss outperformed the 3D U-Net in terms of errors between the sCT and dCT. The structural similarity score difference was not significant. Conclusions: Our study shows the two-task-based deep learning models for generating the sCT images using low-tesla MR images for 3D ICR.

Since the southern coastal region of the Korean peninsula was originally dominated by warm-temperate evergreen broad-leaved forests, it is desirable to restore forests in this region to their original vegetation. In this study, we identified suitable areas to be restored as evergreen broad-leaved forests by analyzing the environmental factors of existing evergreen broad-leaved forests in the islands of Jeollanam-do. We classified forest lands in the study area into six vegetation types from Sentinel-2 satellite images using a deep learning algorithm and analyzed the tolerance ranges of existing evergreen broad-leaved forests by measuring the locational, topographic, and climatic attributes of the classified vegetation types. Results showed that evergreen broad-leaved forests were distributed more in areas with a high altitudes and steep slope, where human intervention was relatively low. The human intervention has led to a higher distribution of evergreen broad-leaved forests in areas with lower annual average temperature, which was an unexpected but understandable result because an area with higher altitude has a lower temperature. Of the environmental factors, latitude and average temperature in the coldest month (January) were relatively less contaminated by the effects of human intervention, thus enabling the identification of suitable restoration areas of the evergreen broad-leaved forests. The tolerance range analysis of evergreen broad-leaved forests showed that they mainly grew in areas south of the latitude of 34.7° and a monthly average temperature of 1.7°C or higher in the coldest month. Therefore, we predicted the areas meeting these criteria to be suitable for restoring evergreen broad-leaved forests. The suitable areas cover 614.5 ㎢, which occupies 59.0% of the total forest lands on the islands of Jeollanamdo, and 73% of actual forests that exclude agricultural and other non-restorable forest lands. The findings of this study can help forest managers prepare a restoration plan and budget for island forests."

An RNN is an artificial neural network in which the connection between units is composed of a cyclic structure that can reflect the characteristics of time series. Therefore, to eventually incorporate a model predictive control technique for energy demand and supply matching, this study uses previously measured weather data and PV power generation data to predict the future PV power generation.Various optimization processes, such as normalization, classification of learning data, and setting of layer options, are performed to create a predictive model. Furthermore, 500 hidden neurons and 1 and 3 hidden layers are created and compared. The initial learning rate for both single and multiple-layer options was set to 0.05. As a result, the coefficient of variation of the root mean squared error, Cv(RMSE), which is a statistical index to assess the overall accuracy of the predicted values, was 13.8 % for a single layer and 13.2 % for a multiple-layer long short term memory model. Although no significant difference was observed between the two models, the multiple-layer model showed a slightly reduced error rate than the single-layer model, and the accurate prediction was confirmed to be achievable. Based on this study, a stable energy supply system can be established through linkage with energy storage control by predicting the amount of energy production through renewable energy sources and the amount of energy demand at urban scale."

If the generation in the engineering aspect is mainly to judge the presence or absence of a quantitative indicator or the correct answer and the incorrect answer, the creation in the artistic aspect creates a creation that interprets the world and human life by cross-validating and doubting the correct answer and incorrect answer from various perspectives. In this paper, the video generation ability of deep learning was interpreted from the perspective of collage and compared with the results made by the artist. The characteristic of the experiment is to compare and analyze how much GAN reproduces the result of the creator made with the collage technique and the difference between the creative part, and investigate the satisfaction level by making performance evaluation items for the reproducibility of GAN. In order to experiment on how much the creators statement and purpose of expression were reproduced, a deep learning algorithm corresponding to the statement keyword was found and its similarity was compared. As a result of the experiment, GAN did not meet much expectations to express the collage technique. Nevertheless, the image association showed higher satisfaction than human ability, which is a positive discovery that GAN can show comparable ability to humans in terms of abstract creation."

Automated detection of corrosion in used nuclear fuel dry storage canisters using residual neural networks,2021,"['Convolutional neural networks', 'Corrosion', 'Deep learning', 'Dry storage canisters', 'Feature detection', 'Residual neural networks']",,"Nondestructive evaluation methods play an important role in ensuring component integrity and safety in many industries. Operator fatigue can play a critical role in the reliability of such methods. This is important for inspecting high value assets or assets with a high consequence of failure, such as aerospace and nuclear components. Recent advances in convolution neural networks can support and automate these inspection efforts. This paper proposes using residual neural networks (ResNets) for real-time detection of corrosion, including iron oxide discoloration, pitting and stress corrosion cracking, in dry storage stainless steel canisters housing used nuclear fuel. The proposed approach crops nuclear canister images into smaller tiles, trains a ResNet on these tiles, and classifies images as corroded or intact using the per-image count of tiles predicted as corroded by the ResNet. The results demonstrate that such a deep learning approach allows to detect the locus of corrosion via smaller tiles, and at the same time to infer with high accuracy whether an image comes from a corroded canister. Thereby, the proposed approach holds promise to automate and speed up nuclear fuel canister inspections, to minimize inspection costs, and to partially replace human-conducted onsite inspections, thus reducing radiation doses to personnel."

The images of the two successive scans were used to train the CycleGAN framework for image-to-image translation. The denoising efficacy of the CycleGAN algorithm was compared with that of hybrid and model-based iterative reconstruction. Repeated-measures analysis of variance and Wilcoxon signedrank test were performed to compare the objective measurements and the subjective image quality scores, respectively.Results: With the optimized CycleGAN denoising model, using the ULDCT images as input, the peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index improved by 2.0 dB and 0.21, respectively. The CycleGAN-generated denoised ULDCT images typically provided satisfactory image quality for optimal visibility of anatomic structures and pathological findings, with a lower level of image noise (mean ± standard deviation [SD], 19.5 ± 3.0 Hounsfield unit [HU]) than that of the hybrid (66.3 ± 10.5 HU, p < 0.001) and a similar noise level to model-based iterative reconstruction (19.6 ± 2.6 HU, p > 0.908). The CycleGAN-generated images showed the highest contrast-to-noise ratios for the pulmonary lesions, followed by the model-based and hybrid iterative reconstruction. The mean effective radiation dose of ULDCT was 0.12 mSv with a mean 93.9% reduction compared to standard-dose CT.Conclusion: The optimized CycleGAN technique may allow the synthesis of diagnostically acceptable images from ULDCT of the chest for the evaluation of pulmonary tuberculosis."

They often live without knowing whether their portraits have been synthesized into these images, and they often learn about their damage by their surroundings, so they do not have proper countermeasures, needless to say not to being prevented. Using deep fake technology makes it easier for individuals to create, sell, and distribute these sexual abuse videos as much as they want. In this case, due to the nature of online-network system, once a video or photo is synthesized and distributed, it is impossible to re-collect once posted, and it is extremely difficult to prevent the spread, so infringement of personal rights is not easy to remedy damage. There are several types of damages about personal rights that can be made by individuals. This paper studies the act of producing, distributing, and selling pornography using deep fake technology, especially spreading videos made with these technologies as fake news. And as can be seen from the act of defaming the victim using fake news or deep fake videos using Social Network Service, the perpetrator approached the victim through SNS or found out personal information, causing damage to the victim. The purpose of this study is to examine the way to get liabilities of victims by infringement, such as areas due to such stalking crimes. Regulations and the provisions should be reorganized so that victims can receive compensation for damages for illegal infringement occurring in the three areas. If the victim is harmed with malicious intentions, punitive liability for damages may also be considered."

To solve this problem, a multimode convolution neural network method is proposed to effectively improve the performance of facial expression recognition in video. Firstly, OpenFace 2.0 is used to detect face images in video, and two deep convolution neural networks are used to extract spatiotemporal expression features. Furthermore, spatial convolution neural network is used to extract the spatial information features of each static expression image, and the dynamic information feature is extracted from the optical flow information of multiple expression images based on temporal convolution neural network. Then, the spatiotemporal features learned by the two deep convolution neural networks are fused by multiplication. Finally, the fused features are input into support vector machine to realize the facial expression classification. Experimental results show that the recognition accuracy of the proposed method can reach 64.57% and 60.89%, respectively on RML and Baum-ls datasets.

DDPG uses off-policy that uses ϵ-greedy policy for selecting action of current time step and greed policy for the next step. In the simulation, learning is given by negative reward when moving near singulairty, and positive reward when moving away from the singularity and moving to target point. The reward equation consists of distance to target point and singularity, manipulability, and arrival flag.

사이버비행 요인 파악 및 예측모델 개발: 혼합방법론 접근,2021,"['Juvenile cyber deviance', 'Econometric analysis', 'Deep learning']",,"PurposeCyber deviance of adolescents has become a serious social problem. With a widespread use of smartphones, incidents of cyber deviance have increased in Korea and both quantitative and qualitative damages such as suicide and depression are increasing. Research has been conducted to understand diverse factors that explain adolescents’ delinquency in cyber space. However, most previous studies have focused on a single theory or perspective. Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively analyze motivations of juvenile cyber deviance and to develop a predictive model for delinquent adolescents by integrating four different theories on cyber deviance.Design/methodology/approachBy using data from Korean Children & Youth Panel Survey 2010, this study extracts 27 potential factors for cyber deivance based on four background theories including general strain, social learning, social bonding, and routine activity theories. Then this study employs econometric analysis to empirically assess the impact of potential factors and utilizes a machine learning approach to predict the likelihood of cyber deviance by adolescents.FindingsThis study found that general strain factors as well as social learning factors have positive effects on cyber deviance. Routine activity-related factors such as real-life delinquent behaviors and online activities also positively influence the likelihood of cyber diviance. On the other hand, social bonding factors such as community commitment and attachment to community lessen the likelihood of cyber deviance while social factors related to school activities are found to have positive impacts on cyber deviance. This study also found a predictive model using a deep learning algorithm indicates the highest prediction performance. This study contributes to the prevention of cyber deviance of teenagers in practice by understanding motivations for adolescents’ delinquency and predicting potential cyber deviants."

Therefore, several studies have been conducted to overcome this problem, and one of them is a signal processing method based on wavelet transform. Up to now, discrete wavelet transform, which can compress the trace, has been mostly used for power side-channel power analysis because continuous wavelet transform techniques increase data size and analysis time, and there is no efficient scale selection method. In this paper, we propose an efficient scale selection method optimized for power analysis attacks. Furthermore, we show that the analysis performance can be greatly improved when using the proposed method.

이미지 감성분류를 위한 CNN과 K-means RGB Cluster 이-단계 학습 방안,2021,"['이미지 감성분류', '색감', '이-단계 학습', 'Sentiment Analysis of Image', 'Sense of Color', 'CNN', 'Two-stage learning']",,"The biggest reason for using a deep learning model in image classification is that it is possible to consider the relationship between each region by extracting each regions features from the overall information of the image. However, the CNN model may not be suitable for emotional image data without the images regional features. To solve the difficulty of classifying emotion images, many researchers each year propose a CNN-based architecture suitable for emotion images. Studies on the relationship between color and human emotion were also conducted, and results were derived that different emotions are induced according to color. In studies using deep learning, there have been studies that apply color information to image subtraction classification. The case where the images color information is additionally used than the case where the classification model is trained with only the image improves the accuracy of classifying image emotions.  This study proposes two ways to increase the accuracy by incorporating the result value after the model classifies an images emotion. Both methods improve accuracy by modifying the result value based on statistics using the color of the picture. When performing the test by finding the two-color combinations most distributed for all training data, the two-color combinations most distributed for each test data image were found. The result values were corrected according to the color combination distribution. This method weights the result value obtained after the model classifies an images emotion by creating an expression based on the log function and the exponential function.  Emotion6, classified into six emotions, and Artphoto classified into eight categories were used for the image data. Densenet169, Mnasnet, Resnet101, Resnet152, and Vgg19 architectures were used for the CNN model, and the performance evaluation was compared before and after applying the two-stage learning to the CNN model.  Inspired by color psychology, which deals with the relationship between colors and emotions, when creating a model that classifies an images sentiment, we studied how to improve accuracy by modifying the result values based on color. Sixteen colors were used: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, purple, turquoise, pink, magenta, brown, gray, silver, gold, white, and black. It has meaning. Using Scikit-learns Clustering, the seven colors that are primarily distributed in the image are checked. Then, the RGB coordinate values of the colors from the image are compared with the RGB coordinate values of the 16 colors presented in the above data. That is, it was converted to the closest color. Suppose three or more color combinations are selected. In that case, too many color combinations occur, resulting in a problem in which the distribution is scattered, so a situation fewer influences the result value. Therefore, to solve this problem, two-color combinations were found and weighted to the model. Before training, the most distributed color combinations were found for all training data images. The distribution of color combinations for each class was stored in a Python dictionary format to be used during testing. During the test, the two-color combinations that are most distributed for each test data image are found. After that, we checked how the color combinations were distributed in the training data and corrected the result. We devised several equations to weight the result value from the model based on the extracted color as described above.  The data set was randomly divided by 80:20, and the model was verified using 20% of the data as a test set. After splitting the remaining 80% of the data into five divisions to perform 5-fold cross-validation, the model was trained five times using different verification datasets. Finally, the performance was checked using the test dataset that was previously separated. Adam was used as the activation function, and the learning rate"

The proposed solution in this paper consists of two phases: the process of collecting vehicle location data in a privacy-presering manner and the process of predicting traffic volume using the collected location data. In the first phase, the vehicle’s location data is collected by using LDP to prevent privacy issues that may arise during the data collection process. LDP adds random noise to the original data when collecting data to prevent the data owner’s sensitive information from being exposed to the outside. This allows the collection of vehicle location data, while preserving the driver’s privacy. In the second phase, the traffic volume is predicted by applying deep learning techniques to the data collected in the first stage. Experimental results with real data sets demonstrate that the method proposed in this paper can effectively predict the traffic volume using the location data that are collected in a privacy-preserving manner."

This study first analyzed confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection and government announcements during the second wave of COVID-19 spread and divided the period into five phases. Then, news articles of 12 media companies were collected from online news portals and pre-processed into a 14,011 news corpus. The analysis methods were frequency analysis, keyword co-occurrence network, and Top2Vec modeling that uses deep learning embedding for time-series visualization. As a result, the articles related to “Social Distancing” showed a higher featured news ratio than “COVID-19.” The newspapers had a higher ratio of featured news preference than television. For featured news, the proportion of national, politics, economy sections and phase 1, 2 were higher than other sections and phases. However, the proportion of non-featured news showed more diverse section and increase in fifth phase as social distancing was mitigated to level 1. Regarding keyword network, featured and non-featured news shared many keywords related to the confirmed cases and social distancing policies. Still, keywords in non-featured news showed more diverse topic keywords. We found the keywords related to the confirmed cases and social distancing in whole phases. In terms of unique keywords, each phase reflected conflicts in social distancing and concerns about re-proliferation of COVID-19. For the news sections, information about confirmed cases and social distancing were found in whole sections. However, except for the national section, all sections showed unique keywords linked to conflicts and criticism about social distancing. The embedding topic model indicated an imbalance in the featured and non-featured news among some topics. For featured news topics, conflicts about social distancing and government announcements were found as major issues. For non-featured news, confirmed cases in the local community and various problems related to social distancing comprised major issues. In featured news topics, the social and political sections were influential in the first and second phases, and non-featured news provided more diverse sections and phases. For visualization, topics linked to conflict were concentrated in the first and second phases, and effects of policy changes were mostly found in the fourth and fifth phases. Topics that had lower correlation with social distancing showed irregular patterns. The results suggest that the news companies showed contradictory tendencies in their coverage of social distancing in the second wave of COVID-19, in the portal news environment and “featured news.”"

In this process, the method of evaluating the performance of approximation uses the loss function. Existing in-depth learning methods implement approximation that takes into account loss functions in the linear approximation process, but non-linear approximation phases that use active functions use non-linear transformation that is not related to reduction of loss functions of loss. This study proposes parametric activation functions that introduce scale parameters that can change the scale of activation functions and location parameters that can change the location of activation functions. By introducing parametric activation functions based on scale and location parameters, the performance of nonlinear approximation using activation functions can be improved. The scale and location parameters in each hidden layer can improve the performance of the deep neural network by determining parameters that minimize the loss function value through the learning process using the primary differential coefficient of the loss function for the parameters in the backpropagation. Through MNIST classification problems and XOR problems, parametric activation functions have been found to have superior performance over existing activation functions."

And the unmanned logistics system requires a prerequisite that the pallet position is always in the correct position. However, since not all logistics processes can be automated, there are areas where this assumption does not apply. Various studies have been conducted to implement an unmanned automation system in these environments. Traditional vision-based image processing techniques have a fast processing speed, but there is a weak problem in the disturbance of images. On the other hand, the deep learning technique has a disadvantage in that the object extraction speed is slow due to the large amount of computation. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a method that can measure the exact position of the pallet by verifying the object at high speed while being strong against disturbance by appropriately utilizing the advantages of the two methods."

However, having access to so much information makes it difficult for users to easily find the information they seek. Users want a visualized system that reduces information retrieval and learning time, saving them from personally reading and judging all available information. As a result, recommendation systems are an increasingly important technologies that are essential to the business.  Collaborative filtering is used in various fields with excellent performance because recommendations are made based on similar user interests and preferences. However, limitations do exist. Sparsity occurs when user-item preference information is insufficient, and is the main limitation of collaborative filtering. The evaluation value of the user item matrix may be distorted by the data depending on the popularity of the product, or there may be new users who have not yet evaluated the value. The lack of historical data to identify consumer preferences is referred to as data sparsity, and various methods have been studied to address these problems. However, most attempts to solve the sparsity problem are not optimal because they can only be applied when additional data such as users personal information, social networks, or characteristics of items are included.  Another problem is that real-world score data are mostly biased to high scores, resulting in severe imbalances. One cause of this imbalance distribution is the purchasing bias, in which only users with high product ratings purchase products, so those with low ratings are less likely to purchase products and thus do not leave negative product reviews. Due to these characteristics, unlike most users actual preferences, reviews by users who purchase products are more likely to be positive. Therefore, the actual rating data is over-learned in many classes with high incidence due to its biased characteristics, distorting the market. Applying collaborative filtering to these imbalanced data leads to poor recommendation performance due to excessive learning of biased classes.  Traditional oversampling techniques to address this problem are likely to cause overfitting because they repeat the same data, which acts as noise in learning, reducing recommendation performance. In addition, pre-processing methods for most existing data imbalance problems are designed and used for binary classes. Binary class imbalance techniques are difficult to apply to multi-class problems because they cannot model multi-class problems, such as objects at cross-class boundaries or objects overlapping multiple classes.  To solve this problem, research has been conducted to convert and apply multi-class problems to binary class problems. However, simplification of multi-class problems can cause potential classification errors when combined with the results of classifiers learned from other sub-problems, resulting in loss of important information about relationships beyond the selected items. Therefore, it is necessary to develop more effective methods to address multi-class imbalance problems.  We propose a collaborative filtering model using CGAN to generate realistic virtual data to populate the empty user-item matrix. Conditional vector y identify distributions for minority classes and generate data reflecting their characteristics. Collaborative filtering then maximizes the performance of the recommendation system via hyperparameter tuning. This process should improve the accuracy of the model by addressing the sparsity problem of collaborative filtering implementations while mitigating data imbalances arising from real data. Our model has superior recommendation performance over existing oversampling techniques and existing real-world data with data sparsity.

Malware Detection with Directed Cyclic Graph and Weight Merging,2021,"['malware detection', 'directed cyclic graph', 'Markov Chain', 'machine learning', 'neural network']",,"Malware is a severe threat to the computing system and there’s a long history of the battle between malware detection and anti-detection. Most traditional detection methods are based on static analysis with signature matching and dynamic analysis methods that are focused on sensitive behaviors. However, the usual detections have only limited effect when meeting the development of malware, so that the manual update for feature sets is essential. Besides, most of these methods match target samples with the usual feature database, which ignored the characteristics of the sample itself. In this paper, we propose a new malware detection method that could combine the features of a single sample and the general features of malware. Firstly, a structure of Directed Cyclic Graph (DCG) is adopted to extract features from samples. Then the sensitivity of each API call is computed with Markov Chain. Afterward, the graph is merged with the chain to get the final features. Finally, the detectors based on machine learning or deep learning are devised for identification. To evaluate the effect and robustness of our approach, several experiments were adopted. The results showed that the proposed method had a good performance in most tests, and the approach also had stability with the development and growth of malware."

For the automatic detection and localization of wildfire, semantic segmentation, which is one of the deep learning techniques, is used; the recommendation algorithm of the release point is proposed using the locailization information. After conducting the machine learning, the accuracy on the proposed release point was estimated over 90%, which agrees well with the location proposal of human. It is expected that the algorithm proposed in this study can be utilized for developing fully-automatic system of fire suppression with UAV."

The development of deep learning technology has dramatically improved the performance of image classifiers. However, if the images are contaminated by noise, the performance degrades rapidly. Noise added to the image is inevitably generated in the process of obtaining and transmitting the image. Therefore, in order to use the classifier in a real environment, we have to deal with the noise. On the other hand, the autoencoder is an artificial neural network model that is trained to have similar input and output values. If the input data is similar to the training data, the error between the input data and output data of the autoencoder will be small. However, if the input data is not similar to the training data, the error will be large. The proposed system uses the relationship between the input data and the output data of the autoencoder, and it has two phases to classify the images. In the first phase, the classes with the highest likelihood of classification are selected and subject to the procedure again in the second phase. For the performance analysis of the proposed system, classification accuracy was tested on a Gaussian noise-contaminated MNIST dataset. As a result of the experiment, it was confirmed that the proposed system in the noisy environment has higher accuracy than the CNN-based classification technique."

Recent deep learning algorithms allow objects to be recognized through physical movement, and it is expected that autonomous driving vehicles will be able to understand the actual road conditions more naturally.How should the criminal law regulate autonomous driving vehicles? First of all, Risk criminal law focuses on preemptive measures to future potential risks. However, it will eventually lead to the functionalization or policyization of criminal law. On the other hand, the allowed risk theory makes it possible to take some risks arising in modern industrial societies. In the case of autonomous driving vehicles, the problem is to what extent can our society allow risks from errors in autonomous driving vehicles’ software?Although the 「Act on Promotion and Support of Commercialization of autonomous driving vehicles」 is enacted and implemented in 2019, it focuses on the development of autonomous vehicle technology and the establishment of infrastructure, and there are no regulations on the risks.Therefore, it is necessary to establish the permissible range of autonomous driving vehicle risks to ensure the safety of the people and to establish a legal basis for the preliminary regulation and management of risks exceeding them. ‘Mean Distance Between Failures(MDBF)’ can be used as a quantified basis for determining the safety of autonomous driving vehicles. And I propose to form a public-private cooperation committee with various members to ensure rapid legislative and policy response, and to mandate prior management of manufacturers and regular software inspections by users."

기상 데이터를 활용한 LSTM 기반의 해양 혼합층 수온 예측,2021,"['Temperature', 'Submarine', 'Ocean Mixed Layer', 'Prediction', 'IEODO', 'LSTM', 'Deep-learning']",,"Recently, the surface temperature in the seas around Korea has been continuously rising. This temperature rise causes changes in fishery resources and affects leisure activities such as fishing. In particular, high temperatures lead to the occurrence of red tides, causing severe damage to ocean industries such as aquaculture. Meanwhile, changes in sea temperature are closely related to military operation to detect submarines. This is because the degree of diffraction, refraction, or reflection of sound waves used to detect submarines varies depending on the ocean mixed layer. Currently, research on the prediction of changes in sea water temperature is being actively conducted. However, existing research is focused on predicting only the surface temperature of the ocean, so it is difficult to identify fishery resources according to depth and apply them to military operations such as submarine detection. Therefore, in this study, we predicted the temperature of the ocean mixed layer at a depth of 38m by using temperature data for each water depth in the upper mixed layer and meteorological data such as temperature, atmospheric pressure, and sunlight that are related to the surface temperature. The data used are meteorological data and sea temperature data by water depth observed from 2016 to 2020 at the IEODO Ocean Research Station. In order to increase the accuracy and efficiency of prediction, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), which is known to be suitable for time series data among deep learning techniques, was used. As a result of the experiment, in the daily prediction, the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of the model using temperature, atmospheric pressure, and sunlight data together was 0.473. On the other hand, the RMSE of the model using only the surface temperature was 0.631. These results confirm that the model using meteorological data together shows better performance in predicting the temperature of the upper ocean mixed layer."

DNN-Based Brain MRI Classification Using Fuzzy Clustering and Autoencoder Features,2021,"['Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)', 'Fuzzy c-mean (FCM) clustering', 'Deep neural network', 'Autoencoder', 'Classification']",,"Worldwide interest has been noted in medical image analysis and classification using machine learning techniques. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the safe and painless procedures for human brain scanning. During the MRI procedure, magnetic fields and radio waves are used to scan and map the extended view of brain tissues for further pathological processes and analysis. For a qualitative and quantitative MRI analysis, the manual capability of radiologists and/or doctors is limited and time-consuming in complex and group-level diagnoses. Hence, the development of an intelligent, robust, and reliable support system for the diagnosis of brain-related diseases is a top priority. In this paper, a new deep neural network based MRI image classification approach is proposed that uses fuzzy c-mean (FCM) and an autoencoder to classify brain MRI as normal or abnormal, diminishing human error during the diagnosis of diseases in MRI scans. Here, FCM is utilized for abnormal tissue segmentation from brain MRI images, followed by an autoencoder, for extraction and dimensionality reduction of features. Finally, a deep neural network was used for the classification of brain MRI images that were trained using FCM-extracted features and sample data.

However, link prediction using deep learning has a major limitation as the inferred results cannot be explained. We propose a high-utility knowledge graph prediction model that yields explainable inference paths supporting the inference results. We define paths to the object from the knowledge graph using a path ranking algorithm and define them as the explanation segments. Then, the generated explanation segments are embedded using a Convolutional neural network (CNN) and a Bidirectional Long short-term memory (BiLSTM).

Robust Localization of Unmanned Surface Vehicle Using DDQN-AM,2021,"['DDQN-AM', 'INS/GPS', 'Kalman filter', 'localization', 'nonlinear vehicle', 'USV']",,"A robust localization algorithm has been proposed for an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) using DDQN-AM (Double Deep Q-Network with Action Memory). Inertial Navigation System (INS) and Global Positioning System (GPS) are used for collecting location information and for controlling the USV with DDQN-AM algorithm. Conventional probability-based filters such as Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) are suitable for estimating behaviors of nonlinear systems and have been widely applied for localizing various kinds of nonlinear vehicles. However, the algorithms diverge or linearization position error increases in localizing USVs that are required to follow a desired trajectory accurately under high wave and wind conditions. Also, computational complexity is very high, which causes the instability of the vehicle system. To address these problems, DDQN with Adam optimization for error back propagation have been adopted in this research. However, if learning is performed using the training data set of the current time (current state, reward, action) in the replay buffer of DDQN, the learning performance (accuracy for states and running time) may deteriorate and learning load may occur. therefore, to improve the learning performance of DDQN, DDQN-AM has been newly proposed by adding AM in this research. To verify the effectiveness and to show the superior learning performance of the proposed DDQN-AM against the conventional approaches, a simulation using Matlab and field experiments with a prototype USV have been performed at the seashore. As a result, the position error of DDQN-AM was improved by 57.6% compared to the existing approach, and the average running time was also shortened by 1 minute, 30 seconds."

The image segmentation method had the better performance than the image classification method for mapping the rural roads using the give satellite image, because some of the rural roads mapped by the image classification method were not identified due to the miclassification errors occurred in the object classification map, while all of the rural roads mapped by the image segmentation method were identified.

In addition, through early detection and screening of asympotomatic patients, it can be expected to enhance combat power through early treatment and prevention. In this paper, a study was conducted to diagnose major military medical diseases(pneumonia, tuberculosis, rhabdomyolysis) by using deep learning on military medical data.

However, in line with the changes in the industry, the fields of major subjects by department are diversifying and increasing in number in university education. As a result, students have difficulty to choose and take classes according to their career paths. In general, students choose classes based on experiences such as choices of peers or advice from seniors. This has the advantage of being able to take into account the general situation, but it does not reflect individual tendencies and considerations of existing courses, and has a problem that leads to information inequality that is shared only among specific students. In addition, as non-face-to-face classes have recently been conducted and exchanges between students have decreased, even experience-based decisions have not been made as well. Therefore, this study proposes a recommendation system model that can recommend college major classes suitable for individual characteristics based on data rather than experience. The recommendation system recommends information and content (music, movies, books, images, etc.) that a specific user may be interested in. It is already widely used in services where it is important to consider individual tendencies such as YouTube and Facebook, and you can experience it familiarly in providing personalized services in content services such as over-the-top media services (OTT). Classes are also a kind of content consumption in terms of selecting classes suitable for individuals from a set content list. However, unlike other content consumption, it is characterized by a large influence of selection results. For example, in the case of music and movies, it is usually consumed once and the time required to consume content is short. Therefore, the importance of each item is relatively low, and there is no deep concern in selecting. Major classes usually have a long consumption time because they have to be taken for one semester, and each item has a high importance and requires greater caution in choice because it affects many things such as career and graduation requirements depending on the composition of the selected classes. Depending on the unique characteristics of these major classes, the recommendation system in the education field supports decision-making that reflects individual characteristics that are meaningful and cannot be reflected in experience-based decision-making, even though it has a relatively small number of item ranges. This study aims to realize personalized education and enhance students educational satisfaction by presenting a recommendation model for university major class. In the model study, class history data of undergraduate students at University from 2015 to 2017 were used, and students and their major names were used as metadata. The class history data is implicit feedback data that only indicates whether content is consumed, not reflecting preferences for classes. Therefore, when we derive embedding vectors that characterize students and classes, their expressive power is low. With these issues in mind, this study proposes a Net-NeuMF model that generates vectors of students, classes through network analysis and utilizes them as input values of the model. The model was based on the structure of NeuMF using one-hot vectors, a representative model using data with implicit feedback. The input vectors of the model are generated to represent the characteristic of students and classes through network analysis. To generate a vector representing a student, each student is set to a node and the edge is designed to connect with a weight if the two students take the same class. Similarly, to generate a vector representing the class, each class was set as a node, and the edge connected if any students had taken the classes in common. Thus, we utilize Node2Vec, a representation learning methodology that quantifies the charac"

The state-of-the-art green laser in the visible region (λ = 515 nm) was used as a welding heat source, and the reliability of the bonding interface was analyzed. Remarkable spatter reduction was achieved in the full scan-speed range of 180 - 220 mm/s and output of 800–1200 W. Using a green laser with 40% absorption, we achieved high-quality joining without employing any additional mechanical processes such as weaving, wobble, or oscillation. In the case of an IR laser, we determined that it was sensitive to the state of the surface (e.g., scratched or rough). By contrast, in the case of the green laser, it was relatively insensitive, and a homogeneous bead was formed. Over 98% accuracy was found for the welded parts, and 66% accuracy was observed for the failed welding parts. The welding quality was derived as a deterministic rather than stochastic result, and it was confirmed that image-based deep learning technology was effectively applied and could be used for non-destructive welding quality inspection."

The traditional activation functions, the sigmoid and tanh functions, were compared with the functions which have been recently recommended for deep neural networks; the ReLU, leaky ReLU, and ELU functions. The flood forecasting model based on ANNs was designed to predict real-time runoff for 1 to 6-h lead time using the rainfall and runoff data of the past nine hours. The statistical measures such as R<sup>2</sup>, Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), the error of peak time (ETp), and the error of peak discharge (EQp) were used to evaluate the model accuracy. The tanh and ELU functions were most accurate with R<sup>2</sup>=0.97 and RMSE=30.1 (m<sup>3</sup>/s) for 1-h lead time and R<sup>2</sup>=0.56 and RMSE=124.6∼124.8 (m<sup>3</sup>/s) for 6-h lead time. We also evaluated the learning speed by using the number of epochs that minimizes errors. The sigmoid function had the slowest learning speed due to the ‘vanishing gradient problem’ and the limited direction of weight update. The learning speed of the ELU function was 1.2 times faster than the tanh function. As a result, the ELU function most effectively improved the accuracy and speed of the ANNs model, so it was determined to be the best activation function for ANNs-based flood forecasting."

In this paper, using a single camera image, fast object detection was performed using the YOLOv5 algorithm, a deep learning algorithm, and fast estimation of the speed of the object was performed by using a local dense optical flow modified from the existing dense optical flow based on the detected object. Based on this algorithm, we present a system that can predict the collision time and probability, and through this system, we intend to contribute to prevent tram accidents."

On the other hand, deep learning models still work as a black box that makes interpreting the output a challenge. Diagnosis based on images is currently a trend that plays a key role in clinical treatment by discovering abnormal regions for disease diagnosis.

Through this, national consensus was formed and the group's belief system in favor of introducing telemedicine was strengthened. This dynamic movement of the policy subsystem led to the emergence of the National Assembly as a policy broker, and policy changes had occurred when National Assembly revised the Infectious Disease Prevention Act in 2020.Unlike before, when science policies were considered a specialized area and unilaterally introduced by political decisions or political leaders, the introduction of new technologies and new services required support from members of society through consensus with the people.

License plate data needs to be balanced from past license plates to the latest license plates. However, it is difficult to obtain data from the actual past license plate to the latest ones. In order to solve this problem, a license plate recognition study through deep learning is being conducted by creating a synthetic license plates. Since the synthetic data have differences from real data, and various data augmentation techniques are used to solve these problems. Existing data augmentation simply used methods such as brightness, rotation, affine transformation, blur, and noise. In this paper, we apply a style transformation method that transforms synthetic data into real-world data styles with data augmentation methods. In addition, real license plate data are noisy when it is captured from a distance and under the dark environment. If we simply recognize characters with input data, chances of misrecognition are high. To improve character recognition, in this paper, we applied the DeblurGANv2 method as a quality improvement method for character recognition, increasing the accuracy of license plate recognition. The method of deep learning for license plate detection and license plate number recognition used YOLO-V5. To determine the performance of the synthetic license plate data, we construct a test set by collecting our own secured license plates. License plate detection without style conversion recorded 0.614 mAP. As a result of applying the style transformation, we confirm that the license plate detection performance was improved by recording 0.679mAP. In addition, the successul detection rate without image enhancement was 0.872, and the detection rate was 0.915 after image enhancement, confirming that the performance improved."
A Feature Inherited Hierarchical Convolutional Neural Network (FI-HCNN) for Motor Fault Severity Estimation Using Stator Current Signals,2021,['Severity estimation · Fault diagnosis · Motor current signature analysis · Hierarchical network · Induction motor · Convolutional neural network'],,"Motors, which are one of the most widely used machines in the manufacturing field, take charge of a key role in precision machining. Therefore, it is important to accurately estimate the health state of the motor that affects the quality of the product. The research outlined in this paper aims to improve motor fault severity estimation by suggesting a novel deep learning method, specifically, feature inherited hierarchical convolutional neural network (FI-HCNN). FI-HCNN consists of a fault diagnosis part and a severity estimation part, arranged hierarchically. The main novelty of the proposed FI-HCNN is the special inherited structure between the hierarchy; the severity estimation part utilizes the latent features to exploit the fault-related representations in the fault diagnosis task. FI-HCNN can improve the accuracy of the fault severity estimation because the level-specific abstraction is supported by the latent features. Also, FI-HCNN has ease in practical application because it is developed based on stator current signals which are usually acquired for a control purpose. Experimental studies of mechanical motor faults, including eccentricity, broken rotor bars, and unbalanced conditions, are used to corroborate the high performance of FI-HCNN, as compared to both conventional methods and other hierarchical deep learning methods."

Medical imaging is rapidly taking a predominant position for the diagnosis and treatment of lower back abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a primary tool for detecting anatomical and functional abnormalities in the intervertebral disc (IVD) and provides valuable data for both diagnosis and research. Deep learning methods perform well in computer visioning when labeled general image training data are abundant. In the practice of medical images, the labeled data or the segmentation data are produced manually. However, manual medical image segmentation leads to two main issues: much time is needed for delineation, and reproducibility is called into question. To handle this problem, we developed an automated approach for IVD instance segmentation that can utilize T1 and T2 images during this study to handle data limitation problems and computational time problems and improve the generalization of the algorithm. This method builds upon mask-RCNN; we proposed a multistage optimization mask-RCNN (MOM-RCNN) for deep learning segmentation networks. We used a multi-optimization training system by utilizing stochastic gradient descent and adaptive moment estimation (Adam) with T1 and T2 in MOM-RCNN. The proposed method showed a significant improvement in processing time and segmentation results compared to previous commonly used segmentation methods. We evaluated the results using several different key performance measures. We obtain the Dice coefficient (99%). Our method can define the IVD’s segmentation as much as 88% (sensitivity) and recognize the non-IVD as much as 98% (specificity). The results also obtained increasing precision (92%) with a low global consistency error (0.03), approaching 0 (the best possible score). On the spatial distance measures, the results show a promising reduction from 0.407 ± 0.067 mm in root mean square error to 0.095 ± 0.026 mm, Hausdorff distance from 12.313 ± 3.015 to 5.155 ± 1.561 mm, and average symmetric surface distance from 1.944 ± 0.850 to 0.49 ± 0.23 mm compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

실시간 이미지 처리 방법을 이용한 개선된 차선 인식 경로 추종 알고리즘 개발,2021,,,"In this study, improved path tracking control algorithm based on pure pursuit algorithm is newly proposed by using improved lane detection algorithm through real time post-processing with interpolation methodology. Since the original pure pursuit works well only at speeds below 20 km/h, the look-ahead distance is implemented as a sigmoid function to work well at an average speed of 45 km/h to improve tracking performance. In addition, a smoothing filter was added to reduce the steering angle vibration of the original algorithm, and the stability of the steering angle was improved. The post-processing algorithm presented has implemented more robust lane recognition system using real-time pre/post processing method with deep learning and estimated interpolation. Real time processing is more cost-effective than the method using lots of computing resources and building abundant datasets for improving the performance of deep learning networks. Therefore, this paper also presents improved lane detection performance by using the final results with naive computer vision codes and pre/post processing. Firstly, the pre-processing was newly designed for real-time processing and robust recognition performance of augmentation. Secondly, the post-processing was designed to detect lanes by receiving the segmentation results based on the estimated interpolation in consideration of the properties of the continuous lanes. Consequently, experimental results by utilizing driving guidance line information from processing parts show that the improved lane detection algorithm is effective to minimize the lateral offset error in the diverse maneuvering roads."

Therefore, in this study, we examine the visualization approach for each process through the analysis of preceding studies that visualize the execution process of artificial intelligence. Methods:  In this study, machine learning and deep learning pipelines in general predictive modeling projects were examined and the papers applied to them were examined, and the process of performing artificial intelligence was divided into three stages (Collection, Learning, Inference).

In an experiment, we show that automatic labeling can greatly improve the productivity of datasets especially reducing time and efforts to specify regions of objects found in images. Finally, we discuss critical issues that we faced in the experiment to our annotation system and describe future work to raise the productivity of image datasets creation for accelerating AI technology."

The proposed technique has the following originality. The first is to extract feature points and use them to generate local patches to enable faster computation by learning and using only local patches that are more useful than the surroundings without learning the entire image. Second, learning is performed through deep learning using the convolution neural network structure to improve accuracy by reducing the error rate. Third, unlike the existing feature point matching technique, it enables indoor location measurement including left and right movement. Fourth, since the indoor location is newly measured every frame, errors occurring in the front side during movement are prevented from accumulating. Therefore, it has the advantage that the error between the final arrival point and the predicted indoor location does not increase even if the moving distance increases. As a result of the experiment conducted to evaluate the time required and accuracy of the measurement technique of indoor location based on markerless applicable to AR proposed in this paper, the difference between the actual indoor location and the measured indoor location is an average of 12.8㎝ and a maximum of 21.2㎝. As measured, the indoor location measurement accuracy was better than that of the existing IEEE paper. In addition, it was determined that it was possible to measure the user’s indoor location in real time by displaying the measured result at 20 frames per second."

The most problematic aspect of such artificial intelligence is the black box problem, which is that humans do not properly understand the mechanism of operation of artificial intelligence. The inner workings of deep learning or machine learning architectures are becoming increasingly complex and opaque. As is the case in other fields, in the field of law, a system is essential to ensure transparency in the decision-making process of artificial intelligence, and to explain the decision-making process to non-experts. Decision-making in the field of law is because not only the outcome, but also its procedural justification is very important. The recidivism risk prediction algorithm COMPAS, which is mentioned as a representative case of decision-making algorithms in the legal field, is used for determining whether to release a defendant or determining a sentence. Since the introduction and implementation of COMPAS, as seen in the controversy and criticisms surrounding this algorithm, COMPAS, which is widely used in the United States, has been found to have many problems, such as racist results. Due to the black box nature of artificial intelligence, we do not know the mechanism of COMPAS. Even those who have suffered damage due to the biased result cannot challenge the result because of the black box property. There is a need for a solution to solve the problem of artificial intelligence algorithms caused by such black boxes. The biggest stem of the solution is ‘explainable artificial intelligence'. Explainable artificial intelligence refers to artificial intelligence that presents the reasons for decisions made by artificial intelligence in a way that humans can understand. The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa), which is considered to have made a significant contribution to the advancement of artificial intelligence, began to provide enormous support for such explanatory artificial intelligence research several years ago.Of course, some of the AI researchers are questioning the value of explainable AI. Even the human decision-making process cannot be explained easily, and they question both the explanatory feasibility and practicality of the decision-making process of artificial intelligence. Despite this skepticism, in order to develop and establish an artificial intelligence algorithm at a level that replaces human decision-making in the field of law, an explainable AI task must be solved. Therefore, in this study, the concept of explainable artificial intelligence and how important it is to the implementation and application of artificial intelligence algorithms in the legal field, and its feasibility are examined.It is expected that a large number of problems that hinder fairness values such as bias and discrimination will be solved by such explainable artificial intelligence. Apart from that, I would like to discuss with you whether there is a way to solve the problem of impairing fairness value caused by artificial intelligence algorithms."

Hence, multispectral MRI modalities are used for characterizingthe properties of brain tissues. Traditional lesion detection methods rely on extracting significant hand-engineeredfeatures to differentiate normal and abnormal brain tissues. But the identification of those discriminating features is quitecomplex, as the degree of differentiation varies according to each modality. This can be addressed well by ConvolutionalNeural Networks (CNN) which supports automatic feature extraction. It is capable of learning the global features from imageseffectively for image classification. But it loses the context of local information among the pixels that need to be retained forsegmentation. Also, it must provide more emphasis on the features of the lesion region for precise reconstruction. The majorcontribution of this work is the integration of attention mechanism with a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) to segmentischemic lesion. This attention model is applied to learn and concentrate only on salient features of the lesion region bysuppressing the details of other regions. Hence the proposed FCN with attention mechanism was able to segment ischemiclesion of varying size and shape. To study the effectiveness of attention mechanism, various experiments were carried outon ISLES 2015 dataset and a mean dice coefficient of 0.7535 was obtained. Experimental results indicate that there is animprovement of 5% compared to the existing works."

High-precision wind power forecasting provides a reliable basis for dispatching of power system. Since wind power data is time series data with uncertainty, a suitable model, the LSTM algorithm of Keras, was proposed to predict a short-term wind power generation. The LSTM has memory to store past states, so it is suitable for the problem of predicting time series data. This paper proposes a forecasting procedure using an LSTM neural network to forecast wind power. First, Pearson correlation coefficient method is utilized to determine the parameters of LSTM forecasting model. Then a case study was performed using real data collected from a wind farm in Yeongheung to confirm that the LSTM model was suitable for wind power prediction."

Overseas artificial intelligence chatbots aimed at relieving negative emotions or taking care of mental health care, have increased in use due to the pandemic. In Korea, Psychological diagnosis chatbots similar to those of overseas cases are being operated. However, as the domestic chatbot is a system that outputs a button-based answer rather than a text input-based answer, when compared to overseas chatbots, domestic chatbots remain at a low level of diagnosing human psychology. Therefore, we proposed a chatbot that helps mitigating negative emotions through BERGPT-chatbot. Finally, we compared BERGPT-chatbot and KoGPT2-chatbot through ‘Perplexity’, an internal evaluation metric for evaluating language models, and showed the superity of BERGPT-chatbot."
Effects of Pooling Operations on Prediction of Ligand Rotation- Dependent Protein–Ligand Binding in 3D Graph Convolutional Network,2021,"['Deep learning', '3D graph convolutional network', 'Ligand rotation', 'Pooling operation', 'Protein– ligand binding']",,"3D graph convolutional network (3DGCN) is a graph neural network (GNN) variant that utilizes the 3D bond information on molecules for chemical tasks. In 3DGCN, the pooling operation extracts the molecular features from the atomic features for molecule embedding and dimensionality reduction. In this work, we investigated the pooling effects on the performance of 3DGCN in the classification of protein–ligand binding events, especially when a ligand is rotated with respect to a target protein in the 3D Cartesian coordinate. 3DGCN showed the general ability for recognizing the ligand rotation, and its prediction accuracy was found to be pooling-dependent. For example, 3DGCN with max pooling did not recognize the rotations of known active ligands for human β-secretase 1 faithfully, compared with the other pooling operations (sum, avg, and set2set). This work would contribute to augmented architecture evolution of 3DGCN for the chemical tasks that require the 3D molecular information including chirality."

Despite their great performances, SR techniques tend to focus on a certain upscale factor when training a particular model. Algorithms for single model multi-scale networks can easily be constructed if images are upscaled prior to input, but sub-pixel convolution upsampling works differently for each scale factor. Recent SR methods employ multi-scale and multi-path learning as a solution. However, this causes unshared parameters and unbalanced parameter distribution across various scale factors. We present a multi-scale single-path upsample module as a solution by exploiting the advantages of sub-pixel convolution and interpolation algorithms. The proposed model employs sub-pixel convolution for the highest scale factor among the learning upscale factors, and then utilize 1-dimension interpolation, compressing the learned features on the channel axis to match the desired output image size. Experiments are performed for the single-path upsample module, and compared to the multi-path upsample module. Based on the experimental results, the proposed algorithm reduces the upsample module's parameters by 24% and presents slightly to better performance compared to the previous algorithm."

Filters generated through texture analysis of images are applied to perturbations generated by conventional attack methods. The application of perturbations with relatively high strength in areas with complex textures and weak intensity in low places reduces the recognition of perturbations.

Considering that echocardiography often is affected by inter-observer variability and shows a strong dependence on the level of experience, AI could be extremely advantageous in minimizing observer variation and providing reproducible measures, enabling accurate diagnosis. Currently, most reported AI applications in echocardiographic measurement have focused on improved image acquisition and automation of repetitive and tedious tasks; however, the role of AI applications should not be limited to conventional processes. Rather, AI could provide clinically important insights from subtle and non-specific data, such as changes in myocardial texture in patients with myocardial disease. Recent initiatives to develop large echocardiographic databases can facilitate development of AI applications. The ultimate goal of applying AI to echocardiography is automation of the entire process of echocardiogram analysis. Once automatic analysis becomes reliable, workflows in clinical echocardiographic will change radically.

In this paper, we propose an abstractive document summarization method by applying guidance signals of key sentences to the encoder based on the hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture, denoted as KI-HABS. Specifically, we first train an extractor to extract key sentences in the input document by the hierarchical bidirectional GRU. Then, we encode the key sentences to the key information representation in the sentence level. Finally, we adopt key information representation guided selective encoding strategies to filter source information, which establishes a connection between the key sentences and the document. We use the CNN/Daily Mail and Gigaword datasets to evaluate our model.

This dataset is provided in a form that can be easily used by users familiar with existing two-dimensional image datasets, and it contains various weather and light conditions collected from a complex and diverse practical setting. An incremental and suggestive annotation routine is proposed to improve annotation efficiency. A model is trained to simultaneously predict segmentation labels and suggest class-representative frames. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm yields a more efficient dataset than uniformly sampled datasets."

The object tracking algorithm based on the Siamese network tracks the object by finding the most similar part in the search image using only the target image specified in the first frame of the sequence. Since only the object of the first frame and the search image compare similarity, if tracking fails once, errors accumulate and drift in a part other than the tracked object occurs. Therefore, by designing a CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) based model, we check whether the tracking is progressing well, and the target image exchange timing is defined by using the score output from the Siamese network-based object tracking algorithm. The proposed model is evaluated the performance using the VOT-2018 dataset, and finally achieved an accuracy of 0.611 and a robustness of 22.816."

AANet: Adjacency auxiliary network for salient object detection,2021,"['Salient Object Detection', 'Deep Learning', 'Convolutional Neural Network', 'Multi-scale Information', 'Multi-level Feature Fusion']",,"At present, deep convolution network-based salient object detection (SOD) has achieved impressive performance. However, it is still a challenging problem to make full use of the multi-scale information of the extracted features and which appropriate feature fusion method is adopted to process feature mapping. In this paper, we propose a new adjacency auxiliary network (AANet) based on multi-scale feature fusion for SOD. Firstly, we design the parallel connection feature enhancement module (PFEM) for each layer of feature extraction, which improves the feature density by connecting different dilated convolution branches in parallel, and add channel attention flow to fully extract the context information of features. Then the adjacent layer features with close degree of abstraction but different characteristic properties are fused through the adjacent auxiliary module (AAM) to eliminate the ambiguity and noise of the features. Besides, in order to refine the features effectively to get more accurate object boundaries, we design adjacency decoder (AAM_D) based on adjacency auxiliary module (AAM), which concatenates the features of adjacent layers, extracts their spatial attention, and then combines them with the output of AAM. The outputs of AAM_D features with semantic information and spatial detail obtained from each feature are used as salient prediction maps for multi-level feature joint supervising. Experiment results on six benchmark SOD datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms similar previous methods."

In this paper, IDS is given based on an innovative optimized custom RC-NN (Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network) which is proposed for intrusion detection along with the Ant Lion optimization algorithm. By this method, CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is made hybrid with LSTM (Long Short Term Memory). Thus, all the attacks identified with the network layer of cloud are classified efficiently.

This attention is based on the fact that in a smart factory environment where operating processes, such as facility control, data collection, and decision making are automated, the disruption of processes due to problems such as facility anomalies causes considerable losses. Although many studies have considered methods to prevent such losses, few have investigated how to effectively apply the solutions. This study proposes a Kubernetes based system applied in a smart factoryproviding effective operation and facility management. To develop the system, we employed a useful and popular open source project, and adopted deep learning based anomaly detection model for multi-sensor anomaly detection. This can be easily modified without interruption by changing the container image for inference.

LSTM Prediction of Streamflow during Peak Rainfall of Piney River,2021,"['Flood management', 'Disaster mitigation', 'Deep learning', 'Streamflow', 'LSTM']",,"Streamflow prediction is a very vital disaster mitigation approach for effective flood management and water resources planning. Lately, torrential rainfall caused by climate change has been reported to have increased globally, thereby causing enormous infrastructural loss, properties and lives. This study evaluates the contribution of rainfall to streamflow prediction in normal and peak rainfall scenarios, typical of the recent flood at Piney Resort in Vernon, Hickman County, Tennessee, United States. Daily streamflow, water level, and rainfall data for 20 years (2000-2019) from two USGS gage stations (03602500 upstream and 03599500 downstream) of the Piney River watershed were obtained, preprocesssed and fitted with Long short term memory (LSTM) model. Tensorflow and Keras machine learning frameworks were used with Python to predict streamflow values with a sequence size of 14 days, to determine whether the model could have predicted the flooding event in August 21, 2021. Model skill analysis showed that LSTM model with full data (water level, streamflow and rainfall) performed better than the Naive Model except some rainfall models, indicating that only rainfall is insufficient for streamflow prediction. The final LSTM model recorded optimal NSE and RMSE values of 0.68 and 13.84 m3 /s and predicted peak flow with the lowest prediction error of 11.6%, indicating that the final model could have predicted the flood on August 24, 2021 given a peak rainfall scenario. Adequate knowledge of rainfall patterns will guide hydrologists and disaster prevention managers in designing efficient early warning systems and policies aimed at mitigating flood risks"

폭우 환경에서의 의미적 시각 특징 정합 기반의 이미지 캡셔닝,2021,"['image captioning', 'rain removal', 'deep learning']",,"Image captioning methods for generating sentences from input images are being developed for high-quality images captured in clear weather. However, in bad weather conditions such as heavy rain, heavy snow, and fog, the quality of the captured images deteriorates due to poor visibility, rain and snow artifacts. This hinders the extraction of useful features of the object and causes the performance of image captioning to deteriorate. To overcome this problem, this study proposes an image captioning method that can generate accurate sentences even in heavy rain conditions. First, an image quality improvement network based on physical heavy rain modeling is presented, and then the image quality of heavy rain images is restored through the reverse process of physical heavy rain modeling. In addition, an encoder capable of matching visual feature vectors between the restored image and the original image is proposed, and the semantic visual feature expression power of the restored image is improved. Through experiments, it is confirmed that the proposed image captioning method can increase the accuracy of sentence generation in a heavy rain condition, compared to the existing image captioning method."
Object Tracking with Histogram weighted Centroid augmented Siamese Region Proposal Network,2021,"['Siamese network', 'Histogram', 'Deep learning', 'Object Tracking']",,"In this paper, we propose an histogram weighted centroid based Siamese region proposal network for object tracking. The original Siamese region proposal network uses two identical artificial neural networks which take two different images as the inputs and decide whether the same object exist in both input images based on a similarity measure. However, as the Siamese network is pre-trained offline, it experiences many difficulties in the adaptation to various online environments. Therefore, in this paper we propose to incorporate the histogram weighted centroid feature into the Siamese network method to enhance the accuracy of the object tracking. The proposed method uses both the histogram information and the weighted centroid location of the top 10 color regions to decide which of the proposed region should become the next predicted object region."

Through experiments, we conclude that a feature-classifier model is still better than an end-to-end model. The recommended model uses a spectrogram as the input plane and the classifier is an 18-layer convolutional neural network (CNN). With this arrangement, when compared with existing literature, the proposed model improves the accuracy from 91.8% to 94.1% in Jamendo dataset. As the dataset has an accuracy of more than 90%, the improvement of 2.3% is difficult and valuable. If even higher accuracy is required, the ensemble learning may be used. The recommend setting is a majority vote with seven proposed models. Doing so, the accuracy increases by about 1.1% in Jamendo dataset."

A data-driven event generator for Hadron Colliders using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network,2021,['HEP data · Event generation · Deep learning · GAN · WGAN'],,"Highly reliable Monte-Carlo event generators and detector simulation programs are important for the precision measurement in the high energy physics. Huge amounts of computing resources are required to produce a sufficient number of simulated events. Moreover, simulation parameters have to be fine-tuned to reproduce situations in the high-energy particle interactions which is not trivial in some phase spaces in physics interests. In this paper, we suggest a new method based on the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) that can learn the probability distribution of the real data. Our method is capable of event generation at a very short computing time compared to the traditional MC generators. The trained WGAN is able to reproduce the shape of the real data with high fidelity."

DGAN is derived from the Generative adversarial network (GAN) with the addition of an inverted generative network structure. DGAN not only augments input data but also yields the corresponding design variable data for the augmented data. Assuming a product of an analogous domain was designed in advance, its performance data is utilized with DGAN in order to adapt to a new design domain and to bring out a design that attains similar performance. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is investigated with problems designed to incorporate equations and simulation models."
Optimal Design of Convolutional Neural Network for EEG-based Authentication,2021,"['EEG', 'Authentication', 'Bayesian optimization', 'Deep learning']",,"An electroencephalogram (EEG) is an electrical recording from the scalp when neurons in the brain are active. EEG signals have been studied for authentication because they are difficult to falsify and can distinguish individuals. On the other hand, EEG is nonstationary, and its patterns vary slightly. The authentication model was trained day-to-day to overcome the nonstationarity of EEG. EEG signals were measured on two-channel frontal electrodes for five days from 10 subjects in their resting states. Convolutional neural networks were designed for an EEG-based authentication system, and the model was optimized using a Bayesian optimization method. The proposed neural network model was trained with the EEG data from the first to the fourth day and tested using the fifth-day data, which yielded a mean accuracy of 93.23%, precision of 71.31%, and recall of 57.65%. The incremental learning of the EEG signals day-to-day improves the authentication performance, including various EEG patterns in the model."

Gastroscopy is being performed for early detection of gastric cancer, and this paper proposes Computer-aided Diagnostics(CADx) system that can help gastroscopy.

Due to the nature of medical images, data augmentation was used to solve the lack of data and overfitting could occur. The data augmentation methods used were AutoAugment and Variational AutoEncoder(VAE). AutoAugment is a data augmentation method using color changes, shear, rotation, etc., and VAE learns to standardize the probability distribution of the data, helping to generate data similar to the original data to capture features. The data augmentation method with the best performance is the augmentation method through VAE, and the recall showed 94.84% of the performance.

Proximal Policy Optimization-based Join Order Optimization with Spark SQL,2021,"['Join order optimization', 'Deep reinforcement learning', 'Spark SQL']",,"In a smart grid, massive amounts of data are generated during the production, transmission, and consumption of electricity. Often, complex and varied queries with multiple join and selection operations need to be run on such data. Several studies have focused on improving the performance of query evaluation by applying machine learning techniques to query optimization problems. However, these studies are limited to processing queries for data in a single environment. In this paper, we propose a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based join order optimization model for use on Spark SQL to improve the retrieval performance for large amounts of data. The model uses the cost computation method of Spark SQL for training with the costs of the join plans generated by the model as rewards. The model can find more join plans with lower costs than the plans that Spark SQL finds because Spark SQL is limited to a low search space. We demonstrate that the proposed model generates join plans with similar or lower costs than Spark SQL without executing the optimization algorithm of Spark SQL."

Study on Real-Time Porosity Defect Detection Through Neural Network Structure Optimization using Genetic Algorithm in GMAW,2021,"['Gas metal arc welding', 'Genetic algorithm', 'Deep neural network', 'Hyper parameter optimization']",,"Zinc-coated steel sheets are widely applied as automotive chassis parts because they have high corrosion resistance and good compatibility. However, in the gas metal arc welding (GMAW) process, serious porosity defects occur due to zinc vapor generated during welding, which causes problems such as durability or productivity reduction in the welded structure. To secure weldability and productivity, it is essential to secure monitoring technology that determines whether porosity defects are generated in real-time. To solve this problem, this study provides a method of extracting feature variables from arc voltage signals generated during welding and optimizing the hyper parameters of the porosity detection algorithm deep neural network (DNN) which be learned with feature variables by applying genetic algorithm (GA).

강수-일유출량 추정 LSTM 모형의 구축을 위한 자료 수집 방안,2021,['-'],,"In this study, after developing an LSTM-based deep learning model for estimating daily runoff in the Soyang River Dam basin, the accuracy of the model for various combinations of model structure and input data was investigated. A model was built based on the database consisting of average daily precipitation, average daily temperature, average daily wind speed (input up to here), and daily average flow rate (output) during the first 12 years (1997.1.1-2008.12.31). The Nash-Sutcliffe Model Efficiency Coefficient (NSE) and RMSE were examined for validation using the flow discharge data of the later 12 years (2009.1.1-2020.12.31). The combination that showed the highest accuracy was the case in which all possible input data (12 years of daily precipitation, weather temperature, wind speed) were used on the LSTM model structure with 64 hidden units. The NSE and RMSE of the verification period were 0.862 and 76.8 m<sup>3</sup>/s, respectively. When the number of hidden units of LSTM exceeds 500, the performance degradation of the model due to overfitting begins to appear, and when the number of hidden units exceeds 1000, the overfitting problem becomes prominent. A model with very high performance (NSE=0.8~0.84) could be obtained when only 12 years of daily precipitation was used for model training. A model with reasonably high performance (NSE=0.63-0.85) when only one year of input data was used for model training. In particular, an accurate model (NSE=0.85) could be obtained if the one year of training data contains a wide magnitude of flow events such as extreme flow and droughts as well as normal events. If the training data includes both the normal and extreme flow rates, input data that is longer than 5 years did not significantly improve the model performance."

The higher layer in the network can extract a lot of object information. The lower layer has many location information.

As a result of the experiment, the average center error rate was less than 25%."
Microbial source tracking using metagenomics and other new technologies,2021,"['fecal pollution', 'microbial source tracking', 'metagenomics', 'machine learning', 'next generation sequencing']",,"The environment is under siege from a variety of pollution sources. Fecal pollution is especially harmful as it disperses pathogenic bacteria into waterways. Unraveling origins of mixed sources of fecal bacteria is difficult and microbial source tracking (MST) in complex environments is still a daunting task. Despite the challenges, the need for answers far outweighs the difficulties experienced. Advancements in qPCR and next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have shifted the traditional culture-based MST approaches towards culture independent technologies, where communitybased MST is becoming a method of choice. Metagenomic tools may be useful to overcome some of the limitations of community-based MST methods as they can give deep insight into identifying host specific fecal markers and their association with different environments. Adoption of machine learning (ML) algorithms, along with the metagenomic based MST approaches, will also provide a statistically robust and automated platform. To compliment that, ML-based approaches provide accurate optimization of resources. With the successful application of ML based models in disease prediction, outbreak investigation and medicine prescription, it would be possible that these methods would serve as a better surrogate of traditional MST approaches in future."

To this end, the traditional edge detection methods consist of a structure in which an encoder and a decoder are densely connected. However, content leak in an image occurs through pooling and convolution of encoding. In this paper, we propose an edge detection method based on GLOW to solve the problem. As GLOW consists of reversible functions, reducing content leak in an image. In order to evaluate the proposed method, BSDS500 dataset and BIPED dataset were respectively trained and comparatively analyzed. The experimental results showed that the proposed method detected reasonable edges in images. Furthermore, it was confirmed that when the proposed method was applied to a painting work image, which is a domain other than a photographic image, the proposed method detected edges more precisely than the existing method."

However, since the motion is captured through a camera, the motion expressed as a time series of two-dimensional joint coordinates in a video also changes if the camera angle is varied. If this factor is not taken into account when measuring motion similarity, the machine will not be able to determine motions with different camera angles as the same motion. In this study, in order to improve the similarity measurement performance in this situation, an auto-encoder based model that generates motion embedding independent of the camera angle factor was utilized. Furthermore, through the proposed algorithm that can measure the similarity from the generated motion embedding, it is possible to measure the motion similarity regardless of the camera angle. The experiment was conducted with two-dimensional joint coordinates of motions projecting from various angles and showed more accurate results than the similarity measured by motion embedding generated from a model that did not consider the camera angle."

The CKFont model is an end-to-end Hangul generation model based on GAN, and it can generate all Hangul in various styles with 28 characters and components of first, middle, and final components of Hangul characters. By acquiring local style information from components, the information is more accurate than global information acquisition, and the result of style conversion improves as it can reduce information loss. This is a model that uses the minimum number of characters among known models, and it is an efficient model that reduces style conversion failures, has a concise structure, and saves time and resources.

Point clouds created with RGB images and Depth Map perform downsampling for smooth communication between mobile and server. Point clouds sent to the server are used for 3D object detection. The detection process determines the class of objects and uses one point in the 3D bounding box as an anchor point. AR contents are provided through app and web through class and anchor of the detected object."
RAVIP: Real-Time AI Vision Platform for Heterogeneous Multi-Channel Video Stream,2021,"['Multi-Channel', 'Multi-Stream', 'Object Detection', 'Surveillance Systems', 'Vision']",,"Object detection techniques based on deep learning such as YOLO have high detection performance and precision in a single channel video stream. In order to expand to multiple channel object detection in real-time, however, high-performance hardware is required. In this paper, we propose a novel back-end server framework, a real-time AI vision platform (RAVIP), which can extend the object detection function from single channel to simultaneous multi-channels, which can work well even in low-end server hardware. RAVIP assembles appropriate component modules from the RODEM (real-time object detection module) Base to create perchannel instances for each channel, enabling efficient parallelization of object detection instances on limited hardware resources through continuous monitoring with respect to resource utilization. Through practical experiments, RAVIP shows that it is possible to optimize CPU, GPU, and memory utilization while performing object detection service in a multi-channel situation. In addition, it has been proven that RAVIP can provide object detection services with 25 FPS for all 16 channels at the same time."

In this regard, science and technology have introduced remarkable achievements. Meanwhile, architects and artists have been fascinated by the beauty and wonder of nature, which builds on their engineering understanding and technical knowledge. For architects and artists who have focused on improving the value and quality of human life, nature has been a constant source of creativity. Cutting-edge science and technology to understand and utilize nature was not an earnest desire for architects and artists. However, architects and artists are increasingly inclined to apply scientific and technological approaches amid the strong wave of consilience and convergence. In addition, owing to a user-friendly computing environment and accessible software, the barriers to cutting-edge technology have become very low, leading young architects and artists to adapt natural algorithms for their work. Therefore, as one of the architects and designers of the era, I would like to describe a methodology of design and production for art installations or buildings, with a thorough understanding of specific natural phenomena. (Method) Recent precedents clearly show that natural phenomena have been researched and adapted to various art installations or architectural projects in three major steps: 1) In-depth understanding of natural phenomena; 2) Translation into digital models using parametric design tools; and 3) Application to a physical model. One of the well-known natural phenomena, a diffusion limited aggregation system, is examined in this study, and it is converted into a digital model using a parametric design tool and Visual Basic. The digital model is reconfigured to fit into a specific site’s context. As such, this study proposes a conceptual framework and practical workflow of any nature-inspired art installation project. (Results) The diffusion limited aggregation was researched and the algorithm was broken down into chunks of code blocks in Visual Basic before being converted into a digital model through a parametric design tool. Next, it was modified and updated to fit the actual site’s context. The process proposed herein is a good example of visualizing nature’s algorithm by materializing invisible particles floating in the air. (Conclusions) As described above, in this study, a digital model was created based on a deep understanding of nature’s algorithm rather than a superficial understanding or by attempting to mimic natural phenomena. To materialize or visualize this, an installation was proposed on a site by reconfiguring the digital model in light of its specific context. This process showed that a deep understanding of natural phenomena can provide a new method of designing, planning, and constructing workflow, which is difficult to create using the existing processes."

Therefore, this paper studies the fusion of the two most important modes in emotional recognition (voice and visual expression), and proposes a two-mode dual-modal emotion recognition method combined with the attention mechanism of the improved AlexNet network. After a simple preprocessing of the audio signal and the video signal, respectively, the first step is to use the prior knowledge to realize the extraction of audio characteristics.

This paper proposed an end-to-end hybrid regression model, called Ensemble of Spatial-Temporal Attention Network and Multi-Layer Perceptron (E-STAN-MLP), to forecast surface temperature, humidity, wind speed, and wind direction at 24 automatic weather stations in Beijing. Combining the data from historical observations with the data from the numerical weather prediction (NWP) system, our proposed model give better results than the NWP system or previously reported algorithms. Our E-STAN-MLP model consists of two parts. One is to use the spatial-temporal attention based recurrent neural network to model the time series of meteorological elements. The other is a simple but efficient multilayer perceptron architecture forecasts the regression value while ignoring time dependence. Results at each time stamp are integrated together using a step-wise fusion strategy. Moreover, we use a joint loss step integrating both the regression loss function and the classification loss function to simultaneously forecast the wind speed and direction. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed E-STAN-MLP model achieves state-of-the-art results in weather forecasting."

Empirical results demonstrated that a model had minimum losses obtain by Adagrad optimizer in the case of 16 batch sizes and 50 epochs. In addition, the SGD with a 32 batch sizes and 150 epochs and the Adam with a 64 batch sizes and 50 epochs had the best performance based on the loss value during the training process. Interestingly, the accuracy was higher while performing the Adagrad and Adamax optimizer with a 120 batch sizes and 150 epochs. In this study, the Adagrad optimizer with a 120 batch sizes and 150 epochs performed slightly better among those optimizers. In addition, an increasing number of epochs can improve the performance of accuracy. It can help to create a broader scope for further experiments on several datasets to perceive the suitable hyper-parameters for the convolutional neural network.

This technique can categorize the movements into several activities and enables us understand the movements. Among the MR, human activity recognition (HAR) is to recognize what a person is doing. HAR has various applications such as rehabilitation engineering, health care, human machine interactive, security based on vision. HAR can be achieved with the help of sensor data or camera based vision information. The vision information results from monocular/binocular cameras, whereas the sensor data in general are from wearable sensors or sensors embedded in smartphones. The measured data are analyzed to carry out HAR. The data analysis methods include machine learning and neural networks. In the neural network based data analysis, the introduced time series data are converted into images, and the images are used for training of neural networks. In this paper, a new accuracy enhanced method is proposed in convolution neural network based HAR. If two images have their unique features, person may recognize the difference between the two images. Motivated from this intuition, this paper suggests a new method to add the unique feature, resulting in more precise accuracy. In this paper, firstly an optimal image conversion method is found via base line tests and secondly a reasonable neural network without overfitting is designed by trimming hyper parameters. From the experimental results, it is verified that the proposed method is valid and effective."

Various solutions such as firewalls, VPNs, and virtualization systems are introduced to respond to threats from outsiders, and as a result, the number of cases of information leakage caused by threats from outsiders is greatly reduced. However, information leakage through threats from insiders is more damaging than threats from outsiders, making it difficult to detect in advance, and the amount of damage after information leakage can be much larger. In order to prevent information leakage through smartphone filming, which is one of insider's information leakage path, it currently uses hardware, smartphone camera security stickers, screen security films, and software uses smartphone MDM (Mobile Device Management) solutions to limit functions such as smartphone photography and data communication. In this paper, we propose a study on the information leakage protection system through smartphone shooting by installing a camera on a PC with access to sensitive information, collecting video information from cameras and designing a smartphone object detection algorithm. For this purpose, the camera is installed at the top of the center of the screen. Image frames are transmitted in real time from camera. In addition, real-time object detection is possible using YOLO, which has fast computational speed. The purpose of this paper is to develop a system for detecting smartphone objects from video information inputted from cameras.

In this study, data obtained from Singapore Maritime Dataset (SMD) and public datasets such as MARVEL, FleetMon, and VesselFinder were labeled and integrated into a unified dataset for further study for ship classification. The ship image dataset was classified into seven classes, including bulk carrier, container ship, cruise ship, naval surface ship, tanker, tug boat, and buoy. Subsequently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based on GoogleNet, VGG16, and ResNet were implemented for ship image classification, and a comparative test was done.

We proposed a progressive occupancy network architecture that can recover not only the overall shape of the object but also the local details. Unlike the original occupancy network, which uses a feature vector embedding information of the whole image, we extract and utilize the different levels of image features depending on the receptive field size. We also propose a novel network architecture that applies the image features sequentially to the decoder blocks in the decoder and improves the quality of the reconstructed 3D shape progressively. In addition, we design a novel decoder block structure that combines the different levels of image features properly and uses them for updating the input point feature. We trained our progressive occupancy network with ShapeNet. We compare its representation power with two prior methods, including prior occupancy network(ONet) and the recent work(DISN) that used different levels of image features like ours. From the perspective of evaluation metrics, our network shows better performance than ONet for all the metrics, and it achieved a little better or a compatible score with DISN. For visualization results, we found that our method successfully reconstructs the local details that ONet misses. Also, compare with DISN that fails to reconstruct the thin parts or occluded parts of the object, our progressive occupancy network successfully catches the parts. These results validate the usefulness of the proposed network architecture."

DNN-based LTE Signal Propagation Modelling for Positioning Fingerprint DB Generation,2021,"['LTE RSRP', 'positioning fingerprint database', 'signal propagation model', 'DNN', 'deep learning']",,"In this paper, we propose a signal propagation modeling technique for generating a positioning fingerprint DB based on Long Term Evolution (LTE) signals. When a DB is created based on the location-based signal information collected in an urban area, gaps in the DB due to uncollected areas occur. The spatial interpolation method for filling the gaps has limitations. In addition, the existing gap filling technique through signal propagation modeling does not reflect the signal attenuation characteristics according to directions occurring in urban areas by considering only the signal attenuation characteristics according to distance. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based signal propagation functionalization technique that considers distance and direction together. To verify the performance of this technique, an experiment was conducted in Seocho-gu, Seoul. Based on the acquired signals, signal propagation characteristics were modeled for each method, and Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSE) was calculated using the verification data to perform comparative analysis. As a result, it was shown that the proposed technique is improved by about 4.284 dBm compared to the existing signal propagation model. Through this, it can be confirmed that the DNN-based signal propagation model proposed in this paper is excellent in performance, and it is expected that the positioning performance will be improved based on the fingerprint DB generated through it."

However, the problem is that basic writing classes are not well linked to new attempts such as “writing by category”, “writing by topic” and “creative writing”.To solve these problems, it is necessary to apply “narrative theory” to writing classes. Narrative theory provides a theoretical background that encompasses the entire writing process in story creation and the way the story is narrated.The concept of articulation in narrative theory is good for informatizing the world and text. Paraphrases and structural theories are useful tools for reading and organizing text(such as major books and academic books), as well as for narratives.Through the “deep structure”, students can read invisible power, will, impulse, and subject matter; think critically; and further learn how to write creatively.If we apply narrative theory to writing education in universities, we can design new writing classes that are different from middle and high school. In addition, classes related to “writing by Department”, “writing by genre”, “logical writing” and “creative writing” are also possible. Therefore, efforts to apply narrative theory to writing education need to continue."
Road Type Identification Ahead of the Tire Using D-CNN and Reflected Ultrasonic Signals,2021,"['Ultrasonic sensor', 'Road type identification', 'Friction coefficient', 'Short-time Fourier transform', 'Machinelearning', 'Deep convolutional neural network']",,"Every land moving object accelerates or decelerates based on the frictional coefficient of the road surface. It has been known that this coefficient on the road is determined by the type of road surface. In this work, we propose a simplistic, machine-learning based solution to estimate the road type using the reflected ultrasonic signals paired with ultrasonic transmitter and receiver. Since the reflected signal contains the material information of the surface due to the difference in the surface roughness and acoustic impedance, different characteristics can be observed for each frequency of the reflected signal. To exploit such characteristics, the signals are transformed into the frequency domain using short-time Fourier transform. In addition, a deep convolutional neural network is applied as the road identifier due to its well-known representational power. In order to verify the aforementioned ideas, the ample database consisting of eight types of road surfaces are obtained with the ultrasonic sensors. And then, the database is used to train the model, as well as to evaluate the accuracy of the trained model. It can be seen that the proposed method makes it easier and more accurate to identify the type of road surface than the conventional methods."

To solve this problem, we designed an algorithm that recognizes the shape, attribute, and emotional information of the product included in the image with AI, and codes this information to represent all the information that the image has with a combination of codes.

Approach and application to transfer heterogeneous simulation data from finite element analysis to neural networks,2021,"[': plausibility check', 'finite element simulation', 'spherical detector surface', 'deep neural network', 'convolutional neural network', 'simulation DNA']",,"The simulation of product behavior is a vital part of current virtual product development. It can be expected that soon there will be more product simulations due to the availability of easy-to-use finite element analysis software and computational power. Consequently, the amount of accessible new simulation data adds up to the already existing amount. However, even when using easy-to-use finite element software tools, errors can occur during the setup of finite element simulations, and users should be warned about certain mistakes by automatic algorithms. To use the vast amount of available finite element simulations for a data-driven finite element support tool, in this paper, a methodology will be presented to transform different finite element simulations to unified matrices. The procedure is based on the projection of nodes onto a detector sphere, which is converted into a matrix in the next step. The generated matrices represent the simulation and can be described as the DNA of a finite element simulation. They can be used as an input for any machine learning model, such as convolutional neural networks. The essential steps of preprocessing the data and an application with a large dataset are part of this contribution. The trained network can then be used for an automatic plausibility check for new simulations, based on the previous simulation data from the past.

In order to deal with the content creation with new technologies, we analyze related creation tools, services and technologies that process with raw visual and audio data, generate new media contents and visualize intermediate results. We then extract key requirements for a future creation tool for creators who are not familiar with programming and artificial intelligence. We finally introduce an intuitive and integrated content creation tool for end-users. We hope that this tool will allow creators to intuitively and creatively generate new media arts and culture contents based on not only understanding given data but also adopting new technologies."

In the fashion domain, which is one of those fields, services that employ fashion item classification method or detection method are introduced. In the case of fashion style classification addressed in this study, a class imbalance problem occurs due to the fashion trends in the data collection process. Therefore, we adopt VAE(Variational AutoEncoder) to cope with the class imbalance problem that causes low classification performance for the classes with few data. Through the probability distribution of VAE’s latent variable, the proposed model samples more latent variables for the classes with few data. Since the classifier is learned from these various latent variables representing a single image, overfitting that occurs when learning with an oversampling method is avoided. As a result of experiments, the proposed model improved performances compared with the model trained with an oversampling method."

Sometimes its effect extends to the eastern coast of Korea peninsula through the Korea Strait. Specifically, the CDW has a significant impact on marine physics and ecology and causes damage to fisheries and aquaculture. However, due to the limited field surveys, continuous observation of the CDW in the East China Sea is practically difficult. Many studies have been conducted using satellite measurements to monitor CDW distribution in near-real time. In this study, an algorithm for estimating Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) in the East China Sea was developed using the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI). The Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MPNN) method was employed for developing an algorithm, and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) SSS data was selected for the output. In the previous study, an algorithm for estimating SSS using GOCI was trained by 2016 observation data. By comparison, the train data period was extended from 2015 to 2020 to improve the algorithm performance. The validation results with the National Institute of Fisheries Science (NIFS) serial oceanographic observation data from 2011 to 2019 show 0.61 of coefficient of determination (R2) and 1.08 psu of Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE). This study was carried out to develop an algorithm for monitoring the surface salinity of the East China Sea using GOCI and is expected to contribute to the development of the algorithm for estimating SSS by using GOCI-II."

And this paper applied Image Sharpening(IS), Histogram Equalization(HE), and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization(CLAHE) to the original image. Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio(PSNR) and Structural Similarity index for Measuring image quality(SSIM) were used to assess the quality of images objectively. As a result of assessment, IS showed 81.75dB of PSNR and 0.96 of SSIM, showing the best image quality. CLAHE and HE showed the PSNR of 62.67dB and 62.60dB respectively, while SSIM of CLAHE was shown as 0.86, which is closer to 1 than HE of 0.75. Using ResNet-50 model with transfer learning, digital image-processed images are classified into normal and abnormal each. In conclusion, the classification accuracy of each model is as follows. 90.77% for IS, which shows the highest, 90.26% for CLAHE and 87.60% for HE.

Monthly data was compiled from upstream and downstream water quality monitoring stations in the Hwang River over the period of January 2007 through December 2020, from which training and test sets were constructed in the ratio of 70:30. The performance of CNN consisting of single and multiple layers were evaluated separately using univariate data with single dependent variable (i.e., either chemical oxygen demand (COD) or chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) as well as multivariate data with dependent and 9 independent variables. The results showed that the prediction accuracy of the proposed CNN algorithm tested with univariate data was noticeably higher for COD than for Chl-a (in terms of target variable) as well as for multiple layers than for single layer (with respect to model architecture). In addition, the CNN algorithm evaluated with multivariate data achieved had better prediction performance than that of univariate data although its performance varied widely among data sets, and to a less extent, among stations and target variables. No measurable difference was also found in prediction performance of the CNN algorithm (for two target dependent variables) according to the number of (important) independent variables. All these results demonstrate that while the proposed CNN algorithm can be adopted to predict (monthly) water quality variables, its careful architecture design is yet required to achieve substantial performance improvement."

Efficient Visual Sentiment Detector using Knowledge Distillation,2021,"['visual sentiment analysis', 'neural network', 'pre-trained model', 'deep learning', 'distillation']",,"In this paper, distillation method is used to build neural networks for efficient visual sentiment detector. An ensemble of many layers or a single large model are commonly used at training stage to increase the performance. Although the delay is not as much as it is for training, a lot of resources are still needed at deployment stage. As a result, mobile devices with limited computing power and resources cannot fully deploy those large networks. On the other hand, the performance is decreased using small networks for low-powered devices. To tackle this problem, we used knowledge distillation method to improve the performance of small networks. Using distillation method, the proposed small network can perform as much as VGGNet, which is trained with large number of parameters. The distilled model that is trained fast can be used to build an ensemble model and it is expected to contribute to build a real-time visual sentiment detector."

CNN-based Fast Split Mode Decision Algorithm for Versatile Video Coding (VVC) Inter Prediction,2021,"['Versatile Video Coding (VVC)', 'Inter Prediction', 'Fast algorithm', 'Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)', 'Deep learning']",,"Versatile Video Coding (VVC) is the latest video coding standard developed by Joint Video Exploration Team (JVET). In VVC, the quadtree plus multi-type tree (QT+MTT) structure of coding unit (CU) partition is adopted, and its computational complexity is considerably high due to the brute-force search for recursive rate-distortion (RD) optimization. In this paper, we aim to reduce the time complexity of inter-picture prediction mode since the inter prediction accounts for a large portion of the total encoding time. The problem can be defined as classifying the split mode of each CU. To classify the split mode effectively, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) called multi-level tree (MLT-CNN) architecture is introduced. For boosting classification performance, we utilize additional information including inter-picture information while training the CNN. The overall algorithm including the MLT-CNN inference process is implemented on VVC Test Model (VTM) 11.0. The CUs of size 128×128 can be the inputs of the CNN. The sequences are encoded at the random access (RA) configuration with five QP values {22, 27, 32, 37, 42}.

However, the accuracy is lower than other methods such as using facial images or video signals. In this paper, we propose an emotion recognition using speech signals and text simultaneously to achieve better performance. For training, we generate 43 feature vectors like mfcc, spectral features and harmonic features from audio data. Also 256 embedding vectors is extracted from text data using pretrained Tacotron encoder. Feature vectors and text embedding vectors are fed into each LSTM layer and fully connected layer which produces a probability distribution over predicted output classes. By combining the average of both results, the data is assigned to one of four emotion categories : anger, happiness, sadness, neutrality. Our proposed model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods when they use Korean emotional speech dataset."
Road Damage Detection and Classification based on Multi-level Feature Pyramids,2021,"['Multi-level Feature Pyramids', 'Road Damage Detection', 'VGG16', 'Multi-scale', 'Multi-level']",,"Road damage detection is important for road maintenance. With the development of deep learning, more and more road damage detection methods have been proposed, such as Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN and RetinaNet. However, because shallow and deep layers cannot be extracted at the same time, the existing methods do not perform well in detecting objects with fewer samples. In addition, these methods cannot obtain a highly accurate detecting bounding box. This paper presents a Multi-level Feature Pyramids method based on M2det. Because the feature layer has multi-scale and multi-level architecture, the feature layer containing more information and obvious features can be extracted. Moreover, an attention mechanism is used to improve the accuracy of local boundary boxes in the dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method is better than the current state-of-the-art methods."

Epileptic seizures occur irregularly and are emergency situations that can lead to brain damage or even death if happen continuously. Therefore, real-time detection of epileptic seizures is important for rapid treatment. However, due to some technical limitations like sensitivity of sensors, it is difficult to accurately measure EEG even in hospitals. Also, it is even more difficult to commercialize wearable devices. Therefore, human activity recognition on 3-axis accelerometer streams is a realistic alternative for real-time detection of epileptic seizures. In this paper, we propose a epileptic seizure detection method based on finite difference and CNN for 3-axis accelerometer streams measured from smart devices. The proposed method considers the medical characteristics of epileptic seizures to calculate the finite difference of each axis, and carries out multivariate analysis based on CNN to integratively consider the relationship between rate of changes of each. Our experiments show that our method can detect the epileptic seizures with a probability of more than 99% from 17 types of daily activities including repetitive activities in short cycles being thought to be similar to epileptic seizures such as brushing teeth and sawing besides typical movements like walking or running."

By Korean Philosophy, I mean the attempt to find universal solutions to the specific social realities faced by Koreans. Making Confucian Sage AI refers to the process of resolving the present Korean problems of the damage of fairness, the extreme wealth polarization, and ideological confrontation among Koreans. This kind of thinking is possible because the educational program for Confucian sage and the learning process of AI are similar. It is characterized not by centralized, sequential, and rational, but by local, integrated, and emotional. These similarities are pointed out under the assumption of a behaviorist interpretation of virtue, a functionalist interpretation of emotion, and an objectivist interpretation of enlightenment. Even if this attempt to 'make Confucian sage AI' fails in its implementation, it will be of great help in terms of philosophical and educational aspects. This is because, in the end, ‘making Confucian sage AI’ will be a process of exploration of collective intelligence to solve social problems."

Currently, large corporations and several countries are making large-scale investments, seeing AI technology as the core of their industrial competitiveness. There is no limit to the field of use of artificial intelligence, and its capabilities are expected to be endless in the future. Based on the impact of AI on the game of Go, we can predict the future impact of the development of artificial intelligence on society and communities. First, even if artificial intelligence develops, the current social system is not expected to be greatly affected for the time being. Because artificial intelligence is a machine, it is a tool that can be used by humans and is not a competitor to humans. Second, the computational power of artificial intelligence affects the technological development of Baduk. Third, the development of artificial intelligence requires a new code of conduct. Because Go players are tempted to win the game by using artificial intelligence without their opponents knowledge, policies to properly prevent and control this are necessary. In this article, the necessity, legal structure, and important issues related to the regulation of artificial intelligence are reviewed. Artificial intelligence has a great impact in that it replaces human cognitive and computational abilities by machines, and in that the development of artificial intelligence technology and its application fields are rapidly spread along with the development of science and technology. The role of administration is important to increase the usefulness of artificial intelligence and reduce potential harm. The administration should also function as a facilitator for the development of artificial intelligence technology, but there should be no shortages in its activity as a monitor to prevent infringement on the rights and interests of the people. As for laws related to artificial intelligence, autonomous laws centered on large corporations are important, and national regulations also have a larger space for use of soft laws such as guidelines rather than acts. Algorithms, which are the methods of operation of artificial intelligence, are based on their own rules. The codes that organize them are similar to laws, but because of their concealed nature and anonymity, they are different from national laws formed by congressional procedures and promulgated to the public. Care should be taken to ensure that ruled by law is not ruled by code. The administration has already carried out a significant part of the investigation, diagnosis and regulation using artificial intelligence in the areas of road traffic, taxation, punishment, education and health, and it is expected that there will be more and more applications of artificial intelligence in the future. The protection of privacy and non-discrimination are required and monitored by the state against large AI companies. However, when the state directly uses artificial intelligence to conduct administration, care must be taken not to infringe on the rights and interests of the people themselves. When the number of tasks and disputes related to artificial intelligence increase, a national organization that is responsible for dealing with them should be established. The 4th Industrial Revolution Committee, which is currently organized, focuses on the development and application of artificial intelligence, so it is evaluated that it is not enough as an institution for regulation such as protecting the basic rights of the people and ensuring transparency of algorithms. In the future, an independent and efficient agency on artificial intelligence should be established in Korea."

In particular, the development of a prediction model that can ensure full penetration back-bead is required for the automation of root pass welding. In this study, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model was applied to predict the occurrence of back-bead in V-groove butt joint GMA root pass welding. The bead profile was measured using a laser vision sensor system and it was used as the input data for the prediction model, and the bead occurrence was used as the output data for the model. A total of 12,873 bead profiles were extracted and pre-processed through cutting, resizing, and thresholding. The CNN model consists of nine layers, and performs three convolution and two pooling operations. The accuracy of the prediction model was 99.5%, and through this study, it was demonstrated that the quality of root-pass welding can be controlled by using convolutional neural network and it can contribute to automation."

Though there is an expense calculated by fixed rate, it is more urgent to spend the set amount according to the situation rather than standards due to the ambiguous criteria. Consequently, OSHME used nominally to make contract rather than to educate and protect the safety of workers. Therefore, in this research, OSHME was predicted by applying Deep Neural Network (DNN) with various optimizer, epoch, nodes based on 135 general construction cases under 500 million won to compare from multivariate regression analysis and origin contract cost multiplied existing rate by applying error indicators, mean squared error (MSE) and mean absoloute error (MAE). As a result, by comparing the values from three different analysis, DNN model with bayesian regularization optimizer in 0.01 learning rate was outstanding method to predict OSHME. Rather than simply executing as the current law, multiplying direct labor and material costs by a certain percentage, proposed model would support to calculate construction costs efficiently. Especially, as the contract material costs show high impact on consumed OSHME, when the sum of labor and material costs is the same, if material costs are high, it is required that OSHME be set higher. Furthermore, it is necessary to specify clear criteria and detailed usage plans to ensure not to execute incorrectly."

Therefore, the importance of a personalized recommendation service that can provide customized products and services to users is emerging. For example, global companies such as Netflix, Amazon, and Google have introduced personalized recommendation services to support users purchasing decisions. Accordingly, the users information search cost can reduce which can positively affect the companys sales increase. The existing personalized recommendation service research applied Collaborative Filtering (CF) technique predicts user preference mainly use quantified information. However, the recommendation performance may have decreased if only use quantitative information. To improve the problems of such existing studies, many studies using reviews to enhance recommendation performance. However, reviews contain factors that hinder purchasing decisions, such as advertising content, false comments, meaningless or irrelevant content. When providing recommendation service uses a review that includes these factors can lead to decrease recommendation performance. Therefore, we proposed a novel recommendation methodology through CNN-based review usefulness score prediction to improve these problems. The results show that the proposed methodology has better prediction performance than the recommendation method considering all existing preference ratings. In addition, the results suggest that can enhance the performance of traditional CF when the information on review usefulness reflects in the personalized recommendation service."

KSURE(Korea Trade Insurance Corporation) is a major public institution for financial policy in Korea, and thus the company is strongly committed to backing export companies with various systems. Nevertheless, there are still fewer cases of realized business model based on big-data analyses.  In this situation, this paper aims to develop a new business model which can be applied to an ex-ante prediction for the likelihood of the insurance accident of credit guarantee. We utilize internal data from KSURE which supports export companies in Korea and apply machine learning models. Then, we conduct performance comparison among the predictive models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and DNN(Deep Neural Network).  For decades, many researchers have tried to find better models which can help to predict bankruptcy since the ex-ante prediction is crucial for corporate managers, investors, creditors, and other stakeholders. The development of the prediction for financial distress or bankruptcy was originated from Smith(1930), Fitzpatrick(1932), or Merwin(1942). One of the most famous models is the Altmans Z-score model(Altman, 1968) which was based on the multiple discriminant analysis. This model is widely used in both research and practice by this time. The author suggests the score model that utilizes five key financial ratios to predict the probability of bankruptcy in the next two years. Ohlson(1980) introduces logit model to complement some limitations of previous models. Furthermore, Elmer and Borowski(1988) develop and examine a rule-based, automated system which conducts the financial analysis of savings and loans.  Since the 1980s, researchers in Korea have started to examine analyses on the prediction of financial distress or bankruptcy. Kim(1987) analyzes financial ratios and develops the prediction model. Also, Han et al.(1995, 1996, 1997, 2003, 2005, 2006) construct the prediction model using various techniques including artificial neural network. Yang(1996) introduces multiple discriminant analysis and logit model. Besides, Kim and Kim(2001) utilize artificial neural network techniques for ex-ante prediction of insolvent enterprises. After that, many scholars have been trying to predict financial distress or bankruptcy more precisely based on diverse models such as Random Forest or SVM. One major distinction of our research from the previous research is that we focus on examining the predicted probability of default for each sample case, not only on investigating the classification accuracy of each model for the entire sample.  Most predictive models in this paper show that the level of the accuracy of classification is about 70% based on the entire sample. To be specific, LightGBM model shows the highest accuracy of 71.1% and Logit model indicates the lowest accuracy of 69%. However, we confirm that there are open to multiple interpretations. In the context of the business, we have to put more emphasis on efforts to minimize type 2 error which causes more harmful operating losses for the guaranty company. Thus, we also compare the classification accuracy by splitting predicted probability of the default into ten equal intervals.  When we examine the classification accuracy for each interval, Logit model has the highest accuracy of 100% for 0~10% of the predicted probability of the default, however, Logit model has a relatively lower accuracy of 61.5% for 90~100% of the predicted probability of the default. On the other hand, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and DNN indicate more desirable results since they indicate a higher level of accuracy for both 0~10% and 90~100% of the predicted probability of the default but have a lower level of accur"

Although Deep Learning Approach to Natural Language Inference shows a very good performance, it does not work for event structure-related inferences. In order to help solving this problem, we built the ESFWN by linking WordNet Synsets with pre-defined event structure frame types. WordNet includes about 2,000 English verbs and 24601 synsets for the verbs. We annotated the corresponding event structure frame type to each synset by applying GESL – the Generator of the Event Structure Lexicon - and then corrected the errors in the annotation results manually. The ESFWN is embedded as a part of the ESFWN-based ESF-Type Classifier we developed. We hope the ESFWN and the classifier are useful for any event structure-related inference tasks including textual or multi-modal inferencing."

The information of the black box model will be transferred to a white box model that we aim to create through the KD. The white box model will learn the representation of the black-box model. Second, the white-box model generates attention maps for each of its layers using Grad-CAM. Then we combine the attention maps of different layers using the pixel-wise summation to generate a final saliency map that contains information from all layers of the model. The experiments show that the proposed technique found important layers and explained which part of the input is important. Saliency maps generated by the proposed technique performed better than those of Grad-CAM in deletion game."

Robustness of Differentiable Neural Computer Using Limited Retention Vector-based Memory Deallocation in Language Model,2021,"['Differentiable Neural Computer', 'DNC', 'Language Model', 'LM', 'Memory Deallocation', 'Retention Vector', 'Robustness']",,"Recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures have been used for language modeling (LM) tasks that require learning long-range word or character sequences. However, the RNN architecture is still suffered from unstable gradients on long-range sequences. To address the issue of long-range sequences, an attention mechanism has been used, showing state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all LM tasks. A differentiable neural computer (DNC) is a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism. The DNC architecture is a neural network augmented with a content-addressable external memory. However, in the write operation, some information unrelated to the input word remains in memory. Moreover, DNCs have been found to perform poorly with low numbers of weight parameters. Therefore, we propose a robust memory deallocation method using a limited retention vector. The limited retention vector determines whether the network increases or decreases its usage of information in external memory according to a threshold. We experimentally evaluate the robustness of a DNC implementing the proposed approach according to the size of the controller and external memory on the enwik8 LM task. When we decreased the number of weight parameters by 32.47%, the proposed DNC showed a low bits-per-character (BPC) degradation of 4.30%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in language modeling tasks."

English essay evaluation is inherently time-consuming. It may reflect teacher bias. English teachers are usually burdened with the task of evaluating many essays in a short period of time. Automated essay scoring (AES) can solve these problems. It has the advantage of being able to evaluate essays in a short time and without bias. In this paper, the RoBERT model was trained and evaluated on Essay Set #8 of the Automated Student Assessment Prize (ASAP) dataset. The 5-fold cross validation evaluation method was used for fair comparison with the previously suggested AES models. As a result, the RoBERT model showed the highest agreement with the human raters’ resolved scores in 5 out of 6 trait scores than the previous evaluation models. The advantage of it is that it can use the pre-trained BERT model and deal with long inputs, overcoming the input size limit of the BERT model. It was confirmed that the RoBERT model works well for trait-specific evaluation of long essays. Thus, the RoBERT model can be used as an auxiliary means to automate the evaluation of students"" essays and reduce the excessive work of English teachers."

Thus, defining the size, aspect ratio, and the number of anchor boxes is important. This study describes a technique of adaptive anchor box selection, based on the pixel size of an image of a projected object located on the ground, through intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters. We applied the pre-trained Darknet53 YOLOv4 model for object detection, as the backbone network, and fine-tuned a classifier to classify both human and vehicle classes using a custom dataset. In addition, we proposed a method to minimize the localization error by correcting magnetic declination when converting the pixel coordinates of the detected object into the global coordinate positions using the image-to-ground projection technique. The performance of the proposed design was validated using photos and videos recorded with DJI Mavic 2 Pro. Our proposed method achieved an enhancement of 13% - 43% for detecting small objects that were not included in the training dataset. A localization error of less than 9% was obtained up to 175 m - the distance between the drone and the object."

Lightweight multiple scale-patch dehazing network for real-world hazy image,2021,"['Image enhancement', 'Convolutional neural networks', 'Image processing']",,"Image dehazing is an ill-posed problem which is far from being solved. Traditional image dehazing methods often yield mediocre effects and possess substandard processing speed, while modern deep learning methods perform best only in certain datasets. The haze removal effect when processed by said methods is unsatisfactory, meaning the generalization performance fails to meet the requirements. Concurrently, due to the limited processing speed, most dehazing algorithms cannot be employed in the industry. To alleviate said problems, a light-weight fast dehazing network based on a multiple scale-patch framework (MSP) is proposed in the present paper. Firstly, the multi-scale structure is employed as the backbone network and the multi-patch structure as the supplementary network. Dehazing through a single net-work causes problems, such as loss of object details and color in some image areas, the multi-patch structure was employed for MSP as an information supplement. In the algorithm image processing module, the image is segmented up and down for processed separately. Secondly, MSP generates a clear dehazing effect and significant robustness when targeting real-world homogeneous and nonhomogeneous hazy maps and different datasets. Compared with existing dehazing methods, MSP demonstrated a fast inference speed and the feasibility of real-time processing. The overall size and model parameters of the entire dehazing model are 20.75M and 6.8M, and the processing time for the single image is 0.026s. Experiments on NTIRE 2018 and NTIRE 2020 demonstrate that MSP can achieve superior performance among the state-of-the-art methods, such as PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and individual subjective evaluation."

"“Don’t the Great Tales Never End?”: Tolkien, History, and the Desire Called Marx",2021,"['Tolkien', 'J', 'R', 'R', 'History', 'Marxism', 'Fantasy', 'the Novel']",,"In a memorable scene from The Lord of the Rings, Samwise Gamgee suddenly realizes the connections between his own story and those legends he had learned in his youth, marveling “Don’t the great tales never end?” Sam’s reference to such grand récits implicates the great metanarrative of History itself, into the midst of which these hobbits find themselves thrust. In this essay, Robert T. Tally Jr. argues that the “realization” of history is an important aim of Tolkien’s art. Tolkien’s yearning for a mythic past, despite its clear nationalism and chauvinism at first, reflected a deep desire to connect his modern world with an august, barely accessible past through forms of historical narrative. This is not an escape into a mythical, premodern realm as is frequently imagined. Rather, it is an attempt to take the broken and disconnected fragments of culture and put them together into a meaningful history, evoking what Tolkien would call “the seamless web of story.” Fredric Jameson, following Lyotard, refers to this as “the desire called Marx.” Tolkien’s experiments with different genres and styles betray the difficulties he had in organizing this overall narrative project, but his impulse in producing a grand narrative involving myth, fairy story, romance, history, and the modern novelistic form is to give shape to a world that had, in his view, lost its sense of history. Through his efforts, Tolkien’s great legendarium provides a historical sensibility for a world that had forgotten how to think historically."

Depending on the role and characteristics of these non-technical elements on technical elements, the establishment of AI inventions is judged differently.The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is pointing out that the patent eligibility criteria for AI inventions actually include the concept of inventiveness. In addition, the European Patent Office (EPO) flexibly judges that if only the technical elements described in claims are not subject to the exclusion of the patent, they are eligible for the patent, and instead strictly judges the inventiveness. On the other hand, in Korea's precedents and patent examination guideline, even if the technical element is using natural law, in case where it is not using natural law as a whole of claims combined with non-technical elements, the establishment of invention is not accepted and finally rejected. Such a strict judgment on the establishment of invention has a problem in that even the opportunity to be judged on the inventiveness would be lost.To solve such a problem, the establishment of the examination process is needed as follows: in principle, the establishment of an AI invention that combines non-technical and non-technical elements should be determined as a whole claims combining non-technical and non-technical elements, but if part or all of the technical constitution is judged to be using natural law, it would not be judged as a whole of claims, but it would be flexibly judged to accept the establishment of invention, and it would be strictly judged in the next step of inventiveness."

He worshiped the medieval poet, Teika and after learning from one of his descendants, Tameyori, himself wrote Waka, Kyoka, and Haikai, together with other poets with whom he had tea meetings. Koborienshu also recited Waka to mourn a dead friend; imitated 47 classical pieces of Kyoka on a trip to Kyoto; and wrote Haikai and Renku, interacting with cultured men. In addition, in 48 of the 148 letters, he poured out his feelings through Waka, Haikai, and others. The Waka in his letters followed the classical pattern, which represented his attitude of reciting the phrases of classical pieces as they were. Many of the songs were rooted in Kokinshu. It was also characterized by the use of homonyms to investigate the multiplicity of meanings. In his travel books, the overall composition followed the form of Tosanikki, but the written songs were markedly influenced by Isemonogatari. Besides, one can find his deep passion for classical Waka from his act of borrowing Waka phrases on tea ceremony tools and the use of the place name of Utamakura."

These are especially beneficial in applications where human lives are threatened. Autonomous navigation in unknown environments is a challenging issue for UAVs where decision-based navigation is required. In this paper, a deep learning (DL) approach is presented that aids autonomous navigation for UAVs in completely unknown, GPS-denied indoor environments. The UAV is equipped with a monocular camera and a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor to determine each next maneuver and distance calculation, respectively. For deeper feature extraction, a version of You Only Look Once (YOLOv3-tiny) is improved by adding a convolution layer with different filter sizes. The process is observed as an exercise where the DL model classifies the targeted image as stairs or not stairs. We created our dataset considering the indoor scenario for specific implementation. Comprehensive experimental results are compared with YOLOv3-tiny, indicating better performance in terms of accuracy, recall, F1-score, precision, and maneuvering movements."

It affects the industry as a whole and daily life in various ways. As data availability increases, artificial intelligence finds an optimal solution and infers/predicts through self-learning. Research and investment related to automation that discovers and solves problems on its own are ongoing continuously. Automation of artificial intelligence has benefits such as cost reduction, minimization of human intervention and the difference of human capability. However, there are side effects, such as limiting the artificial intelligence’s autonomy and erroneous results due to algorithmic bias. In the labor market, it raises the fear of job replacement. Prior studies on the utilization of artificial intelligence have shown that individuals do not necessarily use the information (or advice) it provides. Algorithm error is more sensitive than human error; so, people avoid algorithms after seeing errors, which is called “algorithm aversion.” Recently, artificial intelligence has begun to be understood from the perspective of the augmentation of human intelligence. We have started to be interested in Human-AI collaboration rather than AI alone without human. A study of 1500 companies in various industries found that human-AI collaboration outperformed AI alone. In the medicine area, pathologist-deep learning collaboration dropped the pathologist cancer diagnosis error rate by 85%. Leading AI companies, such as IBM and Microsoft, are starting to adopt the direction of AI as augmented intelligence. Human-AI collaboration is emphasized in the decision-making process, because artificial intelligence is superior in analysis ability based on information. Intuition is a unique human capability so that human-AI collaboration can make optimal decisions. In an environment where change is getting faster and uncertainty increases, the need for artificial intelligence in decision-making will increase. In addition, active discussions are expected on approaches that utilize artificial intelligence for rational decision-making. This study investigates the impact of artificial intelligence on decision-making focuses on human-AI collaboration and the interaction between the decision maker personal traits and advisor type. The advisors were classified into three types: human, artificial intelligence, and human-AI collaboration. We investigated perceived usefulness of advice and the utilization of advice in decision making and whether the decision-maker’s personal traits are influencing factors. Three hundred and eleven adult male and female experimenters conducted a task that predicts the age of faces in photos and the results showed that the advisor type does not directly affect the utilization of advice. The decision-maker utilizes it only when they believed advice can improve prediction performance. In the case of human-AI collaboration, decision-makers higher evaluated the perceived usefulness of advice, regardless of the decision makers personal traits and the advice was more actively utilized. If the type of advisor was artificial intelligence alone, decision-makers who scored high in conscientiousness, high in extroversion, or low in neuroticism, high evaluated the perceived usefulness of the advice so they utilized advice actively. This study has academic significance in that it focuses on human-AI collaboration that the recent growing interest in artificial intelligence roles. It has expanded the relevant research area by considering the role of artificial intelligence as an advisor of decision-making and judgment research, and in aspects of practical significance, suggested views that companies should consider in order to enhance AI capability. To improve the effectiveness of AI-based systems, companies not only must introduce high-performance systems, but also need employees who properly understand digital information presented by AI, and can add non-digital"

Lightweight image classifier for CIFAR-10,2021,"['Computer vision', 'Convolutional neural networks', 'Image classification', 'Lightweight CNN']",,"Image classification is one of the fundamental applications of computer vision. It enables a system to identify an object in an image. Recently, image classification applications have broadened their scope from computer applications to edge devices. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is the main class of deep learning neural networks that are widely used in computer tasks, and it delivers high accuracy. However, CNN algorithms use a large number of parameters and incur high computational costs, which hinder their implementation in edge hardware devices. To address this issue, this paper proposes a lightweight image classifier that provides good accuracy while using fewer parameters. The proposed image classifier diverts the input into three paths and utilizes different scales of receptive fields to extract more feature maps while using fewer parameters at the time of training. This results in the development of a model of small size. This model is tested on the CIFAR-10 dataset and achieves an accuracy of 90% using .26M parameters. This is better than the state-of-the-art models, and it can be implemented on edge devices."

Wintermute in Neuromancer is Tessier-Ashpool SA’s artificial intelligence armed with statistics and mathematics. During Frankenstein monster’s attempt to acquire his female companion and Wintermute’s pursuit to merge with Neuromancer, his sibling artificial intelligence, they exercise murder, fraud, and violence. The monstrosity they show in the challenge derives ultimately from the pains of alienation and isolation, and maladaptation that they suffer. The artificial creatures such as the monster and the artificial intelligence that the creator, an individual or corporation, creates only for their purpose suggest the implicit vision of the future world, but it is not certain whether the future will offer humans hope or danger. The artificial creatures are also members of the posthuman society that will take over the humans’role, competing and struggling with their creators. As the name Frankenstein has ambivalent implications, the creators could be real monsters much more than the creatures are because those who create the monsters with immoderate passion and desire are more dangerous than the creatures. Accordingly, it is important and necessary for humans to control individual or capitalist desire, and also to achieve the co-existent life with balance and harmony in the future posthuman society."

Then, through the DeepFM parameter sharing strategy, the relationship between low- and high-order feature combinations is learned from log data, and the click rate prediction model is constructed. Finally, based on the predicted click-through rate, products are recommended to users in sequence and fed back.

However, most images obtained in the industrial field for quality inspection typically contain noise. This noise is a major factor in the performance of the machine vision system. Therefore, in order to improve the performance of the machine vision system, it is necessary to eliminate the noise of the image. There are lots of research being done to remove noise from the image. In this paper, we propose an autoencoder based machine vision system to eliminate noise in the image.

The Method for Generating Recommended Candidates through Prediction of Multi-Criteria Ratings Using CNN-BiLSTM,2021,"['Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory', 'BiLSTM', 'Convolutional Neural Network', 'CNN', 'Multi-Criteria Recommendation System', 'Recommendation System']",,"To improve the accuracy of the recommendation system, multi-criteria recommendation systems have been widely researched. However, it is highly complicated to extract the preferred features of users and items from the data. To this end, subjective indicators, which indicate a user’s priorities for personalized recommendations, should be derived. In this study, we propose a method for generating recommendation candidates by predicting multi-criteria ratings from reviews and using them to derive user priorities. Using a deep learning model based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), multi-criteria prediction ratings were derived from reviews. These ratings were then aggregated to form a linear regression model to predict the overall rating. This model not only predicts the overall rating but also uses the training weights from the layers of the model as the user’s priority. Based on this, a new score matrix for recommendation is derived by calculating the similarity between the user and the item according to the criteria, and an item suitable for the user is proposed. The experiment was conducted by collecting the actual “TripAdvisor” dataset. For performance evaluation, the proposed method was compared with a general recommendation system based on singular value decomposition. The results of the experiments demonstrate the high performance of the proposed method."

Since most of these cameras are installed outdoors, they are under various shooting environments. In particular, in heavy rain conditions, face recognition becomes difficult because visibility of a captured image is significantly reduced due to rain streaks or rain accumulation. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a face super-resolution deep learning model for improving face recognition in heavy rain conditions. Specifically, we propose a heavy rain removal module for removing rain streaks and rain accumulation from a low-resolution face image taken in a heavy rain condition, a face parsing module for segmenting a structured face image, and a high-resolution module for converting a low-resolution face image to a high-resolution one. Through the experimental results, we want to show that the proposed super-resolution method can restore a clear, high-resolution image that can recognize a face even from a low-visibility, low-resolution face image."

In this paper, YOLO models were used due to their high speed and good accuracy in classification and target detection. A SMD detection and classification method using YOLO networks based on robust data preprocessing and augmentation techniques to deal with various types of variation such as illumination and geometric changes is proposed.

Video Expression Recognition Method Based on Spatiotemporal Recurrent Neural Network and Feature Fusion,2021,"['Double Layer Cascade Structure', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Feature Fusion', 'Image Detection', 'Spatiotemporal Recursive Neural Network']",,"Automatically recognizing facial expressions in video sequences is a challenging task because there is little direct correlation between facial features and subjective emotions in video. To overcome the problem, a video facial expression recognition method using spatiotemporal recurrent neural network and feature fusion is proposed. Firstly, the video is preprocessed. Then, the double-layer cascade structure is used to detect a face in a video image. In addition, two deep convolutional neural networks are used to extract the time-domain and airspace facial features in the video. The spatial convolutional neural network is used to extract the spatial information features from each frame of the static expression images in the video. The temporal convolutional neural network is used to extract the dynamic information features from the optical flow information from multiple frames of expression images in the video. A multiplication fusion is performed with the spatiotemporal features learned by the two deep convolutional neural networks. Finally, the fused features are input to the support vector machine to realize the facial expression classification task. The experimental results on cNTERFACE, RML, and AFEW6.0 datasets show that the recognition rates obtained by the proposed method are as high as 88.67%, 70.32%, and 63.84%, respectively. Comparative experiments show that the proposed method obtains higher recognition accuracy than other recently reported methods."

Pre-harvest crop detection is the most important issue for the harvesting robot system in a real-world environment. In this paper, we proposed a real-time tomato instance tracking algorithm by using deep learning and probability models. In general, It is hard to keep track of the same tomato instance between successive frames, because the tomato growing environment is disturbed by the change of lighting condition and a background clutter without a stochastic approach. Therefore, this work suggests that individual tomato object detection for each frame is conducted by YOLOv3 model, and the continuous instance tracking between frames is performed by Kalman filter and probability model. We have verified the performance of the proposed method, an experiment was shown a good result in real-world test data."

A Vehicle Recognition Method based on Radar and Camera Fusion in an Autonomous Driving Environment,2021,"['Camera', 'Radar', 'Radar and Camera Fusion', 'Vehicle Recognition', 'Autonomous Driving']",,"At a time when securing driving safety is the most important in the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicles, AI and big data-based algorithms are being studied to enhance and optimize the recognition and detection performance of various static and dynamic vehicles. However, there are many research cases to recognize it as the same vehicle by utilizing the unique advantages of radar and cameras, but they do not use deep learning image processing technology or detect only short distances as the same target due to radar performance problems.

The ship was carrying a group of Japanese samurai Yasuda(安田), who was returning to Satsuma after serving in Erabuzima. Yasuda communicated with Chosun officials in writing, sharing conflicts and friendships with Chosun people. In particular, Yasuda shared a deep affection with Yun Yeong-gyu(尹永奎), Biin-hyeonggam, in a short period of time, and exchanged poems with scholars of Chosun. Yasuda recorded what happened during his stay in Chosun and left a diary depicting what he saw, which is the 『Chosun Drifting Diary』 . In this diary, psychological descriptions of the creation and resolution of conflicts, friendship and compassion, and human desire are also shown in relatively detail. Yasuda recorded the emotions of the Chosun people he interacted with, and some Koreans were very friendly to the Japanese samurai who knew how to write. This diary has an auxiliary tool for reading Chinese characters, which makes it easier to learn the order of interpretation of Chinese characters. The sentences were divided, and the recorded characters were modified. There is a question of whose work the ""Okuragana"" and the auxiliary recorded Katagana are. Some of them appear to have been filled out by Yasuda himself, but no information about the remaining marks appears. Yasuda's 『Chosun Drifting Diary』  describes the painting in great detail, and the topography and sea route are painted in the form of a bird's-eye view, indicating that his imagination and spatial awareness were excellent. Yasuda's diary contains a lot of information on Chosun's customs and clothing more than 200 years ago, Chosun's response to the drifting and repatriation process, in addition to the Chosun's ship and the Chosun's topography, which seems to be highly useful as a research material on society of the time. 『Chosun Drifting Diary』 is a record written by the eyes and sensibilities of Yasuda, a Japanese samurai who drifted to Chosun 200 years ago, and contains various clues that do not appear in Chosun's records."
FFWR-Net: A feature fusion wear particle recognition network for wear particle classification,2021,['· Convolutional neural network · Feature fusion · Wear particle classification · Wear particle recognition'],,"Wear particles produced by machines in the process of wear carry valuable information including wear mechanism and wear severity. Wear particle classification based on wear particle images provides predictive analysis for wear condition of machines. A novel wear particle recognition network based on feature fusion, FFWR-Net, is proposed in this research paper for wear particle images classification. In FFWR-Net, traditional feature extraction method by image processing technique (i.e. manually feature extracting) and deep learning convolutional neural network method (i.e. automatically feature extracting) is paralleled to extract the features of wear particle image. Then the features obtained by two different methods are fused together for building a wear particle classifier. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed classifier, it is compared with the previous convolutional neural network models on the same wear particle dataset. The comparison results show the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed FFWR-Net classifier is better than the previous models."

We present a method for real-time automatic detection of abandoned luggage in video captured by surveillance cameras. Most works for abandoned objects detection use a preliminary step to detect foreground regions or objects, and use various techniques including deep learning to distinguish between abandoned luggage items and other objects. These object detection-based methods require direct learning of characteristics of different types of objects. However, it is difficult to detect a new type of unlearned object, and there is insufficient detection of the instantaneous situation in which an object is abandoned. In order to solve these problems, we propose reconstruction-based anomaly detection to identify unusual patterns that do not conform to expected behavior such as abandoning objects. The approach is comprised of two stages - first, static object detection based on YOLOv4 and second, abandoned luggage recognition based on anomaly detection using Ganerative Advesarial Networks (GAN). We demonstrate the proposed GAN-based anomaly detection for abandonment behavior by performing experiments on Abnormal Event CCTV Video Dataset."

Shape from Focus(SFF) acquires 3D information by using 2D images with different focus levels. In each step of image acquisition, mechanical vibration, referred as jitter noise, occurs. Since the jitter noise changes the focus values of 2D images, it significantly degrades the performance of 3D information estimation. In this paper, a new filtering method which reduces the effects of jitter noise in 3D information estimation is proposed. At first, jitter noise and focus curves are modeled as Lé vy distribution and quadratic function, respectively. Next, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network as one of the deep learning techniques is applied to the modeled focus curves for reducing the jitter noise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
CAB: Classifying Arrhythmias based on Imbalanced Sensor Data,2021,"['Bi-LSTM', 'Data Augmentation', 'ECG', 'GAN', 'Heartbeat Classification', 'E-Health']",,"Intelligently detecting anomalies in health sensor data streams (e.g., Electrocardiogram, ECG) can improve the development of E-health industry. The physiological signals of patients are collected through sensors. Timely diagnosis and treatment save medical resources, promote physical health, and reduce complications. However, it is difficult to automatically classify the ECG data, as the features of ECGs are difficult to extract. And the volume of labeled ECG data is limited, which affects the classification performance. In this paper, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based deep learning framework (called CAB) for heart arrhythmia classification. CAB focuses on improving the detection accuracy based on a small number of labeled samples. It is trained based on the class-imbalance ECG data. Augmenting ECG data by a GAN model eliminates the impact of data scarcity. After data augmentation, CAB classifies the ECG data by using a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (Bi-LSTM). Experiment results show a better performance of CAB compared with state-of-the-art methods. The overall classification accuracy of CAB is 99.71%.

The statement that Shifei Shi Xin is the sprout of intellectual virtue provides room for interpreting it as ‘a reasonable faculty for one’s judgment.’ However, this approach is based on the modern way of understanding the human mind, which is divided into two: reason and emotion. Just as Mencius did, Zhu Xi and Wang Yangming were aware that rational judgment would often distort the situations with obsessive analysis, stratagem, and even deep consideration. Thus, I will examine whether Shifei Shi Xin can be separated into rational judgement and how it can be explained if it must be viewed in terms of one of the bundles of four sprouts. This approach also attempts to confirm whether Shifei Shi Xin can lead to a unity between moral virtues and intellectual virtues. I think we should pay attention to the reason why Mencius cast the concept of four sprouts and view the Shifei Shi Xin from a holistic perspective of the four sprouts. I interpret it as a reaction of the mind that occurs regardless of learning or experiences, before any other calculation was involved. It is an immediate and holistic reaction of mental energy to a particular situation that occurs before being classified into the cognitive or the conative. Keeping the pure reactions of the mind occurring initially is soon enough to be moral motivation. Thus, I will review Zhu and Wang on Shifei Shi Xin and Liangzhi (innate knowledge, 良知) for my entire argument. This review must inevitably be understood in the context of the four sprouts. The reason for taking Zhu and Wang’s discourse is to examine the meaning of the internalization of wisdom (Zhi, 智) in terms of the unity between intellectual virtue and moral virtue. In conclusion, a concern on the unity between them is part of a philosophical project to critically reflect on the dualistic framework that has formed modern philosophy, and it is also necessary to understand Shifei Shi Xin in the totality of the mind."

As other parameters in deep learning, however, the type of pooling can be driven by data for a given task. In this paper, we propose α-integration pooling (αI-pooling), which has a trainable parameter α to find the type of pooling. αI-pooling is a general pooling method including max-pooling and arithmetic average-pooling as a special case, depending on the parameter α. Experiments show that αI-pooling outperforms other pooling methods, in image recognition tasks. Also, it turns out that each layer has a different optimal pooling type."
적외선 카메라와 YOLO를 사용한 블랙아이스 탐지 방법,2021,,,"Black ice, which occurs mainly on the road, vehicle traffic bridges and tunnel entrances due to the sub-zero temperature due to the slip of the road due to heavy snow, is not recognized because the image of asphalt is transmitted in the driver's view, so the vehicle loses braking power because it causes serious loss of life and property. In this paper, we propose a method to identify the black ice by using infrared camera and to identify the road condition by using deep learning to compensate for the disadvantages of existing black ice detection methods (artificial satellite imaging, checking the pattern of slip by ultrasonic reception, measuring the temperature of the road surface, and checking the difference in friction force of the tire during vehicle driving) and to reduce the size of the sensor to detect black ice."
터널 콘크리트 라이닝 균열 분석을 위한 의미론적 분할 모델 학습,2021,,,"In order to keep infrastructures such as tunnels and underground facilities safe, cracks of concrete lining in tunnel should be detected by regular inspections. Since regular inspections are accomplished through manual efforts using maintenance lift vehicles, it brings about traffic jam, exposes works to dangerous circumstances, and deteriorates consistency of crack inspection data. This study aims to provide methodology to automatically extract cracks from tunnel concrete lining images generated by the existing tunnel image acquisition system. Specifically, we train a deep learning based semantic segmentation model with open dataset, and evaluate its performance with the dataset from the existing tunnel image acquisition system. In particular, we compare the model performance in case of using all of a public dataset, subset of the public dataset which are related to tunnel surfaces, and the tunnel-related subset with negative examples. As a result, the model trained using the tunnel-related subset with negative examples reached the best performance. In the future, we expect that this research can be used for planning efficient model training strategy for crack detection."

Since it is important to acquire a clear pupil image for accurate pupil detection, multi-focus image fusion has received a lot of attention. Multi-focus image fusion is a technique for extracting a focused region from the blurred images to obtain a image with high sharpness. In multi-focus image fusion, activity level measurement and fusion rule are important factors. Since the existing multi-focus image fusion not only considers activity level measurement and fusion rule separatively, but also becomes more and more complicated, a convolutional neural network as one of the deep learning techniques is proposed in this paper to obtain a multi-focus image fusion results with excellent performance through directly mapping between the blurred images and the focus map. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Most existing content summarization techniques focused on analyzing sentences to extract statistically meaningful words. However, simply considering the syntactic features of words often misses the associations and intrinsic meanings between words. Therefore, a method for extracting key elements and making abstract summaries is needed considering the complex structure and meaning of the sentence. This study applies an attention algorithm-based deep learning model to English review and Korean newspaper article data to generate abstract summaries reflecting the core context. The model in this study successfully generated summary prediction of the English review data by interpreting the meaning of the words. In the case of korean text, although preprocessing is difficult, the results showed significant results in generating predictive summaries similar to actual summaries. The results of manual curation and surveys showed that the inferred summary content effectively generated key words and abstract concepts to summarize sentences. This study will be able to provide time reduction and convenience in the process of delivering information to modern people in the future."

However, the conversations with smart speakers are currently initiated by the users unilateral utterance of the call word, and the conversation does not take into account information or tastes of the users situation. This differs from the general communication characteristics between people. In this work, we evaluate the user preference by different levels of active response of the smart speakers that perform proactive conversations by automatically recognizing the users desk activity.Methods: First, we defined a system concept based on deep learning and rule-based models with data acquired from microphones and sound sensors, human sensitivity sensors, and light sensors to automatically recognize the users desk activity. Second, we divided the task situations that can be judged by the system into 19 different levels, and we derived specific scenarios by dividing the active level of the interaction into four stages: non-response, simple response, situation prediction and suggestion, and proactive response executing the suggestions. Third, we evaluated which level of active interaction is more preferred through user evaluation for each task situation. Results: In most task situations, situation prediction and suggestion and proactive response interactions have been shown to be preferable to non-response, while simple response interactions have been evaluated negatively. In particular, the participants in the experiment were found to be concerned about context interruption, especially in situations where they were immersed in certain tasks or where there were several people together.Conclusions: Smart speakers proactive conversation depending on users context will be very useful if the system’s higher recognition accuracy is supported, thereby providing a more extended user experience."

It has taken an important position with its traditional and decorative craft techniques that have continued to develop since ancient times.Chatter mark is one of the decorative techniques that has a long history in pottery culture, and Chatter mark techniques are common in modern pottery works. In addition, the five techniques that occupy an important position in the deep ceramic historical culture are the Chatter mark technique, abbreviation, color summary, and cyanide. It has been attracting attention as a decorative technique discovered accidentally in the process of cutting heels, and in modern times, many artists have learned this technique and applied it to their works through modern works.In investigating the situation in which the modern ceramic industry uses pottery decoration, there are two ceramic production sites, mainly Yongcheon celadon production sites in China and Ondayaki production sites in Japan. The artist, who decorates with the Chatter mark technique, learned from a survey conducted by a relatively large number of producers working at Yongcheon production site and Ondayaki production site.From studying old craft techniques, it leads to research and investigation, preparation and learning, harvesting and production. Through the research of this paper, new decorative effects were obtained from old ceramic crafts. The effects can be classified into three categories, and first, the attention is focused and the hand stability is maintained to create a pattern at once. Second, the choice of tools is important in producing characteristic chatter mark works. Third, a new style of work can be created according to the artist's technique. chatter mark techniques are used in a variety of ways, and we can make use of chatter mark techniques as much as we want. New effects can be achieved when used in conjunction with other techniques. This effect is expressed in a modern way, pioneering a new art world of chatter mark techniques."

Sensor noise and disturbance factors generated during data acquisition negatively affect the generalization performance of time series motion data analysis and deep learning technology measured by the wearable inertial sensor. Therefore, in this study, the sensor output by muscle activity was defined as disturbance and quantitatively evaluated. To grasp the wearable inertial sensor output by pure muscle activity, a new experimental method (MSRCR) was proposed in which the same muscle activity as that occurring during walking is achieved through the EMG sensor, and sensor data were collected through the proposed experiment. By analyzing the L2-norm values of the acceleration and angular velocity, it was confirmed that the lateral vastus muscle had the least effect on the sensor output."

It needs an image of a human being that can manipulate information appliances or mobile devices skillfully and acquires and adapts to new skills without resistance. However, we can speculate what will be necessary in the future when considering the weaknesses in the early stages of AI. In the era of materialism, human virtues are worthlessly discarded, which leads to the degradation of human values. Therefore, we need an image of a human being that creates a humanity where human nature is recovered.

The most one that we say to AI ‘Genie’ as a product of untact era is ‘Genie, I love you’, and we can guess what people may want from this. Work efficiency is improved by celebrating various anniversaries through emotional management in the workplace that is perceived as a base. As AI improves, humans will continue to thirst for sympathy and physical contact. Thus, a new image of a human being is necessary in the era of 4th industrial resolution, and particularly one that is warm-hearted and one with humanity."

We would like to collect various materials left by Tasan in his own handwriting, restore the meeting between the two, which has not been confirmed before, and confirm the meaning thereof. Tasan continued his friendship with monks from Daedunsa Temple and Mandeoksa Temple during his exile in Gangjin. Through this work, he led the organization of the temple’s history, including Daedunsaji and Mandeoksaji, and left a number of Buddhist-related poems that were not left out in his collection.Tasan’s relationship with the Buddhist monks was ostensibly the starting point of his friendship with Aam Hyejang. However, the relationship between Tasan and Yeondam, who met when he was studying in his father’s post, who was down to Hwasun at the age of 16, became the medium of connecting Tasan with Buddhism.Yeondam was the teacher of Aham’s teacher, and Aham himself learned from him.Tasan first met Yeondam in 1777, when he was 16 years old. He was well-known as a famous lecturer and was good at poetry. There are many poems exchanged with Yeondam in the literary collection of his father, Jeong Jae-won, and there are still poems left in the literary collection of Yeondam. It also contains poems given to young Tasan during this period. Tasan also expressed his deep respect for his noble appearance in his literary collection. Yeondam provided a place for the Tasan brothers to study for their past exams, visited frequently, and encouraged them.24 years later, in 1802, when Tasan, who came down to exile at Gangjin, asked about him, Yeondam had already passed away. In response, Tasan, who obtained and read his literary works, expressed disappointment with the editing, and insisted on correcting the errors and publishing them anew. As a result, the new edited version was prepared directly, and several letters and prose writing this process remained as handwritten letters. Most of these materials were omitted from Tasan’s collection, apparently because they were reluctant to engage with monks closely. Tasan’s counterpart in discussing the publication of Yeondam’s literary works was Wanho, a disciple of Yeondam, and Hoyi, a disciple of Wanho. However, the publishing a new collection of literary works probably did not pay off due to financial problems.Tasan put Yeondam on the central stem of the Honam instructor’s genealogy, and saw that the central genealogy from the great Monk Seosan led to Yeondam. Considering that he had established the central genealogy and that Aam and Choyi had been established again, he wanted to establish the legitimacy of the the central genealogy. This is complicatedly intertwined with the complex compositional arrangement of the Daedunsa central genealogy. This Paper is a prerequisite discussion to collect and introduce various verses left by Tasan in one place and to deepen discussions related to the future."
Fundamental Research for Video-Integrated Collision Prediction and Fall Detection System to Support Navigation Safety of Vessels,2021,"['Navigation safety', 'Video-integrated', 'Collision prediction', 'Fall detection', 'Automatic identification system']",,"Marine accidents caused by ships have brought about economic and social losses as well as human casualties. Most of these accidents are caused by small and medium-sized ships and are due to their poor conditions and insufficient equipment compared with larger vessels. Measures are quickly needed to improve the conditions. This paper discusses a video-integrated collision prediction and fall detection system to support the safe navigation of small- and medium-sized ships. The system predicts the collision of ships and detects falls by crew members using the CCTV, displays the analyzed integrated information using automatic identification system (AIS) messages, and provides alerts for the risks identified. The design consists of an object recognition algorithm, interface module, integrated display module, collision prediction and fall detection module, and an alarm management module. For the basic research, we implemented a deep learning algorithm to recognize the ship and crew from images, and an interface module to manage messages from AIS. To verify the implemented algorithm, we conducted tests using 120 images. Object recognition performance is calculated as mAP by comparing the pre-defined object with the object recognized through the algorithms. As results, the object recognition performance of the ship and the crew were approximately 50.44 mAP and 46.76 mAP each. The interface module showed that messages from the installed AIS were accurately converted according to the international standard. Therefore, we implemented an object recognition algorithm and interface module in the designed collision prediction and fall detection system and validated their usability with testing."

Some of the advantages that promote their widespread usage include their long battery cycle life, high durability, low self-discharge rate, and fast charge rate. However, despite their superiority in comparison with other power sources, there exists a lack of understanding regarding their battery lifetime owing to their sophisticated electrochemical actions, which cannot be sufficiently modeled and predicted using traditional physics-based models. This limitation has motivated the development of numerous data-driven approaches. However, data-driven methods also have certain limitations, such as low interpretability and inability to extrapolate well. This necessitates an alternative method that can leverage the strengths of both models while complementing their drawbacks. In this study, the state-of-health of lithium-ion batteries is estimated using a physics-informed neural network with the integration of physics in the deep learning pipeline. The results of this study indicate that the proposed model outperforms the conventional data-driven methods in RMSE and physical inconsistency."

Many graph embedding techniques attempt to represent the similarity of nodes in local subgraphs as the distance in vector space. Deep learning for real-world graph-structured data poses great challenges for the interpretation of the result, as the entangled information is induced by complex interactions of neighborhood nodes together with many latent factors. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a mutual information-based method to have a good performance on link prediction as well as to produce an interpretable subgraph for the link. Mutual information is used to find a subgraph that plays an important role in maximizing the similarity of two nodes and to give an explanation statistically. Our method effectively predicts the link by utilizing subgraphs based on the importance of the nodes and the edges for link prediction. At the same time, it gives a compact explanation for link prediction by mutual information."
Framework for Reconstructing 2D Data Imported from Mobile Devices into 3D Models,2021,"['3D Reconstruction', 'Backend', 'Frontend', 'AI', 'Mobile']",,"The 3D industry is drawing attention for its applications in various markets, including architecture, media, VR/AR, metaverse, imperial broadcast, and etc.. The current feature of the architecture we are introducing is to make 3D models more easily created and modified than conventional ones. Existing methods for generating 3D models mainly obtain values using specialized equipment such as RGB-D cameras and Lidar cameras, through which 3D models are constructed and used. This requires the purchase of equipment and allows the generated 3D model to be verified by the computer. However, our framework allows users to collect data in an easier and cheaper manner using cell phone cameras instead of specialized equipment, and uses 2D data to proceed with 3D modeling on the server and output it to cell phone application screens. This gives users a more accessible environment. In addition, in the 3D modeling process, object classification is attempted through deep learning without user intervention, and mesh and texture suitable for the object can be applied to obtain a lively 3D model. It also allows users to modify mesh and texture through requests, allowing them to obtain sophisticated 3D models."

Malware family classification is a technique for classifying malware samples into related malware families and plays an important role in computer forensic analysis, threat assessment, and threat mitigation planning. In this paper, we propose a method to classify Android malware families by converting only part of an executable file into a gray scale image and applying deep learning to the converted images. The malware samples are classified from the representative families of the dataset from the Drebin project by applying the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The experimental results show that the proposed method is more effective in classifying malware families in terms of processing overhead and classification accuracy."
원자로 초소형 내시경의 실시간 영상 잡음 제거 기법,2021,"['Image noise removal', 'Total variation', 'Optimization', 'Micro-endoscope', 'Nuclear power plant']",,"In this paper, we propose a high-speed image noise removal module that can remove image noise in real time from image signals transmitted through a microscopic endoscope device to inspect the inside of the upper bundle of a standard steam generator installed in a high radiation area of a nuclear power plant. The total variation (TV) minimization-based image noise removal technique is evaluated to have excellent noise removal performance while reducing image boundary blurring. In this paper, we propose a smoothing norm function for efficient image noise removal and a TV loss function incorporating this function. This paper shows that Adamax has a fast convergence speed and excellent noise removal performance, by applying and analyzing various optimization search techniques used in deep neural network learning to the proposed TV loss function minimization. By implementing the proposed TV-based noise removal algorithm Adamax-TV on edge computer level GPUs, it is shown that the noise removal of the VGA-class image of nuclear reactor endoscope can be processed in real time at a rate of 15 to 27 fps."

First, a lightweight cable-driven platform and remote access environment were configured for the experiment. Next, a TensorFlow Lite environment was configured in the control computer, and an object detection algorithm was applied to the images obtained from the camera on the cable-driven platform. Subsequently, the bounding box coordinates of the object and class information were used as the inputs, as well as the camera specifications, GPS information, and the actual size information of the object to estimate the coordinates of the object. However, the significant limitations in the performance of CPU, GPU, and memory restrict the applications of high-performance deep learning models in a mobile platform environment. Therefore, in this study, a lightweight model, such as MobileNet SSD v2 was applied, and Google Edge TPU, which can use TensorFlow Lite environment, was used to facilitate computations, such as real-time object detection and coordinate estimation. In addition, this study presented a method for assigning a unique ID to a detected object and tracking it using the Euclidean distance, and the advantages of a simple algorithm using GPS data and a single moving camera in the surveillance field were presented."

Among the news we encounter is news that an individual or organization intentionally writes something that is not true to achieve a particular purpose, so-called fake news. In this study, we intend to design a system that uses Artificial Intelligence techniques to identify fake content that exists within the news. The proposed identification model will propose a method of extracting multiple unit factors from the target content. Through this, attempts will be made to classify unit factors into different types. In addition, the design of the preprocessing process will be carried out to parse only the necessary information by analyzing the unit factor. Based on these results, we will design the part where the unit fact is analyzed using the deep learning prediction model as a predetermined unit. The model will also include a design for a database that determines the degree of fake news in the target content and stores the information in the identified unit factor through the analyzed unit factor."

Primarily, this book contains an integrated understanding of human nature as revealed in Scholasticism and the Spiritual Exercises. Education of Children (童幼敎育), published to educate children and meant to introduce the Western European medieval education to China, consists of educational views based on Jesuit education, as the author was a Jesuit priest. The word, ‘schola’, has two different meanings: school and leisure. From these dual meanings, a core concept came into being: the true meaning of academic study based on intellect and the apprehension of silence and contemplation. In addition, the Spiritual Exercises are closely connected to virtue by emphasizing numerous practical virtues ― examen, discerning good and evil, humility, etc. ― in accordance with ‘Indifferentia.’ As shown above, the true meaning of human nature can be well-implemented when intellect and virtue are integrated into one with their foundation, spirituality. Education of Children (童幼敎育) includes all three dimensions: the spiritual dimension that emphasizes the self-transcendence implicated in a loving relationship with God(reverence for God) and seeks a deep understanding of human beings, the intellectual dimension that underlines academic study through endless learning and deep wisdom, and the virtuous dimension that stresses practical cultivation based on ‘Indifferentia’ with the practice of various virtues. In particular, the attempt to comprehend spirituality in depth can help people understand it in a modern sense by focusing on human beings and not God. In short, Education of Children (童幼敎育), reviewed from the perspectives of Scholasticism and the Spiritual Exercises, helps us enhance the human integration of mind and value through a better understanding of the significance of integrating three aspects of human nature, although the education of today is less interested in this."

Recent work utilizes deep learning to learn the order and it shows good performance. Despite its good performance, it does not provide any explanation for prediction. The lack of explanation can occur difficulty of finding contamination of data or the vulnerability of the model itself. As a result, the users lose their reliability of the model. To address this problem, this work proposes an explainable log anomaly detection system. In this study, log parsing is the first to proceed. Afterward, sequential rules are extracted by Bayesian posterior probability. As a result, the ""If condition then results, post-probability"" type rule set is extracted. If the sample is matched to the ruleset, it is normal, otherwise, it is an anomaly. We utilize HDFS datasets for the experiment, resulting in F1score 92.7% in test dataset."

Automated 3D scoring of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a confocal whole slide imaging scanner,2021,,,"Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a technique to visualize specific DNA/RNA sequences within the cell nuclei and provide the presence, location and structural integrity of genes on chromosomes. A confocal Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanner technology has superior depth resolution compared to wide-field fluorescence imaging. Confocal WSI has the ability to perform serial optical sections with specimen imaging, which is critical for 3D tissue reconstruction for volumetric spatial analysis. The standard clinical manual scoring for FISH is labor-intensive, time-consuming and subjective. Application of multi-gene FISH analysis alongside 3D imaging, significantly increase the level of complexity required for an accurate 3D analysis. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to establish automated 3D FISH scoring for z-stack images from confocal WSI scanner. The algorithm and the application we developed, SHIMARIS PAFQ, successfully employs 3D calculations for clear individual cell nuclei segmentation, gene signals detection and distribution of break-apart probes signal patterns, including standard break-apart, and variant patterns due to truncation, and deletion, etc. The analysis was accurate and precise when compared with ground truth clinical manual counting and scoring reported in ten lymphoma and solid tumors cases. The algorithm and the application we developed, SHIMARIS PAFQ, is objective and more efficient than the conventional procedure. It enables the automated counting of more nuclei, precisely detecting additional abnormal signal variations in nuclei patterns and analyzes gigabyte multi-layer stacking imaging data of tissue samples from patients. Currently, we are developing a deep learning algorithm for automated tumor area detection to be integrated with SHIMARIS PAFQ."

With the introduction of PET and cyclotron in Korea in 1994, nuclearmedicine imaging research was further activated. With the support of large-scale government projects, the development ofgamma camera, SPECT, and PET systems was carried out. Exploiting the use of PET scanners in conjunction with cyclotrons,extensive studies on myocardial blood flow quantification and brain image analysis were also actively pursued. In 2005,Korea’s first domestic cyclotron succeeded in producing radioactive isotopes, and the cyclotron was provided to six universitiesand university hospitals, thereby facilitating the nationwide supply of PET radiopharmaceuticals. Since the late 2000s,research on PET/MRI has been actively conducted, and the advanced research results of Korean scientists in the fields ofsilicon photomultiplier PET and simultaneous PET/MRI have attracted significant attention from the academic community.Currently, Korean researchers are actively involved in endeavors to solve a variety of complex problems in nuclear medicineusing artificial intelligence and deep learning technologies."

Who are bad women? Stepmothers and witches are embodiment of bad women in children’s literature. Stepmothers are categorized by ones who have their own children and vice versa. The witch exists as a separate image. Witches are a side of a bad mother, and at the same time, they are inherent in children, so it can be said that they want to avoid it. Based on Kristeva’s concept, abject is separated from the subject and is placed between the subject and the object. In the process of growing up, children make mistakes, regret them or suffer pain, and what they learn and realize on the way to find solutions while causing conflict is the foundation for their growth. Growth is not a value that can be easily achieved or obtained. Reflective thinking must be accompanied, and deep reflection on it is required. In other words, according to Kant, that a person becomes mature means having the ability to adopt his or her own rational thinking. In the process of growth, children should confront and overcome conflicting elements including bad women so that they have positive self-awareness as well as subjectivity and self-determination. Therefore, although bad mothers' non-subjective consciousness reflected in the concept of a bad woman itself and abject, it could be paradoxically a significant factor in the growth of children."

The novel does not deviate from the typical fantasy framework, and exhibits the dichotomous, universal, and cliché themes of good and evil, and light and darkness. However, DiCamillo draws deep symbolism from the conflicting worlds of light and darkness, develops cliché themes in an interesting way, and elicits rational interpretation through an imaginative point-of-view. The dark and underground space, which is set as a fantasy space in the novel, encourages us to find fundamental problems of life and to open our eyes to the reality.The space of light is a metaphor for love and forgiveness, while darkness represents hatred and betrayal. Despereaux recognizes what the real world is, and finds clues to solving problems in a fantasy space. The main characters are also able to find their inner self and learn how to forgive each other by having empathy for other characters who are in the fantasy space of darkness. Fantasy deviates from the boredom and limitations of the real world, and seeks to maximize imagination in fantasy space. The novel follows the order and rules of fantasy framework. It thus opens up the possibility of a rational interpretation of finding true love and hope."

Advances in information processing are commonly used to quantify gigantic building activity data steps to boost the activity efficiency of the building energy systems. Here, some smart data mining models are offered to measure, and predict the time series for energy in order to expose different ephemeral principles for using energy. Such considerations illustrate the use of machines in relation to time, such as day hour, time of day, week, month and year relationships within a family unit, which are key components in gathering and separating the effect of consumers behaviors in the use of energy and their pattern of energy prediction. It is necessary to determine the multiple relations through the usage of different appliances from simultaneous information flows. In comparison, specific relations among interval-based instances where multiple appliances use continue for certain duration are difficult to determine. In order to resolve these difficulties, an unsupervised energy time-series data clustering and a frequent pattern mining study as well as a deep learning technique for estimating energy use were presented. A broad test using true data sets that are rich in smart meter data were conducted. The exact results of the appliance designs that were recognized by the proposed model were filled out by Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM and GRU) at each stage, with consolidated accuracy of 94.79%, 97.99%, 99.61%, for 25%, 50%, and 75%, respectively."

In addition, he re-established his identity by reexamining the fundamental spirit and natural aesthetics of calligraphy, and based on this, he greatly contributed to expanding the aesthetics of modern calligraphy and painting art by pursuing an aesthetic that explores novelty. In particular, Windy Bamboo painting has strong abstraction based on the principle of 'drawing the will'. And, in terms of discipline, the ethical aesthetic of Express Tao with pictures (畵以載道), which expresses the high level of elegance of observing small things in a big way, based on deep research on the logic of things and fulfilling human nature. By implementing it, Tao and Art become one. The Jeonbuk calligraphy group achieved the greatest prosperity in the Gangam era, and at the end of the 20th century, it entered a period of revival as it established itself as the central calligraphy group of Korean calligraphy."

The technique of completing a 2D puzzle has been studied a lot. However, there is a limitation in that it is difficult to effectively express objects only with 2D. We present a 2D+ Lego puzzle generation algorithm that converts an input image into a 2D Lego puzzle with several bricks that represent heights. We employ a depth map estimation scheme and a semantic segmentation scheme for our purpose. We need to properly process the depth and segmentation information of various objects to apply to the 2D+ puzzle. For this reason, we apply deep learning models to the model to extract a depth map and a segmentation map. To extract the segmentation map, we adopted BiseNet learned with CelebAMask-HQ dataset. And DenseDepth learned with NYU Depth V2 dataset was used to obtain the depth map. We downsample the input image to a low-resolutional image and arrange the color information of the image according to the color palette of the allowable Lego bricks. We build a 2D+ pixel art image by corporating the low-resolutional images with the depth map and segmentation map. 2D+ lego puzzle is constructed from this 2D+ pixel art image by applying a greedy algorithm that seeks a largest Lego brick that can fit the candidate space."

In addition, the accuracy of the Korean orthography checkers was examined by analyzing the errors that appeared in the test results. Out of the 30 spelling items, the checker Ⓐ corrected 25 items, the checker Ⓑ corrected 28 items, the checker Ⓒ corrected 23 items, and the checker Ⓓ corrected 21 items. Among the 30 vocabulary items, Ⓐ corrected 16 items, Ⓑ corrected 19 items, Ⓒ corrected 17 items, and Ⓓ corrected 15 items. In the sentence category, Ⓐ corrected 4 items, Ⓑ corrected 5 items, Ⓒ corrected 3 items, and Ⓓ corrected 4 items out of the 30 items. Based on the results, it could be confirmed that the correction rate was highest in the spelling category, but they were less accurate in the vocabulary category; they were significantly less accurate in the sentence category. In other words, the current system shows high performance in correcting simple notation errors, but it was confirmed that there is a problem in that the other errors cannot be corrected in many items because they fundamentally utilize rule-based correction and statistical correction. In order to solve this problem, it is necessary to apply machine learning techniques such as deep learning, which have been used recently in natural language processing fields such as automatic translation and chat in the field of artificial intelligence."

In this circumstance, global hospitality groups have been creating lifestyle brands in line with the latest trend. Even with the rapid growth of lifestyle brands, the concept of lifestyle hotels is still vague. Besides, lifestyle hotels, especially in South Korea, tend to be developed as multi-purpose complexes combined with retail. Therefore, lifestyle hotel experiences should be studied with broader perspectives, not solely focusing on its primary function of staying. This study aims to identify factors of lifestyle hotels by analyzing user-created content on Social Media. This research examined images and hashtags on an image-based social media: Instagram. Departing from investigating lifestyle hotel brands in South Korea based on 12,913 hashtags and 565 location analysis of 4,242 lifestyle hotel posts, the contents related to three lifestyle hotels(Hotel Cappuccino, L7, and GLAD) were analyzed. For this, a web crawler was developed with Python. A total of 84,585 hashtags and 52,707 images were analyzed using Vision AI to explore the crucial factors. The results demonstrated that design, facilities, setting, and service factors are the most influential in lifestyle hotels. Also, the lifestyle segment reflects the latest lifestyle and hospitality trends. Based on these results, this study suggests the five main categories of factors for future research: design, facilities, setting, service, and trend. Moreover, this research suggests broader uses of big data and deep learning for deriving the factors that influence the perception and evaluation of hotel spaces."

It was the beginning of so-called Sinyubakhae (Catholic Persecution of 1801), and was a strict policy aiming at the eradication of Catholicism, changing completely from edification-centered measures during King Jeongjo’s reign. For this, the Royal court took notice of oga-jaktong-beop (the system of five households in one tong) and hyangyak (village self-governing rules), and combined both of them and made geumsahak-jeolmok, which applied even to the lowest organizations of rural villages. Jeokseongbang- Hyangyak-Geumsahak-Jeolmok was issued in such a context, and is the only document currently found among jeolmoks enforced at villages in 1801. The Hyangyak-Geumsahak-Jeolmok contains not only the process of jeolmok being enforced at Jeokseong-bang according to the instruction of Bibyeonsa, but also matters such as the tracking down of Catholics through oga-tong-beop, the joint responsibility of the head of tong, and the edification of customs through hyangyak. Therefore, it is an important historical source that reveals the countermeasures of village society taken against sahak under the instruction of Bibyeonsa, as well as the Joseon government’s perception on the rejection of heterodoxy and its policy on the prohibition of Catholicism. From the review of the ‘jeolmok,’ the position of the Royal court and the response of village society can be identified in detail. The Royal court perceived Catholicism as a religion of revolution and was determined to eradicate it, breaking from the policy of edification during King Jeongjo’s reign. And the ruling class of villages also shared this perception. Thus, villages tried to autonomously enforce surveillance and control through ogajaktong in order to prevent the horizontal propagation of Catholicism and to maintain the traditional Confucian order in village society. As a result of the strict policy against Catholicism carried out by the Royal court and villages, lots of Catholics were arrested, and the spread of Catholicism was suppressed. In addition, the church was re-organized revolving around believers’ villages in mountains according as Catholics, who survived the enforcement of Hyangyak-Geumsahak-Jeolmok, fled to deep mountains and adhered to their faith. In conclusion, from Jeokseongbang-Hyangyak- Geumsahak-Jeolmok, it is possible to know the rejective perception of the Joseon’s ruling class on Catholicism as heterodoxy as well as polices against Catholicism at the time of Sinyubakhae, and also to grasp subsequent effects on the church. The present investigation of Jeokseongbang-Hyangyak- Geumsahak-Jeolmok is significant in this respect."

In the metaverse, where humans cross the real world and the virtual world, a phenomenon is occurring in which ‘digitally created virtual characters’ representing a specific human being have a human relationship with a virtual character representing another person. A cyberperson who performs reinforcement learning through deep learning like AlphaGo is developing from the level of imitating humans to the stage of self-judgment and action. Artificial intelligence is engaged in activities such as consulting on problems facing humans, joking around with themselves, and teaching knowledge based on big data. Cyberpersons, based on AI, are increasingly attractive in appearance and behavior than real humans, and outperform humans in personality. In this regard, in terms of social discipline, as the human category is expanding, the addition of ‘electronic human’ in addition to the existing ‘natural person’ and ‘corporate person’ is spreading. It is necessary to review the modern personality theory that has been built without reflecting the metaverse and cyberperson, and various follow-up studies on this are needed."

The strategy includes an active deployment of electric vechicle(EV) charging infrastructure where the role of the public is the most important. To achieve efficiency of the deployment, close estimation of the actual demand for charging electric vehicles in both temporal and spatial dimensions is very important. To respond to these policy demands, this study aims to derive a deep understanding of the spatial distribution of charging demand over time as well as policy measures for charging infrastructure based on it. A spatial model is developed using machine learning algorithm and used to forecast the spatial distribution of EV ownership between 2025 and 2035. Overall EV charging demand is estimated based on the spatial distribution of EV ownership and their trips, and the amount of charging infrastructure needed to be installed is also estimated by type and by municipality reflecting the preference of the current EV users. In particular, the estimated charging demand was high within Seoul and in other metropolitan areas for daytime work or visiting places, while the demand for residential-based slow charging was higher in suburban cities. Preferred types of charging infrastructure also differ depending on their activity characteristics and places."
코로나 이전과 이후의 4차 산업혁명과 광고의 뉴스기사 분석 : LDA와 Word2vec을 중심으로,2021,"['4차 산업혁명', '광고', '코로나 19', 'LDA', 'Word2vec', 'the 4th Industrial Revolution', 'Advertising', 'COVID 19']","4차 산업혁명이란 인공지능(AI), 사물인터넷(IoT), 로봇기술, 드론, 자율주행과 가상현실(VR) 등 정보통신 기술이 주도하는 차세대 산업혁명을 말하는 것으로, 광고 산업 발전에도 큰 영향을 미쳤다. 그러나 지금 전세계는 코로나 확산 방지를 위하여, 비접촉, 비대면 생활환경으로 급속도로 빠르게 변화하고 있다. 이에 따라 4차 산업혁명과 광고의 역할도 변화하고 있다. 따라서 본 연구에서는 코로나 19 이전과 이후의 4차산업 혁명과 광고의 변화를 살펴보기 위해 빅카인즈를 활용해서 텍스트 분석을 하였다. 코로나 19 이전인 2019년과 코로나 19 이후인 2020년을 비교하였다. LDA토픽 모형 분석과 딥러닝 기법인 Word2vec을 통해 주요 토픽과 문서분류를 하였다. 연구결과 코로나19 이전에는 정책, 콘텐츠, AI 등이 나타났으나, 코로나 이후에는 데이터를 활용한 금융, 광고, 배달 등으로 점차 영역이 확장되며, 더불어 인재양성 교육이 중요한 이슈로 나타난 것을 알 수 있었다. 또한, 코로나 19 이전에는 4차 산업혁명 기술과 관련된 광고를 활용하는 것이 주류를 이루었다면, 코로나 19 이후에는 참여, 협력, 일상 필요 등 좀 더 적극적으로 첨단기술 자체에 대한 교육과 인재양성 등에 대한 키워드가 두드러지게 나타나고 있다. 따라서 이러한 연구결과는 코로나 19 이후에 4차 산업혁명에서 광고의 나아갈 방향을 제시하면서, 이에 필요한 이론적, 실무적으로 적용할 수 있는 다각적인 전략을 제시하는 데 의의가 있다.","The 4th industrial revolution refers to the next-generation industrial revolution led by information and communication technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), robot technology, drones, autonomous driving and virtual reality (VR) and it also has made a significant impact on the development of the advertising industry. However, the world is rapidly changing to a non-contact, non-face-to-face living environment to prevent the spread of COVID 19. Accordingly, the role of the 4th industrial revolution and advertising is changing. Therefore, in this study, text analysis was performed using Big Kinds to examine the 4th industrial revolution and changes in advertising before and after COVID 19. Comparisons were made between 2019 before COVID 19 and 2020 after COVID 19. Main topics and documents were classified through LDA topic model analysis and Word2vec, a deep learning technique. As the result of the study showed that before COVID 19, policies, contents, AI, etc. appeared, but after COVID 19, the field gradually expanded to finance, advertising, and delivery services utilizing data. Further, education appeared as an important issue. In addition, if the use of advertising related to the 4th industrial revolution technology was mainstream before COVID 19, keywords such as participation, cooperation, and daily necessities, were more actively used for education on advanced technology, while talent cultivation appeared prominently. Thus, these research results are meaningful in suggesting a multifaceted strategy that can be applied theoretically and practically, while suggesting the future direction of advertising in the 4th industrial revolution after COVID 19."

These interactions, however, do not always go smooth and have potential for conflict. In order to allow for peaceful and productive interactions, it would be essential to take a look into cultures that seem alien from one’s own perspective, but also to reflect on one’s own. The aim is to develop intercultural skills that create understanding and empathy for something that is alien. In this regard, the reception of travel literature is recommended. In the history of mankind, travel has always been linked with documenting experiences so that experiences could be processed and presented. An analysis of documentation relating to intercultural encounters is therefore very useful as one can learn a lot from them. The genre of travel literature is diverse and constantly exposed to new triggers. In the age of the Internet, travel blogs have become increasingly popular and have maintained a strong position next to conventional books. Nonetheless, the combination of travel blog and interculture has barely played a role in German cultural studies to date. In particular, there is very limited coverage on Germany and South Korea which due to their deep cultural gaps could be a worthwhile and interesting topic. This article aims to close a research gap. The underlying analysis focuses on a travel blog of two Germans who are visiting South Korea in September 2019 and which examines so-called “critical incidents” where different cultural standards clash leading up to misunderstandings or even conflicts. The analysis revolves around how the protagonists in this case perceive such situations and how they respond to them. Illustrating the situation from the point of views of various different cultural standards can show how an “assumed” conflict situation can raise various possible interpretations which creates room for reinterpretation and thus allows one to build up intercultural skills."

In particular, the electric device of automobiles is accelerating technology development competition among automobile parts makers, and the development cycle is also changing rapidly. Due to these changes, the importance of strategic planning for R&D is further strengthened. Due to the paradigm shift in the automobile industry, the Product-Technical Roadmap (P/TRM), one of the R&D strategies, analyzes technology forecasting, technology level evaluation, and technology acquisition method (Make/Collaborate/Buy) at the planning stage. The product-technical roadmap is a tool that identifies customer needs of products and technologies, selects technologies and sets development directions. However, most companies are developing the product-technical roadmap through a qualitative method that mainly relies on the technical papers, patent analysis, and expert Delphi method. In this study, empirical research was conducted through simulations that can supplement and strengthen the product-technical roadmap centered on the automobile industry by fusing Gartner's hype cycle, cumulative moving average-based data preprocessing, and deep learning (LSTM) time series analysis techniques. The empirical study presented in this paper can be used not only in the automobile industry but also in other manufacturing fields in general. In addition, from the corporate point of view, it is considered that it will become a foundation for moving forward as a leading company by providing products to the market in a timely manner through a more accurate product-technical roadmap, breaking away from the roadmap preparation method that has relied on qualitative methods."

As I was teaching at the law school, I had a chance to learn how students who didn't study law in their undergraduate felt about legal terms. They say that while the legal sentences are written in Korean, they are like foreign languages. Our legal language is seriously contaminated by Japanese language. That includes not only ① the jargon itself, but ② the Japanese grammar (the passive, past, progressive tenses), ③ Japanese kanji words that are read in Japanese native language, ④ the habit of using verbs as nouns, ⑤ ambiguous expressions (including duplication of negative words), ⑥ the Japanese unique speech habits, ⑦ using unnecessary words. We have been destroying Korean language to be hard to understand or difficult to listen to. And, using words that are understood only by Chinese characters or confused with other words in Korean texts that use only Korean alphabet(Hangul) also makes our language life uncomfortable. This phenomenon, of course, is not a matter of legal language alone. However, the legal language centering on civil law has a great influence on the language life of the country. The Civil Code is a standard of living for all citizens and is the basis of other laws. So Napoleon, while in the position of emperor, participated personally as a chairman of the civil code review meeting, making it easy to understand by anyone, but also made the code in beautiful French language, loved by the people and set an example for other countries. Because Germany enacted a civil law like a textbook (Pandekten system) unlike France, it was not easy for the people to understand, but it changed all the Latin legal terms those European countries used at that time to German native words. In the process, there were cases where one word in Latin was several words in German. However, we Koreans insist on Japanese legal terms and expressions those even Japanese people think that there are problems. Our people have lived as one nation for over 1500 years. I believe that if the trial is proceeded with a word that can be easily understood by anyone who has a civil code with beautiful and easy-to-understand Korean, it can be an opportunity to promote patriotism and self-esteem. It is language that connects people with people. If it is easy to communicate within the community and the conflict can be resolved in words that touch the heart, the idea of 'us' will become more solid. In the in the process of writing judgments as a judge, legal documents as a lawyer, and teaching law as a professor, I personally realized that our legal languages are not functioning, but impede understanding of the law. I came to deeply reflect on myself. So I would like to appeal, we should pay more attention to correcting the sickness of our legal language. The purpose of this article is to correct the legal terms in the code and Supreme Court precedents, and above all, to improve the odd sentences and unnecessary words of Japanese into easy-to-understand and concise Korean. Just in early 2018, the Ministry of Justice completed an easy-to-understand revision of the Civil Code. However, it is necessary to realize that the Japanese sickness condition is very deep in Korean language and to correct into the Korean language which is not odd to the general public, but the amendment of the civil law is not satisfactory in that respect. I hope that our civil law is clear and beautiful, so that even those who major in literature can read our civil law and get inspiration. Not only us, who live in this land, but also our descendants in the future, should be proud of our law, and be able to speak law without fear in our everyday lives and law courts."
특정인에 대한 범죄예측 시스템의 문제점과 개선방안,2021,"['범죄예측 시스템', '특정인', '인공지능', '알고리즘', '범죄예방', '범죄자 예측', 'Crime Prediction System', 'specific person', 'artificial intelligence', 'algorithms', 'crime prevention', 'criminal prediction']","머신러닝 및 딥러닝 기술에 근거한 인공지능이 빅데이터라는 방대한 자료 속에서 숨겨진 정보들 간의 상관관계를 찾아내고 이를 바탕으로 미래에 어떤 일이 발생할 것인지를 통계적으로 예측하고 있다. 이를 활용하여 사회의 많은 분야에서 상당히 높은 수준의 예측을 하고 있다. 이러한 높은 예측력은 범죄예방분야에서도 활용되고 있는데, 이미 선진국에서는 범죄발생률이 높은 대도시를 중심으로 빅 데이터와 인공지능을 이용한 범죄예측 시스템을 도입함으로써 범죄율이 감소하는 등 가시적인 효과를 보고 있다. 이러한 범죄예측 시스템의 방법은 범죄 예측, 범죄 피해자 예측, 범죄자 예측 등 크게 3가지로 구분할 수 있다. 특정한 범죄자와 피해자와 같은 특정인의 범죄를 전망하는 범죄자 예측과 피해자 예측은 개인의 Privacy가 침해된다는 점과 민감한 개인정보의 수집 범위가 제한적이라는 점에서 연구 및 활용이 제한되었다. 이 때문에 범죄예측 시스템은 장소별, 지역별 범죄 위험도를 기반으로 한 범죄발생의 시간과 장소를 전망하는 시공간 범죄예측이 주를 이루고 있다. 이러한 상황에서 본 연구는 특정인에 대한 범죄예측 시스템에서 발생할 수 있는 문제점을 제기하고 이에 대한 신속한 대처방안을 모색하는데 목표를 두고자 한다. 특정인에 대한 범죄예측 시스템은 특정인의 개인정보를 다루기 때문에 필연적으로 헌법상 보장된 사생활의 비밀과 자유 및 개인정보자기결정권 등의 기본권을 침해할 수밖에 없다. 특정인을 대상자로 할 경우 일반인과의 형평성의 문제가 제기될 수 있다. 또한 대상범죄를 어느 범위까지 허용할 것인지 명확한 한계를 설정하기 어렵다. 범죄예측 시스템에 사용되는 인공지능 알고리즘은 불명투명성, 편향성, 부정확성의 문제가 있다. 인공지능 알고리즘의 불투명성은 부정확한 범죄예측으로 인한 피해나 그 책임의 소재를 찾는데 어려움을 줄 수 있다. 또한 인공지능 알고리즘이 지닌 잠재적 편향성과 부정확성 때문에 범죄예측이 공정하지 못하다는 비판을 받고 있다. 그리고 범죄예측 시스템은 시민들에게 새로운 통제수단이 되고 있다. 이러한 문제점을 해결하기 위해서는 먼저, 개인정보보호법 제15조 1항 1호에 의해 정보주체의 사전 동의를 반드시 받도록 하여야 할 것이다. 범죄예측을 위한 특정인에 대한 개인정보수집은 합목적적 범위 내에서 필요최소한에 그쳐야 할 것이고, 잘못된 결과가 발생할 경우를 회피 내지 개선할 수 있는 적당한 조치를 사전에 보장하여야 한다. 모든 개인정보수집은 감독기관의 적절한 감독을 받을 것을 보장하여야 한다. 알고리즘의 불투명성을 해결하는 방법으로는 정보 주체나 일반인을 대신하여 알고리즘의 적절성을 심사하고 감시하는 조직이나 기관을 설치하는 방법을 제시할 수 있다. 편향성 및 부정확성 해결방안으로 범죄예측 시스템을 통한 범죄예방의 효과성이 입증되어 공개되어야 하며 범죄예측 시스템의 알고리즘의 정확성이 담보되어야 할 것이다. 범죄예측 시스템의 적용대상범죄와 대상자의 선정을 위해서는 재범의 중대성과 위험성이 중요한 판단 기준이 될 것이다. 범죄예측 시스템을 사용한 범죄예측은 살인, 강도, 강간, 방화와 같은 중대범죄여야 할 것이다. 범죄예측 시스템이 시민에 대한 통제장치로서 악용될 우려를 불식시키기 위해서는 범죄예측 시스템도 보안처분과 같이 비례성의 원칙에 의하여 대상자의 권리침해를 최소화하여야 한다. 범죄예측 시스템은 형벌이나 다른 보안처분에 의하여 목적을 달성할 수 없는 최후수단으로서 사용되어야 할 것이다. 대상자의 재범위험성을 근거로 개별적으로 사용하여야 한다. 범죄예측시스템은 행정처분에 의하여 행해져서는 안되고 법원의 사법심사에 의하여 부과되어야 한다.","Artificial intelligence based on machine learning and deep learning technology finds correlations between hidden information in the vast data of big data and statistically predicts what will happen in the future. Using AI, there are high-level predictions in many fields of society. This high predictive power of AI is also being used in the field of crime prevention. In developed countries, crime prediction systems using big data and artificial intelligence have been introduced intensively in large cities with high crime rates. And they are producing tangible effects such as a decrease in the crime rate. The methods of such a crime prediction system can be broadly divided into 3 categories: ① crime prediction, ② criminal prediction, ③ crime victim prediction. Because of the limited scope of collection of sensitive personal information and protection of personal privacy, crime prediction, which predicts the time and place of a crime based on the crime risk by region and location, is mainly used rather than predicting criminals and victims. In this situation, the purpose of this study is to raise the problems that may appear in the crime prediction system for a specific person and to find a quick response method. Therefore, in this study, the problem of infringement of individual constitutional and legal rights that may occur when the crime prediction system is used for a specific person, the problem of opacity, inaccuracy and bias of the algorithm of the crime prediction system, and the problem of the crime prediction system as a new control means. We will review the potential problems and seek solutions to them. Since the crime prediction system for a specific person deals with the personal information of a specific person, it inevitably violates the basic rights such as privacy and freedom and the right to self-determination of personal information guaranteed by the Constitution. When targeting a specific person, the issue of equity with the general public may be raised. In addition, it is difficult to set clear limits on the extent to which target crimes are permitted. Artificial intelligence algorithms used in crime prediction systems have problems of opacity, bias, and inaccuracy. The opacity of artificial intelligence algorithms can make it difficult to find the cause of damage or responsibility due to inaccurate crime prediction. In addition, due to the potential bias and inaccuracy of artificial intelligence algorithms, crime prediction is being criticized for being unfair. And the crime prediction system is becoming a new means of control for citizens. In order to solve this problem, it is necessary to first obtain the prior consent of the information subject according to Article 15 (1) 1 of the Personal Information Protection Act. The collection of personal information for a specific person for crime prediction should be limited to the minimum necessary within the scope of the purpose of the crime, and appropriate measures to avoid or improve the occurrence of erroneous results should be ensured in advance. It should be ensured that all personal information collection is subject to appropriate supervision by the supervisory authority. As a method of solving the opacity of the algorithm, it can be suggested to establish an organization or institution that examines and monitors the adequacy of the algorithm on behalf of the data subject or the general public. As a solution to bias and inaccuracy, the effectiveness of crime prevention through the crime prediction system should be proven and disclosed, and the accuracy of the crime prediction system algorithm should be guaranteed. The seriousness and risk of recidivism will be an important criterion for the selection of target crimes and targets for the crime prediction system. Crime prediction using the crime prediction system should be serious crimes such as murder, robbery, rape,"

In addition, the progress of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, represented by intelligence, and the forced introduction of non-face-to-face due to Covid-19 are accelerating the application of ICT applied services to existing offline industries. In particular, museums that will be mainly covered in this study have become places of avoidance due to shutdowns or social distancing. In addition, at the end of the dark tunnel, the era of New-Normal where digital has become commonplace will be in an environment where visitors cannot be treated in the same way as before. These changes are not sudden, but continuous flows, and the introduction speed has only been accelerated due to Covid-19. Therefore, it is essential for museums to provide realistic exhibitions, communication with visitors, and fun factors to enhance visitor satisfaction and revisit by introducing online services. In this study, some methods are proposed to increase the interest and satisfaction of visitors by developing and proposing a technology that provides online experience factors related to exhibition artworks in real time by applying NST, a method of deep learning of an image conversion network using content image and style image as inputs based on a pre-trained model."

In particular, data collection combining new technologies such as cloud and artificial intelligence is considered an essential element in nurturing new industries. The collection and utilization of personal medical data is expected to play a role in a new industry. However, there has always been a problem of protection due to the possibility of personal medical data being personal information and possibly sensitive information. The Personal Information Protection Act of Korea has served as a fort for the protection of personal information, but it is also true that the reaction hinders the use of personal medical data. In recent years, the so-called Data 3 Law has been revised, creating new opportunities for the use of personal medical data. The U.S. government regulates the free use of pseudonymous data when it comes to medical data. On the other hand, the possibility of personal information infringement is reduced by clarifying the limitations of the use of pseudonymous data in accordance with FTC's three-part de-identification test. Korea's Personal Information Protection Act stipulates that re-identification of pseudonym information is prohibited, just like the U.S. In order to prevent personal information from being infringed, it is necessary to keep a close eye on the current status of the U.S. legislative trends and working-level guidelines."
Manually scaling ionograms measured by Icheon and Jeju ionosondes over a 2-year period (2017–2018),2021,['Ionososphere · Ionosonde · Ionogram · Automatic scaling · Manual scaling'],,"From 1966 until 2009, the ionosonde at the Anyang station has been monitoring the ionosphere over the Korea, Peninsula, and the ionosondes at the Icheon (37.14° N, 127.54° E) and the Jeju (33.43° N, 126.30° E) stations have continued their monitoring missions since 2010 and 2009, respectively. An ionosonde transmits HF radio waves vertically and records the waves reflected from the ionosphere on an ionogram. Ionospheric parameters, such as foF2 (the critical frequency of the F2 layer) and hmF2 (the peak height of the F2 layer), can be extracted from an ionogram using an automatic scaling program.However, an automatic scaling program may result in absurdly inaccurate ionospheric parameters. In this study, we manually scaled total 33,679 ionograms measured at the Icheon and the Jeju ionosondes for 2 years (2017 and 2018). By adopting the manual scaling method from the standard handbook of Wakai et al. (Radio Research Laboratory, Ministry of Posts and Telecommunication, Japan, 1987), we extracted five ionospheric parameters, namely foF2, hmF2, foE (the critical frequency of the E layer), hmE (the peak height of the E layer), and foEs (the critical frequency of the sporadic E layer), and compared them with the automatically scaled values obtained by using ARTIST5002 (the built-in automatic scaling program). We found that the automatic scaling software misinterpreted about 23% and 36% the ionograms taken at the Icheon and the Jeju stations, respectively, thus inaccurately characterizing both the ionospheric E and F layers. We classified those misinterpreted ionograms into eight cases: five cases about the F layer and three cases about the E layer. We discuss the reliability of automatically scaled parameters, emphasizing the need for manual scaling when scientifically investigating the ionosphere with ionosonde data. The manually scaled parameters can be used as “true” values when a deep learning model is trained to interpret measured ionograms."

In order to achieve the object of this study, researchers examined the case of media literacy education already being implemented in university general education. Based on the results of this study, the following may be noted: First, this study presented the media literacy curriculum systematically, and an analysis was made based on various theoretical studies. Secondly, the student’s perception of media literacy in the beginning of the lecture was checked through a Preliminary survey. Most students were not fully aware of the concept of media literacy, had low understanding of media, and were lacking in their ability to cope with problems of digital media, such as “fake news” and the practice of the “deep fake.” Thirdly, through the focus group interview(FGI) we learned that students’ attitude and perceptions were changed to an enhanced extent after 15 weeks of being enrolled in the curriculum. Most students’ understanding, analytical skills, and critical ability of media seem to have grown significantly. Finally, this study analyzed the effects found among students from their studies after being enrolled in the curriculum for 15 weeks, and presented plans to activate ‘media literacy and creative communication’ among the students as a effective curriculum model of liberal arts. Through this it is hoped that students can develop core competencies of media, such as an ability to properly approach media, and to improve their critical understanding capabilities, as well as their socio-cultural participation capabilities."

Radar-based automatic incident detectors are expensive and require a separate closed circuit television (CCTV) camera to detect and monitor traffic abnormalities. Despite these detector can identify vehicles and pedestrians, they have difficulty detecting other objects such as motorcycles, bicycles, and falling objects. In the case of the camera based automatic incident detectors, it is difficult to provide a real-time service because the CCTV image is transferred to the video analysis server of the C-ITS center which recognizes traffic hazards, whereby the hazard information is then provided to the driver. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an edge camera based real-time road hazard recognition and information provision system. The edge camera recognizes an object through image processing locally, determines a danger situation, and provides danger information to the driver through the roadside unit (RSU). The proposed system uses a lightweight deep learning network for real-time processing and performs local optimization to improve accuracy. In addition, the communication interface between the edge camera and RSU is designed so that the existing C-ITS application standard protocol can be used without modification. Experimental results show that traffic objects are accurately recognized and drives were able to be informed of road hazard situations in real time within 100ms."

With taking the aims of vocational education, Snedden emphasizes the bureaucratic and utilitarian efficiency, while Dewey seriously focused his attention on the educational efficiency of enabling learners to determine their vocational fates for themselves. Getting into the present century, the nature of works is significantly altered and complicated, and accordingly, it becomes necessary to newly establish a reasonably liberal view of vocation. The vocational view may be refined so deep and inclusive that one could understand, accommodate and properly control the variety and potentialities of the changing vocational world. This is continuous with the Deweyan view of vocational education. That is, the clue of escaping the present educational difficulties is to progressively and liberally restructure the method and contents of instruction in schools by utilizing various forms of social vocational callings as educational materials such that their intellectual and moral bearings could show themselves. The required educational restructuring is not to directly represent the existent industrial conditions in order that students make specialized vocational preparations, but to employ such conditions as learning materials while richly flourishing meanings of school life and liberating the spirit of students. The liberal vocational education should not be considered as means of securing future specialized professions, or perpetuating the existent social regime. It may involve acquiring the historical knowledge of the present problematic situations, scientifically training the needed technical and intellectual skills, and studying and discussing economical, civic, and political issues concerning the problems of the times."

To this, the study set up a universal concept of hanbae through its etymological and conceptual reviews and examined the grounds that can establish it as an instructional concept for Korean music. Based on the result of the examination, the study discussed educational implications centering on the necessity and appropriateness of introducing hanbae as an educational concept and set up the educational concept of hanbae. As a result of examining the concepts of hanbae in various literature, it was found that hanbae was closely related to its meaning ‘a shot arrow reaches the target’ in archery and was of deep origin. In music, it is used in various concepts such as tempo, a cycle of jangdan, jangdan, siga(時價), and rhythmic patterns, and there are cases where it is described in multi-purpose. Thus, on the basis of these findings, ‘tempo’ was selected as the universal concept of hanbae. There have been cases where hanbae is written as ‘한배(hanbae)’ and ‘한 배(han bae)’, but it turned out that the spacing of the words was an error. When using hanbae in general, it is considered adequate to describe as ‘the hanbae of a given piece is slow or fast.’ When explaining in terms of jangdan, it is suggested to describe a long-jandan pattern as ‘hanbae is long, and that means slow.’ Hanbae, which has the meaning of length, is a concept that accurately recognizes tempos in Jeongganbo, the Korean traditional music notation system, and understands tempos based on jangdan. Thus, it was revealed that it is appropriate to introduce the system of Jeongganbo into standardized school education. The educational concept of hanbae was set as ‘a term indicating the fast or slow degree of Korean music’ based on the universal concept. Since hanbae requires instruction through jangdan, it was suggested to explain further that ‘generally, one can learn hanbae through jangdan.’ This study focused on constructing the universal concept and the educational concept through the exemplary usages of hanbae. With the findings of this study as a theoretical basis, it is expected that further studies on specific teaching systems and corresponding teaching plans should be conducted."

In particular, the intrinsic parameters of the camera and re-projection errors were provided to quantify the accuracy of the calibration result. Three lenses of the camera capture the same image, but they are not overlapped, and the image resolution is worse than the one captured by the RGB camera. In computer vision, camera calibration is one of the most important and fundamental tasks to calculate the distance between camera (s) and a target object or the three-dimensional (3D) coordinates of a point in a 3D object. Once calibration is complete, the intrinsic and the extrinsic parameters of the camera(s) are provided. The intrinsic parameters are composed of the focal length, skewness factor, and principal points, and the extrinsic parameters are composed of the relative rotation and translation of the camera(s). This study estimated the intrinsic parameters of thermal cameras that have three lenses of different perspectives.

유신치하와 5·18 광주 민중항쟁 전후의 한 · 독 개신교 에큐메니컬 협력과 김대중 구명운동,2021,"['한국 개신교', '민주화운동', '한 · 독에큐메니컬 협력', '한국기독교교회협의회(NCCK)', 'WCC(세계교회협의회)', '유신체제', '5·18 광주 민중항쟁', '김대중 구명운동', '도로테아 슈바이처', '파울슈나이스', '갈릴리교회', 'Korean Protestantism', 'democracy movement', 'korean-german ecumenical cooperation', 'National Council of Churches in Korea(NCCK)', 'WCC(World Council of Churches)', 'Dorothea Schweizer', 'Paul Schneiss', 'Gallili Church', 'The Presbyterian Chruch in the Republic of Korea(PROK)', 'Yushin System', 'May 18 Uprising in Gwangju', 'Kim Dae-jung']","한국의 인권운동과 민주화운동은 1970년대와 80년대에 독일 및 세계교회와의 에큐메니컬 협력을 통해 큰 힘을 얻었다. 에큐메니컬 정보 네트워킹은 국내의 인권상황을 신속하게 해외에 알리는 역할을 함으로써 국제사회로부터 독재정권에 대한 정치적 압박을 효과적으로 행사할 수 있었다. 또한 기층 민중의 생존권을 보장하고, 주민들의 비판적인 정치의식을 고양시켜 그들을 조직화하는 데 기여한 각종 연구 및 교육프로그램들은 독일교회의 지속적이고 다양한 재정지원이 없었으면 수행이 대단히 어려웠을 것이다. 또한 진보적인 지식인들의 반독재 정치투쟁도 수감된 인사들과 해직교수 가족들에 대한 재정지원을 통해 그들의 고통을 덜어주지 않았더라면 장기적인 투쟁을 벌여나갈 수 없었을 것이다.  그러나 한 · 독간의 에큐메니컬 협력은 결코 일방적인 수혜관계가 아니었음을 주목할 필요가 있다. 도로테아 슈바이처는 한국교회의 인권운동과 민주화투쟁을 이끌었던 성직자들과 교수들 그리고 사회운동가들이 극심한 탄압 속에서도 굴하지 않는 용기와 신앙을 보여준 것에 감동받았으며, 독일교회와 기독교인들이 배워야 한다고 증언했다. 안병무 · 서남동 · 박형규 · 김관석 등 그가 가까이 알고 지냈던 한국 친구들의 헌신적인 투쟁을 가까이서 보지 않았더라면 슈나이스는 그렇게 열정적으로 한국의 민주화운동을 돕지 않았을지도 모른다. 민중신학에 대한 독일교회와 신학자들의 관심과 경의는 여러 권의 민중신학 소개서들이 출간되었고 하이델베르그 대학에서 민중신학에 대한 강의가 개설된 것을 통해서도 확인할 수 있다.  70년대 초까지만 해도 한국의 기독교에 별 관심이 없던 독일인들은 유신체제에 대한 진보적인 한국 기독교 인사들의 헌신적 투쟁에 관심을 갖기 시작했다. 결정적인 전기를 가져온 것은 1976년 3월 1일의 민주구국선언사건이었다. 구속된 18명의 기독교 인사들의 석방을 위한 독일교회의 광범위하고 적극적인 구명운동과 구속자 가족을 돕기 위한 모금운동이 전개되었다.  당시 김대중과 함께 구속되었던 이해동 목사는 이 사건을 정치인 김대중과 재야세력을 묶어준 중대한 의미를 가진 사건이라고 규정지었다. 이것을 김대중 구명운동과 관련하여 덧붙인다면 이 사건은 김대중을 한국 기독자민주동지회의 네트워크에 연결시킨 사건이기도 했다. 이미 1975년까지 김관석 · 지명관 · 김용복 · 오재식 등으로 구성된 민주화운동정보 네트워크가 WCC의 지원 하에 세계적인 네트워크로 확장되었고, 여기에 아주 탁월한 메신저로서 독일인 선교사 슈나이스가 가담함으로써 국내의 한국 민주화운동을 지원하는 환상적인 해외 정보 및 지원 네트워크가 갖춰졌다. 1980년 광주 민중항쟁과 이른바 ‘김대중 내란음모사건’ 이후 5월 광주에 대한 해외에서의 연대와 김대중 구명운동은 이 네트워크를 기반으로 효율적으로 이루어질 수 있었다.","The human rights movement and democratization movement in Korea gained great strength in the 1970s and 80s through ecumenical cooperation with German and international churches. Ecumenical Information Networking was able to effectively exert political pressure on the dictatorship from the international community by quickly notifying the human rights situation in Korea to overseas. In addition, the various research and educational programs that have contributed to securing the right to live among the lower classes and organizing them by raising critical political consciousness of the residents would have been very difficult without the continuous and diverse financial support of the German church.  In addition, the anti-dictatorship political struggle of progressive intellectuals would not have been possible for a long-term struggle if they had not relieved their suffering through financial support for the political prisoners and the families of dismissed professors. However, it is worth noting that the ecumenical cooperation between Korea and Germany was never a one-sided beneficiary relationship. The German missionary Dorothhea Schweitzer was touched by the courage and faith of the pastors, professors, and social activists who led the Korean church""s human rights movement and struggle for democracy, despite intense oppression, and testified that German churches and Christians should learn from this courage and faith of the Koreans. If he hadn""t seen the devoted struggles of Korean friends he had known close to, such as Ahn Byung-moo, Seonam-dong, Park Hyung-gyu, and Kim Kwan-seok, another German pastor Paul Schneiss might not have been so passionately helping the democratization movement in Korea. German churches and theologians expressed deep interest and respect for Korean Minjung Theology.  Germans, who had little interest in Korean Christianity until the early 1970s, began to take interest in the devoted struggle of progressive Korean Christians against the Yushin system. It was the Declaration of Democracy on March 1, 1976 that brought the decisive momentum. The German Church""s extensive and active life-saving campaign for the release of 18 arrested Christians and a fundraising campaign to help the political prisoner""s families took place.  Pastor Lee Hae-dong, who was arrested with Kim Dae-jung at the time, defined the case as an event of great significance that united the politician Kim Dae-jung and the “Jaeyaseryeok”(opponent forces). If you add this in connection with the Kim Dae-jung lifesaving movement, this incident was also the case that linked Kim Dae-jung to the network of the Korean Christian Democratic Comrades. Until 1975, the democratization movement information network consisting of Kim Kwan-seok, Ji Myung-gwan, Kim Yong-bok, and Oh Jae-sik was expanded to a global network under the support of the WCC, and German missionary Schneiss joined the network as a very excellent messenger to support the Korean democratization movement in Korea. It became a fantastic overseas information and support network. After the 1980 Kwangju People""s Uprising and the so-called “Kim Dae-jung Civil Conspiracy Incident”, solidarity with Gwangju in May and the Kim Dae-jung life-saving campaign could be efficiently implemented based on this network."

It is a metaphor that explains all Buddhas emergence on the world[一大事因緣] stained with five defilements[五濁惡世] to edify sentient beings of different learning abilities. Within the process, the truth[圓敎] is revealed through expedient means[藏敎, 通敎, 別敎].There are two meanings in ‘Fire’ in the parable of the Burning House and the Three Vehicles, one is fundamental, and another is the metaphoric meaning. The fundamental meaning of the ‘Fire[火]’ is that it is burning. In detail, the ‘Burning Fire’ is separated into ‘a Fire that Burns[能燒]’ and ‘a fire that is burned by the fire [所燒]’. ‘The Fire that Burns’ makes the ‘hot agony’ by burning the Five desires[五慾] and the Three poisons[三毒] of greediness, anger, and foolishness. ‘The fire that is burned by the fire’ is the suffering of birth, old age, sickness, and death occurred by ‘the fire that burns’. The fire makes the hot agony and the suffering.The metaphoric meaning of the fire is described in two ways. ‘The fire that is burned by the fire[所燒]’ is used as a metaphor for the retribution of rebirth in the six realms of existence. ‘The fire that Burns[能燒]’ is used as a metaphor for the agony. The three poisons[三毒] occurred by the five precepts[色聲香味觸] are ‘the fire that Burns[能燒]’ that triggers all of the agony. The suffering from this agony, the suffering of birth, old age, sickness, and death are described as ‘the fire that is burned by the fire[所燒].’ In other words, eight sufferings[生苦ㆍ老苦ㆍ病苦ㆍ死苦ㆍ 愛別離苦ㆍ怨憎會苦ㆍ求不得苦ㆍ五陰盛苦]. are the ‘the fire that is burned by the fire[所燒].’ The five defilements[命濁ㆍ衆生濁ㆍ煩惱濁ㆍ見濁ㆍ劫濁] are ‘the fire that Burns[能燒].’ Likewise, in the parable of the Burning House and the Three Vehicles, the deep meaning of ‘fire’ is ‘the Five Defilements and the Eight Sufferings [五濁八苦].’Agony[煩惱] and Karma[業] are the cause of Suffering[苦]. Agony is the Three poisons[三毒] and the Three kinds of Delusions[三惑]. The remedy of overcoming the causes of Suffering that is suggested by the Tiantai sect, is the practice of Three Ways of Contemplation[三觀]. Three Ways of Contemplation are insight of emptiness [空觀], insight of pro-visionality[假觀], and insight of the middle[中道觀]. These three ways of contemplation defeat three kinds of delusions which are the illusion of thinking and desire[見思惑], the illusion arising from attachment[塵沙惑], and the illusion arising from ignorance[無明惑]. Karma, the karmic actions of body, speech, and mind[三業], causes three obstacles[三障] of afflictions, karma, and suffering that leads to the formation of twelve Nidanas. Sufferings caused by twelve Nidanas are also could be defeated through the practice of Three Ways of Contemplation.Meanwhile, suffering is described as the illusion of thinking and desire[見思惑] and the illusion arising from ignorance[無明惑] in the sutras of Mahayana and Hinayana. Especially, in Srimaladvi-simhanada-Sutra(『勝鬘經』), the suffering is described as five entrenchments of affliction[五住地惑] which is further classified as associative ignorance[相應無明] and non-associative ignorance[不相應無明]. Tiantai Zhiyi(天台 智顗) reflects this understanding in his writing Fahwa Wenju(『法華文句』). Also, in his another writing, Fahwa Xuanyi(『法華玄義』), the agony is coordinated with the Four kinds of the Four Truths[四種四諦]. Three kinds of delusions[見思惑·塵沙惑·無明惑] are related to the Four Truths as arising and perishing[生滅四諦], the Four Truths as non-arising[無生四諦], the Four Truths as immeasurable[無量四諦], and the Four Truths as spontaneous[無作四諦]. By doing so, all suffering is extinguished by the Three Ways of Contemplation[三觀]. The practice of Perfect Doctrine[圓敎] is the Threefold Contemplations in a Single Mind[一心三觀].The Agony in the Chapter on Simile and Parable of the Lotus Sutra is showing its acceptance of the illusion of thinking and desire[見思惑] and the illusion arising from ignorance[無明惑] from the sutras of Mahayana and Hinayana. Specifically, the illusion of thinking and desire is explained in detail as the ten fundamental earthly desires[十使] that are five delusive inclinations[五鈍使] and five false views[五利使]. The distinct feature of agony explained in the Lotus Sutra is that it has contained all different types of agony that appear from the whole Buddhist Sutras by using the Four kinds of the Four Truths[四種四諦]. The Four kinds of the Four Truths are also suggesting the practice method.The purpose of the parable of the Burning House and the Three Vehicles is at liberating sentient beings, living in the world stained with five defilements, from the suffering caused by the hot agony. The method of liberating sentient beings is suggested in series of stages according to the learning ability of each sentient being. Start by three vehicles of expedient means and then sentient beings use the single Buddha-vehicle to pursue the All-knowing knowledge of Buddha[一切種智]."

As everyone knows, the clan of Nammyeong School in the Gangwoo area underwent clan-wide conversion in the 18th century after losing their power following King Injo s enthronement. Jeonam s family supported the Noron in the Nakhak line. His teacher was Miho Kim Won-haeng(1702~1772) that had enormous influence on the government and the people those days, which maybe explains the lack of records in his Jeonamjip to connect him with the Gangwoo area. It only contains some Chinese poems he wrote to depict the Geochang area where he moved in his latter days including Hambyeokru of Hapcheon and Chokseokru of Jinju. Even though the collection consists of eight books and four volumes, it mentions no names of Gangwoo scholars. Jeonam made constant efforts to lead a life of finding rightness and devoting to practice according to instructions of his teacher. This life attitude meant that he kept his mind in the right state based on respect so that he would not neglect or go easy on any moment in daily life. The logic behind it is simple and clear; the natural law is not far and high away but dwells in trivial things of daily life, asking any learning scholars to find this rightness in very small things of daily life and devote themselves to its practice. This tendency and awareness was revealed in Jeonam s works. Good examples are found in his Chinese poems. Jeonam s Chinese poems boast rich diversity both in content and form. In terms of content, many of his Chinese poems are reminiscent poems involving historical figures and events as he had the consciousness of a classical scholar deep inside him as an intellectual out of office and showed much interest in the history of China and Joseon. In terms of form, he made use of various expressive techniques including Sumieum and Uijak to exert his imagination. Learning about the historical situations before and after Byeongjahoran and reading many different books about them, in particular, he exercised his profound insight into this world under the influence of his social intercourse with his teachers and alumni in Seoul and Gyeonggi from his lifelong residence in Gangwoo. This is his tendency differentiating him from any other intellectuals out of office in the Gangwoo region."

In this article, we conducted research on Horse Trappings such as bits and stirrups, which were relatively unnoticed in past research on Troitskoe culture. The first purpose of this article is to improve understanding of the Horse Trappings of Troitskoe culture. And the second purpose is to identify characteristic aspects through comparison with Balhae.  First, we proceed with the analysis of form and cultural effection. It was mainly compared to data from South Siberia and grasslands in Central Asia. In addition, cultural characteristics of nomadic culture were identified in both bits and stirrups.   In order to learn more about the characteristics, it was compared and analyzed with the Saripa tombs, Daehaemeng relic, and Dongcheong tombs where similar patterns were identified in Balhae.  Formal commonalities have been found in short handle stirrups and ring stirrups. However, a big difference can be seen in the existence of three-bar bits, ringed plate bits, and stirrups with wooden frames. In order to understand the meaning of this difference, we also tried comparative analysis on other factors other than Horse Trappings.  Among the three sites, the Saripa tombs were the most similar. Not only is it similar in the Horse Trappings, but it is most similar to Troitskoye culture through comparisons of burial methods such as wooden structures and cremation, characteristic decorations of deep bowl pottery, and Turkic belt ornament.  Comparisons with Daehaemeng relic showed similarities in Turkic ornaments, circular ‘Mohe type plaques’ belt ornaments, and Troitsky ‘daggers’. However, there is a big difference that the three-bar bits has not been excavated from the Troitskoye culture. This phenomenon is attributed to the influence of the occupation layer of the Han Dynasty before Balhae.  In comparison with the Dongcheong tombs, it was found that the short handle stirrups had something in common. However, there is a big difference between the existence of ringed plate bits and stirrups with wooden frames. Unlike Troitskoye culture, this type of stirrup and bits are regarded as a region of the Korean Peninsula, including Goguryeo. Analysis of the characteristics of the main types of tombs and pottery shows that the Dongcheong tombs were Balhae tombs, which maintained a relatively strong tradition of Goguryeo.  Prior studies of the Troitskoye culture have mainly focused on pottery. Therefore, the meaning of this study can be found in that it analyzed features centered on the Horse Trappings."
<初等作文法 >의 虛詞說에 대한 검토와 이해 (1) : 名詞類부터 副詞類까지를 대상으로,2021,"['원영의', '초등작문법', '한문문법서', '문법교육', '허사론', 'Won Yeong-ui', 'Elementary Composition', 'Chinese grammar book', 'grammar education', 'preposition theory']","본고는 元泳義(1852~1928)가 편술한 初等作文法 의 虛詞論을 검토하고 그 의미와 의의를 탐구한 논문이다. 알려진 바와 같이 元泳義는 近代初期의 한학자이자 교육자이며, 그가 활동했던 시기는 대한제국기와 일제시기에 걸쳐 있기에 그의 학문과 교육의 발자취 역시 과도기적인 성격을 가진다. 본고에서 다루는 초등작문법 역시, 유년기의 학생들에게도 한학적 소양이 필요하다는 생각과, 새로운 교육제도에 맞게 보다 근대적인 방법의 문법서가 필요하다는 요구가 맞물려 지어진 책이라 할 수 있다. 그가 쓴 초등작문법 은 이렇게 근대적인 의미의 우리나라 최초의 한문 문법서라는 의의로 인해, 그 저작 배경과 의의 및 그 품사론에 대한 연구가 진행된 바 있다. 그런데 본서에는 이러한 품사론뿐만 아니라, 한문의 어세나 뉘앙스를 전달하는 虛詞에 대한 논의도 풍부하게 수록되어 있기에 주목되는 바가 있다. 주지하듯이 한문학습에 있어서 허사는 그 글의 의미와 문맥을 파악하는 중요한 요소라 할 수 있다. 물론 본서와 비견되는 이종린의 文章體法 역시 ｢虛字法｣이라고 해서 허사에 대한 내용을 싣고 있지만, 이종린의 ｢虛字法｣은 中國의 자료를 번역한 것이기에 독창성의 결여라는 한계를 가진다. 이에 비해 원영의의 허자설과 그 예문에는 특별히 외부의 자료를 참조한 흔적이 보이지 않는다. 특히 원영의는 자신이 직접 작문한 것을 본서의 예문으로 삼았는데, 이는 자유롭게 작문을 할 만큼 그의 한문 실력이 文理의 측면에서 통달하고 있음을 반증한다 하겠다. 虛字 혹은 虛詞說에 대한 부분은 본서의 【副詞】 및 【接續詞】, 【轉詞】, 【止詞】 등의 항목에 나온다. 그 중에서 정도의 크기를 ‘最(가장: 高等)/ 頗(제법: 次等)/ 僅(겨우: 低等)’으로 나누어 그 차이를 설명하는 것은 오늘날의 한문교육에도 적용시킬 만하다고 생각된다. 아울러 ‘然’이나 ‘然而’와 같은 역접의 접속사를 설명함에 있어 ‘轉詞 文句의 轉字가 有이 一種 機器가 輪軸을 全憑旋轉야 活動을 得과 如니(轉詞는 문구에 轉字가 있음이 어떤 기계가 바퀴축에 의지해 회전해서 활동을 얻음과 같으니)’라고 한 것처럼, 두 개의 문장이 서로 상반되는 사실을 뜻하는 역접의 의미를 직감적으로 표현하는 독창성이 눈에 띈다. 이외에도 본서에는 虛詞에 관한 다양한 내용이 있는데, 이러한 특징은 본서의 虛詞說이 그가 살았던 당대 뿐만 아니라 100여 년이 지난 오늘날에도 유효한 의미를 가진다는 것을 의미한다. 주지하다시피 중등 및 고등 한문교육에 있어 虛詞의 교육은 일종의 난제라 할 수 있기에 이에 대한 연구는 현재에도 지속적으로 이루어지고 있다. 省齋 柳重敎(1832~1893)의 문하에서 한학을 익히고, 터득한 文理를 가지고 근대적 문법에 접목한 원영의의 허사설은 현재의 허사교육 및 학습에 있어 도움을 줄 만한 자료가 되리라 생각한다.","This study is to examine 虛詞論 in 初等作文法 written by 元泳義 (1852~1928) and to explore the meaning and value of it. As it was known, 元泳義 was a Classical Chinese scholar and educator in the beginning of modern times. Since the time he was actively involved with the works was coincided with Korean modern times and Japanese colonial times, it had the characteristics of transition in terms of academic works and education. It seemed that the purpose of 初等作文法 was to raise Classical Chinese academic ability and to require the modern grammar book to follow the new education trend. His 初等作文法 was the first Chinese literature grammar book in Korea. There were some research about the backgrounds, meanings, and parts of speech. However, this study was about parts of speech and the discussion of 虛詞 which conveyed the tone of speech as well as nuance. In terms of study in Chinese literature, 虛詞 is the important part in understanding of the meaning and context. 文章體法 , which was comprable to 初等作文法 , written by Lee Jonglin was the ｢虛字法｣ and had the contents of 虛詞. Since ｢虛字法｣ written by Lee Jonglin was just the translation of Chinese materials, therefore, there was the lack of the originality. However, 虛詞論 written by 元泳義 did not refer to other external materials. Espeically, 元泳義 took the example from his original writing and it showed that his level of Chinese literature was excellent to write with deep understanding of 文理 without any limitation. The part of 虛字 or 虛詞說 belong to the column of 【副詞】 and 【接續詞】, 【轉詞】, 【止詞】 in 初等作文法 . It might be applicable to today’s Chinese literature education: To divide into ‘最(the most: 高等), 頗(quite: 次等) and 僅(little: 低等)’ and discuss about the difference. In addition, to explain of ‘然’ or ‘然而’ such as adversative transitions, in the sentence ‘轉詞文句의 轉字가 有이 一種 機器가 輪軸을 全憑旋轉야 活動을 得과 如니(轉詞 might be similar for a machine to get the action from the turning)’, it is visible for two sentences have two different aversive meaning through the sensible expression. In addition, there was various contents about 虛詞, this characteristic of the 虛詞說 in 初等作文法 might have the significant meaning from the modern times to nowadays after 100 years. Nowadays, the education about 虛詞 in the Classical Chinese literature in the middle and high school is not a simple issue, therefore, the study of it has been continued. This 虛詞說 in 初等作文法 was written by 元泳義 who had studied under 省齋 柳重敎(1832~1893), might be valuable materials to help in today’s learning and education of 虛詞."

At his advanced age, he was appointed to and served as the head of Boseong County(보성군), Later he returned to his hometown and lived in harmony with nature. He was not obsessed with the messy world and liked to write poets and work in his library. The reason why he wanted to be called ‘A person who drinks all the time(長飮子)’ is that he strived to escape from the messy world and to live in nature. However, he went to Seoul to participate in the funeral of Gojong(高宗), the last emperor of Choseon Dynasty(朝鮮). After one month after he returned from the funeral he committed suicide because of deep depression and despair that he was not able to escape. To summarize Oh Jae-young's life by quoting his poems titled 『The Collection of Sojae's Works(小齋集)』, ‘Source(源泉)’, ‘Live in seclusion(歸隱)’, ‘Know one's fate(知命)’, ‘A person who drinks all the time(長飮子)’, ‘See and learn from the past(稽古)’. They are legacies of his trying to do his best at any moment with an appropriate considerations to situations. His poems pursued the meaning and the rhyme rather than the form and kept distance from the existing rules, In their own way, the poems are joyful to read which are reminiscent of something in a poem like a painting. His poems are reminiscent of Wang Wei(王維), a poet of the Tang Dynasty(唐代), and his epic poems that contain rural life in the poems are reminiscent of Tao Yuanming(陶淵明) of the East Jin(東晉) period. His poems are not bound by rules of versification(律格), and the individuality that does not use the language of past poets is regarded as creativity.",

He was well versed in traditional knowledge of the East and knowledgeable about Western culture as well, and was involved in a wide range of creative activities, including calligraphy, painting, and music as well as literary works such as prose and poetry. Kim Yoon-sik had a fierce sense of author, and his literature, literary theory, and art theory formed one organic structure. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that his art theory, as an intellectual of the enlightenment movement, demonstrates a change in the perception of art in response to changes in the era of the late Joseon Dynasty. This article focuses on bringing light on the characteristics of Kim Yoon-sik s art theory and its organic relationship with literature theory. Kim Yoon-sik s art theory can be divided into calligraphy, painting, and music. As for the characteristics of calligraphy, he mentioned that one should first have a proper mindset, followed by honing according to the custom, and encouraged one to complete his own style. In painting, he emphasized that one should learn the standard of law, find the exquisite principle beyond the law, and realize the mysterious and ethereal level of the mind and hands, which naturally move despite oneself. Finally, in music, he showed a distinctive aspect to harmonize with nature. When comparing Kim Yoon-sik s literary and artistic theories, there is a slight difference in expression, but it can be confirmed that they are essentially consistent. According to him, the steps in the creation of literature can be summarized as moral training(修身) → knowledge(博學) → exquisite principle beyond the law(法外) → divine spirit(神韻), and the process of entering into the perfection of art can be identified as mindset → immitation(模倣) → exquisite principle beyond the law(法外) → divine spirit(神韻). He concluded that both literature and art could be completed only if one entered the level of God(神) . Kim Yoon-sik was a person who had a deep understanding of the nature of art and completed a high-dimensional art theory. The biggest feature of his art theory is that it is closely linked internally to his literary theory. As a result, it is believed that his literary world and art criticism could be upgraded to the next level. The understanding of Kim Yoon-sik s art theory is meaningful in terms of making his literary world more sincere and profound."
상급지휘관의 안전리더십이 예하 부대 안전행동에 미치는 영향에 관한 연구 : 보병사단을 대상으로,2021,"['변혁적 안전리더십', '거래적 안전리더십', '안전순응행동', '안전참여행동', '안전풍토', 'transformative safety leadership', 'transactional safety leadership', 'safety compliance behavior', 'safety reference behavior', 'safety climate']","중장비와 화기를 다루는 군에서의 안전사고는 사회에서의 안전사고에 비해 더 큰 위험성을 가지고 있다. 군에서도 안전사고 발생을 최소화하기 위해 지속적인 안전교육과 위험성평가 등이 이루어지고 있지만, 안전사고는 줄지 않고 꾸준히 발생하고 있는 것이 현실이다. 국내 외 연구 중 지도자의 안전 리더십이 안전행동에 유의미한 영향을 미친다는 것에 기반 하여 육군이 갖고 있는 특수성 속에서도 지휘관의 변혁적 안전리더십이 안전행동에 동일하게 유의미한 영향을 미치는지 알아보도록 한다. 본 연구를 통해 알게 된 사실은 다음과 같다. 첫째, 군 사단의 변혁적 안전리더십이 안전행동에 정적인 영향을 미치고 그 과정에서 안전풍토가 부분매개변수의 역할을 한다는 것을 발견하였다. 안전리더십과 안전행동에 상관관계에 대해 연구한 선행연구들은 안전리더십과 안전행동 간에 안전 분위기, 안전 동기 등의 매개효과를 밝히고 안전 동기가 안전행동으로 이어진다는 심리학적 개념을 사용했다. 하지만 안전풍토가 변혁적 안전리더십과 안전행동의 부분매개변수라는 점을 밝힌 선행연구가 없다는 점에서 의의가 있다. 둘째, 군의 안전풍토의 서로 다른 하위요인이 각각 안전행동에 다른 영향을 미치는 것이 아니라 상호유기적인 관계로 안전풍토의 서로 다른 하위요인들이 하나의 안전풍토라는 통합적 개념으로 안전행동에 영향을 미친다는 것을 알아냈다. 연구를 시작하기 전 ‘안전풍토의 서로 다른 하위요인이 각각 안전행동에 미치는 영향이 다를 것’이라는 예상과는 다른 결과였다. 요인분석을 실시하는 과정 속에서 군 사단의 변혁적 안전리더십이 안전행동에 미치는 영향에서 안전풍토의 하위요인이 각각 다른 영향을 미치는 것이 아니라 전체 하위요인이 하나의 요인으로 간주되어 적용하는 것이 타당하다는 것이다. 셋째, 군 안전풍토가 안전참여행동과 안전순응행동에 미치는 영향의 차이가 유의미하지 않다는 것이다. 안전풍토가 안전참여행동 및 안전순응행동에 정적인 영향을 미친다는 것은 선행연구들과 동일하게 판명되었다. 하지만 변혁적 안전리더십의 영향을 받은 안전 분위기, 안전 동기가 안전참여행동과 안전순응행동에 미치는 영향의 정도가 다르다는 선행연구와는 달리 변혁적 안전리더십이 안전풍토를 부분매개변수로 하여 안전참여행동과 안전순응행동에 미치는 영향의 정도가 유의미하게 차이나지 않는다는 것이다. 이와 같은 연구결과가 나온 이유는 군의 상명하복 문화와 크게 연관되어 있을 것이라고 판단하였다. 군은 지휘관의 명령 및 지시사항을 반드시 수명해야 한다는 상명하복 문화가 뿌리 깊게 있기 때문에 지휘관의 안전리더십으로 인한 규정과 지침을 즉각 수용하는 과정에서 안전리더십이 안전참여행동과 안전순응행동에 미치는 영향이 유의미한 차이를 보이게 된다. 하지만 안전풍토는 즉각적인 수용이 필요하지 않기 때문에 안전풍토로 인해 안전참여행동과 안전순응행동에 미치는 영향의 정도가 유의미하게 차이나지 않는 것으로 판단하였다. 본 연구는 몇 가지 한계점을 내포하고 있다. 첫째, 본 연구는 군 전체를 대상으로 한 것이 아닌 육군의 특정 지역에 있는 부대를 대상으로 설문조사를 했기 때문에 본 연구의 결과를 군 전체로 일반화하기에는 무리가 있다. 차후 타 지역에 있는 부대 혹은 타군까지 연구 범위를 넓혀 같은 결과가 나온다면 더욱 폭넓게 연구결과를 일반화할 수 있을 것이다. 둘째, 설문지에 측정 내용은 군 장병을 대상으로 했기 때문에 일부 수정되었다. 따라서 본 연구 결과를 민간인까지 일반화하기에는 무리가 있다. 민간인을 대상으로 하는 설문은 기존 Mohamed의 설문을 바탕으로 재구성 하는 것이 바람직하다. 셋째, 설문을 실시한 시기가 전례 없는 코로나 바이러스가 전 세계를 강타한 시기이기 때문에 포스트 코로나 시대의 설문 결과와는 다른 결과 값이 나왔을 가능성이 있다. 코로나가 종식된 이후에 동일한 설문을 같은 집단에 다시 실시해 비교 분석하는 것도 의미 있는 연구가 될 것이다.","Safety accidents in the military, which deal with heavy equipment and firearms, pose a greater risk than safety accidents in society. In order to minimize the occurrence of safety accidents in the county, continuous safety education and risk assessment are being conducted, but the reality is that safety accidents are occurring steadily without decreasing. Based on the fact that leaders safety leadership has a significant impact on safety behavior during domestic and foreign studies, it is necessary to find out whether transformative safety leadership of commanders has the same significant impact on safety behavior. The following is what I learned from this study. First, we found that transformative safety leadership of the military division has a static effect on safety behavior and that safety climate plays a role as a partial parameter in the process. Prior studies that studied the correlation between safety leadership and safety behavior revealed the mediating effects of safety atmosphere and safety motivation between safety leadership and safety behavior, and used psychological concepts that safety motivation leads to safety behavior. However, it is meaningful in that there is no prior study that reveals that the safety climate is a partial parameter of transformative safety leadership and safety behavior. Second, we find that different sub-factors of the military s safety climate do not have different effects on safety behavior, but because they are mutually organic, different sub-factors of the safety climate affect safety behavior under the integrated concept of a single safety climate. Before starting the study, it was a different result from the expectation that different sub-factors of the safety climate will have different effects on safety behavior. In the course of factor analysis, the military s transformational safety leadership has found that it is reasonable to apply the entire sub-factor as a factor, rather than each having a different effect on safety behavior. Third, it was found that the difference in the impact of the military safety climate on safety cham travel and safety conformity behavior was not significant. It has proved the same as previous studies that safety climate has a static effect on safety cham travel and safety conformity behaviour. However, unlike previous studies that show that safety atmosphere influenced by transformative safety leadership and safety motivation have different effects on safety travel and safety conformity behavior, transformative safety leadership does not significantly vary. The reason for this study was determined to be largely related to the culture of the county s top-down and bottom-down. Since the military has a deep underlying culture that commands and instructions from commanders must live, the impact of safety leadership on safety travel and safety conformity behavior will be significant in the process of immediately accepting regulations and guidelines. However, because safety climate does not require immediate acceptance, it was determined that the degree of impact on safety cham travel and safety conformity behavior was not significantly different. This study contains several limitations. First, the results of this study are unreasonable to generalize to the military as a whole, as this study surveyed units in a specific area of the Army, not the entire military. If the same results are obtained by expanding the scope of the research to units or other groups in other regions in the future, the research results can be generalized more widely. Second, the measurements in the questionnaire were partially modified because they targeted military personnel. Therefore, it is difficult to generalize the findings to civilians. It is desirable to reconstruct surveys targeting civilians based on existing Mohammed surveys. Therefore, it is…"
잎사귀 질병 검출을 위한 관심 영역 특징 추출 기반의 어텐션 강화 YOLO 모델,2021,"['attention YOLO model', 'object detection', 'image segmentation', 'deep convolutional neural networks', 'smart farm']",,"The YOLO model, which is widely used in the existing object detection, excludes the attention function that can learn which feature vectors are more important. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an attention YOLO model that can improve the object detection performance of the existing YOLO model. The proposed attention model was conceived from the fact that there is no information on diseases in the background area of the input leaf image, and spots and color information that can determine the presence or absence of the diseases exist only inside the leaf. By combining the YOLOs feature extraction subnetwork with the image segmentation subnetwork capable of dividing the background, leaf, and disease areas from the input leaf, it is intended to improve the ability to distinguish features in the region of interest. In other words, a new attention model that can spatially reinforce the importance of disease-related features in the YOLO model is introduced. In addition, through the experimental results, it is shown that the proposed attention YOLO model can improve the detection performance by about 0.06 in the mean Averaged Precision（mAP) evaluation compared to the existing YOLO model."
