CNN Auto-Encoder Network Using Dilated Inception for Image Steganography,2021,"['Information security', 'Image steganography', 'Dilated convolution', 'CNN', 'Auto-encoder']",,"Numerous studies have used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the field of information concealment as well as steganalysis, achieving promising results in terms of capacity and invisibility. In this study, we propose a CNN-based steganographic model to hide a color image within another color image. The proposed model consists of two sub-networks: the hiding network is used by the sender to conceal the secret image; and the reveal network is used by the recipient to extract the secret image from the stego image. The architecture of the concealment sub-network is inspired by the U-Net auto-encoder and benefits from the advantages of the dilated convolution. The reveal sub-network is inspired by the auto-encoder architecture. To ensure the integrity of the hidden secret image, the model is trained end to end: rather than training separately, the two sub-networks are trained simultaneously a pair of networks. The loss function is elaborated in such a way that it favors the quality of the stego image over the secret image as the stego image is the one that comes under steganalysis attacks. To validate the proposed model, we carried out several tests on a range of challenging publicly available image datasets such as ImageNet, Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW), and PASCAL-VOC12. Our results show that the proposed method can dissimulate an image into another one with the same size, reaching an embedding capacity of 24 bit per pixel without generating visual or structural artefacts on the host image. In addition, the proposed model is generic, that is, it does not depend on the image’s size or the database source."
"Enhanced and applicable algorithm for Big-Data by Combining Sparse Auto-Encoder and Load-Balancing, ProGReGA-KF",2021,"['Big-Data representation', 'Machine-Learning', 'massively multiplayer online architecture', 'Load-Balancing', 'Sparse Auto-Encoder']",,"Pervasive enhancement and required enforcement of the Internet of Things (IoTs) in a distributed massively multiplayer online architecture have effected in massive growth of Big-Data in terms of server over-load. There have been some previous works to overcome the overloading of server works. However, there are lack of considered methods, which is commonly applicable. Therefore, we propose a combing Sparse Auto-Encoder and Load-Balancing, which is ProGReGA for Big-Data of server loads. In the process of Sparse Auto-Encoder, when it comes to selection of the feature-pattern, the less relevant feature-pattern could be eliminated from Big-Data. In relation to Load-Balancing, the alleviated degradation of ProGReGA can take advantage of the less redundant feature-pattern. That means the most relevant of Big-Data representation can work. In the performance evaluation, we can find that the proposed method have become more approachable and stable."
Auto-encoder 기반의 촬영 각도 무관 동작 임베딩 생성 모델을 활용한 영상 속 동작 유사도 측정,2021,"['motion similarity', 'human analysis', 'auto-encoder', 'metric learning', 'deep learning', 'computer vision']",,"Analyzing a persons motion to measure similarity is used in the various problem. However, since the motion is captured through a camera, the motion expressed as a time series of two-dimensional joint coordinates in a video also changes if the camera angle is varied. If this factor is not taken into account when measuring motion similarity, the machine will not be able to determine motions with different camera angles as the same motion. In this study, in order to improve the similarity measurement performance in this situation, an auto-encoder based model that generates motion embedding independent of the camera angle factor was utilized. Furthermore, through the proposed algorithm that can measure the similarity from the generated motion embedding, it is possible to measure the motion similarity regardless of the camera angle. The experiment was conducted with two-dimensional joint coordinates of motions projecting from various angles and showed more accurate results than the similarity measured by motion embedding generated from a model that did not consider the camera angle."
Stacked Auto-Encoder Network to Predict Tensile Deformation Behavior of a Typical Nickel-Based Superalloy Considering Portevin–Le Chatelier Effects,2021,['Alloy · Deformation behavior · Portevin–Le Chatelier effect · Stacked auto-encoders network'],,"The intermediate-temperature (473–973 K) deformation behavior of a nickel-based superalloy is researched by uniaxialtensile experiments. It is observed that the flow characteristics and the Portevin–Le Chatelier (PLC) effects are significantlyaffected by the thermo-mechanical parameters. The serrated flow features are obvious under the testing conditions. A stackedauto-encoders (SAEs) network model is proposed for predicting the flow behaviors of the researched superalloy. The architectureof the established SAEs model is optimized layer by layer. The best number of hidden layer is 3, and the nodes perhidden layer are 15, 20 and 50, respectively. The excellent prediction ability suggests that the developed SAEs model canwell reconstruct the intermediate-temperature flow behavior involving the PLC effects of the researched superalloy."

The reason is that signature-based detection methods lack generalization capabilities for new attacks such as APT attacks. To solve these problems, research on machine learning-based intrusion detection systems is being actively conducted. However, in the actual network environment, attack samples are collected very little compared to normal samples, resulting in class imbalance problems. When a supervised learning-based anomaly detection model is trained with such data, the result is biased to the normal sample. In this paper, we propose to overcome this imbalance problem through One-Class Anomaly Detection using an auto encoder. The experiment was conducted through the NSL-KDD data set and compares the performance with the supervised learning models for the performance evaluation of the proposed method."

In this paper, an advanced application of CNN, the CAE function of CNN is employed to detect faults. This method uses the characteristics of reconstruction of CAE. Difference of input images of the CNN and reconstructed images extracted by CAE were used as the guideline of fault detection. In the fault condition of the system, the difference was larger than the predetermined threshold of error. The encoder of CAE can be fine-tuned to classify the fault types of CDPTS. Finally, this method was well applied to diagnose the fault types of the test CDPTS installed in the laboratory."
천해 음향 통신에서 이미지 향상을 위한 디노이징 오토인코더의 성능 평가,2021,"['Underwater acoustic communication', 'Shallow water', 'Multipath channel', 'Denoising autoencoder']",,"Underwater acoustic communication channel is influenced by environmental parameters such as multipath, background noise and scattering. Therefore, a transmitted signal is influenced by the sea surface and the sea bottom boundaries, and a received signal shows a delay spread. These factors create a noise in the image and degrade the quality of underwater acoustic communication. To solve these problems, in this paper, we evaluate the performance of an underwater acoustic communication model using a denoising auto-encoder used for unsupervised learning. Noise images generated by the underwater multipath channel were collected and used as training data. Experimental results were analyzed as a PSNR parameter that expressed the noise ratio of the two images."

In specific situations, however, the vehicle needs to be controlled by human and the driving mode must be switched from autonomous to manual. At the moment, it is difficult to have driving stability immediately because drivers were doing other tasks in the autonomous mode. For safety issue, driving stability after the take-over should be recovered quickly, and it is necessary to monitor driving stability in real time. In this study, we propose an algorithm for judging driving stability quantitatively using the data of drivers, vehicles, and the environment. We suggest one class classification approach based on convolutional auto encoder. And also, the numerical experiments are conducted to compare the results between the proposed algorithm and a rule-based algorithm, so we verify the effectiveness and rationality of the algorithm."

시계열 예측을 위한 스타일 기반 트랜스포머,2021,"['Time Series Forecasting', 'Transformer', 'Generative Decoder', 'Style Transfer', '시계열 예측', '트랜스포머', '생성 디코더', '스타일 변환']",,"Time series forecasting refers to predicting future time information based on past time information. Accurately predicting future information is crucial because it is used for establishing strategies or making policy decisions in various fields. Recently, a transformer model has been mainly studied for a time series prediction model. However, the existing transformer model has a limitation in that it has an auto-regressive structure in which the output result is input again when the prediction sequence is output. This limitation causes a problem in that accuracy is lowered when predicting a distant time point. This paper proposes a sequential decoding model focusing on the style transformation technique to handle these problems and make more precise time series forecasting. The proposed model has a structure in which the contents of past data are extracted from the transformer-encoder and reflected in the style-based decoder to generate the predictive sequence. Unlike the decoder structure of the conventional auto-regressive transformer, this structure has the advantage of being able to more accurately predict information from a distant view because the prediction sequence is output all at once. As a result of conducting a prediction experiment with various time series datasets with different data characteristics, it was shown that the model presented in this paper has better prediction accuracy than other existing time series prediction models."

A total of 13 activities based on the laboratory experiments' data are used for the initial performance comparison. We have improved classification performance using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with an auto-encoder feature reduction and parameter tuning. With various publically available HAR datasets, we could also achieve significant improvement in HAR classification. Our CNN model is also compared against Recurrent-Neural-Network(RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) to demonstrate its superiority. Noticeably, our model could distinguish both general activities and near-identical activities such as sitting down on the chair and floor, with almost perfect classification accuracy."

The Korean Triage Acuity Scale (KTAS) is mandatorily applied at EDs in South Korea.For rapid triage, we studied machine learning-based triage systems composed of a speech recognition model and natural language processing-based classification.Methods: We simulated 762 triage cases that consisted of 18 classes with six types of the main symptom (chest pain, dyspnea, fever, stroke, abdominal pain, and headache) and three levels of KTAS. In addition, we recorded conversations between emergency patients and clinicians during the simulation. We used speech recognition models to transcribe the conversation.Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) were used for KTAS and symptom classification. Additionally, we evaluated the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values of features to interpret the classifiers.Results: The character error rate of the speech recognition model was reduced to 25.21% through transfer learning. With auto-transcribed scripts, support vector machine (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81–0.9), KNN (AUROC, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.85–0.93), RF (AUROC, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.82–0.9) and BERT (AUROC, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.75–0.87) achieved excellent classification performance.Based on SHAP, we found “stress”, “pain score point”, “fever”, “breath”, “head” and “chest” were the important vocabularies for determining KTAS and symptoms.Conclusion: We demonstrated the potential of an automatic KTAS classification system using speech recognition models, machine learning and BERT-based classifiers."
