Active researches are going on; visual-based models using CNNs. U-net is one of the visual-based models. It has shown strong performance for semantic segmentation. Although various U-net studies have been conducted, studies on tracking objects with unclear outlines such as gases and smokes are still insufficient. We conducted a U-net study to tackle this limitation. In this paper, we describe how 3D cameras are used to collect data. The data are organized into learning and test sets.

딥러닝 기반의 Semantic Segmentation을 위한 Residual U-Net에 관한 연구,2021,['-'],"본 논문에서는 U-Net 기반의 semantic segmentation 방법에서 정확도를 향상시키기 위해 residual learning을 활용한 인코더-디코더 구조의 모델을 제안하였다. U-Net은 딥러닝 기반의 semantic segmentation 방법이며 자율주행 자동차, 의료 영상 분석과 같은 응용 분야에서 주로 사용된다. 기존 U-Net은 인코더의 얕은 구조로 인해 특징 압축 과정에서 손실이 발생한다. 특징 손실은 객체의 클래스 분류에 필요한 context 정보 부족을 초래하고 segmentation 정확도를 감소시키는 문제가 있다. 이를 개선하기 위해 제안하는 방법은 기존 U-Net에 특징 손실과 기울기 소실 문제를 방지하는데 효과적인 residual learning을 활용한 인코더를 통해 context 정보를 효율적으로 추출하였다. 또한, 인코더에서 down-sampling 연산을 줄여 특징맵에 포함된 공간 정보의 손실을 개선하였다. 제안하는 방법은 Cityscapes 데이터셋 실험에서 기존 U-Net 방법에 비해 segmentation 결과가 약 12% 향상되었다.","In this paper, we proposed an encoder-decoder model utilizing residual learning to improve the accuracy of the U-Net-based semantic segmentation method. U-Net is a deep learning-based semantic segmentation method and is mainly used in applications such as autonomous vehicles and medical image analysis. The conventional U-Net occurs loss in feature compression process due to the shallow structure of the encoder. The loss of features causes a lack of context information necessary for classifying objects and has a problem of reducing segmentation accuracy. To improve this, The proposed method efficiently extracted context information through an encoder using residual learning, which is effective in preventing feature loss and gradient vanishing problems in the conventional U-Net. Furthermore, we reduced down-sampling operations in the encoder to reduce the loss of spatial information included in the feature maps. The proposed method showed an improved segmentation result of about 12% compared to the conventional U-Net in the Cityscapes dataset experiment."
U-Net 기반의 적대적 생성망,2021,"['Generative adversarial network', 'U-Net-based generator', 'Image generation']","적대적 생성망 (Generative adversarial network, GAN)을 통해 잡음 신호로부터 고해상도의 영상을 만드는 기술들이 활발하게 연구되고 있다. 기존 기법들의 생성자 (Generator)는 입력 잡음 신호를 여러 개의 레지듀얼 블록 (Residual block)을 통과시켜 영상을 만들고, 판별자 (Discriminator)는 만들어진 영상을 실제 영상과 분류하도록 학습된다. 일반적으로 GAN은 네트워크 구조를 바꾸기보다는 정규화 (Normalization) 또는 학습 기술을 개발하여 네트워크의 성능을 향상시켰다. 기존의 접근 방법과는 달리, 본 논문에서는 U-Net 기반의 생성자 네트워크 구조를 제안한다. 제안하는 기법은 적은 수의 네트워크 파라미터 증가에도 불구하고 기존 구조보다 우수한 영상 생성 성능을 낸다. 실험 결과는 Cifar-10, CelebA, LSUN 데이터셋을 통해 학습된 생성자가 기존 기법에서 제안된 학습자보다 고품질의 영상을 생성함을 보인다.","Recently, generative adversarial network (GAN), which generates high-resolution images from an input random-noise vector, has been extensively studied. The traditional generator consisting of multiple residual blocks is trained to generate high-quality image, whereas discriminator is trained to distinguish between real and generated samples. To improve the performance of GAN, conventional methods suggest novel regularization techniques or training strategies rather than modifying the generator architecture. Different with the conventional approaches, we propose a novel generator architecture inspired by U-Net. The proposed method significantly improves the generative performance with marginal training overhead. Extensive experiments with various datasets including CIFAR-10, CelebA, and LSUN show that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of GAN in terms of Frechet inception distance (FID)."

딥러닝 기반 거리 영상의 Semantic Segmentation을 위한 Atrous Residual U-Net,2021,['-'],,"In this paper, we proposed an Atrous Residual U-Net (AR-UNet) to improve the segmentation accuracy of semantic segmentation method based on U-Net. The U-Net is mainly used in fields such as medical image analysis, autonomous vehicles, and remote sensing images. The conventional U-Net lacks extracted features due to the small number of convolution layers in the encoder part. The extracted features are essential for classifying object categories, and if they are insufficient, it causes a problem of lowering the segmentation accuracy. Therefore, to improve this problem, we proposed the AR-UNet using residual learning and ASPP in the encoder. Residual learning improves feature extraction ability and is effective in preventing feature loss and vanishing gradient problems caused by continuous convolutions. In addition, ASPP enables additional feature extraction without reducing the resolution of the feature map. Experiments verified the effectiveness of the AR-UNet with Cityscapes dataset. The experimental results showed that the AR-UNet showed improved segmentation results compared to the conventional U-Net. In this way, AR-UNet can contribute to the advancement of many applications where accuracy is important."
Fast and Accurate Single Image Super-Resolution via Enhanced U-Net,2021,"['Single Image Super-resolution', 'Convolutional Neural Networks', 'Information Propagation', 'U-Net Block']",,"Recent studies have demonstrated the strong ability of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to significantly boost the performance in single image super-resolution (SISR). The key concern is how to efficiently recover and utilize diverse information frequencies across multiple network layers, which is crucial to satisfying super-resolution image reconstructions. Hence, previous work made great efforts to potently incorporate hierarchical frequencies through various sophisticated architectures. Nevertheless, economical SISR also requires a capable structure design to balance between restoration accuracy and computational complexity, which is still a challenge for existing techniques. In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing a competent architecture called Enhanced U-Net Network (EUN), which can yield ready-to-use features in miscellaneous frequencies and combine them comprehensively. In particular, the proposed building block for EUN is enhanced from U-Net, which can extract abundant information via multiple skip concatenations. The network configuration allows the pipeline to propagate information from lower layers to higher ones. Meanwhile, the block itself is committed to growing quite deep in layers, which empowers different types of information to spring from a single block. Furthermore, due to its strong advantage in distilling effective information, promising results are guaranteed with comparatively fewer filters. Comprehensive experiments manifest our model can achieve favorable performance over that of state-of-the-art methods, especially in terms of computational efficiency."

The land cover map is mapped using remote sensing data, and the classification results may vary depending on the acquisition time of the data used even for the same area. In this study, to overcome the classification accuracy limit of single-period data, multi-series satellite images were used to learn the difference in the spectral reflectance characteristics of the land surface according to seasons on a U-Net model, one of the deep learning algorithms, to improve classification accuracy. In addition, the degree of improvement in classification accuracy is compared by comparing the accuracy of single-period data. Seoul, which consists of various land covers including 30% of green space and the Han River within the area, was set as the research target and quarterly Sentinel-2 satellite images for 2020 were aquired. The U-Net model was trained using the sub-class land cover map mapped by the Korean Ministry of Environment.

Vision measurement of gear pitting based on DCGAN and U-Net,2021,['· Gear pitting · Sample augmentation · Computer vision · Fatigue test · Image segmentation'],,"To quantitatively detect the gear pitting, this paper proposes a vision measurement method based on deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) and fully convolutional segmentation network (U-Net) for measuring the area ratio of gear pitting. A machine vision system is designed to automatically collect the pitting images of all gear teeth obtained from gear fatigue tests, but the pitting images are not sufficient due to the high cost of gear fatigue test. To solve the problem of small sample, DCGAN is applied to expand pitting samples. By the expansive sample set, the edge detection algorithm and U-Net are respectively used to segment the tooth surface and pitting. The proposed approach is applied to measure the gear pitting, and a comprehensive evaluation index is designed to evaluate the performance of gear pitting detection. Experimental results show that the average relative error and the absolute error of pitting area ratio obtained by the proposed method are respectively 7.83 % and 0.18 %, which are much lower than those obtained by the conventional detection method without sample augmentation.

To overcome these limitations, studies using neural networks to classify oil spills are recently investigated. However, the studies to evaluate whether the performance of model shows a consistent detection performance for various oil spill cases were insufficient. Therefore, in this study, two CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) with basic structures (Simple CNN and U-net) were used to discover whether there is a difference in detection performance according to the structure of CNN and distribution characteristics of oil spill. As a result, through the method proposed in this study, the Simple CNN with contracting path only detected oil spill with an F1 score of 86.24% and U-net, which has both contracting and expansive path showed an F1 score of 91.44%. Both models successfully detected oil spills, but detection performance of the U-net was higher than Simple CNN. Additionally, in order to compare the accuracy of models according to various oil spill cases, the cases were classified into four different categories according to the spatial distribution characteristics of the oil spill (presence of land near the oil spill area) and the clarity of border between oil and seawater. The Simple CNN had F1 score values of 85.71%, 87.43%, 86.50%, and 85.86% for each category, showing the maximum difference of 1.71%. In the case of U-net, the values for each category were 89.77%, 92.27%, 92.59%, and 92.66%, with the maximum difference of 2.90%. Such results indicate that neither model showed significant differences in detection performance by the characteristics of oil spill distribution. However, the difference in detection tendency was caused by the difference in the model structure and the oil spill distribution characteristics.

For this, ConvLSTM2D U-Net structure model considering temporal consistency of data was applied, and we evaluated accuracy of the ConvLSTM2D U-Net model using a RainNet model and an extrapolation-based advection model. In addition, we tried to improve the uncertainty in the model training process by performing learning not only with a single model but also with 10 ensemble models. The trained neural network rainfall prediction model was optimized to generate 10-minute advance prediction data using four consecutive data of the past 30 minutes from the present. The results of deep learning rainfall prediction models are difficult to identify schematically distinct differences, but with ConvLSTM2D U-Net, the magnitude of the prediction error is the smallest and the location of rainfall is relatively accurate. In particular, the ensemble ConvLSTM2D U-Net showed high CSI, low MAE, and a narrow error range, and predicted rainfall more accurately and stable prediction performance than other models. However, the prediction performance for a specific point was very low compared to the prediction performance for the entire area, and the deep learning rainfall prediction model also had limitations. Through this study, it was confirmed that the ConvLSTM2D U-Net neural network structure to account for the change of time could increase the prediction accuracy, but there is still a limitation of the convolution deep neural network model due to spatial smoothing in the strong rainfall region or detailed rainfall prediction."

Parenchymal diseases included interstitial lung disease (ILD), emphysema, nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease, tuberculous destroyed lung, pneumonia, lung cancer, and other diseases. Five experienced radiologists manually drew the margin of the lungs, slice by slice, on CT images. The dataset used to develop the network consisted of 157 cases for training, 20 cases for development, and 26 cases for internal validation. Two-dimensional (2D) U-Net and three-dimensional (3D) U-Net models were used for the task. The network was trained to segment the lung parenchyma as a whole and segment the right and left lung separately. The University Hospitals of Geneva ILD dataset, which contained high-resolution CT images of ILD, was used for external validation.Results: The Dice similarity coefficients for internal validation were 99.6 ± 0.3% (2D U-Net whole lung model), 99.5 ± 0.3% (2D U-Net separate lung model), 99.4 ± 0.5% (3D U-Net whole lung model), and 99.4 ± 0.5% (3D U-Net separate lung model). The Dice similarity coefficients for the external validation dataset were 98.4 ± 1.0% (2D U-Net whole lung model) and 98.4 ± 1.0% (2D U-Net separate lung model). In 31 cases, where the extent of ILD was larger than 75% of the lung parenchymal area, the Dice similarity coefficients were 97.9 ± 1.3% (2D U-Net whole lung model) and 98.0 ± 1.2% (2D U-Net separate lung model).Conclusion: The deep neural network achieved excellent performance in automatically delineating the boundaries of lung parenchyma with extensive pathological conditions on non-contrast chest CT images."
Reproduction strategy of radiation data with compensation of data loss using a deep learning technique,2021,"['Deep learning', 'U-net algorithm', 'Radiation map', 'Sensor network system', 'Reproduction']",,"In nuclear-related facilities, such as nuclear power plants, research reactors, accelerators, and nuclear waste storage sites, radiation detection, and mapping are required to prevent radiation overexposure. Sensor network systems consisting of radiation sensor interfaces and wxireless communication units have become promising tools that can be used for data collection of radiation detection that can in turn be used to draw a radiation map. During data collection, malfunctions in some of the sensors can occasionally occur due to radiation effects, physical damage, network defects, sensor loss, or other reasons. This paper proposes a reproduction strategy for radiation maps using a U-net model to compensate for the loss of radiation detection data. To perform machine learning and verification, 1,561 simulations and 417 measured data of a sensor network were performed. The reproduction results show an accuracy of over 90%. The proposed strategy can offer an effective method that can be used to resolve the data loss problem for conventional sensor network systems and will specifically contribute to making initial responses with preserved data and without the high cost of radiation leak accidents at nuclear facilities."

However, specific urban green information such as street trees was identified just as grassland or even not classified them as a vegetated area in the map. Therefore, this study classified detailed urban green information(i.e., tree, shrub, and grass), not included in the existing level 3 land cover map, using two types of high-resolution(<1m) remote sensing data(i.e., airborne LiDAR and RGB ortho imagery) in Suwon, South Korea. U-Net, one of image segmentation deep learning approaches, was adopted to classify detailed urban green space. A total of three classification models(i.e., LRGB10, LRGB5, and RGB5) were proposed depending on the target number of classes and the types of input data. The average overall accuracies for test sites were 83.40% (LRGB10), 89.44%(LRGB5), and 74.76%(RGB5). Among three models, LRGB5, which uses both airborne LiDAR and RGB ortho imagery with 5 target classes(i.e., tree, shrub, grass, building, and the others), resulted in the best performance. The area ratio of total urban green space(based on trees, shrub, and grass information) for the entire Suwon was 45.61%(LRGB10), 43.47%(LRGB5), and 44.22%(RGB5). All models were able to provide additional 13.40% of urban tree information on average when compared to the existing level 3 land cover map.

However, many deep learning-based studies are still focused on classifying the types of cracks. The classification of crack types is highly anticipated in that it can improve the crack detection process, which is currently relying on manual intervention. However, it is essential to calculate the severity of the cracks as well as identifying the type of cracks in actual pavement maintenance planning, but studies related to road crack detection have not progressed enough to automated calculation of the severity of cracks. In order to calculate the severity of the crack, the type of crack and the area of the crack in the image must be identified together. This study deals with a method of using Mobilenet-SSD that is deep learning-based object detection techniques to effectively automate the simultaneous detection of crack types and crack areas. To improve the accuracy of object-detection for road cracks, several experiments were conducted to combine the U-Net for automatic segmentation of input image and object-detection model, and the results were summarized. As a result, image masking with U-Net is able to maximize object-detection performance with 0.9315 mAP value.

The Relationship Between Debt Securities Issuance and Operational Performance,2021,"['Bank Performance', 'Bond', 'Debt Issuance', 'Efficiency Profit', 'Net Interest Margin']",,"This study aims to find out what determinants have the most influence in improving bank operational performance, including profit efficiency policies or debt securities issuance. Profit efficiency policy is proxied by net interest margin, which describes the input and output of the bank’s production activities as an intermediary institution. Profit efficiency contributes more influence than issuing debt securities. The issuance of bonds is a proxy for bank policy in issuing debt securities. Researchers investigated some views stating that issuing debt is risky since it will negatively affect bank operational performance. This research differs from previous studies in that it used a non-linear test to find the optimal value indicating that additional debt securities issuance can improve bank operational performance. Based on ownership, the samples were separated into two categories, government-owned banks and private banks. The policy of issuing debt securities to private banks shows an inverted U-shape, whereas government-owned banks are U-shaped. This research uses a perceptual map to visualize the implementation of profit efficiency policies and of debt securities issuance in sample banks.

The Communist Party of China accepted the market system after the reform and opening, accepting Chinese anti-government artists who opposed China’s policy line, and being able to accommodate a wide range of works into the art market.

This study examines the normalization of diplomatic relations between Korea and Vietnam in 1992 in the political dynamics of recognition. Based on the ‘theory of recognition’, succeeded from Hegel to Honneth, the study reveals the normalization of Korea-Vietnam was developed within the framework of the triplet structure of recognition and was a process of reducing cognitive dissonance. In 1964, South Korea entered into the Vietnam War, establishing hostile relations with North Vietnam and friendly relations with South Vietnam. After the fall of Saigon(currently Ho Chi Minh City) in 1975, diplomatic relations between Korea and Vietnam were severed. In the late 1980s, the two countries gradually developed friendly relations and normalized diplomatic relations in 1992. In which process could the two hostile countries come to embrace each other? How were they able to normalize diplomatic ties in 1992, earlier than normalization of diplomatic relations between U.S. and Vietnam in 1995? This study focuses on the fact that the change in the relationship between Korea and Vietnam was made in the rapid process under the justification of pursuing national interests and there were major historical inflection points, converting mutual cognitive dissonance into cognitive harmony. The authors emphasize the normalization of Korea-Vietnam was a process of in which a complex internal logic acted in the triplet structure of recognition. From the constructivist viewpoint of recognition, this study argues that the economic cooperation oriented functional approach of normalization of Korea-Vietnam deferred the tasks which were not faced at the time, and left paradoxical legacy that recalls these tasks in present days."

The state-of-the-art models for document image binarization are variants of encoder-decoder architectures, such as FCN (fully convolutional network) and U-Net. Despite their success, they still suffer from three limitations: (1) reduced feature map resolution due to consecutive strided pooling or convolutions, (2) multiple scales of target objects, and (3) reduced localization accuracy due to the built-in invariance of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). To overcome these three challenges, we propose an improved semantic segmentation model, referred to as DP-LinkNet, which adopts the D-LinkNet architecture as its backbone, with the proposed hybrid dilated convolution (HDC) and spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) modules between the encoder and the decoder. Extensive experiments are conducted on recent document image binarization competition (DIBCO) and handwritten document image binarization competition (H-DIBCO) benchmark datasets.

In the early history of banks in the U.K. and U.S., the separation was adopted as a foundational principle. In Korea also, the separation has stood long since it was adopted in the Interim Measure Act for Financial Institutions of 1961 and Banking Act of 1982. Why the separation of banking and commerce? First, it concerns the bank soundness, systemic safety and depositor protection. Second, the regulatory scope in which the separation rule applies has been expanded from ‘banking in nature’ to ‘financial in nature’under the GLB Act in the U.S. Fourth, financial safety net such as deposit insurance includes securities firms, insurance, saving institution as well as banks.

Several India news media mentioned this accident cold be similar with M.C. Mehta case and could be applicable for the Rule of Absolute Liability. Because the Rule of Absolute Liability is a completely new concept to us, it is necessary to introduce both Rule of Strict Liability in U.K. and Rule of Absolute Liability in India that are not familiar to the civil law system.In order to satisfy The Rule of Strict Liability, it requires that the defendant must collect or keep an exceptionally dangerous this on his or her land. The defendant’s use of land must be non-natural and extraordinary compared with the circumstance of time and place around the defendant’s property. The dangerous thing must escape from defendant’s property. And, in the Rule of Strict Liability from Rylands v. Fletcher, it provides the possible defences as exceptions of application of this rule, such as Plaintiff’s own default or consent, Act of God, Act of third party, and Statutory authority.The rule of Strict Liability from Rylands v. Fletcher could not be a same meaning of the No-fault liability theory. It might be overlapped in some portion but not contain the equal value or concept in laws of Tort. In U.K and India, in order to provide the rule of No-fault Liability, it is required to enact several different types of laws, such as Workermen’s Compensation and Motor Vehicles Act.There were two tragic gas leakage accidents in India, called as Bhopal gas leaking accident in 1984 and M.C. Mehta v. Union of India (1987) in which the accident was occurred in Delhi in 1985. In these accidents, the poor who were in lower levels of Cast system had mainly suffered from them. In this regards, the India judiciary recognized the need of social safety-net and protection from the ‘hazardous and inherently dangerous activities.’the rule of Absolute Liability exceptionally provides the notion of ‘Mass Tort’ and cover the ‘public interest’ engaged in the activity for private profit."

If the field compost flows into the water system due to rainfall, nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen contained in the field compost can adversely affect the water quality of the river. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting field compost using unmanned aerial vehicle images and deep learning-based semantic segmentation. Based on 39 ortho images acquired in the study area, about 30,000 data were obtained through data augmentation. Then, the accuracy was evaluated by applying the semantic segmentation algorithm developed based on U-net and the filtering technique of Open CV. As a result of the accuracy evaluation, the pixel accuracy was 99.97%, the precision was 83.80%, the recall rate was 60.95%, and the F1-Score was 70.57%. The low recall compared to precision is due to the underestimation of compost pixels when there is a small proportion of compost pixels at the edges of the image. After, It seems that accuracy can be improved by combining additional data sets with additional bands other than the RGB band."

Respiratory-correlated 4D digital tomosynthesis with deep convolutional neural networks for image-guided radiation therapy,2021,['4D digital tomosynthesis · Convolutional neural network · Quantitative accuracy · Spatial resolution · Image noise'],,"4D digital tomosynthesis (DTS) techniques for image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) are able to reduce radiation dose, scan and reconstruction time compared to 4D cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). In spite of these benefits, the 4D DTS techniques cause the degradation of image quality due to an intrinsic imaging strategy and consequently reduce treatment accuracy. In this study, a deep learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN) framework was proposed for 4D DTS imaging. The proposed CNN framework consisted of the data restoration network based on a U-Net and the denoising network combined with a 2D wavelet transform, and the network training was implemented with clinical images. The quality of the 4D DTS images obtained from the proposed model was evaluated in terms of quantitative accuracy, spatial resolution and noise property. The results showed that the proposed CNN framework improved the quantitative accuracy of 4D DTS images by 3–19%, and the spatial resolution and noise for the proposed CNN framework were reduced by 2.24–7.33% and 8.92–40.07%, respectively, in comparison to other imaging models. These results represented that the degradation of the 4D DTS image quality can be recovered using the proposed CNN framework, and the proposed model is suitable for maintaining spatial resolution as well as suppressing noise and artifacts. In conclusion, the proposed CNN framework can be potentially used to improve the quality of 4D DTS images for the IGRT."

We further examined the Deep learning-based Holographic Ultrasound Generation algorithm (Deep-HUG). We implement the U-Net-based algorithm and examine its generalizability by training on a dataset, which consists of randomly distributed disks, and testing on the alphabets (A-Z). Furthermore, we compare the Deep-HUG with the previous algorithm in terms of computation time, accuracy, and uniformity. It was found that the accuracy and uniformity of the Deep-HUG are somewhat lower than those of the previous algorithm whereas the computation time is 190 times faster than that of the previous algorithm, demonstrating that Deep-HUG has potential as a useful technique to rapidly generate an ultrasound hologram for various applications."

To interpret real data with the model trained by synthetic data, the synthetic data used for training should be geologically realistic. In this study, we introduce a method to generate realistic synthetic seismic data. Initially, reflectivity models are generated to include realistic fault structures, and then, a one-way wave equation is applied to efficiently generate seismic stack sections. Next, a migration algorithm is used to remove diffraction artifacts and random noise is added to mimic actual field data. A convolutional neural network model based on the U-Net structure is used to verify the generated synthetic data set.

Synthetic CT generation from weakly paired MR images using cycle-consistent GAN for MR-guided radiotherapy,2021,['.'],,"Although MR-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) is advancing rapidly, generating accurate synthetic CT (sCT) from MRI is stillchallenging. Previous approaches using deep neural networks require large dataset of precisely co-registered CT and MRIpairs that are diffi cult to obtain due to respiration and peristalsis. Here, we propose a method to generate sCT based on deeplearning training with weakly paired CT and MR images acquired from an MRgRT system using a cycle-consistent GAN(CycleGAN) framework that allows the unpaired image-to-image translation in abdomen and thorax. Data from 90 cancerpatients who underwent MRgRT were retrospectively used. CT images of the patients were aligned to the correspondingMR images using deformable registration, and the deformed CT (dCT) and MRI pairs were used for network training andtesting. The 2.5D CycleGAN was constructed to generate sCT from the MRI input. To improve the sCT generation performance,a perceptual loss that explores the discrepancy between high-dimensional representations of images extracted froma well-trained classifi er was incorporated into the CycleGAN. The CycleGAN with perceptual loss outperformed the U-netin terms of errors and similarities between sCT and dCT, and dose estimation for treatment planning of thorax, and abdomen.The sCT generated using CycleGAN produced virtually identical dose distribution maps and dose-volume histogramscompared to dCT. CycleGAN with perceptual loss outperformed U-net in sCT generation when trained with weakly paireddCT-MRI for MRgRT. The proposed method will be useful to increase the treatment accuracy of MR-only or MR-guidedadaptive radiotherapy."

In total, 473 cows were examined. According to the parity, cows were divided into four groups: primiparous (P), and multiparous in the second (M2), in the third (M3), and in subsequent lactations (M4). The feeding of cows was based on total mixed ration (TMR) <i>ad libitum</i>. Milk and blood samples were collected individually from each cow three times per standard lactation period.Results: Greater exacerbation of changes in the dynamics of the blood plasma parameters examined was proved for multiparous cows. The highest value of β-hydroxybutyrate acid (0.946 mmol/L) was found for multiparous cows from group M3 at the beginning of lactation. However, it was still in the normal range. The results showed aspartate aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) activities in dairy cows during lactation had significant variations taking in to account stage of lactation. The highest activity of GGT was found in the group of the oldest cows and measured from 26.36 U/L at the beginning of lactation to 48.75 U/L at the end of the lactation period.Conclusion: The time-related changes in the concentrations of the biochemical parameters described differ markedly among lactating cows, though the housing conditions on the research dairy farm are highly standardised. This indicates that the ability to cope with metabolic stress is mainly affected by the individual predispositions of cows and feed nutrient supply in different stage of lactation. Especially, the feed nutrient supply (in net energy for lactation), which was the best in TMR 1 in comparison TMR 3."

The basic model was selected as a representative farmhouse case in the Jeonnam region, and seven scenarios for conventional crops were tested. The economic feasibility of crop switching was analyzed through partial budget analysis (PBA). The PBA analysis results were supplemented by adding a sensitivity analysis and a break-even point (BEP) analysis. As a result of the analyses, it was found that crop conversion was economical because the increase in the profit coefficient was greater than the increase in the loss coefficient due to the introduction of mango for all conventional crops. The economics of introducing mango was more sensitive to changes in gross income than to changes in cost items. The results show the detailed conditions of crop selection according to the conditions and preferences of individual farms by presenting the direction of increase and decrease by budget item and information on the amount of increase or decrease. In particular, the BEP analysis result, which is about half of the farms case, is significant in that it presents the minimum target value according to production and market risks."

The standard public health center’s total floor area is 279㎡ and it is one story building of public health center. For energy use situation and zero energy realization, an analysis was performed through TRANSYS simulation. All energy of the standard model is supplied by electricity. For the cooling and heating system, the air to water heat pump was applied. According to the analysis, the annual electricity consumption of the standard public health center was 21,075kWh and it was indicated in the following order: heating - 36%, appliance and plug - 32%, lighting - 14%, cooling - 11%, and hot water - 7%. The installation capacity of photovoltaic for net zero energy realization was 15.84kWp, and annually 21,192kWh of electricity was produced, which is more than 21,075kWh, the electricity consumption of the standard public health center branch. Consequently, it was found out that net zero energy is realized at the current insulation and technology level."

Pressure drop axial distribution uniformity of the particle bed in the radial bed,2021,"['Radial Bed', 'Pressure Drop Distribution', 'Particle Bed', 'Main Channel', 'Momentum Exchange Coefficient']",,"In a radial bed, the uniformity of the pressure drop distribution is investigated by Euler single-phase flow and porous media models under different operating mode (CF-U/Z, CP-U/Z), gas flow rate (120-240m3/h), particle diameter ((0.5-3)exp-3 m) and bed voidage (0.3-0.6). According to the nonuniform index η, the uniformity relates to these parameters and improves with increasing total pressure drop of particle bed Δps (sum of the pressure drops of particle bed and gas perforation) or decreasing main channel pressure drop Δpg. Comparing the flow fields with/without particles, Δps is approximately equal to the pressure drop of the particle bed with high-porosity Johnson net, which is well calculated by the Ergun equation. Δpg can be calculated by the modified momentum equation containing k.After changing the wall shear stress and gas-solid axial resistance, it is found that the internal generation factors for k include the influence of gas perforation on boundary layer and the existence of gas axial velocity after perforation.Besides, the global/local k hardly changes with the investigated parameters. The local k is a function of axial position or velocity ratio, which changes obviously at the end of the main channel for the existence of a gas stagnation zone."

The Effects of Corporate Governance Mechanisms on Firm Performance: Empirical Evidence from Vietnam,2021,"['Knowledge Capability', 'Upper Echelons', 'Gender Diversity', 'Firm Performance']",,"This paper investigated the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and firm performance in Vietnam. Based on a dataset of 101 HOSE-listed manufacturing firms, the results showed that CEOs’ knowledge capability, gender diversity, and board size are positively associated with firm performance, whereas firm age is negatively associated. These findings suggested that firms should consider enlarging the boardrooms, but to a certain extent to avoid an inverse-U-shaped decline of performance; furthermore, firms should promote women executives’ presence in a boardroom for it brings greater cultural-diversity benefits and inhibits information asymmetry. Contrary, the aging process impedes firms’ growth. It depreciates their values in terms of total assets, so managers must review their assets’ net value after each working year to avoid such a hardship. However, the thesis constrains itself since it did not treat the TMTs’ knowledge capability equally as the CEOs’ and completely excluded their treatment. Besides, it did not regard the effect of external governance mechanisms such as the supply-demand relationship, customer behavior, market imperfections, and market concentration due to data unavailability. Based on the main findings, several suggestions are set forth for firms and managers to enhance performance and minimize a poor governance mechanism’s adverse consequence."

The purpose of this research is to clarify the properties of subjective well-being, and enhance the understanding of subjective well-being to provide its theoretical basis. Research was conducted by using Walker and Avant’s conceptual analysis process. From January 2005 to June 2020, ‘subject well-being’ as used as the keyword to be searched on Korean and International literature in KERIS(www.riss4u.net) and PubMed. The results showed that the properties of subject well-being were positive mind, stress management, satisfaction, and health. Antecedents were health status, relaxed state of mind, psychological stress state, and events in life. The consequences were confirmed to be the quality of life, life satisfaction, and promotion of well-being. This study confirms the concept of subject well-being, to provide a cornerstone of the nursing intervention program development and further research. We propose that the concept of subject well-being to be dispersed and its related research may be facilitated through this study, which enables future advanced studies such as tool development for measuring subject well-being or intervention studies for verification purposes."
