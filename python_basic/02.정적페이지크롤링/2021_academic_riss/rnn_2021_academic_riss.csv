RNN모델에서 하이퍼파라미터 변화에 따른 정확도와 손실 성능 분석,2021,[],,"In this paper, in order to obtain the optimization of the RNN model used for sentiment analysis, the correlation of each model was studied by observing the trend of loss and accuracy according to hyperparameter tuning. As a research method, after configuring the hidden layer with LSTM and the embedding layer that are most optimized to process sequential data, the loss and accuracy of each model were measured by tuning the unit, batch-size, and embedding size of the LSTM. As a result of the measurement, the loss was 41.9% and the accuracy was 11.4%, and the trend of the optimization model showed a consistently stable graph, confirming that the tuning of the hyperparameter had a profound effect on the model. In addition, it was confirmed that the decision of the embedding size among the three hyperparameters had the greatest influence on the model. In the future, this research will be continued, and research on an algorithm that allows the model to directly find the optimal hyperparameter will continue."
MI 센서기반의 금속탐지를 위한 RNN 알고리즘 설계에 관한연구,2021,"['딥러닝', '전자기유도', '자기임피던스센서', '다중센서', '순환신경망', 'Deep Learning', 'Electromagnetic Induction', 'MI Sensor', 'Multi Sensor', 'RNN']",,"This paper is a study of metal detection methods using multiple MI sensors using deep learning. The MI sensor is a sensor that measures the impedance change of an atypical wire by the electrical conduction and transmittance of a detector. Simple principles, small power consumption, and compact manufacturing are possible. This is a field-available sensor that requires limited weight and power, such as a mobile environment. However, sensors are generally weak in strength due to the nature of sensors that detect changes in magnetic fields. This paper compares and analyzes the detection performance with the depth of each network for location detection via RNN on 16-channel raw data extracted from sensors in a self-impedance manner."
Rapid warning of wind turbine blade icing based on MIV-tSNE-RNN,2021,['· Dimension reduction · Miv-tSNE-RNN · Rapid prediction · SCADA · Wind turbine blade icing'],,"A fast early warning algorithm for wind turbine blade icing based on a RNN model is proposed. Through wind turbine blade history data and labels as model input, the evaluation of raw m-dimension data through mean impact value (MIV) indices eliminates data with an MIV index of less than one; the remaining n-dimension data is reduced to x-dimension by the tSNE method; dimensional data is inputted into the RNN, and the model output is the icing state of the wind turbine blade in a certain future period. Based on the SCADA data from a wind field, the model was verified by an example. Using a certain example case, if the model training data is 10 4 orders of magnitude, using the MIV-tSNE-RNN algorithm, the prediction accuracy can reach approximately 72 %; compared with the RNN model, the prediction accuracy is improved by approximately 150 % while reducing the algorithm running time by approximately 45 %. If the amount of data exceeds 10 4 orders of magnitude, using the MIVtSNE-RNN algorithm, the prediction accuracy is improved by approximately 100 %. This algorithm can provide accurate and rapid prediction results for wind turbine blade icing according to actual needs."
Predictive model for PV power generation using RNN (LSTM),2021,['· Recurrent neural network · Deep learning · Model predictive control · Renewable energy · PV power generation'],,"In recent years, advanced information technologies, such as deep learning and big data, have been actively applied in building energy management systems to improve energy efficiency. Various studies have been conducted on the prediction of renewable energy performance using machine learning techniques. In this study, a recurrent neural network (RNN) was utilized in predicting photovoltaic (PV) power generation. An RNN is an artificial neural network in which the connection between units is composed of a cyclic structure that can reflect the characteristics of time series. Therefore, to eventually incorporate a model predictive control technique for energy demand and supply matching, this study uses previously measured weather data and PV power generation data to predict the future PV power generation.Various optimization processes, such as normalization, classification of learning data, and setting of layer options, are performed to create a predictive model. Furthermore, 500 hidden neurons and 1 and 3 hidden layers are created and compared. The initial learning rate for both single and multiple-layer options was set to 0.05. As a result, the coefficient of variation of the root mean squared error, Cv(RMSE), which is a statistical index to assess the overall accuracy of the predicted values, was 13.8 % for a single layer and 13.2 % for a multiple-layer long short term memory model. Although no significant difference was observed between the two models, the multiple-layer model showed a slightly reduced error rate than the single-layer model, and the accurate prediction was confirmed to be achievable. Based on this study, a stable energy supply system can be established through linkage with energy storage control by predicting the amount of energy production through renewable energy sources and the amount of energy demand at urban scale."
Ultraviolet Light-Responsive Photorheological Fluid for Sensors and Actuators Realized by Phosphorescence Effects and LSTM RNN,2021,"['smart fluid', 'photorheological fluid', 'phosphorescence', 'linearization', 'LSTM RNN']",,"A photo-rheological fluid (PRF) is a smart fluid which exhibits different viscosity under UV irradiation. A PRF is comprehensively presented in this work, with particular focus on its responses under UV off/on conditions. The isomeric conversion from SP to MC and vice versa under UV off and on, respectively, showed unequal rates of transformation. As a result, a complex non-linear hysteretic response was observed. To be used indifferent types of sensors and actuators which can exploit its rheological properties, it is essential the PRF have linearized hysteresis behavior. To minimize the asymmetric non-linear hysteresis characteristics under UV on and off conditions, the well-known long-lasting phosphor SAO (SrAl2O4:Eu2+, Dy3+) was incorporated. The incorporation of SAO in the PRF improved the linearity of the PRF response, although the conversion rate was not identical under UV off/on conditions. The SAO particles were observed to settle over time due to phase splitting, undermining the usefulness of the SAO-PRF composite. Instead of improving the PRF response by further adjusting the PRF composite, a software approach based on Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM RNN) was employed to model and compensate the asymmetric non-linear hysteresis response, ensuring the realization of sensors and actuators that exploit PRF as hardware."

Especially, due to the rapidly changing business environments and the recent COVID-19 pandemic, many domestic companies are facing financial adversity. Thus, the necessity of research on corporate insolvency is being emphasized. As a related research, there is a prediction of corporate bankruptcy, however, a bankrupt company is the company whose business activities have been suspended, and there is a limitation in which it is inappropriate to determine which companies show signs of bankruptcy among continuing companies. Therefore, marginal company, one of the categories of insolvent companies, is selected as the prediction target. Marginal companies are the firms that are operating income interest compensation ratio are less than 1 for three consecutive years, and are engaged in business activities but have not consistently secured adequate profits. In this study, deep learning techniques are used to predict them. It is one of the machine learning techniques that has recently attracted attention because of its excellence in various fields. Nonetheless, has not been applied in research to predict marginal companies. This study applies RNN and CNN among deep learning techniques using several financial ratios as independent variables. Their performance are compared with machine learning ensemble models that have been reported to have excellent predictive power in previous studies. As a result of analysis on corporate data from 2017 to 2019 as training and test data, deep learning models such as RNN-LSTM, RNN-GRU, and CNN are better in forecasting of marginal companies than the ensemble models in terms of Recall score. Therefore, the deep learning models are expected to become widely used in the prediction of marginal companies in the future."

Development and Validation of a Deep Learning Based Diabetes Prediction System Using a Nationwide Population-Based Cohort,2021,"['Diabetes mellitus', 'type 2', 'Mass screening', 'Prediabetic state', 'Prediction']",,"Background Previously developed prediction models for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have limited performance. We developed a deep learning (DL) based model using a cohort representative of the Korean population.Methods This study was conducted on the basis of the National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening (NHIS-HEALS) cohort of Korea. Overall, 335,302 subjects without T2DM at baseline were included. We developed the model based on 80% of the subjects, and verified the power in the remainder. Predictive models for T2DM were constructed using the recurrent neural network long short-term memory (RNN-LSTM) network and the Cox longitudinal summary model. The performance of both models over a 10-year period was compared using a time dependent area under the curve.Results During a mean follow-up of 10.4±1.7 years, the mean frequency of periodic health check-ups was 2.9±1.0 per subject. During the observation period, T2DM was newly observed in 8.7% of the subjects. The annual performance of the model created using the RNN-LSTM network was superior to that of the Cox model, and the risk factors for T2DM, derived using the two models were similar; however, certain results differed.Conclusion The DL-based T2DM prediction model, constructed using a cohort representative of the population, performs better than the conventional model. After pilot tests, this model will be provided to all Korean national health screening recipients in the future."

A prototype of a real-time respiratory motion compensation couch was built using an optical 3D motion tracking system and a six-degree-of-freedom-articulated robotic system. To compensate for the system latency from motion detection to re-positioning of the system, RNN and double exponential smoothing (ES2) prediction algorithms were applied. Three aspects of performance were evaluated, simulation and experiments for geometric and dosimetric evaluations, using data from three liver and three lung patients who underwent stereotactic body radiotherapy. Overall, the RNN algorithm showed better geometric and dosimetric results than the other approaches. In simulation tests, RNN showed 82% average improvement ratio, compared with non-predicted results. In the geometric evaluation, RNN only showed average FWHM broadening of 1.5 mm, compared with the static case.In the dosimetric evaluation, RNN showed average gamma passing rates of 97.4 ± 1.0%, 89.0 ± 2.4% under the 3%/3 mm, 2%/2 mm respectively. It may be technically feasible to use the RNN prediction algorithm to compensate for respiratory motion with an articulated robotic couch system.

In the shipping industry, since fuel oil accounts for the largest portion of ship operation costs and its price is highly volatile, so companies can secure market competitiveness by making fuel oil purchasing decisions based on rational and scientific method. In this paper, short-term predictive analysis of HSFO 380CST in Singapore is conducted by using three recurrent neural network models like RNN, LSTM, and GRU. As a result, first, the forecasting performance of RNN models is better than LSTM and GRUs using long-term memory, and thus the predictive contribution of long-term information is low. Second, since the predictive performance of recurrent neural network models is superior to the previous studies using econometric models, it is confirmed that the recurrent neural network models should consider nonlinear properties of bunker price. The result of this paper will be helpful to improve the decision quality of bunker purchasing."

Data-Driven Self-sensing Technique for Active Magnetic Bearing,2021,['Data-driven sensor · Self-sensing · Active magnetic bearing · RNN'],,"In the last two decades, soft sensors proved themselves as a valuable alternative to the physical sensor for gathering critical process information. A self-sensing technique for the magnetic bearing is considered as a soft sensor since the object position is estimated from the current signal of the electromagnet. Self-sensing techniques developed so far are the model-driven soft sensors. This paper presents a data-driven self-sensing technique to compensate for the nonlinear characteristic of the electromagnet. First, model-driven self-sensing techniques and their problems are reviewed. Then, data-driven self-sensing technique using recurrent neural network (RNN) is proposed to compensate for the nonlinear characteristics. Both the position control and self-sensing with the RNN are implemented in a single digital signal processor. The effectiveness of the proposed method is experimentally verified by comparison with the current slope method. Both estimation errors during initial levitation and jitter after levitation are reduced by 90% and 36%, respectively. Estimation error with 2 Hz sine wave is improved by 65.9%, while jitter during self-sensing levitation is cut down to 26.8%."

심층신경망을 이용한 PCB 부품의 인쇄문자 인식,2021,"['Deep Neural Networks', 'OCR', 'LPRNet', 'CRNN', 'Text Recognition']",,"Recognition of characters printed or marked on the PCB components from images captured using cameras is an important task in PCB components inspection systems. Previous optical character recognition (OCR) of PCB components typically consists of two stages: character segmentation and classification of each segmented character. However, character segmentation often fails due to corrupted characters, low image contrast, etc. Thus, OCR without character segmentation is desirable and increasingly used via deep neural networks. Typical implementation based on deep neural nets without character segmentation includes convolutional neural network followed by recurrent neural network (RNN). However, one disadvantage of this approach is slow execution due to RNN layers. LPRNet is a segmentation-free character recognition network with excellent accuracy proved in license plate recognition. LPRNet uses a wide convolution instead of RNN, thus enabling fast inference. In this paper, LPRNet was adapted for recognizing characters printed on PCB components with fast execution and high accuracy. Initial training with synthetic images followed by fine-tuning on real text images yielded accurate recognition. This net can be further optimized on Intel CPU using OpenVINO tool kit. The optimized version of the network can be run in real-time faster than even GPU."

Robustness of Differentiable Neural Computer Using Limited Retention Vector-based Memory Deallocation in Language Model,2021,"['Differentiable Neural Computer', 'DNC', 'Language Model', 'LM', 'Memory Deallocation', 'Retention Vector', 'Robustness']",,"Recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures have been used for language modeling (LM) tasks that require learning long-range word or character sequences. However, the RNN architecture is still suffered from unstable gradients on long-range sequences. To address the issue of long-range sequences, an attention mechanism has been used, showing state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all LM tasks. A differentiable neural computer (DNC) is a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism. The DNC architecture is a neural network augmented with a content-addressable external memory. However, in the write operation, some information unrelated to the input word remains in memory. Moreover, DNCs have been found to perform poorly with low numbers of weight parameters. Therefore, we propose a robust memory deallocation method using a limited retention vector. The limited retention vector determines whether the network increases or decreases its usage of information in external memory according to a threshold. We experimentally evaluate the robustness of a DNC implementing the proposed approach according to the size of the controller and external memory on the enwik8 LM task. When we decreased the number of weight parameters by 32.47%, the proposed DNC showed a low bits-per-character (BPC) degradation of 4.30%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in language modeling tasks."

The End2End paradigm is a strategy that directly maps raw sensor data to vehicle control actions. This strategy is very promising and appealing because complex module design and cumbersome data labeling are avoided. Since this approach lacks a degree of interpretability, safety and practicability. we propose an autonomous driving approach based on trajectory learning using deep neural networks in this paper. In comparison to End2End algorithm, it is found that the trajectory learning algorithm performs better in autonomous driving. As for trajectory learning algorithm, the CNN_Raw-RNN network structure is established, which is verified to be more effective than the original CNN_LSTM network structure. Besides, we propose an autonomous driving architecture of a pilot and copilot combination. The pilot is responsible for trajectory prediction via imitation learning with labeled driving trajectories, while the copilot is a safety module that is employed to verify the effectiveness of the vehicle trajectory by the results of the semantic segmentation auxiliary task. The proposed autonomous driving architecture is verified with a real car on urban roads without manual intervention within 40 km."

"『길 위 1번지』, AI 제임스의 소설 : 「소설의 기술」과 인공신경망 알고리즘의 글쓰기",2021,"['Henry James', '“The Art of Fiction', '” 1 the Road', 'CNN', 'RNN', 'Creativity']",,"This article explores the implications of 1 the Road (2018), a fiction produced by an artificial neural network, for the debate on machine creativity. Unlike most of the recent deeplearning writing programs, its creator Ross Goodwin traveled with this neural network machine from New York to New Orleans in a Cadillac equipped with a surveillance camera, a voice recognizer, and GPS. The AI thus had continuous feeds of fresh images and sounds, not unlike a novelist who hits the road searching for an experience. I argue that we can better understand this attempt of 1 the Road when discussed alongside Henry James’s realist notion of fiction in his essay “The Art of Fiction” (1884). Even though James is often considered an arch-humanist in his belief that fiction is an expression of the unique personality of a novelist, his idea of experience offers a way of understanding Goodwin’s machine as a creative writer. Its algorithmic operation―processing the new sense data via the CNN algorithm and producing the result as writing via the RNN algorithm―is strikingly similar to the workings of the novelist’s mind in James’s view. I do not argue that those sense data are unmediated, and this fact is reflected in the CNN’s algorithm that imitates the human mind. In fact, James asserts that sensory data are the result of mediated selection, which can only be seen through the final result, the writing itself. What I propose is that regardless of whether the machine has a so-called “consciousness,” its writing can affect the reader in similar ways as does a text written by a human being. As long as it works as a linguistic medium to relate the “experience,” which is the algorithmic process of selection and transcription, it is a creative writer."

Therefore, in this study, the probability of future heatwave onset was predicted using daily scaled past weather data for Seoul Metropolitan Government. For the analysis, models based on recurrent neural networks (RNN, LSTM, GRU) were used, which are suitable for analyzing time-series data. Upon evaluating the performance of the GRU model, which was selected as the optimized model, no overfitting problem was observed. The prediction accuracy of the model was high as it demonstrated a reproduction of 78% and 86% of actual heatwave days during the validation and test process, respectively. Therefore, this model can be used by each local government to coordinate an efficient response to heat waves."

Efficiency Optimization Control of an IPMSM Drive System for Electric Vehicles (EVs),2021,"['Current optimization', 'electric vehicles (EVs)', 'interior permanent magnet synchronous motors (IPMSMs)', 'parameter identification', 'recursive neural network.']",,"Electric vehicles are a key technology to decarbonize the transport sector where interior permanent magnet synchronous motors (IPMSMs) are the best performer at the heart of the electrical drive system. In order to optimize their operational efficiency, the model-based method associated with parameter identification is widely adopted. However, efficiency optimization and parameter identification in the existing methods are implemented independently by different strategies in a sequential execution manner, which does not produce an optimized systemlevel solution. In this paper, the two methods are combined to deal with a constrained optimization problem in an IPMSM drive. Firstly, the problem is converted into a variational problem based on the variational principle and projection dynamic theory. Then, a unified projection dynamic equation (UPDE) is used to estimate the parameters and determine the solution of optimal current (OC) of the IPMSM. Further, a recursive neural network (RNN)corresponding to the UPDE is developed to implement the developed fast efficiency optimization of the IPMSM drive. The results of simulation experiments show the proposed method is effective to identify motor parameters and determine the OC of the drive system rapidly and accurately. Thus, it can rapidly realize efficiency optimization of an IPMSM drive-system. Because the designed RNN can be easily implemented in the hardware, such as a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or dedicated neural network chip, the method can achieve instantaneousefficiency optimization of the IPMSM drive system and therefore improve the widespread application of IPMSMs in EVs."

An artificial neural network (ANN) can effectively recognize multiple faults of a system and build a training model with training data for decision-making. The ANN comprises an encoder and a decoder. The encoder uses a gated recurrent unit, which is a recurrent neural network, for dimensionality reduction of the input data. The decoder uses a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for diagnosis decision-making. To create data, we use a wind turbine simulator that enables fully coupled nonlinear time-domain numerical simulations of offshore wind turbines considering six fault types including biases and fixed outputs in pitch sensors and excessive friction, slit lock, incorrect voltage, and short circuits in actuators. The input data are time-series data collected by two sensors and two control inputs under the condition that of one fault of the six types occurs. A gated recurrent unit (GRU) that is one of the RNNs classifies the suggested faults of the blade pitch system. The performance of fault classification based on the gate recurrent unit is evaluated by a test procedure, and the results indicate that the proposed scheme works effectively. The proposed ANN shows a 1.4% improvement in its performance compared to an MLP-based approach."

After introducing the attention mechanism to neural network models, many new models with improved performance have been developed; in addition, models using attention twice have also recently been proposed, resulting in further performance improvements. In this paper, we consider time series prediction by introducing attention twice to an RNN model. The proposed model is a method that introduces H-attention and T-attention for output value and time step information to select useful information. We conduct experiments on stock price, temperature and energy data and confirm that the proposed model outperforms existing models."
가구당 기기별 에너지 사용량 예측을 위한 딥러닝 모델의 설계 및 구현,2021,"['에너지 모니터링', '에너지 사용량 예측', '에너지 관리 시스템', '머신러닝 모델', 'Energy Moniotring', 'Energy consumption prediction', 'Energy Management System', 'Machine Learning Model']",,"Korea is both a resource-poor country and a energy-consuming country. In addition, the use and dependence on electricity is very high, and more than 20% of total energy use is consumed in buildings. As research on deep learning and machine learning is active, research is underway to apply various algorithms to energy efficiency fields, and the introduction of building energy management systems (BEMS) for efficient energy management is increasing. In this paper, we constructed a database based on energy usage by device per household directly collected using smart plugs. We also implement algorithms that effectively analyze and predict the data collected using RNN and LSTM models. In the future, this data can be applied to analysis of power consumption patterns beyond prediction of energy consumption. This can help improve energy efficiency and is expected to help manage effective power usage through prediction of future data."
종단형 음성인식에서의 인식 유닛에 따른 언어모델 연구,2021,"['종단형 음성인식', '언어모델 퓨전 디코딩', '워드피스 모델', 'end-to-end ASR', 'language model fusion', 'wordpiece model']","본 논문에서는 종단형 음성인식에서의 인식 유닛 선정과 인식 성능과의 관계를 영어 및 한국어 음성인식 환경에서 살펴보았다. 종단형 음성인식의 인식 유닛은 글자(character), 형태소, 단어 등으로 정의하여 모델 학습을 할 수 있다. 본 논문에서는 이 중 기본이 되는 글자(character) 유닛과 데이터로부터 정의 가능한 wordpiece model(WPM)을 비교 실험하였다. 종단형 음성인식 방법은 디코딩 과정에서 외부 언어모델과 fusion을 통한 디코딩이 가능하다. 글자 유닛과 wordpiece 유닛에 대해 적절한 언어모델을 학습 후 언어모델 fusion 기반 음성인식을 수행하였다. 글자 유닛을 적용하는 종단형 음성인식의 경우 종단형 모델의 출력 유닛 개수가 적어 빠르게 모델이 수렴하는 특징이 있다. 영어 음성인식 환경에서는 글자 유닛을 적용한 종단형 모델 성능이 wordpiece 유닛을 적용한 종단형 모델 보다 낮게 관측되었다. 적절한 언어모델을 적용하여 디코딩을 수행하는 경우 양쪽 모두 유사한 최종 성능을 얻었으나, 언어모델의 유닛 개수 차이로 인하여 wordpiece 모델을 출력 유닛으로 하는 종단형 음성인식 모델이 인식 속도 측면에서 상대적으로 좋은 성능을 보였다.","In this paper, we investigate a recognition unit to learn an end-to-end speech recognition model. In end-to-end speech recognition, we can model the output unit as characters (or syllable in Korean), part-of-speech (POS), and words. We compare the character unit and wordpiece model (WPM) that can be trained from the data. End-to-end speech recognition can combine the score of an end-to-end model with the score of an external language model (LM). For LM fusion decoding, we train recurrent neural network (RNN) language models with the appropriate language model level (character/POS/word/WPM). An end-to-end speech recognition model with a character unit is converged fast because of a smaller output unit number. End-to-end speech recognition with the character unit has lower accuracy than end-to-end speech recognition with the wordpiece unit. With the language model in decoding, two models have comparable performance and the end-to-end model with wordpiece unit has an advantage in terms of the decoding speed."
A Classification Method for Power-Quality Disturbances Using Hilbert–Huang Transform and LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks,2021,"['Long short term memory', 'Recurrent neural networks', 'Disturbances classifi cation', 'Hilbert–Huang Transform', 'Power Quality', 'Mode mixing']",,"Power quality disturbances are one of the main problems in an electric power system, where deviations in the voltage and current signals can be evidenced. These sudden changes are potential causes of malfunctions and could aff ect equipment performance at diff erent demand locations. For this reason, a classifi cation strategy is essential to provide relevant information related to the occurrence of the disturbance. Nevertheless, traditional data extraction and detection methods have failed to carry out the classifi cation process with the performance required, in terms of accuracy and effi ciency, due to the presence of a non-stationary and non-linear dynamics, specifi c of these signals. This paper proposes a hybrid approach that involves the implementation of the Hilbert–Huang Transform (HHT) and long short-term memory (LSTM), recurrent neural networks (RNN) to detect and classify power quality disturbances. Nine types of synthetic signals were reproduced and pre-processed taking into account the mathematical models and their specifi cations established in the IEEE 1159 standard. In order to eliminate the presence of mode mixing, the ensemble empirical decomposition (EEMD) and masking signal methods were implemented. Additionally, based on the successful benefi ts of LSTM RNNs reported in the literature, associated to the high accuracy rates achieved at learning long short-term dependencies, this classifi cation technique is implemented to analyze the sequences obtained from the HHT. Based on the experimental results, it is possible to show that the ensemble recognition approach using the EEMD yields a better classifi cation accuracy rate (98.85%) compared with the masking signal and the traditional HHT approach"
Semantic Segmentation 기반 딥러닝을 활용한 건축 Building Information Modeling 부재 분류성능 개선 방안,2021,[],,"In order to maximize the use of BIM, all data related to individual elements in the model must be correctly assigned, and it is essential to check whether it corresponds to the IFC entity classification. However, as the BIM modeling process is performed by a large number of participants, it is difficult to achieve complete integrity. To solve this problem, studies on semantic integrity verification are being conducted to examine whether elements are correctly classified or IFC mapped in the BIM model by applying an artificial intelligence algorithm to the 2D image of each element. Existing studies had a limitation in that they could not correctly classify some elements even though the geometrical differences in the images were clear. This was found to be due to the fact that the geometrical characteristics were not properly reflected in the learning process because the range of the region to be learned in the image was not clearly defined. In this study, the CRF-RNN-based semantic segmentation was applied to increase the clarity of element region within each image, and then applied to the MVCNN algorithm to improve the classification performance. As a result of applying semantic segmentation in the MVCNN learning process to 889 data composed of a total of 8 BIM element types, the classification accuracy was found to be 0.92, which is improved by 0.06 compared to the conventional MVCNN."
Development of a Hybrid Deep-Learning Model for the Human Activity Recognition based on the Wristband Accelerometer Signals,2021,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Human Activity Recognition', 'Smartwatch', 'Accelerometer', 'Machine Learning', 'Activity Classification', 'Feature Extraction', 'Feature Reduction']",,"This study aims to develop a human activity recognition (HAR) system as a Deep-Learning (DL) classification model, distinguishing various human activities. We solely rely on the signals from a wristband accelerometer worn by a person for the user's convenience. 3-axis sequential acceleration signal data are gathered within a predefined time-window-slice, and they are used as input to the classification system. We are particularly interested in developing a Deep-Learning model that can outperform conventional machine learning classification performance. A total of 13 activities based on the laboratory experiments' data are used for the initial performance comparison. We have improved classification performance using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with an auto-encoder feature reduction and parameter tuning. With various publically available HAR datasets, we could also achieve significant improvement in HAR classification. Our CNN model is also compared against Recurrent-Neural-Network(RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) to demonstrate its superiority. Noticeably, our model could distinguish both general activities and near-identical activities such as sitting down on the chair and floor, with almost perfect classification accuracy."
Human Laughter Generation using Hybrid Generative Models,2021,"['Laughter Synthesis', 'Variational Autoencoder', 'Autoencoder', 'Objective and Subjective Evaluation']",,"Laughter is one of the most important nonverbal sound that human generates. It is a means for expressing his emotions. The acoustic and contextual features of this specific sound are different from those of speech and many difficulties arise during their modeling process. During this work, we propose an audio laughter generation system based on unsupervised generative models: the autoencoder (AE) and its variants. This procedure is the association of three main sub-process, (1) the analysis which consist of extracting the log magnitude spectrogram from the laughter database, (2) the generative models training, (3) the synthesis stage which incorporate the involvement of an intermediate mechanism: the vocoder. To improve the synthesis quality, we suggest two hybrid models (LSTM-VAE, GRU-VAE and CNN-VAE) that combine the representation learning capacity of variational autoencoder (VAE) with the temporal modelling ability of a long short-term memory RNN (LSTM) and the CNN ability to learn invariant features. To figure out the performance of our proposed audio laughter generation process, objective evaluation (RMSE) and a perceptual audio quality test (listening test) were conducted. According to these evaluation metrics, we can show that the GRU-VAE outperforms the other VAE models."
Design of e-commerce business model through AI price prediction of agricultural products,2021,"['Agricultural product price', 'AI prediction', 'e-Commerce', 'Prediction model', 'AI algorithm', '농산물 가격', 'AI 예측', '전자거래', '예측 모델', '인공지능 알고리즘']",,"For agricultural products, supply is irregular due to changes in meteorological conditions, and it has high price elasticity. For example, if the supply decreases by 10%, the price increases by 50%. Due to these fluctuations in the prices of agricultural products, the Korean government guarantees the safety of prices to producers through small merchants' auctions. However, when prices plummet due to overproduction, protection measures for producers are insufficient. Therefore, in this paper, we designed a business model that can be used in the electronic transaction system by predicting the price of agricultural products with an artificial intelligence algorithm. To this end, the trained model with the training pattern pairs and a predictive model was designed by applying ARIMA, SARIMA, RNN, and CNN. Finally, the agricultural product forecast price data was classified into short-term forecast and medium-term forecast and verified. As a result of verification, based on 2018 data, the actual price and predicted price showed an accuracy of 91.08%."

Early defense or prediction of increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks is extremely important, and in many cases, the analysis of network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDS) related data alone cannot prevent rapidly changing cyber attacks. Therefore, we are currently using data generated by intrusion detection systems to protect against cyber attacks described above through Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) data analysis. In this paper, we conducted a comparative study on machine learning algorithms using LID-DS (Leipzig Intrusion Detection-Data Set) host-based intrusion detection data including thread information, metadata, and buffer data missing from previously used data sets. The algorithms used were Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron), Logistic Regression, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory model), and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network). Accuracy, accuracy, recall, F1-Score indicators and error rates were measured for evaluation. As a result, the LSTM algorithm had the highest accuracy."

Seismic response reduction capacity of a semi-active mid-story isolation system mainly depends on effect of control algorithm. AI(Artificial Intelligence)-based control algorithm was developed for control of a semi-active mid-story isolation system in this study. For this research, an practical structure of Shiodome Sumitomo building in Japan which has a mid-story isolation system was used as an example structure. An MR (magnetorheological) damper was used to make a semi-active mid-story isolation system in example model. In numerical simulation, seismic response prediction model was generated by one of supervised learning model, i.e. an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network). Deep Q-network (DQN) out of reinforcement learning algorithms was employed to develop control algorithm The numerical simulation results presented that the DQN algorithm can effectively control a semi-active mid-story isolation system resulting in successful reduction of seismic responses."

딥러닝을 활용한 고위험 질병 관리를 예측하는 실시간 헬스케어 플렛폼 시스템,2021,"['Diabetes', 'Real-time', 'Continuous glucose monitoring(CGM)', 'MQTT', 'Deep learning', 'IoT', 'Prediction', 'Feed forward neural network']",,"In recent years, diabetic patients attach CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring) devices to continuously monitor the patient's blood sugar level. Attached to the patient's body in the form of a patch, it provides blood glucose levels and trends in capillaries every 5 minutes, while simultaneously providing hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia alarm functions for continuous blood glucose monitoring through CGM. Recently, research on blood sugar prediction and treatment methods by applying such continuous blood sugar data to deep learning is being actively studied. In this paper, a deep learning-based real-time, high-risk prediction healthcare platform for diabetic high-risk patients for quick action and efficient management is designed and implemented. Blood glucose data of patients is collected through the CGM(Continuous Glucose Monitoring) device and the collected data is delivered to the deep learning predictive model stored in the platform using the IoT gateway and MQTT broker. The deep learning prediction model receives the transmitted blood glucose level data and learns from FFNN(Feed Forward Neural Network) to predict the blood glucose level after PH 5, 15, 30 and 45 minutes. If the prediction results are in a high-risk state, push notification is sent to the healthcare worker's device. Also, blood glucose data is saved in a repository and healthcare workers can retrieve patient's historical blood glucose data. In the future, the neural network used in the deep learning prediction model will be replaced with RNN or LSTM, which is a neural network more suitable for time series data such as blood sugar data."

Next, we applied the GRAB vector to the sentiment analysis task, which is an NLP task, and we proposed a more accurate and robust model, GRAB-BERT(GRAB vector-BERT model). Then, to analyze the effect of the GRAB vector on this model, we compared the performances of recurrent neural network models(RNNs) and BERT models with or without the application of the GRAB vector on both English and Korean text samples with different sequence sizes. Our results demonstrate that applying the GRAB vector to models such as BERT to process inputs in parallel improves the robustness of the model and its performance. Furthermore, unlike BERT-based models, RNN models are more effective when applying graph-based extracted summaries than when applying morpheme-based summaries."
