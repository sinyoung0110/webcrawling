FEM Simulation and Test Verification of PD Ultrasonic Signal Propagation in a Power Transformer Model,2021,"['Power transformers', 'Partial discharge', 'FEM', 'Propagation property']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Ultrasonic signals will be generated when partial discharge occurs in internal insulation faults in large oil immersed power transformers: because the ultrasonic signal has strong anti-interference ability and has no direct electromagnetic contact with the equipment, it is widely used in transformer fault detection and positioning. In this paper, the fi nite element method (FEM) is used to simulate the ultrasonic signal in a 35 kV power transformer. The infl uence of transformer case on ultrasonic signal propagation is considered, and the propagation law of the ultrasonic signal inside the transformer is obtained. Fabry–Pérot (F–P) fi bre acoustic sensors with a centre frequency of 28 kHz were fabricated. A partial discharge detection test was carried out in a 35 kV transformer winding model using the F–P sensors. The test results show that the ultrasonic waveform detected by the F–P sensors are in good agreement with the simulation results, and the propagation of the ultrasonic wave inside the transformer is verifi ed. It lays a foundation for detecting and locating PDs in power transformer by F–P acoustic sensors."
Analytical loss model of series-resonant indirect-matrix-type power electronics transformers using MOSFETs,2021,"['Analytical loss model', 'MOSFET', 'Series-resonant dc-dc converter', 'Indirect-matrix converter', 'Power electronics transformer', 'High efficiency']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"A MOSFET-based series-resonant indirect-matrix-type power electronic transformer (PET) consists of line-frequency-switching folding-unfolding bridges and series-resonant dc-dc converters (SRCs), which is an attractive choice to achieve ac-ac conversion due to its high efficiency and high power density. However, the conduction losses, switching losses, and core losses in each of the high-frequency switching cycles T<sub>s</sub> are different due to the pulsating dc voltage |ac|, which introduces difficulties in the calculation of losses. In addition, the small dc capacitors also participate in the resonance, and the resonant current shape deviates from a pure sine. Therefore, the conventional loss model is not suitable for PETs. In this paper, the time-domain analysis of SRC resonant current considering the dc capacitor is developed. Then, the analytical expression of the resonant current RMS value in grid cycle T<sub>g</sub> is derived, which is more accurate in calculating conduction loss than the conventional model. In addition, it avoids the calculating losses in each T<sub>s</sub>. Next, an analytical switching loss model is developed based on the curve fitting of the capacitance-voltage relationship. A simplified analytical core loss model is provided. Each part of the loss of the PET is verified by thermal simulations, and the total losses are verified by efficiency tests on an experiment prototype."

Temporal Fusion Transformer 모델을 활용한 다층 수평 시계열 데이터 분석,2021,[],"시계열 형태의 데이터는 다양한 분야에서 수집되고 응용되기 때문에 정확한 시계열 예측은 많은 분야에서 운영 효율성을 높일 수 있는 중요한 분석 방법으로 고려된다. 그중 다층 수평 예측은 사용자에게 전반적인 시계열 데이터 경향성을 제공할 수 있다. 하지만 다양한 정보를 포함하는 시계열 데이터는 데이터에 내재한 이질성(heterogeneity)까지 포괄적으로 고려한 방법을 통해서만 정확한 예측을 할 수 있다. 하지만 지금까지 많은 시계열 분석 모델들이 데이터의 이질성을 반영하지 못했다. 이러한 한계를 보완하고자 우리는 Temporal Fusion Transformer 모델을 사용하여 실생활과 밀접한 관련이 있는 데이터에 적용하여 이질성을 고려한 향상된 예측을 수행하였다. 실제, 주식 데이터와 미세 먼지 데이터와 같은 실생활 시계열 데이터에 적용하였고 실험 결과 기존 모델보다 Mean Squared Error(MSE)가 0.3487 낮은 것을 확인하였다.",다국어 초록 정보 없음
Novel fuzzy direct torque control based on constructed functional transformed grey model,2021,"['Grey prediction', 'GM(1', '1) model', 'Fuzzy control', 'Direct torque control', 'Functional transformation', 'Equal dimensional new information']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"To reduce the ripple of the magnetic flux and torque of motors and the reduce the hysteresis in motor speed control, an improved grey model predictive fuzzy direct torque control (DTC) method based on function transformation is proposed. First, a function transformation is used to transform the sampled sequences to nonnegative values. This overcomes the disadvantages caused by fluctuant and random sampling of the motor torque and stator flux linkage. Second, an equal dimensional new information model is used to keep the dimensions unchanged, which reduces the time to predict the motor parameters through the model. Moreover, the voltage space vector plane is divided into six sectors, which simplifies the fuzzy control system rules. Simulation results show that the proposed fuzzy direct torque control based on the improved grey model method reduces the influence of hysteresis on the control system, decreases the motor flux chain and torque ripple, improves the response speed of the torque and rotational speed, reduces overshoot, achieves good effects in terms of anti-interference capability and dynamic response, and improves the real-time performance and accuracy of the fuzzy control system."

Transforming growth factor-beta and liver injury in an arginine vasopressin-induced pregnant rat model,2021,"['Arginase 1', 'Arginine vasopressin', 'Aspartate transaminase 1', 'Liver injury', 'Transforming growth factor beta']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Objective: Approximately 30% of preeclamptic pregnancies exhibit abnormal liver function tests. We assessed liver injury-associated enzyme levels and circulating transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) levels in an arginine vasopressin (AVP)-induced pregnant Sprague-Dawley rat model.Methods: Pregnant and non-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats (n=24) received AVP (150 ng/hr) subcutaneously via mini-osmotic pumps for 18 days. Blood pressure was measured, urine samples were collected, and all animals were euthanized via isoflurane. Blood was collected to measure circulating levels of TGF-β1-3 isomers and liver injury enzymes in pregnant AVP (PAVP), pregnant saline (PS), non-pregnant AVP (NAVP), and non-pregnant saline (NS) rats. Results: The PAVP group showed significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure than both saline-treated groups. The weight per pup was significantly lower in the AVP-treated group than in the saline group (p<0.05). Circulating TGF-β1-3 isomer levels were significantly higher in the PAVP rats than in the NS rats. However, similar TGF-1 and TGF-3 levels were noted in the PS and PAVP rats, while TGF-2 levels were significantly higher in the PAVP rats. Circulating liver-type arginase-1 and 5'-nucleotidase levels were higher in the PAVP rats than in the saline group. Conclusion: This is the first study to demonstrate higher levels of TGF-β2, arginase, and 5'-nucleotidase activity in PAVP than in PS rats. AVP may cause vasoconstriction and increase peripheral resistance and blood pressure, thereby elevating TGF-β and inducing the preeclampsia-associated inflammatory response. Future studies should explore the mechanisms through which AVP dysregulates liver injury enzymes and TGF-β in pregnant rats."

Recent studies have attempted to borrow the models for natural language processing(NLP) to handle time dependency issues. However, industrial data have different properties compared with NLP data: strongly dependent on a time axis. Moreover, because industrial information is continuously accumulating while the machine is running, it has a much longer sequence than other sequential data. In this study, we compare the performance of widely used natural language models, LSTM and Transformer, on such long-time series industrial data. For comparison, we performed experiments to detect an attack on a water treatment management system and to predict traffic flow on a highway. We confirmed that the Transformer using the attention mechanism showed better performance than the LSTM."

The stress and displacement components are obtained using the thermal stress function in the reduced differential transform domain. All the solutions are obtained in the form of power series. The special case with a time-dependent laser heat source has been considered. The problem is considered for homogeneous material with finite rectangular cross-section heated with a non-Gaussian temporal profile. The effect of the heat source on all the characteristics of a material is discussed numerically and graphically for magnesium material taking a pulse duration of 0.2 ps.

The Educational Global Climate Model (EdGCM) predicts numerically and its performance was not evaluated for Bangladesh earlier. Due to this reason, an attempt has been made to apply a new geostatistical approach with the help of transform software to downscale EdGCM for identifying the trend of surface air temperature at the Sylhet district. Both Doubled_CO₂ and Global_Warming_01 are simulated from EdGCM and maps are generated to depict global temperature variations. Downscaling is applied to the outputs from Doubled_CO₂ scenario. Percent of bias (PBIAS), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and the ratio of root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data (RSR) values are satisfactory and acceptable. The trend analysis was performed using the Mann-Kendall Trend test and Sen’s slope estimator. Temperature changes are significant for both downscaled and observed results of p-value which is less than alpha = 0.05. Mann-Kendall Z tests for annual downscaled and IPCC during (2006-2020) show a positive trend. Downscaled predicted annual average temperature (simulations by Doubled_CO₂) for 2020 is 21.67˚C for the Sylhet district."

The dataset used was collected and classified by relevant experts from the Lister Hill National Centre for Biomedical Communications (LHNCBC). We prepared our samples with minimal image transformations as opposed to others, as we focused more on the feature extraction capability of the EfficientNetB0 baseline model. We applied transfer learning to increase the initial feature sets and reduced the training time to train our model. We then fine-tuned it to work with our proposed layers and re-trained the entire model to learn from our prepared dataset. The highest overall accuracy attained from our evaluated results was 94.70% from fifty epochs and followed by 94.68% within just ten. Additional visualization and analysis using the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) algorithm visualized how effectively our fine-tuned EfficientNetB0 detected infections better than other recent state-of-the-art DCNN models. This study, therefore, concludes that when fine-tuned, the recent EfficientNetB0 will generate highly accurate deep learning solutions for the identification of malaria parasites in blood smears without the need for stringent pre-processing, optimization, or data augmentation of images."

In this study, we investigate the effects of PM<sub>10</sub> inhalation on RNA expression in lung tissues using a murine model.Methods: Female BALB/c mice were affected with PM<sub>10</sub>, ovalbumin (OVA), or both OVA and PM<sub>10</sub>. PM<sub>10</sub> was administered intranasally while OVA was both intraperitoneally injected and intranasally administered. Treatments occurred 4 times over a 2-week period. Two days after the final challenges, mice were sacrificed. Full RNA sequencing using lung homogenates was conducted.Results: While PM<sub>10</sub> did not induce cell proliferation in bronchoalveolar fluid or lead to airway hyper-responsiveness, it did cause airway inflammation and lung fibrosis. Levels of interleukin 1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and transforming growth factor-β in lung homogenates were significantly elevated in the PM<sub>10</sub>-treated group, compared to the control group. The PM<sub>10</sub> group also showed increased RNA expression of Rn45a , Snord22 , Atp6v0c-ps2 , Snora28 , Snord15b , Snora70 , and Mmp12 . Generally, genes associated with RNA splicing, DNA repair, the inflammatory response, the immune response, cell death, and apoptotic processes were highly expressed in the PM<sub>10</sub>-treated group. The OVA/PM<sub>10</sub> treatment did not produce greater effects than OVA alone. However, the OVA/PM<sub>10</sub>-treated group did show increased RNA expression of Clca1, Snord22, Retnla, Prg2, Tff2, Atp6v0c-ps2, and Fcgbp when compared to the control groups. These genes are associated with RNA splicing, DNA repair, the inflammatory response, and the immune response.Conclusion: Inhalation of PM<sub>10</sub> extensively altered RNA expression while also inducing cellular inflammation, fibrosis, and increased inflammatory cytokines in this murine mouse model."

Yarrow oil ameliorates ulcerative colitis in mice model via regulating the NF-κB and PPAR-γ pathways,2021,"['Achillea millefolium', 'Asteraceae', 'Inflammatory bowel diseases', 'NF-kappa B', 'PPAR gamma']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Background/Aims: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder with indefinite etiology; however, environmen-tal, genetic, immune factors and microbial agents could be implicated in its pathogenesis. UC treatment is lifelong, therefore; the potential side effects and cost of the therapy are significant. Yarrow is a promising medicinal plant with the ability to treat many disorders, owing to its bioactive compounds especially the essential oil. The main aim of this research was to investigate the therapeutic effect of the yarrow oil on colitis including the involved mechanism of action. Methods: In 21-female C57BL/6 mice were divided into 3 groups; control group, colitis model group, and oil-treated group. Groups 2 and 3 received 5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for 9 days, and concomitantly, only group 3 was given 100 mg/kg yarrow oil. Mice were examined for their body weight, stool consistency and bleeding, and the disease activity indexes were calculated. Results: Oral administration of yarrow oil markedly repressed the severity of UC via the reduction of the inflammatory signs and restoring colon length. The oil was able to down-regulate nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), up-regulate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), and enhance transforming growth factor-β expression. The oil normalized the tumor necrosis factor-α expression, restored the normal serum level of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and reduced the serum level of IL-6. Conclusions: Yarrow oil mitigated UC symptoms and regulated the inflammatory cytokines secretion via regulation of NF-κB and PPAR-γ pathways in the mice model, however, this recommendation requires further investigations using clinical studies to confirm the use of the oil on humans.

The aim of this study was to explore whether miRNA antagomirs could serve as potential therapeutic agents in interstitial lung diseases.Methods: A mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis was established by intratracheal injection of bleomycin (BLM). Using microarray analysis, up-regulated miRNAs were identified during the development of pulmonary fibrosis. miR-155 was chosen as the candidate miRNA. Fifteen mice were then randomized into the following three groups: BLM + antagomiR-155 group, treated with BLM plus intravenously injected with antagomiR-155; BLM group, treated with intratracheal BLM plus phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); and a control group, treated with PBS only. Lung tissues were collected for histopathological analysis, hydroxyproline measurement, and Western blotting. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used for the measurement of cytokines associated with pulmonary fibrosis.Results: Histological changes and hydroxyproline levels induced by BLM were significantly inhibited by antagomiR-155. The levels of interleukin 4 (IL-4) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) expression were increased after BLM treatment. However, miR-155 silencing decreased the expression of IL-4, TGF-β, and interferon-γ. TGF-β-activated kinase 1/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 7 (MAP3K7)-binding protein 2 (TAB2) of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, was activated by BLM and inhibited by in vivo silencing of miR-155 via antagomiR-155.Conclusions: In vivo treatment with antagomiR-155 alleviated the pathological changes induced by BLM and may be a promising therapeutic strategy for pulmonary fibrosis."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of the budesonide-formoterol combination (BFC) and the fluticasone-salmeterol combination (FSC) therapy in the real-world settings in South Korea.MethodsThis retrospective cohort study was performed using databases transformed to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM) version 5.3.1 that maps international coding systems into standard vocabulary concepts (Figure 1). We used the new-user cohort design that enables comparative efficacy and safety evaluation from the South Korea National Health Insurance Service/National Sample Cohort data. Asthma exacerbation rates, short-acting β2 agonists (SABAs) prescription, and new leukotriene-receptor antagonists (LTRAs) prescription were compared, as assessed in a time-to-event analysis. Safety including pneumonia and bronchitis was also compared.ResultsA total of 16299 eligible patients were included, of whom 4794 per cohort were matched and balanced by propensity score. During 3 years, the rate of asthma exacerbation was lower in the BFC than in the FSC (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-0.95) (Figure 2). Lower prescription rates of SABA (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79-0.94) and additional LTRA (0.84; 0.74- 0.96) were noted in the BFC group than in the FSC group. The safety outcome analysis showed lower risks of pneumonia (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77-0.96) and bronchitis (0.92; 0.86-0.98) in the BFC group than in the FSC group (Figure 3).ConclusionThese results suggest that the BFC is better than the FSC in the treatment of asthma in aspects of efficacy and safety. OMOPCDM in an open collaborative research network can be used to perform a large international study examining the efficacy and safety of inhalation devices for ICS-LABA combination therapy."

As a result, various attempts have been made to automatically summarize a large amount of text. In particular, the abstractive summarization approach is being actively studied because it can create a new summary with rich contextual expressions. In the abstractive summarization task, neural network-based transformer models show high-performance and are used widely. However, if a sufficient amount of training data is not provided, it is difficult to generate a high-quality summary because the parameters constituting the transformer are not sufficiently learned. In this work, we proposes a text summarization method that generates a high-quality summary given a small amount of training data. Specifically, we extract some elements of KoBERT and apply them to a transformer-based abstractive summarization model. We conducted an experiment on 42,803 cases of Dacon's summary data to evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology.

This paper improves the efficiency of the existing white box attack method by proposing an attention constraint using the attention structure of the transformer model. Through experiments, it has been proven that the generation time can be shortened by about 6.5% and the diversity of generated adversarial examples can be increased by 2.4% compared to the previous research results."
Multi-Label Image Classification Using The Base Vision Transformer,2021,"['Vision Transformers', 'Multi-label Classification', 'Neural Networks']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"As the images usually contain multiple objects and traditional approaches of classification suppose that the image has a dominant class, we propose a multi-label classification model based on the state-of-the-art vision transformers (ViT). The proposed model exposes all the object labels that exist in an image rather than the dominant object. The use of the vision transformer model allows the global understanding of the image rather than the convolutional approach which allows only the local understanding of the image based on the convolutional window size. We train and test our model on the challenging PASCAL VOC2012 dataset showing that our approach attains higher mean classification accuracy (97.2%) than the popular convolution-based neural network models."
Transmission Distance Improvement of a Two-Coil Magnetic Resonance Wireless Power Transmission System Using Transformers,2021,"['Magnetic Resonance Modeling', 'Q-Factor', 'Wireless Power Transfer']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In this paper, a two-coil magnetic resonance wireless transmission system is studied to improve the transmission distance using transformers. A conventional two-coil and four-coil wireless power transmission (WPT) system as well as a two-coil WPT system with transformers are analyzed comparatively via circuit simulations and experiments. Circuit analysis was used to predict the transmission distance with the highest efficiency. To verify the improvement in the transmission distance of the proposed system, transformers with inductance values of 80, 100, and 140 μH were fabricated and analyzed through experiments and simulations. A maximum S21 parameter of 0.76 was noted when the inductance was 80 μH and the transmitting distance was 4 cm. The experimental results almost matched the simulation results. From the experiments, it was shown that the transmitting distance of a WPT system can be adjusted by using transformers. Additionally, it was found that the transmitting distance is inversely proportional to the transformer inductance, and the efficiency of the WPT system decreases with the transmitting distance."
Linear Video Transformer Network,2021,"['Video Recognition', 'Video Classification', 'Action Recognition', 'Linear Transformers', 'Transformers', 'Visual Transformers', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Deep Learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper presents a video classification model built using linear complexity transformers. This method utilizes attention mechanism both in spatial and temporal domain but using efficient Transformers (namely the Linformer and Longformer) to lower complexity from quadratic to linear in both domains. By leveraging low rankness of self-attention (Linformer) and patterns of local attention within fixed window and some global attention (Longformer), we can lower quadratic complexity of full self-attention (in both temporal and spatial domain) to linear complexity, which saves us memory usage and training/inference time drastically. Transformer based models have shown in a literature comparable results and superior speed to 3D Convolution based models (namely I3D and SlowFast).  Experiments show the comparable results on Kinetics-400 dataset. By comparing pros and cons of Longformer and Linformer on temporal /spatial domain, we conclude which model has best accuracy and/or inference speed."
Zero-anaphora resolution in Korean based on deep language representation model: BERT,2021,"['attention', 'bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT)', 'deep learning', 'language representation model', 'zero-anaphora resolution (ZAR)']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"It is necessary to achieve high performance in the task of zero anaphora resolution (ZAR) for completely understanding the texts in Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and various other languages. Deep-learning-based models are being employed for building ZAR systems, owing to the success of deep learning in the recent years. However, the objective of building a high-quality ZAR system is far from being achieved even using these models. To enhance the current ZAR techniques, we fine-tuned a pretrained bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT). Notably, BERT is a general language representation model that enables systems to utilize deep bidirectional contextual information in a natural language text. It extensively exploits the attention mechanism based upon the sequence-transduction model Transformer. In our model, classification is simultaneously performed for all the words in the input word sequence to decide whether each word can be an antecedent. We seek end-to-end learning by disallowing any use of hand-crafted or dependency-parsing features. Experimental results show that compared with other models, our approach can significantly improve the performance of ZAR."
Model-free identification of multiple periodic excitations and detection of structural anomaly using noisy response measurements,2021,"['blind excitation separation', 'model-free and response-only approach', 'multiple periodic excitations', 'secondorder statistics', 'structural anomaly detection']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Anomaly and damage detection is an important research topic in the field of structural health monitoring (SHM). It is in general difficult to establish a precise computational model and measure multiple dynamic loads for complex structures. Model-free identification methods using only response measurements are therefore highly desired. Based on second-order statistics blind separation (SOSBS), this study explores response-only blind excitation separation and structural feature extraction when the structure is subject to multiple periodic excitations. The proposed method proceeds with two steps: (i) a transformation to convert the measurement space to eigenspace with identity covariance matrix and compact the measurement dimension to independent source dimension; and (ii) joint diagonalization of covariances with various time shifts to determine the mixture features. Neither structural model nor measurement of excitations is required in this method, and the extracted mixture matrix representative of structural dynamic characteristics can be used for structural anomaly detection and damage diagnosis. Both numerical simulation of a 3-degree-of-freedom vibration system and experimental study of a 5-story physical structure are conducted to verify the proposed method."

Manifestation of lattice topology data model for indoor navigation path based on the 3D building environment,2021,"['LTDM', 'lattice', 'spatial analysis', 'topology', 'indoor navigation path']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Navigation, also known as discovering one’s direction, is a complex human activity. To produce effective routes, it relies on knowledge of the surroundings’ precise geometry and semantic information. Complex geometrical data can be precisely delineated with the improvement of 3D geometric models. A precise 3D geometric model containing a specifically built-in Building Information Modelling (BIM) environment can be integrated into the Geographical Information System platform for indoor path generation to satisfy the requirements of indoor location-based services. Therefore, this paper proposes an approach to evaluate a 3D indoor topology network called a lattice topology data model (LTDM) for the floor-level paths in a 3D multipatch-based model. The LTDM requires the geometric information of the integrated BIM model to identify the indoor space and bounding lines for indoor network generation. The novelty of this study is in the application of the replacement of cell values into vector length for pathfinding through a combination of the Poincaré duality theorem and Dijkstra’s algorithm. The Campus Infrastructure Building model was chosen to validate the proposed method. Multiple space centroid pairs within the floor level were randomly selected to identify the shortest path using the LTDM principle. Paths drawn from the Medial Axis Transformation were compared with LTDM-generated paths for availability testing. The average floor-level path availability was 112% due to the generation of extra paths reflecting real-life situations. The LTDM paths were compared with on-site measurements for accuracy tests, and the average error rate was 3.18%. The results show that the implementation of the LTDM generates an excellent topology data network."
Magnetometer Calibration Based on the CHAOS-7 Model,2021,"['magnetometer', 'calibration', 'optimization', 'CHAOS-7', 'in-orbit', 'python']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"We describe a method for the in-orbit calibration of body-mounted magnetometers based on the CHAOS-7 geomagnetic field model. The code is designed to find the true calibration parameters autonomously by using only the onboard magnetometer data and the corresponding CHAOS outputs. As the model output and satellite data have different coordinate systems, they are first transformed to a Star Tracker Coordinate (STC). Then, non-linear optimization processes are run to minimize the differences between the CHAOS-7 model and satellite data in the STC. The process finally searches out a suite of calibration parameters that can maximize the model-data agreement. These parameters include the instrument gain, offset, axis orthogonality, and Euler rotation matrices between the magnetometer frame and the STC. To validate the performance of the Python code, we first produce pseudo satellite data by convoluting CHAOS-7 model outputs with a prescribed set of the 'true' calibration parameters. Then, we let the code autonomously undistort the pseudo satellite data through optimization processes, which ultimately track down the initially prescribed calibration parameters. The reconstructed parameters are in good agreement with the prescribed (true) ones, which demonstrates that the code can be used for actual instrument data calibration.

Aberrant gene expression in folliculogenesis can arrest the transition of preantral to antral follicles, leading to PCOS. We explored the possible role of altered gene expression in preantral follicles of estradiol valerate (EV) induced polycystic ovaries (PCO) in a mouse model.Methods: Twenty female balb/c mice (8 weeks, 20.0±1.5 g) were grouped into control and PCO groups. PCO was induced by intramuscular EV injection. After 8 weeks, the animals were killed by cervical dislocation. Blood serum (for hormonal assessments using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique) was aspirated, and ovaries (the right ovary for histological examinations and the left for quantitative real-time polymerase) were dissected. Results: Compared to the control group, the PCO group showed significantly lower values for the mean body weight, number of preantral and antral follicles, serum levels of estradiol, luteinizing hormone, testosterone, and follicle-stimulating hormone, and gene expression of TGFB1, GDF-9 and BMPR2 (p<0.05). Serum progesterone levels were significantly higher in the PCO animals than in the control group (p<0.05). No significant between-group differences (p>0.05) were found in BMP6 or BMP15 expression. Conclusions: In animals with EV-induced PCO, the preantral follicles did not develop into antral follicles. In this mouse model, the gene expression of TGFB1, GDF9, and BMPR2 was lower in preantral follicles, which is probably related to the pathologic conditions of PCO. Hypoandrogenism was also detected in this EV-induced murine PCO model."

The concatenation of a deep residual bidirectional gated recurrent neural network and logistic regression is used to learn the spatiotemporal correlation more robustly and predict the perceptual quality score. In addition, conditional video block-wise constraints are incorporated into the objective function to improve quality estimation performance for the entire video. The experimental results show that the proposed method extracts spatiotemporal motion information more effectively and predicts the video quality with higher accuracy than the conventional no-reference video quality assessment methods."
A study on the mechanism of resistance to non-small cell lung cancer therapeutic application using mouse orthotopic model,2021,"['Cancer', 'Animal model', 'TGF-β', 'NSCLC', 'Resistance']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"By contrast with the numerous genetic mechanisms of acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), the few mechanisms of resistance have been reported. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β is the pivotal cytokine to regulate the progression and metastasis of cancers. Canonical TGF-β signaling pathway is mediated through TGF-β-specific receptor-regulated SMADs: SMAD2 and SMAD3 and the common SMAD: SMAD4. Despite of the crucial roles of TGF-β signaling in NSCLC physiological features, little is known about the mechanisms SMAD-mediated TGF-β signaling regulates resistance in NSCLC. We examined lung adenocarcinoma cell lines: HCC827 harboring EGFRE746_A750del and mouse Ex3LLluc cells for the mechanistic investigation. We checked the tumor formation and chemoresistance according to expression and phosphorylation status of SMADs in vitro and in vivo. To examine the effects of phosphorylation of SMADs on chemo-responses in vitro and in vivo, it was generated constitutively inactive or active mutants using adeno-associated virus (AAV) system. We found that TGF-β signaling via SMAD3 enhanced the TKI-induced cell apoptosis of NSCLC. The expression and phosphorylation status of SMAD2 were changed according to chemo-responses of NSCLC. It regulated tumorigenesis and chemoresistance of NSCLC both in vitro and in vivo mouse models. In conclusion, SMAD2 phosphorylation status can be suggested that can be used as biomarkers to suppress TKI resistance."

Sometimes, the input data is too complicated for the models to learn useful patterns. Therefore, feature engineering is a crucial data preprocessing step for constructing a proper feature set to improve the performance of such models. One of the most efficient methods for automating feature engineering is the autoencoder, which transforms the data from its original space into a latent space. However certain factors, including the datasets, the machine learning models, and the number of dimensions of the latent space (denoted by k), should be carefully considered when using the autoencoder. In this study, we design a framework to compare two data preprocessing approaches: with and without autoencoder and to observe the impact of these factors on autoencoder. We then conduct experiments using autoencoders with classifiers on popular datasets. The empirical results provide a perspective regarding the best suited autoencoder for these factors."

In this study, we investigated the potential role of mirodenafil, a potent phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, in the treatment of fibrosis in SSc. We used a bleomycin (BLM)-induced SSc mouse model to mimic the typical features of fibrosis in human SSc and examined the dermal thickness to assess the degree of skin fibrosis after staining with hematoxylin and eosin or Masson’s trichrome stains. The effect of mirodenafil on the expression of profibrotic genes was also analyzed by treating fibroblasts with transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and mirodenafil. We showed that mirodenafil ameliorated dermal fibrosis and downregulated the protein levels of fibrosis markers including COL1A1 and α- SMA in the BLM-induced SSc mouse model. Further, using mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human lung fibroblasts, we demonstrated that the expression of collagen and profibrotic genes was reduced by treatment with mirodenafil. Finally, we showed that mirodenafil inhibited TGF-β- induced phosphorylation of Smad2/3 in fibroblasts, which suggested that this drug may ameliorate fibrosis by suppressing the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that mirodenafil possesses a therapeutic potential for treating fibrosis in SSc."

After comparison and analysis, one type of solid-state-transformer should be chosen to be widely applied and with integral functions for models and simulations. The IGBTs in solid-state-transformers vary in terms of fault condition and position, which influences the internal and external electrical parameters of systems. Therefore, it is proposed that collector-emitter voltage can be used to characterize the fault conditions of solid-state-transformers. Through simulation verification and waveform observations, it can be seen that the collector-emitter voltage and V<sub>M</sub>, which is the voltage of the primary side of the transformer in a solid-state-transformer, can be used to characterize the failure condition of the internal converter of the solid-state-transformer."
Seasonal performance of a non-hydrostatic global atmospheric model on a cubed-sphere grid,2021,"['Korean Integrated Model (KIM)', 'seasonal simulation', 'model comparison']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"A new operational weather forecast model, Korean Integrated Model (KIM), is evaluated on a seasonal simulation framework to extend its operations into prediction longer than the weather time scale. The simulated results are compare with those produced by the conventional spectral transform model using an identical physics package, in order to isolate the errors introduced by imperfect physics parameterizations. The simulated mean states of the KIM are very close to the reanalysis for the selected cases. Moreover, most large-scale fields from the KIM are comparable to those from the spectral transform model, which implies that the general features of large-scale variables and precipitation are highly governed by physical parameterizations, and that the physics – dynamics coupling in the KIM is stable in a long-term simulation. To understand the systematic biases of the KIM, the eddy transports on mean states, tropical large-scale circulations, and precipitation would be analyzed in detail."

At present, the pathogenesis of insomnia is not clear. Animal models can help us understand the pathogenesis of the disease and can be used in transformational medicine. Therefore, it is very necessary to establish an appropriate model of insomnia. Clinical data show that insomnia patients with high levels of thyroxine and often accompanied by cardiovascular problems, a common mechanism underlying all of these physiological disruptions is the sympathetic nervous system. Combined with the characteristics of chronic onset of clinical insomnia, an insomnia model induced by long-term intraperitoneal injection of thyroid hormone has been created in our laboratory. In this paper, the insomnia-like state of the model was evaluated based on three validity criteria. Face validity has been demonstrated in metabolism, the Morris water maze, electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG). Structure validity has been proved by the results of targeted metabolomics. After treatment with diazepam, a commonly used clinical anti-insomnia drug, the above physiological and pathological disorders were reversed. The results of comprehensive analysis show that the established thyrotoxicosis-associated insomnia model meets the validity requirement to establish an appropriate animal model of insomnia. The model presented in this article might help to study pathogenetic mechanisms of clinical insomnia, as well as to test promising methods of insomnia treatment."

This paper analyzes the new retail model of e-commerce, and discusses its differences with the traditional model of e-commerce. The goal of this research is to explore which model is more in line with the current trends by utilizing the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology. Experts working at top Chinese e-commerce companies were surveyed on four main criteria (technology, consumer, merchandise, and operation). By analyzing their responses, the reasoning behind why these four major criteria obtained their corresponding weights was studied. The results show that the customer is the most important factor among the four criteria, while technology seems to be less significant. Among the sub-criteria, the convenience of consumption is found to be the most important. The new retail model of e-commerce, which has started to flourish in China, is found to be more in line with current trends. This paper shows the reasons why the new retail model of e-commerce is important at a practical level, and provides a better understanding of its current status in China."

Many existing studies have revealed that compliance with the golden time in response to a disaster determines the success or failure of relief activities, and logistics costs account for 80% of the disaster response cost. Besides, the agility, responsiveness, and effectiveness of the humanitarian logistics system are emphasized in consideration of the disaster situation’s characteristics, such as the urgency of life-saving and rapid environmental changes. In other words, they emphasize the importance of logistics activities in disaster response, which includes the effective and efficient distribution of relief supplies. This study proposes a mathematical model for establishing a transport plan to distribute relief supplies in a disaster situation. To determine vehicles’ route and the amount of relief for cities suffering a disaster, it mainly considers the urgency, effectiveness (restoration rate), and uncertainty in the logistics system. The model is initially developed as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model containing some nonlinear functions and transform into a Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model using a logarithmic transformation and piecewise linear approximation method. Furthermore, a minimax problem is suggested to search for breakpoints and slopes to define a piecewise linear function that minimizes the linear approximation error. A numerical experiment is performed to verify the MILP model, and linear approximation error is also analyzed in the experiment."
Credit Risk Measurement Study of Commercial Banks Based on the Innovation Discrete Hopfield Neural Network Model,2021,"['commercial bank', 'credit risk', 'discrete hopfield neural network']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Purpose – Credit risk is always the major risk in the banking industry, and the main target of regulatory authorities. Based on modern financial theory and new credit instruments, modern risk measurement models have played a great role in the measurement of credit risk. However, most of these models assume normal distribution, which will lead to a deviation between the analysis results and the actual distribution of credit risk, c ause the “ thick tail” phenomenon, a nd reduce the accuracy of measurement results. In this context, the development of modern information technology makes it possible to introduce artificial intelligence technology into credit risk measurement, s uch as an artificial neural network, d ecision tree, g enetic programming, and support vector machine. Design/Methodology/Approach – Firstly, we use the commonly used an expert survey method and the research results and experience of previous scholars for reference to realize the transformation of regulatory indicators f rom qualitative t o quantitative. T hen, a c redit r isk measurement model based on t he Hopfield network was constructed in order to evaluate credit risk. Finally, the simulation experiment was carried out using real data from a commercial bank. Findings – The results show that a credit risk measurement model based on Hopfield neural network can accurately reflect the credit risk state of banking institutions. This shows that the credit risk measurement model proposed in this paper not only has the function of supporting decision-making for commercial bank managers, it is also an effective way for financial regulators to grasp the risk change trend in time. Research Implications – A credit risk measurement model of commercial banks based on a discrete Hopfield neural network is proposed. Because an artificial neural network has the advantages of strong “robustness”, high prediction accuracy, and is unstructured, this paper uses the associative memory function of DHNN to construct a credit risk measurement model based on a discrete Hopfield neural network. Simulation results show that the model can accurately reflect the credit risk status of banks."

Phase Transformation Modeling for Hypo Peritectic Steel in Continuous Cooling,2021,['Hypo peritectic steel · Modeling · Phase transformation · Continuous cooling'],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Phase change of steel during cooling affects the slab qualities in continuous casting. Especially, crack susceptibility of hypoperitectic steel is high because large volume shrinkage occurs by peritectic phase transformation during solidification andcooling. In continuous cooling, phase change is different from the behaviors under the equilibrium condition, such as undercoolingand extend of peritectic reaction, etc. Therefore, we develop a new phase change model considering thermodynamics,empirical equations, and carbon diffusion in each phase to predict phase change behavior during continuous cooling. Inthis model, phase change of hypo peritectic steel comprises 5 stages until all phases become the γ phase. The velocities ofthe δ/γ interface and phase fractions during cooling are calculated according to cooling rate, undercooling of the γ phase,and carbon contents. The results show that if solidification ends by the δ phase during dTp,the γ phase is formed by massivetransformation. On the contrary, if peritectic reaction starts with liquid, the γ phase is formed and grows by diffusionaltransformation. In latter case, massive transformation of remaining δ phase can occur with high undercooling or very fastcooling rates. This analysis shows that there are several different paths depending on carbon contents of hypo peritectic steels."

DPIM-Based InSAR Phase Unwrapping Model and a 3D Mining-Induced Surface Deformation Extracting Method: A Case of Huainan Mining Area,2021,"['D-InSAR', 'Phase unwrapping', 'Mining subsidence', 'LOS deformation', 'Three-dimensional deformation']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The mining subsidence in mining area could cause large-gradient deformation in a short period of time. When the deformation gradient exceeds the threshold value of the Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (D-InSAR) technology monitoring gradient, D-InSAR technology is likely to cause the failure of InSAR phase unwrapping algorithm. At this time, the InSAR technology is unable to monitor the 3D surface deformation. Aiming at these problems, an dynamic probability integral method (DPIM)-based InSAR phase unwrapping model and a method of extracting 3D surface deformation were proposed. The phase unwrapping model firstly used the empirical parameters of the probability integral of the mining face to predict the line of sight (LOS) direction deformation phase of the mining subsidence surface. Secondly, the phase of differential interferogram was unwrapped with the assist of the predicted LOS deformation phase under the constraint of DPIM, and the true LOS deformationphase was obtained, then the true LOS deformation phase transformed into LOS deformation. Finally, according to the geometric projection relationship between the LOS deformation and 3D deformation of mining subsidence surface, the probability integral prior model was brought into the equation of the geometric projection relationship. On the basis of relevant boundary conditions, the 3D surface deformation was extracted from the LOS direction deformation field of mining subsidence. The feasibility of the method was verified by the simulation experiment results. The differential interferogram of the subsidence basin was obtained by the differential interference processing of image data of Sentinel-1A on Nov. 16, 2017 and Dec. 10, 2017 of 1613 working face of Guqiao South Mine. By using the DPIM-based phase unwrapping model, the phase of differential interferogram was unwrapped and the 3D surface deformation during this period as well as the deformation extraction method were developed. The results showed that the maximum fitting error value of subsidence was 79 mm, about 8.33% of the maximum value of subsidence, and the fitting error of mean square of subsidence was ±33.5 mm. The results showed that the DPIM-based phase unwrapping model and the method of extracting 3D surface deformation proposed in this paper have certain engineering application values."

Adversarial attacks crafted perturbations that create the optical illusion. It forces the model to misclassify the samples and mistake to accomplish the desired task. For that reason, it is crucial to apply defense solutions that increase the robustness of adversarial networks against adversarial attacks. To overcome this issue, a defense solution introduce by adopting the instance sparsity mapping network.

Topology and start-up strategy for DC-DC transformers based on voltage balancing unit,2021,"['DC distribution network', 'Input series output parallel (ISOP)', 'DC solid-state transformer (DCSST)', 'Voltage balancing unit (VBU)', 'Start-up strategy']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"As a core piece of equipment in DC distribution networks, DC solid-state transformers (DCSSTs) are attracting more and more attention in academia and industry. Due to the limitations in terms of the electrical stress of the switches, the input series output parallel (ISOP) structure is adopted in DCSSTs. This paper proposed an improved DCSST topology based on a voltage balancing unit (VBU). This topology has the advantages of higher power density, reduced weight, and cascaded number without compromising efficiency, cost, or reliability. The working modes, mathematical models, and control strategy are analyzed. In addition, a start-up strategy and a parameter design method are proposed in this paper. Simulation and experimental results verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed solution. The proposed DCSST is a practical scheme for the application of DC distribution networks."
Weighted rank estimation for nonparametric transformation models with doubly truncated data,2021,"['Covariate-dependent truncation', 'Iterative marginal optimization', 'Log-concave error density', 'Maximum rank correlation', 'U statistic']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Doubly truncated data often arise when event times are observed only if they fall within subject-specifc intervals. We analyze doubly truncated data using nonparametric transformation models, where an unknown monotonically increasing transformation of the response variable is equal to an unknown monotonically increasing function of a linear combination of the covariates plus a random error with an unspecifed log-concave probability density function. Furthermore, we assume that the truncation variables are conditionally independent of the response variable given the covariates and leave the conditional distributions of truncation variables given the covariates unspecifed. For estimation of regression parameters, we propose a weighted rank (WR) estimation procedure and establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the resulting estimator. The limiting covariance matrix of the WR estimator can be estimated by a resampling technique, which does not involve nonparametric density estimation or numerical derivatives. A numerical study is conducted and suggests that the proposed methodology works well in practice, and an illustration based on real data is provided."

Protective effect of Gyeji-tang in a mouse model of cigarette smoke and lipopolysaccharide-induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,2021,"['Gyeji-tang', 'Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease', 'Inflammatory disease', 'Cigarette smoke']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an inflammatory lung disorder that is characterized by persistent airflow limitation and associated with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and sputum production. Gyeji-tang (GJT) is composed of five oriental herb and widely used as a traditional Asian medicine. In this study, we examined the protective effect of GJT in a mouse model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) induced by cigarette smoke (CS) combined with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Mice received CS exposure daily for 8 weeks and intranasal instillation of LPS on weeks 1, 3, 5 and 7. GJT (100 and 200 mg/kg) was administrated daily 1 hour before CS treatment for the last 4 weeks. Roflumilast (10 mg/kg) as a positive control was used in this study. In histopathological evaluation, bronchoalveolar structural damage with inflammations were significantly suppressed in GJT treated animals. Administration of GJT significantly suppressed influx of total inflammatory cells, especially macrophages in BALF induced by CS with LPS exposure. Relative expression of TNF-α, IL-6, L-1β and IL-8 were significantly inhibited in lung tissues by treatment of GJT. GJT prevented activation of NF-κB and STAT3 induced by CS and LPS. Furthermore, GJT treatment decreased the expression of structural remodeling markers including transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)-7 and MMP-9. Present study results demonstrates that GJT prevents lung inflammation and airway remodeling induced by CS with LPS exposure via NF-κB and STAT3 pathway. Therefore, GJT may be potential therapy for the treatment of COPD."
A Study on the Development of Product Planning Prediction Model Using Logistic Regression Algorithm,2021,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"This study was conducted to propose a product planning prediction model using logistic regression algorithm to predict seasonal factors and rapidly changing product trends.

Effects of Jakyakgamcho-tang on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in a mouse model induced by cigarette smoke and lipopolysaccharide,2021,"['Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease', 'Cigarette smoke', 'Jakyakgamcho-tang', 'Inflammation', 'Emphysema']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disorder that is characterized by neutrophilic airway inflammation, airway remodeling and pulmonary emphysema. Jakyakgamcho-tang (JGT), an herbal prescription consisting of Paeonia lactiflora Pallas and Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fischer, has been used in traditional Eastern medicine to treat gynecological diseases, arthritic diseases, and muscular diseases. Previous studies also have demonstrated the various therapeutic properties of JGT, including its analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic and anti-allergic effects. However, there is no study that has examined the effectiveness of JGT on COPD. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of JGT against COPD using a mouse model of cigarette smoke (CS) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced COPD. COPD was induced by exposing to CS for 1 h per day for 8 weeks and intranasally received LPS on week 1, 3, 5 and 7. JGT was administered to mice by oral gavage at a dose of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg 1 h before CS exposure for last 4 weeks. Compared with CS plus LPS-exposed mice, mice in the JGT-treated group showed significantly decreased inflammatory cells count and reduced interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP- 1) levels in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue. JGT also suppressed the phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 MAPK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) caused by CS plus LPS exposure. Furthermore, CS plus LPS induced increases in transforming growth factor (TGF)- β, α-smooth muscle actin (SMA), matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 were inhibited in JGT-treated mice. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that JGT prevents respiratory inflammation and airway remodeling caused by CS with LPS exposure."
Protective effect of Panicum dichotomiflorum in a rat model of testosterone-induced benign prostatic hyperplasia,2021,"['Panicum dichotomiflorum', 'Benign prostatic hyperplasia', 'Growth factor', 'Apoptosis', 'Inflammation']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a non-malignant enlargement of the prostate gland, resulted from hyperplastic changes of prostate epithelial and stromal cells and it can be lead to lower urinary tract symptoms. Panicum dichotomiflorum (PD) is an annual grass distributing throughout the world. This study was aimed to evaluate the protective effect of PD extract on benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in a rat model of testosterone-induced BPH. BPH of rat was induced by daily subcutaneous (s.c) administration of testosterone propionate (TP) 3 mg/kg for four weeks. Simultaneously, rats were also administered daily oral gavage of PD (150 mg/kg), finasteride (10 mg/kg) as a positive control or vehicle. After final treatment, all animals were sacrificed humanely and prostates of each animal were isolated, weighed and collected for further analysis. Administration of PD to testosterone-induced BPH rats notably reduced relative prostate weight and concentrations of prostatic dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and serum testosterone. Epithelial thickness and expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and cyclin D1 were markedly suppressed by PD treatment. In addition, protein expressions of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and cleaved caspase-3 were reduced PD-treated rats. PD decreased the levels of growth factors including transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and protein expression of phospho-Akt. Further investigation showed that PD suppressed testosterone-induced prostatic inflammation and inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8. Taken together, PD protects from BPH progression by enhancing apoptosis and inhibiting growth factor signaling and inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that PD has potential to protect from BPH progression accompanied by inflammation."

Personality Prediction Based on Text Analytics Using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers from English Twitter Dataset,2021,"['Personality prediction', 'Twitter', 'Big Five personality traits', 'BERT']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Personality traits can be inferred from a person’s behavioral patterns. One example is when writing posts on social media. Extracting information about individual personalities can yield enormous benefits for various applications such as recommendation systems, marketing, or hiring employees. The objective of this research is to build a personality prediction system that uses English texts from Twitter as a dataset to predict personality traits. This research uses the Big Five personality traits theory to analyze personality traits, which consist of openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Several classifiers were used in this research, such as support vector machine, convolutional neural network, and variants of bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT). To improve the performance, we implemented several feature extraction techniques, such as N-gram, linguistic inquiry and word count (LIWC), word embedding, and data augmentation. The best results were obtained by fine-tuning the BERT model and using it as the main classifier of the personality prediction system. We conclude that the BERT performance could be improved by using individual tweets instead of concatenated ones."
Catalytic hydrocracking reactions of tetralin as aromatic biomass tar model compound to benzene/toluene/xylenes (BTX) over zeolites under ambient pressure conditions,2021,"['Poly-aromatics', 'BTX mixtures', 'Cracking', 'Zeolite catalysts', 'Pyrolysis', 'Mechanism']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The gas phase selective hydrocracking process of tetralin (biomass tar model chemical compound) intobenzene, toluene and xylenes (BTX) was carried out over the H-Beta, H-Mordenite, H-USY, H-Y, and HZSM-5 zeolite catalysts in a packed bed reactor under applied atmospheric pressure. To the best of ourscientific knowledge, this performed work presents thefirst systematic investigation, focused on tetralin,cracking to BTX under ambient 1 bar. The highest catalytic activity and carbon deposition resistance wereestablished over the H-ZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 = 30) with the selectivity to the BTX of 52.2 mol.% inintermediates’ liquid phase, 88.7 mol.% of total conversion yield after the 4 h time on stream, 370 C andgas hourly space velocity (GHSV) = 530 h–1, and limited site deactivation. The gas phase was analyzed andethylene, propane, ethane and methane were identified as main gas products in the product mixture atdifferent reaction conditions. All catalysts were characterized by BET, ICP-AES, XRD, HRSEM, NH3-TPD,and pyridine-DRIFT technique. This high catalytic performance of the H-ZSM-5 catalyst is attributed tothe presence the high mesopore volume and mesopore surface area, the mild acidity and the highestBrönsted to Lewis acid sites ratio (BAS/LAS) comparing with other studied zeolite catalysts. Based on theexperimental results, the reaction pathway of tetralin transformation into BTX was proposed.Hydrocracking, ring opening, ring contraction, dehydrogenation/hydrogenation, alkylation/dealkylation,isomerization, and overcracking reactions were involved. Results were consistent with the occurrence ofthe monomolecular reaction mechanism."
