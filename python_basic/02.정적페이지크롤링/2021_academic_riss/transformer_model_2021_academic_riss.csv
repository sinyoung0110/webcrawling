FEM Simulation and Test Verification of PD Ultrasonic Signal Propagation in a Power Transformer Model,2021,"['Power transformers', 'Partial discharge', 'FEM', 'Propagation property']",,"Ultrasonic signals will be generated when partial discharge occurs in internal insulation faults in large oil immersed power transformers: because the ultrasonic signal has strong anti-interference ability and has no direct electromagnetic contact with the equipment, it is widely used in transformer fault detection and positioning. In this paper, the fi nite element method (FEM) is used to simulate the ultrasonic signal in a 35 kV power transformer. The infl uence of transformer case on ultrasonic signal propagation is considered, and the propagation law of the ultrasonic signal inside the transformer is obtained. Fabry–Pérot (F–P) fi bre acoustic sensors with a centre frequency of 28 kHz were fabricated. A partial discharge detection test was carried out in a 35 kV transformer winding model using the F–P sensors. The test results show that the ultrasonic waveform detected by the F–P sensors are in good agreement with the simulation results, and the propagation of the ultrasonic wave inside the transformer is verifi ed. It lays a foundation for detecting and locating PDs in power transformer by F–P acoustic sensors."
Analytical loss model of series-resonant indirect-matrix-type power electronics transformers using MOSFETs,2021,"['Analytical loss model', 'MOSFET', 'Series-resonant dc-dc converter', 'Indirect-matrix converter', 'Power electronics transformer', 'High efficiency']",,"A MOSFET-based series-resonant indirect-matrix-type power electronic transformer (PET) consists of line-frequency-switching folding-unfolding bridges and series-resonant dc-dc converters (SRCs), which is an attractive choice to achieve ac-ac conversion due to its high efficiency and high power density. However, the conduction losses, switching losses, and core losses in each of the high-frequency switching cycles T<sub>s</sub> are different due to the pulsating dc voltage |ac|, which introduces difficulties in the calculation of losses. In addition, the small dc capacitors also participate in the resonance, and the resonant current shape deviates from a pure sine. Therefore, the conventional loss model is not suitable for PETs. In this paper, the time-domain analysis of SRC resonant current considering the dc capacitor is developed. Then, the analytical expression of the resonant current RMS value in grid cycle T<sub>g</sub> is derived, which is more accurate in calculating conduction loss than the conventional model. In addition, it avoids the calculating losses in each T<sub>s</sub>. Next, an analytical switching loss model is developed based on the curve fitting of the capacitance-voltage relationship. A simplified analytical core loss model is provided. Each part of the loss of the PET is verified by thermal simulations, and the total losses are verified by efficiency tests on an experiment prototype."

Novel fuzzy direct torque control based on constructed functional transformed grey model,2021,"['Grey prediction', 'GM(1', '1) model', 'Fuzzy control', 'Direct torque control', 'Functional transformation', 'Equal dimensional new information']",,"To reduce the ripple of the magnetic flux and torque of motors and the reduce the hysteresis in motor speed control, an improved grey model predictive fuzzy direct torque control (DTC) method based on function transformation is proposed. First, a function transformation is used to transform the sampled sequences to nonnegative values. This overcomes the disadvantages caused by fluctuant and random sampling of the motor torque and stator flux linkage. Second, an equal dimensional new information model is used to keep the dimensions unchanged, which reduces the time to predict the motor parameters through the model. Moreover, the voltage space vector plane is divided into six sectors, which simplifies the fuzzy control system rules. Simulation results show that the proposed fuzzy direct torque control based on the improved grey model method reduces the influence of hysteresis on the control system, decreases the motor flux chain and torque ripple, improves the response speed of the torque and rotational speed, reduces overshoot, achieves good effects in terms of anti-interference capability and dynamic response, and improves the real-time performance and accuracy of the fuzzy control system."
Design and Modeling of Octagonal Planar Inductor and Transformer in Monolithic Technology for RF Systems,2021,['Forward converter  · Inductor  · Integration  · Octagonal  · Planar  · RF  · Transformer'],,"This paper presents the design and modeling of planar inductor and transformer for their integration in a Forward converter.The windings are of octagonal spiral planar topology. Basing on Wheeler method, we evaluate the inductance values of planar coils. All parasitic eff ects generated by stacking of diff erent material layers are summarized perfectly in the π-electrical model of both on chip inductor and transformer. The electromagnetic simulation, by using COMSOL Multiphysics 5.3 software, illustrates the distribution of magnetic fi eld lines, the current density and the temperature distribution in our integrated micro coils. To validate the diff erent geometric and electrical parameters values, we have simulated the circuit of the Forward converter containing the π-electrical circuit of on chip integrated inductor and transformer, using the software TINA 9.0."
Transforming growth factor-beta and liver injury in an arginine vasopressin-induced pregnant rat model,2021,"['Arginase 1', 'Arginine vasopressin', 'Aspartate transaminase 1', 'Liver injury', 'Transforming growth factor beta']",,"Objective: Approximately 30% of preeclamptic pregnancies exhibit abnormal liver function tests. We assessed liver injury-associated enzyme levels and circulating transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) levels in an arginine vasopressin (AVP)-induced pregnant Sprague-Dawley rat model.Methods: Pregnant and non-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats (n=24) received AVP (150 ng/hr) subcutaneously via mini-osmotic pumps for 18 days. Blood pressure was measured, urine samples were collected, and all animals were euthanized via isoflurane. Blood was collected to measure circulating levels of TGF-β1-3 isomers and liver injury enzymes in pregnant AVP (PAVP), pregnant saline (PS), non-pregnant AVP (NAVP), and non-pregnant saline (NS) rats. Results: The PAVP group showed significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure than both saline-treated groups. The weight per pup was significantly lower in the AVP-treated group than in the saline group (p<0.05). Circulating TGF-β1-3 isomer levels were significantly higher in the PAVP rats than in the NS rats. However, similar TGF-1 and TGF-3 levels were noted in the PS and PAVP rats, while TGF-2 levels were significantly higher in the PAVP rats. Circulating liver-type arginase-1 and 5'-nucleotidase levels were higher in the PAVP rats than in the saline group. Conclusion: This is the first study to demonstrate higher levels of TGF-β2, arginase, and 5'-nucleotidase activity in PAVP than in PS rats. AVP may cause vasoconstriction and increase peripheral resistance and blood pressure, thereby elevating TGF-β and inducing the preeclampsia-associated inflammatory response. Future studies should explore the mechanisms through which AVP dysregulates liver injury enzymes and TGF-β in pregnant rats."
REDUCED DIFFERENTIAL TRANSFORM FOR THERMAL STRESS ANALYSIS UNDER 2-D HYPERBOLIC HEAT CONDUCTION MODEL WITH LASER HEAT SOURCE,2021,"['Hyperbolic heat conduction', 'Thermal stresses', 'Thermal displacement', 'Stress function', 'Laser pulse', 'Reduced differential transform method']",,"In this study, a two-dimensional thermoelastic problem under hyperbolic heat conduction theory with an internal heat source is considered. The general solution for the temperature field, stress components and displacement field are obtained using the reduced differential transform method. The stress and displacement components are obtained using the thermal stress function in the reduced differential transform domain. All the solutions are obtained in the form of power series. The special case with a time-dependent laser heat source has been considered. The problem is considered for homogeneous material with finite rectangular cross-section heated with a non-Gaussian temporal profile. The effect of the heat source on all the characteristics of a material is discussed numerically and graphically for magnesium material taking a pulse duration of 0.2 ps. This study provides a powerful tool for finding the solution to the thermoelastic problem with less computational work as compared to other methods. The result obtained in the study may be useful for the investigation of thermal characteristics in engineering and industrial applications."
Application of transform software for downscaling global climate model EdGCM results in north-eastern Bangladesh,2021,"['Climate', 'Downscaling', 'EdGCM', 'Mann-Kendall Trend test', 'NSE', 'Surface air temperature']",,"Downscaling is a state-of-the-art technique to generate fine-resolution climate change prediction and an obvious tool for forecasting future climate scenarios for many data-scarce areas like Bangladesh. The Educational Global Climate Model (EdGCM) predicts numerically and its performance was not evaluated for Bangladesh earlier. Due to this reason, an attempt has been made to apply a new geostatistical approach with the help of transform software to downscale EdGCM for identifying the trend of surface air temperature at the Sylhet district. Both Doubled_CO₂ and Global_Warming_01 are simulated from EdGCM and maps are generated to depict global temperature variations. Downscaling is applied to the outputs from Doubled_CO₂ scenario. Percent of bias (PBIAS), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and the ratio of root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data (RSR) values are satisfactory and acceptable. The trend analysis was performed using the Mann-Kendall Trend test and Sen’s slope estimator. Temperature changes are significant for both downscaled and observed results of p-value which is less than alpha = 0.05. Mann-Kendall Z tests for annual downscaled and IPCC during (2006-2020) show a positive trend. Downscaled predicted annual average temperature (simulations by Doubled_CO₂) for 2020 is 21.67˚C for the Sylhet district."

Empirical Analysis of a Fine-Tuned Deep Convolutional Model in Classifying and Detecting Malaria Parasites from Blood Smears,2021,"['Malaria', 'Convolutional Neural Networks', 'Deep Learning', 'Fine-Tuning', 'Transfer Learning']",,"In this work, we empirically evaluated the efficiency of the recent EfficientNetB0 model to identify and diagnose malaria parasite infections in blood smears. The dataset used was collected and classified by relevant experts from the Lister Hill National Centre for Biomedical Communications (LHNCBC). We prepared our samples with minimal image transformations as opposed to others, as we focused more on the feature extraction capability of the EfficientNetB0 baseline model. We applied transfer learning to increase the initial feature sets and reduced the training time to train our model. We then fine-tuned it to work with our proposed layers and re-trained the entire model to learn from our prepared dataset. The highest overall accuracy attained from our evaluated results was 94.70% from fifty epochs and followed by 94.68% within just ten. Additional visualization and analysis using the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) algorithm visualized how effectively our fine-tuned EfficientNetB0 detected infections better than other recent state-of-the-art DCNN models. This study, therefore, concludes that when fine-tuned, the recent EfficientNetB0 will generate highly accurate deep learning solutions for the identification of malaria parasites in blood smears without the need for stringent pre-processing, optimization, or data augmentation of images."
Effects of Particulate Matter 10 Inhalation on Lung Tissue RNA expression in a Murine Model,2021,"['Particulate Matter', 'RNA Sequencing', 'Lung']",,"Background: Particulate matter 10 (PM<sub>10</sub>; airborne particles <10 μm) inhalation has been demonstrated to induce airway and lung diseases. In this study, we investigate the effects of PM<sub>10</sub> inhalation on RNA expression in lung tissues using a murine model.Methods: Female BALB/c mice were affected with PM<sub>10</sub>, ovalbumin (OVA), or both OVA and PM<sub>10</sub>. PM<sub>10</sub> was administered intranasally while OVA was both intraperitoneally injected and intranasally administered. Treatments occurred 4 times over a 2-week period. Two days after the final challenges, mice were sacrificed. Full RNA sequencing using lung homogenates was conducted.Results: While PM<sub>10</sub> did not induce cell proliferation in bronchoalveolar fluid or lead to airway hyper-responsiveness, it did cause airway inflammation and lung fibrosis. Levels of interleukin 1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and transforming growth factor-β in lung homogenates were significantly elevated in the PM<sub>10</sub>-treated group, compared to the control group. The PM<sub>10</sub> group also showed increased RNA expression of Rn45a , Snord22 , Atp6v0c-ps2 , Snora28 , Snord15b , Snora70 , and Mmp12 . Generally, genes associated with RNA splicing, DNA repair, the inflammatory response, the immune response, cell death, and apoptotic processes were highly expressed in the PM<sub>10</sub>-treated group. The OVA/PM<sub>10</sub> treatment did not produce greater effects than OVA alone. However, the OVA/PM<sub>10</sub>-treated group did show increased RNA expression of Clca1, Snord22, Retnla, Prg2, Tff2, Atp6v0c-ps2, and Fcgbp when compared to the control groups. These genes are associated with RNA splicing, DNA repair, the inflammatory response, and the immune response.Conclusion: Inhalation of PM<sub>10</sub> extensively altered RNA expression while also inducing cellular inflammation, fibrosis, and increased inflammatory cytokines in this murine mouse model."
Yarrow oil ameliorates ulcerative colitis in mice model via regulating the NF-κB and PPAR-γ pathways,2021,"['Achillea millefolium', 'Asteraceae', 'Inflammatory bowel diseases', 'NF-kappa B', 'PPAR gamma']",,"Background/Aims: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder with indefinite etiology; however, environmen-tal, genetic, immune factors and microbial agents could be implicated in its pathogenesis. UC treatment is lifelong, therefore; the potential side effects and cost of the therapy are significant. Yarrow is a promising medicinal plant with the ability to treat many disorders, owing to its bioactive compounds especially the essential oil. The main aim of this research was to investigate the therapeutic effect of the yarrow oil on colitis including the involved mechanism of action. Methods: In 21-female C57BL/6 mice were divided into 3 groups; control group, colitis model group, and oil-treated group. Groups 2 and 3 received 5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for 9 days, and concomitantly, only group 3 was given 100 mg/kg yarrow oil. Mice were examined for their body weight, stool consistency and bleeding, and the disease activity indexes were calculated. Results: Oral administration of yarrow oil markedly repressed the severity of UC via the reduction of the inflammatory signs and restoring colon length. The oil was able to down-regulate nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), up-regulate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), and enhance transforming growth factor-β expression. The oil normalized the tumor necrosis factor-α expression, restored the normal serum level of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and reduced the serum level of IL-6. Conclusions: Yarrow oil mitigated UC symptoms and regulated the inflammatory cytokines secretion via regulation of NF-κB and PPAR-γ pathways in the mice model, however, this recommendation requires further investigations using clinical studies to confirm the use of the oil on humans.

In vivo therapeutic success of microRNA-155 antagomir in a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin,2021,"['Pulmonary fibrosis', 'MicroRNA-155', 'Antagomir', 'Bleomycin']",,"Background/Aims: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical regulatory roles in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. The aim of this study was to explore whether miRNA antagomirs could serve as potential therapeutic agents in interstitial lung diseases.Methods: A mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis was established by intratracheal injection of bleomycin (BLM). Using microarray analysis, up-regulated miRNAs were identified during the development of pulmonary fibrosis. miR-155 was chosen as the candidate miRNA. Fifteen mice were then randomized into the following three groups: BLM + antagomiR-155 group, treated with BLM plus intravenously injected with antagomiR-155; BLM group, treated with intratracheal BLM plus phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); and a control group, treated with PBS only. Lung tissues were collected for histopathological analysis, hydroxyproline measurement, and Western blotting. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used for the measurement of cytokines associated with pulmonary fibrosis.Results: Histological changes and hydroxyproline levels induced by BLM were significantly inhibited by antagomiR-155. The levels of interleukin 4 (IL-4) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) expression were increased after BLM treatment. However, miR-155 silencing decreased the expression of IL-4, TGF-β, and interferon-γ. TGF-β-activated kinase 1/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 7 (MAP3K7)-binding protein 2 (TAB2) of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, was activated by BLM and inhibited by in vivo silencing of miR-155 via antagomiR-155.Conclusions: In vivo treatment with antagomiR-155 alleviated the pathological changes induced by BLM and may be a promising therapeutic strategy for pulmonary fibrosis."

As a result, various attempts have been made to automatically summarize a large amount of text. In particular, the abstractive summarization approach is being actively studied because it can create a new summary with rich contextual expressions. In the abstractive summarization task, neural network-based transformer models show high-performance and are used widely. However, if a sufficient amount of training data is not provided, it is difficult to generate a high-quality summary because the parameters constituting the transformer are not sufficiently learned. In this work, we proposes a text summarization method that generates a high-quality summary given a small amount of training data. Specifically, we extract some elements of KoBERT and apply them to a transformer-based abstractive summarization model. We conducted an experiment on 42,803 cases of Dacon's summary data to evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology. As a result of the experiment, it was confirmed that the proposed methodology showed superior performance based on the ROUGE index compared to the comparative method."

These instructions give you guidelines for preparing papers for JDCS. The method of generating Adversarial examples for text data of the transformer model was mostly a black box attack method because of the discrete characteristics of text data. Recently, a gradient-based white box attack method targeting text data of a transformer model has been announced, which has the disadvantage that it takes a long time and is not efficient because it learns one distribution for each generation of an example. This paper improves the efficiency of the existing white box attack method by proposing an attention constraint using the attention structure of the transformer model. Through experiments, it has been proven that the generation time can be shortened by about 6.5% and the diversity of generated adversarial examples can be increased by 2.4% compared to the previous research results."
Transmission Distance Improvement of a Two-Coil Magnetic Resonance Wireless Power Transmission System Using Transformers,2021,"['Magnetic Resonance Modeling', 'Q-Factor', 'Wireless Power Transfer']",,"In this paper, a two-coil magnetic resonance wireless transmission system is studied to improve the transmission distance using transformers. A conventional two-coil and four-coil wireless power transmission (WPT) system as well as a two-coil WPT system with transformers are analyzed comparatively via circuit simulations and experiments. Circuit analysis was used to predict the transmission distance with the highest efficiency. To verify the improvement in the transmission distance of the proposed system, transformers with inductance values of 80, 100, and 140 μH were fabricated and analyzed through experiments and simulations. A maximum S21 parameter of 0.76 was noted when the inductance was 80 μH and the transmitting distance was 4 cm. The experimental results almost matched the simulation results. From the experiments, it was shown that the transmitting distance of a WPT system can be adjusted by using transformers. Additionally, it was found that the transmitting distance is inversely proportional to the transformer inductance, and the efficiency of the WPT system decreases with the transmitting distance."
Zero-anaphora resolution in Korean based on deep language representation model: BERT,2021,"['attention', 'bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT)', 'deep learning', 'language representation model', 'zero-anaphora resolution (ZAR)']",,"It is necessary to achieve high performance in the task of zero anaphora resolution (ZAR) for completely understanding the texts in Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and various other languages. Deep-learning-based models are being employed for building ZAR systems, owing to the success of deep learning in the recent years. However, the objective of building a high-quality ZAR system is far from being achieved even using these models. To enhance the current ZAR techniques, we fine-tuned a pretrained bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT). Notably, BERT is a general language representation model that enables systems to utilize deep bidirectional contextual information in a natural language text. It extensively exploits the attention mechanism based upon the sequence-transduction model Transformer. In our model, classification is simultaneously performed for all the words in the input word sequence to decide whether each word can be an antecedent. We seek end-to-end learning by disallowing any use of hand-crafted or dependency-parsing features. Experimental results show that compared with other models, our approach can significantly improve the performance of ZAR."

However, existing regulations such as IP blacklist and slang filters make it difficult to detect malicious comments. Therefore, we need an artificial intelligence model optimized for unethical sentence detection. This paper proposes a Transformer-based unethical sentence detection model that has shown high performance in natural language processing. The model showed accuracy of 95.03% and will be utilized as an unethical sentence detection model. Also, it will be applied in various fields such as streaming services as well as comments on SNS."
Manifestation of lattice topology data model for indoor navigation path based on the 3D building environment,2021,"['LTDM', 'lattice', 'spatial analysis', 'topology', 'indoor navigation path']",,"Navigation, also known as discovering one’s direction, is a complex human activity. To produce effective routes, it relies on knowledge of the surroundings’ precise geometry and semantic information. Complex geometrical data can be precisely delineated with the improvement of 3D geometric models. A precise 3D geometric model containing a specifically built-in Building Information Modelling (BIM) environment can be integrated into the Geographical Information System platform for indoor path generation to satisfy the requirements of indoor location-based services. Therefore, this paper proposes an approach to evaluate a 3D indoor topology network called a lattice topology data model (LTDM) for the floor-level paths in a 3D multipatch-based model. The LTDM requires the geometric information of the integrated BIM model to identify the indoor space and bounding lines for indoor network generation. The novelty of this study is in the application of the replacement of cell values into vector length for pathfinding through a combination of the Poincaré duality theorem and Dijkstra’s algorithm. The Campus Infrastructure Building model was chosen to validate the proposed method. Multiple space centroid pairs within the floor level were randomly selected to identify the shortest path using the LTDM principle. Paths drawn from the Medial Axis Transformation were compared with LTDM-generated paths for availability testing. The average floor-level path availability was 112% due to the generation of extra paths reflecting real-life situations. The LTDM paths were compared with on-site measurements for accuracy tests, and the average error rate was 3.18%. The results show that the implementation of the LTDM generates an excellent topology data network."
Magnetometer Calibration Based on the CHAOS-7 Model,2021,"['magnetometer', 'calibration', 'optimization', 'CHAOS-7', 'in-orbit', 'python']",,"We describe a method for the in-orbit calibration of body-mounted magnetometers based on the CHAOS-7 geomagnetic field model. The code is designed to find the true calibration parameters autonomously by using only the onboard magnetometer data and the corresponding CHAOS outputs. As the model output and satellite data have different coordinate systems, they are first transformed to a Star Tracker Coordinate (STC). Then, non-linear optimization processes are run to minimize the differences between the CHAOS-7 model and satellite data in the STC. The process finally searches out a suite of calibration parameters that can maximize the model-data agreement. These parameters include the instrument gain, offset, axis orthogonality, and Euler rotation matrices between the magnetometer frame and the STC. To validate the performance of the Python code, we first produce pseudo satellite data by convoluting CHAOS-7 model outputs with a prescribed set of the 'true' calibration parameters. Then, we let the code autonomously undistort the pseudo satellite data through optimization processes, which ultimately track down the initially prescribed calibration parameters. The reconstructed parameters are in good agreement with the prescribed (true) ones, which demonstrates that the code can be used for actual instrument data calibration. This study is performed using Python 3.8.5, NumPy 1.19.2, SciPy 1.6, AstroPy 4.2, SpacePy 0.2.1, and ChaosmagPy 0.5 including the CHAOS-7.6 geomagnetic field model. This code will be utilized for processing NextSat-1 and Small scale magNetospheric and Ionospheric Plasma Experiment (SNIPE) data in the future."
"Alteration of TGFB1, GDF9, and BMPR2 gene expression in preantral follicles of an estradiol valerate-induced polycystic ovary mouse model can lead to anovulation, polycystic morphology, obesity, and absence of hyperandrogenism",2021,"['Bone morphogenetic protein 6', 'Bone morphogenetic protein 15', 'Bone morphogenetic protein receptor II', 'Folliculogenesis', 'Growth differentiation factor 9', 'Multicystic morphology of ovary', 'Polycystic ovary syndrome', 'Transforming growth factor-β1']",,"Objective: In humans, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an androgen-dependent ovarian disorder. Aberrant gene expression in folliculogenesis can arrest the transition of preantral to antral follicles, leading to PCOS. We explored the possible role of altered gene expression in preantral follicles of estradiol valerate (EV) induced polycystic ovaries (PCO) in a mouse model.Methods: Twenty female balb/c mice (8 weeks, 20.0±1.5 g) were grouped into control and PCO groups. PCO was induced by intramuscular EV injection. After 8 weeks, the animals were killed by cervical dislocation. Blood serum (for hormonal assessments using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique) was aspirated, and ovaries (the right ovary for histological examinations and the left for quantitative real-time polymerase) were dissected. Results: Compared to the control group, the PCO group showed significantly lower values for the mean body weight, number of preantral and antral follicles, serum levels of estradiol, luteinizing hormone, testosterone, and follicle-stimulating hormone, and gene expression of TGFB1, GDF-9 and BMPR2 (p<0.05). Serum progesterone levels were significantly higher in the PCO animals than in the control group (p<0.05). No significant between-group differences (p>0.05) were found in BMP6 or BMP15 expression. Conclusions: In animals with EV-induced PCO, the preantral follicles did not develop into antral follicles. In this mouse model, the gene expression of TGFB1, GDF9, and BMPR2 was lower in preantral follicles, which is probably related to the pathologic conditions of PCO. Hypoandrogenism was also detected in this EV-induced murine PCO model."

Using the Laplace-Fourier integral transforms to get the solutions of the problem analytically, the basic formulations of the two-dimension problem are given by matrices-vectors differential forms, which are then solved by the eigenvalues scheme. Numerical techniques are used for the inversion processes of the Laplace- Fourier transform. The results for physical quantities are represented graphically. The numerical outcomes show that the characteristic time of pulse heat flux have great impacts on the studied fields values."
No-reference quality assessment of dynamic sports videos based on a spatiotemporal motion model,2021,"['3D shearlet transform', 'conditional constraints', 'deep residual bidirectional gated recurrent neural network', 'natural scene statistics', 'no-reference video quality assessment']",,"This paper proposes an approach to improve the performance of no-reference video quality assessment for sports videos with dynamic motion scenes using an efficient spatiotemporal model. In the proposed method, we divide the video sequences into video blocks and apply a 3D shearlet transform that can efficiently extract primary spatiotemporal features to capture dynamic natural motion scene statistics from the incoming video blocks. The concatenation of a deep residual bidirectional gated recurrent neural network and logistic regression is used to learn the spatiotemporal correlation more robustly and predict the perceptual quality score. In addition, conditional video block-wise constraints are incorporated into the objective function to improve quality estimation performance for the entire video. The experimental results show that the proposed method extracts spatiotemporal motion information more effectively and predicts the video quality with higher accuracy than the conventional no-reference video quality assessment methods."
Finding the best suited autoencoder for reducing model complexity,2021,"['Autoencoder', 'feature engineering', 'feature extraction', 'feature reduction', 'machine learning']",,"Basically, machine learning models use input data to produce results. Sometimes, the input data is too complicated for the models to learn useful patterns. Therefore, feature engineering is a crucial data preprocessing step for constructing a proper feature set to improve the performance of such models. One of the most efficient methods for automating feature engineering is the autoencoder, which transforms the data from its original space into a latent space. However certain factors, including the datasets, the machine learning models, and the number of dimensions of the latent space (denoted by k), should be carefully considered when using the autoencoder. In this study, we design a framework to compare two data preprocessing approaches: with and without autoencoder and to observe the impact of these factors on autoencoder. We then conduct experiments using autoencoders with classifiers on popular datasets. The empirical results provide a perspective regarding the best suited autoencoder for these factors."
Mirodenafil ameliorates skin fibrosis in bleomycin-induced mouse model of systemic sclerosis,2021,"['Fibrosis', 'systemic sclerosis', 'mirodenafil', 'cyclic guanosine monophosphate']",,"Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. Despite the recent advances in the pathogenesis and treatment of SSc, effective therapies for fibrosis caused by SSc have not yet been established. In this study, we investigated the potential role of mirodenafil, a potent phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, in the treatment of fibrosis in SSc. We used a bleomycin (BLM)-induced SSc mouse model to mimic the typical features of fibrosis in human SSc and examined the dermal thickness to assess the degree of skin fibrosis after staining with hematoxylin and eosin or Masson’s trichrome stains. The effect of mirodenafil on the expression of profibrotic genes was also analyzed by treating fibroblasts with transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and mirodenafil. We showed that mirodenafil ameliorated dermal fibrosis and downregulated the protein levels of fibrosis markers including COL1A1 and α- SMA in the BLM-induced SSc mouse model. Further, using mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human lung fibroblasts, we demonstrated that the expression of collagen and profibrotic genes was reduced by treatment with mirodenafil. Finally, we showed that mirodenafil inhibited TGF-β- induced phosphorylation of Smad2/3 in fibroblasts, which suggested that this drug may ameliorate fibrosis by suppressing the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that mirodenafil possesses a therapeutic potential for treating fibrosis in SSc."

At present, the pathogenesis of insomnia is not clear. Animal models can help us understand the pathogenesis of the disease and can be used in transformational medicine. Therefore, it is very necessary to establish an appropriate model of insomnia. Clinical data show that insomnia patients with high levels of thyroxine and often accompanied by cardiovascular problems, a common mechanism underlying all of these physiological disruptions is the sympathetic nervous system. Combined with the characteristics of chronic onset of clinical insomnia, an insomnia model induced by long-term intraperitoneal injection of thyroid hormone has been created in our laboratory.

Since they are frequently used in grid systems, the failure of a solid-state-transformer has a great impact on the energy-saving and normal operation of network systems.

First, the uneven current flow phenomenon of paralleled IGBT modules is introduced.

Many existing studies have revealed that compliance with the golden time in response to a disaster determines the success or failure of relief activities, and logistics costs account for 80% of the disaster response cost. Besides, the agility, responsiveness, and effectiveness of the humanitarian logistics system are emphasized in consideration of the disaster situation’s characteristics, such as the urgency of life-saving and rapid environmental changes.

Phase Transformation Modeling for Hypo Peritectic Steel in Continuous Cooling,2021,['Hypo peritectic steel · Modeling · Phase transformation · Continuous cooling'],,"Phase change of steel during cooling affects the slab qualities in continuous casting. Especially, crack susceptibility of hypoperitectic steel is high because large volume shrinkage occurs by peritectic phase transformation during solidification andcooling. In continuous cooling, phase change is different from the behaviors under the equilibrium condition, such as undercoolingand extend of peritectic reaction, etc. Therefore, we develop a new phase change model considering thermodynamics,empirical equations, and carbon diffusion in each phase to predict phase change behavior during continuous cooling. Inthis model, phase change of hypo peritectic steel comprises 5 stages until all phases become the γ phase. The velocities ofthe δ/γ interface and phase fractions during cooling are calculated according to cooling rate, undercooling of the γ phase,and carbon contents. The results show that if solidification ends by the δ phase during dTp,the γ phase is formed by massivetransformation. On the contrary, if peritectic reaction starts with liquid, the γ phase is formed and grows by diffusionaltransformation. In latter case, massive transformation of remaining δ phase can occur with high undercooling or very fastcooling rates. This analysis shows that there are several different paths depending on carbon contents of hypo peritectic steels."

DPIM-Based InSAR Phase Unwrapping Model and a 3D Mining-Induced Surface Deformation Extracting Method: A Case of Huainan Mining Area,2021,"['D-InSAR', 'Phase unwrapping', 'Mining subsidence', 'LOS deformation', 'Three-dimensional deformation']",,"The mining subsidence in mining area could cause large-gradient deformation in a short period of time. When the deformation gradient exceeds the threshold value of the Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (D-InSAR) technology monitoring gradient, D-InSAR technology is likely to cause the failure of InSAR phase unwrapping algorithm. At this time, the InSAR technology is unable to monitor the 3D surface deformation. Aiming at these problems, an dynamic probability integral method (DPIM)-based InSAR phase unwrapping model and a method of extracting 3D surface deformation were proposed. The phase unwrapping model firstly used the empirical parameters of the probability integral of the mining face to predict the line of sight (LOS) direction deformation phase of the mining subsidence surface. Secondly, the phase of differential interferogram was unwrapped with the assist of the predicted LOS deformation phase under the constraint of DPIM, and the true LOS deformationphase was obtained, then the true LOS deformation phase transformed into LOS deformation. Finally, according to the geometric projection relationship between the LOS deformation and 3D deformation of mining subsidence surface, the probability integral prior model was brought into the equation of the geometric projection relationship. On the basis of relevant boundary conditions, the 3D surface deformation was extracted from the LOS direction deformation field of mining subsidence. The feasibility of the method was verified by the simulation experiment results. The differential interferogram of the subsidence basin was obtained by the differential interference processing of image data of Sentinel-1A on Nov. 16, 2017 and Dec. 10, 2017 of 1613 working face of Guqiao South Mine. By using the DPIM-based phase unwrapping model, the phase of differential interferogram was unwrapped and the 3D surface deformation during this period as well as the deformation extraction method were developed. The results showed that the maximum fitting error value of subsidence was 79 mm, about 8.33% of the maximum value of subsidence, and the fitting error of mean square of subsidence was ±33.5 mm. The results showed that the DPIM-based phase unwrapping model and the method of extracting 3D surface deformation proposed in this paper have certain engineering application values."

Thus, this work aims in finding a mean to reduce martensite fraction andincrease phase diversity in weld nugget. The prediction of phase transformation during RSW has been done. Simulationshave been performed for 2 mm AISI 1010 sheets and results show that the application of post weld heat treatment leads tothe reduction of martensite fraction, and formation of ferrite and bainite in the nugget. Welding experiments have been donein parallel and experimental weld nugget geometry is in good agreement with simulation results."

To investigate the real contact between the pinion and the gear, a rapid prototype machine was used to manufacture a real gear pair. Three of the teeth on the real gear were coated with dyes. After running the gear for long time, the dyes on the teeth were scraped and rubbed, and they were evenly rolled over the teeth."

Topology and start-up strategy for DC-DC transformers based on voltage balancing unit,2021,"['DC distribution network', 'Input series output parallel (ISOP)', 'DC solid-state transformer (DCSST)', 'Voltage balancing unit (VBU)', 'Start-up strategy']",,"As a core piece of equipment in DC distribution networks, DC solid-state transformers (DCSSTs) are attracting more and more attention in academia and industry. Due to the limitations in terms of the electrical stress of the switches, the input series output parallel (ISOP) structure is adopted in DCSSTs. This paper proposed an improved DCSST topology based on a voltage balancing unit (VBU). This topology has the advantages of higher power density, reduced weight, and cascaded number without compromising efficiency, cost, or reliability. The working modes, mathematical models, and control strategy are analyzed. In addition, a start-up strategy and a parameter design method are proposed in this paper. Simulation and experimental results verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed solution. The proposed DCSST is a practical scheme for the application of DC distribution networks."

Weighted rank estimation for nonparametric transformation models with doubly truncated data,2021,"['Covariate-dependent truncation', 'Iterative marginal optimization', 'Log-concave error density', 'Maximum rank correlation', 'U statistic']",,"Doubly truncated data often arise when event times are observed only if they fall within subject-specifc intervals. We analyze doubly truncated data using nonparametric transformation models, where an unknown monotonically increasing transformation of the response variable is equal to an unknown monotonically increasing function of a linear combination of the covariates plus a random error with an unspecifed log-concave probability density function. Furthermore, we assume that the truncation variables are conditionally independent of the response variable given the covariates and leave the conditional distributions of truncation variables given the covariates unspecifed. For estimation of regression parameters, we propose a weighted rank (WR) estimation procedure and establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the resulting estimator. The limiting covariance matrix of the WR estimator can be estimated by a resampling technique, which does not involve nonparametric density estimation or numerical derivatives. A numerical study is conducted and suggests that the proposed methodology works well in practice, and an illustration based on real data is provided."
Personality Prediction Based on Text Analytics Using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers from English Twitter Dataset,2021,"['Personality prediction', 'Twitter', 'Big Five personality traits', 'BERT']",,"Personality traits can be inferred from a person’s behavioral patterns. One example is when writing posts on social media. Extracting information about individual personalities can yield enormous benefits for various applications such as recommendation systems, marketing, or hiring employees. The objective of this research is to build a personality prediction system that uses English texts from Twitter as a dataset to predict personality traits. This research uses the Big Five personality traits theory to analyze personality traits, which consist of openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Several classifiers were used in this research, such as support vector machine, convolutional neural network, and variants of bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT). To improve the performance, we implemented several feature extraction techniques, such as N-gram, linguistic inquiry and word count (LIWC), word embedding, and data augmentation. The best results were obtained by fine-tuning the BERT model and using it as the main classifier of the personality prediction system. We conclude that the BERT performance could be improved by using individual tweets instead of concatenated ones."

Predicting Mechanical State of High-Speed Railway Elevated Station Track System Using a Hybrid Prediction Model,2021,"['High-speed railway', 'Elevated station track system', 'Structural health monitoring', 'Structural state prediction', 'Convolutional neural network', 'Long short-term memory']",,"Elevated station track system is one of the most vulnerable parts in high-speed railway and prone to various defects during long-term service.

Therefore, it can be said that the development of an infectious disease treatment that can be used when contracting COVID-19 is a very important issue. However, developing a treatment for COVID-19 requires more time than developing a vaccine. There are many reasons, but among the many drug candidates that can be used in remedy, until a good drug candidate is found that can inhibit or overcome COVID-19, experiments on cell culture and chemical reactions must continue and iteratively, and the results of the chemical reaction must be evaluated. This is because researchers have to check and make judgments one by one. Therefore, in this paper, in order to shorten the clinical trial time required for the development of a remedy agent for the COVID-19, we designed a system that can automatically transform and show the chemical reaction result when a candidate drugs are administered to the COVID-19 virus in a short time and the performance was evaluated. A style transformation model based on StarGAN-v2 designed in this paper supports conversion between multiple styles. In addition, using the automated style transformation model, a candidate drug or compound is directly administered to a specific virus cell and the results can be simulated quickly without waiting for the results of a clinical trial waiting for the results. Therefore, if the style transformation model designed in this paper is used as a simulator for administration results in the clinical trial stage of new drug development, it will be able to contribute to shortening the clinical trial procedure and time"

Accurately predicting future information is crucial because it is used for establishing strategies or making policy decisions in various fields. Recently, a transformer model has been mainly studied for a time series prediction model. However, the existing transformer model has a limitation in that it has an auto-regressive structure in which the output result is input again when the prediction sequence is output. This limitation causes a problem in that accuracy is lowered when predicting a distant time point. This paper proposes a sequential decoding model focusing on the style transformation technique to handle these problems and make more precise time series forecasting. The proposed model has a structure in which the contents of past data are extracted from the transformer-encoder and reflected in the style-based decoder to generate the predictive sequence. Unlike the decoder structure of the conventional auto-regressive transformer, this structure has the advantage of being able to more accurately predict information from a distant view because the prediction sequence is output all at once. As a result of conducting a prediction experiment with various time series datasets with different data characteristics, it was shown that the model presented in this paper has better prediction accuracy than other existing time series prediction models."

The series expansion method is inadequately accurate for certain time values and converges very slowly.

Currently utilized data in architecture exists in various forms, making it difficult to manage and use the accumulated design information for other reasons. Therefore, this study proposes developing and utilizing technologies that recognize floorplan sketches, one of the analog media, and convert them into digital media, BIM, that computers can understand. (Method) This study is conducted in two parts: 1) floorplan sketch recognition, 2) utilization of recognized floorplan sketches. In the floorplan sketch recognition phase, we propose an approach that applies Generative Adversarial Network-based deep learning techniques to transform human-drawn floorplan sketch styles into one unified form. Specifically, to recognize the floorplan sketches, the deep learning model learns various forms of floorplan sketches and the styles it needs to transform in pairs. The consistent style has essential architectural elements labeled on it : wall, floor, door and window objects. The study uses apartment floorplan images as learning data for floorplan sketch recognition deep-learning model. The apartment floor plan dataset provided by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport Seumteo(e-ais) consists of scanned floorplan images of apartments, houses, and row houses in Seoul. In the phase of the utilization of perceived floorplan sketches, BIM models were generated based on the recognized floorplan sketches. They were subdivided and vectorized by object to extract coordinates, and this enabled BIM models to be obtained by using them as input values for Revit API. (Results) The floorplan sketches labeled with essential architectural elements were the output for the floorplan sketch recognition module, and it was successfully printed out. For the analysis of the study, the predicted image was compared by the ground truth image and showed success. For the second phase, the BIM model prototype made on the Autodesk Revit platform created a fast and accurate 3D BIM model when the recognized floorplan sketches were given input. The created model is low in detail, but it contains the geometry information and the property information, making it an easier way for future use. (Conclusion) This research and development is a sub-development of the overall intelligent design system. It identifies whether computers can recognize one of the design information, floorplan sketches as human beings, and suggests its potentials. Subsequent studies are believed to obtain a BIM model with a high level of detail if recognition is achieved by scaling out of the current recognizable target range."

We selected 3D virtual garment programs, formed virtual models in a representative size for high-school male cyclists, and analyzed them using the Design-X program. The results were as follows. In the 3D virtual garment programs, the anthropometric items for virtual model forming differed significantly from the standard anthropometric items suggested by Size Korea. Comparing the lower body scan data and virtual models formed by the 3D virtual garment programs, the biggest difference was in the shapes of the waist and hips, i.e., the flatness values of the waist and hips were different for each program in the cross-section view. In the lower body, a data-input-based program was needed for changing the exact measurement position of the waist circumference and hips' shape in detail. If a 3D virtual garment program provides functions for the virtual model's joint angle input and free motion transformation, it is expected to be widely used in the sportswear industry."

This study aims to examine whether Council-Manager model (CM), which is often discussed as an alternative can be a suitable model for Korean local politics. Previous studies based on anti-political ideas tend to exclude party politics in local area and suggest the CM to improve the efficiency of legislation and administrative process. However, this study points out that there is a contradiction in the argument that it is less efficient in the current local government structure monopolized by a hegemonic party. This article argues that Korean local party politics is different with the U.S. in the 20th century, which introduced the CM to eliminate the evils of machine politics. And since there are conflicting theories and mixed empirical results in the evaluation of the CM, these points should be carefully considered when local government transforming. Also, the discourse on reforming local government form needs to be reconsidered from a democratic side rather than an efficiency and the role of a political party should not be ruled out to establish the principle of resident sovereignty."

For this, the current status and problems of academic writing courses were reviewed. The definition of academic writing is not easy, and it is difficult to learn and teach writing. To solve this problem, a learner-oriented writing model based on the proven useful framework of argumentative writing (the so-called O.R.E.O. Frame) was needed.Additionally, some guidelines were suggested to maximize learning effectiveness: (1) Subjects of writing should be freely selected based on learners’ own interests.(2) The professor’s comments should be minimal. (3) The evaluation of the writing is made in accordance with the criteria of “more preferable or less”, not the dichotomous standard of “right/wrong.” (4) The references should not be limited to strict academic literature.The model suggested in this paper can be regarded as a learning model of the minimization strategy. In other words, not all problems related to learning efficient academic writing can be solved through the model suggested in this paper. If the suggested model can be used in the case where academic writing learning is needed in very poor class conditions, this paper can be said to be sufficiently significant."

성장의 한계를 둘러싼 독일에서의 논의와 젠더적 함의: 마리아 미즈의 빙산 모델을 중심으로,2021,"['독일', '성장의 한계', '마리아 미즈', '빙산 모델', '젠더', 'Germany', 'limits of growth', 'Maria Mies', 'iceberg model', 'gender']","오늘날 전 세계적으로 성장의 한계를 둘러싼 논의가 다양하게 진행 중이다. 특히 독일은 생태적 한계로 인한 성장의 한계에 대한 문제의식이 가장 먼저 싹트며 이와 관련된 논의가 가장 활발하게 전개되어 온 나라의 하나다. 성장이 누구나 바라는 목표인 것처럼 간주되는 한, 그리고 성장이 진보든 보수든 모두가 동의하는 정치적 목표로 간주되는 한, 무급 돌봄노동을 비롯한 여성의 다양한 활동이 ‘경제’에서 그 의미를 제대로 획득하기는 사실상 불가능하다. 따라서 성장의 한계를 둘러싼 독일에서의 논의는 젠더 관점에서 볼 때 그 함의가 크다. 그러나 성장의 한계를 둘러싼 지금까지의 논의에서는 성장 패러다임을 넘어선 사회를 젠더 관점에서 탐색하고자 하는 시도가 아직은 주변부에 머물러 있다. 이런 맥락에서 일찍이 1980년대부터 성장의 한계를 젠더 관점에서 분석해 온 독일의 대표적인 사회학자 마리아 미즈의 ‘자본주의적 가부장제 경제의 빙산 모델’로 시선을 돌릴 필요가 있다. 미즈는 빙산 모델을 중심으로 자본주의적 가부장제 경제가 여성과 자연과 식민지에 대한 착취에 기초해 있음을 밝히는 한편으로, 이를 넘어서기 위한 방안으로 ‘자급 관점’을 제시함으로써, 사회적·생태적 및 젠더적 전환에 기초한 탈성장사회로의 길을 열어주고 있다. 미즈가 탈성장사회라는 개념을 직접 사용하고 있지는 않지만, 성장의 한계에 대한 에코페미니즘적 비판을 통해, 젠더와 탈성장의 만남을 일찍부터 준비해 왔음을 기억할 필요가 있다.","Today, there are various discussions on the limits of growth around the world. Germany, in particular, is one of the countries in which the awareness of the problem of the limits of growth caused by ecological limitations has emerged very early and have been discussed very actively. As long as growth is regarded as a desired goal for everyone and a political goal to which everyone agrees, whether progressive or conservative, it is virtually impossible that various activities of women, including unpaid care work, will properly acquire its meaning in the ‘economy’. Therefore, the discussion about the limits of growth has important implications from a gender perspective. However, in the mainstream debate over the limits of growth, attempts to explore a degrowth society from a gender perspective have remained on the margins. In this context, it is necessary to turn to the ‘iceberg model of the capitalist-patriarchal economy’ by Maria Mies, a German sociologist who has analyzed the limits of growth from a gender perspective since the 1980s. Mies revealed that the capitalist-patriarchal economy is based on the exploitation of women, nature, and colonies and suggested a ‘subsistence perspective’ as a way to overcome it. With this suggestion of a social-ecological and feminist transformation of a growth-based society, Mies paved the way to lead to a degrowth society. Although Mies didn’t directly use the concept of degrowth, it is necessary to remember that her ecofeminist critique of the limits of growth has prepared us for the encounter of gender and degrowth."
MicroRNA-21 inhibition attenuates airway inflammation and remodelling by modulating the transforming growth factor β-Smad7 pathway,2021,"['Asthma', 'MicroRNA-21', 'Smad7', 'Airway remodelling']",,"Background/Aims: Current asthma therapies remain unsatisfactory for controlling airway remodelling in asthma. MicroRNA-21 is a key player in asthma pathogenesis, but the molecular mechanisms underlying its effects on airway remodelling are not completely understood. We investigated the effects of inhibition of microRNA-21 on allergic airway inflammation and remodelling.Methods: Female BALB/c mice were divided into four groups: control, ovalbumin-sensitized and -challenged for 3 months, microRNA-negative control-treated ovalbumin-treated, and microRNA-21 inhibitor-treated ovalbumin-treated groups. Parameters related to airway remodelling, cytokine production, airway inflammation, and airway hyperresponsiveness were compared between groups. Human bronchial smooth muscle cells were used in a mechanism study.Results: In this asthma model, ovalbumin-sensitized and -challenged mice exhibited allergic airway inf lammation and airway remodelling. MicroRNA-21 inhibitor-treated mice had fewer inflammatory cells, lower T<sub>H</sub>2 cytokine production, and suppressed parameters related to remodelling such as goblet cell hyperplasia, collagen deposition, hydroxyproline content, and expression of smooth muscle actin. Inhibition of microRNA-21 decreased transforming growth factor β1 expression and induced Smad7 expression in lung tissue. In human bronchial smooth muscle cells stimulated with transforming growth factor β1, microRNA-21 inhibition upregulated Smad7 expression and decreased markers of airway remodelling.Conclusions: Inhibition of microRNA-21 had both anti-inflammatory and anti-remodelling effects in this model of ovalbumin-induced chronic asthma. Our data suggest that the microRNA-21-transforming growth factor β1-Smad7 axis modulates the pathogenesis of ovalbumin-induced chronic asthma and in human bronchial smooth muscle cells. MicroRNA-21 inhibitors may be a novel therapeutic target in patients with allergic asthma, especially those with airway remodelling."

Healing is to activate one's own vitality blocked by the traumatic disorder so that the libido flows.

In this study, we determined the role of predicted CTGF-targeting microRNAs (miRNAs) in rat models of aortic stenosis and reverse cardiac remodeling.Methods: Minimally invasive ascending aortic banding was performed in 24 7-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats, which were divided into three groups. The banding group consisted of eight rats that were sacrificed immediately after 6 weeks of aortic constriction. The debanding group underwent aortic constriction for 4 weeks and was sacrificed 2 weeks after band removal. The third group underwent sham surgery. We investigated the expression of CTGF, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1), and matrix metalloproteinase-2 using ELISA and examined miRNA-26b, miRNA-133a, and miRNA-19b as predicted CTGF-targeting miRNAs based on miRNA databases in 24-hour TGFβ-stimulated and TGFβ-washed fibroblasts and myocardial tissues from all subjects.Results: CTGF was elevated in 24-hour TGFβ-stimulated fibroblasts and decreased in 24-hour TGFβ-washed fibroblasts. miRNA-26b was significantly increased in TGFβ-washed fibroblasts compared with control and TGFβ-stimulated fibroblasts (p < 0.05). CTGF expression was significantly higher in the banding group than that in the sham and debanding groups. The relative expression levels of miRNA-26b were higher in the debanding group than in the banding group.Conclusions: The results of our study using models of aortic banding and debanding suggested that miRNA-26b was significantly increased after aortic debanding. The in vitro model yielded the same results: miRNA-26b was upregulated after removal of TGFβ from fibroblasts."

The purpose of this study is to construct a spatial model useful for digital spatial creation that attempts to place the unconscious world or the artist’s imaginary world in the real space by overlapping the dual structure of virtual and reality. Therefore, in this paper, as a new approach to digital spatial creation, it was attempted as a spatial medium that reinforces the real world among the dual structures by establishing The Immersive spatial model converge real spatial information.

The research results are as follows.  First, The Immersive spatial model converge real spatial information can enhance the sense of presence in the virtual world. Second, a high degree of freedom for space can be given to both space creators and users.

We designed a novel inverse kinematics (IK) solver that calculates the updated positions of mesh vertices with fewer computing operations. Through our user interface, one or more markers are selected on the surface of the model and their target positions are set, then the system updates the positions of surface vertices to construct a deformed model. The IK solving process for updating vertex positions includes many computations for obtaining transformations of the markers, their affecting joints, and their parent joints. Many of these computations are often redundant. We precompute those redundant terms in advance so that the 3-nested loop computation structure was improved to a 2-nested loop structure, and thus the computation time for a deformation is greatly reduced. This novel IK solver can be adopted for efficient performance in various research fields, such as handling 3D models implemented by LBS method, or object tracking without any markers."

Digital transformation induces change in the public domain, centering on the government and the National Assembly, and in the private domain, it is driving changes of the industrial structure and business. Now, in South Korea, it is necessary to discuss an efficient governance system suitable for innovation and change in intelligent information society by the digital transformation.  In Korea, new digital transformations such as e-government administrative services, the Blue House National Petition System, the National Assembly’s e-petition system and legislative database, and the disclosure of the database of judicial decisions will contribute to public communication and policy realization. Such a system functions as a bottom-up method to collect public opinion. Furthermore, the results of AI and big data analysis, led by the president and each agency head, are participated by experts, so that top-down governance can be effective. All of these policies must be gathered in the National Assembly to create new governance through final coordination with a private will. Reasonable governance eliminates unnecessary regulations and requires a reasonable legal system based on data.  In the private realm, C-suite should be the driving force behind the digital transformation agenda, and should take an attitude to challenge the business model restructured using digital, rather than sticking to the company""s previous success experiences. Furthermore, the development of cloud computing and user protection are essential in digital transformation, and related act has already been implemented. Due to the post-covid 19 situation, digital transformation will accelerate further, so that the primary and secondary industries will be converted to smart farms and smart factories, respectively, and the entire tertiary industry will be converted to digital. Therefore, the government should promote governance appropriate to these changes.  In the future governance of intelligent information society, efforts should be made to expand public goods, efficiently distribute resources, and effectively resolve disputes and conflicts through using digital technologies. Even in this process, it is necessary to continue legal review to enable the realization of the digital transformation by reviewing the domestic and international aspects of digital transformation that enable the conventional constitutional state system and human rights protection system to function better.  Therefore, this paper considers new governance system that ① companies and governments should collect various agendas in the process and method of decision-making in each digital tower and analyze them through AI, ② Decision makers and experts make key policy decisions based on AI’s predictions and recommendations. This research proposes the use of data-based digital governance and artificial intelligence governance for democratic governance and legal governance according to the constitution."

기도 신학 : 욕망(desire)의 변화(transformation)를 중심으로,2021,"['기도', '욕망의 변화', '삼위일체', '사라 코클리', '닛사의 그레고리우스', 'Prayer', 'Transformation', 'Trinity', 'Sarah Coakley', 'Gregory of Nyssa']","기도하는 방법(Lex orandi)은 믿는 방식(lex credendi)과 별개가 아니다. 기도와 신 학적 교리는 결코 떨어져 생각할 수 없다. 기도란 무엇인가에 대한 응답은 여러 차원 에서 논의할 수 있다. 그러나 필자는 기도의 역할, 기도의 결과에 대해 집중한다. 왜 냐하면, 기도에 대한 정의는 기도를 통한 삶의 변화에 따라 달라질 수 있기 때문이고, 나아가 기도에 대한 ‘정의’(definition)와 ‘실천’(praxis)의 이분법적 접근을 피할 수 있 기 때문이다. 사라 코클리(Sarah Coakley)는 기도를 삶에서 나타나는 실천 또는 생활 방식으로 분류한다. 기도는 기도하는 사람의 내적인 변화와 외적인 삶의 변화를 통해 완성된다. ‘성자’ 예수 그리스도의 이름으로 ‘성부’ 하나님께 드려진 기도는 변화 (transformation)를 이루는 원동력인데, 여기서 ‘성령’이 이끄는 힘에 의지한 우리들의 실천도 간과될 수 없다. 이를 통해 보았을 때, 기도는 삼위일체 교리와 밀접한 관계가 있다. 삼위일체 교리는 기도를 통해서 형성되었고 동시에 기도를 위한 것이다. 사라 코클리(Sarah Coakley)는 성부와 성자 중심의 전통적 삼위일체를 “위계적 모델”이라 명명하고, 이를 넘어서 성령의 역할을 재조명함으로써 새로운 삼위일체 모델을 제시 한다. 성령은 유한과 무한, 타자와 자기를 잇는 사랑의 끈이요 매개이다. 성령의 중보와 도움으로 유한한 인간이 삼위일체 하나님의 경륜적 삶에 동참할 수 있고, 나아가 하나님과 연합한 존재로 변화된 삶을 살 수 있다. 따라서, 코클리가 주장하는 바, “성 령 주도적” 삼위일체론(Spirit-led incorporative Trinity)은 기도를 통한 우리들의 인 식과 존재의 변화를 위해 형성된 교리이다. 이를 위한 코클리의 신학적 방법론은 닛 사의 그레고리우스(Gregory of Nyssa)로부터 영향을 받았고, 그 핵심에 ‘욕망(desire)’ 의 ‘변화’(transformation)라는 개념이 있다. 프로이드 이후 형성된 욕망에 대한 개념 은 수정되어야 한다. 플라톤이 사용한 에로스(eros)와 욕망(desire)은 성적인 합일을 위한 욕구 불만의 표출이 아니라, 신적인 것을 향한 갈망이었다. 그레고리우스는 영성 신학적 관점에서 이를 수정 보완하였는데, 거룩한 하나님과 연합하고자 하는 갈망이 다. 욕망의 변화는 기도를 통해 가능하다. 성령 안에서, 성령을 통해 기도할 때, 우리 가 성부 하나님의 사랑을 알 수 있고, 성자 예수 그리스도를 본받아 하나님과 연합할 뿐 아니라, 변화된 존재로 살아갈 수 있다. 따라서, 본 논고는 삼위일체 교리와 기도 의 연관성에 대해 논증할 뿐 아니라, 기도 신학은 인간에 대한 이해와 더불어 구원론 에 대한 새로운 길을 제시한다고 주장한다.","Lex orandi, lex credendi; the law of what is to be prayed is never to be separated from the law of what is to be believed. It is not easy to define what Christian prayer is. Still, the author focuses on the role and result of prayer, keeping away from separating the relationship between definition and praxis in praying. According to Sarah Coakley, prayer itself is life and the way to transform lives, which is constructing with and in the doctrine of Trinity: praying in the Son, Jesus Christ, praying to the Father God, and through the Holy Spirit. Sarah Coakley shows the strong relationship between the way of prayer and Christian doctrine by delving into a new model of the Trinity. Coakley argues convincingly that the Spirit plays a pivotal role in our understanding of the being and life of God. The Holy Spirit is to ensure liaison between the Father and the Son in love. In so doing, the finite, human being, can participate in the infinite’s salvific life. This new approach is referred to as a Spirit-led incorporative model for the Trinity. Coakley derives her understanding of the Trinity from the thought of Gregory of Nyssa, especially the concept of desire and transformation. The concept of desire, after Post-Freudian, should be modified. In his work, Symposium, Plato asserts that eros and desire are toward the infinite or divine. But, in Gregory's theology of spirituality, eros is employed, meaning to unite with God in and through praying. Prayer is how transformation occurs, leading us to be in union with God. Praying in and through the Holy Spirit, all Christians can realize what God the Father’s love is, unite with Jesus Christ by imitatio Christi, and finally live as the transformed and the transformer. Thus, the doctrine of Trinity and praying are in a strong relationship, developing a theology of prayer, which gives us new eyes that enable us to see new theological anthropology and soteriology"
Transformation from traditional schools to alternative schools: curriculum leadership of the principals of Taiwanese aborigines,2021,"['Alternative education', 'Taiwanese aborigines', 'Theory of communicative action', 'Experimental education', 'Transformative curriculum leadership']",,"Loosened by the laws and regulations, Taiwan’s alternative educational policy has allowed public schools to conduct school-wide curriculum transformation experiments, which is a possible opportunity for Taiwanese aborigines who have been subjected to long-term oppression and assimilation to separate from the mainstream ideological educational framework. In this change process, the school principal-led curriculum transformation has become an important way to seek a new educational model. This paper qualitatively investigates two alternative schools for Taiwanese aborigines that have undergone successful transformation and collects the views of the principals, directors, team leaders, and teachers (eight persons in total) in two schools on the school principal-led curriculum transformation. Through summarizing and analyzing relevant data, this paper proposes that the principals of Taiwanese aboriginal schools effectively change the teachers’ beliefs, curriculum structure, and school culture through the systematic practices of “belief change” and “structural innovation,” and establish a curriculum paradigm different from mainstream education, which realizes a certain knowledge transfer effect. The transformative curriculum leadership process can be summarized into the conflict awakening and positioning stage, the experimental and interactive development stage, and the revision and transformation stage. This study intents to provide a reference for Taiwan’s educational reform and encourage the principals of other alternative schools to picture the connotation and value of transformative curriculum leadership and establish more new curriculum models of alternative education."

The cities are surrounded by open areas, agricultural land, and forests, where fire incidence can make human lives threatening, damaging their properties as well. Recently, vision sensors-based fire detection has attracted computer vision domain experts, where the leading performance is achieved by a variety of convolution neural networks(CNN) in the recent literature. However, these techniques are translation invariant, locality-sensitive, and lacking a global understanding of images. Furthermore, CNN-based models use the pooling layers strategy for dimensionality reduction to reduce the computational cost but it also loses a lot of meaningful information such as the precise location of the most active feature detector. To overcome these problems, in this work, we developed Vision Transformers(ViT) based model for fire detection. The ViT split the input image into image patches and then feed these patches to the transformer in a sequence structure similar to word embeddings. We evaluate the performance of the proposed work on the benchmark fire dataset and achieve good results when compared to state-of-the-art(SOTA) fire detection CNN models."
Deep Learning Based Emotion Recognition with the Use of Time-Scale Two-Dimensional Transformation from Electrocardiogram Signals,2021,"['Ensemble Deep Models', 'Emotion Recognition', 'ASCERTAIN Sentiment Database', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Two-Dimensional Time-Scale Representation']",,"This paper describes the design of ensemble deep models based on time-scale transformation from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for emotion recognition. As the number of senior citizens living alone increases, emotion robots that can interact with them and other emotion robots are becoming increasingly important. Existing emotion robots usually recognized emotion through images of the user’s facial expressions or voice signals. However, there are many situations where the user’s emotions cannot read under various environments. Therefore, research on recognizing the user’s emotions through ECG signals among different biomedical signals is actively being conducted. The proposed method converts ECG signals into various types of two-dimensional time-scale representations. We then designed a four-stream deep learning model by applying it to an ensemble form and transfer learning. Finally, an experiment was conducted using the ASCERTAIN sentiment database. This database contains data recorded by 58 people with 9 different emotions. Among these emotions, we used six representatives (surprise, happiness, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness). The experimental results revealed that the presented ensemble deep models showed good performance in comparison with each single deep model and the original model without transformation."

To achieve sustainable growth, the lower income countries must transform from being agriculture dominant economy to being more industry-and services-oriented economy as economic convergence is tightly linked with convergence in economic structures. Extant studies have shown that countries that open to international trade experience rapid structural transformation. This study tries to empirically examine the role of trade in structural transformation across the ASEAN countries during 2000-2018 and whether it has also led to structural convergence. Augmented Chenery-Syrquin model for structural transformation in panel data framework is adopted for analysis. The results reveal that there is evidence of structural convergence, with trade acting as a significant driver. However, the process convergence is still incomplete as the lower income countries have not been able to take full advantage of trade openness, owing to their heavy dependence on agricultural sector. The decline in share of agriculture due to trade is greater for high-income countries as compared to that of low-income countries. Also, for the low-income countries, impact of trade in industrial sector is negligible."

However, in order to cater to the minimalist design trend, the rich information that the modeling of multifunctional furniture should contain is always ignored, which causes users to have a series of usage problems because of cognitive friction when facing “simple” styling. In order to allow the usefulness and usability of multifunctional furniture to be easily perceived by users, the authors conducted a relevant study on the modeling of multifunctional furniture from the perspective of signifier and affordance. The research method of this study is a combination of literature review and case analysis. The authors first sorted out the relationship between signifier and affordance in industrial design through related literature.Then, the authors combined different cases of multifunctional furniture, to analyze the role of the three core elements(shape, color and material) of the modeling as signifiers that carry information specifying affordances during the functional transformation. Finally, the authors found that the modeling of multifunctional furniture can form signifiers with rich information that clearly conveys the corresponding affordances, which is helpful to guide users to form natural interactions with multifunctional furniture. And the authors also put forward the following design steps for multifunctional furniture modeling. Step 1: the functions of multifunctional furniture should be clarified based on the needs of target users, and the actions that users need to perform to switch between different functions should also be determined. The first step is the key to realizing usefulness. Step 2: the modeling of multifunctional furniture should be constructed through different combinations of shapes, colors and materials, which should fully convey the information of the functionality, action possibilities and the operating positions of the corresponding actions. The second step is the key to realizing ease of use. However, these two steps still need to be further deepened in future studies."

In order to review the effect of privacy calculus, consumer response to online behavioral advertising by stages in consumer decision journey was analyzed with privacy calculus model. The effect of privacy calculus is under complex interaction with both perceived usefulness and privacy concern. Lastly, the present study also aimed to describe the effect of advertising’s timeliness on the transformation process of consumer response to online behavioral advertising by consumer decision journey. As a result, by each stage in consumer decision journey, there were significant differences in consumer response to online behavioral advertising. Specific results are as follows; greater perceived usefulness of online behavioral advertising was related with more positive response, while greater privacy concern was associated with more negative response. Perceived usefulness for online behavioral advertising led to positive advertisement attitude, reaction intention, and advertisement acceptance intention. In the stages of consumer decision journey, the perceived usefulness for online behavioral advertising increased from early consideration stage to pre-purchase stage, and then decreased after the purchase was performed. On the other hand, the effect of privacy concern progressively decreased from early consideration stage to purchase-consideration stage, and increased after post-purchase stage. In addition, moderation effect of perceived usefulness in establishment of response to online behavioral advertising by consumer decision journey was assessed. Its regulated moderation effect was confirmed through studying the effect of advertisement’s timeliness in relationship between consumer decision journey and perceived usefulness. The present study has its academic significance in elucidating the different responses to online behavioral advertising depending on the time of encounter to the advertisement, analyzed with consumer decision journey and privacy calculus models. It is expected to provide practical implications in the current situation of steadily growing online behavioral advertising that is targeted in more sophisticated manner."
Review and Strategy for Study on Korean Buffer Characteristics Under the Elevated Temperature Conditions: Mineral Transformation and Radionuclide Retardation Perspective,2021,"['Korean bentonite', 'Elevated temperature conditions', 'Smectite-to-illite transformation', 'Radwaste disposal']",,"In the majority of countries, the upper limit of buffer temperature in a repository is set to below 100℃ due to the possible illitization.This smectite-to-illite transformation is expected to be detrimental to the swelling functions of the buffer. However, if the upper limit is increased while preventing illitization, the disposal density and cost-effectiveness for the repository will dramatically increase. Thus, understanding the characteristics and creating a database related to the buffer under the elevated temperature conditions is crucial. In this study, a strategy to investigate the bentonite found in Korea under the elevated temperatures from a mineral transformation and radionuclides retardation perspective was proposed. Certain long-term hydrothermal reactions generated the bentonite samples that were utilized for the investigation of their mineral transformation and radionuclide retardation characteristics. The bentonite samples are expected to be studied using in-situ synchrotron-based X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) technique to determine the smectite-to-illite transformation. Simultaneously, the ‘high-temperature and high-pressure mineral alteration measurement system’ based on the Diamond Anvil Cell (DAC) will control and provide the elevated temperature and pressure conditions during the measurements. The kinetic models, including the Huang and Cuadros model, are expected to predict the time and manner in which the illitization will become detrimental to the performance and safety of the repository. The sorption reactions planned for the bentonite samples to evaluate the effects on retardation will provide the information required to expand the current knowledge of repository optimization."

Hence, it is urgent to establish a DT strategy to enhance the competitive advantage of companies. This study explores DT’s determinants of Chinese companies using TOE (technology, organization, environment) framework. We surveyed 313 companies (managers) and tested the hypotheses to serve the research purpose. According to the results, most of the determinants (compatibility, trialability, resource readiness, management support, competitive pressure, and bandwagon pressure) positively impact DT adoption. However, complexity has a negative impact on that. Furthermore, the relationship between relative advantage, government support, and DT adoption has not been supported. We expect that this paper provides a valuable practical reference for companies to adopt DT and put forward future research directions to promote a more in-depth study on the DT field."
Transmission Line Modeling and Algorithm Analysis Considering Parameter Asymmetry and Transient High-frequency Components,2021,['Transmission line  · Phase coordinate approach  · Time domain (frequency domain) analysis  · Laplace transform  · Harmonic  · Vectorized NILT'],,"When the power system is disturbed or the operation mode is changed, the electromagnetic transient process will occur, which will lead to the high frequency transient component and aff ect the protection and control of the power system. Therefore, attention should be paid to the analysis of high-frequency transient components when modeling and analyzing the system model. In view of the fact that the symmetrical-component theory is not suitable for asymmetric transmission lines and the phasor method is not suitable for transient analysis and calculation, this paper uses the phase coordinate approach and Laplace transform to derive the node voltage equation of three-phase π type transmission lines in frequency domain, which can be used to calculate the transient response of transmission lines caused by the change of operation mode or disturbance. And vectorized NILT is used to calculate the time domain solution, which greatly improves the calculation speed. The calculated results are basically consistent with those of ATP-EMTP, and can fully refl ect the transient characteristics. This method lays a foundation for analyzing the infl uence of high frequency transient components on power system and fault analysis considering transient process."
The Nexus Between Education and Structural Transformation: Evidence from Vietnam,2021,"['Education', 'Structural Transformation', 'Drop-Out', 'Repeaters', 'Vietnam']",,"Both structural transformation and education are the predominant subjects in the literature of development economics. This study examines the relationship between education before the tertiary level and the structural transformation of provinces by using Vietnam as a case study. In this study, education before the tertiary level would be disaggregated into three groups: primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary, then analyzed simultaneously on three-panel data models. Research data is taken from the statistical yearbook of provinces in Vietnam for 2015–2018. Research results show that education before the tertiary level plays a vital role in structural transformation. The enrolment rate of various education levels has a different influence on economic structure, and the lower secondary level has more significant effects than the upper secondary level. This reflects that participating in lower secondary is a fundamental requirement for taking some jobs in the non-agriculture sector, while upper secondary helps to upgrade the learner’s abilities to respond to higher requirement jobs. The high rate of repeaters in upper secondary education will slow down the structural shift towards non-agriculture, and changing the traditional attitude about repeaters plays an essential role in improving this rate."

Among them, photovoltaics is the most used in industries and homes because it is easy to repair and can be used for a long time. In photovoltaic PCS, parasitic capacitance is generated between the photovoltaic module and the ground due to the installation structure of the photovoltaic module. This parasitic capacitance, VCM, which is a common mode voltage generated by switching of PCS, is applied to CP, and leakage current occurs. In this paper, the common mode voltage characteristics at three-phase three-level, and three-phase two-level were compared. Proposed an equivalent circuit that was equalized from unaffected by grid impedance the point of view of the common-mode by dividing it into a transformerless type PCS connected to the grid ground and a transformer type PCS applying a transformer. The validity of the proposed equivalent circuit was verified by constructing a three-phase three-level PCS and comparing the equivalent circuit using the experiment measurements and PSIM. In the transformerless PCS, the leakage current is equivalent to 1.13A in the equivalent circuit and 1.14A in the experiment. In the transformer type PCS, the equivalent circuit is 68mA and the experiment 70mA. In addition, for the validity of the proposed equivalent circuit, FFT analysis of leakage current, which is the switching frequency, was performed."

"Digital Accounting, Financial Reporting Quality and Digital Transformation: Evidence from Thai Listed Firms",2021,"['Digital Accounting', 'Financial Reporting Quality', 'Accounting Information Usefulness', 'Digital Transformation', 'Strategic Decision Effectiveness']",,"The study examines the effects of digital accounting on financial reporting quality, accounting information usefulness, and strategic decision effectiveness of listed firms in Thailand through digital transformation as the moderating variable. A total of 313 listed firms in Thailand were selected as the sample for the study. Structural equation model and multiple regression analysis are applied to test the research relationships. The results of the study show that digital accounting has a significant effect on financial reporting quality, accounting information usefulness, and strategic decision effectiveness. Financial reporting quality significantly affects both accounting information usefulness and strategic decision effectiveness while accounting information usefulness has a significant effect on strategic decision effectiveness. Both financial reporting quality and accounting information usefulness mediate the digital accounting-strategic decision effectiveness relationship. In addition, digital transformation moderates the digital accounting-financial reporting quality relationship and the digital accounting-accounting information usefulness relationship, but it does not moderate other relationships. Accordingly, digital accounting plays a significant role in determining and explaining firms’ goal achievement. Executives are suggested to learn, invest and utilize the digital accounting system in the organization to ensure goal achievement and enhance organizational sustainability."

The regulatory mechanisms of the main factors (siderite dosage, roasting temperature,and roasting time) on the self-magnetization roasting process were investigated. In-situ kinetic ofthe self-magnetization roasting process was analyzed by the infrared gas analyzer, and the phase transformationwas investigated by in-situ X-ray diffraction and Mössbauer. Under the optimal roasting conditionsof 30% siderite dosage, 730 C, and 7.5 min, the iron concentrate with Fe grade 68.82% and Ferecovery 99.48% was obtained. The kinetic and phase transformation results indicated that the selfmagnetizationroasting process was divided into two stages: siderite pyrolysis in the prophase stage,and hematite reduced to magnetite by reductant (FeO and CO) from siderite pyrolysis in the anaphasestage. The SEM analyses showed that the newborn magnetite crystals were mainly coarse-grained andneedles, which fitted the kinetics characteristics for the Nucleation model. Using self-magnetizationroasting technology, siderite and hematite would promote mutual reduction to improve product magnetismand roasting efficiency without adding reductant. Also, self-magnetization roasting will enhancethe utilization rate of siderite, and it contributes to energy conservation and CO2 emission reduction."

SAHs demonstrated fast swelling and superabsorbent properties, with a swelling capacity of 612 g water/g SAHs. Due to the usefulness of equilibrium and kinetic data for elucidating the nature of adsorbate-adsorbent interaction, the adsorption study was extensively modelled using selected nonlinear isotherm and kinetics models. The Toth and intraparticle diffusion models satisfactorily predicted the isotherm and kinetic data, respectively, while the dominance of the metal complexation mechanism was asserted in the study. Meanwhile, the metal ion uptake by SAHs occurred at a fast equilibration time of 20 min. Furthermore, the adsorbent’s instrumental characterization (scanning electron microscopy, SEM; Energy dispersion X-ray, EDX; X-ray diffraction, XRD and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, FTIR) result confirmed that SAHs possesses the desired metal chelation properties. Thus, the potential application of the developed SAHs as biosorbent in the decontamination of the heavy metal-laden stream was explicitly demonstrated in the study."

To this end, I critically examined the instrumental approaches and technological optimism in the application of digital technology to museums, and scrutinized the recent museological issues, particularly the revision or curtailment of the museum’s publicness amid the spread of neoliberal policy, which have been omitted within those technological approaches. This is because the meaning of Google Art & Culture can be considered more effectively through an extended theoretical reconstruction. Based on these theoretical discussions, I critically reviewed how the non-profit, an important concept that defines the publicness of museums, was adopted and utilized as an business strategy by Google. As a result, I wanted to reveal that the neoliberalization of museums, the failure of the government’s public function, the crisis of museum’s publicness, and Google’s non-profit strategy have been closely related. Armed with advanced digital technology, the GAC project appropriated the publicness of museums as a useful profit-making model. As such, now the concept of publicness of museums is at a point of more controversial and radical transformation than ever before."
Improving Artificial Neural Network Based Streamflow Forecasting Models through Data Preprocessing,2021,"['Hydrological data', 'Data preprocessing', 'Box-Cox transformation', 'ANN models', 'Gamma statistics']",,"The real time hydrological data may contain noise, missing information and deviation from its original scale due to complex and nonlinear nature of hydrological processes. The data when used as it is in hydrological forecasting may create uncertainty in hydrological models, especially in data-driven models which fully rely upon the input-output data. The current research provides a simple preprocessing approach to improve the performance of ANN-based streamflow estimation models through providing a better input state. The two-step preprocessing approach includes; the data transformation through a family of power transformation, the Box-Cox transformation, and the selection of appropriate input variables through the Gamma Test. The original data, which is essentially antecedent upland catchment information of thirteen stations located in Upper Indus Basin (UIB), comprises of twenty inputs, including precipitation, solar radiation and discharge. The Box-Cox transformation has been applied to prepare a transformed data-set and the power factor, λ, (with best value of 0.005), for this transformation, has been determined using probability plots and histogram characteristics. Input combination selection procedure is carried out in WinGamma environment with the help of Genetic Algorithm (GA). Two-layer ANN models have been trained through Broyden, Fletcher and Goldfrab Shano (BFGS) training algorithm for both original and transformed data-sets. The comparison of models clearly indicate that the models developed through transformed data-set showed better performance in both training and testing phases with high values of NSE and R2 which is above 90% in most of the cases, and less other statistical errors including RMSE, VARIANCE and BIAS. Simple preprocessing options, could significantly reduce the uncertainty in ANN based hydrological models through improving the quality of real time hydrological data."

An EM algorithm is proposed to iteratively estimate the time-delays and model parameters. Furthermore, the parameters of the OE model can be yielded based on the parameter estimates of the FIR model through the matrix transformation method. The convergence analysis and simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

Research on Intelligent Dynamic Software Architecture Using Style-based Modeling,2021,"['Software architecture', 'Distributed system', 'Reconfigurable systems', 'Functional business requirements', 'Platform-independent model', 'Platform abstraction and associated platform']",,"A good architectural design allows to capture the overall complexity of large, distributed systems at a higher level of abstraction. This is especially important for reconfigurable systems where the architectural configuration is subject to changes at runtime. When designing such a dynamic architecture, the software architect has to bring the functional business requirements and the available communication and reconfiguration mechanisms of the intended target platform in line. As it is a complex task to incorporate these often diverging requirements into the architectural model, we propose a stepwise approach similar to the MDA initiative. We start with a platform-independent model capturing the business requirements and add platform-specific details in a later step. For each level of platform abstraction and associated platform, we define an architectural style which describes the characteristics of the platform. This way, conformance to the architectural style entails consistency between model and the underlying platform. Besides run-time configurations of components and connections, architectural models also comprise the description of processes that control the communication and reconfiguration behavior. To provide operational semantics, we formalize architectural models as graphs and architectural styles as graph transformation systems. Due to the stepwise procedure, we also have to ensure the mutual consistency between models at different levels of abstraction. For this purpose, we define formal refinement criteria which require that both structural and behavioral properties are preserved at the lower level of abstraction."
A multi-layer approach to DN 50 electric valve fault diagnosis using shallow-deep intelligent models,2021,"['Electric valve', 'Vibration and acoustic signal', 'Support vector machine', 'Particle swarm optimization', 'Deep belief network']",,"Timely fault identification is important for safe and reliable operation of the electric valve system. Many research works have utilized different data-driven approach for fault diagnosis in complex systems. However, they do not consider specific characteristics of critical control components such as electric valves. This work presents an integrated shallow-deep fault diagnostic model, developed based on signals extracted from DN50 electric valve. First, the local optimal issue of particle swarm optimization algorithm is solved by optimizing the weight search capability, the particle speed, and position update strategy. Then, to develop a shallow diagnostic model, the modified particle swarm algorithm is combined with support vector machine to form a hybrid improved particle swarm-support vector machine (IPs-SVM). To decouple the influence of the background noise, the wavelet packet transform method is used to reconstruct the vibration signal. Thereafter, the IPs-SVM is used to classify phase imbalance and damaged valve faults, and the performance was evaluated against other models developed using the conventional SVM and particle swarm optimized SVM. Secondly, three different deep belief network (DBN) models are developed, using different acoustic signal structures: raw signal, wavelet transformed signal and time-series (sequential) signal. The models are developed to estimate internal leakage sizes in the electric valve. The predictive performance of the DBN and the evaluation results of the proposed IPs-SVM are also presented in this paper."

A Classification Method for Power-Quality Disturbances Using Hilbert–Huang Transform and LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks,2021,"['Long short term memory', 'Recurrent neural networks', 'Disturbances classifi cation', 'Hilbert–Huang Transform', 'Power Quality', 'Mode mixing']",,"Power quality disturbances are one of the main problems in an electric power system, where deviations in the voltage and current signals can be evidenced. These sudden changes are potential causes of malfunctions and could aff ect equipment performance at diff erent demand locations. For this reason, a classifi cation strategy is essential to provide relevant information related to the occurrence of the disturbance. Nevertheless, traditional data extraction and detection methods have failed to carry out the classifi cation process with the performance required, in terms of accuracy and effi ciency, due to the presence of a non-stationary and non-linear dynamics, specifi c of these signals. This paper proposes a hybrid approach that involves the implementation of the Hilbert–Huang Transform (HHT) and long short-term memory (LSTM), recurrent neural networks (RNN) to detect and classify power quality disturbances. Nine types of synthetic signals were reproduced and pre-processed taking into account the mathematical models and their specifi cations established in the IEEE 1159 standard. In order to eliminate the presence of mode mixing, the ensemble empirical decomposition (EEMD) and masking signal methods were implemented. Additionally, based on the successful benefi ts of LSTM RNNs reported in the literature, associated to the high accuracy rates achieved at learning long short-term dependencies, this classifi cation technique is implemented to analyze the sequences obtained from the HHT. Based on the experimental results, it is possible to show that the ensemble recognition approach using the EEMD yields a better classifi cation accuracy rate (98.85%) compared with the masking signal and the traditional HHT approach"

Gum Arabic (GA) has been reported to exert anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic activity. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of GA on disease activity in an experimental model of colitis. Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) was used to induce colitis in C57BL/6 mice and the animals were then switched to normal drinking water to monitor recovery. Mice received 140 g/L GA before (pre-GA group) or after (post-GA group) induction of colitis. Disease activity and recovery were assessed by changes in body weight, disease activity index (DAI), and histological assessment. Gene expression of proinflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and fibrotic markers was measured in colonic tissues. Mice in the pre-GA group showed an increase in body weight, with no differences in DAI scores, during the recovery phase and had lower histological colitis scores than mice in the post-GA group, which showed higher DAI and histological scores during the recovery phase. During the recovery phase, mice in the pre-GA group showed increased expression of proinflammatory markers, while gene expression of the fibrotic markers, transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) and procollagen I, was reduced. The reduced fibrotic marker expression was associated with reduced collagen staining and increased epithelial cell proliferation. Administration of GA had protective and alleviative effects on the severity of DSS-induced colitis, with a reduction in colonic fibrosis and TGFβ1 expression. These data warrant further in vitro and in vivo investigations on the effect of GA on fibroblast activity."

This requires a creative study to seek out the contents and method best suited to realizing the educational purpose of the Protestant tradition, though a rigorous academic methodology. The this study proposes just such a creative model for the education of spirituality with an educational purpose based on the core ethos of the Protestant spirituality, integrating the long tradition of spiritual practices of Christianity. First, I survey the teachings on ‘the life of faith’ of the main leaders of the Protestant church, including Martin Luther, John Calvin, and John Wesley. Through this process, I reveal ‘liberated-ness’ to be the common purpose of the Protestant leaders, and the core of the practices for that purpose are ‘the means of grace,’ which has a different meaning from that of the Roman Catholic tradition. I construct the meaning of ‘liberated-ness’ in a dynamic manner, which begins with the ‘liberating will’ of God, and is followed by the ‘self-giving will’ of the believer as the response to the ‘grace’ of the ‘liberating will.’ The contact point of these two ‘wills’ is what I call the ‘living membrane of faith.’ As a creative synthesis of the above discussions, I propose a model of the ‘practice of liberated-ness’ for an education in spiritual practice. The purpose of this education is for the learner to become a person who continuously experiences ever-increasing ‘liberated-ness’ through continuous personal ‘encounters’ with God, and to become ever more faithful in carrying out practices for the ‘liberated-ness’ of her or his neighbors. The relationship between the teacher and the learner is that of personal ‘encounter’ as put forth by Sherrill, and also incorporates elements of ‘co-authorship’ as conceptualized by Kim. I transform and rename major practices of spiritual discipline according to a principle of ‘liberated-ness’ based on the Protestant tradition, and these comprise the main content of my spirituality education model. They include: ‘lectio divina of encounter,’ ‘prayer facing the Lord,’ ‘service in liberation,’ ‘reflection of liberated-ness,’ and ‘mutual spiritual direction.’ The teaching and learning process draws on Dykstra’s methods of coaching and mentoring. The key environment is that of a ‘sacramental community’ as defined by Moore. Evaluation can be performed only by the learner her/himself. The significance of this model is that it creatively inherits and succeeds the tradition of Christian spiritual discipline from the early church onwards by transforming it through a Protestant spirituality of ‘liberated-ness.’"

However, the natural frequency of bridge piers can vary with the support condition of the ground. The aim of this study is to investigate the natural frequency of bridge piers under different ground conditions and at different embedded depths using a small-scale concrete pier. The model piers were fixed to asphalt concrete pavement using epoxy to simulate the rock site condition. Furthermore, model piers of different embedded depths were installed in a soil chamber with dimensions of 1.0 m × 1.0 m × 0.5 m to simulate weathered soil conditions. The upper part of the model pier was hit with a hammer having a rubber tip, and the acceleration signals were measured using three accelerometers installed at the upper, middle, and bottom parts of the model pier. Fast Fourier transforms were performed to analyze the natural frequencies of the model piers. The experimental results showed that the natural frequency under the fixed condition using epoxy was significantly higher than that under the unfixed condition. In the case of weathered soil conditions, three peak points appeared in the frequency domain. The natural frequencies measured at these three points increased with the embedded depth. The increment ratio of the natural frequency with the largest amplitude was significant. This study demonstrates that ground support conditions should be considered when evaluating the integrity of bridge piers through natural frequency analysis."

The data used for the analysis are 10-minute high-frequency data of the KOSPI index and WTI futures price from January 2, 2015, to July 30, 2021. For using the high-frequency data, a heterogeneous autoregression (HAR) model is employed. The analysis model utilizes the advantages of high frequency data to observe the impact of international oil prices through realized volatility, realized skewness, and kurtosis as well as oil price return. In the estimation, the Box-Cox transformation is applied in consideration of the distribution of realized volatility with high skewness. As a result, it finds that the daily return fluctuation of the WTI price has a statistically significant positive (+) effect on the volatility of the KOSPI return. However, the volatility, skewness, and kurtosis of the WTI return do not appear to affect the volatility of the KOSPI return. This result is believed to be because the volatility of the KOSPI return reflects the daily change in the WTI return, but does not reflect the intraday trading behavior of investors."

The educational method or curriculum of the Jesuit college cannot be said to be original in itself. The Jesuit adopted a Paris-style educational method that began by the Brotherhood of the common life and transformed from the University of Paris. Students were divided into classes, learned systematically defined subjects from independent professors, and were promoted to higher classes through examinations. The curriculum also focused on learning Latin and Greek grammar, according to the knowledge system of the time that embraced humanism, and then leading to humanities and rhetoric, followed by philosophy and theology courses. This educational method and curriculum were also accepted at the same time in colleges run by other congregations, and it was natural that there was no significant difference between the Protestant and Catholic regions. Rather, the originality of the Jesuit college is that they tried to provide an overall system and secure unity as much as possible by completing the Ratio Studiorum through long experience. Unlike the schools of Brotherhood of the common life, which had disappeared, and unlike the colleges run by Protestants and secular professors in individual ways, the stable system in Jesuit colleges spread throughout Europe for over 150 years. Although the philosophy and theology courses were modified, the humanities-centered secondary education system was also accepted by other educational congregations or universityaffiliated colleges, becoming a model for secondary education in modern Europe. The Jesuit was dissolved in the mid-18th century, but classical humanities education remained at the core of the European liberal arts class. The elites owning this high culture distinguished themselves from the lower classes until the end of the 19th century, and the legacy of this tradition continues today as well.(Chonnam National University / kim03ji@hotmail.com)"

This manuscript attempts to examine the nature and the process of the ALMP and the educational systems to strengthen it.In Danish vocational education and training system (VET), one can witness remarkable, workable cooperation between labor market and educational system, with its programs pragmatically responding to local demand of innovation and development. Key components of the VET can be hands-on training with local flavor and active participation of stakeholders. The VET’s work-based education such as internship or on-the-job training amounts up to 50∼75% of the entire programs. Social partners in the programs, including trade unions, employers, and local authorities, have officially and/or informally been engaged in planning, implementing and auditing the training programs. Notably, the approach in general education emphasizing entrepreneurship for primary and secondary schoolers inspires their potential for future jobs. Additionally, the paradigm of ‘Responsible University’ contributes to innovation and development of regional labor market.The Danish experiences can provide lessons to Korea, which despite a high level of education struggles to vitalize labor market in sustainable terms.

The spatial scope is the Noryangjin New Town area in Dongjak-gu, Seoul. The temporal range was composed of monthly data from January 2006 to December 2020. Variables that affect the housing sale price, such as the number of years of construction, distance to government offices, and bus stops, are panel data, Macroeconomic variables such as housing transaction volume, housing permits and permits, and CD interest rates were composed of time series data. All variables were log-transformed and used for stabilization of variance. As a result of the Granger causal relationship test, it was found that the housing sale price has a two-way relationship between the housing approval/ permission performance and the housing transaction volume. The CD rate and the number of years of construction had an effect on the housing sale price, but it was found that there was no Grandeur causal relationship. As a result of the shock response function, the shock caused by the housing sale price itself shows a positive (+) response, As for the housing transaction volume, it was found that the housing sale price and the housing license permission performance showed a negative reaction at first, and the shock gradually decreased as time passed."

However, neural vocoders combined with mel-scaled spectrogram prediction models demand considerable computer memory and time during the training phase and are subject to slow inference speeds in an environment where GPU is not used. This problem does not arise in linear spectrogram prediction models, as they do not use neural vocoders, but these models suffer from low voice quality. As a solution, this paper proposes a Tacotron 2 and Transformer-based linear spectrogram prediction model that produces high-quality speech and does not use neural vocoders. Experiments suggest that this model can serve as the foundation of a high-quality text-to-speech model with fast inference speed."

Each feature required to calculate the crack length was transformed to a parameter for a cycle. The model parameters were derived using Bayesian approaches through Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, and the crack growth was predicted. The model accuracy was examined by comparing the obtained results with those derived using the Paris model.Results: Comparison of the crack growth determined using the feature-based model and Paris model as well as the measurement data indicated that the maximum and minimum error rates for the feature-based model were 0.67% and 0.08%, respectively.Conclusion: A model was developed to predict the crack length, which grows based on cycles. The feature-based model uses a small amount of data and can eliminate the uncertainty caused by the variability in the manufacturing of the materials."

The seismic isolators used in this analysis were the Friction Isolation Pendulum(FIP) and the Lead-Rubber Bearing (LRB). Each seismic isolator was modeled using a numerical analysis program. To consider the characteristics of the transformer, the model in the simulation was made similar to the actual shape of the transformer. To perform dynamic analysis, artificial seismic waves were generated and targeted onto the transformer by referring to the response spectrums for common applications from the seismic design standards and the ICC-ES AC156. In the dynamic analysis of the model, the FIP showed better results in terms of acceleration response than the LRB. Also, in the analysis, the LRB showed bigger rotational deformation as compared to the FIP. Therefore, appropriate countermeasures against the rotational deformation of the structure are required while installing the LRB."

Recently, natural language processing models using the Transformer structure have appeared, and Google's BERT is a representative example. Afterwards, various models came out by remodeling the BERT. Among them, the Facebook AI team unveiled the XLM-R (XLM-RoBERTa), an upgraded XLM model. XLM-R solved the data limitation and the curse of multilinguality by training XLM with 2TB or more refined CC (CommonCrawl), not Wikipedia data. This model showed that the multilingual model has similar performance to the single language model when it is trained by adjusting the size of the model and the data required for training. Therefore, in this paper, we study the improvement of Korean sentiment analysis performed using a pre-trained XLM-R model that solved curse of multilinguality and improved performance."

However, under the new Probation Reform Programme, Ministry of Justice of the UK (2021) published a “Unified Model” in February 2021, terminating the contracts with Community Rehabilitation Company (CRC) and bringing supervision and treatment of all offenders back to National Probation Service (NPS) from 28th June 2021. Furthermore, many studies identified that there were significant limitations in privatization in probation such as low levels of delivery, specifically in the private provider (CRC). In addition, the recent report by the Justice Committee (2021) argues that TR lacked sufficient planning or research into its impacts and capacity of private sector, pointing out that CRC has shown significant problems such as lower activity level and collapse of providers. Thus, this study examined the reasons of privatization in probation being ‘a failed social experiment’ (Cooper, 2021, p.46) and the limitations to overcome for the recent Re-unification model. The result of this study showed that there were significant problems in privatization in England and Wales: thin-supervision (Dominey, 2019) due to the ‘payment by result’ (HM Inspectorate of Probation, 2021, p.32), ‘damaged professionalism’ (Cooper, 2021, p.46), ineffectiveness for reducing recidivism and cost, and the systemic limitation in allocation of offenders between NPS and CRC. The findings in this study regarding limitations to be overcome by the Re-unified model are four major respects: (1) proactive cooperation with local professionals by ‘co-production’ (Tidmarsh and Marder, 2021, p.22) (2) ‘recapturing the re-professionalism’ for improving the quality of supervision (Tidmarsh and Marder, 2021, p.22), (3) decreasing heavy workload by increasing number of staff (4) imperfect re-unification in Electronic Monitoring. These results can lead to four policy implications for Korean probation such as enhancement of cooperative work with private providers, improving professionalism of probation officers, enhancement of workforce in staffing for ‘thick supervision’ (Dominey, 2019), developing the Korean probation model specifically in its advanced ICT technology and successful co-production with private professionals and providers. Taken together, although the failure in privation of English and Welsh model, it can be an asset as an empirical social experiment which provides evidence that privatization cannot be only solution for enhancement professionalism and cooperative work with private sectors in the criminal justice system. This study limited in lack of empirical evaluation of the result from the re-unification model and further studies into effectiveness of Dynamic Framework in cooperative work with private and voluntary sectors can ultimately lead to the greater improvement of Korean probation model."
초저출산율에 따른 시도별 출산율 변동을 반영한 예측 연구,2021,['Gompit'],,"This paper compares three statistical models that examine the relationship between national and provincespecific fertility rates. The three models are two of the regression models and a cointegration model. The regression model is by substituting Gompit transformation for the cumulative fertility rate by the average for ten years, and this model applies the raw data without transformation of the fertility data. A cointegration model can be considered when fitting the unstable time series of fertility rate in probability process. This paper proposes the following when it is intended to derive the relation of non-stationary fertility rate between the national and provinces. The cointegrated relationship between national and regional fertility rates is first derived. Furthermore, if this relationship is not significant, it is proposed to look at the national and regional fertility rate relationships with a regression model approach using raw data without transformation. Also, the regression model method of substituting Gompit transformation data resulted in an overestimation of fertility rates compared to other methods. Finally, Seoul, Busan, Daegu, Incheon, Gwangju, Daejeon and Gyeonggi province are expected to show a total fertility rate of 1.0 or less from 2025 to 2030, so an urgent and efficient policy to raise this level is needed."

English essay evaluation is inherently time-consuming. It may reflect teacher bias. English teachers are usually burdened with the task of evaluating many essays in a short period of time. Automated essay scoring (AES) can solve these problems. It has the advantage of being able to evaluate essays in a short time and without bias. In this paper, the RoBERT model was trained and evaluated on Essay Set #8 of the Automated Student Assessment Prize (ASAP) dataset. The 5-fold cross validation evaluation method was used for fair comparison with the previously suggested AES models. As a result, the RoBERT model showed the highest agreement with the human raters’ resolved scores in 5 out of 6 trait scores than the previous evaluation models. The advantage of it is that it can use the pre-trained BERT model and deal with long inputs, overcoming the input size limit of the BERT model. It was confirmed that the RoBERT model works well for trait-specific evaluation of long essays.

Compared to individual investor groups, professional investor groups such as foreign investors have an advantage in information and financial power and, as a result, foreign investors are known to show good investment performance among market participants.  The purpose of this study is to propose an investment strategy that combines investor-specific transaction information and machine learning, and to analyze the portfolio investment performance of the proposed model using actual stock price and investor-specific transaction data. The Korea Exchange offers daily information on the volume of purchase and sale of each investor to securities firms. We developed a data collection program in C# programming language using an API provided by Daishin Securities Cybosplus, and collected 151 out of 200 KOSPI stocks with daily opening price, closing price and investor-specific net purchase data from January 2, 2007 to July 31, 2017.  The self-organizing map model is an artificial neural network that performs clustering by unsupervised learning and has been introduced by Teuvo Kohonen since 1984. We implement competition among intra-surface artificial neurons, and all connections are non-recursive artificial neural networks that go from bottom to top. It can also be expanded to multiple layers, although many fault layers are commonly used. Linear functions are used by active functions of artificial nerve cells, and learning rules use Instar rules as well as general competitive learning. The core of the backpropagation model is the model that performs classification by supervised learning as an artificial neural network.  We grouped and transformed investor-specific transaction volume data to learn backpropagation models through the self-organizing map model of artificial neural networks. As a result of the estimation of verification data through training, the portfolios were rebalanced monthly. For performance analysis, a passive portfolio was designated and the KOSPI 200 and KOSPI index returns for proxies on market returns were also obtained.  Performance analysis was conducted using the equally-weighted portfolio return, compound interest rate, annual return, Maximum Draw Down, standard deviation, and Sharpe Ratio. Buy and hold returns of the top 10 market capitalization stocks are designated as a benchmark. Buy and hold strategy is the best strategy under the efficient market hypothesis. The prediction rate of learning data using backpropagation model was significantly high at 96.61%, while the prediction rate of verification data was also relatively high in the results of the 57.1% verification data. The performance evaluation of self-organizing map grouping can be determined as a result of a backpropagation model. This is because if the grouping results of the self-organizing map model had been poor, the learning results of the backpropagation model would have been poor. In this way, the performance assessment of machine learning is judged to be better learned than previous studies.  Our portfolio doubled the return on the benchmark and performed better than the market returns on the KOSPI and KOSPI 200 indexes. In contrast to the benchmark, the MDD and standard deviation for portfolio risk indicators also showed better results. The Sharpe Ratio performed higher than benchmarks and stock market indexes. Through this, we presented the direction of portfolio composition program using machine learning and investor-specific transaction information and showed that it can be used to develop programs for real stock investment.  The return is the result of monthly portfolio composition and asset rebalancing to the same proportion. Better outcomes are predicted when forming a monthly portfolio if the system is enforced by rebalancing the suggested stocks continuously without selling and re-buying it."

In general, model estimation is defined well when predictor variables are continuous. For nominal variables, dummy variable transformation is often employed; however, when the number of categories of response and predictor variables is large, the dimensionality is inflated dramatically and a singularity problem may occur because of unstable parameter estiomation. Various predictor variables may not be applicable for it. Therefore, alternative transformations are needed to utilize nominal variables efficiently. As an alternative, CRIMCOORD transformation is introduced and compared. As the result with train and test data partitions applied to classification analysis, CRIMCOORD remedies the problem of dummy variable transformation.

First, I would like to define what digital transformation is in the maritime transport sector. Second, it is intended to derive success factors for digital transformation in the maritime transportation field by examining various preceding studies related to digital transformation. Finally, in order to derive priorities for the derived success factors, an AHP analysis model is built and an expert survey is conducted for practical experts in the maritime transportation field. Based on the survey results, we would like to provide guidelines on what factors should be considered first among the success factors of digital transformation in the maritime transportation sector. In this study, in order to derive the priority of success factors for digital transformation in the maritime transportation field, the hierarchical structure was divided into four high-level evaluation items(strategic factors, organizational culture and human factors, technology factors, and environmental factors) and 21 sub-evaluation items. A relative evaluation method of weighting items among AHP(Analytic Hierarchy Process) was applied. AHP analysis of 24 questionnaires with a consistency ratio of 0.1 or less in order to increase the accuracy of information among questionnaires collected through maritime transportation related university professors, research groups, shipping companies, container terminals, and experts engaged in shipping related IT companies was carried out. As a result of the analysis, the priority of the first-tier factors for the success factors of digital transformation in the maritime transport sector was shown in the order of strategic factors, organizational culture and human factors, technology factors, and environmental factors.

Although this transitional situation acts as a positive function for individual national communities, it also causes dysfunction based on various social conflicts. This is because digital transformation is linked to structural social changes. However, in the current context, there is a limit to using the mechanism for managing and resolving social conflicts, which has been centered only on coordination between interests and interested parties, as it is. Therefore, this article examines measures to respond to social conflicts caused by digital transformation in the perspective of legislative studies. In conclusion, this article has constructed and proposed the following legislative working procedure model. (i) Institutionalization of impact assessment is necessary. (ii) Documented public comment procedures should be systematized throughout the entire legislative process and impact assessment process. (iii) It is necessary to build an opinion gathering and feedback platform for efficient public consultation. (iv) It is necessary to systematize the results of the government’s impact assessment, such as ‘conflict impact assessment’, to be used in the legislative process by submitting it to the National Assembly. (v) A system should be prepared in which the National Assembly can request a conflict impact assessment from the government(central administrative agencies). (vi) It is necessary to materialize the function of the government’s 4th Industrial Revolution Committee to deal with digital transformation and conflict issues effectively, and to prepare a system to link it with the legislative process of the National Assembly. Finally, (vii) in institutionalizing the impact assessment and public consultation procedures in all legislative areas, there may be limitations in the current size and scope of the National Assembly’s capacity, so it is possible to consider a method of piloting it at least in terms of ‘digital social conflict’."

Digital transformation has been actively carried out in finance, automobile manufacturing, and various services and has recently been promoted in the medical and welfare services sectors. This research examines the effect of wellness IT service characteristics using the value-based adoption model as the theoretical framework. The proposed research model is tested via a survey of 344 stakeholders of the long-term care facilities. Our study found that accuracy, safety, cleanness, and reliability were associated with perceived usefulness. On the contrary, they are not significantly associated with performance load. Perceived benefits positively affect the perceived value, but the perceived sacrifice does not significantly affect the perceived value. Finally, perceived value is strongly associated with customer satisfaction and intention to use the wellness IT service at long-term care facilities. This research suggests that service providers need to continuously evaluate and improve the perceived value to increase wellness information technology services. This research will help introduce wellness information technology in the long-term care facilities for the elderly, aiming for digital transformation."
Spectral relaxation computation of electroconductive nanofluid convection flow from a moving surface with radiative flux and magnetic induction,2021,"['magnetic nanofluid', 'induction', 'convection', 'radiation', 'moving sheet', 'Buongiorno model', 'nanoparticle diffusion', 'spectral relaxation method (SRM)', 'MATLAB']",,"A theoretical model is developed for steady magnetohydrodynamic viscous flow resulting from a moving semi-infinite flat plate in an electrically conducting nanofluid. Thermal radiation and magnetic induction effects are included in addition to thermal convective boundary conditions. Buongiorno’s two-component nanoscale model is deployed, which features Brownian motion and thermophoresis effects. The governing nonlinear boundary layer equations are converted to nonlinear ordinary differential equations by using suitable similarity transformations. The transformed system of differential equations is solved numerically, employing the spectral relaxation method (SRM) via the MATLAB R2018a software. SRM is a simple iteration scheme that does not require any evaluation of derivatives, perturbation, and linearization for solving a nonlinear system of equations. Effects of embedded parameters such as sheet velocity parameter$\lambda$, magnetic field parameter$\beta$, Prandtl number$Pr$, magnetic Prandtl number$Prm$, thermal radiation parameter$Rd$, Lewis number$Le$, Brownian motion parameter$Nb$, and thermophoresis parameter$Nt$ on velocity, induced magnetic field, temperature, and nanoparticle concentration profiles are investigated. The skin-friction results, local Nusselt number, and Sherwood number are also discussed for various values of governing physical parameters. To show the convergence rate against iteration, residual error analysis has also been performed. The flow is strongly decelerated, and magnetic induction is suppressed with greater magnetic body force parameter, whereas temperature is elevated due to extra work expended as heat in dragging the magnetic nanofluid. Temperatures are also boosted with increment in nanoscale thermophoresis parameter and radiative parameter, whereas they are reduced with higher wall velocity, Brownian motion, and Prandtl numbers. Both hydrodynamic and magnetic boundary layer thicknesses are reduced with greater reciprocal values of the magnetic Prandtl number Prm. Nanoparticle (concentration) boundary layer thickness is boosted with higher values of thermophoresis and Prandtl number, whereas it is diminished with increasing wall velocity, nanoscale Brownian motion parameter, radiative parameter, and Lewis number. The simulations are relevant to electroconductive nanomaterial processing."
Hyperparameter experiments on end-to-end automatic speech recognition,2021,"['automatic speech recognition', 'transformer', 'neural network', 'hyperparameters', 'optimization']",,"End-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) has achieved promising performance gains with the introduced self-attention network, Transformer. However, due to training time and the number of hyperparameters, finding the optimal hyperparameter set is computationally expensive. This paper investigates the impact of hyperparameters in the Transformer network to answer two questions: which hyperparameter plays a critical role in the task performance and training speed. The Transformer network for training has two encoder and decoder networks combined with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC). We have trained the model with Wall Street Journal (WSJ) SI-284 and tested on devl93 and eval92. Seventeen hyperparameters were selected from the ESPnet training configuration, and varying ranges of values were used for experiments. The result shows that “num blocks” and “linear units” hyperparameters in the encoder and decoder networks reduce Word Error Rate (WER) significantly. However, performance gain is more prominent when they are altered in the encoder network. Training duration also linearly increased as “num blocks” and “linear units” hyperparameters’ values grow. Based on the experimental results, we collected the optimal values from each hyperparameter and reduced the WER up to 2.9/1.9 from dev93 and eval93 respectively."

A total of 157 people were surveyed to analyze how the system properties of chatbots, such as response accuracy, social presence, risklessness, and other major variables in the technology acceptance model such as perceived usefulness, perceived ease, and perceived playfulness. The survey found that response accuracy, which means the extent to which chatbot services in the financial sector recognize users’ requests, plays a significant role in increasing perceived usefulness and perceived ease. The more accurately the chatbot service in the financial sector recognizes the users’ requests, the more users feel that the information provided by the chatbot service in the financial sector is not only useful but also easy to use. In addition, for banking services, chatbot’s response accuracy rate was particularly high. This suggests that bank chatbots, which are frequently asked about money transactions, should focus more on response accuracy. This study is expected to be used as a meaningful data to predict the use and spread of financial chatbot services, which are drawing attention in the rapidly changing era of digital transformation."

Therefore, in this paper, we present method to summarize the review with minimal loss of the topic. The proposed method classify reviews through processes such as preprocessing, importance evaluation, embedding substitution using BERT, and embedding clustering. Furthermore, the classified sentences generate the final summary using the trained Transformer summary model. The performance evaluation of the proposed model was compared by evaluating the existing summary model, seq2seq model, and the cosine similarity with the ROUGE score, and performed a high performance summary compared to the existing summary model."
An optimized machine learning based moment-rotation analysis of steel pallet rack connections,2021,"['connections', 'discrete wavelet transform', 'moment-rotation', 'steel pallet racks', 'support vector machine']",,"The moment-rotation (M-θ) response of steel pallet rack (SPR) beam-to-column connections (BCCs) is naturally complex and predicted through repeated experimental investigations motivated by the variety in the geometry of commercially available beam end connectors (BECs). Past literature has shown that even finite element modeling (FEM) was somehow unable to fully capture the structural behavior of SPR BCCs in the plastic region. This study proposes an innovative Support vector machine (SVM)-Discrete Wavelet transform (DWT)-based optimized model for M-θ analysis of SPR BCCs. A data set of total thirty-two experiments on SPR BCCs was used to develop the model. The experimental investigations identified the most influential parameters affecting the M-θ response of SPR BCCs which are column thickness, beam depth, and depth of the BEC. Those parameters were optimized using Firefly algorithm and selected as input parameters. Reliability assessment of proposed predictive model was performed using root-mean-square error (RMSE), Pearson coefficient (r), and coefficient of determination ‘r-square’ (R2). The findings of predictive model were juxtaposed with experimental outcomes and FEM results, available in the literature, and a close agreement was achieved. The R2 value of 0.958 and 0.984 were achieved for moment and rotation predictions, respectively. Hence, the proposed SVM-DWT model can be efficiently used to forecast the optimum and reliable M-θ response of SPR BCCs and to minimize the need of repetitive testing."

A Wind Estimation Based on Unscented Kalman Filter for Standoff Target Tracking Using a Fixed-Wing UAV,2021,"['Standoff tracking', 'Background wind', 'Unscented transformation', 'UKF']",,"To address standoff target tracking using a fixed-wing UAV in unknown background wind, a wind estimation based on Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is proposed. In the paper, UAV dynamic model and target state estimation are constructed, and Lyapunov vector field guidance (LVFG) framework is introduced to achieve standoff target tracking. The unknown target state and wind dynamic model have seldom been discussed for standoff tracking in the previous research. Therefore, two typical wind dynamic models with Dryden and Davenport spectrums are constructed for the target in the high altitude or near the ground. Then, the unscented transformation is adopted to estimate the position of UAV under guidance command generated by LVFG and saturation constraint. A wind state estimation method based on UKF is proposed to improve performance of standoff tracking. Simulated and realistic ground vehicle trajectories are used to demonstrate the availability and effectiveness of the proposed method for different wind dynamic models."

We discuss the essential steps for creating an intelligent agent that can automatically perceive the design environment (perception) and produce design ideas (action). In the first step, we use photographs or video images to model three-dimensional coordinates and exact positions of surface points on objects inside the interior space. We then convert the collected spatial data to a set or cloud of points. To fully model the interior space, we create either a triangulated surface or a mesh from the points and then transform it into a detailed building information model (BIM). Last, we apply texture data to either the 3D surface/mesh or the building information model. In the second step, we develop a sequential decision-making model based on Markov decision process for the intelligent agent to make design decisions in the BIM environment. We apply the proposed workflow to a case study with 512 possible design options, conduct experiments with 20 participants where design decisions are made based on AI insights, and perform statistical analysis on the experiment results. Our findings show the proposed workflow is capable of improving participants’ satisfaction by only searching through on average 5.1% of all possible design options.

DC series arc diagnosis based on deep‑learning algorithm with frequency‑domain characteristics,2021,"['DC series arc', 'Frequency domain', 'Fast Fourier transform (FFT)', 'Deep neural network (DNN)']",,"A series arc produces both light and heat, which results in a risk of fire. Hence, its prompt detection is very important. The series arc has different frequency characteristics depending on the operating conditions of the inverter and the line impedance. As a result, it is difficult to detect with conventional methods that use specific frequency bands. In this study, series arcs generated by three-phase pulse-width-modulated and three-phase model-predictive-control inverter loads, operating under various conditions, were detected using a deep-learning algorithm. To detect a series arc fault, the frequency characteristics were analyzed using all the frequency bands of a fast Fourier transform (FFT) result. To use all the frequency bands, a deep neural network (DNN), which is a deep-learning algorithm, was used. DNNs can learn quickly from large amounts of data and model complex nonlinear relationships. The DNN model proposed in this paper was designed to use all the frequency bands, and three cases were tested by changing the current magnitude and switching frequency. The arc current detection accuracy was calculated for three test cases and the obtained results were analyzed in detail based on the percentages of true/false and mean absolute error metrics.

Moreover, open phase faults are difficult to detect because the open phase voltage of the existing protection relay (Open Phase Relay (47)) can be maintained, even though a disconnection fault occurred, depending on the wiring method and the iron core type of the grid-connected transformer for a PV system. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel algorithm to detect open phase faults by comparing the currents and phases between the primary and secondary sides of a grid-connected transformer. In addition, this paper presents the modeling of a distribution system and protection devices for detecting open phase faults using PSCAD/EMTDC S/W, and implements a test protection device for detecting open phase faults based on the above-mentioned modeling. The simulation and test results confirmed that the proposed algorithm is useful for detecting open phase faults according to the wiring method and iron core type of grid-connected transformer for a PV system because operation slope and unbalance rate of the primary current exceed the setting value (30[%]) of the protection device."

Two variables like parents’ total income and the education fee for private education were used for the economic capital, and the variables such as the communication with parents, emotional help, academic help were for the social capital in the family. The variable of the social capital outside the family included students’ class attitude, communication with teachers, the relationship with classmates, etc. This study provided a research model to get the answer for the research questions and, using the latent growth model, analyzed the initial value and slope of the 3 years longitudinal data as the time went. The result was that both parents’ total income and private education for the economic capital had an influence on the students’ English achievement, but not on their social capital. The fee for private education of the both variables only impacted the social capital. The social capital in the family affected the social capital outside the family in the research model. The social capital in the family had a negative effect on students’ English achievement, but the social capital outside the family influenced positively on it. In conclusion, the fee for the private education among parents’ economic capital not only affected students’ English achievement, but also was changed into their social capital, which made a difference in their English ability."

In particular, attempts are being made to further pre-train domain information or target data using masked language model (MLM), which is one of the BERT training methods. However, if further pre-training is performed with the existing random masking when performing sentiment classification, there is a limitation that sentimental nuance for the entire sentence may not be sufficiently learned if the words that are important clues to the sentiment classification are masked. Therefore, in this study, we propose an further pre-training method specialized for sentiment classification tasks which sufficiently reflect sentiment information in sentences by selective masking that excludes clue words from masking candidates. In addition, this study proposes a method to distinguish between clue words and surrounding words as the role of words by utilizing the attention mechanism. On inferring sentence vectors by applying the proposed methodology to actual sentiment comments and performing sentiment classification experiments, it was confirmed that the proposed methodology showed superior performance in terms of classification accuracy compared to several existing comparison models."

As a result, one’s perception of transformational leadership had a positive effect, whereas, among employment characteristics, employment type and working hours had negative effects on quality of service. Regular workers with fewer working hours and higher awareness of transformational leadership toward the director provided higher quality of service. But wage, total experience and tenure didn't meaningfully affect it. Therefore, the following suggestions were presented. First, it is necessary to reorganize incentive, salary systems and budgets, changing the status of temporary workers' hourly wage system into that of regular workers’ monthly one in order to strengthen employment security with acknowledging fundamental professional values through reinforcement of expertise. Reinforcement of long-term care’s publicness and establishment of base facilities are also suggested. Second, maintaining appropriate hours of work and rest including annual leave under the Labor Standards Act is needed. Also, increasing the salary of and decreasing working hours for night shift workers are required.

Few-Shot Image Synthesis using Noise-Based Deep Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets,2021,"['font', 'font styles', 'computer vision', 'image generation', 'generative adversarial networks']",,"In recent years research on automatic font generation with machine learning mainly focus on using transformation-based methods, in comparison, generative model-based methods of font generation have received less attention. Transformation-based methods learn a mapping of the transformations from an existing input to a target. This makes them ambiguous because in some cases a single input reference may correspond to multiple possible outputs. In this work, we focus on font generation using the generative model-based methods which learn the buildup of the characters from noise-to-image. We propose a novel way to train a conditional generative deep neural model so that we can achieve font style control on the generated font images. Our research demonstrates how to generate new font images conditioned on both character class labels and character style labels when using the generative model-based methods. We achieve this by introducing a modified generator network which is given inputs noise, character class, and style, which help us to calculate losses separately for the character class labels and character style labels. We show that adding the character style vector on top of the character class vector separately gives the model rich information about the font and enables us to explicitly specify not only the character class but also the character style that we want the model to generate."

The proposed system is a system which uses conformer instead of transformer with transformer-based language model. When Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI) speech corpus in AI-Hub is used for our evaluation, the proposed system yields 5.7 % of Character Error Rate (CER) while the baseline system results in 11.8 % of CER. Even though speech corpus is extended into other domain of AI-hub such as NHNdiguest speech corpus, the proposed system makes a robust performance for two domains.

In this study, the method of using the discrete wavelet transform is introduced to the classification problem of time series data and applied to actual data analysis. Discrete wavelet transform is an advanced form of Fourier analysis that does not contain time information, and has the advantage of simultaneously increasing temporal resolution and frequency resolution, so it is effective in the classification problem of non-stationary time series data. Decision tree, naive Bayesian, k-NN, SVM, and random forest methods were used as classification models. And various measures, which include accuracy, kappa coefficient, F1-score, ARI, were used for performance comparison. As a result of applying these methods to time series data observing concentration of hydrochloric acid, it was confirmed that the method using discrete wavelets analysis performed better than the result of applying the classification model directly to the raw data or the result using the Fourier transform (or short time Fourier transform).

However, since the 2000s, as the economy has grown rapidly and its global influence has greatly expanded, China has actively sought to establish its own education model, moving away from following the overseas education model. It has shifted its focus from referencing and imitating the curriculum of major U.S. universities to emphasizing China’s tradition of thought and civilization, and strengthened the education of Chinese-style socialist ideology. In this process, “Tongshijiaoyu” was upgraded as a major means of national unity and establishing a Chinese-style socialist identity.  After the return of Hong Kong in 1997, China expected education to play an active role in quickly transforming Hong Kong into a Chinese identity. It was believed that “Tongshijiaoyu” could transform Hong Kong students into Chinese in name and reality, just as it fostered continental students into human types that Chinese socialism aims for. The reality, however, was contrary to the Chinese government’s expectations. Hong Kong’s “Tongshijiaoyu” has become an incubator that fosters Hong Kong students with the identity of Hong Kong people who refuse to assimilate to China. This was very embarrassing for China. In the end, China has taken a contradictory stance of actively supporting and developing “Tongshijiaoyu” on the continent, while Hong Kong is criticizing, reducing, or trying to oust it.  The content of this study consists of two parts. The first is to understand the progress and current situation of Chinese “Tongshijiaoyu”. It is helpful to understand the macroscopic direction in which Chinese society is moving by examining the background in which Chinese “Tongshijiaoyu” emerged, in what context it was valued and developed, and in what status it currently exists. Second, it is to see how China’s pursuit of “Tongshijiaoyu(liberal studies)” has ultimately failed in Hong Kong, unlike the continent. Understanding the current state of “Tongshijiaoyu(liberal studies)” in Hong Kong, the relationship between Hong Kong “Tongshijiaoyu(liberal studies)” and anti-Chinese protests, and how China responds to Hong Kong education issues is necessary to understand China’s foreign policy."
유사도 기반 이미지 캡션을 이용한 시각질의응답 연구,2021,[],,"Visual Question Answering (VQA) and image captioning are tasks that require understanding of the features of images and linguistic features of text. Therefore, co-attention may be the key to both tasks, which can connect image and text. In this paper, we propose a model to achieve high performance for VQA by image caption generated using a pretrained standard transformer model based on MSCOCO dataset. Captions unrelated to the question can rather interfere with answering, so some captions similar to the question were selected to use based on a similarity to the question. In addition, stopwords in the caption could not affect or interfere with answering, so the experiment was conducted after removing stopwords. Experiments were conducted on VQA-v2 data to compare the proposed model with the deep modular co-attention network (MCAN) model, which showed good performance by using co-attention between images and text. As a result, the proposed model outperformed the MCAN model."

Derived activated carbon was applied for removal of fluoride from aqueous solution. The MPPAC-500 was characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), zeta potential, X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Particle Size Analyser. The fluoride sequestration study was performed in both batch and column systems. The batch adsorption study was focused on parameter like, adsorbent dose, contact time, pH and initial fluoride concentrations. The maximum capacity of fluoride removal was qo = 4.71 (㎎/g). Freundlich isotherm model (R²-0.995) obeyed better than Langmuir (R²-0.979) model. The RL values observed between 0-1 (RL-0.057) inferred the favourable adsorption. Pseudo-second-order model favoured well than pseudo-first-order in the whole experimental data. In case of column study was performed at two different bed height 5 ㎝ and 10 ㎝ having flow rate of 5 mL/min as well as 10 mL/min. The breakthrough curve and column data were interpreted by Thomas, Adams-Bohart, Yoon-Nelson and Clark model. These finding showed that MPPAC-500 has potential adsorptive capacity for fluoride removal from aqueous solutions in batch and column systems."

In addition to providing powerful protection for patents, there should be sufficient channels to utilize patent rights, both in terms of scientific and technological output and value transformation. Overall, this is necessary to realize the social and economic benefits of patent rights and simulate the driving force of innovation and expand the power source of creativity. Patent securitization is an innovative approach to transform the value of patent rights. In particular, as a financial way to effectively promote the transformation of scientific and technological achievements, patent securitization has unique advantages in promoting science and technology-linked financial system. In the past two decades, under the guidance of Chinese policies and regarding the experience and practice of securitization in developed countries, several patent securitization models have been effectively spawned.  Based on the first patent-only securitization pilot case in China, we try to explore the feasibility of legislation for securitization of patents through the patent licensing authorization model. Under the perfect policy system and institutional arrangement, patent securitization has the following important significance: it can improve the efficiency of the value of enterprise patent assets, broaden the enterprise financing channels, realize the diversification and convenience of enterprise financing, and ease the financing pressure. According to the discussion of the first patent-only securitization pilot case in China, the article concludes that if China have sufficient patent assets and perform adequate risk evaluation, and to have a perfect policy system and the legal system as a guarantee, and the legislation of patent securitization can be carried out in the model of patent licensing authorization."
Nonlinear Inversion Using Very Fast Simulated Annealing for Horizontal Electric Dipole Time-Domain Electromagnetic Data,2021,"['Global Optimization Inversion', 'Horizontal Electric Dipole', 'Time-Domain Electromagnetic', 'Resistivity', 'Very Fast Simulated Annealing.']",,"A nonlinear stochastic inversion scheme, called very fast simulated annealing (VFSA), was applied to the time-domain electromagnetic data generated from a horizontal electric dipole. The forward formulation of the vertical magnetic field was expressed in the Laplace domain by applying the Hankel integral transform. Time-domain transformation was performed by applying the inverse Laplace transform using the Gaver–Stehfest algorithm. In this study, for noise-free synthetic data, the VFSA scheme yielded the smallest misfit and an inverted resistivity model that resembled the test model. The addition of 5% random noise to the synthetic data produced the same level of misfit and a model that still mimicked the test model. However, the addition of 10% noise to the synthetic data resulted in a misfit value that was three times that of the first two values and a resistivity model with a large discrepancy with the test model, particularly at large depths.These results indicate the efficacy of the VFSA inversion scheme for inferring the subsurface resistivity structure from the electromagnetic data. This inversion scheme was applied to field data measured in a volcanic environment. The general pattern of the resistivity structure inferred by the VFSA inversion is consistent with the structure obtained previously by using a deterministic inversion scheme."
Interreligous I-Thou Encounter,2021,"['Interreligious', 'Martin Buber', 'Countertransference', 'Mutuality', 'Self-Differentiation']",,"The lack of communication with the wider social context and the persistent problem of one-sided communication are the challenges facing the church today. To borrow Pual Knitter’s words, this problem may lie on the fact that Korean Christianity is built on the total replacement model. Within this frame of mind, Christians listen to religious others only to replace them with Christianity. However, when we take globalization into our consideration, Korean churches need to be equipped for the new landscape in which their potential congregants live. More religious as well as cultural diversity exists today in South Korea than a generation ago. The possibility of encountering religious others as clients is wide open. When I take globalization into consideration, it becomes a more mind-boggling question as to how I can initiate I-Thou relationships with religious others. In this study, I will look into some ways to bring about transformation within the context of interreligious care and counseling based on my personal experience. What I want to accomplish through this study is to explore ways for spiritual care and counseling to be transformative, particularly in an interreligious care and counseling setting. I attempt to investigate the usefulness of the RCT model for interreligious spiritual care and counseling settings in light of the wisdom of scholars’ endeavors in interreligious dialogue. I am drawn to the RCT model as opposed to traditional Freudian theory, especially for the interreligious care and counseling setting. Here, I would like to expound how the RCT model puts an emphasis on mutuality between counselors and counselees by reconceptualizing the meaning of countertransference. Mutuality within the RCT model will be discussed with Martin Buber’s I-Thou framwork and John Gottman’s relationship theory. In addition, I will look into the necessity of interreligious counselors and those they counsel developing a differentiated self. I wish we Christian counselors and ministers could value and further celebrate the otherness of religious others in our care settings. Then, spiritual care and counseling could be life-giving and transformative."

CNPs were produced through the cross bond with tripolyphosphate (TPP), and L. lac.-CNPs were prepared through the introduction of L. lac. during the preparation. The various functional groups of all adsorbents were identified using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Adsorption isotherm and adsorption kinetic confirmed the adsorption behavior and mechanism of CNPs, L. lac. and L. lac.-CNPs. The adsorption behavior of DBP and DEP for all particles was more suitable for the Freundlich adsorption isotherm model than for the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model, which means that the surface of the particles is heterogeneous. The adsorption mechanism was more suitable for the Pseudo-2<sup>nd</sup>-order model than for the Pseudo-1<sup>st</sup>-order model. This means that due to the presence of various functional groups on the particle surface, the adsorption of DBP and DEP is dominated by chemical adsorption such as electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding rather than physical adsorption. Finally, it was confirmed that the preparation of CNPs and L. lac.-CNPs can be performed easily and quickly, and it could be used as a cheaper adsorbent that can effectively remove phthalates."

This can be said to be the beginning of e-mail marketing. Since then, Internet users have exploded due to the global spread of the Internet and the development of the mobile market. Finally, the era of one mail per person has arrived, and the proportion of spam mail also increases. As fatigue gradually accumulates, a method for coping with advertisements and spam mail received through various media is being developed. However, if you analyze the graph of the “Spam Receipt Survey” of the Korea Internet & Security Agency, the growth rate of spam emails is gradually decreasing. In addition, the existing spam email model is being eliminated and transformed into a new subscription-based business model. According to Zuora’s Subscription Economy Index, the subscription economy index has grown more than six times (435%) over the past nine years. This has further developed the subscription business model with the emergence of the MZ generation, which hopes to select only the necessary information amid changes in consumer culture and flood of information due to low economic growth, which can be reconsidered as customer-centered content. The purpose of this study is to analyze the factors that have developed into differentiated content that delivers information as e-mail newsletters switch to a new business model, focusing on the relationship between emotional experience services and content. By studying domestic and foreign cases of subscription e-mail newsletters, the actual e-mail newsletters’ content type, service type, design analysis by brand, content production process and customer interaction were analyzed. As a result of the analysis, it is analyzed that subscription e-mail newsletter contents should be provided in consideration of subscribers’ tendencies and emotions in order to provide differentiated emotional experience services for subscribers. The email subscription service, which can lead to customer satisfaction as an emotional experience service, is no longer recognizing spam, but settling into an area of content. This study is expected to be used as data for research on the current status of e-mail newsletters based on subscription services."

At present, relying entirely on experience or process trial-anderrormethod, it can not effectively reveal the transient mechanism of laser quenching of disk laser, which is not conduciveto shortening the research and development cycle and saving costs. The numerical simulation provides an effective way toobtain the dynamic evolution law of multi-field coupling in laser quenching process. In this paper, a thermo-mechanicalcoupling model of ASTM 1045 laser quenching process by disk laser is established. In the model, the temperature-dependentphysical parameters were calculated by CALPHAD method. The transient law of temperature and microstructural transformationduring quenching was obtained by solving the model. The formation and transformation degree of martensite werecharacterized by the dynamic changes of the depth and width of quenched transformation layer. The quenching structure andtransformation hardening law were observed by Axioskop 2 SEM and Zeiss-IGMA HD FE-SEM to verify the accuracy ofthe simulation results. On this basis, the process parameters of laser quenching were sampled by Monte-Carlo method basedon response surface methodology. The sensitivity effects of different process parameters on the temperature field and phasechange field of laser quenching were analyzed, which laid a theoretical foundation for the optimization of process parameters."
Research on rapid source term estimation in nuclear accident emergency decision for pressurized water reactor based on Bayesian network,2021,"['Pressurized water reactor', 'Nuclear emergency decision making', 'Source term estimation', 'Probabilistic risk assessment', 'Bayesian network']",,"Nuclear emergency preparedness and response is an essential part to ensure the safety of nuclear power plant (NPP). Key support technologies of nuclear emergency decision-making usually consist of accident diagnosis, source term estimation, accident consequence assessment, and protective action recommendation. Source term estimation is almost the most difficult part among them. For example, bad communication, incomplete information, as well as complicated accident scenario make it hard to determine the reactor status and estimate the source term timely in the Fukushima accident. Subsequently, it leads to the hard decision on how to take appropriate emergency response actions. Hence, this paper aims to develop a method for rapid source term estimation to support nuclear emergency decision making in pressurized water reactor NPP. The method aims to make our knowledge on NPP provide better support nuclear emergency. Firstly, this paper studies how to build a Bayesian network model for the NPP based on professional knowledge and engineering knowledge. This paper presents a method transforming the PRA model (event trees and fault trees) into a corresponding Bayesian network model. To solve the problem that some physical phenomena which are modeled as pivotal events in level 2 PRA, cannot find sensors associated directly with their occurrence, a weighted assignment approach based on expert assessment is proposed in this paper. Secondly, the monitoring data of NPP are provided to the Bayesian network model, the real-time status of pivotal events and initiating events can be determined based on the junction tree algorithm. Thirdly, since PRA knowledge can link the accident sequences to the possible release categories, the proposed method is capable to find the most likely release category for the candidate accidents scenarios, namely the source term. The probabilities of possible accident sequences and the source term are calculated. Finally, the prototype software is checked against several sets of accident scenario data which are generated by the simulator of AP1000-NPP, including large loss of coolant accident, loss of main feedwater, main steam line break, and steam generator tube rupture. The results show that the proposed method for rapid source term estimation under nuclear emergency decision making is promising."
Study of Nonlinear Fuzzy Integro-differential Equations Using Mathematical Methods and Applications,2021,"['Sumudu transform', 'Homotopy perturbation method', 'Non linear fuzzy integro-differential equation', 'Fuzzy solution']",,"In this study, the homotopy perturbation sumudu transform method (HPSTM) is employed to find the analytical fuzzy solution of nonlinear fuzzy integro-differential equations (FIDEs). The solutions of FIDEs are more generalized and have better applications. The fuzzy concept is used to overrule the uncertainty in physical models. Based on the parametric form of the fuzzy number, the nonlinear integro-differential equation (IDE) is converted into two systems of nonlinear IDEs of the second kind. Some numerical examples were solved to demonstrate the efficiency and capability of the method. Graphical representations reveal the symmetry between lower and upper cut representations of fuzzy solutions and may be helpful for a better understanding of fuzzy control models, artificial intelligence, medical science, quantum optics, measure theory, and so on."

Outside barrier lookback options with floating strike,2021,"['Barrier option', 'Esscher transform', 'Lookback option', 'Lookback outside barrier options']",,"This paper introduces a new class of exotic options, lookback outside barrier options with two underlying assets, which combine lookback and barrier options by incorporating active barrier conditions into lookback payoff. Bermin (Essays on lookback and barrier options: A Malliavin calculus approachs, Lund University, Department of Economics, PhD thesis, 1998) proposed lookback-barrier options to compensate for the shortcomings of the high-priced lookback option, and later several applications were made by either mitigating the conditions or adding other conditions. In this paper, we extend the existing idea to lookback-barrier options with two underlying assets. To reduce the burden of the computational process and simplify the conditions, the life of the options was divided into two non-overlapping intervals. The structure of the lookback outside barrier option with two underlying assets is as follows: whether the barrier conditions are satisfied or not in the first subinterval, and the amount of payoff is determined in the second subinterval if the condition is met. In traditional lookback-barrier options, barrier conditions and payoff are determined by one asset, while in a lookback-barrier option with two underlying assets, one of the two assets determines the barrier conditions and the other is responsible for payoff. Our main study develops a complete valuation framework that allows for closed-form pricing formulas under the Black-Scholes model. This closed pricing formula for lookback outside barrier option with two underlying assets offers significant advantages over Monte Carlo simulation methods, as a large number of simulations may be required for accurate computation. Complexities involved in the derivation process would be resolved by the Esscher transform and the reflection principle of Brownian motion. We illustrate our results with numerical examples, showing the effects of different values of correlation coefficients between two underlying asset prices."

The idea of self-propelled gyrotactic microorganisms is implemented to stabilize the suspended nanoparticles in Williamson liquid. Darcy-Forchheimer together with porosity effects are accounted in the flow. Energy relation is modeled in view of thermal radiation, variable thermal conductivity and Joule heating. Activation energy linked with chemical reaction is executed at the surface. Furthermore, Brownian dispersion and thermophoresis effects are also considered. Flow governing dimensional model is acquired using boundary layer suppositions. Suitable transformations are used to alter the system of PDE’s into non-dimensional. NDSolve code in Mathematica package is utilized to solve the model. Impacts of various flow regulating variables on velocity, temperature, mass concentration and motile density are investigated by plotting. Coefficient of skin friction, Sherwood number, motile density number and heat transfer rate are tabulated and analyzed. It is observed that velocity field decays while temperature field enhances versus rising dimensionless magnetic parameter. Moreover, due to magnetic field more Lorentz force is applied to the flow as a result surface drag force enhances while heat transfer rate decays."
MIMO 시스템을 위한 QR 분해 기반 MMSE 반복 등화기,2021,"['MIMO', 'MMSE', 'Iterative Equalizer', 'QR Decomposition', 'Linear Transformation']",,"In this letter, we propose an MMSE iterative equalizer based on QR decomposition for MIMO systems. To reduce the complexity of existing MMSE iterative equalizer, the proposed scheme generates a new system model through linear transformation by a unitary matrix obtained from QR decomposition of the original channel matrix, and then performs the MMSE iterative equalization procedure based on the new system model. Because the effective channel matrix is an upper-triangular matrix whose size is determined by the number of transmit antennas, the proposed scheme can expect more complexity savings for the MMSE filter matrix calculation as the number of received antennas increases. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves the identical BER performance to the conventional MMSE iterative equalizer regardless of the numbers of transmit and receive antennas."

Correction of Time and Coordinate Systems for Interoperability of Multi-GNSS,2021,"['GNSS', 'multi-GNSS interoperability', 'Helmert transformation', 'precise ephemeris']",,"GNSS receivers capable of tracking multiple Global Navigation Systems (GNSSs) simultaneously are widely used. In order to estimate accurate user position and velocity, it is necessary to consider the key elements that contribute to the interoperability of the different GNSSs. Typical examples are the time system and the coordinate system. Each GNSS is operated based on its own reference time system depending on when the system was developed and whether the leap seconds are applied. In addition, each GNSS is designed based on its own coordinate system based on earth model constant values. This paper addresses the interoperability issues from the viewpoint of Single Point Positioning (SPP) users utilizing multiple GNSS signals from GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, and Galileo. Since the broadcast ephemerides of each GNSS are based on their own time and coordinate systems, the time and the coordinate systems should be unified for any user algorithm. For this purpose, this paper proposes a method of converting each GNSS coordinate system into the reference coordinate system through Helmert transformation. The error of the broadcast ephemerides was calculated with the precise ephemerides provided by the International GNSS Service (IGS). The effectiveness of the proposed multi-GNSS correction and transformation method is verified using the Multi-GNSS Experiment (MGEX) station data."

In addition, the progress of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, represented by intelligence, and the forced introduction of non-face-to-face due to Covid-19 are accelerating the application of ICT applied services to existing offline industries. In particular, museums that will be mainly covered in this study have become places of avoidance due to shutdowns or social distancing. In addition, at the end of the dark tunnel, the era of New-Normal where digital has become commonplace will be in an environment where visitors cannot be treated in the same way as before. These changes are not sudden, but continuous flows, and the introduction speed has only been accelerated due to Covid-19. Therefore, it is essential for museums to provide realistic exhibitions, communication with visitors, and fun factors to enhance visitor satisfaction and revisit by introducing online services. In this study, some methods are proposed to increase the interest and satisfaction of visitors by developing and proposing a technology that provides online experience factors related to exhibition artworks in real time by applying NST, a method of deep learning of an image conversion network using content image and style image as inputs based on a pre-trained model."

As a practical way to reduce the dimensionality of the LIDAR point cloud data and to extract an important target feature from it, the Hough transform is applied and the corresponding measurement equation is modeled. It is well-known that the pattern of the LIDAR point cloud varies with the relative geometry due to occlusion, which may leads the severe performance degradation in target tracking. To cope with this problem, a multiple model filter is designed by considering the measurement acquisition hypotheses on the target feature. Through the experiments in real-driving condition, the superior performance of the proposed filter over the existing method is demonstrated."

This nature of the job has always required intricate systems manufactured using an expensive set of sensors and components. In this paper, we propose a system to draw the trajectory of a golf ball during a drive. The proposed system combines the classical computer vision techniques and a modern deep neural network to project the trajectories over videos taken from monocular cameras. Before starting to track the ball, the system uses YOLO(You Only Look Once) V3, deep neural network model to perform localization of the golf ball and the player. To track the initial point of impact between the club and the ball the system uses Hough transform. Finally to track the ball, the system extracts motion information of the video by using frame differencing. Unto the information received from frame differencing, the system applies filters based on a few assumptions, size and direction of movement to obtain the detections of the golf ball. The proposed system was tested on a multitude of videos to verify its effectiveness and the respective results are presented."

DS의 유용성은 다양한 대용량 데이터를 활용한 의사 결정 방법의 개선 여부에 따라 결정되며, 데이터 사이언티스트(Data Scientists; 이하 DSt)는 복잡한 구조와 상호 작용을 갖는 수많은 변수들로 구성된 데이터로부터 해석 가능한 패턴과 명확한 규칙(들)을 도출하여 조직 내 의사 결정을 도울 수 있어야 한다. 하지만, 각 기업의 중요 사업 영역/활동에 적합한 DSt를 외부로부터 지속적으로 고용하는 것은 물리적으로 한계가 있으며, 데이터에 기초한 과학적 의사 결정 문화의 정착을 기대하는 기업들에게 바람직하지 않다. 왜냐하면, 기업의 올바른 의사 결정은 사업 환경의 이해 그리고 관련 분야에서의 경험과 지식을 전제로 가능하기 때문이다. 따라서 꼭 필요한 전문가의 외부 고용과 함께 기업의 사업 환경과 업무 영역에 대한 경험이 풍부하고 데이터의 의미와 의사 결정의 중요성을 이해하는 내부 구성원들을 대상으로 기업 내 DSt를 체계적으로 양성하는 것이 대안일 수 있다. 본 논문에서는 통계학의 파생 관점에서 DS 교육 과정을 설명하고 기업 내 DSt의 역량 범위를 기준으로 훈련 과정에서 필수적으로 반영해야 할 핵심 주제들과 비중 그리고 사내 전개 시 주의 사항을 논의한다. 또한 데이터 분석의 기본이 되는 통계적 학습과 기계적 학습간의 실무적 차이점을 설명하고, 시각화와 모형화 관점에서의 핵심 개념과 도구를 소개한다. 또한 DS를 적용하는 기업에서 발생할 수 있는 일반적인 실행 오류를 제시하고 이를 방지하기 위한 지침을 제시한다.","Introduced in the 1990s, Data Science(hereinafter referred to as DS) is a new topic for companies along with Digital Transformation(hereinafter referred to as DX). This is a natural phenomenon as the usefulness and utilization of large-capacity data increases due to the development of a systematic analysis method for Big Data and social changes such as the development of IT and DB-related technologies, the emergence of social media based on the mobile environment. The usefulness of DS depends on whether the decision-making method using a variety of large amounts of data is improved and Data Scientists(hereinafter referred to as DSt) should be able to help decision-making within the organization by deriving interpretable patterns and clear rule(s) from data composed of numerous variables with complex structures and interactions. However, there is a physical limit to continuously hiring a DSt suitable for each company s important business area/activity from outside and it is undesirable for companies that expect to establish a data-based scientific decision-making culture. This is because the correct decision-making of a company is possible based on an understanding of the business environment with experience and knowledge in related fields. Therefore, it may be an alternative to systematically training DSt within the company for internal members who have extensive experience in the company s business environment and work area, and who understand the meaning of data and the importance of decision-making, along with external hiring of essential experts. In this paper, the DS training process is explained from the perspective of derivation of statistics, and the core topics and weights that must be reflected in the training process based on the competency range of DSt within the company are discussed, and precautions when developing in-house. It also explains the practical differences between statistical learning and mechanical learning, which are the basis of data analysis, and introduces key concepts and tools from the perspective of visualization and modeling.

It considers fable novels in the late Joseon era as the subjects, and examines the nature of the knowledge in them. As a result, it finds that while theoretical and cultural knowledge were mainly utilized, folk and practical knowledge were also mixed, which may be related to the trend of the knowledge at that time.Subsequently, this study examines the aspects of discourse utilization of knowledge contained in Dukkeopjeon, Tokkijeon, Jangkkijeon, and Seodongjijeon. The results are as follows. First, aspects of utilization increased persuasion by bringing the knowledge appropriate to the situation in the historical events, ancient events, and Sino-Korean poetry in China, and by relying on its authority, to find a way to raise the dignity of the author or speaker. Moreover, the speaker would utilize knowledge to show off, and by presenting an interpretation context that differs from conventional interpretations, it is found that they would find a way to relate the ""typical model"" and to distort and use knowledge to their advantage. It is also shown that the utilization aspect of story-telling is of interest to readers. Through these aspects of utilization, with the double consciousness of traditional knowledge, which has been undermined as a bygone absolute ""typical example"" by the weakening of the reality response, there is a feeling that the atmosphere reserves new discourse power by reconstructing existing knowledge.Then, this article examines how fable novels created around the time of modernization - namely, the aspects of utilization of knowledge discourse which were examined earlier - appear in the Geumsuhoeeuirok and the Geumsujaepan. It detects, in these two works, an aspect of utilization similar to the previous ones, which means that their narrative lies in the continuous line of fable novels in the late Joseon era. However, this study finds some differences, such as that it accepts Western knowledge, has knowledge of the Bible and ecology of animals, the attitude of the speaker or delineator in utilizing discourses is as serious as the situation in which the speech or controversy occurs or the severity of the subject matter, and that the speaker's self-exaggerated knowledge utilization and fun-oriented aspects are often not visible. Thus, both works show that the rhetorical tradition of utilizing the knowledge discourse of fable novels is combined with the enlightening consciousness of early modern knowledge."
Road Type Identification Ahead of the Tire Using D-CNN and Reflected Ultrasonic Signals,2021,"['Ultrasonic sensor', 'Road type identification', 'Friction coefficient', 'Short-time Fourier transform', 'Machinelearning', 'Deep convolutional neural network']",,"Every land moving object accelerates or decelerates based on the frictional coefficient of the road surface. It has been known that this coefficient on the road is determined by the type of road surface. In this work, we propose a simplistic, machine-learning based solution to estimate the road type using the reflected ultrasonic signals paired with ultrasonic transmitter and receiver. Since the reflected signal contains the material information of the surface due to the difference in the surface roughness and acoustic impedance, different characteristics can be observed for each frequency of the reflected signal. To exploit such characteristics, the signals are transformed into the frequency domain using short-time Fourier transform. In addition, a deep convolutional neural network is applied as the road identifier due to its well-known representational power. In order to verify the aforementioned ideas, the ample database consisting of eight types of road surfaces are obtained with the ultrasonic sensors. And then, the database is used to train the model, as well as to evaluate the accuracy of the trained model. It can be seen that the proposed method makes it easier and more accurate to identify the type of road surface than the conventional methods."

By changing the level and order of various MW (Mother Wavelets) using the current collected in the existing pulse injection method, the optimal MW for ground fault detection method is derived. First, an ungrounded LVDC Microgrid is modeled using PSCAD s/w, and ground faults are simulated by varying the fault point and fault resistance.

CD1d deficiency limits tolerogenic properties of peritoneal macrophages,2021,"['CD1d', 'CIA', 'NKT cells', 'Peritoneal macrophage', 'Rheumatoid arthritis']",,"Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are involved in various autoimmune diseases. Although iNKT cells are arthritogenic, transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ)-treated tolerogenic peritoneal macrophages (Tol-pMψ) from wild-type (WT) mice are more tolerogenic than those from CD1d knock-out iNKT cell-deficient mice in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model. The underlying mechanism by which pMφ can act as tolerogenic antigen presenting cells (APCs) is currently unclear. To determine cellular mechanisms underlying CD1d-dependent tolerogenicity of pMφ, in vitro and in vivo characteristics of pMφ were investigated. Unlike dendritic cells or splenic Mφ, pMφ from CD1d<sup>+/-</sup> mice showed lower expression levels of costimulatory molecule CD86 and produced lower amounts of inflammatory cytokines upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation compared to pMφ from CD1d-deficient mice. In a CIA model of CD1d-deficient mice, adoptively transferred pMφ from WT mice reduced the severity of arthritis. However, pMφ from CD1d-deficient mice were unable to reduce the severity of arthritis. Hence, the tolerogenicity of pMφ is a cell-intrinsic property that is probably conferred by iNKT cells during pMφ development rather than by interactions of pMφ with iNKT cells during antigen presentation to cognate T cells.

Revolutionary Activities of God in Behalf of the Weak in the Song of Hannah : The Song’s Communal Character and Contribution to the Expansion of Thanksgiving,2021,"['The Song of Hannah', 'Thanksgiving', 'Revolutionary God', 'Communal  Worship', 'RevelatoryText']",,"In this research, I inquire into how and why the descriptions of a revolutionary God who acts in behalf of the weak and needy would contribute to the expansion of authentic thanksgiving. The Song of Hannah shows the general pattern of thanksgiving, which is made up of Outcry―God’s response―Thanksgiving. However, its description of a revolutionary God for the weak and needy, which seems to be rarely found in thanksgiving, paradoxically plays a significant role in making this Song an authentic song of thanksgiving. In the ritual context, the God who turns things upside down is beneficial for both the thanks-givers and the suffered. The theme of a revolutionary God in the Song of Hannah promotes the expansion of thanksgiving among Christians by encouraging their participation in both communal lament and thanksgiving. Considering the Song of Hannah as being full of witness to God’s revolutionary activities, I propose that communal thanksgiving using this Song will encourage interpersonal dynamics within the community and its spiritual transformation. The Song of Hannah presents the move from personal thanksgiving to a broader horizon, i.e., the ongoing activity of God in behalf of the weak and needy. Including the activities of God for the weak in their communal thanksgiving will regenerate the additional dynamic following the general pattern of Outcry―God’s Response― Thanksgiving. Through interpersonal dynamics within the communal worship context, both thanks-givers and the suffered would experience the Song of Hannah as a revelatory text that provides new meaning and the expansion of thanksgiving among them."

The contents of the portfolio include the artefacts used in microteaching, feedback-related materials, and reflective essays. The portfolio encourages students to reflect upon their own learning progress over time (Seldin 1997/2007).The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, it summarises the necessity of cultivating teachers' reflective powers and the concept of a teaching portfolio which is supposed to contribute to this development. Secondly, it examines the significance of the teaching portfolio by analysing the teaching portfolio of student Y and overviewing the process of thought transformation.The method of research was to analyse the reflective essays of student Y in the Japanese language teacher training course to examine how she changed her thinking through six sessions of practice (microteaching and teaching practice) over a period of two years.As a result of the analysis, it became clear that Student Y faced two issues, namely time allocation in class management and changing her own mind, and she reflected upon these throughout the six sessions. This was not a one-time event, but a reflection that was conducted over six sessions. This can be considered to be part of the significance of the teaching portfolio.

Green areas within the cities are indeed known to bring positive effects, such as mitigating urban heat island effects through the development of fresh wind, decreasing air pollution, including fine dust, and the revitalization of communities. However, the quantitative analysis of positive effects of vegetation and the range of the impacts is not enough, whose verification is the aim of this study. Method: This study performed CFD(Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulation and the actual measurements of weather to examine the effects of green areas in Indongchon, one of the regeneration and revitalization areas in Daegu Metropolitan City, and surrounding areas on the nearby environment. The results were used to estimate the influence of previously created green space and analyze that of planned green areas. Result: It compared the examination results of the weather data and CFD simulation results and verified the feasibility of the model. The simulation model was utilized to inspect the impacts of previously formed green areas on the nearby environment and confirm that each type of green space has a different effect."

Since game scenes are required to be rendered in real time, rendering high-resolutional game scenes in real time is very challenging. Therefore, increasing the resolution of game scenes rendered in low resolution is very promising. In order to present a fast super resolution algorithm, we implement our super resolution algorithm using a sparse matrix operation that can be accelerated through a matrix multiplication unit (MMU). Since many open source GPUs present an acceleration environment, our MMU-based approach can be implemented in many open source GPUs. As a baseline of our approach, we present a sparse matrix multiplication formula of bilinear interpolation and bicubic interpolation. We furthermore present a sparse matrix multiplication form of a convolution operation, which is necessary for deep learning-based super resolution algorithms. The filters employed in the convolution operations are converted to a series of sparse matrices, which are multiplied to complete the deep learning-based super resolution model. We demonstrate the performance of our approach by measuring peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and mean opinion score (MOS) of the result images generated by our approach and by the existing methods."
Adaptive Interconnection and Damping Assignment Passivity Based Control for Underactuated Mechanical Systems,2021,"['Adaptive control', 'Hamiltonian systems', 'passivity-based control', 'underactuated mechanical systems']",,"In this paper, we present two adaptive control approaches to handle uncertainties caused by parametric and modeling errors in a class of nonlinear systems with uncertainties. The methods use the Port-controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) modelling framework and the interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC) control design methodology being the most effectively applicable method to such models. The methods explore an extension on the classical IDA-PBC by adopting the state-transformation, yielding a dynamic state-feedback controller that asymptotically stabilizes a class of underactuated mechanical systems and preserves the PCH structure of the augmented closed-loop system. The results are applied to the underactuated mechanical systems that are a class of mechanical systems with broad applications and are more interesting as well as challenging control problems within this context. The results are illustrated with numerical simulations applied to twounderactuated robotic systems; the Acrobot and non-prehensile planar rolling robotic (disk-on-disk) systems."

From the simulation results of fault analysis in MVDC distribution system based on the modeling for impact evaluation on distribution system with the fault scenarios, it is confirmed that tremendous fault current can be momentarily occurred due to discharging of DC link capacitor in converter station regardless of fault type. Furthermore, it is found that the faults in MVDC feeder can cause the phenomenon of under-voltage at customers in other feeder of the main transformer. In addition, it is clear that the malfunction of recloser in other feeder can be prevented due to ungrounded system of MVDC system, and also the voltages of AC 22.9kV bus and MVDC feeder are maintained in a stable manner even if ground fault is occurred in AC 22.9kV feeder."

The objective of this method is to transform a real transversal section of a model for a laminated composite bar into a hypothetical virtual section that is homogenous and isotropic. An analogy with the transformed-section method for solving composite beams under flexion was conducted. The shear stresses (maximum on external surfaces and interfaces) in laminated composite bars were undergoing torsion. Isotropic symmetric and asymmetric laminated composite bars were examined analytically, and the results of their respective experimental and numerical tests were analyzed. The proposed method exhibits differences between 2 % and 12 % compared with the experimental results and between 2 % and 10 % compared with the results obtained using the finite element method."
Recent research towards integrated deterministic-probabilistic safety assessment in Korea,2021,"['Integrated deterministic-probabilistic safety assessment', 'Residual risk', 'DICE (Dynamic Integrated Consequence Evaluation)', 'DeBATE (Deep learning-Based Accident Trend Estimation)']",,"For a long time, research into integrated deterministic-probabilistic safety assessment has been continuously conducted to point out and overcome the limitations of classical ET (event tree)/FT (fault tree) based PSA (probabilistic safety assessment). The current paper also attempts to assert the reason why a technical transformation from classical PSA is necessary with a re-interpretation of the categories of risk. In this study, residual risk was classified into interpolating- and extrapolating-censored categories, which represent risks that are difficult to identify through an interpolation or extrapolation of representative scenarios due to potential nonlinearity between hardware and human behaviors intertwined in time and space. The authors hypothesize that such risk can be dealt with only if the classical ETs/FTs are freely relocated, entailing large-scale computation associated with physical models. The functional elements that are favorable to find residual risk were inferred from previous studies. The authors then introduce their under-development enabling techniques, namely DICE (Dynamic Integrated Consequence Evaluation) and DeBATE (Deep learning-Based Accident Trend Estimation). This work can be considered as a preliminary initiative to find the bridging points between deterministic and probabilistic assessments on the pillars of big data technology."

It has passed de-industrialization and is entering the information age and the fourth industrial age. Therefore modes of transportation are also rapidly changing. With the growth and development of the city, the railroad industry is also being transformed and improved to meet modern needs. As a result, most of the stations that are no longer used are neglected. We intend to revitalize abandoned stations. They have great historical significance based in the historical industrial era in Korea. Therefore, this study aims to analyze cases where place marketing has been applied and suggest ways to utilize local coexistence to create win win cooperation. (Method) Concept is divided into analysis and research. The concept and cause of abandoned stations and the concept and case of place marketing are examined in Chapter 2. Discovery and analysis of the characteristics using the case of abandoned stations as a place marketing is examined in Chapter 3. Conclusions are drawn focusing on the revitalization plans through analysis and utilizing place marketing in Chapter 4. (Results) As a result of the case analysis according to the utilization of place marketing elements, the revitalization of abandoned stations did not conform to a homogeneous plan. When various marketing directions are considered and new utilization measures are proposed, the cultural value as an abandoned station become apparent and their unique value can be rediscovered. (Conclusions) The abandoned stations have historical and cultural value beyond the existence of a single building. This is integrally related to the characteristics of the region. As a result, abandoned stations become treasured based on the history, culture, and living environment of the region. Between development and conservation, various attempts should be made to promote preservation and revitalization based on the location. Historical and sentimental values must be reflected as an adjunct to practical spatial and functional use. Based on this, local identity must be strengthened and local values must be rediscovered in conjunction with the broader plans of the region at the economic/cultural level. To this end, the abandoned station must be created as a regeneration space managed and operated within the region while establishing an organic relationship with other tourism entities. It is necessary as well, to propose a recycling plan suitable for each location. Many institutions and local governments are looking for creative ways to revitalize abandoned stations. It is acknowledged that there is a negative perception regarding abandoned stations due to a one-dimensional business development model. However, the methodology and results of this study suggest that the recognition of the historical and cultural value of these abandoned stations suggest a useful direction for revitalization centered on place marketing history."

The offline watch retail market is undergoing a rapid transformation due to technology intervention in the product portfolio and the advent of online retailing. The study identifies the interrelationships amongst the constructs of interdependence, trust, affective commitment, and information exchange to form long-lasting relational bonds in the watch industry. Research design, data and methodology: We used a path analysis to investigate the relationship between interdependence, trust, affective commitment, and information exchange. Data has been collected from 143 watch retailers using judgmental sampling method. Results: The data analysis suggested the establishment of measurement and structural model. The absolute and relative goodness of fit models in the causal analysis are 0.628 and 0.959 suggesting a sufficient fit index. Based on the analysis of direct and indirect effects, the results indicate that trust fully mediates the effect of interdependence and information exchange of retailers with the manufacturer. Conclusions: Trust plays an important role in driving commitment and information exchange between watch manufacturers and retailers. Interdependence in the manufacturer-channel relationships would lead to affective commitment only when trust exists in the relationship. [AMAWATE, Vibhas.] in Web of Science and Scopus)."

The purpose of this study is to present the direction of design policy to strengthen national design competitiveness through analysis of Korean design competitiveness and design policy cases of Singapore, UK and Denmark. In this study, the competitiveness of Korean design policy was analyzed by Michael Porter's diamond model. In addition, the design policy cases of each country were compared and analyzed targeting countries with high national competitiveness and high design competitiveness among the countries that are pursuing government-led design policies. Korea has achieved quantitative and qualitative growth within a short period of time by promoting the government-led design policy, and has made a leap forward in tandem with Korea's industrial development. However, there are also limitations behind that, such as growth imbalance by company size and region, and reduction in design investment. Singapore, UK, and Denmark use design as a core value at the level of national competitiveness and national brand that leads industrial and social innovation, while Korea still focuses on the functional role of design that supports the industry. In order to reinforce Korea's design competitiveness, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive design policy at the national level based on the transformation of the design policy from the design industry to an expanded concept such as public and new industries."
Fermented Red Ginseng Alleviates Ovalbumin-Induced Inflammation in Mice by Suppressing Interleukin-4 and Immunoglobulin E Expression,2021,"['allergic rhinitis', 'fermented red ginseng', 'OVA', 'probiotics']",,"Ginseng (the root of Panax ginseng Meyer) has been reported to have many biologic therapeutic effects, including anti-inflammatory properties, and ginsenosides are considered as one of the factors responsible for these therapeutic effects. To improve their therapeutic action, probiotic bacteria are used to ferment and chemically transform ginsenosides in red ginseng (RG). In this study, we aimed to investigate the beneficial effects of RG fermented by probiotic bacteria (FRG) against ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic rhinitis in a mouse model. We induced the mouse model via OVA inhalation; experimental results revealed increased immunoglobulin E (IgE) and interleukin (IL)-4 levels, leading to Th2-type cytokine response. The mice with induced allergy were then orally administered RG and FRG over 2 weeks, as a result of which, IL-4 and IgE levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, nasal fluid, and serum were found to be ameliorated more effectively by FRG than by RG, suggesting that FRG has better immune regulatory effects than RG. FRG also downregulated immune cell levels, such as those of eosinophils and basophils, and significantly decreased the thickness of OVA-induced respiratory epithelium compared to RG. Collectively, the results showed that FRG treatment alleviates inflammation, thereby extending a protective effect to mice with OVA-induced inflammatory allergic rhinitis."

Green Bonds Driving Sustainable Transition in Asian Economies: The Case of India,2021,"['Green Bond', 'Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)', 'Green Financing', 'Climate Finance', 'Environmental Finance']",,"On September 25, 2015, 193 countries of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly, signed the 2030 Agenda to work towards attaining 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and its associated 169 targets and 232 indicators. With one of the largest renewable energy programs, India is well-poised to be a role model for low-carbon transformation to other Asian countries. However, bridging the financing gap is critical to ensure that the country meets its SDG targets. Though the SDGs identified by the UN are broad-based and interdependent, for ease of analysis we have grouped them into five themes – people, planet, prosperity, peace, and partnership – based on existing UN models. This paper investigates the financing gap for ‘green’ projects linked to planet-related SDG targets in India. It builds an argument for utilizing green bonds as an instrument to bridge the gap. After establishing the potential of green bonds in raising the finance to meet India’s planet-related SDG targets, we look at the current policy landscape and suggest recommendations for successful execution. The paper concludes that deepening of the corporate fixed income securities market and firming up guidelines in line with India’s climate action plans are inevitable before green bonds can be considered a viable financing option."

Ultraviolet Light-Responsive Photorheological Fluid for Sensors and Actuators Realized by Phosphorescence Effects and LSTM RNN,2021,"['smart fluid', 'photorheological fluid', 'phosphorescence', 'linearization', 'LSTM RNN']",,"A photo-rheological fluid (PRF) is a smart fluid which exhibits different viscosity under UV irradiation. A PRF is comprehensively presented in this work, with particular focus on its responses under UV off/on conditions. The isomeric conversion from SP to MC and vice versa under UV off and on, respectively, showed unequal rates of transformation. As a result, a complex non-linear hysteretic response was observed. To be used indifferent types of sensors and actuators which can exploit its rheological properties, it is essential the PRF have linearized hysteresis behavior. To minimize the asymmetric non-linear hysteresis characteristics under UV on and off conditions, the well-known long-lasting phosphor SAO (SrAl2O4:Eu2+, Dy3+) was incorporated. The incorporation of SAO in the PRF improved the linearity of the PRF response, although the conversion rate was not identical under UV off/on conditions. The SAO particles were observed to settle over time due to phase splitting, undermining the usefulness of the SAO-PRF composite. Instead of improving the PRF response by further adjusting the PRF composite, a software approach based on Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM RNN) was employed to model and compensate the asymmetric non-linear hysteresis response, ensuring the realization of sensors and actuators that exploit PRF as hardware."
Design of miniaturized and lightweight coupling inductors for interleaved parallel DC/DC converters,2021,"['Coupling inductor', 'Interleaving technique', 'Miniaturization', 'Lightweight', 'SiC MOSFET']",,"At present, coupled inductance is an effective method for the development of the interleaved parallel converters in terms of high efficiency, miniaturization, and light weight. In view of the difficulty in designing coupling inductors in multiphase interleaved parallel converters, a general coupling inductor design criterion is proposed in this paper. First, the equivalent steady-state inductance and equivalent transient inductance expressions of a converter are obtained according to the modal transformation law of a two-phase interleaved parallel buck converter circuit. In addition, the volume modeling and weight modeling of the core are established, and expressions of the self-inductance and coupling coefficient are obtained. Then, the self-inductance and coupling coefficients are derived with the constraints of the steady-state current ripple and transient response speed as well as the objective function of the volume modeling and weight modeling. It is ensured that the designed coupled inductor successfully achieves its purposes of reducing the volume, weight, and inductor current ripple of the converter while improving the system response speed. Finally, the correctness of the theoretical analysis and the accuracy of the design method were verified on a 40 kW experimental platform based on a SiC MOSFET."
Aucuparin Suppresses Bleomycin-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis Via Anti-Inflammatory Activity,2021,"['aucuparin', 'bleomycin', 'inflammation', 'pulmonary fibrosis']",,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lung disease that results in scarring of the lungs for an unknown reason. Although many studies have been conducted on IPF, precise mechanisms and treatments have not yet been identified. In this study, we found that aucuparin, a natural product isolated from Sorbus aucuparia, inhibited pulmonary fibrosis in a bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis mouse model. In the lung samples of mice treated with aucuparin, the gene expression of inflammation and macrophage activation markers was reduced compared to those treated with BLM alone. Moreover, aucuparin decreased the expression of profibrotic marker genes and increased the expression of antifibrotic marker genes. Finally, we observed that aucuparin significantly suppressed transforming growth factor-β-induced activation of inflammatory cytokine production and collagen synthesis from macrophages and fibroblasts, respectively. Taken together, these data demonstrate that aucuparin inhibits lung fibrosis via its anti-inflammatory action and support its potential to be a therapeutic drug for IPF treatment."

This study investigated the effect on brand advocacy by combining value co-creation of service dominant logic, brand satisfaction of relationship marketing, and brand identification as a mediating variable to develop the mechanism for drawing brand advocacy. In addition, considering that brand advocacy is the result of forming a positive relationship with the brand of consumers, an empirical study was conducted by integrating brand authenticity into the research model.

Development of Automatic Chatter Suppression System in Parallel Milling by Real-Time Spindle Speed Control with Observer-Based Chatter Monitoring,2021,['Parallel milling · Chatter · Process control · Speed difference method · Disturbance observer'],,"To maximize the potential for high material removal rates in simultaneous processes such as parallel milling, developing strategies for successful chatter suppression/avoidance is an important concern for manufacturers. In this study, the effectiveness of the spindle speed difference method (SDM) for chatter suppression is discussed in a parallel end-milling process where a flexible workpiece is machined by two tools rotating in opposite direction. The process model is developed, considering that the dynamic variation due to the regenerative eff ect occurs on a plane perpendicular to the tool axis direction. Through the process simulations and the experiments, this study provides informative discussion for comprehending the process behavior. Additionally, a real-time active chatter suppression system with adaptive SDM, where the spindle speed difference is sequentially optimized during the process according to the tracked chatter frequency, is developed by integrating a chatter monitoring system based on sensorless cutting force estimation with sliding discrete Fourier transform. The results show that the developed real-time adaptive system of spindle speed suppresses chatter vibrations more effectively than non-adaptive SDM system; hence, the integrated system can contribute self-optimizing machining systems oriented to Industry 4.0."

Instead of a teaching method applicable to a specific subject, maker education based on constructivism and experiential learning can be considered as pedagogy that emphasizes the process of solving problems through production and improvement centering on the learning subject. Maker education can utilize various learning models, such as TMI model, design thinking model, and maker-centered learning depending on the content or teaching and learning situation. Maker pedagogy is education centered on the ‘maker’ as an active participant rather than the making activity itself, and it emphasizes the process of cooperation and sharing of makers rather than the output from the making activity. In addition, rather than a space that uses digital materials or tools, maker pedagogy emphasizes a space where learners can learn through play and imagination. Considering the characteristics of home economics education emphasizing on the self-reliance capacity, ability to solve problems in an integrated way through problem solving in learners lives, and practical and critical thinking skills, it can be seen that the philosophical context of maker pedagogy is connected. Thus, it can be considered that the possibility of application is very high.  The assumptions and application directions of maker pedagogy derived in this study are as follows: First, self-directed decision-making and participation. Second, problem-solving process that emphasizes on communication and cooperation while emphasizing on social sustainability. Third, integrated, creative, and convergence thinking and perspective. Fourth, content learning through community experience. It is an experiential learning space of self-reliance and internalization through learned contents. Fifth, the spirit of challenge to accept failure and entrepreneurship. Finally, boundaries and transformation. This study aims to contribute to the future curriculum revision direction by deriving a strategy that can combine the maker pedagogy search with assumptions and characteristics, and suggest implications for the application of the curriculum."

Due to the limited communication capacity, the stochastic communication protocol is adopted to determine when the sensor node is used to transmit data between the sensors and the fault detection filter, the actual measurement signal received by the filter is represented by the L-order Rice fading model. A non-fragile fault detection filter is constructed to generate the residual signal. And in order to analyze the stable of the error dynamics, an auxiliary error system is established. Combining stochastic analysis technique, Lyapunov stability theory, linear matrix inequalities(LMIs) calculation method and H∞ filtering technique, the fault detection problem is transformed into equivalent H∞ filtering problem, the sufficient conditions for the existence of fault detection filter are obtained that ensure stochastically stability of the error dynamics with prescribed H∞ performance constraints. In addition, the filter gains can be calculated by solving the LMI. Finally, a numerical simulation example is given for the effectiveness of the fault detection scheme."

In addition, if the tilt increases, the performance evaluation of the x-ray image system will be problematic. In this study, we analyzed the experimental and analytical models in the modulation transfer function, ie, the Fourier domain, based on the experimental error and analyzed the effect on the spatial frequency. Furthermore, performance evaluation is being carried out for various x-ray imaging systems, and experimental errors are indispensable, and the extent to which they can be tolerated should be reviewed."
Real-time monitoring of liver fibrosis through embedded sensors in a microphysiological system,2021,['Liver fibrosis-on-chip TEER sensor ROS sensor Embedded sensors TGF-β1'],,"Hepatic fibrosis is a foreshadowing of future adverse events like liver cirrhosis, liver failure, and cancer. Hepatic stellate cell activation is the main event of liver fibrosis, which results in excessive extracellular matrix deposition and hepatic parenchyma's disintegration. Several biochemical and molecular assays have been introduced for in vitro study of the hepatic fibrosis progression. However, they do not forecast real-time events happening to the in vitro models. Trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) is used in cell culture science to measure cell monolayer barrier integrity. Herein, we explored TEER measurement's utility for monitoring fibrosis development in a dynamic cell culture microphysiological system. Immortal HepG2 cells and fibroblasts were co-cultured, and transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) was used as a fibrosis stimulus to create a liver fibrosis-on-chip model. A glass chip-based embedded TEER and reactive oxygen species (ROS) sensors were employed to gauge the effect of TGF-β1 within the microphysiological system, which promotes a positive feedback response in fibrosis development. Furthermore, albumin, Urea, CYP450 measurements, and immunofluorescent microscopy were performed to correlate the following data with embedded sensors responses. We found that chip embedded electrochemical sensors could be used as a potential substitute for conventional end-point assays for studying fibrosis in microphysiological systems."

A quantitative assessment method of network information security vulnerability detection risk based on the meta feature system of network security data,2021,"['One-way transmission state', 'Information security vulnerability', 'Risk quantification', 'Assessment', 'The weight']",,"Because the traditional network information security vulnerability risk assessment method does not set the weight, it is easy for security personnel to fail to evaluate the value of information security vulnerability risk according to the calculation value of network centrality, resulting in poor evaluation effect. Therefore, based on the network security data element feature system, this study designed a quantitative assessment method of network information security vulnerability detection risk under single transmission state. In the case of single transmission state, the multi-dimensional analysis of network information security vulnerability is carried out by using the analysis model. On this basis, the weight is set, and the intrinsic attribute value of information security vulnerability is quantified by using the qualitative method. In order to comprehensively evaluate information security vulnerability, the efficacy coefficient method is used to transform information security vulnerability associated risk, and the information security vulnerability risk value is obtained, so as to realize the quantitative evaluation of network information security vulnerability detection under single transmission state. The calculated values of network centrality of the traditional method and the proposed method are tested respectively, and the evaluation of the two methods is evaluated according to the calculated results. The experimental results show that the proposed method can be used to calculate the network centrality value in the complex information security vulnerability space network, and the output evaluation result has a high signal-to-noise ratio, and the evaluation effect is obviously better than the traditional method."

"The arachidonic acid metabolite 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid alleviates pulmonary fibrosis",2021,[],,"Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are metabolites of arachidonic acid that are rapidly metabolized into diols by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). sEH inhibition has been shown to increase the biological activity of EETs, which are known to have anti-inflammatory properties. However, the role of EETs in pulmonary fibrosis remains unexplored. Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to analyze EETs in the lung tissues of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF, n = 29) and controls ( n = 15), and the function of 11,12-EET was evaluated in in vitro and in vivo in pulmonary fibrosis models. EET levels in IPF lung tissues, including those of 8,9-EET, 11,12-EET, and 14,15-EET, were significantly lower than those in control tissues. The 11,12-EET/11,12-DHET ratio in human lung tissues also differentiated IPF from control tissues. 11,12-EET significantly decreased transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1-induced expression of α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) and collagen type-I in MRC-5 cells and primary fibroblasts from IPF patients. sEH-specific siRNA and 1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl) urea (TPPU; sEH inhibitor) also decreased TGF-β1-induced expression of α-SMA and collagen type-I in fibroblasts. Moreover, 11,12-EET and TPPU decreased TGF-β1-induced p-Smad2/3 and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) expression in primary fibroblasts from patients with IPF and fibronectin expression in Beas-2B cells. TPPU decreased the levels of hydroxyproline in the lungs of bleomycin-induced mice. 11,12-EET or sEH inhibitors could inhibit pulmonary fibrosis by regulating TGF-β1-induced profibrotic signaling, suggesting that 11,12-EET and the regulation of EETs could serve as potential therapeutic targets for IPF treatment."

This study is devoted to the development of a zero-current switching QRC with improved characteristics. The main advantages of this QRC are a wide range of regulation and a low level of output voltage ripple. These advantages are achieved by the recuperation of excess energy due to a transistor shunting the primary winding of a transformer. In this work, a mathematical model of advanced QRC (AQRC) is developed, and the quantitative relationship between the parameters of the AQRC power circuit elements is established. In addition, the electromagnetic processes occurring in the AQRC are studied on the Simulink model. Moreover, the AQRC characteristics for various operating modes are studied, and the rational parameters of its components are determined. Then, an AQRC prototype is created. The tests of the prototype are in good agreement with the models. Results show that the AQRC allows for the adjustment of the output voltage ranging from 0 to 100% of the rated value and has a standard level of electromagnetic compatibility."

The inhibitor was evaluated as corrosioninhibitor for mild in 1 M HCl corrosive solution by potentiodynamic polarization (PDP), electrochemicalimpedance spectroscopy (EIS), weight loss, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy,atomic force microscopy (AFM), and energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDX-RF) spectrometry methods.The results showed that the inhibition efficiency of m-pentadecylphenol was at least 95% at an optimalconcentration (300 ppm). The inhibition efficiency was found to increase as the inhibitorconcentration increments from 100 to 300 ppm. Further studies revealed the inhibition performance ofm-pentadecylphenol to be marginally reliant on temperature as the temperature rises from 303 to333 K. At 333 K, the inhibition performance of the inhibitor was still promising (about 85%) when theconcentration was 300 ppm. The adsorption studies revealed the spontaneous aptitude of mpentadecylphenolto inhibit corrosion by forming a non-conductive inhibitive layer on the mild steel surfacemainly through the chemisorption mechanism. The chemisorption adsorption was satisfactorilydescribed by the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model. Besides, the potentiodynamic polarization measurementsrevealed m-pentadecylphenol to act as an anodic inhibitor. The overall findings revealed thatm-pentadecylphenol to be an effective corrosion inhibitor in harsh corrosive vicinities with the addedadvantages of being eco-friendly and relatively cheaper.

A meta-analysis of variance compared the prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction according to regional, chronological, demographic, and methodologic factors, respectively.Results: The overall pooled prevalence rates of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction were 51.4% and 47.5%, respectively, in the random-effect model. In subgroup analyses, the prevalence rates of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction were significantly different among four geographical regions (both P < 0.001, respectively). Although the prevalence rates of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction did not significantly differ according to the time of enrollment, the subgroup analyses including only studies from the same geographical region (Europe) revealed a significant difference in olfactory dysfunction according to the time of enrollment.Conclusion: The regional and chronological differences in the prevalence rates of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions partly explain the wide inter-study variability."
Proposal of the energy consumption analysis process for the residential houses using big data analytics technique,2021,"['big data', 'open data', 'residential houses', 'energy consumption', 'data collection', 'correlation analysis', 'data visualization']",,"Recently, nations around the world have been implementing various policies to reduce energy consumption by improving “building energy performance” at the governmental level. In addition, “the public data opening system” has been institutionalized so that private companies could reproduce useful information by utilizing public data. However, it is insufficient to improve the energy performance of residential houses by analysing the actual energy consumption of residential houses using public open data. This study proposes a “Big Data Analysis Process for Residential Housing Energy Consumption” by utilizing public open data. This process is organized into four stages as follows: Data Understanding, regarding exploring and collecting architectural data, meteorological data, and energy consumption data; Data Processing, regarding the transforming energy consumption data of residential housing and reference input data to make master data, which is analysis data that have been processed by filtering, refining, and type conversion of the collected data, for the big data analysis; Data Analytics, development of an analysis model for the energy consumption of residential housing applying analysis algorithm; Evaluation, data assessment and application of the analytical model.The purpose of this study is to reproduce green remodeling with useful information: analysing a variety of data open to the private sector using big data analysis techniques. It is expected that the “Big Data Analysis Process for Energy Consumption” will be used to confirm the correlation between the energy consumption of residential houses and the architectural elements, and to effectively derive the energy performance improvement factors for energy saving in buildings."
Respiratory-correlated 4D digital tomosynthesis with deep convolutional neural networks for image-guided radiation therapy,2021,['4D digital tomosynthesis · Convolutional neural network · Quantitative accuracy · Spatial resolution · Image noise'],,"4D digital tomosynthesis (DTS) techniques for image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) are able to reduce radiation dose, scan and reconstruction time compared to 4D cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). In spite of these benefits, the 4D DTS techniques cause the degradation of image quality due to an intrinsic imaging strategy and consequently reduce treatment accuracy. In this study, a deep learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN) framework was proposed for 4D DTS imaging. The proposed CNN framework consisted of the data restoration network based on a U-Net and the denoising network combined with a 2D wavelet transform, and the network training was implemented with clinical images. The quality of the 4D DTS images obtained from the proposed model was evaluated in terms of quantitative accuracy, spatial resolution and noise property. The results showed that the proposed CNN framework improved the quantitative accuracy of 4D DTS images by 3–19%, and the spatial resolution and noise for the proposed CNN framework were reduced by 2.24–7.33% and 8.92–40.07%, respectively, in comparison to other imaging models. These results represented that the degradation of the 4D DTS image quality can be recovered using the proposed CNN framework, and the proposed model is suitable for maintaining spatial resolution as well as suppressing noise and artifacts. In conclusion, the proposed CNN framework can be potentially used to improve the quality of 4D DTS images for the IGRT."
Splenectomy improves liver fibrosis via tumor necrosis factor superfamily 14 (LIGHT) through the JNK/TGF-β1 signaling pathway,2021,[],,"Splenectomy has been reported to improve liver fibrosis in patients with cirrhosis and hypersplenism. However, the mechanisms remain unclear. Tumor necrosis factor superfamily 14 (TNFSF14; also known as LIGHT) is highly expressed in the context of fibrosis and promotes disease progression in patients with fibrotic diseases such as pulmonary and skin fibrosis. Here, we determined whether splenectomy controls the production of LIGHT to improve liver fibrosis. Splenectomy reduced serum LIGHT levels in cirrhotic patients with hypersplenism and a ConA-induced liver fibrosis mouse model. Blocking LIGHT resulted in the downregulation of TGF-β1 in RAW264.7 cells. LIGHT treatment of RAW264.7 and JS1 cells in coculture regulated transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) expression through the activation of JNK signaling. Small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of lymphotoxin β receptor (LTβR) in macrophages resulted in pronounced decreases in the levels of fibrosis and αSMA in JS1 cells. These results indicated that LIGHT bound to LTβR and drove liver fibrosis in vitro. Blocking TGF-β1 abolished the effect of LIGHT in vitro. Furthermore, the administration of recombinant murine LIGHT protein-induced liver fibrosis with splenectomy, while blocking LIGHT without splenectomy improved liver fibrosis in vivo, revealing that the decrease in fibrosis following splenectomy was directly related to reduced levels of LIGHT. Thus, high levels of LIGHT derived from the spleen and hepatic macrophages activate JNK signaling and lead to increased TGF-β1 production in hepatic macrophages. Splenectomy attenuates liver fibrosis by decreasing the expression of LIGHT."

Yet, the world-systems analysis applies transnational, macroscopic, holistic, and functional perspectives in ways that tend to oversimplify China’s transformation, casting its change as a product of capitalist forces that originate outside of the country. Accordingly, world-systems researchers have often overlooked and under-analyzed the impact of certain historical events that began from within China. In this study, I intend to forge a link between theory and reality by analyzing how major 19th century evens in China (e.g., Opium War, the Taiping Rebellion, and the Sino-Japanese War) connect the country to the dynamics of the capitalist world-system models. This works presents a new methodology of incorporating dynamics as an alternative to past world-system methodologies. Incorporating dynamics serves as one means of analytically reinterpreting Chinese history in ways that better contextualize its domestic dynamics with those of capitalist world-system accounts."
Role of Akt1 in renal fibrosis and tubular dedifferentiation during the progression of acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease,2021,"['Acute kidney injury', 'Akt1', 'Chronic kidney disease', 'Tubular dedifferentiation', 'Renal fibrosis']",,"Background/Aims: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an underestimated yet important risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), characterized by tubulointerstitial fibrosis and tubular dedifferentiation. Tubular dedifferentiation, which is associated with the loss of epithelial markers and the gain of mesenchymal features, is thought to be involved in tubulointerstitial fibrosis. As protein kinase B/Akt is involved in the development of CKD, we investigated the role of Akt1, one of the three Akt isoforms, in a murine model of AKI-to-CKD progression.Methods: We subjected C57BL/6 male mice to unilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury (UIRI) and harvested their kidneys after 6 weeks. Mice were divided into four groups, namely, wild-type (WT) UIRI, Akt1<sup>-/-</sup> UIRI, WT sham, and Akt1<sup>-/-</sup> sham.Results: Akt1 (but not Akt2 or Akt3) was markedly activated in WT UIRI mice than in WT sham mice. Tubulointerstitial fibrosis and tubular dedifferentiation significantly increased in WT UIRI mice, but were attenuated in Akt1<sup>-/-</sup> UIRI mice. Both WT UIRI and Akt1<sup>-/-</sup> UIRI mice showed markedly upregulated transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)/Smad signaling compared with WT sham mice. However, TGF-β1/Smad expression did not differ between the two groups. The levels of phosphorylated GSK-3β, β-catenin, and Snail were attenuated in Akt1<sup>-/-</sup> UIRI mice compared with those in WT UIRI mice.Conclusions: Deletion of Akt1 results in the attenuation of renal fibrosis and tubular dedifferentiation, independent of TGF-β1/Smad signaling, during AKI-to- CKD progression in a UIRI without contralateral nephrectomy model. Thus, Akt1 may serve as a therapeutic target in AKI-to-CKD progression."

Allen, Rev. Horace G. Underwood, and Dr. Oliver R. Evison are beyond description. We cannot neglect any one of the three who had devoted their passion as pioneers in missionary work. However, Dr. Allen soon changed his position of medical missionary to public office of US legation, and Rev. Underwood died in 1916, the next year after he had established Chosun Christian College. For this reason, Dr. Evison must be the most significant  contributor to both Severance (Union Medical College) and Yonhee College. Unquestionably, he was a pivotal figure connecting Severance and Yonhee, and uniting them into one, Yonsei. That is why the diversified study of him is more required than anyone else.  To understand Dr. Evison properly, at first we need to do some research about the people who had a great influence on his life. They were his father Simeon Evison, who was a role model of life at home, Professor E. B. Shuttleworth, who led him into the way to medical school, and Rev. Underwood, a lifelong partner. Secondly, we consider his 43-year-missionary-work that he had achieved since entering the barren Chosun land (Korea) in four aspects: medical missionary work, evangelical missionary work, educational missionary work, and social missionary work. Through this we can find some crucial facts: at the root of these missionary works there are the spirit of Christianity, those are the spirit of person-centeredness, the spirit of equality, the spirit of ecumenism, and the spirit of social transformation. After all the process of this study, we will clarify how the academic tradition of Yonsei University has expanded from Dr. Evison, and how we in this time can succeed and develop it."

Sharing and Privacy in PHRs: Efficient Policy Hiding and Update Attribute-based Encryption,2021,"['Attribute-based Encryption', 'Attribute Bloom Filter', 'Personal Health Records', 'Policy Hiding', 'Policy Update']",,"Personal health records (PHRs) is an electronic medical system that enables patients to acquire, manage and share their health data. Nevertheless, data confidentiality and user privacy in PHRs have not been handled completely. As a fine-grained access control over health data, ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) has an ability to guarantee data confidentiality. However, existing CP-ABE solutions for PHRs are facing some new challenges in access control, such as policy privacy disclosure and dynamic policy update. In terms of addressing these problems, we propose a privacy protection and dynamic share system (PPADS) based on CP-ABE for PHRs, which supports full policy hiding and flexible access control. In the system, attribute information of access policy is fully hidden by attribute bloom filter. Moreover, data user produces a transforming key for the PHRs Cloud to change access policy dynamically. Furthermore, relied on security analysis, PPADS is selectively secure under standard model. Finally, the performance comparisons and simulation results demonstrate that PPADS is suitable for PHRs."

Haidt’s moral psychology theory and make up for its disadvantages. Haidt systematically captures the dark side of humanity that occurs when moral intuition is expressed through interlocking with socio-cultural contexts. The dark side is the bias revealed at the individual and collective level and the extreme conflict situation resulting from the bias. This situation is based on a set of mechanisms by which moral intuition is activated. Therefore, in relation to Interpersonal relations promotion․ Unification․Multiculturalism․Civic Education, if we reflect on the bias resulting from moral intuition, exhaustive and extreme conflict situations can be transformed into a phase in which constructive discussions are possible. Despite these advantages, Haidt’s theory has the limitation of not specifying how to reflect on bias and how educational methods can discuss fallacies resulting from bias through reasonable logical processes. This limitation can be supplemented through the ‘Haidt-style Moral Insight Model’. This model aims at practical efforts to dedicate oneself to meaningful moral self without being swept away by bias resulting from moral intuition."
Study on a novel N-doped mesoporous carbon for the efficient removal of methylene blue from aqueous solution,2021,"['Adsorption mechanism', 'Characterization', 'Mesoporous carbon', 'Methylene blue', 'Nitrogen doping']",,"A novel N-doped mesoporous carbon (AC-N) was prepared by impregnation method on the basis of cypress-derived activated carbon for methylene blue (MB) removal. The introduction of nitrogen atoms with appropriate proportion could improve MB adsorption capacity of the prepared mesoporous carbon (AC-N). AC-N obtained at optimized modification (1 ㏖/L urea) had an excellent MB adsorption of 910.95 ㎎/g and the removal efficiency was ca. 91% at 25℃. Elemental analysis showed that the nitrogen content of AC-N was high up to 2.6%. A large specific surface area (SBET) 1,215 ㎤/g and an obvious mesoporous structure with a high mesopore to total pore volume ratio (Vmes/Vtot) 91% was observed on AC-N. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicated a successful doping of nitrogen element into the mesoporous carbon and pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N and amino-N were existed in AC-N. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) were also used to characterize this prepared adsorbent. MB adsorption kinetics parameters and isotherm results on the produced carbon were well fitted by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir model. According to the thermodynamic analysis, the adsorption of MB on AC-N was found to be an endothermic, spontaneous process in nature."
A Study on ESG-based Management Strategies of Representative Enterprises in Asia,2021,"['ESG Strategy (ESG전략)', 'Design Management(디자인 경영)', 'Enterprise Innovation(기업 혁신)', 'Business Sustainability(비즈니스 지속가능성)']","세계 각지의 기업들이 비즈니스 지속가능성의 중요성을 인식하면서 환경(Environment), 사회(Social), 지배구조(Governance) (ESG) 지표를 경영 전략에 포함시켜 기업 실적을 보다 전면적으로 평가하고 있다. 이는 디자인 경영 분야의 최근 트렌드로 볼 수 있다. ESG에 대한 조치는 지난 몇 년간 아시아 지역에서 성장세를 보였으며, 한국과 중국 그리고 일본의 대표적인 많은 기업들이 ESG 경영으로의 전환을 시도하고 있다. 본 논문의 목적은 ESG 경영 방면에서 뛰어난 성과를 보여준 유명 기업들의 사례를 고찰함으로써 오늘날 아시아 기업들이 ESG 기반 경영 전략을 어떻게 실현하고 있는지 파악하고, 나아가 ESG 기반경영 전략이 어떻게 기업 경영에 기여하고 혁신을 선도하는 지에 대해 탐구하는 것이다. 연구 방법으로는 우선 문헌 종합 서술을 통해 ESG의 역사와 이론적 배경 그리고 기업 혁신에의 기여에 관해 이론적 관점에서 연구하였다. 그런 다음 사례연구를 통해 연차보고서, 뉴스, 아티클, 홈페이지 내용 등을 비롯한 문헌을 수집 및 분석하고 ESG와 관련해 뛰어난 성과를 보인 대표적인 아시아 기업 3곳을 조사해 ESG 경영전략이 어떻게 실현 되었는지에 대해 분석하였다. 마지막으로, 추가적인 분석을 통해 ESG 기반 경영 전략통용 모델을 도출하여, ESG 조치를 기업 전반에 접목하는 업무 전략이 기업의 경영을 촉진하고 기업 혁신의 가치를 제고할 수 있음을 설명하였다. 본 연구 결과에 따르면 desirability(고객이 원하는 것을 해결해 줄 수 있는가), feasibility(기술적으로 구현이 가능한 해결책인가), viability(판매를 통해 수익 창출이 가능한가)의 종합적인 균형을 통해 ESG 전략을 수립하는 것은 3중 마지노선(triple-bottom-line)과 디자인 씽킹의 3요소와 상호대응관계가 있다. 따라서 ESG의 세가지 방면을 잘 결합하여 경영 전략을 설계하면 경영문제를 효과적으로 해결하고 혁신을 일으킬 수 있다. 한 가지 유의할 점은, ESG 기반 경영 전략의 유효성은 기업의 전반적인 업무 비전과 일치하는지에 의해 좌우되며, ESG 경영 전략을 전반적인 업무 전략에 도입시킴으로써 효과적으로 수익을 창출할 수 있다는 점이다. 이 밖에도 전망성의 관점에서 보았을 때 ESG 방면에서 뛰어난 성과를 보이는 기업들은 동종 업계의 여타 기업들에 비해 높은 경쟁력을 지니는 것으로 나타났는데, 이는 ESG기반 경영 전략이 장기적인 가치 창출 능력 함양에 도움을 주기 때문이다. 향후, 본 연구 결과가 ESG의 전환 경로를 모색하는 동종 업계기업들에게 가이드라인이 되기를 기대한다.","Increasingly, enterprises worldwide are becoming aware of the importance of business sustainability, so environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics are being integrated into management strategies to assess enterprise performance holistically, which can be considered as a fad in the design management field recently. Despite slow gains, ESG initiatives gained momentum in Asia over the last few years, many enterprises represented by those in South Korea, China, and Japan are seeking to accelerate their ESG management transformation. The purpose of this paper is to gain an understanding of how the ESG-based management strategy is currently implemented in Asian enterprises by examining prominent firms with excellent ESG performance and to discover how it contributes to enterprise management and leads to innovation. For the research methods, firstly, preliminary research is conducted through the literature review on the historical and theoretical backgrounds of ESG and the related theoretical knowledge of how ESG helps for enterprise innovation. Secondly, through case studies, three representative Asian enterprises with excellent ESG performance are investigated by collecting and analyzing related texts, including annual reports, news, articles, and official websites’ content, to explain how the ESG-based management strategy is implemented in selected companies. Finally, further analysis has resulted in a general ESG-based management strategy model, explaining that integrating ESG initiatives into the enterprises’ holistic business strategy can advance its management and add value to enterprise innovation. The results of this research suggest that developing ESG strategies by balancing the desirability, feasibility, and viability have correspondences with the triple-bottom-line and design thinking’s three key components. Accordingly, well integrating three aspects of ESGs to design the strategy can effectively address management issues and generate innovation. Significantly, the effectiveness of ESG-based management strategies greatly depends on their alignment with the enterprises’ holistic business vision to ensure their inclusion in the entire business strategy in order to yield effective benefits. Moreover, companies that excel in ESG are, from a forward-looking perspective, more competitive than their peers, since ESG-based management strategies will further contribute to their ability to create long-term value. It is expected that the findings of this study may serve as a guide for peer companies seeking to find paths to ESG transformation."

The popularization of start-ups, digital transformation, and WEconomy trends have lowered the barriers to opportunities for women to start a business and provide an environment in which women can grow faster.This paper examines the significance and process of success of women entrepreneurs and the characteristics of innovation strategies and achievements by linking the recently changing business environment of a company, factors influencing the success of women entrepreneurship, and innovation activities. To this end, four companies’ cases were analyzed in the fields of distribution/service and consumer products/services, which are areas of large investment among female startups. The result shows that women entrepreneurs recognize the meaning of success as creating and continuing to create a ‘corporate value through establishing a trust relationship with customers’ within the ‘balance between personal life and work.’ In terms of the business ecosystem, women entrepreneurs strive for ‘business activities based on the win-win growth of consumers, producers and sellers’ for success, and rather ‘focus on the process with a problem-solving approach’ rather than achieving performance-oriented goals. Also through excellent power of observation, flexibility, and execution power, women entrepreneurs conduct business by adapting to changing trends. In terms of innovation activities, the innovation strategy of women-led companies puts priority on ‘creating the value customers want’ and focuses on innovation in the ‘customer-centric business model’ rather than technological innovation. As such, women-led companies show several differentiated characteristics, which enable them to create corporate value and achieve sustainable growth.The barriers to challenges and opportunities for women to start a business have been lowered, and an ecosystem has been created for female startups to grow. But why are there still so few women entrepreneurs, and the answer to where we need to close these gaps is ultimately a close analysis and investigation of the field. We must present milestones for growth steps through the accumulation of case studies of women startups that have exited. In addition, women can stand as economic agents only when the policy targets are subdivided and specific approaches to child-rearing and childcare for women entrepreneurs must be taken. This paper expects to serve as basic data for follow-up studies and become the basis of research for women entrepreneurs to grow as economic agents."
Principal component based fusion of land surface temperature (LST) and panchromatic (PAN) images,2021,"['Fusion', 'Land surface temperature', 'PAN Sharpening', 'Jaipur city', 'LANDSAT8']",,"The spatial details of panchromatic (PAN) images are always higher than land surface temperature (LST) images. The main aim of this paper is to develop a fusion technique for PAN and LST images of the LANDSAT8 satellite. The key is to appropriately estimate the spatial details of the PAN images while preserving the LST image’s thermal contents. The existing methods are incapable to fuse the thermal details of LST images while fully considering the PAN image’s structure, resulting in inaccurate LST estimation and spectral distortion. Principal components (PC) of PAN–LST images can efficiently transfer the spatial details of the PAN image in the spectral information of the LST image. In this paper, a novel fusion algorithm has been proposed named as ‘‘intensity transformation fusion model’’ (ITFM), to downscale LST images using the PC1–PC4. The results have shown that the root mean square error of PAN fused LST images were minimum for PC1 (0.63 C) and maximum for PC4 (1.04 C), respectively. The proposed ITFM method has enhanced spatial resolution and visual distinctiveness of LST images as well as precisely preserved the LST data.The fusion algorithm would help in studies related to the detection of land cover’s thermal emissions, thermal comfort monitoring, urban heat island effect analysis, and LST downscaling applications."

PB-CGBC는 간단한 공침법을 이용하여 합성하였다. 적외선/근적외선 분광광도계, X선 회절분석기, 전계방사형 투과전자현미경, 비표면적 및 기공도 측정기, 제타전위 분석기를 사용하여 흡착제의 물리･화학적 특성과 표면 구조를 분석하였다. 회분식 실험을 바탕으로 PB-CGBC의 세슘 흡착에 대한 흡착속도와 평형실험을 수행하였고 pH, 온도, 초기 세슘 농도 및 반응시간에 대한 영향인자 실험도 함께 진행하였다.결과 및 토의: PB-CGBC의 특성 분석 결과로부터, PB-CGBC 표면에 풍부한 기능기 그룹이 존재하고 독특한 표면구조를 가지고 있음을 확인할 수 있었다. 회분식 흡착 실험에서 PB-CGBC의 세슘 흡착이 발열반응이며 Elovich 속도식과 Temkin 등온식이 PB-CGBC에 대한 세슘 흡착반응을 잘 나타냄을 확인할 수 있었다. PB-CGBC의 최대흡착량은 15℃, 초기 세슘 농도 40 mM, pH 8에서 129.57 mg/g으로 나타났는데 이는 선행 연구된 흡착제들과 비교했을 때, 가장 큰 값이었다.결론: 커피박 바이오차 표면에 프러시안 블루을 담지하여 PB-CGBC를 합성하였으며, 이를 세슘 흡착제거에 성공적으로 적용할 수 있었다. 실험결과로부터 PB-CGBC는 방사성 세슘으로 오염된 폐수를 처리하기 위한 훌륭한 흡착제로서 사용할 수 있을 것이다.","Objectives: Among various radioactive contaminants, radioactive cesium is one of the most harmful radionuclides that causes human health issues due to its high emission of gamma-ray, high solubility, high mobility, high fission yield, and long half-life. Different kinds of adsorbents have been developed for the removal of cesium from radioactive wastewater. Especially, biochar has attracted great attention as a potential adsorbent in the treatment of pollutants and for water purification. In addition, Prussian blue is a cubic lattice structure that contains a cage size similar to the hydrated cesium ionic radius, indicating it can selectively remove cesium ions. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the cesium adsorption performance of synthesized Prussian blue-immobilized coffee ground biochar (PB-CGBC) under various experimental conditions for cesium removal from radioactive wastewater.Methods: After wasted coffee ground was washed and dried, it was heated at 400℃ with 10℃/min of heating rate and 5 h of retention time in a furnace with little or no available air. The PB-CGBC was synthesized using a facile co-precipitation method. Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometer, field emission-transmission electron microscope, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, and zeta potential analyzer were used to analyze physico-chemical characteristics and surface structure of the synthesized adsorbents. The kinetic and equilibrium experiments of cesium adsorption on PB-CGBC were carried out and the effect of pH, temperature, initial cesium concentration, and contact time were also investigated in a batch system.Results and Discussion: The characteristic analysis clearly confirmed the successful synthesis of PB-CGBC, indicating its abundant functional groups and special surface structure. In the batch study, it was found that the cesium adsorption onto the PB-CGBC was exothermic nature. The Elovich kinetic model and Temkin isotherm also provided a good correlation with the cesium adsorption reaction onto the PB-CGBC. The maximum adsorption capacity of PB-CGBC for cesium was 129.57 mg/g at 15℃ and pH 8 at 40 mM of an initial cesium concentration, which was one of the highest values among those of previously reported adsorbents.Conclusions: In this study, the PB-CGBC was synthesized by immobilizing Prussian blue to the surface of coffee ground biochar and successfully applied for the adsorptive removal of cesium ions. Based on the experimental results, the synthesized PB-CGBC can be served as a great adsorbent for treatment of wastewater polluted with radioactive cesium."

For these reasons, B2B suppliers are trying to increase their market responsiveness through customer reference marketing. Although B2B suppliers recognize the importance of customer reference marketing, they have little understanding of how to leverage customer reference marketing to increase their marketing capabilities. Also, the existing literature remain unclear how suppliers are the underlying mechanism through which customer reference marketing increase marketing capability. Because existing studies focus on the relationship between B2B customer recommendation marketing and corporate performance.  Accordingly, from the perspective of organizational learning, the purpose of this research is to empirically investigate the relationship between the portfolio strategy of customer reference marketing, exploratory learning, exploitation learning, and marketing capability  In order to identify the purpose of this research, I　collected data by surveying B2B suppliers implementing the customer reference marketing. The hypothesis was estimated by structural equation modeling. The research model is described as follows.  <그림 본문 참조>  The results of empirical test propose that the portfolio strategy of customer reference marketing is positively related to exploratory learning and exploitation learning. These result means that B2B suppliers can acquire various market-based knowledge through the portfolio strategy of customer reference marketing and promote organizational learning. In addition, I confirmed that exploratory learning and exploitation learning increase marketing capabilities.  Therefore, this study has a contribution to establishing a theoretical model and empirically analyzing the specific process of the B2B customer reference portfolio strategy to increase marketing capabilities from the perspective of organizational learning.

Digital Video Festivals and Mathematics: Changes in the Classroom of the 21st Century,2021,"['activity theory', 'COVID-19', 'digital technology', 'humans-with-media', 'mathematical video']",,"This paper aims to present how video production is impacting the classroom, mathematics students and teachers in Brazil, as well as mathematics knowledge production developed with this media. Digital video Festivals with mathematical content are being implemented in Brazil, locally and nationally. One of them is Mathematics Education Digital Video Festival, organized by the Research Group in Informatics, Other Media and Mathematics Education, GPIMEM. In this century, video is earning space as a pedagogical approach in either face-to-face or distance education, even before the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, considering social distance, the use of videos became an imposed reality to students and teachers. Students and teachers with different level of experience or age started to realize possible positive effects regarding the reorganization of the classroom by the presence of mathematical videos. However, other aspects provided negative effects: for example, inequalities in homes and mobile access impacted equal opportunity to all. This paper will summarize the use of mathematical video in the last century and discuss what is happening this century. We will revise some research developed, mainly in Brazil, that shows how the classroom does not fit in a parallelepiped model. Internet, videos and software combined are “things” that have agency and are co-participating in learning and teaching mathematics. The organization of festivals of videos have become important not only in Brazil but elsewhere in many formats either nationally or internationally, in a way to create challenges, exhibitions, cultural mix that aim to show mathematics applications to the general public. In particular, this article reports on parts of a qualitative research that investigated participants of the first edition of the referred national festival. As a result, we look for the comprehension of following the discussions of qualitative transformations regarding the use of videos in classrooms and mathematics knowledge production, as this new setting suggests that digital technologies arrived in XXI century to collaborate with learning. This article will be supported by a theoretical perspective on technology based on the notion of humans-with- media. In such a perspective knowledge is seen as being constructed by humans and different media and different artifacts. This article shows how such a perspective may help us to cope with the classroom of the XXI century, including the classroom that during the pandemic include students’ and teachers’ homes."

This installation is necessary to isolate the fault section through protection coordination with reclosers installed at the power company (KEPCO). However, a blackout at the customer side may occur as ASS can be operated ahead of the protection device of the power fuse at the fault location due to the fault current reduction. This fault current reduction occurs as the short circuit fault current at the DC side of the ESS may be decreased by the impedance of the distribution transformers. Therefore, this paper presents an operation algorithm for the protection cooperation using a graphic solution method that isolates the fault section by operating the power fuse even with a low fault current. In addition, modeling of the entire system composed of switching gear section, PCS section, battery section, and DC fault generator section is performed by PSCAD/EMTDC. Finally, a testing device for protection cooperation is also implemented based on the proposed algorithm. From the simulations and test results, it is found that the blackout, which is caused by a short circuit at the DC side of ESS, can be prevented by selecting the proper power fuse. The power fuse selection, in turn, is based on the proposed graphic solution method that operates the power fuse ahead of ASS."

However, it is a common thing that the group overwhelms the individual. In this case, the excuse ‘for we all’ can easily arise, but it is not always right. Especially if it is emphasized as ‘good’, it can be accepted uncritically by people. This will make good narrow. Here, we look at the narrowness of good from two aspects: completeness and homogeneity. Completeness can be said to be revealed in trying to unite the values pursued by an individual with absolute-collective- truth or order. Homogeneity is related to the tendency to find the attributes of truth or order in harmony within a group. In this study, based on objectivism, I will criticize the narrowness of good and a seek a new model. Objectivism aims to achieve goals based on rationality and to affirm self-esteem. This ideal of an ethical individual shown by objectivism can provide the motivation to transform into a human being who creates goodness and practices it in their own lives, rather than being subordinated to goodness."

In the introduction, learners are identified before the full-scale discussion activities are conducted, the perception of speech is transformed, and basic knowledge related to speech is learned. In the development, discussion topics are shared and group talks or mini-talks are conducted to inspire the atmosphere of the discussion. In development, results are derived while intensive discussions on the subject, and questions and answers are conducted for each group. The contents of the discussion are then summarized and presented, and questions and responses from all colleagues are received as well as evaluation. At the conclusion, the discussion activities are finalized and the evaluation of the discussion activities as well as the significance of the discussion classes are reviewed.Third, the effect of speaking learning through discussion class was reviewed. Discussion classes are part of group speaking. Because of such characteristics, discussion classes can have various effects. Because all learners must participate, motivation for learning and a sense of accomplishment for learning can be encouraged. On the other hand, not only can you develop a self-directed learning attitude in the process of expressing opinions and finding good solutions, but you can also coordinate opinions with multiple people and develop communication skills. Moreover, since learners from various departments gat her and share opinions, the importance of collective intelligence can be recognized, and based on this, convergent thinking skills and comprehensive judgment can be improved.Fourth, there is no problem that must be decided in advance for the discussion class to proceed as intended. In order to increase the educational effect of the discussion class, the number of enrolled students should be reduced, and space for group discussions should be secured. In addition, because of the nature of the discussion class, qualitative evaluation rather than quantitative evaluation takes up a large proportion, so it may be better to choose the absolute evaluation method. In addition, rather than transferring knowledge and information, teachers need to be familiar with the purpose, method, and content of the discussion class so that learners can learn while thinking on their own."
북한강유역 낙랑계토기의 변천과 전개 양상,2021,"['낙랑계토기', '북한강유역', '원삼국시대', '취락', '변천 양상', 'Lelang-type pottery', 'Bukhan River basin', 'Proto-Three Kingdoms Period', 'Settlement', 'Aspects of development']","본고는 북한강유역 낙랑계토기의 변천 양상을 파악하는 데 일차적 목적이 있다. 그리고 지역별로 그 전개 양상을 살펴보고, 나아가 낙랑계토기가 나타나던 시기의 북한강유역 물질문화의 흐름을 분기별로 파악해 보았다. 먼저 변천 양상을 파악하기 위해 북한강유역 낙랑계토기는 시간이 지남에 따라 서북한지역 낙랑토기에서 나타나는 특징들이 점차 옅어지면서 독자적 변화 과정을 거쳤을 것이라 가정하였다. 이에 낙랑토기에서 확인되는 특징적 속성들을 우선적으로 검토하고, 낙랑계토기에서 나타나는 유의미한 속성들을 통해 기종별로 분류 기준을 세워 형식을 설정하였다. 그리고 북한강유역에서 나타나는 물질문화상의 특징적 변화들을 기준으로 단계를 구성하고, 단계별로 낙랑계토기 기종과 형식들을 살펴보았다. 그 결과 낙랑토기 제작기법은 늦은 단계까지 지속되지만 단계적으로 형태·양식적 측면에서 변형이 이루어지는 과정을 볼 수 있었다. 그러나 몇몇 기종과 형식은 단계별로 새롭게 출현하거나 낙랑토기의 영향이 강하게 남아 있는데 이는 서북한지역과의 지속적 교류에 따라새롭게 등장한 낙랑계토기로 이해된다. 또한 평저호와 타날문단경호는 형식 변화가 단계적으로 뚜렷하게 나타나기에 이를 중심으로 낙랑계토기 단계별 변천안의 큰 틀을 설정하였고, 기타 기종들을 단계 안에 위치시킴으로써 북한강유역 낙랑계토기 변천안을 제시하였다. 다음으로 본고에서 설정한 변천안을 토대로 지역별 낙랑계토기의 전개 양상을 살펴보았다. 그결과 춘천 지역 취락에서 기원후 1세기 어느 시점에 낙랑계토기가 출현한 이후 2세기에 이르러 주변 지역으로 점차 확산된 것으로 보았다. 낙랑계토기 변천 마지막 단계에 이르러 북한강유역 전역에서 낙랑계토기가 확인되는 가운데 가평 대성리 유적, 홍천 태학리 유적 등으로 대표되는 대규모취락들이 각지에서 출현 또는 성장하였던 것으로 보았다. 낙랑계토기의 변천과 전개 양상, 그리고단계 구분에서의 표지자료를 통해 북한강유역 물질문화의 분기를 Ⅰ기와 Ⅱ-1기, Ⅱ-2기로 나누고각 시기별로 그 내용을 살펴보았다. 이를 통해 낙랑계토기 단계별 변화 및 전개 과정과 기존 편년연구를 통해 알려진 물질문화상의 변화가 상호 연동되어 나아가는 일련의 흐름을 짚어볼 수 있었다","The primary purpose of this paper is understanding the development of Lelang-type pottery in settlements in the Bukhan River basin. In addition, I examined the development of Lelang-type pottery by region, and furthermore, identified the flow of material culture in the Bukhan River basin during the period when the pottery first appeared. First, to understand the aspects of development, I assumed that Lelang-type pottery in the Bukhan River basin went through its own changes as the characteristics of Lelang pottery in the western North Korea region gradually faded over time. Thus, I examined the characteristic properties identified in Lelang pottery and set up models by establishing classification criteria for each type through the significant properties found in Lelang-type pottery. In addition, I constructed the phases based on characteristic changes in material culture in the Bukhan River basin, and looked at the types and models of Lelang-type pottery phase-by-phase. As a result, I could see the making techniques of Lelang-type pottery lasting until late phases, but being transformed in terms of form and style by phase. However, some types and models were newly introduced by phase or strongly influenced by Lelang pottery, which were understood as a newly emerged Lelang-type potteries due to continuous exchanges with the western North Korea region. Also, the changes of the Flat-bottomed Jar and the Beating- Patterned, Short-Necked Jar were more clearly identified than other models. Therefore, I proposed an idea how Lelang-type pottery in the Bukhan River basin was developed by focusing on the changes of the two models and positioning other models within the phase. Next, I looked at the development of Lelang-type pottery by region based on the idea set by this study. As a result, it was believed that Lelang-type pottery appeared at some point in the 1st century A.D. in Chuncheon region and gradually spread to neighboring areas in the 2nd century. While Lelang-type pottery was identified throughout the Bukhan River basin at the last phase of the development, I understood that large-scale settlements like Daeseong-ri site in Gapyeong or Taehak-ri site in Hongcheon had appeared or grown in various regions. Through the changes, aspects of development, and markers used for phase division, I divided the divergence of the material culture in the Bukhan river basin into Phase Ⅰ, Phase Ⅱ-1, and Phase Ⅱ-2, and examined it phase-by-phase. As a result, it was possible to point out a series of flows in which the phase-by-phase development of Lelang-type pottery and the changes in material culture known through existing polarization studies are being interconnected."

Urban acupuncture provides another development strategy, trying to make the continuation of the original texture and the overall development of the city simultaneously. Urban acupuncture has no strict definition and universal standard model. It is a city development strategy with rich connotation and open denotation, and has quite a variety of interpretations and understandings. The idea of Manuel de Sola-Morales provides inspiration for this paper. Based on diverse literature from South Korea, Europe and China, street sculpture is found, from the perspective of culture and environment, to be used as urban catalyst to catalyze the regional development potential and influence urban regeneration. Through the research, we can find that the focus of the research and practice of urban regeneration and urban acupuncture from the perspective of environment is still the transformation of buildings and regions, the upgrading of public infrastructure, the optimization of public space and road traffic; the focus of the research and practice of urban regeneration and urban acupuncture from the perspective of culture is also very important Macro, mainly urban design. Therefore, this study boldly combines the urban acupuncture with the sculpture standing in the street, and advocates that the key acupoints of the street should be selected through sculpture for small-scale intervention or micro implantation. This paper attempts to refine the concepts of Acupuncture of sculpture and micro implantation of sculpture under the framework of urban regeneration. At the same time, it also tries to point out the new direction of urban regeneration. At the same time, it also provides some reference for the practice of urban regeneration."

This game induces the emotional identification between players and the character through various audio-visual effects. Therefore, it successfully forming a large base of fanatical fans. The identification of the adventure of the character in this game is closely related to the actual experiences of the players. Additionally, the adventure is not only a process of fighting with enemies in the outside world, but also a process of overcoming the past and the self-realization. From this point, the game would not only change the character, but also the player’s sense of identification. In the present article, the storyline of “Senua’s Sacrifice” was firstly analyzed using the structure of hero mythology. Secondly, the meaning gained by the players through the experience of the game story by trans-identity was also confirmed. The concept of trans-identity is based on the premise that most of the stories accepted and loved by the public are always storylines centered on the transformation process of the character’s identification. In addition, the criticism based on the concept of trans-identity has two basic advances. It based on how the transformation of the character’s identification can be achieved-reversal, transposition, traverse, transcendence and other different types to grasp the different direction of the storyline. Additionally, it also based on the different viewpoints from the existing value center evaluates and objectively analyzes the merits of the storyline. As a psychological adventure game, “Senua’s Sacrifice” shows a strong narrative. It reproduces the monomyth of departure-initiation-return. Additionally, the character undergo the reversal-crossing-beyond growth of trans-identity. The ideal story of the game transcends the pure use model. It induces people to experience the hero mythology itself. It is a process of trans-identity that constantly brings tension to the storyline and strengthens the psychological contradictions. Besides, this trans-identity story connects the auditory hallucinations and hallucinations experienced by the players during the game with the enhancement of their narrative experience. Although the players maintains a narrative distance when they first start the game, they will gradually feel the same as the character and gradually become homogeneous. The experience of trans-identity that shuttles back and forth between the inescapable hallucinations and the clear understanding of reality, combined with the player’s experience of devotion to the game and narrative distance, forms a stronger sense of immersion. As a result, in the storyline of a psychological action adventure game, trans-identity cross reflects not only the spiritual growth of the character, but also strengthens the players’ input to the character and the functional elements of unity."

Therefore, 2020 can be called the “first year of criminal compliance” in China. In 2021, China further expanded the pilot scope of enterprise criminal compliance reform. Which procuratorate led criminal compliance reform model can be copied and promoted? How to construct a set of criminal compliance system with Chinese characteristics? This is an academic topic worth observing and thinking, and it also has important practical significance. Different from the “legal person independent responsibility + deferred prosecution agreement (DPA)” model in Britain and the United States and the “legal representative responsibility + judicial agreement based on public interest (CJIP)” model in France. From the perspective of procedural law, Chinese academic circles have put forward the transformation mode of directly learning from the agreement mode of suspension of prosecution, the lenient system mode of pleading guilty and punishment, and the conditional non prosecution system; From the perspective of substantive law, it puts forward the phased transformation mode of unit crime system and the pre-set mode of criminal compliance obligation. However, these modes have the limitations that the thought of criminal integration is not fully implemented. On the other hand, Chinese judicial circles have explored the following criminal compliance modes: the system mode of legal interest restoration investigation period, “relative non prosecution + procuratorial advice” mode, the whole process criminal compliance supervision mode, “independent supervisor + compliance specialist” mode, and the “enterprise + entrepreneur” criminal Compliance Investigation Mode. Although these models have their own characteristics and make a breakthrough in the criminal compliance system model of western countries, they all have the problem of insufficient legitimacy and scientificity to varying degrees. In essence, the construction of criminal compliance is a profound revolution in crime governance. To creatively transform the enterprise compliance concept originated in western countries in combination with China’s national conditions, so as to explore the criminal compliance system with Chinese characteristics, it is necessary to critically learn from the experience of South Korea, Britain and other countries, strengthen systematic governance, legal governance, comprehensive governance and source governance, and pay attention to science and technology to support governance innovation, Better transform the institutional advantages into the effectiveness of crime governance, including enterprise crime."

Various machine learning techniques were applied to the model in consideration of the transformation characteristics of offshore waves while propagating into the harbour. Pohang New Port was selected for model application, which had a serious problem of unloading due to swell and has lots of available wave data. Wave height, wave period, and wave direction at offshore sites and wave heights inside the harbour were used for the model input and output, respectively, and then the model was trained using deep learning method.

It is the subject of a very important comparative constitutional unification study. In the current situation of South and North Korea, where different systems aiming for unification still coexist, what kind of joint legal agreement must South Korea go through in order to achieve unification with North Korea? In its decision on the German Basic Treaty (Grundlagenvertrag), the German Federal Constitutional Court clearly suggested the possibility of introducing the Konföderation through various international legal transformations step by step. In this regard, the Federal Constitutional Court ruled that such a union of states is, for example, in international law according to the example of the German Federation of 1815 (völkerrechtliche Staatenverbindung). The escalation of tensions between the two Koreas due to the North Korean nuclear test is making the relationship between South and North Korea more complex and unpredictable. In this current situation, how can the South Korean government overcome these problems and develop a model for unification that enables South and North Korea to contact each other in a peaceful state again? In this regard, they are trying to find the answer in the European Union model while designing the Korean Commonwealth. Marlene Wind classifies the concept of flexibility that is not new in the process of European integration, but already existed in the process of confirmation of the European Community in 1972, 1981, 1986, and 1995, into the following three types: ① Classical variable speed A type of flexibility as a multi-speed provision, ② a variable geometry model, and ③ a position in favor of the formation of a still less integrated European Community. A lot of research and analysis should be done on which concept of flexibility to apply in the process of Korean unification among the various forms of flexibility discussed in the process of European integration. The reality in Europe where the previous European Constitutional Treaty was rejected and the current situation in the UK where the Brexit decision was made raises new concerns about which type of flexibility to choose in the process of European integration. In relation to the criticism of the concept of flexibility, it is hoped that the North-South model of the European Union system will not be used as an excuse to justify the current situation in South and North Korea that cannot do this or that.Beyond these criticisms, the formation of a unified community between South Korea and North Korea can proceed well only when we try to change North Korea based on the most basic problem awareness that the path of a thousand miles begins with one step, and then move forward on a path of cooperation with North Korea. Therefore, in order to properly apply the discussion on community formation raised in the context of the EU level based on the concept of flexibility to our discussion of unification, more analysis and research, serious reflection on our reality, and improvement of the situation in which the problem is raised I think that efforts should be made in advance. In its decision on the German Basic Treaty (Grundlagenvertrag), the German Federal Constitutional Court clearly suggested the possibility of introducing the Konföderation through various international legal transformations step by step.

The curved beam material and elastic foundation are assumed to be lossless Bernoulli-Euler beam theory including a tension force(T), damping coefficient (C) and stiffness of foundation(κ2) will be employed. The expression for sound power is integrated numerically and the results examined as a function of Mach number(M), wave-number ratio(γ) and stiffness factor(ψ). The experimental investigation for structure vibration noise of vehicle tire under the action of random moving line forces has been made. Based on the STSF(Spatial Transformation of Sound Field) techniques, the sound power and sound radiation are measured.

To achieve the maximum effectiveness of the research investments, it is necessary to evaluate its funding’s worth and default risk. Thus, incorporating the concepts of the Black-Scholes-Merton model and the Greeks, this study develops a default-risk evaluation model in the foundation of a system dynamics methodology. By utilizing the proposed model, this study estimates the monetary worth and the default risks of research funding in the public and private sectors of Information and Communication technologies, along with the sensitivity of the R&D economic worth of research funding to changes in a given parameter. This study finds that the public sector has more potential than the private sector in terms of monetary worth and that the default risks of three types of research funding are relatively high. Through a sensitivity analysis, the results indicate that uncertainty in volatility, operation period, and a risk-free interest rate has trivial impacts on the monetary worth of research funding, while volatility has large impacts on the default risk among the uncertain factors."

Finite Element Analysis of the Effects of Process and Material Parameters on the LVDT Output Characteristics,2021,"['LVDT(선형가변차동변압기)', 'Output Characteristic(출력 특성)', 'Supply Power(공급 전원)', 'Core Material(코어 재질)', 'Finite Element Analysis(유한요소해석)']",,"Linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) is a displacement sensor and is commonly used owing to its wide measurement range, excellent linearity, high sensitivity, and precision. To improve the output characteristics of LVDT, a few studies have been conducted to analyze the output using a theoretical method or a finite element method. However, the material properties of the core and the electromagnetic force acting on the core were not considered in the previous studies. In this study, a finite element analysis model was proposed considering the characteristics of the LVDT composed of coils, core, magnetic shell and electric circuit, and the core displacement. Using the proposed model, changes in sensitivity and linear region of LVDT according to changes in process and material parameters were analyzed. The outputs of the LVDT model were compared with those of the theoretical analysis, and then, the proposed analysis model was validated. When the electrical conductivity of the core was high and the relative magnetic permeability was low, the decrease in sensitivity was large. Additionally, an increase in the frequency of the power led to further decrease in sensitivity. The electromagnetic force applied on the core increased as the voltage increased, the frequency decreased, and the core displacement increased."

In addition, there is a deflection problem that focuses on the beginning of the document in mechanical summarization. Therefore, these methods are not suitable for documents with flows such as fairy tales and novels.

Neuro-fuzzy fatigue life assessment using the wavelet-based multifractality parameters,2021,['· Neuro-fuzzy · Fatigue life · Wavelet transform · Multifractal · Durability'],,"This study aims to establish a fatigue life predictive model based on multifractality of road excitations using neuro-fuzzy method to assess the durability of suspension spring.Traditional durability analysis in time domain is complicated and time-consuming due to the needs of large data amount. Thus, it is an idea to adopt an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for relating the performance of coil spring to the multifractal properties of road excitations, giving a meaningful fatigue life prediction. Different membership function numbers were tested to obtain the optimum membership function number. During the data training process, the checking data was used to test the trained model each Epoch of training for overfitting detection. As a result, the Morrow-based fatigue life prediction model was found to give the most suitable result with three membership functions. The SWT-based model needed five membership functions due to nonlinear properties in the SWT-based fatigue life data. Training process of Morrow-based-ANFIS was stopped at Epoch 8 given its lowest checking root-meansquare-error of 0.6953. SWT-based model recorded a higher error of 0.7940. The neuro-fuzzy models gave accurate fatigue life predictions with 96 % of the data distributed within the acceptance boundary, hence, contributing to an acceptable assessment of coil spring fatigue life based on load multifractality. This study had shown a nonlinear relationship between road multifractality and durability performance of coil spring. Multifractality had been proven an important feature to characterise various road excitations for durability prediction."
A restorable autoencoder as a method for dimensionality reduction,2021,['Autoencoder · Dimensionality reduction · Principal component analysis · Linear transformation'],,"In this paper, we propose a restorable autoencoder model as a non-linear method for reducing dimensionality. While nonlinear methods can reduce the dimensionality of data more effectively than linear methods, they are, in general, not able to restore the original data from the dimensionality-reduced result. This is because non-linear methods provide a non-linear relationship between the original data and their dimensionality-reduced result. With the advantages of both linear and nonlinear methods, the proposed model not only maintains an effective dimensionality reduction but also provides an observationwise linear relationship with which the original data can be restored from the dimensionality-reduced result. We assessed the effectiveness of the proposed model and compared it with the linear method of principal component analysis and the non-linear methods of typical autoencoders using MNIST and Fashion-MNIST data sets. We demonstrated that the proposed model was more effective than or comparable to the compared methods in terms of the loss function and the reconstruction of input images. We also showed that the lower-dimensional projection obtained by the proposed model produced better or comparable classification results than that by the compared methods."

Furthermore, this paper performs modeling of ESS based on PSCAD/EMTDC, which is composed of 3-phase power supply system including circuit breaker and interconnected transformer, PCS(power control system) and battery system. From the simulation results based on the proposed modeling, it is confirmed that secondary voltage of interconnected transformer for ESS can be rapidly increased due to the ferro-resonance phenomenon in L-C series and series-parallel combination circuits and then the battery system may be severely affected by such rapid over-voltage. And also, it is confirmed that the proposed prevention algorithm of ferro-resonance can contribute to stable operation of ESS by installing optimal capacity of filter in PCS."

탄소중립은 지속가능한 경제성장과 양립하는가?,2021,"['탄소중립 정책', '경제성장 모형', '자본스톡', '지속가능 경제성장', 'Carbon neutral policy', 'Economic growth model', 'Capital stock', 'Sustainable growth']",,"Carbon neutral policy in Korea pays limited attention to the concept of sustainable economic growth. This limitation can be compared with other countries' carbon neutral policies such as US, UK and China where the climate change policies are closely connected to economic policies to boost further economic growth. This paper adopts a Ramsey growth model to account for the impact of carbon neutral policy on long-term economic growth and the accumulation capital. The model incorporates the Hartwick rule to allow sustainability of economic growth by transforming resource input into other input factor for growth. The analysis provides a possibility of low accumulation of capital as a result of carbon neutral policy in the absence of effective transformation of fossil-fuel factor into growth-related productive capital. Such low capital stock can be more aggravated when there exists a rent-seeking behavior of various interest groups with voracity to exploit social capital."

This investigation employed novel two-stage hybrid paradigm (i.e., wavelet-based gated recurrent unit, wavelet-based generalized regression neural networks, and wavelet-based random forests) to predict BOD concentration in the Dosan and Hwangji stations, South Korea. These models were assessed with the corresponding independent models (i.e., gated recurrent unit, generalized regression neural networks, and random forests). Diverse water quality and quantity indicators were implemented for developing independent and two-stage hybrid models based on several input combinations (i.e., Divisions 1-5). The addressed models were evaluated using three statistical indices including the root mean square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and correlation coefficient (CC). It can be found from results that the two-stage hybrid models cannot always enhance the predictive precision of independent models confidently. Results showed that the DWT-RF5 (RMSE = 0.108 mg/L) model provided more accurate prediction of BOD concentration compared to other optimal models in Dosan station, and the DWT-GRNN4 (RMSE = 0.132 mg/L) model was the best for predicting BOD concentration in Hwangji station, South Korea."
Pattern Classification for Small-Sized Defects Using Multi-Head CNN in Semiconductor Manufacturing,2021,['Automatic defect classification (ADC) · Convolutional neural network (CNN) · Modified median filtering · Rotated defects (RoD) transform'],,"To improve the quality of semiconductor manufacturing, defects need to be detected and their root causes controlled. Because the root causes can vary depending on defect patterns, classifying the patterns accurately is important. Several recent studies have investigated automatic defect classification using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with wafer map images. CNNs are excellent tools for classifying images of different shapes and sizes. However, the detection of small-sized defects that have small clusters and linear patterns is difficult. Therefore, this study focuses on patterns that are difficult to detect. We propose three steps for pattern classification. First, modified median filtering is used to preserve the original shapes of patterns. Second, a rotated defects (RoD) transform is performed by applying the rotational properties of wafer maps. The RoD transform augments the defect proportion and improves the detection of small-sized defects. Third, a multi-head CNN is used to extract and combine the features from the original and transformed maps. The combined features are then used to classify the defect patterns. Overall classification performance of defects can be improved by accurately classifying small clusters and linear patterns. The proposed model was evaluated using WM-811K wafer maps, and small-sized defects were accurately classified. Such an accurate defect classification model will enable effective root cause analysis and quality improvement in semiconductor manufacturing."

The origins of modern DE are traced to the need for and likely problems with the industrialization of eastern Europe in post-WWII. Then, economists turned their concern toward Asia, Latin America and Africa. The characteristics of DE can be summarized as follows: ⑴ complex development problems were treated too simply and optimistically; ⑵ early theories based on the trickle-down effect of economic growth, neglected the distributional phase of economic development; and ⑶ benefit from the fruits of economic growth is not automatically distributed to the low-income class. The loophole in early DE has neglected to identify the correlation between growth and poverty, but it should be acknowledged that economic growth has contributed to eradicating absolute poverty. Every thing looked bleak on the eve of Korea’s journey into uncharted water in a search for economic development in 1961. New regime determined to take a more active role in the management of national economy. Economic policy emphasis suddenly shifted from that of dependency on the U.S. aid to that of a more self-reliant economy, and from inward looking and import substituting(IS) to outward looking and export promoting(EP). The striking features of Korean economic development are government-led discriminatory industrial policy, outward-looking policy, general incentive structures favoring high-performing agents, dominance of big business, coexistence of IS and EP, strategic changes in comparative advantage, policy-directed loans to business through a tight nexus of government, banks and business, factor distortion, use of scale economies, entrepreneurship, and the New Community Movement(Saemaul Undong). evaluation and feedback to the next phase. Using five propositions, Park Chung Hee model explains the transition from backward economy to an industrial economy. Central to the model is ‘human capital with a roadmap for development’ led by a capable leader."

Saemaul Undong had adopted a discriminative incentive policy rule defined as economic discrimination(ED) that helps only those villages helping themselves based on their actual performances. It had successfully driven Korea’s now well-known development miracle by transforming virtually 30 million people of all towns in Korea into people with a self-helping mindset within a short ten years from 1970 to 79. The Saemaul Undog turns out to be the pathfinder for modern-day behavioral and experimental economics. In this regard, The RCT is not comparable to Saemaul Undong regarding originality, scale, and achievement.The paper then presents the sustainable model of rural development for poverty alleviation based on the Saemaul Undong experience and a general theory of economic development by this author. This model specifies the holy trinity of rural development; the markets consisting of rural households, the village organizations managed by the village leaders playing the role of entrepreneur, and the government, that need to work concertedly to set and enforce the ED rule. In addition, the government needs to supplement the formal ED rule with self-help mindset education for motivation and continuously allocate rural infrastructure and cash-generating projects to be undertaken by the individual villages according to the ED policy rule.Finally, the paper argues that Korea’s experiences of successful economic development, including rural development, had been a test-bed for this model and amounts to confirm its empirical validation. The paper concludes that the Saemaul Undong policy and the theory behind it may be more than enough to merit the Nobel Economics Award."

Next, a sliding mode controller (SMC) was designed to maintain robust control performance and control accuracy for the VSRS. Especially, SMC with optimal switching hyper-plane was designed by applying the optimal control principle to minimize variation of target state variable near the sliding surface. Finally, some computer simulations and real experiments for the VSRS were conducted to verify the validity of the suggested SMC. Results showed that the suggested SMC had strong robustness against model uncertainty and disturbance.

From this, we want to check long-term neutrality by testing whether there is a partial trend consisting of the cointegration and the shock of the nominal variable. This approach has the advantage of avoiding the bias of omitted variable bias because it can add an error of cointegration compared to the analysis VAR model of existing studies, which consists of the difference between real and nominal variables. As a result of empirical analysis of Korean data in the period after the Asian financial crisis, hypotheses such as long-term neutrality of money and the long-term vertical Phillips curve were rejected at the 5% significance level."

In class, students learn various physical manufacturing methods, and it takes time and effort. From a practical point of view, it was determined that virtual reality was appropriate as a way to practice modeling, and an research plan was established. As research methods, literature review, experimental design and implementation, questionnaire survey, and group discussion were conducted. First, the characteristics of 3D formative in the design major were examined, and the relationship between form and function was summarized. After examining the content arrangement principles to enhance the spatiality of virtual reality, some of the 3D modeling outputs were made into virtual content so that the students could experience their design. In virtual reality, students could walk directly into the virtual space where their design model is placed, so they could recognize and experience the relative size of the modeling based on themselves, which made them easily imagine the practicality of the modeling work. In addition, they were able to experiment with various possibilities by making modifications as they imagined on the screen and immediately experiencing the results. Students had many positive opinions that the virtual reality experiences were excellent in immersion and that the scale transformation and implementation of the modeling were easy. In addition, it was evaluated as a good tool to raise interest in the task and propose various modeling concepts. Through this study, it is expected that it will be possible to provide a basis for raising the level of the 3D formative class by proposing a practical imagination training method using the characteristics of virtual reality."

The scheme suggests two frameworks which are customized spatial structure and scenario based planning as a alternative model for the new park. The first model of customization replaces the zoning methods for park design. It enables users to easily recompose spaces and programs of the park according to their needs. The second model, scenario based planning is an alternative of the classic phasing strategy. It is an planning method consisting of diverse spatial alternatives that are derived from the standard prototype structure to deal with future uncertainties. The design scheme proposes a new decentralized park structure closely integrated with the city blurring the boundary as adopting new urban design trends in to park design. This study not only proposes a design solution for the specific site but also searches a new potential of practical theory to overcome the limits of both existing park design models pursuing intrinsic completeness and time based process."
"Influences of Latent Heat on Temperature Field, Weld Bead Dimensions and Melting Efficiency During Welding Simulation",2021,['Finite element method · Latent heat · Submerged arc welding · Melting efficiency · Welding simulation'],,"The present study aims to evaluate the influence of latent heat effect during phase change in a three-dimensional finite elementnumerical simulation of arc welding. A mathematical model is developed to incorporate the effect of latent heat ofphase transformation using enthalpy formulation. The accuracy of the developed model was initially validated using availableresults in the literature and found consistent prediction. The validated numerical model is used to predict the temperaturedistribution, weld width, depth of penetration, melting efficiency with and without incorporating the effect of latent heat offusion, solidification vaporization. The results obtained from a developed model incorporating the latent heat effect are ingood agreement with the experimentally measured values, whereas a considerable deviation is observed between the predictedvalues and experimental values without considering the effect of latent heat. It is found that without considering the latentheat effect in the model, the mean error is 14%, 24.6%, 22% and 29.6% for peak temperatures, weld width, depth of penetrationand melting efficiency respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that the effect of latent heat of fusion, solidification,and vaporization is significant for analysis involving phase change and must be accounted for during numerical simulations."

Transformed hairy roots of A. annua expressing anaPCS gene showed better tolerance to heavy metals, viz., arsenic (As) and cadmium (Cd) owing to 143 and 191% more As- and Cd-accumulation, respectively, as compared to normal roots with a bioconcentration factor (BCF) of 9.7 and 21.1 for As and Cd, respectively.Under As and Cd stresses, transformed hairy roots possessed signifcantly higher amounts of phytochelatins and thiols probably due to the presence of both AaPCS (Artemisia annua PCS) and anaPCS. In addition, artemisinin synthesis was also induced in transformed hairy roots under heavy metals stresses. In-silico analysis revealed the presence of conserved motifs in both AaPCS and anaPCS sequences as well as structural modelling of PCS functional domain was conducted. Interaction of AaPCS and anaPCS proteins with CdCl2 and sodium arsenate gene ontology analysis gave insights to anaPCS function ing in transformed hairy roots of A. annua.

This study deals with the seat allocation problem that is the traditional one in the revenue management problem of high-speed trains. Traditional railway operators have provided different fares depending on cabin types. The seats of the train have been recognized as a perishable asset, which can not generate any value from the remaining after a certain time. In service industries with perishable assets including airlines and hotels, it is common to offer different fares depending on the usage restrictions for maximizing revenue from the maximum use of their assets. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce multiple fares depending on the difference in usage restrictions in the high-speed railway systems.In this paper, we are focused on the problem of seat allocation with multiple fares including quantity discount fares for each itinerary in high-speed railway systems. We will develope an optimization model for our problem. Due to the demand uncertainty, the model can be formulated as a non-linear stochastic programming model for maximizing the expected revenue from the operation of the single high-speed train. With some assumption on the demand distribution and applying the linear approximation techniques developed by Szwac, the model can be transformed to the integer programming model which can be solved easily with commercial solvers such as CLPEX and LINDO. In order to explore the practical applicability of our model, a simple example for the seat assignment in the train operation is tested. From the simple test, we can find that our model can effectively obtain the seat allocation results by the optimal solution using the existing commercial optimization software without any special algorithm even in the real world high-speed rail operations.In the domestic railway system, the rail operators offer only a price discrimination according to the schedule. However, it is proved that the multiple fares depending on the usage restriction increase the possibility of customer choice as well as the profitability of the rail operators. Therefore, it is necessary to employ the multiple fare system in the domestic rail operators for the profitability as well as the customer benefit. This study has dealt with the seat allocation problem of high-speed rail, but it is only one of the research issues addressed in the railway revenue management problem. There are still many research issues on railway revenue management issues such as multiple trains, customer transits during the journey, and stopping station of trains. We hope that this study can contribute to expanding various research issues on high-speed railway revenue management issues."
Line Drawing Mobile App using Hybrid Approach,2021,"['image-to-image translation', 'style transfer', 'line drawing', 'deep neural networks', 'image segmentation', 'edge detection']",,"In recent years, image-to-image translation(I2I) has drawn much attention and shown noticeable success in many areas such as image synthesis, segmentation, style transfer, restoration, and pose estimation. Among these applications, the line drawing model, which is a subfield of style transfer, transforms any portrait picture into a line drawing. In these days, line drawing apps are very popular among young people. The most common feature of the current model is to delicately display all lines as if sketched with a pencil. Because of this, not only are the results not natural, but they are also less aesthetically interesting. In this paper, we design and implement a light and fast hybrid line drawing model which combines deep neural networks and traditional edge detection filter. We show that proposed model is efficient and outputs more aesthetically pleasing results."
Automatic Classification of the Korean Triage Acuity Scale in Simulated Emergency Rooms Using Speech Recognition and Natural Language Processing: a Proof of Concept Study,2021,"['Triage', 'Classification', 'Machine Learning', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Deep Learning']",,"Background: Rapid triage reduces the patients' stay time at an emergency department (ED). The Korean Triage Acuity Scale (KTAS) is mandatorily applied at EDs in South Korea.For rapid triage, we studied machine learning-based triage systems composed of a speech recognition model and natural language processing-based classification.Methods: We simulated 762 triage cases that consisted of 18 classes with six types of the main symptom (chest pain, dyspnea, fever, stroke, abdominal pain, and headache) and three levels of KTAS. In addition, we recorded conversations between emergency patients and clinicians during the simulation. We used speech recognition models to transcribe the conversation.Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) were used for KTAS and symptom classification. Additionally, we evaluated the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values of features to interpret the classifiers.Results: The character error rate of the speech recognition model was reduced to 25.21% through transfer learning. With auto-transcribed scripts, support vector machine (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81–0.9), KNN (AUROC, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.85–0.93), RF (AUROC, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.82–0.9) and BERT (AUROC, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.75–0.87) achieved excellent classification performance.Based on SHAP, we found “stress”, “pain score point”, “fever”, “breath”, “head” and “chest” were the important vocabularies for determining KTAS and symptoms.Conclusion: We demonstrated the potential of an automatic KTAS classification system using speech recognition models, machine learning and BERT-based classifiers."
수량할인을 포함하는 여정기반의 항공사 수익경영 문제,2021,"['Itinerary Demand', 'Quantity Discount', 'Revenue Management', 'Seat Assignment', 'Booking Control', 'Linear Approximation technique']",,"Revenue Management problems have been studied widely and actively in airlines for many decades, especially focusing on a seat assignment problem, a booking control problem and a dynamic pricing problem. Traditionally, most of seat revenue management problems in airlines have focused on the seat assignment and booking control for one-way flight. However, most booking requests for air travel are occurred a round-trip basis. In the traditional model, the round trip itinerary was divided into two one-way itineraries independently and the seat assignment problem based on the each itinerary demand has been studied individually. The traditional RM approach is no longer suitable for managing seat assignments and booking controls on round trip itineraries. Furthermore, it is common to travel in small groups rather than individuals, and airlines may consider offering discount fares (quantity discount fares) for such groups which can be found in many retail shopping and recognized to induce more demand. In this paper, we deal with the itinerary based revenue management problem focusing on the seat assignment and booking control with quantity discount fares. Our problem has not been studied effectively in the previous researches. We will suggest an optimization model and a greedy-type heuristic to determine the seat assignment for our complex problem. Based on the seat assignment solution, we will also suggest an effective booking control method to decide the acceptance or the rejection for a seat request. Even though the seat assignment model can be modeled as a probabilistic Integer programming model, we show it can be transformed to the simple Integer programming model by applying Linear Approximation technique. For itinerary-based booking control, we also suggest an effective mixed nesting control method. As a result of the simulation, we can find that our methods make more revenue gains (2.2%～5.1%) compared to the modified traditional ones. Expecially, when the demand is relatively high, the revenue gain is larger. In this study, we suggest some effective approach to solve the problem of seat assignment and booking allocation for itinerary-based demand with small groups, which has not been considered effectively so far. To enhance the applicability of our model in practice, it needs to develop more comprehensive models including diversions, no-shows and behavioral factors in air travelers."

Self-Supervised Rigid Registration for Small Images,2021,"['Rigid Registration', 'Self-Supervised Learning', 'Small Image', 'LSTM', 'Homography Estimation']",,"For small image registration, feature-based approaches are likely to fail as feature detectors cannot detect enough feature points from low-resolution images. The classic FFT approach’s prediction accuracy is high, but the registration time can be relatively long, about several seconds to register one image pair. To achieve real-time and high-precision rigid registration for small images, we apply deep neural networks for supervised rigid transformation prediction, which directly predicts the transformation parameters. We train deep registration models with rigidly transformed CIFAR-10 images and STL-10 images, and evaluate the generalization ability of deep registration models with transformed CIFAR-10 images, STL-10 images, and randomly generated images. Experimental results show that the deep registration models we propose can achieve comparable accuracy to the classic FFT approach for small CIFAR-10 images (32×32) and our LSTM registration model takes less than 1ms to register one pair of images. For moderate size STL-10 images (96×96), FFT significantly outperforms deep registration models in terms of accuracy but is also considerably slower. Our results suggest that deep registration models have competitive advantages over conventional approaches, at least for small images."

On an abandoned quarry site in Sadang, Seoul, Republic of Korea, two different PV installation methods were analyzed. The first is attaching PV directly on the quarry slope. Since there are no corresponding safety standards and precedents for installing solar panels directly on slopes, the power generation potential was calculated by using topographic data and reasonable assumptions. The surface area of cut slope section was extracted from the Digital Elevation Model(DEM) via ArcGIS and Python programming to calculate the tilt and power capacity of installable panels. The other approach is installing PV as a rockfall barrier, and the power generation potential was analyzed with the assumption that the panel is installed in the direction of facing solar irradiation. For the derivation of power generation, the renewable energy generation analysis program SAM(System Advisor Model) was used for both methods. According to the result, quarries that have terminated resource extraction and remain devastated have the potential to be transformed into renewable energy generation sites."

Images and Imagination in Plato’s Republic and Sophist,2021,"['image', 'original', 'model', 'ideal', 'Form', 'Plato', 'sophist', 'Parmenides']",,"Images are familiar to us, but if asked what they are, philosophical difficulties emerge. This paper examines how Plato dealt with the difficulties concerning images.  Plato faced the basic question about the image because the Sophist insists that images do not exist, based on the Parmenidean prohibition of combination between what is and what is not, in the Sophist. This treatment of images should be considered along with the Republic because the Sophistic counterattack in the Sophist is closely related to the critical treatment of images in the Republic, and we can detect the Parmenidean backgrounds in these two dialogues.  In these dialogues, Plato treated the notion of the image in two ways. First, the image is not simply an inferior entity but a transforming factor. Images guide philosophical inquiry by visualising the target of discussion. Second, by distinguishing between true and false images, we can investigate the truth by means of the former. To consider the role that images play in philosophical inquiry, this paper discusses three examples: two are from the Republic and one is from the Sophist. Firstly, two opposite figures, one of the most just and the other of the most unjust, are presented by Glaucon in Republic II. They serve as a model of opposite personality for considering what justice and injustice are. Secondly, the Ideal City is depicted in words, in Republic V, as a model of the Form of justice. Thirdly, the Sophist of Noble Lineage, in the Sophist, shows that the same image appears differently to different observers. From an improper point of view, this person looked like a sophist at first, but at the final examination, it turned out to be a philosopher.  Thus, this paper shows the correct philosophical attitude towards images. If the Sophist rejects the existence of images and attempt to undo the distinctions between the original and the image and between true and false images, philosophical inquirers should prove the existence of images and try to distinguish between true and false images to contemplate the original, that is, reality. Thus, the correct use of images will make us philosophers."

The variables are coupled with the distributed magnetic flux density in the air gap instead of the magnetic inductance matrix while applying Kirchhoff’s law and Faraday’s induction law. Two calculated patterns for magnetic flux densities are necessary in the analysis.

Numerical Analysis on Crack Generation Behavior of Hypo Peritectic Steel in Continuous Casting Process,2021,['Hypo peritectic steel · Modeling · Possibility of crack generation · Strain rate · Volume contraction'],,"Hypo peritectic steels exhibit a high possibility of longitudinal crack during continuous casting. Therefore, many researchershave studied the mechanisms of crack generation in hypo peritectic steel. Stress in solidified shell, or volume contractionwith small liquid fractions were suggested as the mechanisms of crack generation. A new model was developed for predictingpossibility of crack generation by calculating strain rates in solid, volume contraction rate during solidification, and theprobability of liquid unfilling in continuous cooling processes. The results show that massive transformation from the δphase to the γ phase, and peritectic transformation during solidification can be the main crack generation mechanisms. Furthermore,a linear relationship exists between the amount of undercooling for peritectic transformation (dTp) and the carboncontent of the boundary for dividing the two crack generation mechanisms. Additionally, the longitudinal crack ratios ofthe field results are analyzed through strain rates in solid and liquid unfilling possibilities. Relative positions in the range ofhypo peritectic steel and effective carbon contents are suggested to analyze the crack ratio of steels with alloying elements.This analysis shows that the results obtained from the new models for crack generation possibility are usable, and dTpcangenerate the behavioral differences in crack generation according to the conditions."
Relationship Between Fluid Flow Stability and Submerged Entry Nozzle Port Angle in a Conventional Slab Continuous-Casting Mold,2021,['Continuous casting · Water model experiment · Oscillatory flow · Jet angle · Fast Fourier transform analysis'],,"Fluid flow patterns within a conventional slab continuous-casting mold are closely linked to the port angle of the submergedentry nozzle (SEN). Fluid flow is unstable below a certain port angle, with large fluctuations near the port outlet as wellas jet stream oscillation and repeated vortex formation and dissipation within the mold. However, such phenomena are notobserved above a certain port angle, at which the flow pattern becomes stable. This behavior was investigated via bothnumerical simulation and water model experimentation; two different regions were identified with flow patterns varyingaccording to the SEN port angle. In addition, a close quantitative relationship was identified between changes in the portangle and fluid velocity variations. For SEN port angles in the range 0°–15°, the flow velocity in the upper circulation zoneoscillated in an unstable manner. For port angles of 20° or more, the flow velocity of the same zone decreased significantlyand stabilized. When the gas was injected, the unstable region elongated to 0°–20°.

Although many sophisticated trackers have been successfully applied to track the object accurately, very few of them attaches importance to the scale and rotation estimation. In order to address the above limitation, we propose a novel method combined with Fourier-Mellin transform and confidence evaluation strategy for robust object tracking. In the first place, we construct a correlation filter to locate the target object precisely. Then, a log-polar technique is used in the Fourier-Mellin transform to cope with the rotation and scale changes. In order to achieve subpixel accuracy, we come up with an efficient surface fitting mechanism to obtain the optimal calculation result. In addition, we introduce a confidence evaluation strategy modeled on the output response, which can decrease the impact of image noise and perform as a criterion to evaluate the target model stability. Experimental experiments on OTB100 demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior capability in success plots and precision plots of OPE, which is 10.8% points and 8.6% points than those of KCF. Besides, our method performs favorably against the others in terms of SRE and TRE validation schemes, which shows the superiority of our proposed algorithm in scale and rotation evaluation."

Low-Complexity Super-Resolution Detection for Range-Vital Doppler Estimation FMCW Radar,2021,"['FFT', 'Low Complexity', 'MUSIC', 'Super-Resolution', 'Vital FMCW Radar']",,"This paper proposes low-complexity super-resolution detection for range-vital Doppler estimation frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar. In regards to vital radar, and in order to estimate joint range and vital Doppler information such as the human heartbeat and respiration, two-dimensional (2D) detection algorithms such as 2D-FFT (fast Fourier transform) and 2D-MUSIC (multiple signal classification) are required. However, due to the high complexity of 2D full-search algorithms, it is difficult to apply this process to low-cost vital FMCW systems. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the range and vital Doppler parameters by using 1D-FFT and 1D-MUSIC algorithms, respectively. Among 1D-FFT outputs for range detection, we extract 1D-FFT results based solely on human target information with phase variation of respiration for each chirp; subsequently, the 1D-MUSIC algorithm is employed to obtain accurate vital Doppler results. By reducing the dimensions of the estimation algorithm from 2D to 1D, the computational burden is reduced. In order to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, we compare the Monte Carlo simulation and root-mean-square error results. The simulation and experiment results show that the complexity of the proposed algorithm is significantly lower than that of an algorithm detecting signals in several regions."

Literature and art have especially preserved their connections by mutually exchanging the naturalistic forms that comes from the various imagery in each respective fields. Illustrated poetry and illustrations within literature are the most generally well-known forms that represent this transition. However, the ‘transformation of art genre’ that is referenced in this study is not referring to this simplistically direct recreation of a description into an art form. It is referring to the visualization that is created by the active involvement of the visual artists with the subject at hand being a work of literature. As supposed forms of art, literary works and visual arts fundamentally posses their own type of model, uniqueness, symbolism, and originality. Each work itself already has the characteristics of their respective art style, but with creation being the base of literary works, you can say that creation and superposition is carried out within the process of recreating these works into visual forms. The contact, citation, fusion, transition, change, recontextualization, reorganization, etc. that happens during the process of a visual artist recreating the inherent properties of a work of literature, like its attributes, values, symbols, message, etc, into a physical form goes through connection and expansion, understanding and interpretation, and development and abstraction. The various elements and respective points that occurs and are revealed during the process of art being added to art, in other words, literary content being recreated into a visual form, can be seen as the repository of creativity caused by the meeting of two artists. By examining this process, I will try to derive implications for creative exhibition planning."

In a world where humans and non-humans coexist, I looked at the ethic  of hospitality that helps post-humans, focusing on figures from the Martin-Penny family. Kim Cho-yeop's ""About My Space Hero"" depicts two female scientists becoming cyborgs, going beyond practical constraints with their subjective perception and courage. I consider that women can construct new role models with Kinnovating and the formation of new kinship, which is not limited to Western family systems.

In this paper I will explore the systems of Second-Personal Standpoint, especially by focusing on Stephen Darwall’s The Second-Person Standpoint theory(SPS), and explore possible ways to adapt his theory into legal theory. In the first section, I will provide a summary of Darwall’s second-personal standpoint theory. I will review his basic background premises including research intention, purpose and theoretical origin. And then I will look into his core concepts, main thesis. Lastly I will suggest three ways of interpretation and examine each. In the second section, I will flesh out Darwall’s theory on reason-giving as it relates to the Second-Personal Standpoint and provide several criticisms. In the third section, I will examine his account of moral obligation and his criticisms of the First-Personal Standpoint relating to moral obligation. And then I will take his claim into the legal context and evaluate the validity and desirability of it. In the fourth section, I will consider the scope of the Second-Personal Standpoint and look at arguments which might show that the Second-Personal Standpoint is weaker than Darwall presumed. Finally, I will discuss overall implications and limitations of admitting and adapting his second-personal Standpoint into legal theory in both perspective of moral and legal theory. This is a critical study on Darwall’s SPS, and I ultimately seek to design criterion to construct a model of second-personal jurisprudence."

In this paper, to solve the problem of determining the representative color information of a class, we propose a method to divide the color channel of HSV (Hue Saturation Value) and perform object-based classification. To this end, after transforming the input image of the RGB color space into the components of the HSV color space, the Hue component is divided into subchannels at regular intervals. The minimum distance-based image classification is performed for each hue subchannel, and the classification result is combined with the image segmentation result. As a result of applying the proposed method to KOMPSAT-3A imagery, the overall accuracy was 84.97% and the kappa coefficient was 77.56%, and the classification accuracy was improved by more than 10% compared to a commercial software."

The qp method is employed to avoid the singularity issue of stress-constrained problems. The P-norm function with stability transformation is adopted to build the global stress constraint with iterative corrections to eliminate the gap between the maximum local stress and the P-norm stress. The Heaviside projection is employed to generate clear-cut 0–1 designs. Two benchmark examples have been studied with the numerical algorithm. Experiments are performed on the topologically optimized MBB beam to investigate the impact of the FDM process parameters, including deposition path direction, building direction, and slicing layer height, on the resulted structural strength. The stress-constrained designs without and with Heaviside projection are comparatively tested with experiments. The stress-minimization designs subject to different P-norm parameters are compared both numerically and experimentally. Experiments show that the deposition path direction and the building direction evidently affect the derived structural strength. Moreover, overthin structural members may severely degrade the structural strength due to manufacturing and loading uncertainties."

Paul delivered the gospel exemplarily through contextualization so that Athenian citizens could understand the gospel as the language and concept used by those gathered in the square. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate that contextualization is essential and effective in evangelizing for missionary work. In addition, contextualization needs to be substantiated whether it should be recognized from a biblical concept, or a socio-cultural point of view in evangelism because...? This study examines the concept of contextualization through an exemplary case of apostle Paul, especially the gospel(Act 17), in which his words and actions were recorded in Athens, which means that contextualization focuses on the gospel being transformed or not mixed, and the message being delivered truly and efficiently. Therefore contextualization refers to a missionary theory and strategy on how a missionary will adequately implement the declaration of the gospel to people of different cultures without losing or distorting the actual meaning of the gospel."

Such aesthetic homage for these moving objects (animals) is not the human desire for possessing but an aura of nature, which has only been expressed in the form of fine art, such as painting and sculpture, so the method of taking the living object directly has never been attempted. This study aims to examine how the physical conversion, which has been scientific conservation of that, generates a desire to possess an object in the observer by stuffing fish, underwater creatures of the animals of nature that are generally difficult to process. This is because fish are poikilothermals that are harder to physically process, compared to land animals, and such an attempt has a significance in further preempting the object. As for the research method, by stuffing the fish species directly gathered by the researcher, this study would model the shape and skin of the object and examine the process of the generation of the desire for possessing in visual and tactile aspects through physical conversion. As for the research scope, by selecting Siniperca scherzeri in Order Centrarchiformes, which has the most glamorous one of freshwater fish of South Korea as the subject, this study would preempt its shape and color and understand the human psychology to possess it from the antisepticized individuals, treating it as an ‘object’ instead of an ‘organism’ with life force.This means that how the object, completed through the process of drying and coating by taking it apart and transforming its skin and traits can be recognized as a kitsch object for us. Taxidermy acts as the desire beyond the original object as an opportunity to think over the intrinsic beauty of the object through the transformed form, hardness, texture, and gloss. This describes how fetishism can be utilized as a materialistic value through human philosophical thinking as the human desire appears as the suspension of time with the thickening of the preemption of the object."
Achievable Sum Rate of NOMA with Negatively-Correlated Information Sources,2021,"['NOMA', 'Correlated Information Sources', 'Sum rate', 'Superposition coding', 'Successive interference cancellation', 'Power allocation.']",,"As the number of connected smart devices and applications increases explosively, the existing orthogonal multiple access (OMA) techniques have become insufficient to accommodate mobile traffic, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things (IoT). Fortunately, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in the fifth generation (5G) mobile networks has been regarded as a promising solution, owing to increased spectral efficiency and massive connectivity. In this paper, we investigate the achievable data rate for non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with negatively-correlated information sources (CIS). For this, based on the linear transformation of independent random variables (RV), we derive the closed-form expressions for the achievable data rates of NOMA with negatively-CIS. Then it is shown that the achievable data rate of the negatively-CIS NOMA increases for the stronger channel user, whereas the achievable data rate of the negatively-CIS NOMA decreases for the weaker channel user, compared to that of the positively-CIS NOMA for the stronger or weaker channel users, respectively. We also show that the sum rate of the negatively-CIS NOMA is larger than that of the positively-CIS NOMA. As a result, the negatively-CIS could be more efficient than the positively-CIS, when we transmit CIS over 5G NOMA networks."

Business needs to adapt to the fast-changing customer demands and be sensitive about new ideas in the digitally transformed environment. Pivoting is emerging as an important management strategy, especially among startup ventures in which business agility is more critical for success. Pivoting refers to the directional course correction in strategy or business model, targeted to test new ideas deviating from the initial conception of the business while anchored on critically important aspect of the business. Though many successful cases are publicized through popular media, the research about the pivoting is still sparse. After reviewing extant literature on pivot, a new classification scheme for business pivot is proposed here, consisting of structural, product-related, customer-related, and operational pivots summarizing the detail types presented in the most popular typology. Then, a case study is conducted of a startup which has conducted multiple pivots for about 20 years since the inception. In depth analysis of this case is revealed the decision making processes on and around these five pivots. In this case, the pivoting anchor is found to be, technologically, the point-of-sales system, and small independent business enterprises in terms of business, such as neighborhood restaurants. With their business strategically anchored on these two, this firm has conducted five pivots. These five pivots are described in detail here and the triggers and the processes of pivoting decision are analyzed with influencing factors on these decision makings.

Research on the Fusion Relationship between FMCG Packaging and Purchase Intention on Social Media Platforms,2021,"['Fusion relationship', 'FMCG packaging', 'Social media', 'Purchase intention']",,"From the perspective of social media (self-media), this research analyzes the fusion relationship between different dimensions of FMCG packaging design and product purchase intention, and puts forward corresponding views and strategies at the theoretical and application levels. In the social media era, the right of information control, the right of choice, and the right of discourse gradually incline to the public, and the one-way information output in the field of United Media is transforming into the information interaction and multiple control of Focus Media. All brands are using a more flexible way to export brand culture and values. At this point, the field of product packaging is an important export. The role of product packaging has expanded from a static storage carrier to a modern circulation medium, and has become an important channel connecting brands and consumers. Excellent product packaging can not only stimulate consumers to purchase, but also, through the spontaneous sharing of consumers in social media, achieve propagation fission and maximize the promotion of brand communication. In previous studies, few studies have been conducted on product packaging factors and their influencing mechanisms with purchase intention from the perspective of brand communication, therefore further research is needed to enrich theoretical research in this field and optimize product packaging strategies. This paper analyzes and refines the obtained interview data, and obtains four dimensions of FMCG packaging: functionality, sensation, emotionality and topicality, and constructs the model of FMCG packaging’s influence mechanism on purchase intention. Relevant research hypotheses are put forward. Research has found that the functionality, sensation, emotionality, and topicality of FMCG packaging have a significant impact on purchase intention, and topicality has the greatest impact. Topic has become the primary factor influencing consumers’ FMCG purchase intention in the social media era. Combining the research conclusion of this paper with the status quo of enterprise marketing, this paper puts forward corresponding marketing suggestions for the packaging design of the FMCG industry."

In this process, the method of evaluating the performance of approximation uses the loss function. Existing in-depth learning methods implement approximation that takes into account loss functions in the linear approximation process, but non-linear approximation phases that use active functions use non-linear transformation that is not related to reduction of loss functions of loss. This study proposes parametric activation functions that introduce scale parameters that can change the scale of activation functions and location parameters that can change the location of activation functions. By introducing parametric activation functions based on scale and location parameters, the performance of nonlinear approximation using activation functions can be improved. The scale and location parameters in each hidden layer can improve the performance of the deep neural network by determining parameters that minimize the loss function value through the learning process using the primary differential coefficient of the loss function for the parameters in the backpropagation. Through MNIST classification problems and XOR problems, parametric activation functions have been found to have superior performance over existing activation functions."

To this end, the theory of the chirplet transform and modal acoustic emission are used to analyze the propagation of elastic waves in thin plates. First, the chirplet transform and the dispersion curves of the fundamental Lamb wave modes are utilized to separate the first-arrived modes and to estimate the distance between a source and a sensor. Then an analytical model is developed to simulate their late-arrived wave packets. Finally, the correlation between the experimental and the simulated waveform is used to estimate the location of AE source. To validate the proposed source localization algorithm, experiments were performed on a steel plate using the Hsu-Nielsen pencil lead break (PLB) test. Results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively localize AE source regardless of the location of the sources."

Our contribution is to introduce a controller that does not need joint velocity measurements, and instead it uses the output of a linear filtering of weighted joint position errors to add damping. The proposed controller allows bringing the nonactuated pendulum rod towards its upright position, while the wheel spins asymptotically to a desired constant speed. A complete stability analysis based on Barbashin–Krasovskii’s theorem is presented together with an estimate of domain of attraction. Simulation results upon a torque–driven inertia wheel pendulum model illustrate the performance of the proposed controller."

Numerical analysis of the effect of tool wear on surface integrity during hard turning,2021,['· Hard turning · Surface integrity · White layer · FEM · Thermal modeling'],,"The white layer formed during hard turning deteriorates surface integrity, thereby severely affecting the fatigue life of machined parts. A 2D FEM-based simulation model has been developed to simulate cutting temperature profiles in workpieces for the prediction of white layer thickness developed below the machined surface. Machining was simulated for fresh and worn tools with predefined flank wear. The temperature profile generated in the workpiece was analyzed for the critical temperature for phase transformation leading to white layer formation. The critical temperature was found to be deeper in the subsurface with an increase in cutting speed and wear, indicating a thicker subsurface white layer. Experimental observations using fresh tools were found very close to the simulation results. The model was extended to simulate temperature profile and predict the white layer for machining with tools having predefined tool flank wear."

Classification of blade’s leading edge based on neural networks in adaptive machining of near-net-shaped blade,2021,['Near-net-shape blade · Adaptive machining · Discrimination · Style transformation · DenseNet · Classification'],,"The near-net-shaped blade is adopted in the aero engine as it’s material-saving and efficient. However, the leading edge shape’s curvature is sharply changed in its machining process and the deformation trend of each cross section has slight differences. Using the traditional machining method is exhausting and time-consuming. Furthermore, it brings more errors during the whole machining process. Therefore, adaptive machining is imported in the machining of the near-net-shaped blade and the leading edge is to be reconstructed during this process. Besides, it is necessary to know whether the reconstructed leading edge is qualified. To address these two issues, a novel approach is proposed to discriminate and classify leading edges. In this paper, we trained a style transform model of generative adversarial networks with theoretical leading edges and used its discriminator network to evaluate the similarity of reconstructed leading edges we had accomplished in our previous work to establish a standard for the qualified reconstructed leading edge. Then, as the curvature of the near-net-shaped blade changes sharply and has complex features, which requires high accuracy of classification, different DenseNet models were adopted to classify whether these reconstructed images are qualified. We experimented on our LDEG dataset and the highest accuracy on the test set was 88.7%. The experiment results demonstrated that the proposed method is effective in evaluating and classifying leading edges in the machining process."
Prognostic Impact of Age at the Time of Diagnosis in Korean Patients with Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma in the Rituximab Era: A Single Institution Study,2021,"['Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma', 'Age', 'Prognosis', 'Statistical model']",,"Purpose In contrast to the Western diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), prognostic impact of age in a Korean population with DLBCL has not been fully evaluated.Materials and Methods Six hundred and eight DLBCL patients treated with rituximab-containing chemotherapeutic regimens from January 2002 to March 2012 in Asan Medical Center were enrolled. Survival models using the restricted cubic spine−transformed age variable were constructed to evaluate non-linear relationships between age and survival outcome. Finally, age was categorized according to the conventional international prognostic index (IPI), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)-IPI, and Grupo Español de Linfomas/Trasplante Autólogo de Médula Ósea (GELTAMO)-IPI schemes and the prognostic implications were evaluated.Results The relative hazard did not change significantly during the first to fifth decades, but began to increase exponentially in patients aged over 62 years. This pattern or relationship was also retained in a multivariate model fitted to the age-adjusted IPI and relative dose intensity. Multivariate survival analysis revealed that age > 75 years, but not age > 60 years, was associated independently with poor overall and progression-free survival when the relative dose intensity and age-adjusted IPI were taken into account.Conclusion The outcome of DLBCL in Korean populations may deteriorate rapidly as age exceeds 62 years. Therefore, a consensus cutoff value for age in Korean DLBCL patients should be determined to better predict prognosis."

For this purpose, a two-level, multilevel model analysis was conducted using the data of elementary schools in the 4th cycle of 『An Analysis of the Level of School Education and its Actual Condition』 provided by the Korean Educational Development Institute(KEDI). According to the analysis, first, the teachers’ school financial autonomy is affected not only by personal characteristics but also by the characteristics of the school to which they belong. Second, as a result of inputting the teacher- and school-level background variables, the career, position, and school size showed statistically significant positive effects. Third, it was found that the number of trainings in school finances conducted by the unit schools, which was emphasized in previous studies on teachers’ school financial management, did not have a significant effect on the financial autonomy of teachers. Fourth, school organizational culture variables, including the transformational leadership of the principal and the cooperation of teachers in school, were found to explain a significant aspect of the difference between schools in their school financial autonomy, and both had significant positive effects on teachers’ financial autonomy.

Intra-Organizational Factors Affecting Business Performance: An Empirical Study in Vietnam,2021,"['Rational Reasoning Perspective', 'Creative Reasoning Perspective', 'Business Performance', 'Employee Commitment', 'Company Reputation']",,"In the era of industry 4.0 with the robust digital transformation, especially under the trigger of the Covid-19 pandemic, the process of transforming businesses to achieve the desired business performance depends much on the mindset transformation of each member of the organization, beginning with the thoughts of leadership and stakeholders. This study will evaluate the relationship between leadership’s strategic reasoning perspectives on employee engagement or commitment and the company’s reputation, thereby directly or indirectly affecting organizational performance. The study examines data from 382 companies out of 500 samples in typical industries in Vietnam using the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) techniques. The results show that holistic thinking is closely related to employee retention and corporate reputation, thereby increasing the business outcomes of the organization, whereas there was no evidence to support analytical thinking in this study. As a consequence, transforming the business to achieve the desired business performance is heavily reliant on changing the mindset of each member of the organization, beginning with the top leaders and influencers of the business. This will assist Vietnamese leaders in gaining a comprehensive understanding of corporate governance and controlling the relationships between organizational constructs."

Rostow’s modernization theory of the 1960s was the product of compromises he made with political power in the 1950s. Rostow’s theory―most notably articulated in The Stages of Economic Growth (1960)―have been criticized for its hubristic arguments regarding the linear process of modernization, the universal applicability of the American model of capitalism, and the United States’ ability to transform “backward” societies across the world. These arguments convinced U.S. policymakers in the 1960s and thereby paved the way to the imperialistic wars in Vietnam and other places of the Third World. This course, however, was neither preordained nor inevitable. Until the early 1950s, Rostow had given serious attention to the particularities of each society, power of nationalism in Asian and Africa, and long and dark shadow of European imperialism in the Third World. Rostow’s engagement with the Eisenhower administration in the 1950s was critical in reshaping his theory. At the behest of Eisenhower’s adviser C. D. Jackson, Rostow tried to promote his theory among the Republicans in power. In so doing, he accepted a series of compromises by remaking his theory softer and simpler―thus more acceptable to the policymakers. Through the process, his theory had gradually become hubristic― overconfident in the ability of almighty America, arrogant at backward countries, and ignorant about imperialism of the past and present. The previous scholarship presumed Rostow’s modernization theory as something already given, while focusing exclusively on its evil influence on the Vietnam War. My narrative on Rostow’s transformation will give fresh insights into the relationship between intellectuals and political power."

The traditional approach, commercial motive, focus on instrumental knowledge coupled with many other contemporary issues have collectively smothered the fundamental humanistic principles of education. To avert the situation and execute the core objectives, we need to shift our focus: a shift from instrumental knowledge to humanistic-transformational knowledge; a shift from the traditional approach of supplying and storing information to learning to deal with the real-world problems; a shift from head to heart. Values integration is an attempt to initiate and promote this shift. Rather than teaching values and moral principles under a particular subject heading, values need to be a part of everyday in-school and out-school activities. To concretize this concept, a model is proposed in this study as a holistic model of values integration via whole school ambiances and community support."

This article explores the identity theories in continuity and change category that juvenile criminal desistance is caused by a change from deviant identity to pro-social identity. Using data of delinquents who was sentenced from juvenile courts in South Korea, I analyzed how pro-social identity change over time, whether this change affect negative or positive cognition and behavior after release from training schools, and what are predictors to change their identity. The analyses of latent growth model reveal that pro-social identity increase over time and significant predictors of this change are age, type of protective disposition, attachment to parents, support of training school staffs. Most of all, the results support identity theories of desistance that through identity changes, while seduction of criminal conduct is decreasing over time, social support to help them and job aspiration for future are increasing over time. These results have implications for desistance theories from crime as well as desistance programs in juvenile correctional practices."

Therefore, we propose an artificial neural network strategy for structural dynamics problems using the iterated improved reduced system (iIRS) method. In the proposed method, characteristics of structural data are first extracted using the transformation matrix of the iIRS method. Next, the neural network (NN) is trained using only the extracted features. The prediction fields are restored by combining the trained NN results with the transformation matrix in the iIRS method. As a result, the quality of NN for structural dynamics problems is significantly improved owing to the efficient computational procedure. The performance of the proposed method is verified using the gearbox-housing model in an electric vehicle."

Through this, I attempt to consider the achievements of Yussisamdaerok in the narrative of repentance and reformation. To this end, I divided this survey into three categories: 1) passing the test through similar cases, 2) showing qualities by enhancing morality, 3) and generous treatment of the contempt around her.First, “passing the test through similar cases” may be summarized as follows. The narrative of Jang Seol-hye, which appears as a mise en abyme of the narrative of Jang Hye-aeng, serves as a mirror reflecting the narrative of Jang Hye-aeng. Jang Hye-aeng is clearly differentiated from Jang Seol-hye with her fair demeanor, making her appear clearly different from her past sinful self. This can be said to be an epic device that embodies the step of ‘escaping from the past’. Second, the following is related to “showing qualities by enhancing morality.” Through moral discipline and an excellent performance, Jang Hye-aeng emerges as an unrivaled figure replacing the vacancy of Princess Jinyang, the most ideal figure in Yussisamdaerok. Jang Hye-aeng, who was enlightened by Princess Jinyang’s teaching, is now revered by the family as an incarnation of Princess Jinyang. This can be said to be a step toward a ‘rebirth as a new self’. Third, the “generous treatment of the contempt around her” can be explained as follows. Jang Hye-aeng establishes her status as the eldest daughter-in-law of the family by eliminating the lingering embers of hatred. Due to her previous behavior, Mrs. Sun gives a look of contempt and disgust. However, Jang Hye-aeng, through her extremely generous and polite behavior, sheds the shadow of such hatred and establishes herself as the eldest daughter-in-law of the Yu family in name and reality. This functions as the step of “passing through the last gateway as an unrivaled being.” In short, Yussisamdaerok marks an important milestone in narratives of repentance and reformation in the late 17th and early 18th centuries by portraying the process of becoming an unrivaled member of one’s husband’s family through the female character of Jang Hye-aeng. It is not uncommon for a woman to correct her mistakes in full-length novels, and it is a remarkable achievement that depicts a woman who is reborn as an exceedingly unique person. These observations are based on the author’s deep awareness of human nature and the situation of women. It is significant in that it presents the most ideal model of human beings who are striving to improve themselves."

The traditional customs are deeply rooted and remain in the tradition and modern times. During the period of the Republic of China, by the influence of the western legal model, legislators insisted on the legal principles of ""legal property"" and"" one thing and one right"". The legal system of land and property formulated by them is high in the air, which has not produced a good effect in practice. In modern social practice, there are still heavy traditional trading habits. In the intertwined conflict between habits and nation al laws, the legal expression of property right deviates from the actual state of land rights. it is closely related to the personal quality of legal experts at the subjective level, the legislative and judicial value orientation, the penetration of political factors, as well as the objective and complex social reality, the confusion of legislative bodies, and the lack of legislative technology."
비정수배 치차비 적응형 동기발전기 부하각 측정 알고리즘,2021,"['synchronous power generator', 'load angle', 'parameter estimation', 'generator model', 'power plant']",,"In the case of the currently commercialized load angle measurement system, there is no problem if the generator rotation period is an integer multiple of the turbine teeth pulse period like a large-capacity generator. However, in the case of a small-capacity cogeneration or gas turbine mainly using a reduction gear, the turbine rotation period is often a non-integer multiple of the teeth pulse period. In this case, a slip phenomenon occurs when measuring the load angle due to a cumulative error caused by a non-integer multiple. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for measuring load angle of a synchronous generator that can be applied even when the period of the generator terminal voltage is not an integer multiple of the gear pulse period. The algorithm proposed in this paper converts the generator terminal voltage and the generator turbine teeth signal into a phasor signal through a DFT(Discrete Fourier Transform) filter, calculates the generator output frequency and the turbine teeth pulse frequency precisely, measures the ratio between the frequencies, and analyzes and calculates the generator load angle from the phase difference of the two phasor signals."

As the recent digital transformation has been accelerated, the development of the mobile environment has increased the acquisition of tourism information online, and with this change, the need for strategic changes in the center has been raised. Therefore, in this study, the purpose of it is to analyze the status of the domestic center based on the characteristics of the O4O platform that allows visitors to maximize their experience by adding online services with physical space. (Method) First, through theoretical consideration of center, the need for design improvement has derived. Second, through prior research review, we have summarized the spatial characteristics of the O4O platform into variability, openness, functional complexity, and high-technology and derived the O4O platform characterization model of the center by organizing empirical characteristics into activeness, user-centered, interrelation, and channel integration. Third, in order to a case study, we have selected five domestic centers according to the standards of the general information center that are released by the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism and the Korea Tourism Organization, and we have applied the analytical model to analyze the characteristics of the O4O platform that are appeared in the domestic center. (Results) As a result, the status of the O4O platform characteristics of the center in Korea showed that the characteristics were variable, open, functional complexity, and high-technology. However, empirical characteristics were both interrelated and active, but channel integration and user-centered that link online and offline were not shown in most cases. From the analysis, we know that the domestic center as the O4O platform is applied to every case by user to user, user to space, and space to space, and we also know that the application of online-related services was insufficient. (Conclusions) Based on the results of the case analysis, proposals for the direction of application about the O4O platform of the domestic center is like the following. To maximize visitors' experiences in using space, offline space, web, applications, and SNS channels should be integrated. Also, in order to create convenient experiences to satisfy each visitor's tourism needs and lifestyle, we should collect visitors' information and provide customized services using NFC, QR code, and digital devices.

Research design, data and methodology: This study reviews news articles, reports and literature to find out Korean universities’ financial condition and examines some successful and failed examples of their corporations’ profit-making business operations to suggest a direction. Results: Private universities suffer declining enrollments and/or tuition freeze but they lack in making efforts to secure financial health. The reviewed examples of private universities’ profit-making business operations suggest both universities and their corporations should first assume the public accountability prior to engaging in diverse business activities. Conclusions: First, to remain financially healthy, university corporations should exert themselves to transform their low-profit-margin lands and buildings into high-profit-margin businesses and to credit the realized income to their school-expense accounts. And, the ultimate purpose of universities’ profit-making business operations is to realize a decent income without prejudice to their public accountability for the country and community, while forging a virtuous cycle by investing the income for the betterment of their educational quality and competitiveness."

The unprecedented global movement towards transnational and cross-racial alliances has evoked the history of racial triangulation and mutual struggle under white supremacy, as the two racial minorities have vied for political and cultural citizenship. Korean-Canadian writer Ins Choi’s 2011 stage play Kim’s Convenience offers a contemporary Korean American perspective on the changing contours of the Afro-Korean relationship at a time when previous forms of race-based community disintegrate following the logic of individual success and upward mobility. Set in a small corner store owned by a first-generation Korean immigrant located in a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood in Toronto, mundane interactions between the Kims and black customers remind the audience of particular racial perceptions and relationships that operate in this historically charged space within the American cultural imagination. As the play progresses, the Korean-owned convenience store becomes a performative site of transformation where racial histories are evoked and can be reimagined. Kim’s Convenience asks that we move beyond the racial past and envision a collective future against structural racism that persists in the form of transnational corporate capitalism."

Previous studies to defend the adversarial examples can be classified into three categories: (1) model retraining methods; (2) input transformation methods; and (3) adversarial examples detection methods. However, even though the defense methods against adversarial examples have constantly been proposed, there is no research to classify the type of adversarial attack. In this paper, we proposed an adversarial attack family classification method based on dimensionality reduction and clustering. Specifically, after extracting adversarial perturbation from adversarial example, we performed Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce the dimensionality of adversarial perturbation and performed K-means algorithm to classify the type of adversarial attack family. From the experimental results using MNIST dataset and CIFAR-10 dataset, we show that the proposed method can efficiently classify five tyeps of adversarial attack(FGSM, BIM, PGD, DeepFool, C&W). We also show that the proposed method provides good classification performance even in a situation where the legitimate input to the adversarial example is unknown."

In its attempt at economic diversification in the last two decades, the country has also taken a lead in the GCC region in introducing extensive reforms to attract FDI to the Emirates. However, oil price volatilities have posed a significant challenge to all oil-exporting countries. The main aim of this study is to explore the impact of economic diversification and oil price on the UAE stock market. The study applies Granger Causality and Vector Autoregressive Model on monthly Abu Dhabi stock exchange index, Dubai Fateh crude oil spot price, and FDI inflows during 2001–19. The short-term interbank rate has been included as a monetary policy variable. The results show a substantial difference between the two phases of reforms. Oil price and Abu Dhabi stock index show bidirectional relationship during 2001–09 but no causality was found during 2010–19. Furthermore, the second phase was characterized by unidirectional causation from FDI to ADX index. This study highlights FDI inflows as a key driver of stock market performance during the last decade and emphasizes the success of the intense reforms in the UAE initiated for the diversification of its economy."

This study used a DEA-Malmquist model to calculate and analyze the wheat total factor productivity (TFP) of 12 major wheat-producing provinces from 2005 to 2019. The data necessary for this calculation were obtained from the “National Farm Product Cost-benefit Survey”. Further to this calculation, an LSDVC model was used to explore the factors influencing the TFP. For this, the data were obtained from the “China Statistical Yearbook”, “Rural Statistical Yearbook of China”, and “Transport Yearbook”. The results showed that from 2005 to 2019, China’s wheat total factor productivity showed a decline and increased at an average annual rate of -1.5%. As far as the factors influencing the wheat production efficiency are concerned, the total mechanical power has a significant positive impact on the TFP of wheat. In contrast, government expenditures for agriculture, forestry and water resources, and industrialization have significantly adverse effects on the wheat TFP. Moreover , the rural road density and urbanization showed no significant impact on the TFP of wheat. Therefore, to promote the sustainable improvement of wheat productivity, the future development of the wheat industry should focus on the transformation of the agricultural development mode, human resources investment, and encourage the industry sector to nurture agriculture."
A study on estimating the interlayer boundary of the subsurface using a artificial neural network with electrical impedance tomography,2021,"['Electrical impedance tomography', 'artificial neural network', 'front points', 'subsurface', 'interlayer estimation']",,"Subsurface topology estimation is an important factor in the geophysical survey. Electrical impedance tomography is one of the popular methods used for subsurface imaging. The EIT inverse problem is highly nonlinear and ill-posed; therefore, reconstructed conductivity distribution suffers from low spatial resolution. The subsurface region can be approximated as piece-wise separate regions with constant conductivity in each region; therefore, the conductivity estimation problem is transformed to estimate the shape and location of the layerboundary interface. Each layer interface boundary is treated as an open boundary that is described using front points. The subsurface domain contains multi-layers with very complex configurations, and, in such situations, conventional methods such as the modified Newton Raphson method fail to provide the desired solution. Therefore, in this work, we have implemented a 7-layer artificial neural network (ANN) as an inverse problem algorithm to estimate the front points that describe the multi-layer interface boundaries. An ANN model consisting of input, output, and five fully connected hidden layers are trained for interlayer boundary reconstruction using training data that consists of pairs of voltage measurements of the subsurface domain with three-layer configuration and the corresponding front points of interface boundaries. The results from the proposed ANN model are compared with the gravitational search algorithm (GSA) for interlayer boundary estimation, and the results show that ANN is successful in estimating the layer boundaries with good accuracy."

In particular, this article presents a tap-changing, impedance turn-ratio modeling and differential operation strategy for an LVRT/HVRT test facility based on the autotransformer of the tap method to overcome the disadvantages of the RLC method. The performance test for a 30kW scaled artificial LVRT/HVRT test facility was implemented by modeling and the operation method proposed above.

Therefore, various studies have been conducted on the establishment of smart factories and the demand for good weldability in the fields of production and manufacturing. In shipbuilding welding and pipe welding, the uniformly generated back-bead is an important criterion for judging the mechanical properties and weldability of the welded structure, and is also an important factor that enables the realization of an automated welding system. Therefore, in this study, the welding current signal measured in real-time in the GMAW process was pre-processed by a short time Fourier transform (STFT) to obtain a time-frequency domain feature image (spectrogram). Based on this, a back-bead generation detection algorithm was developed. To accelerate the training speed of the proposed convolution neural network (CNN) model, we used non-saturating neurons and a highly efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. As a result of applying the proposed detection model to actual welding process, the detection accuracies with and without the back-bead regions were 95.8% and 94.2%, respectively, which confirmed the excellent classification performance for back-bead generation."

To examine these effects, in this work, the technological diversification index was measured in an entropy-based manner and it was divided into related and unrelated diversification indices. It is also meaningful to demonstrate dynamically the dispersion effect of unsystematic risks on the above diversification index over time. As a result, it is shown that only unrelated technology diversification strategies have a dynamic effect that transforms the dispersion effect of unsystematic risks of IP firms into the positive effect over time.

Kilpatrick의 프로젝트법은 기술교육의 수업에서 기존의 교과의 논리적인 측면에 부가하여 학생의 심리적인 측면을 강조한 것은 큰 전환이 되었다. 셋째, 기술교육에서의 교사의 역할을 감독자나 전수자가 아닌 조언자와 촉진자로 전환시켜 주었다. 기술교육에서 학습자들의 동기를 유발시키고 효과를 촉진하기 위하여 교사의 역할이 조언자와 촉진자가 바뀌는 계기에 프로젝트법이 기여하였다. 넷째, 기술교육에서 프로젝트법을 통해 전통적으로 선형 모형(linear model)에 따라 기술 작품을 따라하기나 모방하기에서 벗어나 학습자들이 자기주도적으로 작품을 창의성으로 만드는 것을 중시하는 혁신적인 문화를 가져다 주었다. 프로젝트 교육과 더불어 프로젝트 활동 교육을 강조함에 따라 기술교육에서의 기술습득을 자기주도 프로젝트 활동을 통해 할 수 있도록 전환되 었다. 다섯째, Kilpatrick의 프로젝트법으로 인해 전통적으로 기술교육에서의 이론과 실습의 엄격한 분리에서 벗어나 통합 모형 (univesal model)에 따른 프로젝트 활동을 하게 하는 계기가 되었다. 마지막으로, Kilpatrick의 프로젝트법은 기술교육에서의 모호한 프로젝트 수행단계를 보다 구체적으로 수행할 수 있도록 제시 해 주었다. Kilpatrick의 프로젝트법이 목적설정, 계획, 수행, 판단의 4단계를 기본으로 다양한 단계(준비, 프로젝트 선정, 정보탐 색, 설계, 제작, 평가)를 적용하여 변형할 수 있는 여지를 주었다.","The purpose of this study is to explore issues related to the traditional project method and Kilpatrick's project method in technology education, and to derive educational implications for Kilpatrick's project method to be newly applied in the field of technology education. First, Kilpatrick defined the concept of a project too broadly, which caused confusion as a teaching method in technolgy education, but provided an opportunity for general use in technolgy activity classes. Second, it has traditionally been a method to bring about a shift from teacher-centered activities to student-centered activities in technolgy education. Third, the role of teachers in technolgy education has been transformed into advisors and facilitators rather than supervisors or trainers. In order to motivate learners and promote activities, the project method contributed to the opportunity to change the role of the teacher as a guide. Fourth, by applying the project method in technolgy education, it brought about a change that emphasized creativity and technology application of learners in their own initiative, away from imitating technical works. Fifth, by introducing Kilpatrick's project method, it allowed integrated project activities to break away from the traditional strict separation of theory and practice in technolgy education. Finally, Kilpatrick's project method suggested that the ambiguous project execution stage in traditional technolgy education could be carried out more specifically."

It can be characterized as an autonomous management of grains, organization of villagers, and donation of grains by the rich villagers. This was a natural turn as the public famine relief centered with the public grain came to its limitation and as a result, more and more private relief with private grains became an important method of famine relief. Community Pact (鄕約) and the shared asset in the unit of sub-county community for funding various cost such as famine relief can be seen as an usual form in the 19th century. In 1877 famine relief of Suncheon region, among the grains procured from the residents, nearly 20 percent were in the name of ‘voluntary donation’ of rich villagers. The Community Loan system implemented after Gabo Reform assigned the amount of grain in accordance with the size of the county, and the policy was set that the management would be autonomous among the villagers. However, the official authority continued to intervene, and this became a reason for disrupting civil autonomy and resulted in the poor management of the Community Loan system. Even in the beginning of the 20th century, the Community Loan system did not diminish, and it was utilized in the establishment of local financial associations by the colonial authority. It was transformed into a new form, for example, in 1933, the farming rice loan project began, and it was considered as a resurrection of the Community Loan system. The famine relief system, which the Joseon dynasty systemized earlier, shows a unique facet that not only it stood as a universal political action beyond the ruling authority, but also it had a certain affinity with the management of the modern state. This requires further in-depth examination on its characteristics and patterns."
Extraction and characterization of pepsin-soluble collagen from different mantis shrimp species,2021,"['Mantis shrimp', 'Pepsin-soluble collagen', 'Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)', 'Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR)', 'Solubility']",,"The objective of this study was to investigate the yield and characteristics of collagen protein extracted from the muscle of four different species of mantis shrimp: Miyakella nepa, Harpiosquilla harpax, Erugosquilla woodmasoni, and Odontodactylus cultrifer.Mantis shrimp muscle was extracted by using a pepsin-solubilization technique, with 0.5 M acetic acid and 5% pepsin enzyme.The highest collagen yield was from M. nepa muscle (0.478 ± 0.06%), which was significantly greater (p < 0.05) than that from H.harpax, O. cultrifer, and E. woodmasoni (0.313 ± 0.03%, 0.123 ± 0.02%, and 0.015 ± 0.00%, respectively). The freeze-dried collagen appeared as thin fibers, and formed an opaque film. The pepsin-soluble collagen (PSC) from four mantis shrimp species was analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The results showed that all species of mantis shrimp contained type I collagen, consisting of β, α1, and α2 subunits with average molecular weights of 250, 145, and 118 kDa, respectively. The study of the solubility of collagen showed that, for NaCl, collagen had the highest relative solubility in 2% NaCl (80.20 ± 4.95%). In contrast, the solubility decreased at higher NaCl concentrations. However, in terms of pH, collagen had the highest relative solubility at pH 3 (91.32 ± 5.14%), and its solubility decreased at higher pH. FT-IR spectroscopy was used to compare the collagen with a model compound. Five wavenumbers in the spectrum for model collagen were identified: Amide A (3,406–3,421 cm–1), amide B (2,916–2,940 cm–1), amide I (1,639–1,640 cm–1), amide II (1,539–1,570 cm–1), and amide III (1,234–1,250 cm–1)."

During the period of the Reform Movement of 1898, the Constitutional Movement in the late Qing Dynasty and the Bei Yang Government, the parliamentary legislative system of the Zi Zheng Yuan, the Consultation and the Senate made the ancient China have a new understanding of the political concept of Western learning. At the beginning of the introduction of China, “legislation” experienced cultural pains and difficult transplants and became the epitome of the modernization process of the whole country. The recognition and transformation of the ""constitutional"" political thinking formed in the process of accepting the Western new legislative model is accompanied by the introduction of ""civil rights"" by the reformists in the late Qing Dynasty and the respect of the ""public opinion"" by the Zi Zheng Yuan. This is not only an important practical link in China’s “constitutional” historical approach, but also directly affects the exploration of “legislation” in China as a whole since modern times."

In comparison with the work to design deep learning models, preparing datasets is a long haul; at the moment, in the domain of vision intelligent, datasets are still being made by handwork requiring a lot of time and efforts, where workers need to directly make labels on each image usually with GUI-based labeling tools. In this paper, we overview the current status of vision datasets focusing on what datasets are being shared and how they are prepared with various labeling tools. Particularly, in order to relieve the repetitive and tiring labeling work, we present an interactive smart image annotating system with which the annotation work can be transformed from the direct human-only manual labeling to a correction-after-checking by means of a support of automatic labeling. In an experiment, we show that automatic labeling can greatly improve the productivity of datasets especially reducing time and efforts to specify regions of objects found in images. Finally, we discuss critical issues that we faced in the experiment to our annotation system and describe future work to raise the productivity of image datasets creation for accelerating AI technology."

Since the 1970s, Sculptures presented by Claes Oldenburg (Sweden,1929-2009),borrowed objects from daily life and enlarged it in proportion, destroyed the usual system of concept, eliminated routine and functionality. Then the relationship between art and popular aesthetic consciousness changed; On the other hand, China ushered in a new transformation period with the opening policy and globalization in the 1980s. Zhan Wang (China,1962—), who was at this transitional period, borrowed the “rockery” in ancient Chinese gardens. While absorbing the conflict between Chinese traditional aesthetic consciousness and modern reconstruction, combining the characteristics of the region and the times, he created a new look of modern sculpture different from Oldenburg’s. This paper confirms the fact that different artistic features of the two sculptors’ works are based on contemporary social, political, economic and cultural development and changes. These also formed the life and aesthetic consciousness of the two sculptors who used the borrowing method in their works."

Although it has achieved remarkable growth by tapping into a global niche market with preschool animation series such as <Porong Porong Pororo>, the industry is still surviving hard times due to some critical local and global factors: low revenue generated from the domestic broadcasting rights, radical YouTube revenue decrease due to its new regulation prohibiting data gathering and targeted ads on kids animation and the global pandemic broke out in the early 2020. In addition, preschool animation occupies majority of the Korean animation industry; therefore, to maximize and broaden the commercial opportunities, it is necessary to diversify its target audience by producing animation for older age groups. The Korean animation companies have not actively tackled into this domain because there has not been enough feasible business models studied and introduced to maximize the profits and even to recoup the production investment. Thus, in addition to the conventional merchandising and licensing models, we would like to propose so called, ‘Digital M&L’ business model utilizing the newly emerging NFT (Non Fungible Token) technology. Through studying and examining the possibility of Digital M&L and NFT, we would like to help expand and diversify the Korean animation industry securing a wide range of audiences, not only the preschoolers but also the teenagers and adults, transforming the Korean animation into a healthy industrial environment where various animation productions can branch out."

They are succeeding in adopting the cultural model of Su Dongpo Chibi boating excursion, creatively transforming it, and localizing it. In this, there is a taste of drinking alcohol under the bright moon, reciting poetry, and enjoying chatting. It also reflects the reality of the times and patriotism. Boating was also a stage for communication and harmony among poetry party.  The trend of reenacting the Su Dongpo’ Chibi boating excursion of residents of the Joseon Dynasty can be said to be the shift of culture from China to Joseon. These two axes are sometimes confronted and complementary to each other, making them a duet.  Sangju Nakdong River boating poetry is boating excursion of the Nakdong River in Sangju, which lasted 51 times for 666 years, starting from Lee Gyubo of the Goryeo dynasty until the late Joseon Dynasty. In particular, 『Imsulbeomwolrok』 is a record of literary activities that have been passed down from generation to generation for 171 years (1607∼1778), and there is no unprecedented record in China, and it is estimated to be the record of the world""s longest poetry, not only in East Asia, but also in the world."
Comparison of audio input representations on piano transcription using neural networks,2021,"['Audio input representation', 'automatic music transcription', 'neural network', 'spectrogram']",,"We compare the effect of multiple input representations on polyphonic piano music transcription based on neural networks. A state-of-the-art piano transcription neural network model, onsets and frames, is explored. We first provide detailed backgrounds of the piano transcription and input representations for the readers who are unfamiliar with this area. For comparing their effects, we consider four spectrograms; Mel-spectrogram, Linear-spectrogram, Log-spectrogram and constant-Q-transform with various hyper parameters. The effects of frequency bins, Short Time Fourier Transformation (STFT) window size and hop length on the four spectrograms are also examined. Our results show that Mel-spectrogram of 2,048 STFT window size, 512 frequency bins and 256 hop length yields the highest accuracy. We show that Mel-spectrogram is one of the most satisfactory input representations in general. Mel-spectrogram dominates other spectrograms and keeps a relatively high transcription accuracy even at the low resolutions in our experiments."

Even though this act was abolished during democratization movement and a new act entitled ‘The Act on the Registration of the Periodical Press, etc.’ was introduced in 1987, the right to reply and the Press Arbitration Committee (PAC), adopted in 1980, continued in the new act. The act of 1987 was substituted for another new act entitled ‘The Act on Press Arbitration and Remedies, etc., for Damage caused by News Reports’ in 2005. This Act was revised in 2009 and still in effect until today. This act has adopted new contents such as the right to correction of a news report, compensation for injury, and etc. This paper reviews the 40 years of PAC and the related legal issues. First of all, the right to reply is originated from the French press law system. After that, it was adopted by the German ‘Land Gesetz(Law).’ The Korean right to reply has succeeded Baden-Wuertenberg (a German state) Press Law. But the legal arbitration system cannot be found in any other country not even in France or Germany. The PAC is unique to the Korean Press Law. At the beginning, the role of the PAC was limited to the arbitration of right to reply. Even though this right was written in the Act as “the right to correction”, t the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court of Korea decided it as “the right to reply”. The Act of 2005 introduced “the right to correction” as a new right. In general context, the global legal system does not recognize the right to correction as an arbitration, because the right to correction should be disputed in the court of justice. Secondly, the right to reply is limited to the reports on fact, following the German law. But the French press law includes the reports on criticism as well. It is not easy to distinguish criticism from reports. Thus, the reports on criticism should be acknowledged in this act. Thirdly, The Act of 2005 adopted “the compensation for injury.” The amount of compensation for injury would be small and symbolic, because the aggrieved party have a right to exercise the right to correction or the right to reply. Thus, it is undesirable to introduce the punitive damage which is recognized in the Anglo-American legal system. Fourthly, in the age of internet, the information oriented society gives rise to harmful effects on the transformation of news reports. Accordingly, it is argued that the PAC should have the power to delete or block reports with regard to defamation or fake news. However it is not easy even to define what the fake news is. Thus, an act to regulate the fake news is still under debate in domestic and international spheres. At the same time, the issue on the right to be forgotten has arisen. Any discuss of amending the Act on Press Arbitration should consider all these new and contentious phenomena. We, the Korean, have established the right to reply, the right to correction, and the PAC as the balancing instrument of the right to press and the remedy for damage. It is time to develop a Korean model of press law that the world can look up."
Reduced-dimensional design optimization of stay vane and casing of reaction hydro turbines using global sensitivity analysis,2021,"['Global sensitivity analysis', 'Global sensitivity index', 'Design optimization', 'Stay vane', 'Casing', 'Reaction hydro turbine', 'Surrogate modeling']",,"The effect of design variables on the performance measures in the entire design space can be evaluated by global sensitivity analysis (GSA). Therefore, a high-dimensional engineering problem can be transformed to a reduced-dimensional problem by ascertaining important design variables according to GSA. Subsequently, the reduction of design variables helps save computational cost and the duration of design optimization. In this study, GSA was applied to determine the most influential design variable in the design of two reaction hydro turbine components - stay vane and casing. The global sensitivity index technique is selected among GSA methods because it can evaluate both the individual and interaction effects of design variables. Genetic aggregation surrogate models are used to reduce the number of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses for GSA and design optimization. The responses from surrogate models are evaluated to obtain global sensitivity indices for performance measures. The important design variables are selected according to the indices. Using a multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA), design optimizations with the selected design variables are performed and the results are compared to the optimum designs with all design variables.The optimum designs using the selected design variables show comparable performances to those of the full-dimensional optimum designs."

Previous studies considered the Criminal Workhouse as a transitional institution from a traditional prison to a modern prison, but in the case of Tianjin, it had the characters of a “modern” prison. To prove this point, this article borrowed three criteria for distinguishing traditional/modern prisons by Ogawa Shigejiro who was a prominent penologist at that time. The first criterion is who was detained. At the outset of the TCW, the convicted and the vagrant were imprisoned together. It was similar to the characteristic of traditional prison in that groups of different features were detained in one space. However, the Vagrant Workhouse, which accommodated only the vagrant, was established in 1906, and the TCW became a space where only the convicted were confined. The second criterion is the purpose of the prison. The TCW sought to break away from traditional prisons pursuing “retaliation for crimes” and to rehabilitate the convicted and prepare their livelihood after their release. To this end, new buildings were built with an emphasis on hygiene and crime prevention, and the positions were subdivided according to the roles of personnel. Furthermore, six factories were operated in the TCW so that inmates could learn handicraft. However, the financial problem, which is the third criterion, was not solved. In particular, the detention costs which were essential for the operation of the TCW and allocated to each counties were often unpaid. For this reason, the TCW used the inmates’ abilities to actively promote the production and sale of goods. Even though Yuan Shikai, the Zhili Governor-General, warned that the TCW would be transformed into a factory, but it was an avoidable choice for the stable operation of the TCW. In short, the TCW met two of the three criteria of Ogawa Shigejiro. The cost shortage was that the TCW could not be solved alone, and the Model Prison established under the guise of a “modern” prison also faced the same problem. Therefore, the TCW was a starting point for “modern” prison, rather than a transitional institution for “modern” prison.(Seoul National University/ pumkpie1@gmail.com)"

In-depth interviews were conducted with reporters working for daily newspapers, broadcasters, and news agencies. The results show that the reporters identified organizational issues as the key issue among the causes of misinformation. That is, the risk of misinformation increases because the press accelerates the competition for single and breaking news while operating the existing news production system as it is. As a specific measure, at the reporter level, faithful writing and re-establishing the role of journalists in the digital age were suggested. At the media level, the reporters suggested strengthening the online news consumption system, reinforcing continuous education in ethics, introducing various article formats and evaluation systems, and establishing an organization to respond to misinformation. At the level of external environment, the necessity of self-regulation to overcome partisanship and improvement of the portal news consumption environment was suggested. There were mixed arguments for and against including the press in the punitive damages claim system, but consensus was confirmed on the need to strengthen the responsibility of the press."

Therefore, an attempt is made to examine the relationship between participation in Global value chains (GVC) and Innovation Systems (IS) of different developed, Asian and developing countries depicting different stages of development. For the purpose, seemingly unrelated regression equation model is estimated for the manufacturing industries and it was found that in the initial stages of development, low-skilled labour, mediumskilled labour, process innovation and price level have significant impact on participation in global value chains (GVC) followed by the role of skilled labour and innovations in the advanced stages of development. It was also found that for building innovation systems (IS), the role of high-skilled labour predominates in the initial stages. However, in the later stages, participation in GVC with backward linkages also has a positive impact on building their innovation systems (IS). Specifically for South Korea with proximity in hightechnology intensive industries, the impact of high skilled labour, product and process innovation are significant in determining global value chain participation while the high-skilled labour and backward linkages played important role for building its innovation systems (IS). For India’s low-technology intensive industries, low skilled labour and price level have significant impact on its participation in global value chains whereas human capital have positive impact on its innovation systems (IS)."

The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of knowledge level on the AEC of Vietnamese small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the textile and apparel industry towards attitudes, readiness, and performance. This study uses convenience sampling to get questionnaires from 150 SMEs in Hanoi, Vietnam. Then, the paper applies SPSS-AMOS 24 to process data. The empirical results show that AEC’s implementation only has a small impact on improving SME performance. However, SMEs have adequate knowledge, attitude, and readiness about AEC. The structural modeling findings indicate that the knowledge factor has an indirect effect on SMEs’ performance.

This article explores that the development of China’s space industry resulted from the Chinese government’s efforts to link industrial policy and foreign economic policy. At the domestic level, the Chinese government implemented industrial policy targeted at the space industry in a dynamic way. At the external level, the Chinese government adroitly took advantage of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as a means to expand foreign markets and enhance the competitiveness of the space industry. Based on this premise, I highlight the way in which the Chinese government mobilized various policy tools to transform the space industry and create a new space ecosystem. Second, I examine that the Chinese government’s strategic use of the BRI for the development of the space industry. In particular, I focus on the BRI Space Information Corridor and Digital Silk Road (DSR) as a means of expanding the Chinese space industry’s overseas expansion. These initiatives helped Chinese space companies, which have secured technology and price competitiveness by preempting the domestic market, successfully secure the overseas space market."

Robust Adaptive Finite-time Fault-tolerant Control for Dynamic Positioning of Vessels,2021,"['Dynamic positioning', 'fault tolerant control', 'finite-time', 'thruster faults.']",,"In this paper, a novel robust adaptive finite-time fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme is presented for the dynamic positioning (DP) of vessels under thruster faults with unknown model parameters and environmental disturbances. The thruster effectiveness factor to express the loss-of-effectiveness fault state is transformed into a new unknown parameter, which is obtained by the adaptive law. Furthermore, based on the finite-time control technique, neural networks (NNs) technique and the sliding mode differentiator, a novel robust adaptive finite-time FTC strategy is developed for DP of vessels by resorting the backstepping design technique. It is theoretically proved that the proposed FTC scheme can force the vessel arrive at the desired position and heading in a finite time, while guaranteeing the boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop of DP control system. Simulation study results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FTC scheme."

Data from pertinent government reports, policy papers and indicators, statistical results, newspaper articles, bills of law were analyzed.As a result of the analysis, the flow of problems related to child abuse, the flow of politics, and the flow of policy were not completely combined for a long time. However, the so-called Jung In-i incident in October 2020 led to the formation of public opinion and the window of policy was opened. In this process, the child abuse reporter was a key policy leader. On the other hand, the interest and participation of public officials, who are policy leaders in the public domain, were insufficient and remained in a passive role to prevent incidents.To secure the effectiveness of child abuse prevention and protection policies, this study proposes a multifaceted cooperation system that includes the central government, local governments, education offices, police offices, the Ministry of Justice, and specialized child protection organizations, which will thereby transform the policy into an organic combination system.

Orlando is a male and then transforms into a female; however, he keeps his love for the Russian princess Sasha and becomes a bisexual as a woman who has passed the heart of a man. Woolf portrays the story of Orlando, who lives 342 years, in a fantasy format, modeling on her friend, Vita Sackville-west and her family. Orlando, liberated from the fixed gender role of patriarchal society, lives as a free female writer. On the other hand, Tiresias in The Waste Land cannot escape the role of a prophet who observes the world with wrinkled dugs. What he can feel is the role of only looking at the painful screams of women. However, Eliot shows the fear of a world stained with sexual assault through Marie, a narrator representing femininity and shouts thorough swallowing, retribution and revenge against men. Like the chess or warfare version, the world was just a mess and wasteland where violence and revenge were repeated. However, in a similar situation, Woolf seeks to correct a world divided into bisexual understanding, marriage and true love through Orlando.

Hicks’ early works, consisting of a series of “minimes”, were the results of her elaborate experiments with various techniques, materials, and colors based on the principles of weaving. In her works, colors, in conjunction with tactile nature of fibers, emerge as a major keyword. Her reinterpreted weaving techniques stand out in installation works as a fusion of design and pure art. By expanding the scale of work beyond the “minime” series, Hicks unfolds strong fabric properties through installation work. In addition, her architectural projects bring attention to the relationship between physical space and artistic objects. Hicks’ constant push to challenge the boundaries that separate the domain of fiber art gave birth to a more extensive and fused form of fiber art in which weaving is not merely a technique but also a metaphorical tool that can be transformed and expressed in various forms."

This study examined the correlation between the change in the media structure of the music industry and music videos in Korea.  The large-scale investment in music videos made in the 1990s suddenly declined in the early 2000s. And studio type music videos have increased significantly. The change in the type of music video needs to be explained by an analysis of the relationship between the change in the media structure and the type of music video. Due to the media’s Big Cross, eChanges such as the spread of single music releases, the decline of general record companies and the rise of music distribution companies, the diversification of the music industry’s profit model, the growth of entertainment agencies, and the lower barriers to market entry were made rapidly. The studio type music video is economically and time-efficient and it can be produced stably without the input of large capital. So it is suitable for the speed, economy, and efficiency required by the market centering on music industry.  In the future, as various media emerge, music videos become more diverse, and as they enter the global market, it can be expected that large-scale investments will gradually be made."

In addition, after reviewing the concept of InsurTech and its relevance to insurance-related laws and regulations, we consider how it would be desirable for the insurance industry to respond in the future.  In the insurance industry, a business model and structure change is required, such as the emergence of businesses using cutting-edge innovative technologies such as InsurTech. Such changes in the business environment can be a threat to the insurance industry and can also be a new business opportunity.  Until now, it is true that insurance companies have been passive and have hardly been able to actively manage risk after signing contracts with customers. However, in order to survive and develop in the insurance industry in the midst of innovative environmental changes, it is necessary to actively respond to the changed business environment. In other words, it is necessary to identify various risks such as legal issues related to the introduction of FinTech technology, prepare appropriate countermeasures, and be prepared to actively respond to innovative changes."

Despite the significant assessment of the vitality of various trees introduced within Seoullo 7017 for the first time, this study is limited in that the data used were measured only once in summer. In this regard, it raised the need for continuous interest in and monitoring of a special plant environment and development of proper maintenance and management techniques, along with follow-up research on seasonal and temperature conditions, soil moisture and root development conditions to supplement this research."

A Sense of Urgency, Core Competency, and Transformational Leadership are deducted as the determinants of successful DR by reviewing prior studies and the relevant management theories.A Sense of Urgency is a driving force that triggers and promotes DR. However, the ROK military failed to utilize it as a driving force for DR due to the frequent shift of main threats against ROK between North Korea and neighbouring countries depending on the government’s inclination. In order for the ROK military to succeed in DR, it must utilize the military power imbalance between the two Koreas after the North’s declaration of nuclear power state and the seriousness of escalating military power of neighbouring countries.Core Competency is a source of competitiveness that provides unique capabilities against a rival country or military. The ROK military tried to implement DR by utilizing its advanced science and technologies as Core Competency but the lack of resources and inconsistency of reform policies made it difficult to practically achieve the goal. In order for the ROK military to succeed in DR, it needs to determine the target country and the strategy of approach, secure adequate budget, and build a civil-government-military complex and fusion type DR systems.Transformational Leadership is the main driving force for DR. However, the ROK military has failed to demonstrate transformational leadership due to the inherent limitation of external reform model pushed by the ROK Government. In order for the ROK military to succeed in DR, military leaders with transformational leadership need toplay a leading role with establishing a clear vision and direction of the future DR."

Fast pulse current control of multiphase pulse power supply converters using feedback linearization,2021,"['Feedback linearization', 'Multiphase paralleled', 'Nonlinear control', 'Pulse power supply']",,"To improve the performance of multiphase pulse power supply (MPPS) converters, a current control strategy based on feedback linearization (FL) is proposed for flat-top current control by using an average model of the MPPS converter in thisstudy. A nonlinear state function model of a MPPS converter is presented and transformed to a linearized and decoupled form with the input–output feedback linearization technique. Based on the linearized system, simple linear controllers are designed to regulate the current among different phases and output current of the MPPS, which significantly reduces the difficulty in controller design and tuning. Moreover, a pre-charge method is adopted to improve current rising edge, which improves the current response of the flat-top current control. To test its effectiveness, the proposed strategy is employed in a 10 kW MPPS prototype. When compared to the conventional PI-based current control for MPPS converters, the proposed strategy provides a better dynamic performance in terms of current regulation and its flexibility can be extended to any of the paralleled phases of a MPPS system."
High frequency pulse injected double stage filtering method for linear permanent magnet motor position error compensation considering parameter asymmetry,2021,"['Error compensation', 'Double stage filtering method', 'Linear permanent magnet motor', 'Parameter asymmetry', 'Pulse injection method']",,"Due to machining errors and the effect of the longitudinal end of a stator, linear permanent magnet motors (LPMMs) produce asymmetric three-phase winding resistance and inductance. After a Park transformation of the asymmetric three-phase stator inductance, the dq axis inductance is not constant, and the dq axis is coupled. This leads to errors in estimating the motor position by the traditional pulse injection method. In this paper, the position estimation error caused by parameter asymmetry is analyzed to discuss the influence of LPMM asymmetric three-phase winding parameters on high frequency pulse injection sensorless method error. Moreover, a double stage filtering method is used to realize error compensation. On this basis, a simulation model was built by MATLAB/Simulink and experiments were carried out on a LPMM prototype under no-load conditions. The simulation and experimental results verify that the double stage filtering method can improve the position estimated accuracy and dynamic performance under sensorless control."
Two Simplified Methods for Galloping of Iced Transmission Lines,2021,"['Iced transmission lines', 'Multiscale method', 'Average method', 'Dynamic tension', 'Galloping characteristics']",,"For the galloping of iced transmission lines, the influences of two simplified methods of dynamic tension on the galloping characteristics of transmission lines are investigated. Based on the variational principle for Hamiltonian, the partial differential equation of galloping of iced transmission lines is derived, then it is transformed into ordinary differential equation by Galerkin method. Two different simplified methods are used to convert the partial differential equation into ordinary differential equation. One is to average the dynamic tension over the span length, then Galerkin method is used. The other is that Galerkin method is used to convert the partial differential equation into ordinary differential equation directly. Firstly, the influences of two simplified methods on coefficients of ordinary differential galloping equation are studied. Second, the influences of the bending stiffness on the first-order frequency have been researched. In addition, the average method of two degrees of freedom (DOFs) is proposed and the galloping characteristics of iced transmission lines are studied by using multiscale method and average method, then the results are compared with that obtained by using numerical method. The parameters analysis shows that the two simplified methods of dynamic tension have significant influences on the coefficients of the two DOFs ordinary differential equation. By comparing the coefficients of galloping equation obtained by the two simplified methods of dynamic tension, it can find that with the increasing of tension and span length, the influences of bending stiffness on in-plane and out-of-plane natural frequency becomes smaller and smaller. The results of multiscale method and average method both show that the two simplified methods of dynamic tension have certain influences on the frequency, phase and amplitude of galloping of iced transmission lines. The conclusions obtained by this paper would promote the perfection of theoretical modeling about iced transmission lines, and could also give some references to practical engineering."

The inherent, isolated cultural phenomena from specific region no longer gives favorable impression to people. Most developing countries rely on post-colonial theories and postmodern ‘thought models, and the urban marketing strategy demands new methodologies from artists and designers. In the free movement of time and place, cities must integrate various images and accept mutual heterogeneity as a place of continuous negotiation. In today's world the exchange of ideas, information, and culture is proceeding faster than at any point in history, and the isolated cultural phenomena occurring in a specific place no longer give the audience a good feeling. Most developing countries rely on post-colonial theories and postmodern thought models, and urban marketing strategies impose new methodologies on artists and designers. In the free movement of time and place, cities must integrate various images and accept mutual heterogeneity as a place of continuous negotiation. (Method) This course examines the values and theories of the era of vernacular design within a postmodernist structure of diversity, along with the interpretation of the post-colonial cultural criticism of vernacular design. In the next three chapters, the applicability of public design is explored through practical examples of public design in critical discourse, and the hybrid characteristics of vernacular design are categorized based on contemporary aesthetics, thereby presenting the direction. (Results) The following are the hybrid characteristics of vernacular design. First, based on the dialectical perspective of receptive aesthetics, it has the relational characteristics of physicality and avant-garde, and focuses on the restoration of humanity and empathy of users. Second, as a ruin aesthetic, it is accompanied by imagination of uncertainty and reconfiguration, and contextual reading of duality and uncertainty is required. Third, analogy, transformation, redistribution, and out-of-region characteristics of adaptive senses appear, and social expansion is expected. (Conclusions) Public city design is depended on the attitude of the designer, rather than technology and materials, or form or type; it is a reflection of the users themselves. Vernacular content is required for creativity and expandability of cultural reproduction in terms of globalization, urbanization, modernization, and migration in all cities in the world. Subsequently vernacular public design should also aim to nurture local tradition and a sense of community from the point of everyday values and thoughts. However, the writer has expectation over continuous discussion that could materialize the value of the hybrid characteristics of Vernacular design as a mutual cooperation system rather than privatization of public goods."

Firstly, considering the nonlinear friction between the roll gaps, a torsional vibration model of the main drive system of rolling mill is established. Then, with the asymmetric performance constraints transformation, the motor torque control law is proposed based on backstepping algorithm. By introducing an adaptive bound estimation approach, the multipleunknown parameters caused by the sensor sensitivities can be approximated with very few adaptive laws. The dynamic surface technology is introduced to simplified the control design procedure and solve the computational explosion problem. It is strictly proved that the resulting closed-loop system is stable in the sense of uniformly ultimately boundedness and both transient and steady-state performances of the load speed are preserved. Finally, the simulation is provided to show the validity and the advantages of the proposed techniques."

Layer-adapted meshes for solute dispersion in a steady flow through an annulus with wall absorption: Application to a catheterized artery,2021,"['dispersion', 'finite difference scheme', 'convection', 'boundary absorption', 'catheterized artery', '“Shishkin” mesh']",,"This paper describes the longitudinal dispersion of passive tracer molecules injected in a steady, fully developed, viscous, incompressible, laminar flow through an annular pipe with a first order heterogeneous boundary absorption at the outer wall, numerically using layer-adapted meshes. The model is based on steady advection-diffusion equation with Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions. The solutions are discussed in the form of iso-concentration contours of the tracer molecules in the vertical plane. An artanh transformation is used to convert the infinite domain into a finite one. A combination of central finite difference and 2-point upwind scheme is adopted to solve the governing advection-diffusion equation. It is shown that how the mixing of tracers is affected by the shear flow, aspect ratio and the first-order boundary absorption. When the flow becomes convection dominated, the monotone finite difference on a uniform mesh does not work properly, so a layer-adapted mesh, namely a “Shishkin” mesh, is used to capture the layer phenomena at the different downstream stations. The present results are compared with existing experimental and numerical data and we have earned an excellent agreement with them. It is observed that, due to the use of layer adapted mesh, we have achieved a better agreement with the experimental data than some other previous results available in the literature, especially in the closest downstream location. The results of this study are likely to be of interest to understand the basic mechanism of dispersion process of solute in blood through a catheterized artery with an absorptive arterial wall."

Thereafter, a theory was developed based on inductive reasoning - namely the hook, upward push, and downward pull to elucidate a holistic picture of how big-data implications alongside social phenomena may have influenced the well-being trend."
Non-Newtonian Casson pulsatile fluid flow influenced by Lorentz force in a porous channel with multiple constrictions: A numerical study,2021,"['double constricted channel', 'Casson fluid', 'pulsatile flow', 'vorticity-stream function', 'finite difference method']",,"In this paper, we investigate non-Newtonian Casson fluid flow with pulsation in a channel having symmetrical constriction bumps on the upper and lower walls. The medium is assumed to be porous, following Darcy’s law. The fluid is modeled as electrically low conducting, and the pulsatile flow is subjected to a transverse magnetic field of uniform strength to study the impact of the resulting Lorentz force. We transform the mathematical model using the vorticity-stream function form for obtaining the solution. We analyze influence of the Hartman, Strouhal, Casson fluid, and porosity parameters on various flow profiles. It is revealed that the region of flow separation in the wake of a constriction bump tends to vanish with increasing the magnetic field parameter as well as Casson fluid parameter. The wall shear stress has higher values at the first constriction bump than that at the second constriction bump on a wall. It is also noticed that wall shear stress decreases with increasing the value of the porosity parameter during the pulsation cycle."

In our proposed model, a policyholder pays the fixed insurance fee. Based on the integral transform techniques, we derive the analytic integral equations for the optimal surrender boundary and the value function of the VA contract that can be solved numerically by recursive integration method. We provide numerical values for the value function, the optimal surrender boundary, and the expected optimal surrender time."
귀촌인들의 영농전환 의향 영향요인 분석,2021,"['귀촌인', 'urban-to-rural migrant', '귀촌 실태조사', 'urban-to-rural migrants survey', '영농전환 의향', 'intention of transition to farming', '귀농', 'urban-to-rural farming']",,"This paper identified various factors causing urban-to-rural migrants to have the intention of farming. The 2019 urban-to-rural migrants survey showed that 12.3% of the migrants with no experience of farming had the intention of farming. If this intention transforms into action, the transition will make up for a gradual decrease of urban-to-rural farming. This paper’s analysis was based on the microdata of the 2016 urban-to-rural migrants survey with 1006 samples―the only microdata of the year available. The specific factors were selected and made as variables in a model from the survey questionnaire considering the urban-to-rural migration-related, economic, sociocultural, and demographic aspects. Preparation duration, education, and governmental policy in the urban-to-rural migration- related aspect were statistically significant. Family income prospects, agriculture- related jobs, and business start-up experience in the economic aspect were statistically significant. Relationship with other residents and satisfaction levels in the sociocultural aspect and the number of family in the demographic information were statistically significant. All the statistically significant variables were positive except business start-up experience. Implications were added based on the results."

The TR pattern technique (Transformational Reconstruction), which reconstructs from a 2D circular flat pattern to a flat pattern that combines 3D draping, was analyzed for the characteristics of five formative elements such as line, surface, shape, color, and material. Dart Manipulation Technique, 3D Vortex, 3D patter puzzle, surface-to-surface overlapping and incision, Origami pocket, Box Integration, Box Integration Advanced, Architectural Reconstruction, which expresses geometric shapes in three dimensions. There are a total of 11 types, including Flared and Gathered Volumes that give the effect of incisions with color matching, Twisted layers TR Draping, and TR Sleeve Draping that give shape change and draping effect with different materials. The following four types of work were selected: 3D Vortex, 3D Box Integration, 3D Pattern Puzzle, and Origami Pockets. Apart from the existing method of partial emphasis and regular changes, it gave a more radical 3D effect by giving differences in the angle, length, and height of the model with the overall change of a silhouette. In addition, since the type and shape project a feeling similar to the physical and psychological effects of the line and surface, the relationship between the line and the surface was developed into a three-dimensional shape. Beyond a flat pattern which a bodily size is applied as a mathematical development method, this study has significance in that it presented a 3D silhouette that can be harmonized with the silhouette of the human body by actively applying formative elements for the structural 3D realization of various models in a variety of ways."

LLC inverter design for driving surface DBD optimized for airborne bacteria inactivation,2021,"['LLC inverter', 'Plasma generation', 'Surface dielectric barrier discharge', 'Sterilization', 'Airborne bacteria']",,"This paper proposes a design for an LLC resonant inverter with reflecting plasma characteristics to improve indoor air quality. A surface dielectric barrier discharge (SDBD) helps improve indoor air quality since it effectively inactivates airbornebacteria. By collaborating with plasma physics and power electronics, this study electrically models the SDBD structure. Thus, it presents a compact and commercially viable plasma generation circuit to drive the SDBD feature. The traditionalLLC inverter design procedure is not optimized for such an application due to utilization differences. An LLC resonant inverter operating in the resonant mode combined with a step-up transformer is optimally designed to generate a 4-kVpk-pk, 7.8-kHz sinusoidal voltage with a total power consumption of less than 2.5 W. By investigating optical emission spectroscopy (OES), the production of a reactive species for the inactivation of airborne bacteria is confirmed. Furthermore, thesterilization performance is tested by observing the removal rate of the Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) bacteria inside a 1 m3 chamber."

One sign which connects these themes is a woman, which is represented and re-represented amidst the ideology battle between the right-wing and left-wing alpha males in the various forms of art—a novel, a play and a film. Most of this play enacts the film version of Mehta’s novel. The remaining parts show the actors’ interactions in the film studio. The play’s representations of women including both the film scenes and the studio scenes are not pro-woman despite the outbursts of feminist art and scholarship at the time when Hare wrote this play. The representation of Peggy, the early twenties jazz violinist, who is the main female character of the play, is stereotypical in that she is anti-intellect and pro-sensual. Peggy is the parody of a sexually liberated American woman of the 70s. Even though the real-life Peggy complains that the film sensationalises the one-night stand and claims that she outgrows the immature former self, she does not show much more emotional and intellectual maturity than the film version of Peggy. Even though real women can be distorted and misrepresented due to male writers and directors’ slanted perspectives, in A Map of the World, there is no evidence that positive female role models do exist in the world outside the novel and film. Even though Hare, a sharp critic of the dated British conventions and values, explores alternative values and dreams of the utopia through his plays, at least in this play, women have no place in his visions."

While fundamentally different from the existing premium strategy, these two brands reorganized the topography of the home appliance market and transformed the kitchen landscape of ordinary households through a unique route.Methods This study was conducted mainly on literature research. We tried to examine the change process of domestic double-door refrigerators for 10 years since the first release of Zipel in relation to design strategies, and to find out the socio-cultural factors that made the process possible.Results The process can be divided into three main periods. ① From 1997 to 1999, doubledoor refrigerators of Zipel and Dios were launched, competing with imported products and settling down in the market ② From 2000 to 2004, they attempted to change their design with ""interiortype home appliances"" and ""system home appliances"", gradually increasing their market share and leading to the advancement of home appliances. ③ From 2005 to 2006, they emerged as a mainstream model in the market, forming a confrontation between ""fashion appliances"" and ""art appliances”. This above process secured its own driving force by closely interacting with socio-cultural factors such as polarization of consumption, transformation of housewife identity, reorganization of apartment kitchen space, and increase of large discount stores at each stage.Conclusions Zipel’s and Dios’ refrigerators were able to enter the center of the market under the influence of polarization of consumption after the IMF financial crisis. After that, They could present a new lifestyle while establishing a dynamic relationship with changes in consumers, kitchen space, and cold chain systems."

In the context of COVID-19 which has made digital transformation inevitable, the importance of mobile work behaviors - performing work tasks through mobile devices - is further highlighted. Drawing from the behavioral immune system theory and cognitive appraisal theory of emotions, this study proposes that individual workers’ concern about getting infected by COVID-19 will be negatively related to job satisfaction but positively related to mobile work behaviors. We further propose that leaders’ communality and agency trait will be positively related to both job satisfaction and the increase of mobile work behaviors. Analyses of a matched dataset comprising survey data and mobile application usage data from 407 workers showed that their leaders’ agency and communality were significantly related to the workers’ job satisfaction. However, their mobile productivity was significantly related only to the communality of their leaders. The results of this study will provide useful theoretical and practical implications for researchers and managers who aim to understand and promote the technology adoption and knowledge productivity of workers in a pandemic situation."

Xiaozhuang(曉莊) School, Shanhai-gongxuetuan(山海工學團), and Yucai(育才) School that he ran represented the education dissemination movement that were far from Guomindang’s education policy. Therefore, this study examines Tao Xingzhi’s Life Education Theory and Mass Education Movement from the perspective of transformation and sinicization of the western sciences and thoughts.  Tao Xingzhi as an educator and anti-Japanese activist showed his devotion to the public, creativity for education, and enthusiasm and actions to save his nation. He was ideologically based on democracy and nationalism, and emphasized real actions and directivity toward the public rather than ideological pursuits. The Life Education Theory was suggested as an educational model for China’s rural area by unifying Dewey’s pragmatism and Wang Yangming’s knowledge-action unity. Specifically, he pursued that “teaching, learning, and practice are combined into one,” which sought to match knowledge and labor in life. This was realized within Xiaozhuang School’s rural education movement and Shanhai-gongxuetuan’s and Yucai School’s education dissemination movement. Throughout the process, ‘Yiyouzhi(藝友制)’ and ‘Little Teacher System(小先生制)’ were set as main educational methods. Yiyouzhi was derived from apprenticeship, and Little Teacher System was the real practice of the way in which one learns a thing and then transmits it to others.  During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Tao Xingzhi was very active for the anti-Japanese movement. He thought that the national liberation and the people’s liberation were not separable, so he was very much interested in educating farmers and laborers and strived for freedom of speechㆍpublicationㆍassemblyㆍassociation. He criticised Nanjing Government’s educational policy, but did not deny customs and ethics, and Goumintang itself. He overcame traditional education, and propelled Mass Education Movement depending on Life Education Theory which he transformed the pragmatist education into China’s circumstance.  Tao Xingzhi did not put individual freedom and equality ahead of national security. Nevertheless, he showed an educator’s perception that he did not give up the minimum indispensable freedom directly related to human survival and creativity. He was both ideologically and politically unbiased. He was, however, a China-first pragmatic educator who was interested in any ideology for the survival of the people and the revival of the nation."

The additive NP-Dy2O3 has a size of about 10 nm and presents a para/ferromagnetic transition at about 300 K. The characterization of samples was probed via XRD, TEM, SEM, DC magnetization, and AC susceptibility measurements. Some models were employed to compute superconducting parameters like intragranular critical current density under a magnetic field (Jcm(H)), the density of intragranular pinning force for Abrikosov vortex (εg(0)), intergranular critical current density (Jc,inter), intergranular electrical character, superconductor grain volume fraction (fs). The correlation between these parameters and microstructure was discussed. The inclusion of NP-Dy2O3 does not alter the structural properties and the spatial growth of YBa2Cu3O7-δ. NP-Dy2O3 addition led to significant enhancements of Jcm(H) and εg(0).The decrement in Jc,inter was attributed to the change of grain boundary characteristics that transformed from SNS to SINS junction due to NP-Dy2O3 addition."
Evaluation and Prediction on the Hydraulic Abrasion Performance of High Belite Cement-Based Concrete,2021,"['Abrasion', 'High belite cement (HBC)', 'Surface topography', 'Fractal dimension', 'Projection Pursuit Regression (PPR)']",,"High belite cement (HBC) concrete is increasingly applied to the hydraulic projects, where much attention should be paid to the abrasion performance. In this paper, the mass loss, abrasion rate and morphology indexes such as depth of abrasion, volume loss and fractal dimension of HBC-based concrete at different wear periods were determined through underwater method. Moreover, a new method by transforming the survey area of worn surface was put forward to simulating practical erosion conditions, based on which, the abrasion performance prediction model was built by Projection Pursuit Regression (PPR) theory. Results show that the compounding addition of 30% mineral admixtures had little contribution to the abrasion resistance of HBC concrete after being long-term cured, while reducing water-binder (w/b) ratios was still an effective way for improving that. The worn surface of concrete specimens was divided into three regions for abrade zone, transitional zone and sound zone, and the abrasion evolution was found to be related to the wear duration and space position. Furthermore, there were good correlations between mass loss rate, depth of abrasion, volume loss and fractal dimension, and the fitting formulas were also proposed with good coefficients. Eventually, the PPR model based on the data of transformed survey area was proved to be a promising approach for predicting the abrasion performance."

Some simplifying assumptions without loss of accuracy are employed. The considered force model is constructed. Then the Delaunay canonical set is introduced. The Hamiltonian of the problem is obtained then it is expressed in terms of the Deluanay canonical set. The Hamiltonian is re-ordered to adopt it to the perturbation technique used to solve the problem. The Lie transform method is surveyed. The Hamiltonian is doubly averaged. The resonance capture is investigated. Finally, some numerical simulations are illustrated and are analyzed. Many resonant inclinations are revealed."
인공지능을 이용한 국악 멜로디 생성기에 관한 연구,2021,[],,"In the field of music, various AI composition methods using machine learning have recently been attempted. However, most of this research has been centered on Western music, and little research has been done on Korean traditional music. Therefore, in this paper, we will create a data set of Korean traditional music, create a melody using three algorithms based on the data set, and compare the results. Three models were selected based on the similarity between language and music, LSTM, Music Transformer and Self Attention. Using each of the three models, a melody generator was modeled and trained to generate melodies. As a result of user evaluation, the Self Attention method showed higher preference than the other methods. Data set is very important in AI composition. For this, a Korean traditional music data set was created, and AI composition was attempted with various algorithms, and this is expected to be helpful in future research on AI composition for Korean traditional music."

In order to improve the quality of information, it is necessary to rapidly sort useful information and post-process data. This processed information can be transformed into higher knowledge that is utilized by a greater community beyond the individual in a setting where the knowledge can be exchanged freely. Digitization has emerged as a hot topic in all industries to support the needs of processing and improving the qualities of large amounts of data in modern society. However, the current construction industry with a 2D recording system remains in the traditional paradigm, subdividing to represent various types of information without fully digitizing information of each facility. This is the lowest level of information form which is simply listing phenomena or facts. This does not only prevent relating information but also limits the conversation into social knowledge because it depends on the tacit knowledge of a specific expert. To improve this situation, the BIM (Building Information Modeling) system has appeared in the field of architecture to improve the quality of existing construction information by technically supporting data filtering, information processing, knowledge sharing, and expansion to a digital platform. By combining these technologies, BIM drawing can increase the efficiency of information delivery, the flexibility of reflection, the economic feasibility of writing tasks, and the scalability of digital use, and improve the limitations of the current traditional book system. However, it seems that BIM is not fully applied in practice due to various obstacles that prevent its practical implementation. Today's architecture is becoming more sophisticated due to additional factors such as environmental friendliness, economic feasibility, and smart systems in addition to the original three required elements (structure, function, and beauty) that have been traditionally required. In order to adhere to the introduction of a new system in response to the ever-increasing requirements and the changing technological environment, the true change will start from clearly recognizing the limitations of the existing system and clearly understanding the background and possibility of the new technology."

The Joseon Dynasty attempted to cultivate and practice Neo-Confucian morality through the Clan Code with Neo-Confucianism as its ruling ideology. As part of such efforts, they continued efforts to transform Namgwiyeoga (the custom by which the bridegroom lived in the bride's house), which was a marriage custom in the early Joseon period, into Chinyeongnye (the custom by which the bridegroom brought the bride from her house to live together in his home). However, even by the late Joseon Dynasty, a complete Chinyeongnye was not achieved, and Ban-chinyeongnye marriage customs were practiced under the influence of Namgwiyeoga marriage.The novel < Jeongeulseonjeon > conceals this Banchinyeong marriage customs in the conflict structure. In order to examine this in more detail, this study first explored the overall conflict structure of the work. The composition of the paragraphs of the conflict in the first part of the work adopted the abusive motif of the step-model family novel to realize obstacle to marriage, while the composition of the paragraphs of the conflict in the second part borrowed the story of the affection conflict between the wife and the concubine in order to resolve the chaos of the position of the lawful wife in relation to 'obstacle to marriage' described in the first part.< Jeongeulseonjeon > is a work with a conflict structure of the close-knit association, and it embodies the ritual of Banchinyeongnye in this conflict structure. Considering the situation in the Ikju region, where the foundation of the bride's home completely collapsed, she is deemed to have lost her rights as the daughter. Considering the situation at Jeongeulseon's husband's home, her rights and position as the daughter-in-law or legitimate wife were more secured, so it was understood that the meaning of marriage customs, converting to a paternal-centered society that excludes maternal lineage and wife lineage, was concealed in the work."

With conventional welding robots, welding is performed only at the designated welding points through robot teaching; however, the difficulty with this method is that the position of the welding point changes due to the tolerance (gap) of the welding object. To solve this problem, we automatically recognized the welding points using a deep learning-based object detection model called YOLOv4. The time required for labeling was thus reduced through a deep learning labeling tool that uses an existing learned weights file. To control the robot with the recognized welding point, a hand/eye calibration method calculating the homogeneous transformation matrix between the robot and the camera was adopted. Additionally, to correct the final robot control error caused due to calibration and camera depth errors, the control precision at the welding point was improved through interpolation method. The system has been verified by conducting sufficient number of experiments in a non-destructive formwork welding environment."

For our research, we collected a list of identified arguments from online debates and attempted to use unsupervised methods to create a list of common justifications for each argument stance in each domain. We propose a model that clusters arguments by subtopics, or justifications, and then extracts the list of representative words for argument facets from each cluster. We were able to improve clustering performance by using a combination of three different similarity matrices (cosine similarity between BERT sentence embeddings, semantic textual similarity, and similarity between topic probability distributions) for the clustering algorithm. Our clustering produced 5%p and 7.5%p of ARI and V-measure values on average, which outperforms previous work in two of four domains. Additionally, we used a Transformer model to utilize the attention weights to discover argument facets, and we observed better performances compared to the method without attention weights."

The proposed MDCNN consists of time-domain, frequency-domain, and statistical-domain feature channels. The Time-domain channel is to model the hidden patterns of signals in the time domain. The frequency-domain channel uses Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) to obtain the rich feature representations of signals in the frequency domain. The statistic-domain channel contains six statistical variables, which is to reflect the signals’ macro statistical-domain features, respectively. Firstly, in the proposed MDCNN, time-domain and frequency-domain channels are processed by CNN individually with various filters. Secondly, the CNN extracted features from time, and frequency domains are merged as time-frequency features. Lastly, time-frequency domain features are fused with six statistical variables as the comprehensive features for identifying the fault. Thereby, the proposed method could make full use of those three domain-features for fault diagnosis while keeping high distinguishability due to CNN's utilization. The authors designed massive experiments with 10-folder cross-validation technology to validate the proposed method's effectiveness on the CWRU bearing data set. The experimental results are calculated by ten-time averaged accuracy. They have confirmed that the proposed MDCNN could intelligently, accurately, and timely detect the fault under the complex manufacturing environments, whose accuracy is nearly 100%."
A Decentralized Approach to Education Powered by Blockchain Technology,2021,"['Blockchain Technology', 'Decentralisation', 'Higher Education', 'Lifelong Learning', 'Online Education']",,"Recently, some researchers in the field of education have been interested in the applications of Blockchain technology. While some researchers have conducted on the ‘academic certificate handling’ or ‘managing record-keeping’ in which are detailed educational administrative sector, others are more interested in reshaping educational landscape based on the key concept of ‘decentralization’ of Blockchain technology in a larger educational context. Researchers believe that the current centralized learning system or educational model is no longer sustainable, and that the Blockchain technology allows for a total disintermediation and disaggregation of education, specifically in higher education including lifelong learning. In a similar context, this paper will explore how the concept of ‘decentralization’, which is core concept of Blockchain technology, can transform the landscape of education, specifically focusing on the suggestions of researchers at Knowledge Media Institute at the open university in the UK. In other words, it will investigate how this new paradigm of Blockchain technology can affect on educational domain. To achieve this purpose, firstly, the basic Blockchain technology will be scrutinized, followed by the current major research outcome of educational applications of Blockchain technology will be reviewed. Finally, the implications and future prospects of educational applications of the Blockchain technology will be discussed."
Decorin: a multifunctional proteoglycan involved in oocyte maturation and trophoblast migration,2021,"['Decorin', 'Extracellular matrix', 'Implantation', 'Oocyte', 'Oogenesis', 'Proteoglycan', 'Trophoblasts']",,"Decorin (DCN) is a proteoglycan belonging to the small leucine-rich proteoglycan family. It is composed of a protein core containing leucine repeats with a glycosaminoglycan chain consisting of either chondroitin sulfate or dermatan sulfate. DCN is a structural component of connective tissues that can bind to type I collagen. It plays a role in the assembly of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and it is related to fibrillogenesis. It can interact with fibronectin, thrombospondin, complement component C1, transforming growth factor (TGF), and epidermal growth factor receptor. Normal DCN expression regulates a wide range of cellular processes, including proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and autophagy, through interactions with various molecules. However, its aberrant expression is associated with oocyte maturation, oocyte quality, and poor extravillous trophoblast invasion of the uterus, which underlies the occurrence of preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. Spatiotemporal hormonal control of successful pregnancy should regulate the concentration and activity of specific proteins such as proteoglycan participating in the ECM remodeling of trophoblastic and uterine cells in fetal membranes and uterus. At the human feto-maternal interface, TGF-β and DCN play crucial roles in the regulation of trophoblast invasion of the uterus. This review summarizes the role of the proteoglycan DCN as an important and multifunctional molecule in the physiological regulation of oocyte maturation and trophoblast migration. This review also shows that recombinant DCN proteins might be useful for substantiating diverse functions in both animal and in vitro models of oogenesis and implantation."

"Kinetics, Isotherm and Adsorption Mechanism Studies of Letrozole Loaded Modified and Biosynthesized Silver Nanoparticles as a Drug Delivery System: Comparison of Nonlinear and Linear Analysis",2021,"['Silver nanoparticles', 'Cysteine', 'Drug delivery', 'Letrozole', 'Non-linear and linear']",,"We prepared and investigated a biosynthesized nanoparticulate system with high adsorption and release capacity of letrozole. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were biosynthesized using olive leaf extract. Cysteine was capped AgNPs to increase the adsorption capacity and suitable interaction between nanoparticles and drug. Morphology and size of nanoparticles were confirmed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Nanoparticles were spherical with an average diameter of less than 100 nm. Cysteine capping was successfully confirmed by Fourier transform infrared resonance (FTIR) spectroscopy and elemental analysis (CHN). Also, the factors of letrozole adsorption were optimized and the linear and non-linear forms of isotherms and kinetics were studied. Confirmation of the adsorption data of letrozole by cysteine capped nanoparticles in the Langmuir isotherm model indicated the homogeneous binding site of modified nanoparticles surface. Furthermore, the adsorption rate was kinetically adjusted to the pseudo-second-order model, and a high adsorption rate was observed, indicating that cysteine coated nanoparticles are a promising adsorbent for letrozole delivery. Finally, the kinetic release profile of letrozole loaded modified nanoparticles in simulated gastric and intestinal buffers was studied. Nearly 40% of letrozole was released in simulated gastric fluid with pH 1.2, in 30 min and the rest of it (60%) was released in simulated intestinal fluid with pH 7.4 in 10 h. These results indicate the efficiency of the cysteine capped AgNPs for adsorption and release of drug letrozole for breast cancer therapy."

Consequentially, the cases of residents’ participatory energy planning in the municipalities had frequently been identified. Particularly, the current government of Moon Jae-in asked the whole regional local governments to establish their energy plan in the way of citizen’s participation. In this context, this study attempts to analyze the planning process of Gyeonggi province which adopted its unique participatory method from the viewpoint of learning effect of democracy. In addition, the concept of energy citizenship was adopted to evaluate the overall participation process. Gyeonggi province, unlike other regions that focused on the representativeness of ordinary citizens, built a planning model in which citizens with energy knowledge participate as local representatives, thereby cultivating active energy citizens not the bystanders, and ensured even the execution ability of the plan. In other words, since the participation process was considered as a learning space for grassroots democracy, practical citizens who acquired information and knowledge related to energy policy could grow as the implementing agent of the local energy plan. Additionally the participation process and contents were designed so that their learning effect can be developed into the energy transformation activities after the establishment of the plan. Also Gyeonggi province attempted to establish the linkage between the regional local government and primary local governments to strengthen the policy cooperation. Based on the argument that the success of citizen participation should be evaluated by the effect of facilitating social learning, the case of Gyeonggi-do appears to have achieved meaningful results and has distinctive characteristics from cases in other regions."
Power Allocation Method of Downlink Non-orthogonal Multiple Access System Based on α Fair Utility Function,2021,"['Ergodic Sum Rate', 'NOMA', 'Power Allocation', 'α Fair Utility Function']",,"The unbalance between system ergodic sum rate and high fairness is one of the key issues affecting the performance of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a power allocation algorithm to realize the ergodic sum rate maximization of NOMA system. The scheme is mainly achieved by the construction algorithm of fair model based on α fair utility function and the optimal solution algorithm based on the interior point method of penalty function. Aiming at the construction of fair model, the fair target is added to the traditional power allocation model to set the reasonable target function. Simultaneously, the problem of ergodic sum rate and fairness in power allocation is weighed by adjusting the value of α. Aiming at the optimal solution algorithm, the interior point method of penalty function is used to transform the fair objective function with unequal constraints into the unconstrained problem in the feasible domain. Then the optimal solution of the original constrained optimization problem is gradually approximated within the feasible domain. The simulation results show that, compared with NOMA and time division multiple address (TDMA) schemes, the proposed method has larger ergodic sum rate and lower Fairness Index (FI) values."
Remote sensing based forest canopy opening and their spatial representation,2021,"['Remote sensing', 'canopy opening', 'vegetation indexes', 'Tasseled Cap']",,"The use of remote sensing in natural resource management is an easily accessible input for obtaining detailed information on the ground and landscape. There is a wide range of procedures to analyze the forest canopy through satellite images. The purpose of this work is to obtain a map of forest opening with remote sensing by relating several vegetation indices, Kauth-Thomas transformation and texture filters, to a Landsat 8OLI image. A factor analysis was made to evaluate the contribution of these variable to identify the opening of the forest cover, yielding a r2 ¼ 76%. The results show that the Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and brightness factor have the best correlation (0.225–0.216 component coefficient). The resulting model was reclassified into five categories of forest opening and associated with land use data from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI-M exico). Thus, 95% of human settlements have a canopy opening between medium and very high, the crops areas 72%, and the low deciduous forest with secondary shrub vegetation 100% of the opening. Coniferous and mixed forests have a low to very low canopy opening 46% and 55%, respectively of their surface. The forests with secondary vegetation, both shrub and arboreal, present greater openness than the same forests in the primary state. Verification of the spatial representation data of canopy opening was made by comparing 94 hemispheric photographs with 94 sites located in open areas obtaining an r ¼ 0.57. This work offers a simple and straightforward methodology, easily replicable in different types of vegetation using free satellite imagery. Hence, it is a helpful tool for decision-makers when considering the general status of conservation of forest systems and their spatial distribution."
A Comparative Study of Ni (II) Removal from Aqueous Solutions on Ca-Alginate Beads and Alginate-Impregnated Hemp Fibers,2021,"['Biosorption', 'Ni (II)', 'Ca-alginate', 'Hemp fiber', 'Wastewater treatment']",,"Ca-alginate particles (CA) and alginate-impregnated hemp fibers (AH) (both, as prepared, dried, and rehydrated)were used as adsorbents for removal of Ni (II) ions from water. Adsorption was examined in the batch system andexperimentally obtained data were analyzed by both linear and nonlinear curve fitting using pseudo-first and pseudo-secondorderrate, as well as Langmuir, Freundlich, and Sips equations. The concentration of Ni (II) ions was measured by atomicabsorption spectrophotometry, while the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used for characterization of adsorbentsurface, before and after the adsorption. Although all tested samples showed similar adsorption capacities of 12 mg/g, it wasfound that rehydration improves adsorption characteristics of AH and increases the removal efficiency above 90 %.Adsorption of Ni (II) ions can be sufficiently described by both kinetic models and Sips isotherm equation, and this relativelyfast process presumably occurs through the mechanism of physisorption and ion-exchange. The obtained results proved thatCa-alginate particles and alginate-impregnated hemp fibers have good potential to reduce nickel concentrations in a costeffectiveand efficient manner."

First, an autoencoder is used to detect the presence of damage. The autoencoder model is trained using the vibration data of the healthy composite structure. The vibration data of a healthy composite structure is input to the trained autoencoder model with the data of a damaged composite structure, and errors between the input and output data are compared to detect the presence of damage. Second, a convolutional neural network model is used to classify the healthy and damaged composite structures with two different damage locations. This study confirms that the proposed technique can effectively detect and locate damage in composite structures."
도로터널에서 수소 연료차 수소탱크 폭발시 폭발압력에 대한 기초적 연구,2021,['TNT'],,"Hydrogen fuel is emerging as an new energy source to replace fossil fuels in that it can solve environmental pollution problems and reduce energy imbalance and cost. Since hydrogen is eco-friendly but highly explosive, there is a high concern about fire and explosion accidents of hydrogen fueled vehicles. In particular, in semi-enclosed spaces such as tunnels, the risk is predicted to increase. Therefore, this study was conducted on the applicability of the equivalent TNT model and the numerical analysis method to evaluate the hydrogen explosion pressure in the tunnel. In comparison and review of the explosion pressure of 6 equivalent TNT models and Weyandt's experimental results, the Henrych equation was found to be the closest with a deviation of 13.6%. As a result of examining the effect of hydrogen tank capacity (52, 72, 156 L) and tunnel cross-section (40.5, 54, 72, 95 m<sup>2</sup>) on the explosion pressure using numerical analysis, the explosion pressure wave in the tunnel initially it propagates in a hemispherical shape as in open space. Furthermore, when it passes the certain distance it is transformed a plane wave and propagates at a very gradual decay rate. The Henrych equation agrees well with the numerical analysis results in the section where the explosion pressure is rapidly decreasing, but it is significantly underestimated after the explosion pressure wave is transformed into a plane wave. In case of same hydrogen tank capacity, an explosion pressure decreases as the tunnel cross-sectional area increases, and in case of the same cross-sectional area, the explosion pressure increases by about 2.5 times if the hydrogen tank capacity increases from 52 L to 156 L. As a result of the evaluation of the limiting distance affecting the human body, when a 52 L hydrogen tank explodes, the limiting distance to death was estimated to be about 3 m, and the limiting distance to serious injury was estimated to be 28.5~35.8 m."

After the phosphorylation of corn stalks (PCS), the pHpzc decreased to 3.82, confirming the attachment of acidic functional groups onto the surface of the corn stalks. The pseudo-second-order and Langmuir isothermal models were found to be suitable for modeling the adsorption kinetics and conducting isothermal experiments of the adsorption of Pb(II) onto PCS. The maximum adsorption capacity of Langmuir was 182.76 mg/g. The adsorption process involving PCS was close to physical adsorption, and the adsorption efficiency increased as the temperature increased. According to a Fourier transform infrared analysis, phosphorylation increased the number of carboxyl groups (-COOH) on the corn stalks. In addition, the phosphoric acid group expanded the pore shape of the adsorbent to increase the exposure of anions to the surface. Consequently, the adsorption efficiency of Pb(II), a cationic ion, onto PCS increased."

Herein, a hierarchical porous and hydrophilic H1.6Mn1.6O4@chitosan pellet (HMO@CP) is proposed and its mechanical property is tailored through the glutaraldehyde-derived cross-linking. Different characterization techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunner-Emmet-Teller (BET) measurement, Fourier transformation infrared spectrum (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) meter were used to investigate the chemical and morphological properties of the HMO@CP. H1.6Mn1.6O4 powders were successfully encapsulated by chitosan, forming composite porous pellets. The equilibrium adsorption capacity of HMO@CP is 49.2mg·g1, which is similar to that of the pristine H1.6Mn1.6O4. Moreover, the adsorption behavior of HMO@CP well fits with the pseudosecond- order kinetic model, and the Langmuir model can be used to describe the adsorption isotherm of HMO@CP.Furthermore, the adsorption thermodynamic parameters such as H, G and S were calculated based on the obtained results. When the pellet is immersed into 0.05mol·L1 HCl solution after the Li+ adsorption process, the desorption equilibrium can be reached within 60 min, with a manganese dissolution loss of 2.48%. The Li+ adsorption capacity of HMO@CP remains at 41.92mg·g1 after five adsorption-desorption cycles, confirming the effective regeneration property of the HMO@CP. In addition, the as-prepared HMO@CP shows excellent selectivity for Li+ among Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ ions in the simulated solution."

This is developed using the feed-forward nonlinear backpropagation Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm that determines the actual status of the mutually coupled lines. The remote terminal units connected to the current and voltage transformers are used to acquire the appropriate data. The proposed scheme also carefully determines the ground distance element reach settings by calculating the apparent impedance while considering mutual coupling for all practical system confi gurations from the ANN; this eliminates the need for a compensation factor. The results of the apparent impedance (R + jX) calculated by the proposed adaptive and the conventional schemes, showed an average percentage error of (0.06% and 0.02%) and (15% and 41.5%) respectively. Having obtained this result, the performance of the proposed adaptive scheme showed the exact fault location with a higher accuracy when compared with a compensated conventional scheme"

Therefore, I want to analyze the control landscape identified only in the period of the Three Han Dynasty to reveal the emergence and transformation of the control landscape of the Korean Peninsula.The term ‘Imitated Bronze Mirror(倣製鏡)’ is generally described as ‘a model mirror’ by imitating the Han Dynasty’s mirror(漢鏡) during the period BC. In particular, it was mainly produced in the Yeongnam region of the Korean Peninsula from around A.D. to before the third century A.D., which is considered to be Daegu, Yeongcheon, Gyeongju, and Gimhae, which are the Nakdonggang River basin. It is believed that mirrors were produced in the leading small countries of Byeonhan and Jinhan in this area.Foreign exchanges were an important axis of the development of Samhan, and the Imitated Bronze Mirror, produced in Byeonjin and Jinhan from before the 3rd century AD, influenced the production patterns of each period in relation to China. The I period was the period when Saro-guk(斯盧國) grew into an early state in the 1st century, and the early Consecutive arcs design series and Concentric rings design series IA1∼IA4 and IIA type, which were re-established in Daegu and Yeongcheon areas, were first introduced. The II period is from the late 1st century to the early 2nd century, and appears in Byeonhan, which grew on the southern coast of Gyeongsangnam-do, replacing Saro-guk. The type of IIB and IIC in the Consecutive arcs design series, which made a new change under the influence of the Later Han-Mirror, is popular, and it is a creative work that combines the original elements of the old and old country in Gimhae. The III period is from the mid to late 2nd century, and amid the political turmoil in Northeast Asia, Imitated Bronze Mirror shows changes in patterns and production techniques. Although the IIB and IIC types still exist, they show the advanced characteristics of the newly created Samhan-style fire protection mirror. Later, as the Guya-guk(狗邪國) grew economically through international trade, the Later Han-Mirror, which marked status and economic wealth, was replaced by a new symbol, and the Imitated Bronze Mirror disappeared."
"Analyzing the contact problem of a functionally graded layer resting on an elastic half plane with theory of elasticity, finite element method and multilayer perceptron",2021,"['contact problem', 'functionally graded layer', 'theory of elasticity', 'finite element method', 'multilayer perceptron', 'quarter plane']",,"This paper presents a comparative study of analytical method, finite element method (FEM) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for analysis of a contact problem. The problem consists of a functionally graded (FG) layer resting on a half plane and pressed with distributed load from the top. Firstly, analytical solution of the problem is obtained by using theory of elasticity and integral transform techniques. The problem is reduced a system of integral equation in which the contact pressure are unknown functions. The numerical solution of the integral equation was carried out with Gauss-Jacobi integration formulation. Secondly, finite element model of the problem is constituted using ANSYS software and the two-dimensional analysis of the problem is carried out. The results show that contact areas and the contact stresses obtained from FEM provide boundary conditions of the problem as well as analytical results. Thirdly, the contact problem has been extended based on the MLP. The MLP with three-layer was used to calculate the contact distances. Material properties and loading states were created by giving examples of different values were used at the training and test stages of MLP. Program code was rewritten in C++. As a result, average deviation values such as 0.375 and 1.465 was obtained for FEM and MLP respectively. The contact areas and contact stresses obtained from FEM and MLP are very close to results obtained from analytical method. Finally, this study provides evidence that there is a good agreement between three methods and the stiffness parameters has an important effect on the contact stresses and contact areas."
Global and Local Damage Detection in Continuous Bridge Decks Using Instantaneous Amplitude Energy and Cross-correlation Function Methods,2021,"['Structural health monitoring', 'Signal processing', 'Damage detection', 'Damage localization', 'Instantaneous amplitude', 'Cross-correlation']",,"This paper attempts to detect damage in the length of continuous deck bridges by providing new methods based on acceleration responses and their Instantaneous Amplitudes (IAs). The DD in this paper has two steps: firstly, determining the vicinity of damage in global damage detection; secondly, determining the location of damage in local damage detection. Then by acceleration signals, the IA values of healthy and damaged structural responses extracted using Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT). Further, with the impression of the IA energy damage index (EDA), damage location is detected. Moreover, for the accurate evaluation of the proposed method, damage locations are determined using the cross-correlation damage index (CCDI). To assess the feasibility and reliability of the proposed methods, several analytical models of concrete bridges of one to three-spans, as well as experimental models of a simply supported steel beam, slab-on-girder composite bridge, and the UFC benchmark bridge are investigated. To consider noise pollution during data acquisition, a certain amount of noise is added to the response. The comparison of the obtained analytical results with the experimental ones showed that the proposed methods can determine the damage locations with appropriate accuracy for different damage scenarios. Also, the results of the CCDI index concluded to the acceptable exact results associated with a rapid estimation."

Thus, the new feminist literature in Taiwan plays an important role in the history of Taiwan's literary creation. In the late 1980s, Taiwan's socio-economic transformation took place, with Taipei showing a postmodern state of society, and the role of women in society changed accordingly. Women are no longer confined to raising children with their husbands at home, but they are beginning to enter society and work. In 1990, a collection of Zhu Tian's short stories, The End of the Century, was published, which contained 11 works, one of which bears the same name as the book. “Flamboyant at the End of the Century” was selected as one of the top 10 Chinese novels of the 20th century and won the 4th Newman Prize for Chinese Literature in the United States. The novel narrates the romance between Mia, the heroine's professional model, and her lover, Lao Duan. Chu Tien-wen wrote a modern version of a myth, an allegory, a story of two of the most typical professions in a metropolis in Taipei, and a delusional novel explaining the relationship between dress and body, appearance and substance, women and men.

Control of a Non-uniform Flexible Beam: Identification of First Two Modes,2021,"['Experimental modal analysis', 'flexible beam', 'input shaping control', 'modal parameter identification', 'non-uniform beam', 'vibration suppression.']",,"This paper presents an experimental study implementing the input shaping control of the first two modes of the vibration of a non-uniform flexible cantilever beam having a translating base. Examples of a moving cantilever beam appear in many industrial systems. Vibration suppression of the beam has important implications for improving the effectiveness of such systems. The equations of motion of the cantilever beam, including the moving base, are developed using the extended Hamilton principle. The partial differential equation representing the beam’s dynamics is then transformed into a finite-dimensional model using the Galerkin method. Accordingly, the modal parameter identification procedure is established based on experimental modal analysis. Under the estimated modal parameters, including the natural frequency and damping ratio, single- and two-mode input shaping controllers of three different types (zero vibration, zero vibration derivative, and zero vibration derivative-derivative) are designed for vibration suppression of the beam. Experimental results are discussed, reporting that the two-mode shaper’s vibration suppression was superior to the single-mode shaper. In contrast, the two-mode shaper’s settling time has slightly increased compared to that of the single-mode shaper."

To achieve the goal US Department of Education(DOE) adapted the turnaround technique using in the business field to overcome the severe situation shortly and rapidly. The 1,400 schools of 850,000students were granted from 2010-11 to 2012-13 school year. To get the grant the school should select one of 4 models such as the turnaround, the restart, the closure, and the transformation models based on the turnaround technique. The policy of SIGs was analyzed through the plan, the do, and the see steps. At the first step the plan was analyzed in terms of the necessity and the decision making. The necessity of SIGs was valid. As the lowest achievement students caused lots of social problems the government had tried these problems since 1965. In spite of lots of efforts the problem had been worse. Solving these problems was very important. Even though it was valid the decision making was not proper for educational situation. DOE did not consider the educational contingency seriously. At the second step the doing process was analyzed in terms of law, institutional functions, model, period, and role of teachers, students, and community. The law was well regulated and the institutions such as state education agency and local education agency functioned well. But models were not fit for education and period was too short. The teachers, students, and community’s role which were playing a major part of education were not considered thoroughly. At the third step the seeing process was analyzed based on the performance and continuity. The effectiveness of SIGs depended on the reporters: DOE reported effective, while Dragoset, et al.(2017) was not effective. The policy was not sustainable because of short period and grants limited. As the education needs long period, the educational policy should consider the educational perspective instead of using business technique. Cooperating with teachers, students, and community is major factors fulfilling educational policy based on the educational theory."
Characteristic analysis of new hybrid compensation topology for wireless charging circuits,2021,"['Wireless power transfer', 'Constant-current output', 'Constant-voltage output', 'Electric vehicle charging']",,"Wireless power transfer (WPT) has the advantages of flexibility, safety, and high reliability. Thus, it is widely used in portable electronic equipment, electric vehicles (EV), medical equipment, and other fields. The resonance compensation method of wireless charging directly affects the gain characteristics of the output current and voltage. As a result, this is one of the main research focuses of wireless power transmission technology. A new hybrid compensation topology circuit is proposed in this paper, which is based on the EV constant-current (CC) and constant-voltage (CV) charging mode. In this hybrid topology circuit, an equivalent loosely coupled transformer T model is established for the primary and secondary coils. Through an analysis of the circuit principle, it is concluded that the wireless power transmission circuit can realize CC and CV outputs under a dynamic load change. The output power efficiency characteristics of the serial/parallel (S/P) compensation and serial/serial (S/S) compensation circuits are analyzed. In addition, the mutual inductance parameters are optimized by an efficiency power product method to achieve the overall optimal parameter design in terms of the circuit output power and efficiency. A simulation model and an experimental prototype of the wireless power transmission circuit are established. The design process of the circuit parameters under a given target current and voltage is also presented. The simulation verifies the correctness of the constant current and constant voltage output of the S/P-S/S hybrid compensation circuit. The experimental platform verifies the CC output under the S/P compensation topology, and the CV output under the serial/serial (S/S) compensation topology."

However, how lactic acid fermentation of PS influences glucose and lipid metabolism remains unclear. The current study was undertaken to evaluate the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects of PS fermented with Lactobacillus brevis YM 1301 (YM 1301) in streptozotocin and high-fat diet-induced T2DM mice. Biochemical analysis revealed that supplementation with metformin, PS, or fermented Polygonatum sibiricum (FPS) lowered the fasting blood glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of diabetic mice. FPS showed relatively more potency to reduce the homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance and glycated hemoglobin than PS. Moreover, a high dosage of FPS protected against glucose intolerance and insulin resistance by increasing the ratio of phosphor-AKT/AKT. Histological examination and quantitative polymerase chain reaction results showed that dietary FPS ameliorated the lipid accumulation in liver and white adipose tissue (WAT) by inhibiting lipogenesis, enhancing lipolysis, and fatty acid oxidation. FPS exhibited greater efficacy than PS on improving the transcriptional expression of adipose triacylglyceride lipase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, and uncoupling protein 1. In addition, FPS exerted a striking anti-inflammatory effect by suppressing the expression of interleukin 6, interleukin 1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and transforming growth factor-β in WAT of diabetic C57BL/6 mice. Finally, FPS supplementation enhanced the activation of AMPK. In conclusion, these results suggest that the FPS may be more promising than PS as a potential therapeutic agent for diabetes and obesity."

Fluorescent Tagging of Polymer Particles with PBN for the Detection of Microplastics in Personal Care Goods,2021,"['Polymer Particle', 'Staining', 'Screening Method', 'Commercially Available Product']",,"Objectives : Plastic pollution has been aggravated due to the massive use of disposable products and single-use face masks since the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. There is growing interest regarding detection and identification of plastic pollution in daily life. The aim of this study is (1) to investigate suitability of a fluorescent labelling method for the detection of polymers, (2) to detect microplastics in personal care goods, and (3) to identify the detected plastic particles.Methods : In order to detect plastic particles in real samples, a 1-pyrenebutyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (PBN) fluorophore was used as a dye for staining plastic particles. First, the capability of PBN was evaluated by staining a model polymer of polyethylene (PE) particles, and its desorption and photobleaching was also investigated. Using the optimum staining condition, microplastics were detected in a laboratory-controlled sample and commercially available products, specifically in cleansers, scrubs, and toothpastes. Finally, the detected microplastics were identified using an attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR FT-IR) analysis.Results and discussion : The PE particles fluoresced blue light after being stained with PBN at a concentration of 100 ㎍/mL for 3-5 min without post treatments (e.g., fixation and drying), but the particles should be detected within 24 h due to the photobleaching of PBN. The desorption of PBN fluorophore occurred when the stained PE particles were washed with 25% acetone rather than rinse-off with deionized (DI) water. All of the tested personal care goods contained plastic particles and various sizes and shapes (e.g., spherical, rounded, and irregular shapes) of particles were found in different types and brands of products. The detected particles were identified as PE, polypropylene (PP), polycarbonate (PC), ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), polystyrene (PS), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) polymers.Conclusions : The PBN was shown to effectively stain polymer particles and it allowed visual identification of microplastics in personal care goods. Various types and sizes of polymers were included into the commercially available products as ingredients, indicating a primary source of plastic pollution in aquatic environment."

Design of a MEMS sensor array for dam subsidence monitoring based on dual-sensor cooperative measurements,2021,"['Dam monitoring system', 'MEMS sensor arrays', 'Cooperative measurement with dual-sensors', 'Subsidence monitoring', 'Platform to realize']",,"With the rapid development of the Chinese water project, the safety monitoring of dams is urgently needed. Many drawbacks exist in dams, such as high monitoring costs, a limited equipment service life, long-term monitoring difficulties. MEMS sensors have the advantages of low cost, high precision, easy installation, and simplicity, so they have broad application prospects in engineering measurements. This paper designs intelligent monitoring based on the collaborative measurement of dual MEMS sensors. The system first determines the endpoint coordinates of the sensor array by the coordinate transformation relationship in the monitoring system and then obtains the dam settlement according to the endpoint coordinates. Next, this paper proposes a dual-MEMS sensor collaborative measurement algorithm that builds a mathematical model of the dual-sensor measurement. The monitoring system realizes mutual compensation between sensor measurement data by calculating the motion constraint matrix between the two sensors. Compared with the single-sensor measurement, the dual-sensor measurement algorithm is more accurate and can improve the reliability of long-term monitoring data. Finally, the experimental results show that the dam subsidence monitoring system proposed in this paper fully meets the engineering monitoring accuracy needs, and the dual-sensor collaborative measurement system is more stable than the single-sensor monitoring system."

However, even when using easy-to-use finite element software tools, errors can occur during the setup of finite element simulations, and users should be warned about certain mistakes by automatic algorithms. To use the vast amount of available finite element simulations for a data-driven finite element support tool, in this paper, a methodology will be presented to transform different finite element simulations to unified matrices. The procedure is based on the projection of nodes onto a detector sphere, which is converted into a matrix in the next step. The generated matrices represent the simulation and can be described as the DNA of a finite element simulation. They can be used as an input for any machine learning model, such as convolutional neural networks. The essential steps of preprocessing the data and an application with a large dataset are part of this contribution. The trained network can then be used for an automatic plausibility check for new simulations, based on the previous simulation data from the past. This can result in a tool for automatic plausibility checks and can be the backbone for a feedback system for less experienced users."
A review on the application of means-end chain theory in tourism,2021,"['Key words:Means-end chain theory', 'Laddering technique', 'Consumer values', 'Tourist motivation']",,"Scholars investigating customer values and behavior in the field of tourism have used various measurement procedures. This study reviews the application of means-end chain (MEC) theory and its accompanying laddering technique in tourism and hospitality research. MEC theory provides a theoretical framework for scholars to understand consumer behavior. By reviewing 39 publications, this study aimed to comb previous reviews on MEC theory in the tourism industry via a more systematic and integrated review of this literature. We performed bibliometric analysis, which allowed us to establish study clusters, identify key research objects, distinguish interrelations, and excavate collaboration patterns. Content analysis was used to transform crucial results systematically and identify the importance of MEC theory in tourism research, the comprehensive application of multiple models and laddering techniques, and alternative approaches to grouping hierarchical value maps. The conclusion shows that tourism motivation is the most researched theme, and China and Chinese tourists are the most researched region and subjects. This study contributes theoretically and methodologically to the literature related to MEC theory. Theoretically, it bridges the gap of MEC theory used in tourism research and provides theoretical reference for the tourism industry. Methodologically, it also can lead respondents to think about their inner values in response to research questions. Moreover, it can be used alongside other research methods to contribute to more comprehensive and valuable knowledge about tourism."
Adaptive Distance Protection Scheme Setting in Presence of SVC Using Remote Terminal Unit,2021,['Remote Terminal Unit  · FACTS Devices  · Adaptive Protection  · Relay Setting  · Transmission lines'],,FACTS devices are presently used to improve the power transfer capability of a transmission line and voltage stability of a power system network. Shunt injected current (I sh ) by the Static Var Compensators (SVC) causes underreach or overreach of distance relay when not considered during relay calibration of protection system. This paper presents an adaptive relay setting procedure in the presence of a SVC connected at the midpoint of a transmission line. The remote terminal unit RTU is connected to the SVC terminal via a current transformer (CT) measures the injected shunt current when the SVC is the switch in or out of the network and transferred the measured value to the local station via fi ber optic. The PSCAD/ EMTDC software is used to model an adaptive relay that implements the conventional and adaptive relay system settings.The proposed scheme presents a hybrid distance protection system whose setting is based on the prevailing SVC switching conditions; the relay system was implemented using mho characteristics relay. The results obtained show that the proposed scheme has a high accurate setting

The Freundlich and pseudo-second-order models emerged as the best fit for the equilibrium and kinetic data, respectively.The rich oxygen-based surface functional groups entrenched on the ‘Manna_COOH’ sequel to its functionalization played a major role in making it a promising biosorbent for aqueous Co (II) uptake."
Effects of Human Capital and Innovation on Economic Growth in Selected ASEAN Countries: Evidence from Panel Regression Approach,2021,"['Human Capital', 'Innovation', 'Economic Growth', 'ASEAN', 'Panel Regression Approach']",,"Human capital and innovation capacities are essential elements and one of the sustainable approaches to driving economic growth. However, there is debate among scholars concerning these two factors in fostering economic growth. This study investigates the relationships between human capital and innovation capacity and economic growth in selected ASEAN countries, namely, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia. Economists widely discussed the interrelation of human capital and innovation. A large body of literature stated that human capital is an essential factor and engine of economic growth. Innovation has become key in transforming the economic development of developing countries. We analyze human capital (HC) and innovation capacity (INC) using static panel data analysis. The data analysis shows that the fixed-effect model is the best model in this study. Further, human capital (HC) has a significant positive relationship with economic growth. Meanwhile, innovation capacity has no significant relationship with economic growth. We also found that Malaysia’s coefficient of human capital and innovation capacity is higher and more efficient than in Thailand and Indonesia. In conclusion, human capital and innovation capacity are crucial elements for measuring economic growth. Skilled human capital contributes significantly to the economic growth and economic development of a nation."

Coarse to Fine 단계를 통한 TerraSAR-X Staring Mode 다중 관측각 영상 정합기법 비교 분석,2021,"['SAR', 'SAR registration', 'TerraSAR-X', 'Non-rigid', 'Optical flow']",,"With the recent increase in available high-resolution (< ~1 m) satellite SAR images, the demand for precise registration of SAR images is increasing in various fields including change detection. The registration between high-resolution SAR images acquired in different look angle is difficult due to speckle noise and geometric distortion caused by the characteristics of SAR images. In this study, registration is performed in two stages, coarse and fine, using the x-band SAR data imaged at staring spotlight mode of TerraSAR-X. For the coarse registration, a method combining the adaptive sampling method and SAR-SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) is applied, and three rigid methods (NCC: Normalized Cross Correlation, Phase Congruency-NCC, MI: Mutual Information) and one non-rigid (Gefolki: Geoscience extended Flow Optical Flow Lucas-Kanade Iterative), for the fine registration stage, was performed for performance comparison. The results were compared by using RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and FSIM (Feature Similarity) index, and all rigid models showed poor results in all image combinations. It is confirmed that the rigid models have a large registration error in the rugged terrain area. As a result of applying the Gefolki algorithm, it was confirmed that the RMSE of Gefolki showed the best result as a 1~3 pixels, and the FSIM index also obtained a higher value than 0.02~0.03 compared to other rigid methods. It was confirmed that the mis-registration due to terrain effect could be sufficiently reduced by the Gefolki algorithm."

According to the analysis of textbooks, simple game transformation and making were the mainstays in the state of lack of understanding of creativity education. Creativity education in physical education in the future should be a systematic form that includes a creative process."
Commutability Assessment of Candidate External Quality Assessment Materials for Aminotransferase Activity Measurements Based on Different Approaches in China,2021,"['Alanine aminotransferase', 'Aspartate aminotransferase', 'Commutability', 'External quality assessment materials']",,"Background: Using commutable external quality assessment (EQA) materials is important for monitoring successful harmonization efforts. We assessed the commutability of four human serum pool (HSP) preparations to identify candidate EQA materials for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity measurement.Methods: One set each of 85 clinical samples (CSs) was collected for ALT and AST activity measurement. The 15 candidate EQA materials included four types of HSP preparations (A to D): materials A, C, and D contained human original recombinant (HOR) aminotransferases; materials B was mixed leftover samples. The CSs and 15 candidate EQA materials were analyzed using seven routine assays, and the ln-transformed results were analyzed in 21 assay pairs. Commutability was assessed using Deming regression, with a 95% prediction interval (CLSI approach) and the difference in bias with an error component model (International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine [IFCC] approach).Results: For ALT, all materials were commutable for 14–21 assay pairs according to the CLSI and IFCC approaches. For AST, B01-03 showed commutability for 14-21 assay pairs, and C01-03 and D01-03 showed commutability for no less than 10 assay pairs according to the two approaches. A01-06 were commutable for 9-16 assay pairs according to the CLSI approach, but for 6-9 assay pairs according to the IFCC approach.Conclusions: Mixed leftover samples showed desirable commutability characteristics as candidate EQA materials for routine aminotransferase activity measurements. Human serum bases supplemented with HOR were commutable for most routine ALT activity measurements."
RGB 항공 영상을 이용한 하천 합류부 전단층 추출법,2021,[],,"River confluence is often characterized by shear layer and the associated strong mixing. In natural rivers, the main channel and its tributary can be separated by the shear layer using contrasting colors. The shear layer can be easily observed using aerial images from satellite or unmanned aerial vehicles. This study proposes a low-cost identification method extracting geographic features of the shear layer using RGB aerial image. The method consists of three stages. At first, in order to identify the shear layer, it performs image segmentation using a Gaussian mixture model and extracts the water bodies of the main channel and tributary. Next, the self-organizing map simplifies the flow line of the water bodies into the 1-dimensional curve grid. After that, the curvilinear coordinate transformation is performed using the water body pixels and the curve grid. As a result, the shear layer identification method was successfully applied to the confluence between Nakdong River and Nam River to extract geometric shear layer features (confluence angle, upstream- and downstream- channel widths, shear layer length, maximum shear layer thickness)."
Residual bearing capacity of steel-concrete composite beams under fatigue loading,2021,"['steel-concrete composite beam', 'fatigue damage', 'residual bearing capacity', 'stud connector', 'experimental test']",,"This study was conducted to investigate the residual bearing capacity of steel-concrete composite beams under highcycle fatigue loading through experiments and theoretical analysis. Six test beams with stud connectors were designed and fabricated for static, complete fatigue, and partial fatigue tests. The failure modes and the degradation of several mechanical performance indicators of the composite beams under high-cycle fatigue loading were analyzed. A calculation method for the residual bearing capacity of the composite beams after certain quantities of cyclic loading cycles was established by introducing nonlinear fatigue damage models for concrete, steel beam, and shear connectors beginning with the material residual strength attenuation process. The results show that the failure mode of the composite beams under the given fatigue load appears to be primarily affected by the number of cycles. As the number of fatigue loadings increases, the failure mode transforms from midspan concrete crushing to stud cutting. The bearing capacity of a 3.0-m span composite beam after two million fatigue cycles is degraded by 30.7% due to premature failure of the stud. The calculated values of the residual bearing capacity method of the composite beam established in this paper agree well with the test values, which indicates that the model is feasibly applicable."

We will first focus on the theories which relate catastrophes and language and we will take a particular interest in the analysis of the linguistic network. This theoretical basis will allow us to approach the way in which the French language to integrate or reject, transform and then shape a series of terms conjunctive to COVID-19. Eleven new uses will then be selected - according to criteria of frequency of use, disciplinary convergence, association with other neologisms and cultural relevance - then analyzed. The results of our research will show that it is possible to teach these new words to French language learners. To this end, the last part of our study will propose a course model structured around five stages: identification of new uses, polysemy of terms, association of ideas, words in networks and narration."

Radioactive cesium and radioactive iodine, in particular, are known to be the main causes of environmental pollution. This study aimed to develop a composite adsorbent that can remove Cs<sup>+</sup> and I<sup>-</sup> from a waterbody simultaneously. Prussian blue (PB) and organoclay are known to be effective in adsorbing cesium and iodide, respectively. Therefore, an organoclay-PB in alginate (OPAL) bead with layer-by-layer synthesis was developed. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and thermogravimetric (TG) analyses were used to determine if organoclay and PB were synthesized in the OPAL bead. According to the isothermal adsorption experimental results, the maximum adsorption capacity of Cs<sup>+</sup> and I<sup>-</sup> obtained using the Langmuir isotherm model was 26.4 and 3.39 mg/g, respectively. The adsorption rate of Cs<sup>+</sup> on the OPAL bead was found to be fast in a dual solute adsorption system. The adsorption capacity of the single and dual solute adsorption systems for Cs<sup>+</sup> ions increased rapidly up to 1 h, and the adsorption equilibrium was attained 3 h later. The dual solute adsorption system had a higher adsorption rate for I- ions. This demonstrates that the developed composite adsorbent can be used to remove Cs<sup>+</sup> and I<sup>-</sup> from water simultaneously."

This approach leads us to recognize the continuance of the method of linguistic study by comparing between Ibn Khaldūn's views of language which were totally developed to his age and some modern linguists' theories, especially the generative transformational theory.In order to accomplish the aim, this paper will, in the second chapter, deal with Ibn Khaldūn's definition of language and compare it with some modern linguists’ definition. In the third chapter, the definition of al-malakah al-lisānīyah will be made with the prescription of its conditions and preconditions. Likewise, the comparison between al-malakah al-lisānīyah and linguistic competence by Chomsky will be made to prove the theoretical relations between them through the language acquisition. This will give us a clear answer to the question we might ask “Why compare al-malakah al-lisānīyah with Chomsky's work rather than alternative models such as those developed by Brame, Bresnan, Gazdar and others?”In the last part, this paper will present the method of Ibn Khaldūn's linguistic study - the descriptive and explanatory method, stressing the necessity of recognizing that his linguistic method was influenced by the historical method."

In particular, the increase in product diversity, complexity and short lead times due to the increase in demand for high-quality, personalized products are leading the change from the existing mass production method to the personalized production method. In order to respond to the market requirements in this hyper-competitive era, the transition to a smart manufacturing production system is being promoted. As a key element of the 4th industry, the smart factory is an important concept of high value-added industrial innovation and is a key technology of future manufacturing competitiveness. However, few studies have been explored empirically in this perspective.  Therefore, the purpose of this study is to verify the effect of technological factors(sensor network technology, platform technology, manufacturing information system, and intelligent automation) on operational performance, and the mediating effect of CEO leadership and IT expert. In order to examine the hypothesis of this study, a survey was conducted on semiconductor companies as research subjects. Using valid 115 samples, SPSS 23.0 and SmartPLS 3.0 were used as research methods for hypothesis test.   The results of this study showed that sensor network technology, platform technology, manufacturing information system, and intelligent automation as technological factor all had a significant positive (+) effect on operational performance. In addition, it was confirmed that CEO leadership and IT expert had a mediating effect in the relationship between the technological factors and operational performance. The IT expert showed a partial mediating effect between sensor network technology and operational performance, and also between platform technology and operational performance. The CEO leadership showed a partial mediating effect between the platform technology and operational performance, and also manufacturing information system and operational performance. In particular, it was confirmed that CEO leadership had a full mediating effect between intelligent automation and operational performance.  Since empirical studies on the success factors and operational performance of smart factory introduction are very insignificant, the significance of this study is to empirically derive the effect of smart factory establishment on operational performance for semiconductor manufacturing companies. Although many companies agree on the need of smart factory adoption, they are unable to actively adopt it due to various restrictions including excessive investment costs. However, through the results of this study, it is judged that it can be a reference for decision-making for establishment of strategic and efficient manufacturing operations for companies considering smart factory adoption."

We chose different word embedding types (Word2Vec, Word Mover‘s Distance (WMD), Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)) and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), a linguistic model for comparing semantic differences between two sentences based on semantic representation. Scoring systems should not only satisfy the requirements of complicated scoring rubrics but also meet the conditions of a language proficiency test. Our results show that BERT outperforms three competitive models in predicting accurate scoring levels and also shows the characteristics of the criterion reference which could theoretically express the standards of a language proficiency test."

Therefore, a simulator that can be applied in the design stage of a water treatment facility has no choice but to be built as a numerical analysis model of a deductive technique. In this study, we had conducted basic research on governing equations, inter-process data-flow, and simulator algorithms for the development of simulators. Lastly, this study will contribute to design engineering tool development research in the future by establishing the water treatment theory so that it can be programmed in a virtual world and suggesting a method for digital transformation of the water treatment process."
De la Disrupción a la Nueva Constitución: El Proceso Chileno en el Ciclo de Crisis 2011 A 2019,2021,"['Chile', 'Protests', 'Constitution', 'Transition', 'Neoliberalism', 'Protestas', 'Constitucion', 'Transicion', 'Neoliberalismo']",,"The process of forming a constituent assembly which started in 2019 is a democratic response to the authoritarian matrix of the 1980 Constitution; hence, the political understanding of both processes of construction of the fundamental legal framework must be found in the previous moment that inaugurated a new structuring of power in society, and which allows the emergence of an associated constituent power. In 1980 the previous restructuring of power came from the coup. In 2019 the previous restructuring of power came from the cycle of mobilizations from 2011 to 2019, which culminated in the social explosion of October 2019 and which forced the post-dictatorship elite to seek a way out of the crisis through a constitutional change. In this context, the dictatorial Constitution was the institutional translation of the authoritarian regime and the monetarist economic model, and it was a synthesis of the conservative Hispanic and Catholic legal tradition. The process of creating a new constituent assembly is a response to the exclusions of the Chilean political transition, and it is mainly the translation of the anti-neoliberal social movements in the form of a fundamental legal framework. What will be its big challenge? It will be to respond to discomfort more than to criticism; thus, transforming the malaise into a project of society is the main hope and the greatest difficulty."
Utilization of black mustard husk ash for adsorption of fluoride from water,2021,"['Adsorption', 'Batch Study', 'Fluoride Removal', 'pH', 'Black Mustard Husk']",,"Fluoride removal systems have been established to curb the health hazards from fluoride. However, these techniques are not feasible in rural communities. Therefore, use of agricultural wastes as adsorbing material for fluoride removal can be fruitful to rural areas. A study of the influence of constraints like pH, adsorbent dosage, contact period and stirring rate on efficiency of fluoride removal was conducted using ash obtained from black mustard husk as an adsorptive material. Batch study was carried out to study the efficiency of the adsorbent for defluoridation.Removal efficiency of up to 84 percent was observed for the fluoride uptake using black mustard husk fly ash (BMHFA).Adsorbent dosage of 2 g, pH value of 2, contact time of 150 min and stirring rate of 200 rpm were found to be the optimum process parameter values. Adsorption models like Freundlich, Temkin and Langmuir models were used to validate the results. Langmuir model was seen best fitting with the results having an R2 value equal to 0.96 and indicating a homogeneous monolayer surface assimilation. Pseudo-first-order kinetics, pseudo-second-order kinetic modelling and intra-particle diffusion were studied. The kinetic models showed the prominent influence of physisorption in the adsorption process. A thermodynamic study of the adsorption phenomenon was conducted and it was found that the nature of sorption process was spontaneous and endothermic. The adsorbent was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The adsorbent was found to be efficient in fluoride sorption when tested on real water samples. Regeneration study showed good reusability of the spent adsorbent. This study provides a good prospective and stimulating work for the researchers working in this field."
Fuzzy Mediation Analysis for KOSPI-Related Variables,2021,"['Fuzzy numbers', 'Fuzzy data', 'KOSPI', 'Fuzzy mediation analysis']",,"Stock prices and bond interest rates are inversely related. The current account plays the most important role in the rise of composite stock index. When the trade surplus increases, stock prices rise sharply. Conversely, when the exchange rate and government bond interest rates increase, the composite stock index decreases. The stock index is influenced by several economic variables, politics, the economy, and investment sentiment. In real situations, such financial variables are mostly fuzzy variables. For example, the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) is recorded based on the closing price. However, the daily KOSPI has many values, such as the open price, low price, and high price; therefore, if only the closing price is used for analysis, only partial information is. To analyze the relationship between KOSPI-related variables, the KOSPI, stock deposits, government bond interest rates, and foreign security investment data are applied. We investigated the mediated relation of variables, known as mediation analysis. In particular, we implemented fuzzy mediation analysis owing to the ambiguity of given data. In the data analysis, we proposed several fuzzy mediation models using fuzzy transformed data."
Aero-engine Gas Path Performance Degradation Assessment Based on a Multi-objective Optimized Discrete Feddback Network,2021,"['Discrete feedback network', 'gas path performance assessment', 'inertia weight', 'multi-source state parameters', 'particle swarm optimization.']",,"In order to solve the problem of neural network algorithm for aero-engine’s gas path performance evaluation under high-dimensional evaluation index with non-equal weights, the trend analysis method and fault fingerprints are used to mine engine’s gas path performance characteristic parameters. A comprehensive weighting method based on game theory is proposed to optimize the weight value of each gas path performance characteristic parameter. A discrete feedback neural network with single-layer and binary output is established. The original gas path performance evaluation index is equivalently expanded according to the weight ratio, and the gas path state evaluation indexes with different weights are mapped into higher-dimensional equivalent evaluation indexes with equal weights. The network attractor is designed according to the engine gas path performance evaluation levels, and the design of discrete feedback neural network weights is transformed into multi-objective programming problem, and a particle swarm optimization algorithm with adaptive inertia weight is used to improve the efficiency and global search ability of particle swarm optimization. The experimental results shows that the proposed model and algorithm can provide a scientific and reasonable machine learning method for the evaluation of high-dimensional evaluation index with non-equal weights."

The term “Aids to Navigation” means an aid to navigation prescribed by Ordinance of the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries which shows navigating ships the position and direction of the ships, position of obstacles, etc. through lights, shapes, colors, sound, radio waves, etc. Also now the use of Aids to Navigation is transforming into a means of identifying and recording the marine weather environment by mounting various sensors and cameras. However, Aids to Navigation are mainly lost due to collisions with ships, and in particular, safety accidents occur because of poor observation visibility due to sea fog. The inflow of sea fog poses risks to ports and sea transportation, and it is not easy to predict sea fog because of the large difference in the possibility of occurrence depending on time and region. In addition, it is difficult to manage individually due to the features of Aids to Navigation distributed throughout the sea. To solve this problem, this paper aims to identify the marine weather environment by estimating sea fog level approximately with images taken by cameras mounted on Aids to Navigation and to resolve safety accidents caused by weather. Instead of optical and temperature sensors that are difficult to install and expensive to measure sea fog level, sea fog level is measured through the use of general images of cameras mounted on Aids to Navigation. Furthermore, as a prior study for real-time sea fog level estimation in various seas, the sea fog level criteria are presented using the Haze Model and Dark Channel Prior. A specific threshold value is set in the image through Dark Channel Prior(DCP), and based on this, the number of pixels without sea fog is found in the entire image to estimate the sea fog level. Experimental results demonstrate the possibility of estimating the sea fog level using synthetic haze image dataset and real haze image dataset."

Thesecondary cracking reaction was dominant at high-residue conversion (>60 wt%) without the catalystbut it was suppressed by the catalyst. Moreover, the conversion of asphaltenes at high-residue conversionswas found to be dependent on the catalyst concentration. At low catalyst concentrations(0–100 ppm), asphaltenes were converted to light products at low-residue conversions and to coke athigh-residue conversions. At high catalyst concentrations (100–500 ppm), asphaltenes were mainly convertedto light products even at high conversions. Based on the experimental results, equations for theonset of coke formation with respect to the catalyst concentration were proposed. The higher the catalystconcentration, the longer was the coke induction period. A kinetic model was also proposed, and theexperimental data could be predicted well using the same. The transformation of residue to coke wasdominant in the non-catalytic hydrocracking and the coke formation rate significantly decreased asthe catalyst concentration increased."

This can be used for improving service quality or marketing. Until now, most natural language processing studies have attempted to analyze emotions divided into positive, negative and neutral. However, in this work, specific negative reasons are extracted and classified. The dataset is a standard dataset from kaggle that uses tweet data for U.S. airline services. Tweets categorized as negative are labeled with 10 categories of negative reasons. The dataset was divided into train, validation, and test 8:1:1. The learning and classification process was largely divided into two stages. The first is to convert words and sentences into vector values. It is compared and analyzed using Doc2Vec and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) models for embedding and vectorization. The second is to learn and classify sentences transformed into vectors by matching them with 10 negative reason classes. During this learning process, I converted the negative reason into a sentence and attached it to the back of the original text and made new data.I then used BERT's Next Sentence Prediction technique to allow further learning to be performed. This method was able to improve classification accuracy. For each dataset and classification method, metrics were computed, visualized, and compared."

Korea under American occupation from 1945 to 1948 marks the departure from the Japanese totalitarian rule. But this occupation period brought back to Korean cinema the system of control similar to the late-colonial wartime mobilization. The state control of film production faculties, the utility of cinema for war operation, and the overall underdevelopment of film production continued. Concurrently, the film industry witnessed the rise of a group of film technicians indispensable for producing newsreels and documentaries. They also shared a strong sense of bond and historical experiences. A significant change occurred as the Korean film industry underwent a structural transformation after the Korean War. From the late 1950s onward, the various types of assistance and aid from the US into Korea triggered a series of seismic changes in the Korean film industry. They include the provision of filmmaking infrastructure and facilities and film production resources. These changes, in turn, facilitated the steady production of commercial narrative films, specialization, professionalization, and division of filmmaking techniques, as well as the rise of American film standards and their application in Korean filmmaking practice. Most of all, they brought the generational change, which also paralleled the historical shift from the postwar state of emergency to the prolonged condition of the Cold War contention. In this context, the accusation brought on by Yi Pil-u and his cohorts against the Yi Hyongpyo marks a historical significance. It ties to the issues of the generational change of film technicians. It also relates to the authoritarian politics where rumors on the pro-communist collaboration functioned as a source of the Cold War cultural mobilization. In short, the controversies of pro-communist collaboration serve as the marker that illustrates the historical change in the Korean film industry: from the colonial model of film practice to the new Cold War cultural politics and its practice. This paper aspires to illuminate the advent of the Cold War cinema production through specific cases of the pro-communist collaboration."

Contrasting with traditional mobile cloud computing, multi-access edge computing includes a base station cooperative cache layer and user cooperative cache layer. Selecting the most appropriate cache content according to actual needs and determining the most appropriate location to optimize the cache performance have emerged as serious issues in multi-access edge computing that must be solved urgently. For this reason, a cache placement algorithm based on comprehensive utility in big data multi-access edge computing (CPBCU) is proposed in this work. Firstly, the cache value generated by cache placement is calculated using the cache capacity, data popularity, and node replacement rate. Secondly, the cache placement problem is then modeled according to the cache value, data object acquisition, and replacement cost. The cache placement model is then transformed into a combinatorial optimization problem and the cache objects are placed on the appropriate data nodes using tabu search algorithm. Finally, to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm, a multi-access edge computing experimental environment is built. Experimental results show that CPBCU provides a significant improvement in cache service rate, data response time, and replacement number compared with other cache placement algorithms."

Due to complex scene analysis, recognition of multiple objects and the relation between the objects remain as a challenging part of the research. In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach for the scene understanding that integrates multiple objects detection/segmentation and scene labeling using Geometric features, Histogram of oriented gradient and scale invariant feature transform descriptors. The complete procedure of the purposed model includes resizing and noise removing of images from the dataset, multiple object segmentation and detection, feature extraction and multiple object recognition using multi-layer kernel sliding perceptron.After that, scene recognition is achieved by using multi-class logistic regression. Finally, two datasets such as MSRC and UIUC sports are used for the experimental evaluation of our proposed method. Our purposed method accurately handles the complex objects physical exclusion and objects occlusion. Therefore, it outperforms in term of accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art approaches."

Using Mona Baker’s Narrative Theory and Framing Concept and Kathryn Batchelor’s Paratext Concept as the theoretical basis, this study explores the representation of Satan in the source text and analyzes how its aspects were reframed in the South and North Korean translations’ paratext and main body. It specifically reviews the paratext’s preface and the commentary on the work, and it analyzes Satan’s appearance, action, and speech in the main body. The analysis shows that reframing took place mainly through selective appropriation and labelling during the translation process. In the paratext, the South Korean translation frames Paradise Lost as a Christian poem. The North Korean translation however transforms the source text into a radical political poem and reframes it as a communist narrative. Whereas the South Korean translation tends to weaken the positive narrative of Satan, the North Korean translation strengthens the positive narrative of Satan and relates it to the North Korean political narrative. The transformed Satan in the North Korean translation shares similarities with the role model of an autonomous communist common in the North Korean literature."

The term digital implies features such as homeostasis, transformability, combinability, reproducibility, and convenience of storage. One device that produces a combination of these digital characteristics is a 3D printer, but its industrial use is limited due to low productivity and limitations with materials and physical characteristics. In particular, improvements are required to use 3D printers, such as better user accessibility owing to expertise and skills in modeling software and printers. Complementing this fact is the 3D pen, which is excellent in portability and ease of use, but has a limitation in that it cannot be digitized. Therefore, in order to secure a digitalization capability and ease of use, and to secure the safety of printing materials that pose controversial hazards during the printing process, research problems and alternatives have been derived by combining food, and digitization was demonstrated with a newly developed 3D pen. In order to digitize the 3D pen, a sensor in a structured device detects the motion of an analog 3D pen, and this motion is converted into 3D data (X-Y-Z coordinate values) through a spatial analysis algorithm. To prove this method, the similarity was confirmed by visualization using MeshLab version 1.3.4. It is expected that this food pen can be used in youth education and senior healthcare programs in the future."

The key elements of the digital economy are online platforms and data. Compared to the traditional economic system, the online platform reduces search and transaction costs, and alleviates the temporal and spatial constraints of transactions. As a result, not only new services but traditional business models that existed only offline are rapidly changing to online platforms. However, since online platforms have characteristics such as a positive cross-network effect, and economies of scale and scope, user tipping into specific platforms and winner-take-all phenomena occur. Also it is difficult to recover and strengthen market competition compared to traditional offline markets. Nevertheless, since it becomes more complex and difficult to define the relevant market for online multi-sided platforms, to decide whether a platform has market power or not, and to evaluate anti-competitive effects because of platforms’ multi-sidedness and ecosystemization, it is becoming difficult or impossible to regulate online platforms with the traditional concept of market power. Accordingly, this paper examines various concepts of market power or market status to help identify the proper regulation of online platforms and to set the criteria for the concepts of market power. Based on this, the paper draws some implications for the proper oversight of online platforms."

Along with the well-recognized expected benefits of alternative energy sources, considerable shortcomings including deforestation, massive generation costs, and unstable power supplies have been identified. The public has become aware of the potential negative effects as well. Accordingly, the expansion of new and renewable energy facilities has encountered a new challenge to improve the public awareness. This study explores factors affecting people’s acceptance of new and renewable energy, analyzing the survey data collected from 790 laypeople in Korea. We examine the direct effects of citizen participation, policy public relations (PR), and transparency on public acceptance and the mediating effects of the public’s trust in a government agency in charge of implementing the new energy projects. Our analysis using structural equation modeling finds the following. First, trust is positively associated with public acceptance. Second, policy PR and transparency enhance trust that, in turn, improve public acceptance. Third, contrary to our expectations, people display lower acceptance as they engage more in the policy-making process and have more transparent information. Based on our findings, we make policy suggestions to secure public acceptance of new renewable energy."

The BNC64 corpus is composed of 64 files, which are taken from the spoken part of the BNC. The corpus contains 32 files for male speakers and 32 files for female speakers that represent the characteristics of male vs. female differences. The study analyzed all 64 files using sentiment analysis and tried to discover the differences. It is known that there are roughly three types of approach to sentiment analysis: dictionary-based analysis, machine-learning-based analysis, and deep-learning-based analysis. This study takes the first and third kind of analyses. In the dictionary-based analysis, the researchers calculate the sentiment score (SS), sentiment word ratio (SR), and positive word ratio (PR). In the deep-learning analysis, the researchers take two different sorts of analyses: the GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) and the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). Through the analyses, the study finds that (i) there is no significant differences in SS and SR between men and women, (ii) women usually use more positive words than men, and the differences are statistically significant, and (iii) the deep-learning-based analysis is much superior to modelling the gender differences in the sentiment analysis."

The common mode voltage (CMV) is one of the electrical hazards that is assumed to be a cause of those fire accidents. Several cases of CMV that violate the allowable insulation level of a battery section are being reported in actual ESS operation sites with △-Y winding connections. Thus, this paper evaluates the characteristics of CMV. An ESS site was modeled with an AC grid, PCS, and battery sections using PSCAD/EMTDC software. As a result of a simulation based on the proposed model, it was confirmed that characteristics of CMV vary significantly and are similar to actual measurements, depending on the grounding method of the internal transformer for PCS. The insulation level of the battery section may be severely degraded as the value of CMV exceeds the rated voltage in case of a grounding connection. It was found that the value of CMV dramatically declines when the internal transformer for PCS is operated as non-grounding connection, so it meets the standard insulation level."

From the biblical point of view, Israel is not more in number than any other people. Its existence is very small. Only through YHWH’s love is it selected. The purpose of the divine selection lays on the observation of the Torah which in the covenant contract on Mount Sinai YHWH has promulgated for Israel. With regard to the nations, the people claimed to dwell in the land securely, without the threat of enemies’ attacks (Lev 25:15ff.). This concept plays an important role in relationship with the nations. I have found multi-layered conceptions. First, Israel-centric: these see the nations negatively. Second, in a viewpoint that is positive toward the nations, they shall come to Mount Zion as pilgrims in order to learn the Torah of YHWH. Third, nations-centric: the scattered Israelites among the nations enlightening the nations with instruction and bringing light into the nations. In this process Israel itself becomes the light for the peoples. Compared to the above concepts, the last model is transcendent. It is so-called “the blessed nations of all.” All the nations that had oppressed Israel in the past become recipients of blessing. This idea foreshadows the Pauline Gospel. In sum, the fundamental thought that lays in the background of all these concepts is that the fates of the nations depend on their treatment of the elected people. The status of Israel would be never abolished (Rom 11:12, 18). Its existence remains a revelation of God in human history. In the coming future of humankind the values of the Torah shall be democratized among all the nations. So they shall be transformed into a new era."

Though a few universities are currently conducting educational programs to train school consultants, these have been noted for problems in the content of the educational programs and in their methodological aspects. Launched from the premise that educational programs for training school consultants are of great importance, the present research focuses on two areas which are currently pointed out as problems in the related educational programs, and addresses these problems by presenting alternative methods. Accordingly, for the purpose of creating an educational program for training school consultants which is suited to the circumstances of the ‘school,’ the research identifies what the components of the programs contents should be, proceeding through the stages of objective analysis, work responsibility analysis, and demand analysis. From this three types of broad topics were derived, including change management, self-leadership, and logical cognitive ability. Also, in terms of methodology, the teaching and learning model known as PBL was selected as a methodology capable of enhancing actual applicability and practical feasibility to conceptualize a ‘PBL Based Educational Program for Training School Consultants.’ The present research was limited to the stage of conducting a formative evaluation for the proposed program, there remains an urgent need for follow-up studies to apply the proposed design of the educational program for school consultant training to actual situations and thereby confirm the outcome. However, due to the rapid dissemination of the perception of the importance of such programs in the present time, the demand for educational programs to train school consultants is imperative. Hence the significance of this present research consists of having conducted the foundational research taking the first step of conducting a clear analysis of the characteristics and objectives of such educational program and illuminating the ‘content composition’ reflecting such identified features, as well as presenting a proposal for the design of the educational program which will properly implement these findings."

The reason for the leakage current from the PCS section is a voltage change by IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor) switching and stray capacitance between the IGBT and heatsink. The leakage current caused by the grid unbalanced current flows to the ESS through the neutral line of grid-connected transformer for the ESS with a three limb iron type of Yg-wire connection. This paper proposes a mechanism for the occurrence of leakage current caused by stray capacitance, which is calculated using the heatsink formula, from the aspect of the PCS section and grid unbalance current. Based on the proposed mechanisms, this study presents the modeling of the leakage current occurrence using PSCAD/EMTDC S/W and evaluates the characteristics of leakage currents from the PCS section and grid unbalanced current. From the simulation result, the leakage current has a large influence on the battery side by confirming that the leakage current from the PCS is increased from 7[mA] to 34[mA], and the leakage current from an unbalanced load to battery housing is increased from 3.96[mA] to 10.76[mA] according to the resistance of the housings and the magnitude of the ground resistance."

Methods The main search keywords related to “global citizenship education” were selected to analyze the characteristics of research trends in GCED studies in the 21st century, and it narrowed down to SSCI and Scopus level articles which met the predetermined criteria for this study. For the systematic literature review, text mining analysis and keyword network analysis were chosen in the four-step processing model for this study. Results First, from the perspective of categorizing global citizenship by Oxley & Morris (2013), global citizenship education (GCED) in the 21st century was discussed mainly on policy, cultural, and critical issues. And over the past 20 years, global issues of global citizenship education have changed as of the time when the UN s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) were announced in 2015. From the isues of ‘higher education’, ‘internationalization’ and ‘global competence’, which were mainly dealt with in previous studies on global citizenship education, new issues such as ‘sustainability’ and ‘transformation’, and ‘human rights’ and ‘environment’ have been diverse in recent years. Conclusions Based on the research results, the global agenda and the relationship between global citizenship education were expected to predict future trends in global citizenship education, and the expansion of the global citizenship education discussion on moral and environmental issues was proposed."

The concept of Holistic Missions and BAM, which was gradually developed through the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Lausanne Congresses and the 2004 Pattaya Forum, has been actively accepted by the Korean church and missions starting from the Shanghai Korean Business Forum in 2007. It gave the theoretical foundation for BAM missionary mobilization, education-training, missionary commission, and field support.This paper studies the continuity between the Holistic Mission of the Lausanne Movement and the actual cases of Korean BAM companies in mission fields. In order to identify the continuity, the study identifies the core concept of the Holistic Mission contained in the official documents of the Lausanne Movement, checks the development process of the BAM theory, and examines how the theory triggered by the Lausanne Movement has been practically applied to the Korean BAM ministries in recent years. Three CEOs or stakeholders who have served BAM company in mission fields participated in in-depth interviews, and shared their own cases in each country.The result of the in-depth interview demonstrates that Holistic Mission as a theory and BAM companies' stories as actual cases are consistent, and derives the following four common characteristics of BAM companies: 1) sustainable and for-profit business, 2) pursuit of holistic transformation, 3) living life as a mission through everyday process, and 4) creating tangible/ intangible missional impact. The four factors above have been rarely focused in previous BAM case studies. Some indicators, such as business model, corporate growth stage, and sustainability, have been focused on rather than BAM's own background and characteristics derived from the Holistic Mission.In this regard, this researcher expects that the above four characteristics will be applied as a meaningful BAM analysis framework and performance indicator in upcoming BAM case studies. Furthermore, considering that the three BAM companies in this study have backgrounds in the Creative Access Nation, Transition Country, and African country experiencing PTSD due to the civil war, this study is extensible to the issue of North Korean missions and BAM. Given that the number of countries with access restrictions are increasing recently, the BAM case studies are expected to be of great help to future world missions among global mission fields."

Financial ratios contain key accounting numbers which reflect firm fundamentals and are useful for valuation or risk analysis such as enterprise credit evaluation and default prediction. The distribution of financial data tends to be extremely heavy-tailed, and PER and PBR show exceedingly high level of kurtosis and their extreme cases often contain significant information on financial risk. In this respect, Extreme Value Theory is required to fit its right tail more precisely. I introduce not only GPD but exGPD.

For comparative literary analysis, this paper referred to Franco Moretti’s study of Bildungsroman and Christopher Parkes’ study of British children’s literature. For Bang Jeonghwan, “children” and “juvenile” were emergent beings sharing the same goal: The modern project. However, to Bang Jeonghwan, children were treated as “anti-modern impulses” (romance), whereas juveniles were treated as “modern representations”(reality). The two seem to be the opposite. This paper attempts to approach the meaning of growth and modernity by understanding the gap between Bang Jeonghwan’s ‘children’ and ‘juvenile.’  In appearance, ‘children’ and ‘juvenile’ seem to be contradictory. This was similarly found in British romantic literature, with children as the protagonists. Parkes read the character of children at the time as “the living embodiment of the spirit of capitalism.” This paper transforms and applies it as ‘the living embodiment of the spirit of modernism.’ Bang Jeonghwan’s ‘children’ and ‘juvenile’ are connected like both sides of a coin. The figures of children in his fairy tales seem far from modernism, but the distance between children and modernism does not suggest that their relationship is the opposite. Because the distance between them is temporary. Children are temporarily separated from reality in order to grow into beings more consistent with the “modern representation.” As a result of analyzing the text, the children’s enjoyment in Bang Jeonghwan’s fairy tales occurred as long as they have embodied the sense of modernity. Therefore, children here can be considered the backside of ‘the spirit of modernism’ and kind of preliminary stage rather than ‘anti-modern impulses.’  Children who have internalized modernity must grow into juveniles and take on the task of the modern project in earnest and intervene in reality. However, due to the colonial condition, those who grew up from children to juveniles could not get the same narrative. As a result, in Bang Jeonghwan’s juvenile novel, the juvenile appears as an already mature being, rather than reaching maturity through a series of processes. His juvenile novels repeat the narrative in which the already mature juvenile""s nature is discovered and recognized by the adult character around him. It did not correspond to the model of Western Bildungsroman, which promoted harmony between the “inner law”(self) and the “external law”(socialization). This paper regards it as a result of the difference in the conditions of the colonization and analyzes the relationship between the reality of the time and the characteristics revealed in Bang Jeonghwan’s juvenile novels."

Such a change has made our lives more convenient, but it means coexistence with new beings. Science education has hitherto transformed in a variety of ways by reflecting the demands of this new era. However, no studies have offered an overall point of direction for science education provided by a dynamic situation of connection between the explosive growth of networks and nonhuman beings. Therefore, the present study attempted to shed light on the direction and implications of science education in the era of artificial intelligence with a focus on the autonomy and relatedness of artificial intelligence. The results of the study indicated a semi-autonomous level of autonomy for artificial intelligence when compared to humans. This means there are limitations with regard to insights into error issues that can occur in data use and their resolution. With that said the huge increase in processing speed for big data has improved the quality and the amount of information available from an aspect of science education. Therefore, Transcending the instrumental use of artificial intelligence simply for data collection, the role of the teacher is to serve as a mediator for coexistence with regard to big data-based knowledge. Furthermore, it must offer a new concept of core competencies, which adds human emotional value elements to a problem-solving competency emphasized by science education. From an aspect of relatedness with artificial intelligence, it must avoid modern binary thinking and transcend the interaction-based contemporary perspective, with an aim at a more organic relationship concept―a systematic perspective. Furthermore, the convenience and flexibility of expression possessed by artificial intelligence enables a pluralistic interpretation of creativity and the pursuit of diversity in manifestations of group creativity. In addition, the building of an adaptive teaching environment and the sharing of cognitive resources, as a result of organizing learning communities with artificial intelligence, will show a new concept of science learning. The present study is expected to serve as a scale for wisely preparing for the approaching new era by presenting a direction for a science education necessary to a shortened cycle of technological advancement and the era of artificial intelligence and subsequently by producing the right model of talent."

COVID-19가 팬데믹(Pandamic) 수준으로 선포 되기 이전에 구성원들은 리더들이 내재적/외재적 보상에 더욱 공을 들이고 수평적 조직문화를 만들어주기를 기대한 반면, COVID-19 시대에는 심리적 안전감, 잦은 소통, 미래에 대한 방향성 제시 등을 요구하고 있었다. 이와 같은 위기 상황에서 부각되는 리더십을 본 연구자들은 변혁적 리더십으로 간주하고 두 번째 연구를 설계하여 구성원들의 태도변수인 회복 탄력성과 관계를 실증했다. 회복 탄력성은 위기 상황에서 구성원들이 갖춰야 할 요소로 자주 언급된다. 변혁적 리더십이 COVID-19 시대에 도 회복 탄력성에 유의미하게 영향을 미치는지 살펴봤다. 분석 결과, 변혁적 리더십은 회복 탄력성과 정(+)의 관계를 가지고, 정서적 몰입은 변혁적 리더십과 회복 탄력성의 관계를 부분적으로 매개하였다. 본 연구는 COVID-19 이후로 요구되는 위기 리더십을 데이터로 규명했다는데 실무적으로 기여점을 가지고 있다. 더불어, 위기 상황에서 종종 강조되는 구성원 태도인 회복 탄력성과 관련성을 실증했다는 이론적인 기여점이 있다.","Many organizations are under crisis due to the pandemic of COVID-19, and they may need to understand different leadership during the crisis. This study consisted of two phases. In the first phase, leadership required after COVID-19 was studied by topical modeling which is one of data mining techniques. In the second phase, the primary purpose was to study the correlation between perceived leadership behaviors and personal performance through empirical analysis. Specifically, we analyzed the change in perceived leadership demanded by members of an organization by comparing before and after the declaration of COVID-19. Prior to the declaration, the members frequently mentioned leadership behaviors related to intrinsic and external rewards. After the declaration, on the other hand, words and phrases related to psychological safety, effective communication, and clear direction to the future were frequently observed. Based on the results of the first study, we determined the transformational leadership as the kind of leadership demanded during a crisis like COVID-19, and the second study was designed to test the relationship between perceived transformational leadership and the individual resilience among the members of the organization. In addition, we hypothesized that affective commitment mediates the relationship between the two variables, and the mediation was tested. As a result, we observed a positive relationship between the perceived transformational leadership and the individual resilience, and it was evident that affective commitment partially mediates the relationship. This research contributes to reveal the leadership behaviors demanded in the crisis of COVID-19 by the data mining technique which is important in HR practices. In addition, this research has a theoretical contribution by investigating the leadership style demanded during the time of a crisis and by relating to the individual attitudes. finally, limitations of this research and directions of future research are discussed."

Propp)와 그레마스(A. J. Greimas)의 스토리텔링 구조를 수정 · 보완한 것들이다. 문제는 영상작품의 스토리텔링 구조가 민담에서 보이는 시간논리의 구조, 행동논리의 구조, 선과 악, 권선징악의 프레임을 벗어나지 못한다는 것이다. 주인공과 악당을 뒤바꾸어 이야기를 구성하는 경우에도 기본 프레임에는 변화가 없으며, 이와 같은 서구의 영상 스토리텔링과 구조는 현실과 동떨어진 것이다. 더 나아가 이러한 스토리텔링은 시청자로 하여금 현실을 벗어나 신화적 프레임 안으로 들어가도록 만드는 역할을 한다. 본고는 이에 대한 반례로서 한국의 가장 대중적인 영화와 드라마를 몇 가지 소개하고 서구가 지향해왔던 스토리텔링의 프레임을 비판하였다. 예술, 문학 작품의 구조를 포괄적이고 종합적으로 연구해온 기호학의 전통에 따라 영상 스토리텔링의 유기적인 구조를 설명하고, 사례 또한 포괄적으로 제시하여 각 구조의 어느 부분에 고정된 모티브의 경직성이 존재하는지 논의하였으며, 나아가 이를 극복하는 방법은 무엇인지에 대해 고찰하였다.  한국의 영상 스토리텔링이 지닌 내러티브 구조는 비교적 유연하며, 시간의 논리나 행동의 논리구조에 많은 자유가 존재한다. 특히 인물 캐릭터의 경우 다중성과 비정형성이 돋보인다. 이는 한국의 영상 스토리텔링이 주어진 시나리오나 내러티브에 종속하지 않고 현실과 많은 상호작용을 가진 결과로 이해할 수 있을 것이다. 아울러 본 연구는 단순한 서구 영상문화의 비판이 아닌, 스토리텔링의 구조를 최대한 현실에 가깝게 밀착시킴으로써 보다 다양하고 대중친화적인 영상문화를 추구하고자 하는데 그 의의가 있다.","This theoretical study, with some cases analyses, is to explore some possibilities to transform the Western-oriented storytelling and its structure which has been detached from the reality. For this purpose, Korean dramas could give an important reference.  The storytelling and its narrative structure, discovered by V. Prop and A. J. Greimas, in their contemporary forms are influenced by some kind of duality; good and bad, heroes and antagonists, helpers and opponents, subject and object etc. And this duality has made the vast majority of stories didactic by encouraging good and punishing evil. But this kind of duality is far from the true and realities as well. It misleads public opinion on the realities as an ideological form.  This study presents an alternative model of storytelling by introducing some Korean dramas commonly and for a long time credited by their public. In the dramas, we could find very another forms of structures, functions, personalities in the duality perspective, even triple or multiple aspects.  The duality in storytelling is too mathematical and vectorial to feel, perceive and understand the true and reality, which are completely different of the Western storytelling has learned wrongly to public since long before. By introducing some examples of Korean movies and dramas and overcoming this, we could make our mentality more closely to the reality."

This paper aimed to explore the class struggle implications of a new family model reproduced in two contemporary two novels that intensively show this tendency.  First, Kim Hye-jin’s novel, “About Daughter”, is on that shows that today’s family is supported through the care work of women, also called mother workers or shadow labor. Furthermore, since women in proletarian families often engage in caring work socially, they are bound to neglect caring work in their own family. This is also the cause of the family breakup phenomenon that is occurring today. However, it is to accuse the illusion of the bourgeois family through different ways of caring, caring through money and caring through love, and looking for the true meaning of family in a system of love that embraces the other It may be seen as the political implication of the Kim Hye-jin novel.  On the other hand, from Seerang Jeong’s view, starts from the fantasy that if women who died miserably due to the violence of the patriarchal order like Na Hye-seok in the early modernization period lived and built a household. However, this novel embodies the appearance of a family as a kind of civic union that cooperates and solidifies with each other without oppressing individuals whose feminine values are realized, but such a family can only be made on the premise of certain assets and possessions. A suggestion may be made that money itself may be forgotten in the quest for pecuniary gain which leads one to assess the novel as fantastical.  Today, the family is an area with the most acute class struggle implications. It seems to be one of the most important tasks in 21st century novels to view the family as a miniature version, or microcosm, of society as it will be defined in the future. This is because the stronger the individualization trend, the more important the family will be given as a medium connecting society and individuals."

(1) 지식재산 환경의 변화와 (2) 지식재산법제의 글로벌한 변화를 숙지하고, (3) 지식재산에 관한 국제재판관할법제와의 정합성과 (4) 지식재산의 준거법에 관한 국제규범과의 정합성을 고려하면서도 (5) 지식재산의 모든 법률관계의 준거법 지정에 통용될 수 있는 일반 원칙을 제시하고 (6) 지식재산과 관련하여 높아진 대한민국의 국제적 위상을 반영하여 (7) 세계를 선도하는 선진적 입법을 제시하여야 할 것이다. 이러한 관점에서 필자는 지식재산 관련 준거법결정원칙으로 당사자자치의 원칙과 최밀접관련국법원칙을 주창하였다. 다만 당사자자치의 원칙을 관철하는 경우 부당한 결과가 나올 수 있으므로 그에 대한 적절한 한계를 설정하는 작업이 추가 되어야 하고 최밀접관련국 판단에 있어서도 구체적 기준을 제시하여 준거법 지정에 관한 공정성과 예측가능성을 제고하고자 하였다. 준거법 지정에 관한 예측가능성 제고는 기준의 제시로 가능할 수 있을 것이나 준거법의 공정성 확보는 국제사법 만으로는 해결하기 어려운 난제라 할 것이다.","The transformation of the social environment triggered by the information revolution and the subsequent Fourth Industrial Revolution are forcing drastic changes in all legal norms in our society, including private international law and intellectual property law. Due to these changes in the environment, ADR is preferred over litigation in dispute resolution, and the major issues in private international law such as international jurisdiction and recognition & enforcement of foreign judgments are gradually decreasing day due to reduction of court cases. Also it became difficult to determine the governing law of a legal issue due to lack of or, at least, unclarity of the connecting factors(Anknuefungspunkt) thereto. Furthermore, as the need of interference of public law such as competition law has increased, rooms for the conflict of laws rule for application of private law tends to become diminishing. We are entering into an age that the fate of private international law is in crisis. In the field of intellectual property law, the focus has shifted from patents to copyrights for a long time, and now the focus is shifting from protection of intellectual property rights to protection from tortious acts such as trade secrets infringement and unfair competition. Furthermore, even in the subject of protection, the focus is shifting to protecting data and other intangible property itself, rather than creative works and achievements. In this paper, we look at these changes in the social environment from the point of view of intellectual property and try to find new standards for determining the law applicable thereto. In order to establish a new standard for determining the governing law of intellectual property issues, it is necessary to pay attention to the following points: (1) changes in the intellectual property environment; (2) global changes in the legal system of intellectual property; (3) compatibility with the international legal system of jurisdiction regarding intellectual property; (4) compatibility with international norms on the governing law of intellectual property; (5) carving general principles applicable to the governing law for various situations of intellectual property; (6) reflecting the upgraded status of Korea at the international intellectual property community; and (7) proposing of a model legislation for the days to come in the globalized world.  From this point of view, the author advocated the principle of party autonomy and the principle of the most closely connected country as the principles for determining the law governing intellectual property instead of the traditional principles of lex protectionis or law of the origin. However, since allowance of the full party autonomy may results in unfairness, the setting of appropriate limits to the freedom of choice of law must be secured, and concrete and specific standards for determining the most closely connected country should be presented to enhance fairness and predictability of the governing law to be applied. Although it may be possible to improve the predictability of the governing law by adopting the above mentioned standards, realization of the fairness after application of such determined governing law would be a conundrum that can be hardly solved by the private international law alone."

This approach is based on the fact that it is necessary to enter the stage of reboot from the modern correctional ideology, breaking away from the limit of detention and punishment, which are traditional behavior ideology. In Korea, there are few discussions on correctional therapy community in academia or practice, or there are no cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. At first, the therapeutic community has developed into a self-help approach to problems related to drug abuse. Today, when we look at the trend of social research that is developing related to the therapeutic community, we diagnosed that the institution treatment community should be converted, transformed and expanded into various forms in the area, and made policy suggestions along with its necessity. First, the basic philosophy of the correctional institution therapeutic community requires the basis of the recovery philosophy of life for prisoners and the basic related laws and regulations. Second, it was suggested in the aspect of 'destructive innovation' that the capacity plan to expand and reorganize the social rehabilitation department of the correctional institution to ‘head of correction treatment ' should be devised and implemented. Third, the policy criticism that manualized programs such as the wall have shown loopholes in the strategic responsiveness of the enforcement of the correctional policy, as there are cases where the target prisoners are not executed. Finally, the significance of this study is an exploratory study that presented the concept and model of the correctional institution therapeutic community. If the correctional institution therapeutic community is introduced and realized in the future, it will be a social settlement that restores the collapsed correctional institution community through healing and treatment, and it will contribute to the re-offending, national integration and development of the correctional welfare field."

During the period of system transformation of 1990-2010, Hungary had displayed the politics of recognition with a relatively stable democracy. In that era, Hungary had been regarded as a model country of both democratic transition and successful capitalization of economy. Since 2010, however, the Orbán administration and the Fidesz Party have deliberately damaged Hungary’s politics with their populist policies, almost coming near to authoritarianism. Owing to Orbán’s populism, it can be argued that in Hungary the politics of recognition has degenerated into the ‘politics of antagonism.’  As Yascha Mounk pointed out, three tasks of domesticating of nationalism, fixing of the economy, and renewing of civic faith and civic education are necessary in order to overcome the abuses of populism. In addition to that, the awakening of critical forces and the solidarity of the political society are needed in Hungary to redemocratize and to recover the politics of recognition. All these tasks depend on the possibility of the revitalization of civil society. The role of European Union as an outside factor also can contribute to the vitalization of civil society in the Central European countries including Hungary. The topic of civil society’s vitalization, once actively discussed in the 1980s, should be brought forward in both Western and East-Central Europe in the 2020s."
다중 레이블 분류의 정확도 향상을 위한 스킵 연결 오토인코더 기반 레이블 임베딩 방법론,2021,"['딥 러닝', '다중 레이블 분류', '레이블 임베딩', '오토인코더', '스킵 연결', 'Deep Learning', 'Multi-Label Classification', 'Label Embedding', 'AutoEncoder', 'Skip-Connection']",,"Recently, with the development of deep learning technology, research on unstructured data analysis is being actively conducted, and it is showing remarkable results in various fields such as classification, summary, and generation. Among various text analysis fields, text classification is the most widely used technology in academia and industry. Text classification includes binary class classification with one label among two classes, multi-class classification with one label among several classes, and multi-label classification with multiple labels among several classes. In particular, multi-label classification requires a different training method from binary class classification and multi-class classification because of the characteristic of having multiple labels. In addition, since the number of labels to be predicted increases as the number of labels and classes increases, there is a limitation in that performance improvement is difficult due to an increase in prediction difficulty.  To overcome these limitations, (i) compressing the initially given high-dimensional label space into a low-dimensional latent label space, (ii) after performing training to predict the compressed label, (iii) restoring the predicted label to the high-dimensional original label space, research on label embedding is being actively conducted. Typical label embedding techniques include Principal Label Space Transformation (PLST), Multi-Label Classification via Boolean Matrix Decomposition (MLC-BMaD), and Bayesian Multi-Label Compressed Sensing (BML-CS). However, since these techniques consider only the linear relationship between labels or compress the labels by random transformation, it is difficult to understand the non-linear relationship between labels, so there is a limitation in that it is not possible to create a latent label space sufficiently containing the information of the original label. Recently, there have been increasing attempts to improve performance by applying deep learning technology to label embedding. Label embedding using an autoencoder, a deep learning model that is effective for data compression and restoration, is representative. However, the traditional autoencoder-based label embedding has a limitation in that a large amount of information loss occurs when compressing a high-dimensional label space having a myriad of classes into a low-dimensional latent label space.  This can be found in the gradient loss problem that occurs in the backpropagation process of learning. To solve this problem, skip connection was devised, and by adding the input of the layer to the output to prevent gradient loss during backpropagation, efficient learning is possible even when the layer is deep. Skip connection is mainly used for image feature extraction in convolutional neural networks, but studies using skip connection in autoencoder or label embedding process are still lacking.  Therefore, in this study, we propose an autoencoder-based label embedding methodology in which skip connections are added to each of the encoder and decoder to form a low-dimensional latent label space that reflects the information of the high-dimensional label space well. In addition, the proposed methodology was applied to actual paper keywords to derive the high-dimensional keyword label space and the low-dimensional latent label space. Using this, we conducted an experiment to predict the compressed keyword vector existing in the latent label space from the paper abstract and to evaluate the multi-label classification by restoring the predicted keyword vector back to the original label space.

To this end, 20 qualitative studies related to burnout were selected and qualitative meta-analysis was performed. The findings are as follows: First, the burnout process of the counselor was analyzed that there are couple of stages such as an Effort․Flow phase, Burnout phase, Recovery phase, Growth phase, the counselor may recover after burnout, but the recovering could lead to a circular process of returning to burnout again. In addition, after the counselor restored burnout, they were able to achieve growth such as birth into existence, individualized self, noticing and positive contact. Second, the risk factors in moving from the Effort․Flow phase to the Burnout phase are divided into individual factors and environmental factors, environmental factors acted as more risk factors than individual factors. In particular, the lack of awareness of counseling within the organization led to burnout when there was conflict or when the personal characteristics of the counselor individual and the qualities and expertise as a counselor were not prepared. Third, the developmental factors were coping factors and leap factors in moving from the Burnout phase to the Recovery phase and the Growth phase. The counselors promoted recovery and growth by focusing on self-care, transformation, strengthening professionalism, and exerting self-control Fourth, the concept and model of growth after burnout were presented based on the intergrated and intrinsic meaning research for the burnout process and causal factors."

Klee absorbed diverse art principles in the flow of abstraction but did not merely imitate or follow them. Instead, he adopted and visualized the highest level of polyphonic structure of music of the eighteenth century to his paintings. Particularly, Klee composed paintings in the manner of musical composers through the polyphonic principles of Mozart, for whom he had a profound affection through his life.  Klee’s polyphonic property set forth in deploying the simultaneity of the counterpoint in the fugue form on the flat surface of canvas based on line, color, and tone, which he regarded significant in the composition of painting. Taking inspiration from Mozart’s method of composing multi-thematic music with un-imitative plural themes, like his 41st Symphony “Jupiter” (K.551), Klee composed non-figurative forms or embodied the figures of specific objects with fundamental geometric forms such as circles, squares and triangles as well as simple curving lines. I refer to Mozart’s “Prague” Symphony to explain how Klee acquired various forms with the same motive used in diverse pieces by appropriating and transforming a single motive. Consequently, I argue that Klee achieved a sense of rhythm by forming and visualizing the temporality of music on the two-dimensional space of painting. Klee realized a model of convergent art through seeking and exploring painting with his affection for the world and objects in it."

Thus, variables were derived by analyzing prior data, and causal settings between variables and questionnaires were developed. Subject to the survey, 331 workers interested in participating in university education were collected through interpersonal interviews. The collected data were dataized, and reliability and feasibility verification and frequency analysis were conducted. Finally, we validate the fit of the structural equation model and the causal relationship for each concept. Therefore, the results of the validation show the following implications. First, university officials should be motivated by a mentor and mentee system with experienced people who have switched to a suitable vocational group through university education. It will also be necessary to develop and disseminate programs so that they can continue to develop themselves for the future. To this end, it will be necessary to help them understand their aptitude and strengths through consultation with experts. Second, university officials should strengthen public relations so that prospective students can know the cases and information of the job transformation of the admitted workers through recommendations.

Third, university officials should provide workers with a program that allows them to catch two rabbits: job transformation and self-improvement through university education. In other words, it is necessary to stimulate the motivation of workers by providing various information such as visiting advanced overseas companies, obtaining various certificates, moving between departments of blue-collar and white-collar, and transfer opportunities. Fourth, university officials should actively promote university education programs related to this by participating in university education and receiving systematic education and the flow of social environment. Finally, university officials will need to consult and promote workers so that they can self-develop when they participate in college education, and they will have to figure out what they need for self-development through demand surveys and analysis."
근현대 주거 건축에서 나타나는 기술 인식 변화에 관한 연구 - 빌라 사보아와 보르도 주택의 비교를 중심으로 -,2021,"['Residential Architecture', 'Technology', 'Universality', 'Specificity', 'Habitability', '주거건축', '기술', '보편성', '특정성', '거주성']",,"(Background and Purpose) The internal function of the dwelling is directly related to the physiological needs of humans, and it has been developed while maintaining the main framework without changing, even amid changes during modern and contemporary periods. The inseparable relationship between technological civilization and society is reflected in the relationship between housing and technology. Therefore, proposals for single housing have varied results, depending on how architects perceive technology. Accordingly, this study discussed how the change in the perception of technology distinguishes between modern and contemporary residential architectural design and how it defines habitability in the city. (Method) To this end, the conceptual framework analyzed specific residential architecture cases by categorizing them into envelope design, structural systems, room arrangements, and facility spaces. At this time, technology was examined by dividing it into notional and instrumental factors according to how it was revealed in the living space. For this study, the residential works of Le Corbusier and Rem Koolhaas were selected, and they show a clear difference in the attitudes toward technology recognition according to the changes of the times. In particular, Villa Savoye and Bordeaux House share a similar architectural language in terms of technology, and they form an intriguing relationship. Therefore, it was judged that the comparison of the two houses was appropriate to reveal the difference in the perception of technology according to the changes during modern and contemporary periods. (Results) The Villa Savoye can be seen as a means of creating a rational and universal place with modern ideals through a homogeneous interior using the domino structure. Technology was intended to represent the transparency of an efficient mechanism and was the result of emphasizing the notional aspect of technology. In contrast, in Maison Bordeaux, Rem Koolhaas shows the perspective of reconstructing the universality of modern housing and transforming it into a dwelling as a concrete solution. Furthermore, he emphasized the instrumental aspect of technology to secure specificity from a universal housing model responding to anonymity. (Conclusions) The analysis of modern and contemporary residential architecture cases according to the category of technology reveals that the difference in technology perception affects distinct definitions of habitability. Unlike the modern era, when technology was regarded as an external factor in altering housing, technology in modern cities is recognized as an integral part. Discussion and technology on the inhabitability of modern cities are inextricably linked, but conversely, it has important implications in that it shows the possibility of creating conditions for habitability today, depending on how technology is recognized and applied."

Ⅲ장의 <무한･포옹 2020-2021> 연작은 첫째, 시지각적 전달체인 물성이 ‘이음’으로 접촉하는 ‘가능태’로, 둘째, 물러섬의 태도로 해체되는 과정에서 새로운 이미지가 드러나는 ‘잠재태’로 작용한다. 셋째, 앞선 ‘이음’과 ‘해체’의 과정을 통합된 ‘담지체’로 삼아 변주화하며 물성이 단순히 분위기 연출의 상태가 아닌 다양한 창작으로 ‘범주화’할 수 있음을 알아보았다.

In addition, whether the sensuous information of visual perception recognized as property of matter could not stay in psychological ‘individualization’, with mutual connection and tuning, which could be expanded into the presence of various art ‘categorization’ and creation is investigated in terms of researcher analysis of work  Property of matter contains the emotional judgement of material and texture, shape as well as activity and emotional attitude, and has the meaning as emotional media as physical dimension and psycho visual synesthesia imagination involved in terms of product of artwork. In a sense, in chapter Ⅱ this article examined formativeness of property of matter and psycho visual contents divided into three parts according to artwork. First, the process is attributed to two-dimensional limited format of planar characteristics, ‘abstractness’ as physical represented, and to cognition process of brain with physiological sensuous stimulus of visual perception which could mind internalized by color and touching. Specifically, characteristic of Gestalt-theorie psychology understood as ‘unique wholeness of oneness’ is involved in it,  in respect of cognitive psychology, ‘reality’ of abstract art asks art appreciator apple and interprets by him/herself, so in spite of ambiguity and obscurity ‘valuable reality’ regenerated through in-depth underlying movement of mind across all artworks. For example, visual image of artist is recreated in our brain, and constructs a model of perceived and emotional recreation. Second, when property of matter is perceived as representation of touching, the practical suggestion of material acts as generation process and creative energy for ‘meaning’ through memory and trace of psychological time to creator as well as art appreciator. Property of matter is not returned into object and state of direction, but becomes ‘dynamis’ of categorization. Third, with psychological twofold meaning derived from relationship between object and subject, through new ‘creation of relationship’ the meaning obtains dimension of depth and overlooks the whole, so the characteristics which make one ‘suddenly’ encounter state and situation were investigated.  In chapter Ⅲ, for 2020-2021 series, 〈Infinity, embracing〉 connected into researcher analysis of artwork, property of matter as media of the emotion induced by sensitivity necessarily arouses continuous psychological and aesthetic interpretation and is linked with regeneration and expansion. The attraction of infinite variation is based on principle of change which could capture the delicate qualitative variation. In summary, first, property of matter of visual and psychological media is transformed into acceptance and ‘connectedness’, i.e., ‘potentiality’. Second, dispersion and extinction of property of matter functions as ‘potentiality’ of new image with process dissolved into ‘attitude of recession’. Third, the variation by theme functions according to the previous process of ‘connectedness’ and ’dissolution’ serving as combined and unique ‘supporting carrier’.  As discussed above, property of matter as well as major material, i.e., ‘Seokchae’ and cystal powder could overcome material ‘triviality’, and could tune sensuously, which not only supports the visual-spatial whole, but also be reduced into oneness. That is, there is the deep and precious one’s inner heart concluded into ‘syn-aesthetic categorization’.  Finally in Ⅳ chapter, psychological representation could move through visual psychology and visual perception of eyes and mind, and while representation material touch is perceived into property of matter, unceasingly containing demand of change in the mind artistic as well as intel"

Enzymes and Their Reaction Mechanisms in Dimethylsulfoniopropionate Cleavage and Biosynthesis of Dimethylsulfide by Marine Bacteria,2021,"['Dimethylsulfide', 'Dimethylsulfoniopropionate', 'Molecular modeling', 'Methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase', 'Sulfur recycle']",,"In marine ecosystems, the biosynthesis and catabolism of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) by marine bacteria is critical to microbial survival and the ocean food chain. Furthermore, these processes also influence sulfur recycling and climate change. Recent studies using emerging genome sequencing data and extensive bioinformatics analysis have enabled us to identify new DMSP-related genes. Currently, seven bacterial DMSP lyases (DddD, DddP, DddY, DddK, DddL, DddQ and DddW), two acrylate degrading enzymes (DddA and DddC), and four demethylases (DmdA, DmdB, DmdC, and DmdD) have been identified and characterized in diverse marine bacteria. In this review, we focus on the biochemical properties of DMSP cleavage enzymes with special attention to DddD, DddA, and DddC pathways. These three enzymes function in the production of acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) and CO<sub>2</sub> from DMSP. DddD is a DMSP lyase that converts DMSP to 3-hydroxypropionate with the release of dimethylsulfide. 3-Hydroxypropionate is then converted to malonate semialdehyde by DddA, an alcohol dehydrogenase. Then, DddC transforms malonate semialdehyde to acetyl-CoA and CO<sub>2</sub> gas.

Then, it looks at what differentiates these characteristics from the previous period. At the same time, it tried to make a judgement on whether the result of this analysis could be an opportunity for a new type of search in the political elite type study. As a result of the study, the Chinese political elite, taking the case of the 19<sup>th</sup> Communist Party Central Committee as an example, had a somewhat stronger degree of integration, a weakened level of differentiation, a wider range of cycles, and a constant radical change in its methods. Based on this, it can be said that the latest type of political elite in China has changed to a more dived/quasi-replacement type, unlike the previous reform and opening period. Also, according to the results of this study, it was judged that the possibility of modification of the ‘analytical framework relating unity, differentiation and circulation to types of political elites’ raised in the study of the 18th period was not very large."

MCN은 생존 모색 차원에서 사업 모델을 다각화해 왔다. 이들의 사업 모델은 전통적인 방송 산업의 재원 모델을 침식하는 한편, 기존 방송사업자의 사업 변화를 추동해 왔고, 이 과정에서 기존 법규제의 한계를 드러내면서 새로운 정책 대응의 필요성이 대두됐다. 최근 논란이 된 유튜브 ‘뒷광고’ 논란이나 급부상하는 라이브 커머스 영역에 대한 규제 대응에서 드러나듯이, 현재의 규제 대응 기조는 기존 규제 체제로의 포섭을 시도하거나, 규제 공백 상태를 유지하는 형태로 진행되고 있다. 그러나, MCN 등장 이후 미디어 시장의 변동 양상은 특정 사업자의 특정 시장행위에 대한 단편적 규제 대응이 아닌 기존 규제 시스템의 총체적인 재정립을 강제하고 있다. 기존의 규제 포섭론, 탈규제론, 규제 유보론과 같은 단방향성 정책 담론을 벗어나 새로운 균형 상태를 창출하기 위한 양방향성 정책 대응이 요구된다. 이를 위해 기존의 존재론적 · 고정적 규제 대응을 넘어 기능적 · 유동적 규제 대응 시스템을 고안할 필요가 있다.",

The phenomenon is affected by several parameters, but we focused on the velocity and the size of the rotating body. In the precedent research, we observed that a critical velocity existed for the occurrence of the phenomenon, and the phenomenon’s grade was related to the velocity. Therefore, this study, using a discrete element method, aimed to analyze the relation between the velocity and the size of the rotating body for the occurrence of the phenomenon and perform a fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis to determine the correlation between the phenomenon and the period. The study observed that the critical velocity could vary from the velocity and the size of the rotating body, and there was a certain range of frequency for the occurrence of the Washboarding phenomenon."

Beginning in the late 1980s, this idea began to change when a new development scheme known as the human rights-based approach (HRBA) emerged; this approach promotes the civil and political rights of marginalized local people. Aid NGOs have begun to undertake political activities in the hope of producing long-term development effects. However, some NGOs have maintained a traditional mission limited to humanitarian relief. This study claims that the civic culture of an NGO’s home country makes a difference, and that NGOs embedded in democratic cultures are more receptive to the HRBA, while NGOs in closed cultures have maintained traditional relief missions. This comparative research examines two branches of Oxfam International, Oxfam America and Oxfam Japan, to investigate how the distinctive civic culture of their respective home countries conditioned each organization’s response to the rise of human rights-based models in aid strategies embraced by Oxfam International."

The discussion of transitional justice has emerged as a practical necessity to explain how a country that has experienced the destruction of democracy in the past overcomes past injustices and forms democratic legitimacy in the process of political transformation of the transition to democracy. According to Teitel""s discussion of transitional justice, the expansion and standardization of transitional justice, emerges as a key issue in the third phase that begins at the end of the 20th century. In terms of transitional justice, reparative justice is meaningful in that it is the starting point for the realization of justice for the future political community. However, the Chun Doo-hwan administration used a strategy of selective inclusion and exclusion while providing economic compensation to the May 18 victims. According to the selection of the military regime, there was a crack and a gap between the beneficiaries and the victims who were excluded from compensation. The May 18 transitional justice needs to be transformed into a political project that can be combine political and social recognition, trust, and solidarity on a wider level, beyond the judicial and corrective justice of the individual victim."
