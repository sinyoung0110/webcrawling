A novel classification approach based on Naive Bayes for Twitter sentiment analysis,2017,"['Twitter sentiment analysis', 'Machine learning', 'Naive Bayes', 'Attribute weighting', 'Feature selection']",,"With rapid growth of web technology and dissemination of smart devices, social networking service(SNS) is widely used. As a result, huge amount of data are generated from SNS such as Twitter, and sentiment analysis of SNS data is very important for various applications and services. In the existing sentiment analysis based on the Naive Bayes algorithm, a same number of attributes is usually employed to estimate the weight of each class. Moreover, uncountable and meaningless attributes are included. This results in decreased accuracy of sentiment analysis. In this paper two methods are proposed to resolve these issues, which reflect the difference of the number of positive words and negative words in calculating the weights, and eliminate insignificant words in the feature selection step using Multinomial Naive Bayes(MNB) algorithm. Performance comparison demonstrates that the proposed scheme significantly increases the accuracy compared to the existing Multivariate Bernoulli Naive Bayes(BNB) algorithm and MNB scheme."
Weighted Local Naive Bayes Link Prediction,2017,"['Complex Network', 'Link Prediction', 'Naive Bayes Model', 'Weighted Network']",,"Weighted network link prediction is a challenge issue in complex network analysis. Unsupervised methods based on local structure are widely used to handle the predictive task. However, the results are still far from satisfied as major literatures neglect two important points: common neighbors produce different influence on potential links; weighted values associated with links in local structure are also different. In this paper, we adapt an effective link prediction model―local naive Bayes model into a weighted scenario to address this issue. Correspondingly, we propose a weighted local naive Bayes (WLNB) probabilistic link prediction framework. The main contribution here is that a weighted cluster coefficient has been incorporated, allowing our model to inference the weighted contribution in the predicting stage. In addition, WLNB can extensively be applied to several classic similarity metrics. We evaluate WLNB on different kinds of real-world weighted datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed approach performs better (by AUC and Prec) than several alternative methods for link prediction in weighted complex networks."

Naive Bayes 기반 안드로이드 악성코드 분석 기술 연구,2017,"['Malware', 'Classification', 'Naive bayes']","스마트 폰의 보급률이 증가함에 따라 스마트 폰을 대상으로 하는 악성코드들이 증가하고 있다. 360 Security의 스마트 폰 악성코드 통계에 따르면 2015년 4분기에 비해 2016년 1분기에 악성코드가 437% 증가하는 수치를 보였다. 특히 이러한 스마트 폰 악성코드 유포의 주요 수단인 악성 어플리케이션들은 사용자 정보 유출, 데이터 파괴, 금전 갈취 등을 목적으로 하는데 운영 체제나 프로그래밍 언어가 제공하는 기능을 제어할 수 있게 해주는 인터페이스인 API에 의하여 동작하는 경우가 대부분이다. 본 논문에서는 정적 분석으로 도출한 어플리케이션 내 API의 패턴을 지도 학습 기법으로 머신에 학습하여 정상 어플리케이션과 악성 어플리케이션 내의 API 패턴의 유사도에 따라 악성 어플리케이션을 탐지하는 메커니즘을 제시하고 샘플 데이터에 대하여 해당 메커니즘을 사용하여 도출한 label 별 탐지율과 탐지율 개선을 위한 기법을 보인다. 특히, 제안된 메커니즘의 경우 신종 악성 어플리케이션의 API 패턴이 기존에 학습된 패턴과 일정 수준 유사한 경우 탐지가 가능하며 향후 어플리케이션의 다양한 feature를 연구하여 본 메커니즘에 적용한다면 anti-malware 체계의 신종 악성 어플리케이션 탐지에 사용될 수 있을 것이라 예상된다.","As the penetration rate of smartphones increases, the number of malicious codes targeting smartphones is increasing. I 360 Security""s smartphone malware statistics show that malicious code increased 437 percent in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. In particular, malicious applications, which are the main means of distributing malicious code on smartphones, are aimed at leakage of user information, data destruction, and money withdrawal. Often, it is operated by an API, which is an interface that allows you to control the functions provided by the operating system or programming language. In this paper, we propose a mechanism to detect malicious application based on the similarity of API pattern in normal application and malicious application by learning pattern of API in application derived from static analysis. In addition, we show a technique for improving the detection rate and detection rate for each label derived by using the corresponding mechanism for the sample data. In particular, in the case of the proposed mechanism, it is possible to detect when the API pattern of the new malicious application is similar to the previously learned patterns at a certain level. Future researches of various features of the application and applying them to this mechanism are expected to be able to detect new malicious applications of anti-malware system."

Existing methods to analyze informal data are based mainly on the frequency of informal data, however, this research tries to use correlation information of each informal data. Method: After sentimental analysis to acquire the user information for automobile products, three classification methods, that is, naive Bayes, random forest, and support vector machine, were employed to accurately classify the informal user opinions with respect to automobile qualities. Additionally, Word2vec was applied to discover correlated information about informal data. Result: As applicative results of three classification methods, random forest method shows most effective results compared to the other classification methods. Word2vec method manages to discover closest relevant data with automobile components. Conclusion: The proposed method shows its effectiveness in terms of accuracy and sensitivity on the analysis of informal quality data, however, only two sentiments (positive or negative) can be categorized due to human errors. Further studies are required to derive more sentiments to accurately classify informal quality data. Word2vec method also shows comparative results to discover the relevance of components precisely."

In the stage of a verification inspection, the human inspector sequentially inspects all the areas which detected in the automatic inspection. In this study, we propose an algorithm to determine the order of verification inspection by Bayes inference well known in the field of machine learning. This is a method of prioritizing a region estimated to have a high probability of defect using experience data of past inspection. This algorithm was applied to the visual inspection of ultraviolet filters to verify its effectiveness. As a result of the comparison experiment, it was confirmed that the verification inspection can be completed 30% of the conventional method by adapting proposed algorithm."
Attribute weighting for averaged one-dependence estimators,2017,,,"<P>Averaged one-dependence estimators (AODE) is a type of supervised learning algorithm that relaxes the conditional independence assumption that governs standard naive Bayes learning algorithms. AODE has demonstrated reasonable improvement in terms of classification performance when compared with a naive Bayes learner. However, AODE does not consider the relationships between the super-parent attribute and other normal attributes. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on AODE that weighs the relationship between the attributes called weighted AODE (WAODE), which is an attribute weighting method that uses the conditional mutual information metric to rank the relations among the attributes. We have conducted experiments on University of California, Irvine (UCI) benchmark datasets and compared accuracies between AODE and our proposed learner. The experimental results in our paper show that WAODE exhibits higher accuracy performance than the original AODE.</P>"

We used the Housing Condition Survey (HCS) by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport in Korea as a main dataset. We focused on the residential satisfaction of the respondents, detected the outliers, and performed an empirical analysis for impact factors. Although we used the Mahalanobis distance method, which is a common method for outlier detection, we found that this outlier detection method was unreliable. Alternatively, the Naive Bayes Classification method was utilized to detect the outliers and to verify the impact factors. This choice of method was based on the fact that the high correlation among the demographic characteristics and residential satisfaction of respondents are critical elements in the Naive Bayes Classification. The findings include that firstly, about 2,400 samples (12% of total) of the  2014 Housing Condition Survey  were detected as outliers. Secondly, it was observed that the tendency of positive over-estimation about questions from the residential satisfaction of respondents in HCS is common. Thirdly, in order to reduce the occurrence of outliers in HCS, it is necessary to lessen the stress of respondents by avoiding long questions in table form."
Memory-Efficient NBNN Image Classification,2017,"['Image classification', 'NBNN', 'Hashing', 'Memory efficiency', 'Indexing']",,"Naive Bayes nearest neighbor (NBNN) is a simple image classifier based on identifying nearest neighbors. NBNN uses original image descriptors (e.g., SIFTs) without vector quantization for preserving the discriminative power of descriptors and has a powerful generalization characteristic. However, it has a distinct disadvantage. Its memory requirement can be prohibitively high while processing a large amount of data. To deal with this problem, we apply a spherical hashing binary code embedding technique, to compactly encode data without significantly losing classification accuracy. We also propose using an inverted index to identify nearest neighbors among binarized image descriptors. To demonstrate the benefits of our method, we apply our method to two existing NBNN techniques with an image dataset. By using 64 bit length, we are able to reduce memory 16 times with higher runtime performance and no significant loss of classification accuracy. This result is achieved by our compact encoding scheme for image descriptors without losing much information from original image descriptors."

Development of the Drop-outs Prediction Model for Intelligent Drop-outs Prevention System,2017,"['Dropout Prediction Model', 'Naive Bays Algorithm']",,"The student dropout prediction is an indispensable for many intelligent systems to measure the educational system and success rate of all university. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an intelligent dropout prediction system that minimizes the situation by adopting the proactive process through an effective model that predicts the students who are at risk of dropout.  In this paper, the main data sets for students dropout predictions was used as questionnaires and university information. The questionnaire was constructed based on theoretical and empirical grounds about factor affecting student’s performance and causes of dropout. University Information included student grade, interviews, attendance in university life. Through these data sets, the proposed dropout prediction model techniques was classified into the risk group and the normal group using statistical methods and Naive Bays algorithm. And the intelligence dropout prediction system was constructed by applying the proposed dropout prediction model.  We expect the proposed study would be used effectively to reduce the students dropout in university."
Bayesian Approach to Users' Perspective on Movie Genres,2017,"['Item category prediction', 'Multivariate Bernoulli event model', 'Naive Bayes classification']",,"Movie ratings are crucial for recommendation engines that track the behavior of all users and utilize the information to suggest items the users might like. It is intuitively appealing that information about the viewing preferences in terms of movie genres is sufficient for predicting a genre of an unlabeled movie. In order to predict movie genres, we treat ratings as a feature vector, apply a Bernoulli event model to estimate the likelihood of a movie being assigned a certain genre, and evaluate the posterior probability of the genre of a given movie by using the Bayes rule. The goal of the proposed technique is to efficiently use movie ratings for the task of predicting movie genres. In our approach, we attempted to answer the question: ""Given the set of users who watched a movie, is it possible to predict the genre of a movie on the basis of its ratings?"" The simulation results with MovieLens 1M data demonstrated the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed technique, achieving an 83.8% prediction rate for exact prediction and 84.8% when including correlated genres."

The algorithms for prediction were naive Bayes, logistic regression, sequential minimal optimization, and J4.8. Results found that the majors of undergraduate students were successfully predicted by simple psycho-social factors. In addition, we found that prediction rates were affected by which type of data structure and algorithm were used.
