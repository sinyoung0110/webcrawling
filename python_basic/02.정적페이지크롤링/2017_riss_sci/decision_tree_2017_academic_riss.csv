IoT 센서 데이터를 이용한 단위실의 재실추정을 위한 Decision Tree 알고리즘 성능분석,2017,"['재실정보(Occupancy Information)', '재실추정(Occupancy estimation)', '사물 인터넷 데이터(IoT data)', '의사결정나무(Decision tree)', '데이터 마이닝(Data mining)']",,"Accurate prediction of stochastic behavior of occupants is a well known problem for improving prediction performance of building energy use. Many researchers have been tried various sensors that have information on the status of occupant such as CO2 sensor, infrared motion detector, RFID etc. to predict occupants, while others have been developed some algorithm to find occupancy probability with those sensors or some indirect monitoring data such as energy consumption in spaces. In this research, various sensor data and energy consumption data are utilized for decision tree algorithms (C4.5 & CART) for estimation of sub-hourly occupancy status. Although the experiment is limited by space (private room) and period (cooling season), the prediction result shows good agreement of above 95% accuracy when energy consumption data are used instead of measured CO2 value. This result indicates potential of IoT data for awareness of indoor environmental status."
Ensemble of Fuzzy Decision Tree for Efficient Indoor Space Recognition,2017,"['Indoor space recognition', 'Fuzzy Decision Tree', 'Boosted Tree', 'Adaboost', 'Super-pixel']",,"In this paper, we expand the process of classification to an ensemble of fuzzy decision tree. For indoor space recognition, many research use Boosted Tree, consists of Adaboost and decision tree. The Boosted Tree extracts an optimal decision tree in stages. On each stage, Boosted Tree extracts the good decision tree by minimizing the weighted error of classification. This decision tree performs a hard decision. In most case, hard decision offer some error when they classify nearby a dividing point. Therefore, We suggest an ensemble of fuzzy decision tree, which offer some flexibility to the Boosted Tree algorithm as well as a high performance. In experimental results, we evaluate that the accuracy of suggested methods improved about 13% than the traditional one."

"Prevalence and Determinants of Preterm Birth in Tehran, Iran: A Comparison between Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Methods",2017,"['preterm birth', 'risk factor', 'infant', 'logistic regression', 'decision tree']",,"Objectives: Preterm birth (PTB) is a leading cause of neonatal death and the second biggest cause of death in children under five years of age. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of PTB and its associated factors using logistic regression and decision tree classification methods.Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 4,415 pregnant women in Tehran, Iran, from July 6–21, 2015. Data were collected by a researcher-developed questionnaire through interviews with mothers and review of their medical records. To evaluate the accuracy of the logistic regression and decision tree methods, several indices such as sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the curve were used.Results: The PTB rate was 5.5% in this study. The logistic regression outperformed the decision tree for the classification of PTB based on risk factors. Logistic regression showed that multiple pregnancies, mothers with preeclampsia, and those who conceived with assisted reproductive technology had an increased risk for PTB (p < 0.05).Conclusion: Identifying and training mothers at risk as well as improving prenatal care may reduce the PTB rate. We also recommend that statisticians utilize the logistic regression model for the classification of risk groups for PTB."
Wine Quality Assessment Using a Decision Tree with the Features Recommended by the Sequential Forward Selection,2017,"['Decision Tree', 'Wine Quality', 'Classification', 'Sequential Forward Selection']",,"Nowadays wine is increasingly enjoyed by a wider range of consumers, and wine certification and quality assessment are key elements in supporting the wine industry to develop new technologies for both wine making and selling processes. There have been many attempts to construct a more methodical approach to the assessment of wines, but most of them rely on objective decision rather than subjective judgement. In this paper, we propose a data mining approach to predict human wine taste preferences that is based on easily available analytical tests at the certification step. We used sequential forward selection and decision tree for this purpose. Experiments with the wine quality dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository demonstrate the accuracies of 76.7% and 78.7% for red and white wines respectively."

Therefore, our goal is to present an automatic computer-aided system for brain image classification. We use 66 T2-weighted images downloaded from Harvard Medical School. In this paper, we propose to use SMRI as a biomarker. First we use 2D discrete wavelet transform (2D-DWT) along with Daubechies-4 from wavelet families for feature extraction from MRI. Second, principal component analysis (PCA) is employed for the reduction of the feature to only 10. Third, those reduced feature were fed to Bagged Trees classifier for classification. A 6-fold cross validation (CV) has showed the classification accuracy of 69.7% .Thus, Bagged Trees classifier is effective and this approach can be a beneficial tool in practical."

A review of tree-based Bayesian methods,2017,"['Bayesian additive regression trees', 'boosting', 'random forests', 'semiparametric Bayes']",,"Tree-based regression and classification ensembles form a standard part of the data-science toolkit. Many commonly used methods take an algorithmic view, proposing greedy methods for constructing decision trees; examples include the classification and regression trees algorithm, boosted decision trees, and random forests. Recent history has seen a surge of interest in Bayesian techniques for constructing decision tree ensembles, with these methods frequently outperforming their algorithmic counterparts. The goal of this article is to survey the landscape surrounding Bayesian decision tree methods, and to discuss recent modeling and computational developments. We provide connections between Bayesian tree-based methods and existing machine learning techniques, and outline several recent theoretical developments establishing frequentist consistency and rates of convergence for the posterior distribution. The methodology we present is applicable for a wide variety of statistical tasks including regression, classification, modeling of count data, and many others. We illustrate the methodology on both simulated and real datasets."
Forest Carbon Sequestration and Optimal Harvesting Decision Considering Spb Disturbance: A Real Options Approach,2017,"['real option', 'flexible harvest', 'carbon sequestration', 'southern pine beetle', 'value of uncertainty.']",,"This study evaluates the forest management decision making of loblolly pine forest in the southern U.S. using the real option approach. The study incorporates three uncertainties that forest owners have faced including timber price volatility, forest carbon sequestration, and impacts of insect outbreaks into the real option model to investigate the relationship between such uncertainties and forest bare land value and tree rotation age. The results show that forest owners can face a mixed outcome of these uncertainties when they make forest management decisions, and the real option approach helps the forest managers consider future consequence through allowing the flexible harvest decision. Generally, a higher bare land value is generated if a flexible harvest decision making (real option) is allowed compared to a fixed harvest. The standing tree sequestrates CO2, and the forest’s role of carbon sequestration could generate extra value in the forest while insect outbreaks reduce the bare land value. The increasing social cost of carbon tends to call for increasing the bare land value of forest tree rotation age. Therefore, as climate change becomes more looming due to CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, the value of standing forests would increase due to enhancing opportunity cost of carbon sequestration in forests. Continuous efforts of pest management for forests are necessary since a higher insect risk tends to reduce the bare land value of forests. Also, employing marketable climate policy such as emissions trading is necessary to create a market carbon price and offset extra cost to keep the forest."
Adaptive Prediction Method Based on Alternating Decision Forests with Considerations for Generalization Ability,2017,"['Data Mining', 'Big Data', 'Prediction Model', 'Random Forests', 'Alternating Decision Forests']",,"Many machine learning algorithms have been proposed and applied to a wide range of prediction problems in the field of industrial management. Lately, the amount of data is increasing and machine learning algorithms with low computational costs and efficient ensemble methods are needed. Alternating Decision Forest (ADF) is an efficient ensemble method known for its high performance and low computational costs. ADFs introduce weights representing the degree of prediction accuracy for each piece of training data and randomly select attribute variables for each node. This method can effectively construct an ensemble model that can predict training data accurately while allowing each decision tree to retain different features. However, outliers can cause overfitting, and since candidates of branch conditions vary for nodes in ADFs, there is a possibility that prediction accuracy will deteriorate because the fitness of training data is highly restrained. In order to improve prediction accuracy, we focus on the prediction results for new data. That is to say, we introduce bootstrap sampling so that the algorithm can generate out-of-bag (OOB) datasets for each tree in the training phase. Additionally, we construct an effective ensemble of decision trees to improve generalization ability by considering the prediction accuracy for OOB data. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct simulation experiments using the UCI machine learning repository. This method provides robust and accurate predictions for datasets with many attribute variables."

To increase the predictive power of the model, a regression analysis was used to derive meaningful variables. Based on the given variables, we compared the difference in predictive power between the artificial neural network, which is a machine learning analysis method, and the decision tree analysis method. As a result, the accuracy of artificial neural network was higher than that of decision trees when all variables were added in production/ investment model and distribution model. However, decision trees were more accurate when selected variables were applied according to regression analysis results. In the screening model, the accuracy of the artificial neural network was higher than the accuracy of the decision tree regardless of whether the regression analysis result was reflected or not.

For analyzing zero-inflated count data, zero-inflated Poisson and Hurdle models were developed. A zero-inflated decision tree was also developed, but it has a bias problem in selecting split variables and excessive computational cost. To solve these problems, an alternative decision tree algorithm has been proposed, but it is limited in that only certain types of zero-inflated data can be explained. Therefore, we propose a new decision tree based on a Hurdle model rather than a zero-inflated Poisson model to cover all forms of zero excess count data. Our proposed algorithm is based on residual analysis that separates split variable and point selections.

To do this, we collected the traffic accident data that occurred in Seoul for four years from 2012 to 2015, and classified as slight, serious, and death traffic accidents according to the severity of traffic accidents. The analysis of spatiotemporal characteristics of traffic accidents was performed by kernel density analysis, hotspot analysis, space time cube analysis, and Emerging HotSpot Analysis. The factors affecting the severity of traffic accidents were analyzed using decision tree model. The results show that traffic accidents in Seoul are more frequent in suburbs than in central areas. Especially, traffic accidents concentrated in some commercial and entertainment areas in Seocho and Gangnam, and the traffic accidents were more and more intense over time. In the case of death traffic accidents, there were statistically significant hotspot areas in Yeongdeungpo-gu, Guro-gu, Jongno-gu, Jung-gu and Seongbuk. However, hotspots of death traffic accidents by time zone resulted in different patterns. In terms of traffic accident severity, the type of accident is the most important factor. The type of the road, the type of the vehicle, the time of the traffic accident, and the type of the violation of the regulations were ranked in order of importance. Regarding decision rules that cause serious traffic accidents, in case of van or truck, there is a high probability that a serious traffic accident will occur at a place where the width of the road is wide and the vehicle speed is high. In case of bicycle, car, motorcycle or the others there is a high probability that a serious traffic accident will occur under the same circumstances in the dawn time."

This paper aims to examine how the structure of the local revenue affects the expenditure of local governments in Korea.The result shows that the structure of the local revenues affects the types of the expenditure of local governments. Especially the expenditure of the local governments is typified by welfare-related expenditure and public order-related expenditure according to the local revenue structure. Another result shows that the effect of the structure of the local revenue on the local expenditure can be different depending on the type of local governmen like Si(Cities), Gun(Counties), Gu(Districts). In the case of Si, the higher the proportion of local tax or conditional grant in local revenue, the higher the proportion of welfare-related expenditure in local expenditure. And the proportion of the expenditure related to public order is high as the share of non-local taxes is low or the share of non-conditional grant is high in local revenue. The proportion of welfare-related expenditure in Gu is higher when the proportion of local taxes or conditional grant is higher. On the other hand, the proportion of welfare-related expenditure in Gu is higher when the share of non-local tax is lower or the share of non-conditional grant is lower. The share of welfare-related expenditure is higher as the proportion of local tax or non-local tax is lower and the proportion of conditional grant is higher."

Service tree analysis structures the service based on the customer participation perspective and provides a qualitative analysis method categorizing the service elements on the basis of its impact to top service. This paper attempts to apply the concept of reliability importance to the service tree analysis as a perspective of quantitative analysis, which is considered little in Geum et al. [15]. Reliability importance is a measure of the structural impact of the components that make up the system on the system lifetime in reliability engineering field and often used in fault tree analysis. We transform the reliability importance into service importance in accordance with service tree analysis, so that the influence of service elements on the service can be judged and compared. The service importance is defined as the amount of change of the service according to the change of the service element, therefore, it can be utilized as an index for determining a service element for service improvement. In addition, as an index for paired service elements, the relationship between the two service components can be measured by joint service importance. This paper introduces conceptual changes in the process of applying reliability importance to service analysis, and shows how to use the service importance for identifying the priority of service element for the final service and improving customer satisfaction through an example. By using the service importance and joint service importance in service tree analysis, it is possible to make efficient decision making in the process of determining the service elements for analyzing and improving the service."

The findings from the stereotypes of Korean ICT companies are as follows. First, the companies are in need of technology policies that help R&D planning and market penetration. Second, policies must better support the companies working to sell new products or explore new business. Third, the companies need policies that support secure protection of development outcomes and proper management of IP rights. Fourth, the administrative procedures related to governmental support for ICT companies’ R&D projects must be simplified.  It is hoped that the outcome of this study will provide meaningful guidance in establishment, implementation and evaluation of technology policies for ICT SMEs, particularly to policymakers or researchers in relevant government agencies who determine R&D policies for ICT SMEs."

Data from Korea Welfare Panel Study (KOWEPS) 2008 and 2014 was used to analyze what factors affect household debt and how much each factor contributes by using the debts, assets, and expenditures of households as variables. Data mining technique (decision-making tree model) was applied to forecast the size of debt by the characteristics of households. The analysis found that 3 factors related to house (long-term lease (“Jeonse”) money deposit, debt, and debt interest) primarily led households to take out loans from financial institutions, which, in turn, further increased overall household debt. In 2014, the “gas and electricity expenses” of households increased to be the fifth largest contributing factor in terms of household debt growth, following the 3 house-related factors mentioned above and “other interest”. As for house-related debt, the following factors are provided in the order of contribution: living space, housing tenure status (owner-occupation or leased under “Jeonse” agreement, etc.), housing type (apartment or stand-alone house, etc.) and heating facility.Therefore, it is advisable that the Korean government’s policies aiming to curb the growing household debt focus not only on “loans from financial institutions,” but also on “Jeonse.” The Korean government also needs to pay attention to other types of buildings including commercial buildings for effective household debt control, and implement a policy to curb the growth of “gas and electricity expense.” Additionally, household debt management policy-making process needs to involve all the relevant government entities, rather than addressed single-handedly by the Financial Services Commission, so that policies tackling household debt growth can be far-reaching and comprehensive. An overall review of the current policies and a dramatic change in policy direction is deemed necessary."

"Benefits and challenges of agroforestry adoption: a case of Musebeya sector, Nyamagabe District in southern province of Rwanda",2017,"['Agroforestry adoption', 'challenges', 'Rwanda', 'socioeconomic and environmental beneﬁt']",,"Rwanda’s natural forest is under pressure due to increasing rural population growth and subsistence farming. The Rwanda Ministry of Agriculture has therefore introduced agroforestry technology in forest-dependent communities to minimize the pressures on the forests and improve local people’s livelihoods. This new technology has, however, not seen massive adoption in the country. This study examined the socioeconomic and environmental beneﬁts of the agroforestry technology introduced particularly in Nyamagabe District and the challenges facing its adoption. Results showed that the agroforestry practices are contributing to an increase in income of agroforestry adopters compared to non-agroforestry adopters, and are improving soil fertility, reducing deforestation, and conserving soil and water in the district. However, results showed that, due to lack of skills and technical know-how, capital and quality seeds, some farmers are declining to adopt the new agroforestry practices. The respondents perceived that by providing subsidies to farmers, regular training, and informal education, establishing tree nurseries to improve the production of quality seeds, and also involving farmers in decision-making will increase agroforestry adoption. The government and other stakeholders should consider the views expressed by the farmers and take the necessary steps to address these challenges facing agroforestry technology adoption."
The “Art of Trellis Decoding” Is Fixed-Parameter Tractable,2017,,,"<P>Given n subspaces of a finite-dimensional vector space over a fixed finite field F, we wish to find a linear layout V-1, V-2, ... , V-n of the subspaces such that dim((V-1 + V-2 + ... + V-i) boolean AND (Vi+1 + ... + V-n)) <= k for all i; such a linear layout is said to have width at most k. When restricted to 1-dimensional subspaces, this problem is equivalent to computing the trellis-width (or minimum trellis state-complexity) of a linear code in coding theory and computing the path-width of an F-represented matroid in matroid theory. We present a fixed parameter tractable algorithm to construct a linear layout of width at most k, if it exists, for input subspaces of a finite dimensional vector space over F. As corollaries, we obtain a fixed parameter tractable algorithm to produce a path-decomposition of width at most k for an input. F-represented matroid of path-width at most k, and a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm to find a linear rank-decomposition of width at most k for an input graph of linear rank-width at most k. In both corollaries, no such algorithms were known previously. Our approach is based on dynamic programming combined with the idea developed by Bodlaender and Kloks (1996) for their work on path-width and tree-width of graphs. It was previously known that a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm exists for the decision version of the problem for matroid path-width; a theorem by Geelen, Gerards, and Whittle (2002) implies that for each fixed finite field F, there are finitely many forbidden F-representable minors for the class of matroids of path-width at most k. An algorithm by Hlineny (2006) can detect a minor in an input F-represented matroid of bounded branch-width. However, this indirect approach would not produce an actual path-decomposition. Our algorithm is the first one to construct such a path-decomposition and does not depend on the finiteness of forbidden minors.</P>"

The data of Taekwondo competition used in this study were generated by decision tree model using data mining technique to find out factors and patterns related to win / loss. Decision trees were analyzed using SPSS clementine 11.1. The results were follow as:   1. The major factors and pattern of victory in Taekwondo competition were one pattern by face(3 points) and body(2 points). In other words, it is seen that winning rate is changed by acquiring score(2 points) and face(3 points), which are relatively easy to connect with score rather than body(3 points) or face(4 points).  2. Factors and patterns related to the defeat of Taekwondo games were also one pattern due to factors such as face(3 points) and body(2 points). This is because it allows more points for the body(2 points) and face(3 points), which are relatively easy to score, but it also can not score and can lead to a change in the defeat rate.  3. In the validity of the decision tree analysis used in this study, the hit rate for victory was 96% and the hit rate for defeat was 79.3%. This can be said to have yielded reasonable predictions."

Traffic Flow Estimation System using a Hybrid Approach,2017,"['Decision tree', 'Logistic regression', 'Support vector machine']",,"Nowadays, as traffic jams are a daily elementary problem in both developed and developing countries, systems to monitor, predict, and detect traffic conditions are playing an important role in research fields. Comparing them, researchers have been trying to solve problems by applying many kinds of technologies, especially roadside sensors, which still have some issues, and for that reason, any one particular method by itself could not generate sufficient traffic prediction results. However, these sensors have some issues that are not useful for research. Therefore, it may not be best to use them as stand-alone methods for a traffic prediction system. On that note, this paper mainly focuses on predicting traffic conditions based on a hybrid prediction approach, which stands on accuracy comparison of three prediction models: multinomial logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. This is aimed at selecting the most suitable approach by means of integrating proficiencies from these approaches. It was also experimentally confirmed, with test cases and simulations that showed the performance of this hybrid method is more effective than individual methods."

The former existing statistical methods, or variable selection and interpretation by experts, place limits on proper judgment. Accordingly, various data mining methods, including decision tree analysis, have been developed in recent years. Cart and C5.0 are representative algorithms for decision tree analysis, but these algorithms have limits in defining the tolerance of continuous explanatory variables. Also, target variables are restricted by the information that indicates only the quality of the products like the rate of defective products. Therefore it is essential to develop an algorithm that improves upon Cart and C5.0 and allows access to new quality information such as loss cost. In this study, a new algorithm was developed not only to find the major variables which minimize the target variable, loss cost, but also to overcome the limits of Cart and C5.0. The new algorithm is one that defines tolerance of variables systematically by adopting 3 categories of the continuous explanatory variables. The characteristics of larger-the-better was presumed in the environment of programming R to compare the performance among the new algorithm and existing ones, and 10 simulations were performed with 1,000 data sets for each variable. The performance of the new algorithm was verified through a mean test of loss cost. As a result of the verification show, the new algorithm found that the tolerance of continuous explanatory variables lowered loss cost more than existing ones in the larger is better characteristics. In a conclusion, the new algorithm could be used to find the tolerance of continuous explanatory variables to minimize the loss in the process taking into account the loss cost of the products."

Correspondingly, this study intends to quantitatively examine the impacts of contributing factors on the cyclist injury severity levels and to provide meaningful insight into prioritizing and specifying strategies for improving cyclist safety. To this end, a decision tree and ordered probit regression were integrated in this study. The findings showed that heavy vehicle use and cyclist age should be preferentially considered when implementing cyclist safety improvement strategies: targeting young heavy-vehicle drivers or cyclists, driver education regarding proper curve maneuvering and a law enforcement prohibition of speeding are suggested, and ITS-based traffic management system and road facilities would help enhance light vehicle driver visibility and senior cyclist alertness, particularly in horizontally curving road sections. These data-driven results could quantitatively support the policy makers or practitioners making decisions about prioritizing cyclist safety improvement strategy implementations and further specifying such strategies."

In this study, genetic data from populations of Southeast and Southwest Asia were collected, and several statistical approaches were evaluated on the Y-chromosome short tandem repeat data. In order to develop a more accurate and practical classification model, we applied gradient boosting and ensemble techniques. To infer between the Southeast and Southwest Asian populations, the overall performance of the classification models was better than that of the decision trees and regression models used in the past.

A Personalized and Learning Approach for Identifying Drugs with Adverse Events,2017,"['Adverse drug event', 'data mining', 'clinical decision making', 'learning']",,"Purpose: Adverse drug events (ADEs) are associated with high health and financial costs and have increased as more elderly patientstreated with multiple medications emerge in an aging society. It has thus become challenging for physicians to identify drugs causing adverse events. This study proposes a novel approach that can improve clinical decision making with recommendations on ADE causative drugs based on patient information, drug information, and previous ADE cases.Materials and Methods: We introduce a personalized and learning approach for detecting drugs with a specific adverse event, where recommendations tailored to each patient are generated using data mining techniques. Recommendations could be improvedby learning the associations of patients and ADEs as more ADE cases are accumulated through iterations. After consulting the system-generated recommendations, a physician can alter prescriptions accordingly and report feedback, enabling the systemto evolve with actual causal relationships.Results: A prototype system is developed using ADE cases reported over 1.5 years and recommendations obtained from decision tree analysis are validated by physicians. Two representative cases demonstrate that the personalized recommendations could contribute to more prompt and accurate responses to ADEs.Conclusion: The current system where the information of individual drugs exists but is not organized in such a way that facilitates the extraction of relevant information together can be complemented with the proposed approach to enhance the treatment of patientswith ADEs. Our illustrative results show the promise of the proposed system and further studies are expected to validate its performance with quantitative measures."

Therefore, automobile companies need to develop strategies to attract customers and promote their repurchase behaviors. To this end, this paper analyzed customer data from a Korean automobile company using data mining techniques to derive repurchase strategies.Design/methodology/approachWe conducted under-sampling to balance the collected data and generated 10 datasets. We then implemented prediction models by applying a decision tree, naive Bayesian, and artificial neural network algorithms to each of the datasets. As a result, we derived 10 patterns consisting of 11 variables affecting customers` decisions about repurchases from the decision tree algorithm, which yielded the best accuracy. Using the derived patterns, we proposed helpful strategies for improving repurchase rates.FindingsFrom the top 10 repurchase patterns, we found that 1) repurchases in January are associated with a specific residential region, 2) repurchases in spring or autumn are associated with whether it is a weekend or not, 3) repurchases in summer are associated with whether the automobile is equipped with a sunroof or not, and 4) a customized promotion for a specific occupation increases the number of repurchases."

Although ‘Kesu’ is commonly referred to as Katsura Tree (Cercidiphyllum japonicum Siebold & Zucc) these days, it was actually introduced to and planted in Korea during Japanese colonial era. Before then, the plant did not exist in Korean peninsula. Therefore, the present Cassia does not refer to the ‘Kesu’ found in Korea‘s ancient literatures.  If so, which tree was the real ‘Kesu’ that was referred to in Korea? ‘Kesu’, as it is already known, is an imaginary tree mostly used as a material for poetry and prose rather than a record of real plant. Therefore, it is difficult to discuss what kind of tree species this refers to. Despite the fact, this study would like to clarify the true nature of ‘Kesu’ because it has been confirmed that the name ‘Kesu’ found in Korea’s ancient literatures refers to a specific plant.  In particular, trees that grew in the Mt. Geumgangsan area were referred to as ‘Kesu’, which means that the name is related to the distribution of plants growing in a certain area or the dialect of the area. Confirmation of this fact lead to the decision that study on ‘Kesu’ appearing in Korea’s ancient literatures should be proceeded.  In this study, the symbolic meaning of ‘Kesu’ used in Korean poetry will be briefly examined first, and then information on ‘Kesu’ in the area of Mt. Geumgangsan will be discussed. Grasping these factors should enable us to have general understanding of the classical plant name of ‘Kesu’, and may provide a clue to distinguish between the ‘Kesu’ of a symbolic meaning and the ‘Cassia’ in real existence."

Since then, there has been a series of a decision on the evidence, including the exclusionary rule, the fruits of poisonous tree doctrine, and the circumstance that would give exceptionally the admissibility of secondary evidence.   In addition, there were a number of decisions that required to be prepared in compliance with the due process and proper methods in giving the admissibility of evidence in relation to the protocol, etc. prepared by prosecutor or senior judicial police officer.   As a whole, due to the influence of making a stipulation of the exclusion of evidence illegally obtained, it is clear that the case law in the field of evidence law is proceeding in a direction to emphasize the guarantee of the due process.   And in accordance with the provision of Article 314(Exception to Admissibility of Evidence) or 316(Statement of Hearsay) (2), in the case of Article 312 or 313, if a person who is required to make a statement at a preparatory hearing or a trial is unable to make such statement, which is impossible to exercise the right of cross–examination, the relevant protocol and other documents shall be admissible as evidence: Provided, that this shall apply only when it is proved that the statement or preparation was made in a particularly reliable state. In relation to the above provisions, court’s decision maintains a more rigorous interpretation as a requirement for admissibility of hearsay evidence.   In addition, court’s decision seems to be proceeding to apply strictly requirements for admissibility of evidence of documents or output from the digital storage media, explaining the requirements of seizure and search of digital storage media in response to overall scientific and information– oriented society.   And the recent decision describes the problem of establishing the judgment criteria of scientific evidence as a solution to the problem of misuse of science among the problems in the process of interaction between science and law in accordance with the criminal case.

Strieff(2016) 판결에서, 위법수집증거배제법칙은 이 원칙을 적용함으로써 얻게 되는 이익이 비용을 초과할 경우에만 정당화된다는 전제 하에, 경찰의 불법검문 중에 컴퓨터조회를 통하여 이미 체포영장이 발부된 사실을 발견하였을 경우는, 시간적 근접성, 영장발부사실 발견에 대한 예견가능성, 위법행위의 명백성 등을 고려할 때, 체포현장에서의 압수물과 공무원의 위법행위의 불법성은 이미 발부된 영장의 존재로 인하여 희석되므로 압수물은 증거로서 허용된다고 판시하였다. 그리고 Rodriguez v. United States(2015)에서는, 경찰의 자동차 검문시에는 예컨대 티켓 발부, 도로교통의 안전, 제한된 범위에서의 경찰관의 안전 등과 같이 검문의 목적과 밀접한 범위 내에서만 허용되는 것이고, 마약탐지견을 이용한 수색은 이러한 범위를 벗어나는 것이라고 판단하였다. 또한 United States v. Jones(2012) 판결은 만장일치로, 경찰이 정보수집을 목적으로 개인의 차량에 GPS를 설치하여 추적 감시하는 행위는 프라이버시를 침해하는 수색에 해당한다고 보았다. 그러나 결론에 이르는 근거에 있어서는 대법관들의 의견이 나뉘었고, 앞으로 영장이 요구되는 경우는 어떠한 경우인지, “합리적 의심”의 기준은 너무 부담스러운 것인지, 또는 국가안보와 긴급한 상황의 경우에는 법집행기관의 재량을 허용될 수 있는 것인지 등의 많은 법적 쟁점들에 관한 질문을 남기게 되었다. 오늘날의 첨단 디지털 시대를 맞아, 이메일 계정, 컴퓨터상에 저장된 정보데이터베이스, 휴대폰 사용내역, 은행계좌 거래내역 등은 범죄 탐지, 소추를 위한 수사기관의 막강한 수단으로 기능하게 되었다. 이러한 상황에서, 미연방대법원의 판례에서 제3자이론 대신에 등장하는 모자이크이론 등을 통하여 알 수 있듯이, 적법절차의 요건으로서 검문이나 압수·수색 등에 있어서 허용될 수 있는 시간과 범위 등의 요건 심사를 통하여 엄격한 법집행을 요구하고, 법관의 영장발부를 요건화 하여 사법통제를 통한 경찰의 자의적인 법집행과 남용을 방지하기 위한 노력이 요청되고 있다. 그리고 어느 범위에서 모자이크이론을 적용하는 것이 삼권분립의 원리나 수사기관과 국민 간의 충돌하는 이익의 조화로운 균형을 이룰 수 있을 것인지는 끊임없이 탐구되고 분석되어야 할 과제임이 분명할 것이다.","Since the early 20th century, the U.S. Supreme Court has applied the exclusionary rule to protect people`s right against illegal search and seizure. Also, the fruit of poisonous tree doctrine and its exceptions such as the independent source doctrine, the inevitable discovery doctrine, the attenuation doctrine, and the good faith exception have been developed, along with the legal concepts of “resonable expectation of privacy”, “probable cause”, and “reasonable suspicion.” Recently, in Utah v. Strieff (2016), U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the discovery of an outstanding arrest warrant during an illegal traffic stop attenuates the taint of the illegal police conduct and that the evidence seized in a search incident to arrest is admissible considering the short time period, the foreseeability of discovering the arrest warrant, and the potential for flagrancy. In Rodriguez v. United States (2015), the U.S. Supreme Court narrowly and concretely defined the reasonable durational scope for a traffic stop, which should be measured by police tasks closely tied to the original reason or mission for the stop: writing a ticket, related roadway safety concerns, and a limited category of officer safety concerns, and not by other crime-detection activities such as canine sniffs unrelated to the original stop. In United States v. Jones (2012), US Supreme Court ruled that the governmetn`s trespass in installing a GPS device on a vehicle for the purpose of obtaining information constituted a Fourth Amendment “search.” However, the decision resulted in three separate opinions applying vastly different rationales and raised significant issues for future consideration, such as whether a search warrant is required, whether a reasonable suspicion standard is too onerous, or whether executive discretion is agreeable with regard to national security or other exigent exceptions. In the modern era of information and telecommunication technology, the mosaic theory, not the third party theory, would contribute to restoring a reasonable balance between the individual`s interest in privacy and the interest of law enforcement in detecting and prosecuting crimes. The mosaic theory imposes limits on deployment and the use of Big Data and digital surveillance technology that make collecting and aggregating large quantity of personal information possible. The purpose of the exclusionary rule and the court`s role in the constitutional protection of privacy in the course of criminal investigation are imperative and should not be underestimated."

Without such power, contracting parties do not have incentives to comply with contract. Consequently, transaction costs would surge and social welfare would be reduced.Nonetheless, voting agreements in Korea among shareholders have surprisingly weak binding power. According to a handful number of lower court decisions, specific performance nor injunction for voting agreements are not granted. This means that the non-breaching party would have to wait years until the judgment on specific performance becomes final and conclusive. Taking into account that timing matters critically in contexts where voting agreements are made, this is not different from excluding specific performance and injunction as a remedy for voting agreements.In this paper, the relationship between the binding power of contract and efficiency is introduced in II. Calebresi and Melamed's and Ulen's precedent researches on remedies for entitlements and contracts are reviewed in Ⅲ. In Ⅳ, that binding agreements are made in closed corporations with high volatility of corporation value is noted, and that under such situation, specific performance and injunction are more efficient remedies compared with expectation damages is shown through two approaches: one of transaction cost and the other regarding game-tree-like expression. It is concluded that the binding power of voting agreements in Korea is excessively weak, resulting in great increase of transaction costs.In conclusion, this paper argues that specific performance and injunction should be explicitly allowed as a remedy for voting agreements among shareholders in Korea. Moreover, the essential function of contract law is again reviewed from a law and economics perspective, and a novel research method called ""game-tree-like expression"" is suggested."

There are various techniques such as neural networks, association rules, decision trees, and cluster analysis. In this paper, we propose a measure applying a J measure called cross entropy among the objective interest measures used in association rule mining. When the association rule is created, it is judged whether or not the association rule is generated by the size of confidence. When the position of the item is changed, the confidence degree is changed. Therefore, if the difference of two confidence values is large, it is difficult to judge which one to decide whether to generate association rules based on which one. To solve this problem, we propose a modified symmetric J measure. We also use examples to explore the usefulness of this measure through comparison with existing measures related to J measures."

By this time, both Korean and Japanese Government had commonly approved that the matter of Sakhalin Koreans were laid beyond the scope of application of the Agreement. The Japanese Government abruptly reversed its attitude and the Korean government, maintained conventional attitude, not taken any diplomatic action against Japan.Meanwhile, the Constitutional Court of Korea upheld, in the cases concerning comfort women and explosion-affected people, in 2011, that theomission that Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not protested according to the article 3 of the Agreement is unconstitutional. The article 3 provides that any dispute concerning the interpretation or the implement of this Agreement shall be settled primarily through diplomatic channels and any dispute which cannot be settled through diplomatic channel shall be submitted for decision to an arbitral commission of three arbitrator.As the Constitutional Court of Korea upheld the omission unconstitutional, the plaintiffs of the case of reimbursement claim for the postal savings withdrew it. They considered that these decisions of the Constitutional Courtshould be the same to the case of Sakhalin Koreans and then, if the Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs would proceed to the diplomatic channel to settle this dispute, the case in Japan would be meaningless.Afterwards Korean government requested Japanese government to hold the diplomatic channel, but Japanese government refused by non-response policy. In this circumstance, a claim for compensation was filed to the Seoul Central District Court for the reason why Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs have violated the obligation to proceed the next step to submit the dispute to the arbitral commission.

Using previously reported data and mumps-related cases in our hospital, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of routine mumps vaccination in Japan with a static model using current epidemiologic data.Materials and Methods: With a decision tree flowchart of mumps infection and adverse events, we estimated the burden of mumps-related complications in our hospital for 5 years, and calculated the current annual national burden. Finally, we compared the current burden and assumptive burden of the stable state after routine vaccination in Japan using a static model.Results: The cost-benefit ratios with sensitivity analysis were 3.69 (1.08-9.52) and 6.84 (1.51-23.73) in independent inoculation and simultaneous inoculation, respectively, from a social perspective in addition to an annual gain of 9,487 (3,227-14,659) quality adjusted life years.Conclusion: We contributed additional evidence in terms of cost-effectiveness that routine mumps vaccination should be introduced in Japan with simultaneous inoculation."

This study used machine learning such as decision tree, bagging, and random forest models for the function development and data of public facility damages which can be obtained from annual reports for natural disaster damages published in Korea as a dependent variable. Also, meteorological factors and socio-economic factors were considered as explanatory variables then the prediction functions were developed. As a result of comparing the amount of actual heavy rain damages with the amount of predicted damages, the NRMSE(Normalized Root Mean Squared Error) was in the range of 22.93~24.16%. The function using the bagging method showed the best prediction performance. If the predicted damages by the developed functions are used for disaster prevention and preparation, it will be a great help to reduce heavy rain damage."
기계학습을 이용한 돈사 급수량 예측방안 개발,2017,,,"Recently, accumulation of data on pig farm is enabled through the wide spread of smart pig farm equipped with Internet-of-Things based sensors, and various machine learning algorithms are applied on the data in order to improve the productivity of pig farm. Herein, multiple machine learning schemes are used to predict the water usage in pig farm which is known to be one of the most important element in pig farm management. Especially, regression algorithms, which are linear regression, regression tree and AdaBoost regression, and classification algorithms which are logistic classification, decision tree and support vector machine, are applied to derive a prediction scheme which forecast the water usage based on the temperature and humidity of pig farm. Through performance evaluation, we find that the water usage can be predicted with high accuracy. The proposed scheme can be used to detect the malfunction of water system which prevents the death of pigs and reduces the loss of pig farm."

It is a technique to determine the relationship between items in a transaction by various association evaluation criteria. Generally, it is judged whether or not the association rule is generated by the value of confidence among items having the value of lift of 1 or more and exceeding the minimum support by the user. In this case, it is difficult to judge reasonably whether or not the association rule is satisfied when the value of confidence varies depending on the position of the items. To solve this problem, we proposed a symmetric J measure that can replace the elementary association threshold among the entropy-based measures used in the decision tree method of data mining. While the existing J measure presents the degree of association between the two items in only one direction, the symmetric J measure is a measure that simultaneously considers the strength of the association in both directions, so that the magnitude of the value is larger than the measure. In particular, we have confirmed through examples that we may generate incorrect association rules if the sizes of J measures are significantly different when the positions of items are changed."

The proposed system maintains the face images of celebrities with known personal colors, and the personal color of an user is determined by applying the diagnosis model based on the personal color data of celebrities. In this paper, the diagnosis model for the proposed system is constructed by applying the conventional classification techniques such as decision tree, nearest neighbor classifier and naive Bayesian classifier to the face image data of 100 celebrities, and the consequent model is applied to 20 female undergraduates with known personal color identified through visiting professional consultants. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed system has the promising diagnosis ability so that it can replace the human experts. Moreover, it is expected that the system not only allows the individuals to identify their personal color conveniently, but also enables advanced services based on personal color."

전통적 IPA(Importance-Performance Analysis)와 수정된 IPA의 비교연구; 순천만 습지를 대상으로,2017,['-'],,"Compared to the traditional format, the revised IPA is an effective method for selecting a management strategy as compared to the traditional IPA. Comparison between the traditional IPA and revised IPA with a management strategy has been, however, limited. Therefore, the difference between the traditional IPA and revised IPA was compared to select an effective management strategy in the Suncheon Bay Wetland Reserve. First of all, related papers were reviewed to select an appropriate revised IPA. It was found that Deng (2007)'s revised IPA was appropriate for quantifying service quality and a management strategy that affects the measurable satisfaction of visitors in the space. Second, the results of the traditional IPA were compared with the revised IPA in the Suncheon Bay Wetland Reserve and the management strategy of the revised IPA and the changes of management factors were discussed. It was found that some management factors deviated from the order of the quadrant ""low priority for managers"", ""Concentrate management here"", ""Keep up the good work"" were moved to the order of the quadrants ""Concentrate management here"", ""low priority for managers"" and ""Possible overkill"" in the revised IPA grid. The complexity as a management factor resulted in higher demand management than the traditional IPA, which moved from ""low priority for managers"" to ""Concentrate management here"". Management factors resulted in lower demand management than the traditional IPA moved from ""Concentrate management here"" to ""low priority for managers""; these consisted of shade trees, exhibition exteriors, programs, and a guided tour. Also, management factors moved from ""Keep up the good work"" to ""Possible overkill"" consisted of relaxation facilities, glow of the setting sun, a hedge, and an exhibition interior. Over all, the revised IPA responded properly to changes in the measurable satisfaction of visitors to the Suncheon Bay Wetland Reserve. Therefore, a revised IPA should be provided for accurate and reliable guidelines when decision makers establish management strategies."

In this paper, we analyze the components of a simulation system to reversely model the radar threats that emit electromagnetic signals based on the parameters of the electronic information, and propose a method to gradually maintain the reverse extrapolation model of RF threats. In the experiment, we will evaluate the effectiveness of the incremental model update and also assess the integration method of reverse extrapolation models. The individual model of RF threats are constructed by using decision tree, naive Bayesian classifier, artificial neural network, and clustering algorithms through Euclidean distance and cosine similarity measurement, respectively. Experimental results show that the accuracy of reverse extrapolation models improves, while the size of the threat sample increases. In addition, we use voting, weighted voting, and the Dempster-Shafer algorithm to integrate the results of the five different models of RF threats. As a result, the final decision of reverse extrapolation through the Dempster-Shafer algorithm shows the best performance in its accuracy."

Bag-of-concepts: Comprehending document representation through clustering words in distributed representation,2017,"['Bag-of-concepts', 'Interpretable document representation', 'Word2vec clustering']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Two document representation methods are mainly used in solving text mining problems. Known for its intuitive and simple interpretability, the bag-of-words method represents a document vector by its word frequencies. However, this method suffers from the curse of dimensionality, and fails to preserve accurate proximity information when the number of unique words increases. Furthermore, this method assumes every word to be independent, disregarding the impact of semantically similar words on preserving document proximity. On the other hand, doc2vec, a basic neural network model, creates low dimensional vectors that successfully preserve the proximity information. However, it loses the interpretability as meanings behind each feature are indescribable. This paper proposes the bag-of-concepts method as an alternative document representation method that overcomes the weaknesses of these two methods. This proposed method creates concepts through clustering word vectors generated from word2vec, and uses the frequencies of these concept clusters to represent document vectors. Through these data-driven concepts, the proposed method incorporates the impact of semantically similar words on preserving document proximity effectively. With appropriate weighting scheme such as concept frequency-inverse document frequency, the proposed method provides better document representation than previously suggested methods, and also offers intuitive interpretability behind the generated document vectors. Based on the proposed method, subsequently constructed text mining models, such as decision tree, can also provide interpretable and intuitive reasons on why certain collections of documents are different from others.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  Document vectors are represented as the bag of concepts. </LI> <LI>  Concepts are created by clustering term vectors generated from word2vec. </LI> <LI>  The proposed method shows superior representational performance. </LI> <LI>  Document vectors generated from the proposed method have interpretable features. </LI> <LI>  Operating logic behind subsequently created text mining models can be comprehended. </LI> </UL> </P>"

Bible says God gave the rule of forbidding the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Human, however, disobeyed the rule. For Israelite spirituality, God gave several rules about diet in their lives which related to their spirit. We need to recognize the connection between food and faith in the Bible and also in our daily life.  For spiritual education in daily life through meal, I propose three suggestions. First is the gratitude and humility on life through recognition of meal(Jingi) and reflection on ingredient in food. Next is about preparing the meal table of life. For this, seasonal food and local food are needed in our daily table. There is also the responsibility for seeking safe food ingredient. Lastly, there is eating responsibly. Wendell Berry points out behavior of eating is like an agricultural act. It emphasizes the responsibility in eating. Sharing food is also connected to sharing life in Jesus’ ministry and today. Moreover ecological mind in eating is decisive for sustaining earth."
Movie Popularity Classification Based on Support Vector Machine Combined with Social Network Analysis,2017,"['Movie Popularity Classification', 'Social Network Analysis', 'Movie Popularity', 'SVM']",,"The rapid growth of information technology and mobile service platforms, i.e., internet, google, and facebook, etc.has led the abundance of data. Due to this environment, the world is now facing a revolution in the process that data is searched, collected, stored, and shared. Abundance of data gives us several opportunities to knowledge discovery and data mining techniques. In recent years, data mining methods as a solution to discovery and extraction of available knowledge in database has been more popular in e-commerce service fields such as, in particular, movie recommendation. However, most of the classification approaches for predicting the movie popularity have used only several types of information of the movie such as actor, director, rating score, language and countries etc.In this study, we propose a classification-based support vector machine (SVM) model for predicting the movie popularity based on movie’s genre data and social network data. Social network analysis (SNA) is used for improving the classification accuracy. This study builds the movies’ network (one mode network) based on initial data which is a two mode network as user-to-movie network. For the proposed method we computed degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality as centrality measures in movie’s network. Those four centrality values and movies’ genre data were used to classify the movie popularity in this study. The logistic regression, neural network, naïve Bayes classifier, and decision tree as benchmarking models for movie popularity classification were also used for comparison with the performance of our proposed model. To assess the classifier’s performance accuracy this study used MovieLens data as an open database. Our empirical results indicate that our proposed model with movie’s genre and centrality data has by approximately 0% higher accuracy than other classification models with only movie’s genre data. The implications of our results show that our proposed model can be used for improving movie popularity classification accuracy."

So far many steelmakers generally have used visual inspection method that could be based on an inspectors intuition or experience. Specifically, the inspector checks the steel plate faults by looking the surface of the steel plates. However, the accuracy of this method is critically low that it can cause errors above 30% in judgment. Therefore, accurate steel plate faults diagnosis system has been continuously required in the industry. In order to meet the needs, this study proposed a new steel plate faults diagnosis system using Simultaneous MTS (S-MTS), which is an advanced Mahalanobis Taguchi System (MTS) algorithm, to classify various surface defects of the steel plates. MTS has generally been used to solve binary classification problems in various fields, but MTS was not used for multiclass classification due to its low accuracy. The reason is that only one mahalanobis space is established in the MTS. In contrast, S-MTS is suitable for multi-class classification. That is, S-MTS establishes individual mahalanobis space for each class. Simultaneous implies comparing mahalanobis distances at the same time. The proposed steel plate faults diagnosis system was developed in four main stages. In the first stage, after various reference groups and related variables are defined, data of the steel plate faults is collected and used to establish the individual mahalanobis space per the reference groups and construct the full measurement scale. In the second stage, the mahalanobis distances of test groups is calculated based on the established mahalanobis spaces of the reference groups. Then, appropriateness of the spaces is verified by examining the separability of the mahalanobis diatances. In the third stage, orthogonal arrays and Signal-to-Noise (SN) ratio of dynamic type are applied for variable optimization. Also, Overall SN ratio gain is derived from the SN ratio and SN ratio gain. If the derived overall SN ratio gain is negative, it means that the variable should be removed. However, the variable with the positive gain may be considered as worth keeping. Finally, in the fourth stage, the measurement scale that is composed of selected useful variables is reconstructed. Next, an experimental test should be implemented to verify the ability of multi-class classification and thus the accuracy of the classification is acquired. If the accuracy is acceptable, this diagnosis system can be used for future applications. Also, this study compared the accuracy of the proposed steel plate faults diagnosis system with that of other popular classification algorithms including Decision Tree, Multi Perception Neural Network (MLPNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Tree Bagger Random Forest, Grid Search (GS), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The steel plates faults dataset used in the study is taken from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository. As a result, the proposed steel plate faults diagnosis system based on S-MTS shows 90.79% of classification accuracy. The accuracy of the proposed diagnosis system is 6-27% higher than MLPNN, LR, GS, GA and PSO. Based on the fact that the accuracy of commercial systems is only about 75-80%, it means that the proposed system has enough classification performance to be applied in the industry. In addition, the proposed system can reduce the number of measurement sensors that are installed in the fields because of variable optimization process. These results show that the proposed system not only can have a good ability on the steel plate faults diagnosis but also reduce operation and maintenance cost. For our future work, it will be applied in the fields to validate actual effectiveness of the proposed system and plan to improve the accuracy based on the results."

But, we can’t believe that there was such a custom of the customary rights for graves in 1927 and in 2017. The reason is there were a number of lawsuits about graves, and there were not a system of acquisitive prescription in the Joseon dynasty. As of 2017, the educational level of the citizen increased, the increase of economic value such as mountain area, the substitution and easy relocation of cemetery, the modernization of funeral facilities such as cremation and tree funeral, the rapid increase of the cremation population, the change of citizens’ perceptions of cemetery caused by the decline of Confucianism culture and the expansion of Christianity and Buddhist culture, low cost of cremation etc also bring on a change in perception of burial customs. In addition, the Act on Funeral enacted on January 13, 2001 shows legitimate decision of non permission about the customary rights for graves no more.

We analyze the employment status of 9,631 university graduates of each year in a three-year-period(2014∼2016). The employment outcomes of university graduates are divided into two groups, employed and unemployed, and selected 15 determinants are classified into socioeconomic factors, school life factors, and employment preparation factors based on previous studies. We use logistic regression and decision tree method for the analysis. The major results of this study are the following: First, as a result of analyzing the current status of employment, we find that the employment rates by major are the highest in engineering department, social department, humanities department, education department, arts and physical department, natural department in order. Employment rates are high if a graduate belongs to categories of Male, New entrance, Within-entrance, School record scholarship recipients, Exchange student, Economics & business double major, Not exceeded registration, Internship, Participation in employment support program. Employment rate differentials are not significant if a graduate belongs to categories of Recruitment classification, High school area, High school classification, Total double major. Second, as a result of the hypothesis test, we find that there was a difference in employment outcomes by major. Gender(male students), admission classification(new entrance students) have positive effects on the employment outcomes in relation to socioeconomic factors. In terms of school life factors, the higher the graduation average score, the higher the job performance. we find that the case of students who went to exchange students and the case of economics and business double major have positive effects on the employment outcomes, but the registration of the excess semester has a negative effect on the employment outcomes. The experiences of internship experience and participation in job support program have positive effects on the employment outcomes. Third, influences of Internship status, Participation in employment support program, Major, Economic & business double major, Gender and Admission classification in employment decision were found to be significant. Factors that can be controlled by individual efforts, such as Internship status, Participation in employment support programs, and whether they are engaged in Economic & business double major, are found to be more influential than those that are difficult to be improved at the individual level such as Major, Gender, and Admission classification. This study examines the major determinants of employment which have been merely understood with intuitional grounds, by providing empirical analysis on official data in the administrative system of University A. Based on its results, we suggest that various and useful student-tailored employment guidelines be set up at the university level in order to improve university outcomes in employment of its graduates."

기계학습 방법에 기반 한 불균형 침입탐지 데이터 분류법의 성능평가에 관한 연구,2017,"['침입탐지', '기계학습', '데이터 전처리', '희소 클래스', 'IDS', 'Machine Learning', 'Data Preprocessing', 'Rare Class']","본 논문에서는 침입탐지 데이터셋을 사용하여 이상 행위를 탐지하고 데이터 전처리 과정의 효율성을 높이기 위해 훈련 데이터의 클래스 비율을 조절한다. 제안 방법의 성능을 입증하기 위해 머신러닝 알고리즘들을 사용하여 비교 실험을 한다. 일반적으로 머신러닝을 기반으로 한 분류 알고리즘을 적용할 때 클래스의 크기는 분류에 많은 영향을 끼친다. 주요 클래스 크기가 희소 클래스에 비해 많이 큰 경우에는 주요 클래스로만 분류되는 경향이 있다. 희소 클래스의 비율이 최소 0.5% 이상 되도록 유지하고, 희소 클래스의 분류 효율을 높일 수 있는 적절한 비율을 찾고자 한다. 기존 데이터에 랜덤성을 부여하여 희소 클래스들의 수를 증가시키는 SMOTE (Synthetic Miniority Over-sampling TEchnique) 기법을 사용한다. 실험에 사용한 KDD CUP 1999 데이터셋은 R2L과 U2R 공격 유형에 해당하는 클래스의 수가 매우 적어서 높은 분류 효율을 내기 어려운 점이 있다. 본 연구에서는 여러 클래스들 간의 관계 및 분포를 분석한 후, 주요 클래스와 희소 클래스의 비중을 조절하는 방법을 사용하여 분류 효율을 개선하였다. 특히, 희소 클래스의 탐지 여부에 높은 비중을 두면서 전체적인 분류 성능을 개선하고자 하였다. 훈련 데이터셋의 희소 클래스인 U2R, R2L 및 Probe를 각각 120배, 9배, 1.5배 증가시킨 recall 실험 결과에서, k-NN 실험에 대해 U2R 클래스의 경우 0.11, R2L 클래스의 경우 0.02의 성능 향상을 보였다. SVM 실험에서 U2R 클래스의 경우 0.02, R2L 클래스의 경우 0.08의 성능 향상을 보였으며, 의사결정트리 실험에서는 U2R 클래스의 경우에 0.25의성 능 향상을 보였다.","In this paper, we adjusted the class distribution of train data to increase efficiency in data pre-processing and detect anomalies in an intrusion detection dataset. We conduct an experiment with machine learning algorithms to prove the efficiency of our proposed methods. In general, when using machine learning algorithms, volume of class influences on the results of classification. When the volume of majority classes is larger than that of minority classes, most of samples tend to vote the majority class. We hold the proportion of each rare class to be 0.5% at least, and try to find the proper proportion of rare classes. SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique) was used to increase the number of instances of rare class. It is difficult to improve the efficiency of classification because KDD CUP 1999 dataset, which are used to our tests, have rare classes such as R2L and U2R. In our research, we analyze various classes and enhance the efficiency of clasfsiciation by adjusting the volume of rare classes. We attempt tiomprove the performance of classification focusing on the rare classes such as U2R, R2L and Probe. The number of instances of U2R, R2L and Probe class in the train data was increased by 12-fold, 9-fol da,nd 1.5 fold, respectively. Recall metrics okf -NN tests went up to 0.11 in U2R class and 0.02 in R2L class. Recall metrics of SVM tests went up to 0.02 in U2R class and 0.08 in R2L class, and those of decision tree tests went up to 0.25."
