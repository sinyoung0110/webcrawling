Plurality Rule–based Density and Correlation Coefficient–based Clustering for K-NN,2017,"['Classification', 'Density-based', 'K-NN', 'DPC-KNN-PCA', 'Processing time']",,"k-nearest neighbor (K-NN) is a well-known classification algorithm, being feature space–based on nearest-neighbor training examples in machine learning. However, K-NN, as we know, is a lazy learning method. Therefore, if a K-NN–based system very much depends on a huge amount of history data to achieve an accurate prediction result for a particular task, it gradually faces a processing-time performance-degradation problem. We have noticed that many researchers usually contemplate only classification accuracy. But estimation speed also plays an essential role in realtime prediction systems. To compensate for this weakness, this paper proposes correlation coefficient–based clustering (CCC) aimed at upgrading the performance of K-NN by leveraging processing-time speed and plurality rule–based density (PRD) to improve estimation accuracy. For experiments, we used real datasets (on breast cancer, breast tissue, heart, and the iris) from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository. Moreover, real traffic data collected from Ojana Junction, Route 58, Okinawa, Japan, was also utilized to lay bare the efficiency of this method. By using these datasets, we proved better processing-time performance with the new approach by comparing it with classical K-NN. Besides, via experiments on realworld datasets, we compared the prediction accuracy of our approach with density peaks clustering based on K-NN and principal component analysis (DPC-KNN-PCA)."
Management-Reserve Estimation for International Construction Projects Based on Risk-Informed k-NN,2017,,,"<P>International construction projects normally involve high levels of risk. To reduce such risk, contractors typically include a reserve to mitigate cost overruns and schedule delays. This reserve comprises two categories: (1)a contingency reserve covering potentially required changes, and (2) a management reserve (MR) covering unplanned changes. Since estimating an MR is difficult because the inherent risks are unpredictable, the traditional percentage method is still used for this purpose. To address this shortcoming, this study proposes an MR estimation method based on the cost and schedule performance ratios of international construction projects. K-nearest neighbor (k-NN) is applied to retrieve similar projects and a genetic algorithm is adopted to optimize the retrieved cases. Finally, case studies are conducted to validate the estimated ratios and test the applicability of the proposed MR estimation method. The case study results show that the proposed method can infer the cost and schedule performance ratios within a 5% error rate. As a result, it can estimate the MR more accurately than the traditional percentage method. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.</P>"

Recently, some location based social applications that combine social services and location based services have been emerged. The demands of a k-nearest neighbors(k-NN) query which finds k closest locations from a user location are increased in the location based social network services. In this paper, we propose an approximate k-NN query processing method for fast response time in a large number of users environments. The proposed method performs efficient stream processing using big data distributed processing technologies. In this paper, we also propose a modified grid index method for indexing a large amount of location data. The proposed query processing method first retrieves the related cells by considering a user movement. By doing so, it can make an approximate k results set.

An Approach of Dimension Reduction in k-Nearest Neighbor Based Short-term Load Forecasting,2017,"['Load Forecasting', 'k-Nearest Neighbor', 'Dimension Reduction']",,"The k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm is one of the most widely used benchmark algorithm in classification. Nowadays it has been further applied to predict time series. However, one of the main concerns of the algorithm applied on short-term electricity load forecasting is high computational burden. In the paper, we propose an approach of dimension reduction that follows the principles of highlighting the temperature effect on electricity load data series. The results show the proposed approach is able to reduce the dimension of the data around 30%. Moreover, with temperature effect highlighting, the approach will contribute to finding similar days accurately, and then raise forecasting accuracy slightly."

Dual-kNN for a Pattern Classification Approach,2017,"['Dual-kNN', 'kNN', 'Robustness', 'Pattern classification']",,"Classification is a process of discovering and categorizing objects from large data storage that have similar characteristics, properties, and patterns. One of the most widely used classification methods in machine learning is the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. The unique property of k-NN that appeals to researchers is its simplicity, so it can be applied successfully over a wide field. However, according to measurement of the performance of an algorithm based on three considerations (simplicity, processing time, and prediction power), the k-NN algorithm lacks highspeed computation and maintenance of high accuracy for different K values. In other words, k-NN is a heuristic classification approach. Besides, the prediction accuracy fades away whenever K approaches larger values. To overcome these issues, this paper presents a dual-kNN that concentrates on two properties to keep up the accuracy at different K values and upgrade processing time performance. By conducting experiments on real datasets and comparing this algorithm with k-NN, it was also confirmed that the new dual-kNN is an effective and robust approach to classification."

Good agreement is observed between the measured v(2) and hydrodynamic calculations for all systems, and an argument disfavoring theoretical explanations based on initial momentum-space domain correlations is presented.

The data can be well described by all three generators within the detector acceptance. However, when using the generators to extrapolate to 4 pi, significant differences are observed for the total cross section. These difference are less pronounced for b (b) over bar than for c (c) over bar. The same model dependence was observed in already published d + A data.

"Measurement of the relative yields of ψ(2S) to ψ(1S) mesons produced at forward and backward rapidity in p+p , p+Al , p+Au , and He3+Au collisions at <sub>sNN</sub>=200 GeV",2017,,,"<P>The PHENIX Collaboration has measured the ratio of the yields of psi(2S) to psi(1S) mesons produced in p + p, p + Al, p + Au, and He-3+Au collisions at root S-NN = 200 GeV over the forward and backward rapidity intervals 1.2 < | y | < 2.2. We find that the ratio in p + p collisions is consistent with measurements at other collision energies. In collisions with nuclei, we find that in the forward (p-going or He-3-going) direction, the relative yield of psi(2S) mesons to psi(1S) mesons is consistent with the value measured in p + p collisions. However, in the backward (nucleus-going) direction, the psi(2S) meson is preferentially suppressed by a factor of similar to 2. This suppression is attributed in some models to the breakup of the weakly bound psi(2S) meson through final-state interactions with comoving particles, which have a higher density in the nucleus-going direction. These breakup effects may compete with color screening in a deconfined quark-gluon plasma to produce sequential suppression of excited quarkonia states.</P>"
