Feature Selection Algorithm for Intrusions Detection System using Sequential Forward Search and Random Forest Classifier,2017,"['FeatureSelection', 'SFFS', 'RandomForest', 'IDS']",,"Cyber attacks are evolving commensurate with recent developments in information security technology. Intrusion detection systems collect various types of data from computers and networks to detect security threats and analyze the attack information. The large amount of data examined make the large number of computations and low detection rates problematic. Feature selection is expected to improve the classification performance and provide faster and more cost-effective results. Despite the various feature selection studies conducted for intrusion detection systems, it is difficult to automate feature selection because it is based on the knowledge of security experts. This paper proposes a feature selection technique to overcome the performance problems of intrusion detection systems. Focusing on feature selection, the first phase of the proposed system aims at constructing a feature subset using a sequential forward floating search (SFFS) to downsize the dimension of the variables. The second phase constructs a classification model with the selected feature subset using a random forest classifier (RFC) and evaluates the classification accuracy. Experiments were conducted with the NSL-KDD dataset using SFFS-RF, and the results indicated that feature selection techniques are a necessary preprocessing step to improve the overall system performance in systems that handle large datasets. They also verified that SFFS-RF could be used for data classification. In conclusion, SFFS-RF could be the key to improving the classification model performance in machine learning."
A Variable Impacts Measurement in Random Forest for Mobile Cloud Computing,2017,,,"<P>Recently, the importance of mobile cloud computing has increased. Mobile devices can collect personal data from various sensors within a shorter period of time and sensor-based data consists of valuable information from users. Advanced computation power and data analysis technology based on cloud computing provide an opportunity to classify massive sensor data into given labels. Random forest algorithm is known as black box model which is hardly able to interpret the hidden process inside. In this paper, we propose a method that analyzes the variable impact in random forest algorithm to clarify which variable affects classification accuracy the most. We apply Shapley Value with random forest to analyze the variable impact. Under the assumption that every variable cooperates as players in the cooperative game situation, Shapley Value fairly distributes the payoff of variables. Our proposed method calculates the relative contributions of the variables within its classification process. In this paper, we analyze the influence of variables and list the priority of variables that affect classification accuracy result. Our proposed method proves its suitability for data interpretation in black box model like a random forest so that the algorithm is applicable in mobile cloud computing environment.</P>"
Biological Feature Selection and Disease Gene Identification using New Stepwise Random Forests,2017,"['Bioinformatics', 'Classification', 'Feature Evaluation and Selection', 'Modeling and Prediction']",,"Identifying disease genes from human genome is a critical task in biomedical research. Important biological features to distinguish the disease genes from the non-disease genes have been mainly selected based on traditional feature selection approaches. However, the traditional feature selection approaches unnecessarily consider many unimportant biological features. As a result, although some of the existing classification techniques have been applied to disease gene identification, the prediction performance was not satisfactory. A small set of the most important biological features can enhance the accuracy of disease gene identification, as well as provide potentially useful knowledge for biologists or clinicians, who can further investigate the selected biological features as well as the potential disease genes. In this paper, we propose a new stepwise random forests (SRF) approach for biological feature selection and disease gene identification. The SRF approach consists of two stages. In the first stage, only important biological features are iteratively selected in a forward selection manner based on one-dimensional random forest regression, where the updated residual vector is considered as the current response vector. We can then determine a small set of important biological features. In the second stage, random forests classification with regard to the selected biological features is applied to identify disease genes. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed SRF approach outperforms the existing feature selection and classification techniques in terms of biological feature selection and disease gene identification."

COSMO-SkyMed 2 Image Color Mapping Using Random Forest Regression,2017,"['Random Forest Regression', 'Color Mapping', 'Synthetic Aperture Radar', 'COSMO-SkyMed 2', 'WorldView-3']",,"SAR (Synthetic aperture radar) images are less affected by the weather compared to optical images and can be obtained at any time of the day. Therefore, SAR images are being actively utilized for military applications and natural disasters. However, because SAR data are in grayscale, it is difficult to perform visual analysis and to decipher details. In this study, we propose a color mapping method using RF (random forest) regression for enhancing the visual decipherability of SAR images. COSMO-SkyMed 2 and WorldView-3 images were obtained for the same area and RF regression was used to establish color configurations for performing color mapping. The results were compared with image fusion, a traditional color mapping method. The UIQI (universal image quality index), the SSIM (structural similarity) index, and CC (correlation coefficients) were used to evaluate the image quality. The color-mapped image based on the RF regression had a significantly higher quality than the images derived from the other methods. From the experimental result, the use of color mapping based on the RF regression for SAR images was confirmed."
A Random Forest Analysis of Can and May in Korean EFL Learners’ Writings,2017,"['EFL writings', 'corpus', 'modal', 'random forest', 'variable importance']",,"It is predictable that the uses of English modal auxiliaries by English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners differ from those by English as a Native Language (ENL) speakers. Following the studies in Deshors (2010) and Deshors & Gries (2014), Yoon and Lee (2016) adopted a corpus-based method and examined the uses of these two modal auxiliaries can and may by ENL speakers and Korean EFL learners. Utilizing the same corpus data used in Yoon and Lee (2016), this study investigates where the discrepancies were originated. This paper takes a random forest analysis and calculates the variable importance of each linguistic factor in the corpus data of each group. The analysis reveals which factors play a crucial role in the determination of alternations in each group. Through the analysis, the followings were observed: (i) Sense (deontic vs. epistemic vs. dynamic) played the most important role in the determination of can vs. may in both groups of speakers, (ii) Vendler’s classification, subject morpheme type, verb semantics, and animate type (of the subject) played essential roles in ENL speakers’ group, (iii) Subject person, subject morpheme type, animate type, and clause type played critical roles in Korean EFL learners’ group, and (iv) Korean EFL learners gave more importance to sense, subject morpheme type, animate type, and subject person whereas ENL speakers gave more importance to Vendler’s classification."

Learning-based deformable registration for infant MRI by integrating random forest with auto-context model,2017,,,"<P>Conclusions: The proposed new learning-based registration method have tackled the challenging issues in registering infant brain images acquired from the first year of life, by leveraging the multi-output random forest regression with auto-context model, which can learn the evolution of shape and appearance from a training set of longitudinal infant images. Thus, for the new infant image, its deformation field to the template and also its template-like appearances can be predicted by the learned models. We have extensively compared our method with state-of-the-art deformable registration methods, as well as multiple variants of our method, which show that our method can achieve higher accuracy even for the difficult cases with large appearance and shape changes between subject and template images.

"Influences of Forest Fire on Forest Floor and Litterfall in Bhoramdeo Wildlife Sanctuary (C.G.), India",2017,"['forest floor biomass', 'forest fire', 'litterfall', 'turnover', 'turnover time']",,"Tropical forests play a key role for functioning of the planet and maintenance of life. These  forests support more than half of the world’s species, serve as regulators of global and regional climate, act as carbon  sinks and provide valuable ecosystem services. Forest floor biomass and litterfall dynamics was measured in different  sites influenced by fire in a seasonally dry tropical forest of Bhoramdeo wildlife sanctuary of Chhattisgarh, India. The  forest floor biomass was collected randomly placed quadrats while the litterfall measured by placing stone-block lined  denuded quadrat technique. The seasonal mean total forest floor biomass across the fire regimes varied from 2.00-3.65 t  ha-1. The total litterfall of the study sites varied from 4.75-7.56 t ha-1 yr-1. Annual turnover of litter varied from 70- 74% and the turnover time between 1.35-1.43 years. Monthly pattern of forest floor biomass indicated that partially  decayed litter, wood litter and total forest floor were differed significantly. The seasonal variation showed that leaf  fall differed significantly in winter season only among the fire regimes while the wood litter was found non significant  in all the season. This study shows that significant variation among the site due to the forest fire. Decomposition is  one of the ecological processes critical to the functioning of forest ecosystems. The decomposing wood serves  as a saving account of nutrients and organic materials in the forest floor. Across the site, high fire zone was facing much of  the deleterious effects on forest floor biomass and litter production. Control on such type of wildfire and  anthropogenic ignition could allow the natural recovery processes to enhance biological diversity. Chronic disturbances do not  provide time for ecosystem recovery; it needs to be reduced for ecosystem health and maintaining of the high floral and  faunal biodiversity."

Effects of wind and tree density on forest fire patterns in a mixed-tree species forest,2017,"['Forest ﬁre', 'fractal dimension', 'Moranʼs I', 'stochastic cellular automata model']",,"It is well known that global climate change causes an increase in forest ﬁre frequency and severity. Thus, understanding ﬁre dynamics is necessary to comprehend the mitigation of the negative effects of forest ﬁres. Our objective was to inform how ﬁre spreads in a simulated two-species forest with varying wind strengths. The forest in this study was comprised of two different tree species with varying probabilities of transferring ﬁre that was randomly distributed in space at densities (Ctot) ranging from 0.0 (low) to 1.0 (high). We studied the distribution pattern of burnt trees by using local rules of the two-dimensional model. This model incorporated wind blowing from south to north with strength (Pw) ranging from 0.0 (low) to 1.0 (high). Simulation results showed that when Ctot > 0.45 the ﬁre covered the entire forest, but when Ctot  0.45 the ﬁre did not spread. The wind effect on the variation of the amount of the burnt tree was maximized at the critical density and dramatically decreased with increasing Ctot. Additionally, we found that the term of Ctot and Pw plays an important role in determining the distribution."

"Spatial distribution patterns of old-growth forest of dioecious tree Torreya nucifera in rocky Gotjawal terrain of Jeju Island, South Korea",2017,"['Dioecy', 'Gotjawal terrain', 'Spatial pattern', 'Spatial segregation of sexes', 'Torreya nucifera']",,"Background: Spatial structure of plants in a population reflects complex interactions of ecological and evolutionary processes. For dioecious plants, differences in reproduction cost between sexes and sizes might affect their spatial distribution. Abiotic heterogeneity may also affect adaptation activities, and result in a unique spatial structure of the population. Thus, we examined sex- and size-related spatial distributions of old-growth forest of dioecious tree Torreya nucifera in extremely heterogeneous Gotjawal terrain of Jeju Island, South Korea.Methods: We generated a database of location, sex, and size (DBH) of T. nucifera trees for each quadrat (160 × 300 m) in each of the three sites previously defined (quadrat A, B, C in Site I, II, and III, respectively). T. nucifera trees were categorized into eight groups based on sex (males vs. females), size (small vs. large trees), and sex by size (small vs.large males, and small vs. large females) for spatial point pattern analysis. Univariate and bivariate spatial analyses were conducted.Results: Univariate spatial analysis showed that spatial patterns of T. nucifera trees differed among the three quadrats.In quadrat A, individual trees showed random distribution at all scales regardless of sex and size groups. When assessing univariate patterns for sex by size groups in quadrat B, small males and small females were distributed randomly at all scales whereas large males and large females were clumped. All groups in quadrat C were clustered at short distances but the pattern changed as distance was increased. Bivariate spatial analyses testing the association between sex and size groups showed that spatial segregation occurred only in quadrat C. Males and females were spatially independent at all scales. However, after controlling for size, males and females were spatially separated.Conclusions: Diverse spatial patterns of T. nucifera trees across the three sites within the Torreya Forest imply that adaptive explanations are not sufficient for understanding spatial structure in this old-growth forest. If so, the role of Gotjawal terrain in terms of creating extremely diverse microhabitats and subsequently stochastic processes of survival and mortality of trees, both of which ultimately determine spatial patterns, needs to be further examined."

Adaptive Prediction Method Based on Alternating Decision Forests with Considerations for Generalization Ability,2017,"['Data Mining', 'Big Data', 'Prediction Model', 'Random Forests', 'Alternating Decision Forests']",,"Many machine learning algorithms have been proposed and applied to a wide range of prediction problems in the field of industrial management. Lately, the amount of data is increasing and machine learning algorithms with low computational costs and efficient ensemble methods are needed. Alternating Decision Forest (ADF) is an efficient ensemble method known for its high performance and low computational costs. ADFs introduce weights representing the degree of prediction accuracy for each piece of training data and randomly select attribute variables for each node. This method can effectively construct an ensemble model that can predict training data accurately while allowing each decision tree to retain different features. However, outliers can cause overfitting, and since candidates of branch conditions vary for nodes in ADFs, there is a possibility that prediction accuracy will deteriorate because the fitness of training data is highly restrained. In order to improve prediction accuracy, we focus on the prediction results for new data. That is to say, we introduce bootstrap sampling so that the algorithm can generate out-of-bag (OOB) datasets for each tree in the training phase. Additionally, we construct an effective ensemble of decision trees to improve generalization ability by considering the prediction accuracy for OOB data. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct simulation experiments using the UCI machine learning repository.

"Developing the site index equation using a generalized algebraic difference approach for Pinus densiflora in central region, Korea",2017,"['Algebraic difference approach', 'base-ageinvariant', 'Chapman-Richards model', 'Pinus densiﬂora', 'site index']",,"The purpose of this study was to present practical approaches for developing site index equations and compare the results to those obtained from a generalized algebraic difference approach. Traditional estimation techniques for dominant height equations involve the random choice of observed growth intervals and base ages, where each combination results in a different set of parameter estimates. The traditional methods were affected by the choice of base age and measurement intervals. The baseage-invariant techniques produced identical results regardless of the choice of base ages or applied algorithm. The Chapman-Richards model was used in this study to develop site index equations for Pinus densiﬂora in the central region, Korea. The algebraic difference approach was used to derive an anamorphic base-age invariant site function that ﬁt as aﬁxed base-age anamorphic site function (base age = 30 years). The developed site index equations apply to central region Pinus densiﬂora plantations ranging in age from 3 to 50 years. The new site functions represent an improvement over earlier site functions because the new method accounted for serial correlation in the data."

The treatments consisted of two pure planting plots (100% A and 100% G) and five mixed planting plots (50%A: 50%G, 35%A: 65%G, 25%A: 75%G, 65%A: 35%G and 75%A: 25%G) of these two species. In nursery, seedlings were raised in a randomized blocks with four replicates of seven treatment plots. Periodic increments on height (cm), collar diameter (cm) and leaf/phyllode number of the seedlings was taken in every month and continued up to 10 months. The growth and biomass yield of seedlings were measured 10 months after the first seed was emerged. The effects of mixed plantation on growth and biomass were compared to that of seedlings grown in pure plantation. At the age of 10 months it was found that G. arborea seedlings were significantly tallest (240.13 cm) when planted with A. auriculiformis in a proportion of 25%A: 75%G, whereas A. auriculiformis were tallest in the pure 100% A plot, with an average mean height of 135.36 cm. Maximum collar diameter (1.38 cm) was recorded for G. arborea in the mixed plots 75%A: 25%G. Fresh and dry weight of shoots and roots of the seedlings were found significantly (p<0.05) highest in 50%A: 50%G plot for G. arborea. G. arborea also showed highest quality index when mixed with A. auriculiformis in a proportion of 50:50, with an average value of 8.96. The results revealed a positive correlation between seedling growth and various planting patterns."

Since the spatial distribution of heat in a city varies by region, it is crucial to investigate detailed thermal characteristics of urban areas. Recently, many studies have been conducted to identify thermal characteristics of urban areas using satellite data. However, satellite data are not sufficient for precise analysis due to the trade-off of temporal and spatial resolutions. In this study, in order to examine the thermal characteristics of Daegu Metropolitan City during the summers between 2012 and 2016, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daytime and nighttime land surface temperature (LST) data at 1 km spatial resolution were downscaled to a spatial resolution of 250 m using a machine learning method called random forest. Compared to the original 1 km LST, the downscaled 250 m LST showed a higher correlation between the proportion of impervious areas and mean land surface temperatures in Daegu by the administrative neighborhood unit. Hot spot analysis was then conducted using downscaled daytime and nighttime 250 m LST. The clustered hot spot areas for daytime and nighttime were compared and examined based on the land cover data provided by the Ministry of Environment. The high-value hot spots were relatively more clustered in industrial and commercial areas during the daytime and in residential areas at night. The thermal characterization of urban areas using the method proposed in this study is expected to contribute to the establishment of city and national security policies."

The goal of this article is to survey the landscape surrounding Bayesian decision tree methods, and to discuss recent modeling and computational developments. We provide connections between Bayesian tree-based methods and existing machine learning techniques, and outline several recent theoretical developments establishing frequentist consistency and rates of convergence for the posterior distribution. The methodology we present is applicable for a wide variety of statistical tasks including regression, classification, modeling of count data, and many others.

Most existing works focus on fusing the atlases from high-quality MR images. However, for low-quality diagnostic images (i.e., with high inter-slice thickness), the problem of atlas fusion has not been addressed yet. In this paper, we intend to fuse the brain atlas from the high-thickness diagnostic MR images that are prevalent for clinical routines. The main idea of our works is to extend the conventional groupwise registration by incorporating a novel super-resolution strategy. The contribution of the proposed super-resolution framework is two-fold. First, each high-thickness subject image is reconstructed to be isotropic by the patch-based sparsity learning. Then, the reconstructed isotropic image is enhanced for better quality through the random-forest-based regression model. In this way, the images obtained by the super-resolution strategy can be fused together by applying the groupwise registration method to construct the required atlas. Our experiments have shown that the proposed framework can effectively solve the problem of atlas fusion from the low-quality brain MR images.</P>    <P><B>Highlights</B></P> <P> <UL> <LI>  We fuse the brain atlas from real diagnostic MR images with high inter-slice thickness. </LI> <LI>  All images are processed through the two-stage learning-based super-resolution. </LI> <LI>  Groupwise registration is applied for unbiased atlas fusion. </LI> </UL> </P>"

In addition, two kinds of mini games are included in the game. The first game is a fruit catch game using motion recognition tracking of the Kinect sensor, and player have to pick up a certain number of randomly falling fruits. If a player acquire a certain number of fruits at this time, the movement speed of the player is increased. However, if a player takes a skeleton that appears randomly, the movement speed will decrease.

A novel approach is proposed in this work for depth video based human activity recognition using joint-based motion features of depth body shapes and Deep Belief Network (DBN). From depth video, different body parts of human activities are segmented first by means of a trained random forest. The motion features representing the magnitude and direction of each joint in next frame are extracted. Finally, the features are applied for training a DBN to be used for recognition later. The proposed HAR approach showed superior performance over conventional approaches on private and public datasets, indicating a prominent approach for practical applications in smartly controlled environments."

The accuracy and computation efficiency of a machine learning model is dependent on a combination of input variables. The random forest algorithm, one of the machine learning algorithms, can calculate a variable importance that determines the influence of each input variable on the output of the model. In this study, the authors developed three random forest models of a chiller in an existing building as follows: (1) Model A consisting of 12 measured variables from BEMS data, (2) Model B consisting of 2 measured input variables plus 4 new variables constructed by random selection, and (3) Model C consisting of 4 measured input variables plus 2 new variables constructed based on a physics-based equation. The CVRMSE of the three models are 8.56%, 5.44%, and 4.28%, respectively. The findings of this study can be summarized threefold: (1) all three random forest models are good enough to describe the dynamics of the chiller system, (2) the random forest machine learning algorithm can be used to develop a simulation model of the system, and (3) an accurate model can be constructed either by the random selection or the physics-based equation, even when a few input variables are given."

The problem concerning the estimation of common maintenances cost is a sensitive issue and one that is currently receiving a lot of interest from the residents. Factors affecting this issue are complex and diverse. Thus, it is difficult to verify if the results of given estimates are adequate or whether or not the costs are high in comparison to other similar facilities. So, based on the historical data of multi-family housing, this study suggests an estimation model for arriving at common maintenance costs by utilizing the random forest method - a technique used in data mining. The multi-family housing data used in the configuration of the model was collected from certain regions in Seoul and, based on this, the random forest method was used to analyze the factors that influence common maintenance costs in order to develop an estimation model. This model is notable as it differed from traditional statistical methods by utilizing data mining -the random forest method- to build an estimation model for common maintenance costs. As a result of the case verification, the random forest based estimation model in this study is considered useful, and it is expected that more precise estimates will be gradually achieved as the data accumulates due to the nature of data mining and machine learning techniques."

Existing methods to analyze informal data are based mainly on the frequency of informal data, however, this research tries to use correlation information of each informal data. Method: After sentimental analysis to acquire the user information for automobile products, three classification methods, that is, naive Bayes, random forest, and support vector machine, were employed to accurately classify the informal user opinions with respect to automobile qualities. Additionally, Word2vec was applied to discover correlated information about informal data. Result: As applicative results of three classification methods, random forest method shows most effective results compared to the other classification methods. Word2vec method manages to discover closest relevant data with automobile components. Conclusion: The proposed method shows its effectiveness in terms of accuracy and sensitivity on the analysis of informal quality data, however, only two sentiments (positive or negative) can be categorized due to human errors. Further studies are required to derive more sentiments to accurately classify informal quality data. Word2vec method also shows comparative results to discover the relevance of components precisely."

In order to develop these models, 12 different mixes with 288 specimens of the 2, 7, 28, and 90 days compressive strength experimental results of cement mortars containing BFS, WTRP and BFS+WTRP were used in training and testing by Random Forest, Ada Boost, SVM and Bayes classifier machine learning models, which implement standard cement tests. The machine learning models were trained with 288 data that acquired from experimental results. The models had four input parameters that cover the amount of Portland cement, BFS, WTRP and sample ages. Furthermore, it had one output parameter which is compressive strength of cement mortars. Experimental observations from compressive strength tests were compared with predictions of machine learning methods. In order to do predictive experimentation, we exploit R programming language and corresponding packages. During experimentation on the dataset, Random Forest, Ada Boost and SVM models have produced notable good outputs with higher coefficients of determination of R2, RMS and MAPE. Among the machine learning algorithms, Ada Boost presented the best R2, RMS and MAPE values, which are 0.9831, 5.2425 and 0.1105, respectively.

For detecting candidate light blobs, the region of interest (ROI) is decided as front ROI (FROI) and back ROI (BROI) by considering the camera geometry based on perspective range estimation model. Then, light blobs such as headlights, taillights of vehicles, reflection light as well as the surrounding road lighting are segmented using two different adaptive thresholding. From the number of segmented blobs, taillights are first detected using the redness checking and random forest classifier based on Haar-like feature. For the headlight and taillight classification, we use the random forest instead of popular support vector machine or convolutional neural networks for supporting fast learning and testing in real-life applications. Pairing is performed by using the predefined geometric rules, such as vertical coordinate similarity and association check between blobs. The proposed algorithm was successfully applied to various driving sequences in night-time, and the results show that the performance of the proposed algorithms is better than that of recent related works."

Thus, this study conducted experiments using RGB and multispectral images based on UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) over an approximately one-year cycle to create a land cover map of coastal dunes. RF (Random Forest) classifier was used for the analysis in accordance with the experimental region’s characteristics. The pixel- and object-based classification results obtained by using RGB and multispectral cameras were evaluated, respectively. The study results showed that object-based classification using multispectral images had the highest accuracy.

For lead time t = 5 days, ANN1 and RF6 models produce better forecasting results than ANFIS1 and GRNN3 models. For lead time t = 10 days, ANN3 and RF1 models perform better than ANFIS3 and GRNN3 models. It is found that ANN model yields the best performance for all lead times, in terms of model efficiency and graphical comparison.

The data-driven model is advantageous that it is simpler and requires less inputs than the first principles based model. In this study, the authors applied five different machine learning techniques (Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Process, Random Forest, and Genetic Programming) to HVAC systems (chiller, cooling tower, pump, ice thermal storage system and air handling unit) installed in an existing office building. It was found that the five machine learning models are good enough to predict the dynamic behavior of the HVAC systems. The machine learning model made by Genetic Programming is most accurate among the five machine learning models. The models made by Support Vector Machine and Gaussian Process Model require significant computation time and thus are limited in terms of the number of inputs. The accuracy of the model made by Random Forest is dependent on the set of inputs."
Predicting stock price direction by using data mining methods,2017,"['Stock price direction prediction', 'Data Mining', 'Feature selection', 'Single classifiers', 'Ensemble classifiers']",,"This paper proposes a data mining approach to predicting stock price direction. Stock market fluctuates due to many factors. Therefore, predicting stock price direction has become an important issue in the field of stock market analysis. However, in literature, there are few studies applying data mining approaches to predicting the stock price direction. To contribute to literature, this paper proposes comparing single classifiers and ensemble classifiers. Single classifiers include logistic regression, decision tree, neural network, and support vector machine. Ensemble classifiers we consider are adaboost, random forest, bagging, stacking, and vote. For the sake of experiments, we garnered dataset from Korea Stock Exchange (KRX) ranging from 2008 to 2015. Data mining experiments using WEKA revealed that random forest, one of ensemble classifiers, shows best results in terms of metrics such as AUC (area under the ROC curve) and accuracy."

The hourly data was collected by KPS (Korea Power Exchange) between 2008 and 2012. The time trend was eliminated for conducting the pattern of daily electricity demand because electricity demand data is times series data. We have considered k-means clustering, Gaussian mixture model clustering, and functional clustering in order to find the optimal clustering method. The classification analysis was conducted to understand the relationship between external factors, day of the week, holiday, and weather. Data was divided into training data and test data. Training data consisted of external factors and clustered number between 2008 and 2011. Test data was daily data of external factors in 2012. Decision tree, random forest, Support vector machine, and Naive Bayes were used. As a result, Gaussian model based clustering and random forest showed the best prediction performance when the number of cluster was 8."

Especially in retailing industry, where customers have many options of where to spend their money. Classifying loyal customers through customers’ data can help retailing companies build more efficient marketing strategies and gain competitive advantages. This study aims to construct classification models of distinguishing the loyal customers within a Korean retailing company using data mining techniques with R language.Design/methodology/approachIn order to classify retailing customers, we used combination of support vector machines (SVMs) and other classification algorithms of machine learning (ML) with the support of recursive feature elimination (RFE). In particular, we first clean the dataset to remove outlier and impute the missing value. Then we used a RFE framework for electing most significant predictors. Finally, we construct models with classification algorithms, tune the best parameters and compare the performances among them.FindingsThe results reveal that ML classification techniques can work well with CRM data in Korean retailing industry. Moreover, customer loyalty is impacted by not only unique factor such as net promoter score but also other purchase habits such as expensive goods preferring or multi-branch visiting and so on. We also prove that with retailing customer’s dataset the model constructed by SVMs algorithm has given better performance than others. We expect that the models in this study can be used by other retailing companies to classify their customers, then they can focus on giving services to these potential vip group.

However, residents near nature parks could be more vulnerable to natural disasters like floods, tsunamis, and landslides. In order to understand the trade-off between the amenity and hazard effects of nature parks, this study explores the case of the Woomyeon Nature Park (WNP) in Seoul, Korea, which experienced a catastrophic landslide disaster in 2011. The hazard and amenity effects of the WNP before and after a landslide event are analyzed using a difference-in-difference approach with a random coefficient model. The results show that the amenity effect of the WNP has continued after the landslide disaster in apartment complexes near the WNP, but its housing market premiums have fallen by up to 11.3% since the event due to the risk of landslide.

Early Detection of Sudden Pedestrian Crossing for Safe Driving During Summer Nights,2017,,,"<P>Sudden pedestrian crossing (SPC) is the major reason for pedestrian-vehicle crashes. In this paper, we focus on detecting SPCs at night for supporting an advanced driver assistance system using a far-infrared (FIR) camera mounted on the front roof of a vehicle. Although the thermal temperature of the road is similar to or higher than that of the pedestrians during summer nights, many previous researches have focused on pedestrian detection during the winter, spring, or autumn seasons. However, our research concentrates on SPC during the hot summer season because the number of collisions between pedestrians and vehicles in Korea is higher at that time than during the other seasons. For real-time processing, we first decide the optimal levels of image scaling and search area. We then use our proposed method for detecting virtual reference lines that are associated with road segmentation without using color information and change these lines according to the turning direction of the vehicle. Pedestrian detection is conducted using a cascade random forest with low-dimensional Haar-like features and oriented center-symmetric local binary patterns. The SPC is predicted based on the likelihood and the spatiotemporal features of the pedestrians, such as their overlapping ratio with virtual reference lines, as well as the direction and magnitude of each pedestrian's movement. The proposed algorithm was successfully applied to various pedestrian data sets captured by an FIR camera, and the results show that its SPC detection performance is better than those of other methods.</P>"

A spherical ice ball system is one of the most popular ice thermal storage systems used in Korea. However, it is difficult to estimate the degree of freezing and defrosting of the spherical ice ball system and thus, excessive icing commonly occurs in order to prevent any shortage of stored ice. If this rule-of thumb control can be replaced by a simulation model-based control, there would be significant potential for energy savings. In this study, the authors developed 25 machine learning simulation models for the spherical ice thermal storage system installed in a 30-story office building (gross floor area: 32,600m2) located in Seoul, Korea. Five different machine learning algorithms (Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Process, Random Forest, and Genetic Programming) were used for five different input scenarios, respectively. The 25 machine learning models are accurate enough to predict the amount of icing required for the following daytime. In addition, with the use of Model Predictive Control (MPC), 16.8% of excessive icing during overnight can be reduced and 15% of cooling energy (chiller, cooling tower, Brine pump, etc.) can be saved."

The proposed algorithm focuses on the color, shape and texture features, combined to identify the flower quality. In the first phase of implementation, the color features were extracted using the average color difference and color and edge directivity descriptor method. In the second phase of the implementation, the shape and texture features were extracted using Zernike moments and local binary patterns. The third phase involved the classification by using a support vector machine and random forest tree classifiers. The performance of the algorithm was verified by comparing it with the trained and existing data."

In this research, the emotional prototype model proposed by Russell(1980) used to extract and distinguish emotional words to clarify how people in the three countries differently perceive the Korean drama “Goblin”. First of all, the SNS reviews were collected during a two-month period (February 12 to April 12).

Third, random forest was applied to organize the selected variables in the order of variable importance. Fourth, the correlations among the emotional words were compared. Lastly, the accuracy of the trained model was measured using the test dataset. The results show that “Happy” was found to be the greatest factor in Korea and in the United States and “Pleased” in Japan. Emotional words correlations showed that when watching the drama “Goblin”, “passive unpleasure” was the main factor associated with individual’s interest in Korea whereas “passive pleasure” was associated with individual’s interest in Japan and in the United States. Based on the results, this research suggests the possibility of developing evaluation guidelines for emotional responses of different countries towards ‘Hallyu’ contents."

A Machine-Learning Based Approach for Extracting Logical Structure of a Styled Document,2017,"['Logical Structure Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Feature Vector', 'Document Management System']",,"A styled document is a document that contains diverse decorating functions such as different font, colors, tables and images generally authored in a word processor (e.g., MS-WORD, Open Office). Compared to a plain-text document, a styled document enables a human to easily recognize a logical structure such as section, subsection and contents of a document. However, it is difficult for a computer to recognize the structure if a writer does not explicitly specify a type of an element by using the styling functions of a word processor. It is one of the obstacles to enhance document version management systems because they currently manage the document with a file as a unit, not the document elements as a management unit. This paper proposes a machine learning based approach to analyzing the logical structure of a styled document composing of sections, subsections and contents. We first suggest a feature vector for characterizing document elements from a styled document, composing of eight features such as font size, indentation and period, each of which is a frequently discovered item in a styled document. Then, we trained machine learning classifiers such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machine using the suggested feature vector. The trained classifiers are used to automatically identify logical structure of a styled document. Our experiment obtained 92.78% of precision and 94.02% of recall for analyzing the logical structure of 50 styled documents."
S-MTS를 이용한 강판의 표면 결함 진단,2017,"['빅데이터', '데이터마이닝', '다중 클래스 분류', '마할라노비스 다구찌 시스템', '강판 표면 결함 진단', 'Big Data', 'Multiclass Classification', 'Simultaneous MTS(S-MTS)', 'Mahalanobis Taguchi System(MTS)', 'Steel Plates Faults Diagnosis']",,"Steel plate faults is one of important factors to affect the quality and price of the steel plates. So far many steelmakers generally have used visual inspection method that could be based on an inspectors intuition or experience. Specifically, the inspector checks the steel plate faults by looking the surface of the steel plates. However, the accuracy of this method is critically low that it can cause errors above 30% in judgment. Therefore, accurate steel plate faults diagnosis system has been continuously required in the industry. In order to meet the needs, this study proposed a new steel plate faults diagnosis system using Simultaneous MTS (S-MTS), which is an advanced Mahalanobis Taguchi System (MTS) algorithm, to classify various surface defects of the steel plates. MTS has generally been used to solve binary classification problems in various fields, but MTS was not used for multiclass classification due to its low accuracy. The reason is that only one mahalanobis space is established in the MTS. In contrast, S-MTS is suitable for multi-class classification. That is, S-MTS establishes individual mahalanobis space for each class. Simultaneous implies comparing mahalanobis distances at the same time. The proposed steel plate faults diagnosis system was developed in four main stages. In the first stage, after various reference groups and related variables are defined, data of the steel plate faults is collected and used to establish the individual mahalanobis space per the reference groups and construct the full measurement scale. In the second stage, the mahalanobis distances of test groups is calculated based on the established mahalanobis spaces of the reference groups. Then, appropriateness of the spaces is verified by examining the separability of the mahalanobis diatances. In the third stage, orthogonal arrays and Signal-to-Noise (SN) ratio of dynamic type are applied for variable optimization. Also, Overall SN ratio gain is derived from the SN ratio and SN ratio gain. If the derived overall SN ratio gain is negative, it means that the variable should be removed. However, the variable with the positive gain may be considered as worth keeping. Finally, in the fourth stage, the measurement scale that is composed of selected useful variables is reconstructed. Next, an experimental test should be implemented to verify the ability of multi-class classification and thus the accuracy of the classification is acquired. If the accuracy is acceptable, this diagnosis system can be used for future applications. Also, this study compared the accuracy of the proposed steel plate faults diagnosis system with that of other popular classification algorithms including Decision Tree, Multi Perception Neural Network (MLPNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Tree Bagger Random Forest, Grid Search (GS), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The steel plates faults dataset used in the study is taken from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository. As a result, the proposed steel plate faults diagnosis system based on S-MTS shows 90.79% of classification accuracy. The accuracy of the proposed diagnosis system is 6-27% higher than MLPNN, LR, GS, GA and PSO. Based on the fact that the accuracy of commercial systems is only about 75-80%, it means that the proposed system has enough classification performance to be applied in the industry. In addition, the proposed system can reduce the number of measurement sensors that are installed in the fields because of variable optimization process. These results show that the proposed system not only can have a good ability on the steel plate faults diagnosis but also reduce operation and maintenance cost. For our future work, it will be applied in the fields to validate actual effectiveness of the proposed system and plan to improve the accuracy based on the results."
카테고리 중립 단어 활용을 통한 주가 예측 방안,2017,"['주가 예측', '중립 단어', '텍스트 마이닝', '온라인 뉴스', 'Stock Price', 'Neutral Terms', 'Text Mining', 'Online News']",,"Since the stock market is driven by the expectation of traders, studies have been conducted to predict stock price movements through analysis of various sources of text data. In order to predict stock price movements, research has been conducted not only on the relationship between text data and fluctuations in stock prices, but also on the trading stocks based on news articles and social media responses. Studies that predict the movements of stock prices have also applied classification algorithms with constructing term-document matrix in the same way as other text mining approaches.  Because the document contains a lot of words, it is better to select words that contribute more for building a term-document matrix. Based on the frequency of words, words that show too little frequency or importance are removed. It also selects words according to their contribution by measuring the degree to which a word contributes to correctly classifying a document.  The basic idea of constructing a term-document matrix was to collect all the documents to be analyzed and to select and use the words that have an influence on the classification. In this study, we analyze the documents for each individual item and select the words that are irrelevant for all categories as neutral words. We extract the words around the selected neutral word and use it to generate the term-document matrix. The neutral word itself starts with the idea that the stock movement is less related to the existence of the neutral words, and that the surrounding words of the neutral word are more likely to affect the stock price movements. And apply it to the algorithm that classifies the stock price fluctuations with the generated term-document matrix.  In this study, we firstly removed stop words and selected neutral words for each stock. And we used a method to exclude words that are included in news articles for other stocks among the selected words. Through the online news portal, we collected four months of news articles on the top 10 market cap stocks. We split the news articles into 3 month news data as training data and apply the remaining one month news articles to the model to predict the stock price movements of the next day. We used SVM, Boosting and Random Forest for building models and predicting the movements of stock prices. The stock market opened for four months (2016/02/01 ~ 2016/05/31) for a total of 80 days, using the initial 60 days as a training set and the remaining 20 days as a test set. The proposed word - based algorithm in this study showed better classification performance than the word selection method based on sparsity.  This study predicted stock price volatility by collecting and analyzing news articles of the top 10 stocks in market cap. We used the term - document matrix based classification model to estimate the stock price fluctuations and compared the performance of the existing sparse - based word extraction method and the suggested method of removing words from the term - document matrix. The suggested method differs from the word extraction method in that it uses not only the news articles for the corresponding stock but also other news items to determine the words to extract. In other words, it removed not only the words that appeared in all the increase and decrease but also the words that appeared common in the news for other stocks. When the prediction accuracy was compared, the suggested method showed higher accuracy.  The limitation of this study is that the stock price prediction was set up to classify the rise and fall, and the experiment was conducted only for the top ten stocks. The 10 stocks used in the experiment do not represent the entire stock market. In addition, it is difficult to show the investment performance because stock price fluctuation and profit rate may be different. Therefore, it is necessary to study the research using more stocks and the yield prediction through trading simulation."
Comparative Analysis of Simple Volume Models for Japanese Larch(Larix kaempferi) Species in the Central Region of South Korea,2017,"['Forest volume stock', 'Larix kaempferi', 'Logarithmic volume models']",,"This study was conducted to develop a simple volume model for the Larix kaempferi species in the Central Region of South Korea. General volume model forms were used and validated using a subset of the data collected for the L. kaempferi species. A total of 550 trees were collected in the different L. kaempferi stands through destructive sampling. The dataset was randomly divided into two: 80% for initial model development(seven volume models) and 20% for model validation. The 100% dataset was used for the final model fitting. Evaluation statistics including bias(Ē), absolute mean deviation(AMD), root mean square error(RMSE), coefficient of determination(R2), and the Akaike Information Criterion values(AIC) and weight (AICw) were used to assess performance of the different volume models. Rank analysis was employed and the first five best volume models were chosen for the model validation and final model fitting. The evaluations showed that volume model 4(V=aDBHb*Hc) had the best performance, while volume model 3(V=aDBH+bDBH2), which has a single variable, had the poorest performance."
