Deep Neural Network Self-training Based on Unsupervised Learning and Dropout,2017,"['Neural network', 'Pre-training', 'Semi-supervised learning', 'Self-training', 'Dropout']",,"In supervised learning methods, a large amount of labeled data is necessary to find reliable classification boundaries to train a classifier. However, it is hard to obtain a large amount of labeled data in practice and it is time-consuming with a lot of cost to obtain labels of data. Although unlabeled data is comparatively plentiful than labeled data, most of supervised learning methods are not designed to exploit unlabeled data. Self-training is one of the semisupervised learning methods that alternatively repeat training a base classifier and labeling unlabeled data in training set. Most self-training methods have adopted confidence measures to select confidently labeled examples because high-confidence usually implies low error. A major difficulty of self-training is the error amplification. If a classifier misclassifies some examples and the misclassified examples are included in the labeled training set, the next classifier may learn improper classification boundaries and generate more misclassified examples. Since base classifiers are built with small labeled dataset and are hard to earn good generalization performance due to the small labeled dataset. Although improving training procedure and the performance of classifiers, error occurrence is inevitable, so corrections of self-labeled data are necessary to avoid error amplification in the following classifiers. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network based approach for alleviating the problems of self-training by combining schemes: pre-training, dropout and error forgetting. By applying combinations of these schemes to various dataset, a trained classifier using our approach shows improved performance than trained classifier using common self-training."

An Improved Cat Swarm Optimization Algorithm Based on Opposition-Based Learning and Cauchy Operator for Clustering,2017,"['Cat Swarm Optimization', 'Cauchy Mutation Operator', 'Clustering', 'Opposition-Based Learning', 'Particle Swarm Optimization']",,"Clustering is a NP-hard problem that is used to find the relationship between patterns in a given set of patterns.

However, this algorithm suffers from diversity and local optima problems. To overcome these problems, we are proposing an improved version of the CSO algorithm by using opposition-based learning and the Cauchy mutation operator. We applied the opposition-based learning method to enhance the diversity of the CSO algorithm and we used the Cauchy mutation operator to prevent the CSO algorithm from trapping in local optima.

Complex Video Scene Analysis Using Kernelized-Collaborative Behavior Pattern Learning Based on Hierarchical Representative Object Behaviors,2017,,,"<P>This paper considers an unsupervised learning algorithm that can automatically discover key behavior patterns to characterize a complex video scene. For behavior features (bFs) extracted at multiple spatial-temporal scales, an optimization problem is formulated to cluster bFs in their scales while establishing a collaborative nonlinear relationship in the form of a kernel regression function among clustered bFs across different spatial scales. The relationship allows features extracted in one scale to be considered as contextual information in the analysis of another scale. This optimization problem is solved using linear programming to reduce computational complexity. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on four crowded traffic scenes and two sports video data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a better performance compared with the current state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of video segmentation accuracy.</P>"

딥 러닝 군집화를 이용한 QPSK 신호 비트 오류율 성능 평가,2017,"['clustering-based unsupervised learning', 'detection', 'deep learning']","딥 러닝 분야에서 활용되고 있는 군집화에 기반한 자율학습(CUL, Clustering-based Unsupervised Learning) 기법을 QPSK 검파에 적용하였다. 기존 QPSK 검파는 전송 심볼의 참조 성상점을 기준으로 최대공산(ML, Maximum Likelihood)에 의해서 수행되었던 반면, CUL을 사용하면 군집이 네 개라는 정보만으로 검파를 수행하게 된다. CUL에서는 자율학습에 입력으로 제공되는 심볼 집합의 크기와 중심점 결정을 위한 반복 회수 및 신호 대 잡음비가 검파 성능을 결정하며, 검파 성능은 추정된 중심점과 참조 성상점 사이의 평균 자승 오차와 비트 오류율을 통하여 평가하였다. CUL으로 검파할 때, 임의로 선택된 초기 중심점을 사용하는 경우 신호 대 잡음비가 개선되어도 비트 오류율이 개선되지 않는다는 사실을 발견하였다. 이 문제를 해결하기 위하여 QPSK 검파에 적합한 초기 중심점 선택 기법을 제안하였으며, 이를 통하여 딥 러닝 기법을 이용한 검파에서 기존의 ML 검파와 동일한 수준의 비트오류율 성능을 달성하였다.","We apply the clustering-based unsupervised learning (CUL) in deep learning field to QPSK detection. The conventional QPSK detection has been performed by maximum likelihood (ML) based on the reference symbols. On the other hand, if the CUL is used, the detection is performed with only information of the number of clusters. In the CUL, the detection performance is determined by the size of the symbol set, the number of repetitions and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The detection performance is evaluated through the mean square error between the estimated center and reference symbols and bit error rate (BER). We found that the BER is not improved even if the SNR is improved when using arbitrarily selected initial center points. To solve this problem, we propose an initial center-point selection technique suitable for the QPSK detection, and achieve BER performance equal to that of conventional ML detection."
Estimation of fundamental period of reinforced concrete shear wall buildings using self organization feature map,2017,"['fundamental period', 'Reinforced Concrete Shear Wall (RC SW) buildings', 'Genetic Algorithm (GA)', 'nonlinear regression analysis', 'Self-Organization Feature Map (SOFM)']",,"The Self-Organization Feature Map as an unsupervised network is very widely used these days in engineering science.

Various approaches have been proposed to address this problem, including the knowledge base approach. This approach defines the sense of an ambiguous word in accordance with knowledge base information with no training corpus. In unsupervised learning techniques that use a knowledge base approach, graph-based and similarity-based methods have been the main research areas. The graph-based method has the advantage of constructing a semantic graph that delineates all paths between different senses that an ambiguous word may have. However, unnecessary semantic paths may be introduced, thereby increasing the risk of errors. To solve this problem and construct a fine-grained graph, in this paper, we propose a model that iteratively constructs the graph while eliminating unnecessary nodes and edges, i.e., senses and semantic paths. The hybrid similarity estimation model was applied to estimate a more accurate sense in the constructed semantic graph. Because the proposed model uses BabelNet, a multilingual lexical knowledge base, the model is not limited to a specific language."

Recognizing Actions from Different Views by Topic Transfer,2017,"['action recognition', 'topic model', 'transfer learning', 'cross-view']",,"In this paper, we describe a novel method for recognizing human actions from different views via view knowledge transfer. Our approach is characterized by two aspects: 1) We propose a unsupervised topic transfer model (TTM) to model two view-dependent vocabularies, where the original bag of visual words (BoVW) representation can be transferred into a bag of topics (BoT) representation. The higher-level BoT features, which can be shared across views, can connect action models for different views. 2) Our features make it possible to obtain a discriminative model of action under one view and categorize actions in another view. We tested our approach on the IXMAS data set, and the results are promising, given such a simple approach. In addition, we also demonstrate a supervised topic transfer model (STTM), which can combine transfer feature learning and discriminative classifier learning into one framework."

The emotion pattern classifier was composed of unsupervised learning algorithm with hidden nodes and feature vectors. Restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) based on probability estimation was used in the unsupervised learning and maps emotion features to transformed dimensions.

As a preprocessing task, both the sketch image database and the projected image database of the 3D objects are built by learning with various user-drawn sketch images and suggestive contour images of the 3D objects respectively, and each sketch image is mapped to the most similar projected database image by measuring the similarity. This enables us to avoid a direct comparison of the sketch query and the projected images of the 3D objects and to use the learned robust sparse features of the trained sketch images in the sketch database, compensating for the difference between the user-drawn sketch image and synthesized images of the 3D mesh model. The locally-enforced feature optimization of the local and global features of the database images reduces the error and retains the feature properties. Furthermore, we quantitatively compared the proposed method to previous remarkable object recognition approaches. Numerous experiments on various challenging 3D objects and sketch images demonstrate that the proposed methodology performs favorably against several state-of-the-art algorithms.</P>"
