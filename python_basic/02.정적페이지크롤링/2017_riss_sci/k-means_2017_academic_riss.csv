의미 기반 문단 분할을 활용한 문단 기반 K-Means 클러스터링,2017,"['Document retrieval', 'Clustering', 'Meaning-based paragraph', 'K-means clustering method', 'Reuter-21578 document set', 'Precision', 'recall']",,"As the number of electronic documents explosively increases, it becomes more and more difficult to retrieve information from them rapidly and accurately. To solve this problem, documents are clustered in various ways and generally K-Means algorithm is used to achieve it. K-Means algorithm is adequate to cluster so many documents rapidly and easily, but it does not consider the meaning of documents on clustering. In this research, we propose a document clustering technique of using meaning-based paragraphs. The proposed technique divides documents in a document set into meaning-based paragraphs by measuring similarity between sentences, chooses representative paragraphs having the maximum coherence value from each document, and then commits K-Means algorithm depending on them. In this paper, different from existing methods, we proposed a novel similarity function between two adjacent sentences by using WordNet as a ontology to calculate the similarity between words. And we introduced a method which can be used to calculate coherence of meaning-based paragraph by normalizing the sum of tf-idf value of words in the paragraph. We conducted experiments to prove the performance of the proposed technique by using the Reuter-21578 document set. The experimental result showed the document clustering technique of using meaning-based paragraphs improves the precision and the recall of document retrieval."
K-Means 클러스터링을 적용한 향상된 CS-RANSAC 알고리즘,2017,"['RANSAC', 'CS_RANSAC', 'K-Means Clustering']",,"Estimating the correct pose of augmented objects on the real camera view efficiently is one of the most important questions in image tracking area. In computer vision, Homography is used for camera pose estimation in augmented reality system with markerless. To estimating Homography, several algorithm like SURF features which extracted from images are used. Based on extracted features, Homography is estimated. For this purpose, RANSAC algorithm is well used to estimate homography and DCS-RANSAC algorithm is researched which apply constraints dynamically based on Constraint Satisfaction Problem to improve performance. In DCS-RANSAC, however, the dataset is based on pattern of feature distribution of images manually, so this algorithm cannot classify the input image, pattern of feature distribution is not recognized in DCS-RANSAC algorithm, which lead to reduce it`s performance. To improve this problem, we suggest the KCS-RANSAC algorithm using K-means clustering in CS-RANSAC to cluster the images automatically based on pattern of feature distribution and apply constraints to each image groups. The suggested algorithm cluster the images automatically and apply the constraints to each clustered image groups. The experiment result shows that our KCS-RANSAC algorithm outperformed the DCS-RANSAC algorithm in terms of speed, accuracy, and inlier rate."

The study result suggests two implementations. First one is the behavioral characteristics of leisure sports by life characteristics. In K-means cluster analysis, it was classified into 3 groups; ostentation type, well-being seeking type, exercise type Ostentation type is a group with conspicuous leisure sports participation behavior, but negative to well-being. Also, they were quiet young who are close to participation rather than active exercise. Well-being seeking type saw healthy food, sleeping and resting along with exercise as important and most of them were in their 40s or older, and with high-income. Exercise type is a type focusing on physical training through exercise which showed high interest toward well-being, and mostly shown in the 20s and 60s. Second is the analysis of participation characteristic of leisure sports and market segmentation. The ostentation type is classified as a group preferring premium goods such as premium sportswear and premium goods. As for the demographic characteristics, they were young generation below age 30, and showed high purchase power compared to income. The well-being seeking type is a group interested in sleeping, meal and physics who are in their 40-50s with income level of the middle class or higher. As for the exercise type, it is a group of strong physical ability who are not well-being type nor ostentation type. It is composed of people in 10-20s or over 60s who had lower consumption or monthly income."

The row housing and multiplex housing is a blind spot for real estate information. Because there is a social problem, due to the change in market size and information asymmetry due to changes in demand. Also, the 5 or 25 districts used by the Seoul Metropolitan Government or the Korean Appraisal Board(hereafter, KAB) were established within the administrative boundaries and used in existing real estate studies. This is not a district classification for real estate researches because it is zoned urban planning. Based on the existing study, this study found that the city needs to reset the Seoul Metropolitan Governments spatial structure in estimating future housing prices. So, This study attempted to classify the area without spatial heterogeneity by the reflected the property price characteristics of row housing and Multiplex housing. In other words, There has been a problem that an inefficient side has arisen due to the simple division by the existing administrative district. Therefore, this study aims to cluster Seoul as a new area for more efficient real estate analysis. This study was applied to the hedonic model based on the real transactions price data of row housing and multiplex housing. And the K-Means Clustering algorithm was used to cluster the spatial structure of Seoul. In this study, data onto real transactions price of the Seoul Row housing and Multiplex Housing from January 2014 to December 2016, and the official land value of 2016 was used and it provided by Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport(hereafter, MOLIT). Data preprocessing was followed by the following processing procedures: Removal of underground transaction, Price standardization per area, Removal of Real transaction case(above 5 and below -5). In this study, we analyzed data from 132,707 cases to 126,759 data through data preprocessing. The data analysis tool used the R program. After data preprocessing, data model was constructed. Priority, the K-means Clustering was performed. In addition, a regression analysis was conducted using Hedonic model and it was conducted a cosine similarity analysis. Based on the constructed data model, we clustered on the basis of the longitude and latitude of Seoul and conducted comparative analysis of existing area. The results of this study indicated that the goodness of fit of the model was above 75 % and the variables used for the Hedonic model were significant. In other words, 5 or 25 districts that is the area of the existing administrative area are divided into 16 districts. So, this study derived a clustering method of row housing and multiplex housing in Seoul using K-Means Clustering algorithm and hedonic model by the reflected the property price characteristics. Moreover, they presented academic and practical implications and presented the limitations of this study and the direction of future research. Academic implication has clustered by reflecting the property price characteristics in order to improve the problems of the areas used in the Seoul Metropolitan Government, KAB, and Existing Real Estate Research. Another academic implications are that apartments were the main study of existing real estate research, and has proposed a method of classifying area in Seoul using public information(i.e., real-data of MOLIT) of government 3.0. Practical implication is that it can be used as a basic data for real estate related research on row housing and multiplex housing. Another practical implications are that is expected the activation of row housing and multiplex housing research and, that is expected to increase the accuracy of the model of the actual transaction. The future research direction of this study involves conducting various analyses to overcome the limitations of the threshold and indicates the need for deeper researc"

If there is a lot of dataset to be trained, general clustering may not learn dataset due to the lack of memory capacity. However, the on-line processing of big data could be effectively realized through the parameters operation of recursive least square estimation as well as the sequential operation of incremental clustering algorithm. Radial basis function neural networks consist of condition part, conclusion part and aggregation part. In the condition part, incremental K-means clustering algorithms is used tweights of the conclusion part are given as linear function and parameters are calculated using recursive least squareo get the center points of data and find the fitness using gaussian function as the activation function. Connection s estimation. In the aggregation part, a final output is obtained by center of gravity method. Using machine learning data, performance index are shown and compared with other models. Also, the performance of the incremental K-means clustering based-RBFNNs is carried out by using PSO.

Assessment of Premature Ventricular Contraction Arrhythmia by K-means Clustering Algorithm,2017,"['Electrocardiogram', 'Premature Ventricular Contraction', 'K-Means Clustering', 'Poincare Plot', 'Heart Rate Variability']",,"Premature Ventricular Contraction(PVC) arrhythmia is most common abnormal-heart rhythm that may increase mortal risk of a cardiac patient. Thus, it is very important issue to identify the specular portraits of PVC pattern especially from the patient. In this paper, we propose a new method to extract the characteristics of PVC pattern by applying K-means machine learning algorithm on Heart Rate Variability depicted in Poinecare plot. For the quantitative analysis to distinguish the trend of cluster patterns between normal sinus rhythm and PVC beat, the Euclidean distance measure was sought between the clusters. Experimental simulations on MIT-BIH arrhythmia database draw the fact that the distance measure on the cluster is valid for differentiating the pattern-traits of PVC beats. Therefore, we proposed a method that can offer the simple remedy to identify the attributes of PVC beats in terms of K-means clusters especially in the long-period Electrocardiogram(ECG)."

These researches consider the effect of nonresponse rates in the estimation of the population mean in survey data, and it is hard to find researches to evaluate the effect of nonresponse rates on other types of analysis. Cluster analysis groups similar observations into the same cluster. Since the main interest of the cluster analysis is on the misclassification rates, not on the estimation of the cluster means, it is necessary to approach this problem differently. This research focuses on k-means cluster analysis when missing values are imputed and evaluates how nonresponse rates are related to misclassification rates. Especially, overlaps on distributions among clusters, missing data mechanisms, and imputation methods are considered as factors that may influence on the quality of the k-means clustering, and a simulation is conducted to evaluate the effect of these factors on the relationship between the nonresponse rates and misclassification rates. When distributions among clusters do not overlap, it shows that nonrespose rates are not related to misclassification rates."

The k-means cluster analysis conducts grouping of observations based on an optimization method minimizing the sum of Euclidean distances between observations and their cluster centers. In real data, missing values often occur in some variables, and when cluster analysis is conducted for missing data, it is common to exclude observations with missing values. However, in this case, missing values cannot be classified into any group, and it may cause biases in estimating cluster centers. Therefore, to include observations with missing values in cluster analysis, it is often to impute missing values and conduct cluster analysis using imputed data. A disadvantage of this imputation approach is to conduct imputation without using cluster information. In this study, we propose methods to impute missing values using cluster information. Simulation is conducted to compare performance of the suggested imputation method with the one based on imputation without using cluster information. The proposed imputation method provides better results than the one ignoring cluster information."

K－IFRS 도입 이전과 이후를 분석하기 위해서 이전기간은 2006년부터 2007년까지로 이후기간은 2012년부터 2103년까지로 구분하였고, 유가증권과 코스닥에 상장되어 있는 기업을 표본으로 선정하여 총 3,516 기업－년도를 이용하였다.  본 연구의 분석결과는 다음과 같다. 첫째, IFRS 도입 이후에 기업집단의 재량적 발생액 수준이 이전에 비해 증가하였다. K－IFRS 도입 이후에 기업집단의 재량적 발생액 수준이 증가하는 이유에 대해서는 K－IFRS가 비기업집단보다 기업집단의 경영자들에게 회계선택과 공정가치 평가에 대한 기회를 더 많이 제공하기 때문이라고 판단된다. 둘째, K－IFRS 도입 이후에 기업집단의 실제활동 이익조정 수준이 감소하였다. 이러한 결과는 K－IFRS 도입 이후에 기업집단의 발생액을 이용한 이익조정이 증가 하고 실제활동을 이용한 이익조정이 감소함으로써 이익조정간에 대체관계가 있다는 것을 보여준다.  추가분석에 따른 결과는 다음과 같다. 첫째, K－IFRS 도입 이후에 실제활동 이익조정 개별 측정치 모두 감소하였다. 둘째, 성향점수매칭(PSM) 방법에 따른 분석에서도 본 분석과 동일한 결과를 얻었으며, 본 연구의 결과가 기업집단의 내생성 때문에 나타난 이유보다는 기업집단이 원칙주의 회계기준을 경영자의 이익조정에 활용할 수 있는 기회가 많아졌기 때문이라는 것을 알 수 있다. 마지막으로 이익조정 측정치의 절대값 분석, 기업집단․비기업집단 표본을 구분하여 분석을 실시하였으며, 그 결과는 본 연구결과를 강건하게 한다.  본 연구의 결과가 제공하는 시사점은 IFRS 도입 이후 경영자들이 회계기준을 선택할 수 있는 폭이 넓어진 만큼 동일한 국가 내에서도 터널링 가설(tunneling hypothesis)에 근거하여 기업집단의 경영자가 기회주의적 이익조정을 할 유인이 더 크다는 것이다. 또한 본 연구를 통해서 K－IFRS 도입 전․후를 비교함으로써 기업집단의 이익조정에 대한 새로운 정보를 제공하였다.","This study investigates the effect of K－IFRS on earnings management of chaebol firms. Discretionary accruals and real－activities earnings management are used as earnings management proxies, so this study would confirm how chaebol firms conduct earnings management under K－IFRS.  We use the sample listed on KOSPI and KOSDAQ from 2006 to 2007 for pre－K－IFRS and from 2012 to 2013 for post－K－IFRS, so 3,516 firm－year are used in our analysis models during sample periods.  The results are as follows. First, we find that discretionary accruals earnings management of chaebol firms increases after K－IFRS adoption, which suggests that managers of chaebol firms have more chances to conduct earnings management with various choices of accounting standards and fair valuation after K－IFRS adoption. Second, we find that real－activities earnings management of chaebol firms decreases after K－IFRS adoption, which means that the adoption of K－IFRS makes the tradeoff between discretionary accruals and real－activities earnings management of chaebol firms.  The results of additional analysis are as follows. First, we find that abnormal operating cash flow, abnormal discretionary expenses, and abnormal production costs all decrease after K－IFRS through analysis by individual factor of real－activities earnings management. Second, we find that the results with PSM (Propensity Score Matching) are the same with the main results, which means that our results are due to more opportunities of earnings management with various choices of accounting standards and fair valuation under K－IFRS in chaebol firms, not merely because of endogeneity of chabol firms. Finally, we perform regressions with subsample of chaebol and non－chaebol and regressions with absolute value of discretionary accruals earnings management and real－activities earnings management and the results make the main results from regressions with total sample robust."

스파크 프레임워크를 위한 병렬적 k-Modes 알고리즘,2017,"['k-모드', '범주적 데이터', '클러스터링', '스파크']",클러스터링은 빅데이터 분석 및 데이터 마이닝 분야에서 데이터 간 유사성을 파악하기 위해 사용하는 기법으로 다양한 클러스터링 기법 중 범주적 데이터를 위해 k-Modes 알고리즘이 대표적으로 사용된다. k-Modes와 같이 반복적 연산이 집중된 작업의 속도를 향상시키기 위해 많은 관심을 받고 있는 분산 병행 프레임워크 스파크는 하둡과 달리 RDD라는 추상화 객체 개념을 사용하여 대용량의 데이터를 메모리 상에서 처리 가능한 환경을 제공한다. 스파크는 다양한 기계학습을 위한 라이브러리인 Mllib을 제공하고 있으나 연속적 데이터만 처리 가능한 k-means만 포함되어 있어 범주적 데이터 처리가 불가능한 한계가 있다. 따라서 본 논문에서는 스파크 환경에서 범주적 데이터 클러스터링을 위한 k-Modes 알고리즘을 위한 RDD 설계하고 효과적으로 동작할 수 있는 알고리즘을 구현하였다. 실험을 통해 제안한 알고리즘이 스파크 환경에서 선형적으로 증가한다는 것을 보였다.,"Clustering is a technique which is used to measure similarities between data in big data analysis and data mining field. Among various clustering methods, k-Modes algorithm is representatively used for categorical data. To increase the performance of iterative-centric tasks such as k-Modes, a distributed and concurrent framework Spark has been received great attention recently because it overcomes the limitation of Hadoop. Spark provides an environment that can process large amount of data in main memory using the concept of abstract objects called RDD. Spark provides Mllib, a dedicated library for machine learning, but Mllib only includes k-means that can process only continuous data, so there is a limitation that categorical data processing is impossible. In this paper, we design RDD for k-Modes algorithm for categorical data clustering in spark environment and implement an algorithm that can operate effectively. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm increases linearly in the spark environment."
동일 Big 4 감사인과 K-IFRS가 회계이익의 비교가능성에 미치는 영향,2017,"['비교가능성', 'Big 4 감사인', '한국채택 국제회계기준', 'Comparability', 'Big 4 auditor', 'K-IFRS']",,"This study investigates whether the accounting earnings comparability of firm-pairs audited by the same Big 4 auditor is likely to be higher than that audited by the different auditors and whether the accounting earnings comparability is likely to increase after K-IFRS adoption. The results are as follows. First, we find that the comparability increases after K-IFRS adoption, which means that accountants and auditors try to develop internal working rules to standardize accounting practice to apply the principle-based accounting standards(Kothari et al. 2010). Second, we find that the comparability of firm-pairs audited by the same Big 4 auditor increase more than that audited by the different auditors after K-IFRS adoption, which suggests that Big 4 accounting firms invest more to implement their set of internal working rule after K-IFRS adoption.The implications of our study is that the comparability increases after K-IFRS adoption and the comparability of firm-pairs audited by the different Big 4 auditors increases as well as firm-pairs audited by the same Big 4 auditor. Therefore, K-IFRS, the principle-based accounting standards play a key role to improve the level of comparability. We also find that the comparability of firm-pairs audited by the same Big 4 auditor increase more than that audited by the different Big 4 auditors after K-IFRS adoption. Therefore, Big 4 accounting firms have their set of internal working rule according to the argument of Francis et al.(2014) and try more to enforce auditing standards and GAAP within their clienteles after K-IFRS adoption."

Specifically, other than the proportion of account receivable and inventory which has been known as measurement for inherent risk or complexity of accounts through prior research, we examine whether auditors reflect the inherent risk of detailed accounts such as derivatives, deferred tax, investments on subsidiaries(affiliated companies) and retirement benefits liabilities in audit-related variables. We also investigate whether the auditors’ responses to audit risk after K-IFRS(International Financial Reporting Standards, thereafter ‘IFRS’) adoption are different by auditor type such as Big4 and Non-Big4 auditors, and the differential responses to audit risk by auditor type, in any, are related to the difference in audit quality.Using 10,244 firm-year samples between 2007 and 2014, we find the following empirical results: First, the inherent risks of the derivatives accounts are reflected in the audit fees, and the inherent risks of the investments on subsidiaries(affiliated companies) and retirement benefit liabilities accounts are reflected in both audit fees and audit efforts. And this result in significant decrease in the hourly fee rate and appeared only in Big4 auditors sample. Second, there exist increase in audit hours as a response to audit risk for derivatives, investments on subsidiaries(affiliated companies) accounts, and decrease in the hourly fee rate for investments on subsidiaries(affiliated companies) accounts in Big4 auditor sample. This is presumably due to over investment in audit effort of Big4 auditors to consolidated financial statement audits under IFRS environment which consider consolidated financial statements as primary financial statements and require auditor responsibility for the financial statements of subsidiary companies. In Non-Big4 auditor sample, there is no relationship between the inherent risk of detailed accounts and audit hours after IFRS adoption except for decrease in hourly audit fee. This means Non-Big4 auditors strategically respond to increased audit risk by using more experienced auditors. Third, there is no audit quality decline in any sample of Big4 and Non-Big4 auditors, implying that auditors keep audit quality at a certain level, even though they have perceived audit risk and complexity of the detailed accounts and performed different audit procedures by auditor type.We contribute to the existing literature by extending prior research as follows. First, this study comprehensively shows the association between the inherent audit risk and audit-related variables like audit fees could be decomposed into the inherent risks of detailed account to derivatives, deferred tax, investments on subsidiaries(affiliated companies) and retirement benefits liabilities accounts. Second, this study provides an explanation about the different profitability decline of Big4 and Non-Big4 rasied by prior research, as a differential risk response process by auditor type. Third, this study suggests auditors have differently responded to the inherent risk of detailed accounts but have kept audit quality to the certain level, when there is a increase in auditors’ liability. Finally, this study provides current literature with new audit risk measurement method about detailed account such as derivatives, deferred tax, investments on subsidiaries(affiliated companies) and retirement benefits liabilities accounts."

M. Coetzee’s Life & Times of Michael K. Michael’s solitary yet sufficient life as a gardener offers us a more extended way of understanding Agamben’s notions of “happy life,” or “form-of-life.” Throughout the novel, Michael undergoes a significant transformation. At the beginning, his life in many ways resembles Agamben’s concept of “bare life,” but soon new form of life begins to emerge in his deserted condition of life. In other words, Coetzee later in the novel shows us a touch of hope and political futurity through Michael’s passive-active resistance against the government’s identity politics. However, Agamben’s “pure potentials” should not be confused with moralistic values such as will power, faith, and determination. Rather, it is achieved when one’s state of abandonment is pushed to the extreme beyond any light of humanistic values. Both Coetzee in Life & Times of Michael K and Agamben in his theories well demonstrate what it means to live as a “bare life” and what mode of being inaugurates the true “form-of-life” in today’s global biopolitical system."

Students learn the Korean youth culture history in advance through the professor’s lecture and conduct the active group learning with reference to the result of survey on young men and the questionnaire presented by the professor. Students experienced various communications through the group presentation, report writing, group discussion, 5-minute speech, and final exam, and drew the following conclusion.The most important characteristic of the current youth culture in 2016 is defined as the timeliness and communication power. The youth generation which grew with the IT change such as smart phone and tablet PC even comprehends the receptive capacity, flexibility, and transformation power of the culture. They can be named the multi subjects bearing the proper nature as the culture subject comprehending the production, consumption, and distribution. The texts enjoyed and reproduced by these multi subjects contain the use of informal verbal language, subject of de-authority, cynical smile and resistance to the mainstream culture, and emotion of class-B culture based on the mockery. Young men desire for their aim while accepting the ambivalence of the language and concept at the same time and resisting the social discourse endlessly.This study is significant as the specialized class method in having well realized the characteristic of individual subject called the pop culture analysis through the intermediation means called the communication of writing and speaking by students who were the subjects of the activity system."

By using mainly J. F. K. Rosenkranz`s elaborative theory of the “aesthetics of ugliness,” this analysis tries to respond to the question what should be determined as caricature. The purpose of this study is essentially to expand the horizon of interpreting poetry. Caricature is noticed by this purpose because it touches the ugliness being more reinforced than satire, allegory, and parody. The most important factor crystallizing the aesthetic of caricature is the essence of caricature playing its central role in expressing its object “exaggeratively.” The quantitative limitation on exaggeration that Rosenkranz emphasized signifies that caricature can be established if a formative moment to evoke its original image has to remain in its transformed image. And the necessary condition of caricature`s establishment that he presented is that the exaggeration of caricature to produce the displacement of ugliness through the exaggerative expression being actually distinct from the mere expansion and reinforcement or reducement and enfeeblement should be the “unbalance” or “contortion” occurring between its object`s totality and parts. Meanwhile he summarized the essential productive ways of caricature into the “individualization,” “usurpation,” and “downgrading.” The “individualization” means that caricature to occur between its original image and contorted image should be transmitted by its concrete form but not reflects any concept or abstract significance. The “usurpation” means caricature`s inflating exaggeratively deficient capabilities, and the “downgrading” means it`s degrading exaggeratively existent capabilities. Having a function of the “language of aggression,” caricature as such relates to the “socialization of a person,” as Umberto Eco held that “the modern caricature emerged as an instrument of dispute over the real person or cognizable social category.” Uncovering freely and humorously the real ugliness behind our lives by expressing the “forms of ugliness,” caricature ultimately contains the positive dreams of humans hoping indirect compensations for their greatness and agony."

Due to a big bang of knowledge, the amount of knowledge has increased remarkably, but its expected life span has become relatively short. The college education should give an impetus to the new revolution in order to raise a creative and global leader in a sense of consilience of human resources. In the age of the 4th industrial revolution, in which industrial convergence and integration are commonplace, significant changes are expected in vocational ability required for a college student. The need for multi- and interdisciplinary research is increasing rapidly. Now is the time for pursuing reconstruction of the college education to change it into a real liberal arts education.The nature of the liberal arts education contains ‘heaving up of haman values.’ The value of the liberal arts education to save humanity should be more firmly observed in a situation which the dignity of human rights falls to the ground and the humanity is threatened by terrorism and war. This article examined the American liberal arts colleges and their applicabilities to the Korean college system. It was discussed that a K-LAC can provide alternatives to solve the urgent problem of the college education: the collapse of basic sciences and the lack of future academic generations.The first task for the Korean LAC is a structural reform of the college education toward an ‘open academic system.’ If the existing department structure interferes the flexible academic system, it should be transformed immediately. Suggestions on the transformation into the Korean LAC are as follows: First, professors should be assigned to an academic system in accordance with their department, but students do not need to belong to a certain department and should be allowed to do their study freely. Second, the core of liberal arts education lies in only ‘enhanced quality’ of such education based on the performance and recent academic trends of basic sciences. In this regard, the development of the core curriculum as a common curriculum will be necessary. Third, colleges need to help students study what they really want to do in the campus. It means that ‘liberal learning’ should be literally implemented in the college education."
Nuclear analysis of structural damage and nuclear heating on enhanced K-DEMO divertor model,2017,,,"<P>This paper addresses nuclear analysis on the Korean fusion demonstration reactor (K-DEMO) divertor to estimate the overall trend of nuclear heating values and displacement damages. The K-DEMO divertor model was created and converted by the CAD (Pro-Engineer<SUP>™</SUP>) and Monte Carlo automatic modeling programs as a 22.5° sector of the tokamak. The Monte Carlo neutron photon transport and ADVANTG codes were used in this calculation with the FENDL-2.1 nuclear data library. The calculation results indicate that the highest values appeared on the upper outboard target (OT) area, which means the OT is exposed to the highest radiation conditions among the three plasma-facing parts (inboard, central and outboard) in the divertor. Especially, much lower nuclear heating values and displacement damages are indicated on the lower part of the OT area than others. These are important results contributing to thermal-hydraulic and thermo-mechanical analyses on the divertor and also it is expected that the copper alloy materials may be partially used as a heat sink only at the lower part of the OT instead of the reduced activation ferritic-martensitic steel due to copper alloy’s high thermal conductivity.</P>"

The KLIWC as a word counting program was adopted to analyze the psychological/linguistic components of suicidal notes respectively. As a result, overall, both function and content words in U.S. suicidal notes were more likely to be appeared than in Korean suicidal notes. However, the specific words related to human, family and bond are more likely to be occurred in Korean suicidal notes. In particular, cognitive constraints in psychological domain such as limitation and restriction as well as negatively emotional words were more prevalent in Korean suicidal notes. Among 40 words most appeared over both suicidal notes, guilty, family and death in Korean suicidal notes were more exposed, while self and conception of death itself in U.S. suicidal notes were more revealed. Based on the suicidal-schema analysis by means of factor analysis, five factors were identified in both suicidal notes. Factors in both countries were almost similar, but regret/repentance factor was uniquely differentiated from U.S. suicidal notes schemas."

Anderson의 “Imagined Communities” 이론을 설명 틀로 활용했다. 저자는 임진전쟁 전후로 있었던 의병의 출현, 한글의 사용, 전후 기념사업을 통해 자신의 논지를 증명하고자 시도했다. 義兵(Righteous Army)은 의무도 경험도 없지만 자발적으로 목숨을 걸고 전장에 나감으로써 義와 忠을 바탕으로 한 애국주의을 구현했으며, 조선이라는 상상의 공동체를 출현시켰다. 전쟁 중 他-민족을 배제하기 위한 방편으로 사용된 한글은 한자를 보완하는 위치로 위계가 상승하였다. 한글은 전쟁 중에 ‘민족적 성격’을 대표했다면, 전후에는 하위문화의 영역에서 조선인의 담론을 생산하고유통하는 수평적 공간을 탄생시켰다. 조선 정부는 광범위한 전후 기념사업을 추진하며 전쟁 기억의 국유화 작업을 진행하였다. 기억의 주된 목적은 애국주의였으며, 이에 대한 평가와 보상이 이뤄졌다. 조선은 임진전쟁의 기억을 통해 애국심을 공유하는 민족의 공간을 만들었다. 이렇게 저자는 임진전쟁 전후로 나타난 여러 징후들이, 조선 민족이 공유하는 “상상의 공동체”에 대한 증거임을 논증하고자 하였다. 저자가 이 책을 통해 논증하려 시도한 의병의 성격인 애국주의는 성리학적 가치인 義와 忠을 의미했다. 忠은 義에 기초한 가치였고, 義는 春秋義理에서 출발한 유교윤리였다. 中華 질서에 속해 있던 조선에서 義란 조선과 조선의 국왕을 넘어 중화와 天子에 대한 忠을 포함하는 보편적 가치였다. 이러한 인식은 저자가 분석한 招諭文과 檄書에서 그대로 드러난다. 또한 저자가 민족 형성의 조건으로 제시한 지속성, 일관성, 연결성의 측면에서 이 책의 논지를 검토하면, 의병이 가진 성격의 변천, 조선 후기 한글의 위상, 전후 기념사업의 본질이 변화하는 모습 등에서 저자가 제시한 조건을 충족하지 못하는 부분이 나타난다. 특히 조선 사회를 지배했던 ‘중화’의 성격을 규명하는 방식에 따라 저자가 제시한 논거들이 오히려 반례가 될 수 있다. 하지만 이 책에서는 중화의 성격을 명확히 규명하지 않았다. 이 책은 저자 Haboush의 遺稿로, 상당 부분이 未完結 상태로 남았다. 이런 이유로 저작의 완결성이 기대에 미치지 못하는 부분이 있을 수 있지만 저자가 던진 주제의식은 壬辰戰爭史는 물론 한국 및 동아시아를 연구하는 학계에 좋은 연구거리를 제공하였고, 임진전쟁을 소재로 한 연구 지평의 확대에도 공헌하였다고 평가할 수 있다.","The Imjin war and the Manchu war of 1636 shook the international politics surrounding the three countries of Choson, China, Japan of the East Asian countries. In China, Ming Dynasty was replaced by Qing, and even in Japan, the regime change occurred, but the Choson Dynasty which was at the center of the war continued in the Korean peninsula. Regarding this situation, JaHyun K. Haboush, the author of The Great East Asian War and Birth of Korean Nation, argued that a discourse of nation emerged on the Korean peninsula instead of regime change. This claim of applying the nation or the discourse of nation, which was mainly discussed in the modern period, to the pre-modern Korea was quite unusual. The author used B. Anderson s Imagined Communities theory to prove the discourse of nation that occurred in Choson before and after the Imjin War. The author proves his argument through the emergence of Righteous Army during the Imjin War, the use of Hangeul, and the postwar commemoration projects. The Righteous Army embodied the patriotism based on righteousness and loyalty of people who voluntarily risked their lives and left for the battlefield, even though they had no experience or duty to do so, and created the imagined community of Choson. Hangeul, which was used as a means to exclude the other nations during the war, rose to the complementary position of Chinese characters. If Hangeul had represented the national character during the war, it created in the postwar period a horizontal space that produced and circulated Korean discourses in the area of subculture. The Choson government promoted the nationalization of war memories by pursuing a wide range of postwar memorial projects. The main purpose to remember the war was to nourish patriotism by creating a space where people can share their patriotism. As such, the author argued that the various signs that appeared before and after the Imjin War were evidence of the imagined community shared by the Korean people. The patriotism, which is the character of the Righteous Army argued by the author through this book, meant honor and loyalty, which are the neo-Confucian values. Honor and loyalty were the ethics of Confucianism which had started from the warring states period in China with the philosophy of fidelity, and the object of execution of honor was the universal value including the loyalty to China and the Son of Heaven beyond the King of Choson. This perception is revealed in the exhortation letter and poem analyzed by the author. In addition, reviewing the arguments of this book in terms of sustainability, consistency, and connectivity presented by the author as conditions of national formation, there are certain elements that do not satisfy the conditions in the areas such as the transition of character of Righteous Army, the status of Korean language in the late Choson era and the change of essence in the post war memorial projects. Especially, there could be totally different results according to the way of how to characterize Sinocentrism that dominated Choson society. However, this book did not properly characterize the characteristics of ‘Sinocentrism’. This book was from unfinished manuscripts of Haboush and had been edited and published, thus her thoughts and intentions may not have been fully reflected. However, the subject consciousness thrown by the author was heavy enough to open a new chapter in the history of the Imjin war as well as the study of the Choson dynasty."

Statistical methods used for data analysis were frequencies, means, standard deviations and independent t-test. The results were as follows: 1) Boys of secure attachment type showed better cognitive capability in full scale IQ, verbal comprehension ability, perceptual reasoning ability and working memory ability compared to boys of the insecure attachment type. 2) There was no statistically significant difference in processing speed ability between secure and insecure attachment types. This study empirically showed the relationship between attachment types and cognitive abilities of middle childhood boys; processing speed ability, however, was not related to attachment type."

It was investigated that such basic mathematical system was expressed as the aesthetic forms of unification, climax, repetition, contrast, change and harmony, which mean again the dance effects of the fusion, enhancement, abundance, strength, new values, and harmony.  It was observed that through the combination of effort drive, aesthetic form and the dance effect, the final outcome of the physical expression that the dancer were delivered in 3 forms of communication of Letter, Image and Emoticon.  The elementary school is the primary educational institution that the children learn the linguistic symbols and the movement signs. By teaching the point choreography of the K-pop dance, of which popularity and immersion are high constantly through the dance and physical education class in the elementary school, the dancer by him/herself can learn the way of the physical expression to deliver the symbols. It is expected that this study can be utilized as the dance theoretical background required to develop the choreography of K-pop dance.

To validate WAMI in Korean, a total of 618 Korean employees (386 males, 232 females) were investigated for this study. All participants completed K-WAMI questionnaire. Reliability and validity was verified. Exploratory factor analysis was performed with 208 participants. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted with 207 participants and it supported the three factors structure of K-WAMI, which was the same finding from the original scale. Also, the results from cross validation performed with 203 supported stable three-component structure. Configural invariance and measurement invariance were achieved with the new sample. Additionally, measurement invariance and latent mean difference between males and females were studied. Measurement invariance between males and females were supported and females showed the lower 'meaning in work' level than males. In conclusion, K-WAMI has been validated and is expected to be used as a psychometrically robust instrument in the future studies. Finally, implications and limitations of the present study and the suggestion for the future research were discussed."

This study analyzed the poem with a focus on dadaism, expressionism, futurism andsurrealism on the basis of the stylistic features of avant-garde literature established by Zoltán Szabó and Géza Vasy.First, the poem is most strikingly characterized by meaningless vocabulary that shows only phonetic features without semantic rationality. Such vocabulary does not simply derive from pun or fun, but reveals the essence of the timeswhen artistic rationality and value system collapsed completely. Second, the poem uses exclamations and exaggerative words, such as roppant, nagy, tele, óriás, világ and minden, and metaphors and symbols so frequently as to prevent the understanding of poetic meanings. They are expressionistic features that represent the fear for war, the destruction of reason and the inner confusion of mankind. Third, the poem often shows simultaneity and dynamics, which are the greatest features of futurism. Specifically, events sometimes occur in disorderand mixture in different times and spaces, and emotional shouts, imitative words, or exclamations are frequently employed. Lastly, the poem has surrealistic features: fantasies or dreams are artfully mixed with realities, with many scenes intentionally disturbing consciousness through unconsciousness; the narrator s consciousness hovers between reality and fantasy by the medium of specific words, e.g. conjunction like de."

I arouse my curiosity about how K-pop dance is re-rendered in Malaysia where Islam is adopted the state religion but various religions and cultures co-exist, called the multicultural and multiconfessional nation.What is noticeable here is that the Malaysian government countenances cultural opening by policy, which allows the younger generation to open their mind to K-pop dance music and to be accustomed to producing dance covers in their own bodies.This article explores why the youth turn away their eyes to K-pop dance choreography as much as song tunes and lyrics. It also enables me to look over what their own meanings they dissolve into dance covers. This research makes clear that dance is seen as a global communication medium beyond religious and cultural barriers when being transmitted from one country to another."

In this study, we report the baseline characteristics of this retrospective cohort.Subjects and Methods: In the present study we analyzed datasets of 3073 patients with 3972 target limbs from a retrospective cohort treated with endovascular therapy in 31 Korean hospitals. Data regarding patient baseline clinical and lesion characteristics and postintervention medications were collected from electronic medical records.Results: The mean patient age was 68.3±9.4 years. The majority were male (82.1%) with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus (58.0%), hypertension (73.4%), and coronary artery disease (CAD; 55.3%). Patients more commonly presented with intermittent claudication (66.3%) than with critical limb ischemia (CLI; 33.7%). Femoropopliteal artery (41.2%) was the most common target vessel for endovascular treatment, followed by the aortoiliac (35.6%) and infrapopliteal arteries (23.2%).

However, surgical intervention is required for patients with advanced Kümmell disease accompanied by neurologic deficit.Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 22 neurologically compromised patients with advanced Kümmell disease who were treated surgically at Ewha Womans Hospital between January 2011 and January 2014. The surgical approach used by us was a posterior vertebrectomy with mesh cage insertion and segmental cement-augmented pedicle screw fixation. The tissue from the corpectomy was histopathologically examined. Anterior vertebral height, kyphotic angle, visual analog scale (VAS) score, and the Frankel classification were used to evaluate the efficacy of the procedure.Results: The mean follow-up period was 26 months (range, 13–40 months). VAS score, anterior vertebral height, kyphotic angle, and neurologic state were significantly improved immediately postoperatively and at the last follow-up compared with preoperatively (p <0.05). Most patients exhibited intravertebral clefts on imaging, and postoperative pathology revealed bone necrosis.Conclusions: Posterior vertebrectomy with mesh cage insertion and segmental cement-augmented pedicle screw fixation is an effective approach for treating patients with advanced Kümmell disease with neurologic deficit."

In PWD, when a high current is passed through high-density metal wires, the wires explode because of resistance heating, forming fine particles or metal vapor. In this study, we used Sn-Bi and Ag wires in order to obtain three-component nanopowders. A high current was applied to the wires between the electrodes in a N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. We discussed the results based on the K factor, which is the ratio of the charging energy of the capacitor to the vaporization energy of the wire. The three-component (Sn-Bi-Ag) nanoparticles were synthesized under a N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere at 4 and 6 kV. From the particle-size distribution curves, it was found that the mean particle diameter (D<sub>1</sub>) values of the Sn-Bi and Ag nanopowders were within the range of 16.32-42.37 nm under each condition. The melting point of the Sn-Bi-Ag nanoparticles was found to be within the range of 188.68-214.97 ℃, which is about 40 ℃ lower than that obtained from the phase diagram and computational thermodynamics of the Sn-Bi-Ag system. In this study, the nanopowders were obtained by subjecting the wires at extreme energies, to improve their solid solubility. (Received February 8, 2017; Accepted July 26, 2017)"

The West early recognized generation problem as the fundamental problem of pedagogy. Schleiermacher who was German philosopher, theologist, and pedagogist indicated the fundamental problem of pedagogy was the problem, if the value of the older generation and maintenance of culture must be recognized as the core of new generation education or new generation education must focus on the improvement of tradition pursued by the older generation rather than its maintenance. However, the discussion about generation in pedagogy excluded the discussion about ‘what is generation and how is it organized?’. Mannheim sociologically showed the problems of generation and its organization. Therefore, this study firstly will analyze and suggest generation theory such as Mannheim’s generation and generation unit, etc., and connect Mannheim’s generation theory to learning habitus concept that reorganized Bourdieu’s habitus concept critically. The purpose of the trial is to reorganize sociological discussion about generation to pedagogical discussion about generation. Based on it, this study intends to suggest theoretical analysis frame that can be utilized andragogically. In conclusion, generation problem is pedagogically very significant from largely two angles. First, from an angle of the study on learners, it can provide practical foundation of adult education by adult learners’ characteristics of each generation or each generation unit. Second, from an angle of lifelong education’s tasks, it can prepare the approach that can solve generational differences and conflicts, our country faces now."

The first phase was to translate and cross-culturally adapt the CRBS to the Korean language. After back-translation, both versions were reviewed by a committee. The face validity was assessed in a sample of Korean patients (n=53) with history of acute myocardial infarction that did not participate in CR through semi-structured interviews. The second phase was to assess the construct and criterion validity of the Korean translation as well as internal reliability, through administration of the translated version in 104 patients, principle component analysis with varimax rotation and cross-referencing against CR use, respectively.Results The length, readability, and clarity of the questionnaire were rated well, demonstrating face validity. Analysis revealed a six-factor solution, demonstrating construct validity. Cronbach’s alpha was greater than 0.65. Barriers rated highest included not knowing about CR and not being contacted by a program. The mean CRBS score was significantly higher among non-attendees (2.71±0.26) than CR attendees (2.51±0.18) (p<0.01).Conclusion The Korean version of CRBS has demonstrated face, content and criterion validity, suggesting it may be useful for assessing barriers to CR utilization in Korea."

The model is inherently modelled as a large scale mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem and the computation time increases exponentially and intractable as the system size grows. To make the problem tractable, this paper proposes an EOH calculation based on demand grouping by K-means clustering algorithm.

Above all, inter-Asia movement of various cultural practices that crack the unilateral cultural flow between Western and non-Western countries are becoming visible, and thus the studies on this topic are being actively conducted. This study pays attention to the various practices of mobility of music and its practices in contemporary Asia that takes place along with the transnational flow of population and capital. It examines the process of mobility of K-musials, Korean musicals to other parts of Asia after , focusing on the practice of K-musicals in Japan and examining its multi-layered characteristics and meanings. Korean musicals are global cultural products, which have imitated, appropriated, and interpreted American Broadway shows, and at the same time regional and hybrid cultural forms which have been transformed based on Korean discourse, production subject, capital, and market specificity. Since the mid-2000s, Korean musicals, that began in the 1960s, have moved to Asia, associated with cultural capital of hallyu. Hallyu, as an another local variant, is another cultural phenomena of transnational consumption of Korean popular culture. This study examines the production and consumption of K-musicals, which originated from the point where two cultural variants-Korean musicals and hallyu-meet. Korean musicals introduced in the 1960s through the United States have continued to be concerned about Korean identity and indigenization in relation to musicals that were power outages before. Above all, they have been ""Koreanized"" in a specific way in the frames of nationalism and globalization derived from national interest. These Koreanized musicals have emerged as cultural industry contents with the national support through the participation of large corporations and incorporation into global cultural industries. The intervention of hallyu cultural capital in the world of musicals, which is globally successful, has converted the system by making idols participate in musicals or transforming the primary hallyu contents into musicals. In this process, the participation of hallyu fandom in musicals has been crucial to visualize the movement of Korean musicals in Asia, and the Korean musicals are transformed into hallyu contents through the titles of K-musicals or Hallyu musicals. Before the 2000s, Korean musicals, which were performed intermittently in Japan, began to perform actively along with hallyu boom in Japan in mid-2000s; a variety of Korean booms have occurred since 2012. This includes musicals with diverse characteristics ranging from idol musicals, drama-cals using hallyu contents, and movie-cals to small scale creative Korean musicals. K-musicals in Japan are been gradually escalated and sophisticated due to the complexity of cultural and discursive factors based on the industrial and physical foundations of Korean-Japanese musicals, such as the Korean Wave in Japan, the willingness of exchanges in the world of Korea-Japan musicals, and the transformation into global industry. Furthermore, as K-musicals in Japan have been stagnating since 2014, the interest of K-musicals is shifting to China and other Asian regions. K-musical, which was born through the standardization of the style of musical in globalized period and the symbol Korea, is granted with its own value and position in the global market by acquiring the label K, or the global distinct brand, and further producing the authority and the justification in its moving to Asia."

The artificial bee colony (ABC) is an algorithm motivated by the intelligent behavior exhibited by honeybees when searching for food. The performance of ABC is better than or similar to other population-based algorithms with the added advantage of employing fewer control parameters. Our proposed CABC method is able to provide near optimal solution within reasonable time to balance the converged and diversified searches. In this paper, the experiment and analysis of clustering problems demonstrate that CABC is a competitive approach comparing to previous partitioning approaches in satisfactory results with respect to solution quality. We validate the performance of CABC using Iris, Wine, Glass, Vowel, and Cloud UCI machine learning repository datasets comparing to previous studies by experiment and analysis.

Simulated annealing (SA) is useful for diversified search in large search space and K-means is useful for converged search in predetermined search space. Our proposed method can balance the intensification and diversification to find the global optimal solution in big data clustering. The performance of HSA is validated using Iris, Wine, Glass, and Vowel UCI machine learning repository datasets comparing to previous studies by experiment and analysis. Our proposed KSAK (K-means+SA+K-means) and SAK (SA+K-means) are better than KSA(K-means+SA), SA, and K-means in our simulations. Our method has significantly improved accuracy and efficiency to find the global optimal data clustering solution for complex, real time, and costly data mining process."
Combined Artificial Bee Colony for Data Clustering,2017,"['Data Clustering', 'Combined Artificial Bee Colony (CABC)', 'K-means']",,"Data clustering is one of the most difficult and challenging problems and can be formally considered as a particular kind of NP-hard grouping problems. The K-means algorithm is one of the most popular and widely used clustering method because it is easy to implement and very efficient. However, it has high possibility to trap in local optimum and high variation of solutions with different initials for the large data set. Therefore, we need study efficient computational intelligence method to find the global optimal solution in data clustering problem within limited computational time. The objective of this paper is to propose a combined artificial bee colony (CABC) with K-means for initialization and finalization to find optimal solution that is effective on data clustering optimization problem. The artificial bee colony (ABC) is an algorithm motivated by the intelligent behavior exhibited by honeybees when searching for food. The performance of ABC is better than or similar to other population-based algorithms with the added advantage of employing fewer control parameters. Our proposed CABC method is able to provide near optimal solution within reasonable time to balance the converged and diversified searches. In this paper, the experiment and analysis of clustering problems demonstrate that CABC is a competitive approach comparing to previous partitioning approaches in satisfactory results with respect to solution quality. We validate the performance of CABC using Iris, Wine, Glass, Vowel, and Cloud UCI machine learning repository datasets comparing to previous studies by experiment and analysis. Our proposed KABCK (K-means+ABC+K-means) is better than ABCK (ABC+K-means), KABC (K-means+ABC), ABC, and K-means in our simulations."

Previous studies have mainly analyzed young driver's aggressive driving tendency, yet they were only done through pure clustering or classification technique of machine learning. However, since elderly people have different driving habits due to their fragile physical conditions, it is necessary to develop a new method such as enhancing the characteristics of driving data to properly analyze aggressive driving of elderly drivers. In this study, acceleration data collected from a smartphone of a driving vehicle is analyzed by a newly proposed ECA(Enhanced Clustering method for Acceleration data) technique, coupled with a conventional clustering technique (K-means Clustering, Expectation-maximization algorithm). ECA selects high-intensity data among the data of the cluster group detected through K-means and EM in all of the subjects' data and models the characteristic data through the scaled value. Using this method, the aggressive driving data of all youth and elderly experiment participants were collected, unlike the pure clustering method. We further found that the K-means clustering has higher detection efficiency than EM method. Also, the results of K-means clustering demonstrate that a young driver has a driving strength 1.29 times higher than that of an elderly driver. In conclusion, the proposed method of our research is able to detect aggressive driving maneuvers from data of the elderly having low operating intensity. The proposed method is able to construct a customized safe driving system for the elderly driver. In the future, it will be possible to detect abnormal driving conditions and to use the collected data for early warning to drivers."

The display devices should be able to provide object-based image information when a depthmap is required. In this paper, we representthe algorithm using a histogram-based image segmentation method for depthmap generation. In the conventional K-means clustering algorithm, the number of centroids is parameterized, so existing K-means algorithms cannot adaptively determine the number of clusters. Further, the problem of K-means algorithm tends to sink into the local minima, which causes over-segmentation. On the other hand, the proposed algorithm is adaptively able to select centroids and can stand on the basis of the histogram-based algorithm considering the amount of computational complexity. It is designed to show object-based results by preventing the existing algorithm from falling into the local minimum point. Finally, we remove the over-segmentation components through connected-component labeling algorithm. The results of proposed algorithm show object-based results and better segmentation results of 0.017 and 0.051, compared to the benchmark method in terms of Probabilistic Rand Index(PRI) and Segmentation Covering(SC), respectively."

The SC images were obtained by taking pictures in a box under controlled light conditions. The region of interest was extracted to depict the shape of the SC in a 2D graph, and those 2D shapes were rendered to build a 3D model. The results from the image analysis provided the morphological features of the SC, including length, width, surface area, and volume, to obtain the parameters of the k-mean clustering weight. The k-mean clustering classified the SC samples into three different grades. Each SC sample was rehydrated at 30°C for 40 h. During rehydration, the flux of each grade was analyzed. Our study demonstrates that the mass transfer rate of SC increased as the surface area increased, and the grade of SC was classified based on rehydration rate. This study suggests that the optimal rehydration process for SC can be achieved by applying a suitable grading system."

METHODS: First, road snow-removal historical data from the road snow-removal management system (RSMS), operated by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, were employed to determine specific characteristics of the snow-removal capabilities by region. The actual owned amount and actual used amount of infrastructure were analyzed for the past three years. Second, the regional offices were classified using K-means clustering into groups “close”to one another. Actual used snow-removal infrastructure was determined from the number of snow-removal working days. Finally, the correlation between the de-icing materials used and infrastructure was analyzed. Significant differences were found among the amounts of used infrastructure depending on snowfall intensity for each regional office during the past three years. RESULTS: The results showed that the amount of snow-removal infrastructure used for low heavy-snowfall intensity did not appear to depend on the amount of heavy snowfall, and therefore, high variation is observed in each area. CONCLUSIONS: This implies that the final analysis results will be useful when making decisions on snow-removal works."

Particularly, Chapter 8 shows interdependence of Agent (kāraka) and Act (karman) extending to all beings, and the concrete example of this expansion is Action of “upādāna”. Therefore, a clear analysis of a structure of “Action of upādāna-Agent-Act” could be a useful model to understand “pratyayatā” of the MMK.As is known, however, because the word “karman” means not only Act but also an object, it is difficult to determine the meaning of “karman” accurately through the verses of the MMK. Therefore, the interpretation of “pratyayatā” in Chap. 8 should be begun with determining the meaning of “karman” through commentaries of the MMK.This determination is important because the relationship of Agent-Act in Chap. 8 extends to “upādāna”, and considering the meaning of the “karman” leads to the analysis of the meaning of the “upādāna” which has multiple meanings itself.In other words, since the examination of the meaning of “karman” leads to the analysis of “upādāna”, the precedence of this review makes the theoretical structure of “pratyayatā” more clear.However, previous studies have not clearly defined the meaning of “karman”, and seems to regard “upādāna” as a simple example of expansion. So they do not show a comprehension of both “karman” and “upādāna”.Therefore, I will consider the meaning of ""pratyayatā"" through the meaning analysis of ""upādāna"" and ""karman"" based on the commentary of Chap. 8 of the MMK."

First, we set the Abbe-König prism design variables and derive the relational expressions between them. With this expressions, we could develope the program that outputs the numerical data for the Abbe-König prism design and three evaluation data for the Abbe-König prism analysis when the face-length, the effective convergent incident angle of incident beam, and the refraction index of prism are given. In fact, applying this program to the prism which is not the commercial size, we were able to calculate the design data very quickly, and we could easily understand the optical structure of the designed Abbe-König prism by the three evaluation data. This means that we can quickly ensure the structural data of the Abbe-König prism which is required for the product development."
A Prediction Method for Short-Term Wind Power Generation using Feature Vector Extraction of Wind Direction and Wind Speed in Jeju Island,2017,"['전력발전량예측', '풍향', '풍속', 'K-means clustering', 'SVR', 'SVM', 'Forecasting of Wind Power Generation', 'Wind Direction', 'Wind Speed', 'K-means clustering', 'SVR', 'SVM']",,"In this paper, we propose a wind power forecasting method that takes into consideration wind characteristics to improve the accuracy of wind power prediction. The proposed method involves extracting wind characteristics and predicting power generation. Correlation analysis of power generation amount, wind direction, and wind speed is performed for extracting wind characteristics. Based on the correlation between the wind direction and the wind speed, the feature vector is extracted by clustering using the K-means method. In the prediction part, machine learning is performed using the SVR (support vector regression) that generalizes the SVM (support vector machine) so that an arbitrary real value can be predicted. To verify the accuracy and feasibility of the proposed method, we used the data collected from three different locations of the Jeju Island wind farm. Experimental results show that the error of the proposed method is better than that of existing wind power generation methods."

The previous lasso tool has a disadvantage that the start point and the end point must be connected. However, the proposed lasso tool has the advantage of selecting the region of interest without connecting the start point and the end point. We can automatically obtain various results of backlight compensation by adjusting the number of k-means clusters for texture extraction and the threshold value for binarization."

Methods: A total of 30 participants with the normal color vision (mean age 24.70±1.86 years) were tested the FM 100 hue test under LED lightings of 3,000 K or 6,500 K while wearing four different color glasses. The abilities of color perception were analyzed with the averages of TES(total error score) and ES charts(error score charts) from FM 100 hue test(Farnsworth Munsell 100 hue test). Results: Regardless of whether color lenses are weared or not, the averages of TES of the FM 100 hue test under LED lighting of either 3,000 K or 6,500 K showed no significant difference statistically. However in comparison to the averages under LED lightings between 3,000 K and 6,500 K, the averages of TES under LED lighting of 6,500 K were found to be significantly larger than those under LED lighting of 3,000 K. According to the ES chart, the values of ES under LED lighting of 6,500 K were larger than those under lightings of 3,000 K in some color segments. Conclusions: Under LED lighting of either 3,000 K or 6,500 K, because the color lenses of brown, green, red and gray with transmittance of about 50% to 60% did not affect the color perception, it is thought that there is no major problem with prescription and wearing. However it is recommended to pay attention to prescription and wearing since the change of CCT of LED lightings between 3,000 K and 6,500 K affect the color perception. In the case of the FM 100 hue test, the ES chart may be suitable for use as an indicator to clarify the errors of color discrimination in each color that can not be detected by the average of TES."

However, it is not easy to fit right sitting posture for long periods of time. Therefore, methods of distinguishing and inducing good sitting posture have been constantly proposed. Proposed methods were image processing, using pressure sensor attached to the chair, and using the IMU (Internal Measurement Unit). The method of using IMU has advantages of simple hardware configuration and free of various constraints in measurement. In this paper, we researched on distinguishing sitting postures with a small amount of data using just one IMU. Feature extraction method was used to find data which contribution is the least for classification. Machine learning algorithms were used to find the best position to classify and we found best machine learning algorithm. Used feature extraction method was PCA(Principal Component Analysis). Used Machine learning models were five : SVM(Support Vector Machine), KNN(K Nearest Neighbor), K-means (K-means Algorithm) GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model), and HMM (Hidden Marcov Model). As a result of research, back neck is suitable position for classification because classification rate of it was highest in every model. It was confirmed that Yaw data which is one of the IMU data has the smallest contribution to classification rate using PCA and there was no changes in classification rate after removal it. SVM, KNN are suitable for classification because their classification rate are higher than the others."
실루엣을 적용한 그룹탐색 최적화 데이터클러스터링,2017,"['Group Search Optimization', 'Data Clustering', 'Number of Clusters', 'Silhouette']",,K-means is a popular and efficient data clustering method that only uses intra-cluster distance to establish a valid index with a previously fixed number of clusters. K-means is useless without a suitable number of clusters for unsupervised data. This paper aimsto propose the Group Search Optimization (GSO) using Silhouette to find the optimal data clustering solution with a number of clusters for unsupervised data. Silhouette can be used as valid index to decide the number of clusters and optimal solution by simultaneously considering intra- and inter-cluster distances. The performance of GSO using Silhouette is validated through several experiment and analysis of data sets.

This essay consists of a brief analysis of Kāmasūtra 1.1 and 1.2, with the aim of clarifying the way in which the text carefully asserts its own divine (apauruṣeya) origins as a means of establishing a religious sanction for a treatise on erotics, even as it affirms its human (pauruṣeya) provenance and the authorship of Vātsyāyana. In insisting upon the human, and thus necessarily fallible, aspect of śāstra, Vātsyāyana nevertheless implicitly claims for himself the authority to recover the original meaning śāstra, and adjudicate its ambiguities. This distinction between the divine origins and human provenance of śāstra is thus resolved in the figure of the master (ācārya), and in the related concept of “mastery” (pratipatti)."

For this task, I have explored various metaphoric meanings that Schenker`s prolongation poses through a literature review and provided brief analytic discourses in which such metaphors of the prolongation bring about vivid verbal descriptions based on the human`s experience by means of what Steve Larson calls musical forces; and I have looked into how the prolongational modalities as seen in first phrases excerpted from the second movement of Mozart`s piano sonata K. 545 and the first movement of Beethoven`s piano sonata Op. 26 have been embodied and expressed in selected pianists` legendary recordings.Not only subtle alternation between ritardando and a tempo by determination of a cadence, delicate accentuation control of structural notes by recognition of either a motive or Urlinie members, and strategical emphasis on a transferred note from an inner voice by a deep and strong touch, but also a temporal manipulation near at new harmonic domains are natural outputs of a learned performer`s informed intuition. This study has pursued illuminating the interdependent relationship between analysis and performance instead of digging up a long debate of whether a diplomatic performance is achieved by intuition or thorough analysis."

So the word-order has no meaning, except in special cases.However, in case of a compound (samāsa) that consists of a semantic combination of a word (pada) and a word, there is a posterior relationship that can be called a word order between the constituents. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the word-order relation of compound constituents in terms of  Pūrvanipāta  and ‘Upasarjana’.Pāṇini defined more than 100 grammatical rules related to the compound in Aṣṭādhyāyī. Of these, the rules governing the word-order in relation to the above concepts are given in P. 2.2.30-P. 2.2.38. According to these rules, the word-order of the constituents of a compound is basically determined by the operation in grammar (Kārya) of Upasarjana, which is called Pūrvanipāta. Upasarjana is a name (Saṁjñā) for those that will be presented as a prathamā-vibhakti in all the Compound-rules (Samāsa-śāstra), and has the feature of preceding in order in a compound. This name is also closely related to the ‘relation of predicate and subject’ (Viśeṣaṇa-viśeṣya-bhāva), because it also implies Guṇa, i.e., apradhāna, in terms of etymology. So it precedes in order in a compound. While the above rules have a restrictive effect on a compound by ‘apūrvanipāta’ and ‘paranipāta’, it is confirmed that such restrictions also act optionally.As a result, it has been confirmed that the positional relationship of the compound constituents is also controlled by the intention of the Speaker (Vivakṣā).The review of the rules on word-order can be meaningful for the analysis of compounds that are unlikely to be understood without the help of the annotations."
A neural network based approach for background noise reduction in airborne acoustic emission of a machining process,2017,"['Acoustic emission', 'Machining process', 'Noise', 'Machine learning', 'Neural network', 'Tool condition monitoring']",,"Tool wear prediction has become an indispensable technique to prevent downtime in manufacturing and production processes.Airborne emission from a machining process using a low-cost microphone may provide a vital signal of tool health. However, the effect of background noise results in anomaly in data that may lead to wrong prediction of tool health. The paper presents an adaptive approach using neural networks for background noise filtration in acoustic signal for a turning process. Acoustic signal of a turning process is mixed with background noise from four different machines and introduced at different RPMs and feed-rate at a constant depth of cut. A comparison of Backpropagation neural network (BPNN), Self-organizing map and k-means clustering algorithm for noise filtration is investigated in this paper. In this regard, back-propagation neural network showed better performance with an average accuracy for all the four sources. It shows 100 % accuracy for grinding machine signal, 94.78 % accuracy for background signal from 3-axis milling machine, 45.57 % and 12.69 % for motor and 4-axis milling machine, respectively. Signal reconstruction is then done using Discrete cosine transform (DCT). The proposed technique shows a promising future for noise filtration in airborne acoustic data of a machining process."
Korean Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System features of follicular thyroid adenoma and carcinoma: a single-center study,2017,"['Thyroid nodule', 'K-TIRADS', 'Thyroid cancer', 'follicular', 'Ultrasonography', 'Neoplasms']",,"Purpose: This study aimed to assess the diagnostic efficacy of Korean Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (K-TIRADS) features for distinguishing follicular thyroid adenoma (FTA) from follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC).Methods: From January 2013 to July 2016, 46 follicular neoplasms in 45 patients who underwent preoperative thyroid ultrasonography (US) and thyroid surgery were included. The US features of each thyroid nodule were retrospectively evaluated by a single radiologist using a picture archiving and communication system. The diagnostic indices of K-TIRADS for follicular neoplasms were calculated according to whether K-TIRADS category 4 lesions were excluded or classified as benign or malignant.Results: Of the 46 follicular neoplasms (mean size, 3.1±1.6 cm), 37 were FTAs (mean size, 3.1±1.7 cm) and nine were FTCs (mean size, 3.0±1.5 cm). A statistically significant difference was found between FTAs and FTCs regarding the margin (P=0.035), while no significant differences were observed in the composition, echogenicity, shape, orientation, calcification, or vascularity of the lesions (P<0.05). The FTAs belonged to K-TIRADS categories 3 (n=22) and 4 (n=15), while the FTCs belonged to K-TIRADS categories 3 (n=4), 4 (n=4), and 5 (n=1). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the distribution of K-TIRADS categories between FTAs and FTCs (P=0.184).Conclusion: K-TIRADS features were not helpful for distinguishing FTA from FTC, although follicular neoplasms showed a high prevalence of K-TIRADS categories 3 and 4."

Among the various performance indicators of thermal observation devices, such as the view, magnification, resolution, MTF, NETD, and Minimum Resolvable Temperature Difference (MRTD), the MRTD is the most important, because it can indicate both the spatial frequency and temperature resolvable. However, the standard method of measuring the MRTD in NATO contains many subjective factors. As the measurement result can vary depending on subjective factors such as the human eye, metal condition and measurement conditions, the MRTD obtained is not stable. In this study, these qualitative MRTD measurement systems are converted into quantitative indicators based on a gray scale using imaging processing. By converting the average of the gray scale differences of the black and white images into the MRTD, the mean values can be used to determine whether the performance requirements required by the defense specification are met. The (mean) value can also be used to discriminate between detection, recognition and identification and the detectable distance of the thermal equipment can be analyzed under various environmental conditions, such as altostratus, heavy rain and fog."

Generally speaking, the FinTech industry consists of start-up companies. Therefore, FinTech start-ups have offered new and fresh services at lower costs through well-designated platforms or mobile apps.Specifically, London becomes a FinTech hub in the world and there are lots of FinTech start-ups in UK. The UK government` policy has assisted and encouraged the FinTech industry. ZOPA is a world-famous P2P lending company.

Internet-only banks like MyBank & WeBank have already done business. Furthermore, P2P lending has greatly developed. One of the reasons of the rise of FinTech industry is insufficiency of function of state-owned banks. It is because small & medium corporations have difficulty in getting loan from state-owned banks. Of course, development of digital technologies has contributed to the growth of FinTech industry in China.The China Banking Regulatory Commission(CBRC) issued Rules on the Administration of Electronic Banking in 2006 and recently issued the Interim Measures for the Administration of the Business Activities of Online Lending Information Intermediary Institutions according to the development of FinTech industry.In Korea, K-Bank & Kakaobank as an internet-only bank are established and doing business.

This is connected to the principle of respect for accounting principles in the Basic Law for National Taxes. This attitude, however, could get feasibility when the acceptance of accounting principles does not violate the goal or the efficiency and equity guiding principles of tax law. Also, it needs to examine the effect of change of GAAP, from IAS 17 to IFRS 16, to the tax law.This paper tries to review the new standards, IFRS 16, and summarize the key factors and examine the influence to the tax burden when both IAS 17 and IFRS 16 are applied. The amorphous concepts for classifying lease type in IAS 17 could give it chance for transaction parties to manipulate their tax burden by tax strategies. That means that it would bring about the changes of tax revenue. Also IFRS 16 would allow to change tax burdens by lease classification.There is no answer about what legal effect should be given to lease transaction in tax law because it is not possible to draw a clear line between rental and financing for acquiring assets. Thus, what to do with lease transaction in tax law belongs to tax policy, and there would be few solutions for classifying lease transaction."

III장에서는 체계적으로 연대개념이 소환된 영역들을 분류하고 오늘날에도 여전히 연대 가능성이 높은 장소는 어디인지바이예르츠(K. Bayertz)의 글을 중심으로 검토한다. 그는현대를 자신의 이익과 가치를 우선시 하는 개인주의 문화로 보고, 사회를 현상적으로 파악하는 사회학적 방법론을 가지고 영역들을 검토하고 있다. 바이예르츠는 1.도덕철학적-형이상학적 개념으로서의 연대, 2. 사회적 통합으로서의 연대, 3. 해방투쟁의 수단과 목적으로서의 연대, 4. 복지국가의 연대 등 네 가지로 분류하여 분석하고있다. 그에 의하면 이기적 인간을 전제로 하는 현대사회에서도 여전히 의미 있는 효력을 발생하는 연대성은 뒤르켕이 지적한 ‘유기적 연대’와 생태, 여성, 장애인, 동성애자 등 역사적 진보와 해방을 기다리며 저항하는 까뮈의 ‘저항연대’ 정도이다. III장 소결(4)에서는 Bayertz의 한계를 지적하고 윤리학적, 형이상학적 인간 이해로 연대가능성을 보충해야 한다는 점을 밝힌다. IV장 결론부분에서 연대 가능성을 형이상학, 역사학, 윤리학, 정치학 등통합적 시각에서 인격성, 연대성, 보조성을 추구하는 가톨릭 사회론의 입장을 중심으로 대안으로 제시한다. 이를 통해 연대는 사회적 본성을 지닌 인간의 의무이자 특히 종교공동체, 특히 그리스도교의 사명이라는 점이 부각될 것이다.","Solidarity (Solidaritaet, solidaritas) generally means an attitude or activity for the purpose of a community as a whole or for that of a worthy person or persons acting within their legal rights who are threatened. In the first part of this paper, we look at how the concept of solidarity has been used and developed historically in the traditions of Korea and Germany. In the second part, we use Bayertz ' writings, systematically to classify areas where the concept of solidarity is used and examines the possibilities of today’s solidarity. Bayertz considers these days’ culture as an individualist culture that prioritizes one’s own interests and values, and he uses sociological methodologies to examine areas of society and try to understand it phenomenologically. Bayertz divides the solidarity into four uses: 1. moral philosophical-metaphysical concept of solidarity, 2. solidarity as social unity, 3. solidarity as means and purpose of liberation struggle, 4.solidarity of welfare states. I would like to review Bayertz’s four conceptions of solidarity and its possibility. According to him, solidarity, which has meaningful effects still in the modern society presupposed by selfish human beings, is the ""organic solidarity"" of Duerkheim and the revolte solidarity of Camus. Part 2 sheds light on the limitations of Bayertz’ ideas and suggests that the possibility of solidarity must be supplemented by ethical and metaphysical human understanding. In the conclusion, we present an alternative viewpoint, that of Catholic social theory concerning the pursuit of personal dignity, solidarity, and subsidiarity in an integrated view in terms of metaphysics, history, ethics, and politics. The conclusion will present the basis of the proposition that solidarity is a duty of humanity and a mission of Christianity."

So the word-order has no meaning, except in special cases. However, in case of a compound (samāsa) that consists of a semantic combination of a word (pada) and a word, there is a posterior relationship that can be called a word order between the constituents. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the word-order relation of compound constituents in terms of 'Pūrvanipāta' and ‘Upasarjana’.Pāṇini defined more than 100 grammatical rules related to the compound in Aṣṭādhyāyī. Of these, the rules governing the word-order in relation to the above concepts are given in P. 2.2.30-P. 2.2.38. According to these rules, the word-order of the constituents of a compound is basically determined by the operation in grammar (Kārya) of Upasarjana, which is called Pūrvanipāta. Upasarjana is a name (Saṁjñā) for those that will be presented as a prathamā-vibhakti in all the Compound-rules (Samāsa-śāstra), and has the feature of preceding in order in a compound. This name is also closely related to the ‘relation of predicate and subject’ (Viśeṣaṇa-viśeṣya-bhāva), because it also implies Guṇa, i.e., apradhāna, in terms of etymology. So it precedes in order in a compound. While the above rules have a restrictive effect on a compound by ‘apūrvanipāta’ and ‘paranipāta’, it is confirmed that such restrictions also act optionally.As a result, it has been confirmed that the positional relationship of the compound constituents is also controlled by the intention of the Speaker (Vivakṣā). The review of the rules on word-order can be meaningful for the analysis of compounds that are unlikely to be understood without the help of the annotations."
Behavior of Temperature-Dependent DC-Photoconductivity in Hot-Wall Deposited CaAl2Se4 Layers,2017,"['CaAl2Se4', 'Photocurrent', 'Temperature dependence', 'Band gap', 'Valence-band splitting', 'Characterization']",,"The dc-photoconductive characteristic on the hot-wall grown CaAl2Se4 (CAS) layers was explored as a function of temperature. From the photocurrent (PC) measurement, three PC peaks A, B, and C corresponded to the intrinsic transitions, which represent the band-to-band transitions from the valence-band states of 2(A), 3 + 4(B), and 3 + 4(C) to the conduction-band state of 1, respectively. Based on these PC results, the optical band-gap energy was well matched by Eg(T) = Eg(0) − 4.94 × 10−3T2/(T + 552), where Eg(0) is found to be 3.8239, 3.8716, and 3.8801 eV for three peaks A, B, and C, respectively. Thus, the effect of the crystal field and spin-orbit splitting (These values were extracted out to be 47.7 and 8.5 meV, respectively.) was observed and calculated by means of the PC spectroscopy. However, PC intensity gradually decreased with decreasing temperature unlike an ordinary behavior. In the log Jph vs 1/T plot, two dominant traplevels were observed to be 20.81 meV at temperatures of 300 - 70 K and 1.18 meV at temperatures below 70 K. Consequently, we extract out that these trapping centers caused by native defects in CAS confine the PC intensity as temperature decreases."

Components of ERB are the historical character as contents, rap battle as a form, and UCC as a method. The expressive character of ERB is 'playfulness' as vernacular and play culture of adolescent. Basis on the humor theory of Bergson, the analysis framework for playfulness of ERB is developed. And then, 4 pieces of K-ERB are analyzed by this frame. The results, K-ERB is less playful and resistant but more educational than other ERB genre. Restrained playfulness and educational usefulness will open up the new possibility of speech education.

Methods: Questionnaires were distributed to 300 university students randomly selected in Gongju. Dietary survey was administered during two weekdays by the food record method. Results: Subjects were divided into three groups: NCG (non-coffee group), LCG (low coffee group, 1~2 cups/d), and HCG (high coffee group, 3 cups/d) by coffee intake amount and subjects"" distribution. Coffee intake frequency was significantly greater in the HCG compared to the LCG (p < 0.001). The HCG was more likely to intake dripped coffee with or without milk and/or sugar than the LCG (p < 0.05). More than 80% of coffee drinkers chose their favorite coffee or accompanying snacks regardless of energy content. More than 75% of coffee takers did not eat accompanying snacks instead of meals, and the HCG ate them more frequently than LCG (p < 0.05). Breakfast skipping rate was high while vegetable and fruit intakes were very low in most subjects. Subjects who drank carbonated drinks, sweet beverages, or alcohol were significantly greater in number in the LCG and HCG than in the NCG (p < 0.01). Energy intakes from coffee were 0.88 ± 5.62 kcal/d and 7.07 ± 16.93 kcal/d for the LCG and HCG. For total subjects, daily mean dietary energy intake was low at less than 72% of estimated energy requirement. Levels of vitamin C and calcium were lower than the estimated average requirements while that of vitamin D was low (24~34% of adequate intake). There was no difference in nutrient intakes by coffee intake amount, except protein, vitamin A, and niacin. Conclusion: Coffee intake amount did not affect dietary nutrient intakes. Dietary habits were poor, and most nutrient intakes were lower than recommend levels. High intakes of coffee seemed to be related with high consumption of sweet beverages and alcohol. Therefore, it is necessary to improve nutritional intakes and encourage proper water intake habits, including coffee intake, for improved nutritional status of subjects."

Olick', 'Memorial Space', 'Spatial presentation', 'element']",,"(Background and Purpose) The urge to memorialize major events is not new. The difference is that the homages today are paid not with a painting on a cave wall or a statue in a park but often with something experiential and interactive. They do not merely evoke memories from those with direct experience of the actual past events, but they also can instill emotional reactions and empathy that feel somewhat like memories, created and sustained by those experiencing the reconstructed space of collective memories of events. Memorial spaces are those in which memory can be fully manifested and are a medium of collective memory that can link past events to the present and future. This study seeks to identify the most effective means of communicating collective memory of significant events. (Method) To begin, the researcher first studied the characteristics of collective memory theory of Maurice Halbwachs and Jeffrey K. Olick. Then, case studies were created in which a total of six memorial spaces in the national and international contemporary memorial spaces in various countries were classified by memory characteristics, how they are related to the presentation factors, and how they are expressed. (Results) Halbwachs`s theory of collective memory posits a correlation between the present, continuity, reconfiguration, selectivity, and place character. Olrick`s theory posits a correlation between persistence, selectivity, reconstruction, imagination, and temporality. The characteristics of collective memories can be divided into the memorial space area, spectator area, and spatial area. On the aspect of the memorial object, it can be classified by the characteristics of selectivity, temporality, interactivity, and reconfiguration in terms of viewers, currentness, persistence, imagination, and placeness. And the analysis model was completed through analyzed characteristics and spatial rendering factors. Finally, through the analysis model, the study analyzed the characteristics of collective memory according to the memorial space and the relationship between the form factor, proportional, circulation, light, and material, which are the spatial rendering elements, and proved to be effective. (Conclusions) This study helps identify the kind of presentation elements that can be used to express collective memory characteristics by examining the relationship between the characteristics of group memory and the presentation elements of memorial space. These can serve as guidelines for space design for those directing modern memorial spaces to function as a space for adding new memories and new meanings."

자산재평가가 감사보고시차 및 재량적 보고시차에 미치는 영향,2017,"['Asset Revaluation', 'Audit Report Lag', 'Management Discretionary Report Lag', '자산재평가', '감사보고시차', '재량적 보고시차']",,"Fair value evaluation is adopted over K-IFRS adoption. Especially, fair value evaluation model can be used on property, plant and equipment. Companies tried to improve financial condition like lowering debt ratio using asset revaluation when asset revaluation was allowed by Asset Revaluation Law during 1958～2000. However, Asset Revaluation Law was abolished after 2000. Asset revaluation was permitted again when K-IFRS was adopted.This study is an empirical study that analyzes the meaning of asset revaluation to auditor and information users. Many previous studies about asset revaluation suggest that asset revaluation is used as a way to improve financial condition(Song et al., 2011; Chung and Kim, 2015). However, Kim and Woo(2016) insist that asset revaluation relieves information asymmetry. If an executive uses asset revaluation as a way to improve financial condition, auditor would regard asset revaluation as a factor which increases audit risk. Because improvement of financial condition by asset revaluation doesn’t come from business improvement but from revaluation surplus, it is likely for auditor to regard asset revaluation as an executive’s discretionary action and to estimate audit risk high. Thus, audit report lag is likely to become longer. However, if auditor considers that asset revaluation can relieve information asymmetry, auditor would not consider asset revaluation as a factor which increases audit risk and try to provide accounting information to users earlier. Therefore, audit report lag might decrease. According to previous studies, investors consider asset revaluation positively(Kim et al., 2011; Yoo et al., 2012; Yang and Shin, 2013). Because executive prefers disclosing financial statements which include asset revaluation earlier, management discretionary report lag might decrease.The empirical results are as follows. First, we find that asset revaluation decreases audit report lag. This result suggests that auditor considers that asset revaluation relieve information asymmetry and have an incentive to decrease audit report lag. Second, there is no significant association between asset revaluation and management discretionary report lag. This result means that because auditor reduces audit report lag sufficiently even though asset revaluation relieve information asymmetry, there is no incentive for executive to reduce management discretionary report lag additionally.The contribution of this study is to provide an empirical evidence about whether auditor regards asset revaluation as a factor of which increases audit risk by examining auditor’s response on asset revaluation. This study also provides additional evidence about the meaning of asset revaluation by analyzing empirically on how executive behaves after external audit procedure in case of asset revaluation."

Despite the necessity, forecasting PTTDP is still one of challenges which should be successfully conquered in the forecasting area of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). To address this problem effectively, a methodology to dynamically predict PTTDP between motorwayinterchanges is proposed in this paper. The method was developed based on the relationships between traffic demands at motorway tollgates and PTTDPs between TGs in the motorway network. Two different data were used as the input of the model: traffic demand data and path travel time data are collected by toll collection system (TCS) and dedicated short range communication (DSRC), respectively. The proposed model was developed based on k-nearest neighbor, one of data mining techniques, in order for the real applications of motorway information systems. In a feasible test with real-world data, the proposed method performed effectively by means of prediction reliability and computational running time to the level of real application of current ATIS."

In this study, we present a method that can be used to calculate accurately the phonon MFP spectra of nanostructures based on simple phonon kinetic theory. Here, the kinetic theory may be employed by extracting only the diffusive-transport part of the phonon spectrum (i.e., the MFPs are less than a thermal length). By considering phonon dispersion and polarization effects, the phonon MFP distributions of silicon at room temperature are calculated from phonon transport properties and the spectral MFP. Our results are validated by comparison with those of the first principle and MFP spectroscopy data."

Jin’gangding jing, Jp. Kongōchōgyō 金剛頂経) were transmitted to an unnamed sage in south India (Nanten 南天, an abbreviation of Nan-Tenjiku 南天竺) from inside a mysterious iron stūpa (tettō 鉄塔). A few decades later, Kūkai 空海 (774–835), the founder of the Shingon school 真言宗 in Japan, identified that sage as Nāgārjuna, who came to be considered the third patriarch of Shingon Buddhism. Since then, that of the South Indian Iron Stupa (nanten tettō 南天鉄塔) has been an important theme in Japanese religious history; in particular, it became a symbol of the transmission of esoteric knowledge in intiation/consecration rituals (kanjō 灌頂) and was later transferred and adapted to newly created Buddhist rituals for Japanese deities (kami 神) known as jingi kanjō 神祇灌頂 or shintō kanjō 神道灌頂. This article explores some of the aspects of the myth and its doctrinal implications, especially regarding the epistemology and soteriology of Esoteric Buddhism. After a brief discussion of the Iron Stupa myth from East Asian canonical sources and Kūkai’s ideas about the tranmission of Esoteric teachings, I move on to examples of esoteric exegeses of this myth, both from the Shingon and Tendai denominations—as typical in such interpretive endeavors, the words of the myth, their meanings and their (supposed) external referents (objects and states of the world) are disassembled and recombined according to the principles of medieval Buddhist semiotics. Next, I trace further developments of the Iron Stupa myth as a central image in medieval rituals about Japanese kami. In the final considerations section I offer some elements to place this myth within the larger context of the system of meaning of Esoteric Buddhism."

The reinterpretation of kābash and rādāh is possible by scrutinizing the social context of creation narratives according to documentary hypothesis, investigating the meaning of God’s image which is given to man as the subject of kābash and rādāh, and discussing the significance of evaluative idiom(“very good”) in Genesis 1:31. From these argumentations, we tried to convert from master or conqueror over nature to stewardship as gardener.

The aim of this academic endeavor was to analyze the affiliation between nutritional status and cognitive functions of the elderly in Korea. 316 subjects, of 114 male and 201 female aged above 65 years, were gathered from university hospital clinics, Elderly Welfare Centers, and Health Welfare Centers located in the district of Seoul, Gyeonggi province, and Incheon in Korea. The cognitive function was tested by the Korean-Mini Mental State Examination (K-MMSE) questionnaire. Nutrition intake was assessed by a 24-hour recall, a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Nutrition adequacy and quality were assessed by the Nutrition Screening Initiative (NSI) checklist, the nutritional adequacy ratio (NAR), and the mean adequacy ratio (MAR). The elderly with normal cognitive function status displayed significantly higher levels of calcium, riboflavin, thiamin, folate, vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin B6, phosphorous, potassium, iron, niacin, zinc, animal fat, animal protein, polyunsaturated fatty acids, total protein, vegetable oil, vegetable protein, fiber than levels of the elderly with moderate cognitive impairment. The K-MMSE score positively correlated with of high consumption of pork, white radish, sea mustard, tomato, tangerine, grape, apple, and ice cream, and K-MMSE was negatively associated with high intake of potato, anchovy, fish cake, and mushroom. The findings suggest that nutritional status is affiliated with cognitive function within the elderly of Korea. The consumption of variety of foods and nutrients ensures adequate cognitive function in the Korean elderly."
「국가회계기준」의 수익인식기준과 「한국채택국제회계기준 제1115호 고객과의 계약에서 생기는 수익」의 비교:변동대가를 중심으로,2017,"['국가회계기준', '한국채택국제회계기준', '수익인식기준', '변동대가', 'Korean National Accounting Standards', 'K－IFRS', 'revenue recognition', 'variable consideration']","[연구목적]본 연구는 최근 개정된 기업회계기준서 제1115호 ‘고객과의 계약에서 생기는 수익’의 개정사항을 살펴보고, 현행 「국가회계기준에 관한 규칙」과 기획재정부예규에 규정된 수익인식 관련 조항 중 변동대가와 관련된 문제점을 파악한다. 다음으로, 그러한 미비점으로 인해 발생하는 실무 적용 상 문제점은 무엇인지 실제 사례(중앙행정부처의 정액기술료 관련 회계처리)를 제시하고, 그에 대한 해결방안으로 기업회계기준서 제1115호의 적용 가능성에 대해 검토한다.[연구방법]국가회계기준의 수익인식기준은 기업회계기준서 제1018호 ‘수익’의 관련 내용을 상당부분 차용하여 제정되었다. 다수의 해외 선진국들 또한 국제회계기준을 자국의 국가회계기준으로 직접 사용하거나 국가회계기준 제·개정 시 참고하고 있다. 이는 국제회계기준이 영리기업뿐만 아니라 정부부문에도 충분한 시사점을 제공할 수 있음을 의미하며, 본 연구의 접근방법의 타당성을 방증하는 것이다.[연구결과]기업회계기준서 제1115호는 변동대가에 대한 회계처리를 구체화했다는 점에서 정부부처의 기술료 수익인식 시점 및 금액 결정에 의미 있는 시사점을 제공한다. 계약 체결 이후에도 기술료의 감경, 면제, 유예 등이 빈번하게 발생하는 정액기술료의 속성으로 인해, 수익인식금액의 합리적 측정이 가능한 시점이 언제인지에 대해서 주체별로 이견이 존재한다. 국가결산보고서에 대한 결산검사 의무가 있는 감사원은 중앙행정부처가 과거 기술료 수령 경험을 활용하여 수익으로 인식할 금액을 합리적으로 추정할 수 있으므로 기술료 실시계약 체결 시점에서 수익을 인식해야 한다는 입장이고, 중앙행정부처는 정액기술료 수령금액의 불확실성이 매우 높기 때문에 그러한 추정이 합리적이라고 판단할 수 없고, 실제로 금액이 확정되는 기술료 수령시점이 적정한 수익인식 시점이라고 주장하고 있다.[연구의 시사점]기술료 제도의 수익인식처리와 관련하여 사업을 주관하는 해당 부처와 감사원 간에 이견이 발생하는 이유는 현행 국가회계기준에 관한 규칙과 관련 기획재정부예규, 기존의 기업회계기준서 제1018호가 해당 거래에 대한 회계처리를 명확하게 규정하지 않은 데 기인한다. 국가회계기준은 아직 도입 초창기이기 때문에 많은 부분에서 정비가 필요하다. 2018년 1월 1일부터 새로 적용되는 기업회계기준서 제1115호를 검토하여 개선방안을 모색하는 본 연구의 결과는 앞으로 있을 국가회계기준 제·개정 작업에 실질적인 도움이 될 것으로 기대된다.","[Purpose]This study seeks for a way to improve the Korean National Accounting Standards by comparing the Korean National Accounting Standards with International Financial Reporting Standards. Specifically, I review the IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and identify the deficiency of the present Korean National Accounting Standards regarding revenue recognition. Next, I present the potential problems due to the deficiency and, as a solution, explore the adaptability of IFRS 15, suggesting a real case.[Methodology]The revenue recognition of the Korean National Accounting Standards was introduced, borrowing the concept of IAS 8 Revenue. Several advanced countries adopted IFRS as their own national accounting standards or refer to IFRS when amending their own national accounting standards. This means that IFRS can provide the implication to a government sector as well as a private sector.[Findings]IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers makes additional contribution because it makes clear accounting for variable consideration. There has been argument with regard to the timing of revenue recognition of fixed－amount royalty between the practitioners and the Board of Auditing and Inspection of Korea, which is responsible for the audit of governmental bodies.[Implications]The reason for the disagreement is resulted from the silence in the Korean National Accounting Standards. The Standards need to be revised because this regulation is just in the beginning phase. The result of this study is expected to be useful for impending the revision of the Standards."

This is due to the dual nature of artificial intelligence: realized technological achievement and future possibilities. Therefore, artificial intelligence is uncertain despite many conceptualization attempts. At this point, the fundamental motivation for artificial intelligence to relate to humans as another subject and tool is human desire. Therefore, the problem of artificial intelligence should precede consideration of various desires projected into it. Artificial intelligence, on the other hand, is a scientific and technological product, and human desire is ideological and metaphysical. In other words, a more integrated and concrete research method is required for consideration of the desire aspect projected in artificial intelligence. This is possible through narrative. Especially, it is suitable to explore human desire in that the plot of the narrative takes the working principle of desire as a driving force. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the way in which the meaning of human desire and artificial intelligence projected into artificial intelligence is transformed from the tool to other subject through the analysis of Philip K. Dick's novel 『Does Android Dream of Electric Sheep?』 Through this research, we have been able to reflect on the origins of human being and to present practical methods for restoration, harmony and integration of humanity in the coming era of artificial intelligence."

Methods : This study used a phenomenological approach of qualitative study. The participants were 10 students in 3rd year of the occupational therapy program in K Univeristy. Data information was collected by one-to-one interview and analyzed through phenomenological research method. Results : Through the interview, 20 units of meaning, 8 central meanings, and 3 themes were drew. The information collected were analyzed into three themes; Learning Experiences in Online and Offline Courses, Request and Introspection of Learners on Flipped Learning. The result showed that online courses brought learners convenience and satisfaction with repeatable learning in every time and space the learner want. However, the learners appealed issues of communication and concentration due to the absence of face-to-face instruction by their instructor. For the offline courses, students showed interest in various practical classwork of sensory integration and changes in their attitude to actively engage in the practical classes. Conclusion : Flipped learning based instruction was effective for the sensory integration classes which require practice in terms of time securement and immersion in practice. The learners requested for adopting flipped learning based instruction to other subjects in occupational therapy curriculum, and introspected that they needed to actively engage in classes through the experience of flipped learning-based classes of sensory integration. The results of this study can be used as a basic resource when flipped learning classes are planned in occupational therapy education."
Decoupling peroxyacetyl nitrate from ozone in Chinese outflows observed at Gosan Climate Observatory,2017,,,"<P>Abstract. We measured peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and other reactive species such as O3, NO2, CO, and SO2 with aerosols including mass, organic carbon (OC), and elemental carbon (EC) in PM2. 5 and K+ in PM1. 0 at Gosan Climate Observatory in Korea (33.17° N, 126.10° E) during 19 October-6 November 2010. PAN was determined through fast gas chromatography with luminol chemiluminescence detection at 425 nm every 2 min. The PAN mixing ratios ranged from 0.1 (detection limit) to 2.4 ppbv with a mean of 0.6 ppbv. For all measurements, PAN was unusually better correlated with PM2. 5 (Pearson correlation coefficient, γ = 0.79) than with O3 (γ = 0.67). In particular, the O3 level was highly elevated with SO2 at midnight, along with a typical midday peak when air was transported rapidly from the Beijing areas. The PAN enhancement was most noticeable during the occurrence of haze under stagnant conditions. In Chinese outflows slowly transported over the Yellow Sea, PAN gradually increased up to 2.4 ppbv at night, in excellent correlation with a concentration increase in PM2. 5 OC and EC, PM2. 5 mass, and PM1. 0 K+. The high K+ concentration and OC ∕ EC ratio indicated that the air mass was impacted by biomass combustion. This study highlights PAN decoupling with O3 in Chinese outflows and suggests PAN as a useful indicator for diagnosing continental outflows and assessing their perturbation of regional air quality in northeast Asia. </P>"
Identification of radiopure titanium for the LZ dark matter experiment and future rare event searches,2017,,,"<P>The LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment will search for dark matter particle interactions with a detector containing a total of 10 tonnes of liquid xenon within a double -vessel cryostat. The large mass and proximity of the cryostat to the active detector volume demand the use of material with extremely low intrinsic radioactivity. We report on the radioassay campaign conducted to identify suitable metals, the determination of factors limiting radiopure production, and the selection of titanium for construction of the LZ cryostat and other detector components. This titanium has been measured with activities of U-238(e) < 1.6 mBq/kg, U-238(I) < 0.09 mBq/kg, Th-232(e) = 0.28 +/- 0.03 mBq/kg, Th-232(I) = 0.25 +/- 0.02 mBq/kg, K-40 <0.54 mBq/kg, and (60) Co <0.02 mBq/kg (68% CL). Such low intrinsic activities, which are some of the lowest ever reported for titanium, enable its use for future dark matter and other rare event searches. Monte Carlo simulations have been performed to assess the expected background contribution from the LZ cryostat with this radioactivity. In 1,000 days of WIMP search exposure of a 5.6-tonne fiducial mass, the cryostat will contribute only a mean background of 0.160 +/- 0.001(stat) +/- 0.030(sys) counts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Usefulness of the Korean Developmental Screening Test for infants and children for the evaluation of developmental delay in Korean infants and children: a single-center study,2017,"['Korean Developmental Screening Test', 'Screening test', 'Growth and development', 'Infant', 'Child']",,"Purpose: To evaluate the usefulness of the Korean Developmental Screening Test (K-DST) for infants and children for developmental delay assessment. Methods: This study was based on retrospective studies of the results of the K-DST, Preschool Receptive-Expressive Language Scale (PRES), Sequenced Language Scale for Infants (SELSI), Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), electroencephalography, magnetic resonance imaging, and extensive tests conducted in 209 of 1,403 patients, of whom 758 underwent the K-DST at the Korea University Guro Hospital between January 2015 and December 2016 and 645 were referred from local clinics between January 2015 and June 2016. Results: Based on the K-DST results, the male children significantly more frequently required further or follow-up examination than the female children in most test sections, except for gross motor. The male children had notably lower mean scores than the female children. The PRES/SELSI results showed that when more further or follow-up evaluations were required in the K-DST communication section, significantly more problems in language delay or disorder emerged. When further or follow-up evaluation was required in the cognitive section in the CARS/M-CHAT, the possibility of autism increased significantly. A child tended to score low in the CARS test and show autism when further or follow-up evaluation was recommended in the K-DST. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the usefulness of the K-DST as a screening test early in the development of infants and children in Korea. Data of normal control groups should be examined to determine the accuracy of this investigation."
Effect of internal angles between limbs of cross plan shaped tall building under wind load,2017,"['CFD', 'wind incidence angle', 'cross plan shaped building', 'k-e turbulence model', 'pressure co-efficient and force coefficient']",,"The present study revealed comparison the pressure distribution on the surfaces of regular cross plan shaped building with angular cross plan shaped building which is being transformed from basic cross plan shaped building through the variation of internal angles between limbs by 15 for various wind incidence angle from 0 to 180 at an interval of 30. In order to maintain the area same the limbs sizes are slightly increased accordingly. Numerical analysis has been carried out to generate similar nature of flow condition as per IS: 875 (Part –III):1987 (a mean wind velocity of 10 m/s) by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with help of ANSYS CFX (k-e model). The variation of mean pressure coefficients, pressure distribution over the surface, flow pattern and force coefficient are evaluated for each cases and represented graphically to understand extent of nonconformities due to such angular modifications in plan. Finally regular cross shaped building results are compared with wind tunnel results obtained from similar \'+\' shaped building study with similar flow condition. Reduction in along wind force coefficients for angular crossed shaped building, observed for various skew angles leads to develop lesser along wind force on building compared to regular crossed shaped building and square plan shaped building. Interference effect within the internal faces are observed in particular faces of building for both cases, considerably. Significant deviation is noticed in wind induced responses for angular cross building compared to regular cross shaped building for different direction wind flow."
Energetic and Frictional Effects in the Transport of Ions in a Cyclic Peptide Nanotube,2017,"['cyclic peptide nanotube', 'ion channel', 'molecular dynamics simulation', 'potential of mean force (PMF)', 'position-dependent diffusion coefficient']",,"The effects of geometric restraints and frictional parameters on the energetics and dynamics of ion transport through a synthetic ion channel are investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for several different ions. To do so, potential of mean force profiles and position-dependent diffusion coefficients for Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl− transport through a simple cyclic peptide nanotube, which is composed of 4× cyclo[−(D-Ala-Glu-D-Ala-Gln)2−] rings, are calculated via an adaptive biasing force MD simulation method and a Baysian inference/Monte Carlo algorithm. Among the restraints and parameters examined in this work, the radius parameter used in the flat-bottom half-harmonic restraint at the entrance and exit to channel has a great effect on the energetics of ion transport through the variation of entropy in the outside of the channel. The diffusivity profiles for the ions show a strong dependence on the damping coefficient, but the dependence on the coefficient becomes minimal inside the channel, indicating that the most important factor which affects the diffusivity of ions inside the channel is local interactions of ions with the structured channel water molecules through confinement."

The Westerners (西人), which seized the power with the Injo Restoration in 1623, regarded the growing power of local Sajok as a serious threat to the state authority or administrative system. They put brakes on the Sajok’s move by defining the relationship between the magistrates and local people as a quasi-parent-children one and banishing those who refuse to obey the administrative orders to remote places under the Pumin goso kŭmjibŏp (the Law to Prohibit People from Lodging Complaints against Magistrates).  Under the law, local magistrates strengthened their power, while the Sajok lost much of their influence over the local community in the absence of the means to check the administrative power of magistrates. With people obeying and treating the government officials as ‘pumogwan’ (parent-officials), the practice of kwanjonminbi (putting government before people) dominated the local community, and it also led to the practice of personal rule prevailing over the rule of law. Given the historical background, the ill practices due to kwanjonminbi and the governing by personal prerogative (先人後法) might be the historical legacy of Choson Dynasty which has deeply embedded into the social structure of Korea."

To reach that goal, as the attitude of practice, cattāro satipaṭṭhānā vippasanā suggest ‘sampajaño- satimā(constant thorough understanding and awareness)’ and ‘anissita (look away)’, and aṣṭaṅga-yoga Yoga do abhyāsa (effort to maintain) and vairāgya (look away). And, ‘satipaṭṭhāna(establishing of awareness)’ implies that ‘the meditator must actively try to maintain continuous consciousness of mind and body at the level of feeling (vedanā)’. When ‘abhyāsa’ can be understood, as the meaning of the phrase, that is carried out for a long time, with uninterrupted effort and positively accepting attitude to make the mind stable, ‘satipaṭṭhāna’ and ‘abhyāsa’ are related.Structurally, on the other hands, the aṣṭaṅga yoga can be understood in relation with cattāro satipaṭṭhānā vippasanā. The meditator, while practicing yama and niyama all the time, sitting in ‘a stable and comfortable place (āsana)’, observes the phenomenon of body and breathing (āsana and prāṇāyāma, kāyānupassanā), the feeling in the feeling (pratyāhāra, vedanānupassanā), and the phenomenon of the mind from the mind (dhāraṇā, dhyāna, samādhi, i.g. saṃyama, cittānupassanā). As a result, he got the wisdom about ‘the one who known prakṛti is changing so, that is not a “me” and the one who sees all things, he is a true self, a puruṣa’(viveka-khyāti, dhammānupassanā). Simply put, aṣṭaṅga yoga is a systematic description of a process that takes about one to three hours, shorter or longer, straightening the spine, sitting in a stable and comfortable position, focusing on the phenomena taking place in the body and mind."

These engineering contractors held lectures, banquets, and meetings through the association and formed close relationships with the Japanese Government-General of Korea, provincial government offices, and businesses, and they pursued profit by entering construction contracts with such officials and businessmen. Furthermore, by lobbying individuals in the Japanese cabinet (內閣) and political circles (政界) who are related to areas in the government that manage the budget of civil engineering and construction projects, they expanded their networks. Simultaneously, the engineering contractors attempted to reform the institutions and systems that were disadvantageous through the association, and they actively petitioned in order to ensure that more civil engineering and construction budget were allocated. Furthermore, the association actively strove to secure the vested interests of the members when the number of engineering contractors increased after the late 1920s.As such, the association for Chosŏn Civil Engineering and Construction performed the role of “oligopoly alliance,” through which the influential engineering contractors shared profits based on their exclusive sense of fellowship.

Satellite Bulk Tropospheric Temperatures as a Metric for Climate Sensitivity,2017,"['Climate sensitivity', 'satellite temperatures', 'volcano', 'El Niño']",,"We identify and remove the main natural perturbations (e.g. volcanic activity, ENSOs) from the global mean lower tropospheric temperatures (TLT) over January 1979 - June 2017 to estimate the underlying, potentially human-forced trend. The unaltered value is +0.155 K dec−1 while the adjusted trend is +0.096 K dec−1, related primarily to the removal of volcanic cooling in the early part of the record. This is essentially the same value we determined in 1994 (+0.09 K dec−1, Christy and McNider, 1994) using only 15 years of data. If the warming rate of +0.096 K dec−1 represents the net TLT response to increasing greenhouse radiative forcings, this implies that the TLT tropospheric transient climate response (ΔTLT at the time CO2 doubles) is +1.10 ± 0.26 K which is about half of the average of the IPCC AR5 climate models of 2.31 ± 0.20 K. Assuming that the net remaining unknown internal and external natural forcing over this period is near zero, the mismatch since 1979 between observations and CMIP-5 model values suggests that excessive sensitivity to enhanced radiative forcing in the models can be appreciable. The tropical region is mainly responsible for this discrepancy suggesting processes that are the likely sources of the extra sensitivity are (a) the parameterized hydrology of the deep atmosphere, (b) the parameterized heat-partitioning at the oceanatmosphere interface and/or (c) unknown natural variations."

Our starting point is the analyses of M.A.K. Halliday(1985) and E.I. Shendels(1972). Traditionally, a metaphor has been viewed as a variation in the use of words, i.e. a variation in meaning. Expanding the traditional definition of a metaphor, Halliday defines grammatical metaphors as ""variation in the expression of meanings"". Furthermore, he distinguished between two types of grammatical metaphors: ideational metaphors, which have to do with alternative ways of construing reality, and interpersonal metaphors, which offer alternative possibilities of expressing modal meanings (metaphors of modality), or exchanging commands (metaphors of mood).In Russian linguistics, the term ""grammatical metaphor"" was first introduced by E.I. Shendels. According to Shendels, a lexical metaphor is based on the transfer of the name of one object to another due to some common ground. The same mechanism works in the formation of the grammatical metaphor. Thus the grammatical metaphor is a transposition of a grammatical form from one type of grammatical relations to another. As in the case of the lexical metaphor, the grammatical metaphor violates conventionality and creates new connotations. Such concept of the grammatical metaphor is closer to the traditional concept of metaphors.Hence, on the basis of previous studies, we define grammatical metaphors as a transposition of forms of the grammatical categories, i.e. the use of grammatical forms in an unusual function to create a figurative meaning. In this article, we briefly examined the conversion of such grammatical categories as person, number, gender, mood, as well as personal/impersonal and transitive/intransitive verbs."

Despite the wide use of the MAI method in the geosciences, X-band SAR has rarely been applied in MAI-based studies due to the relatively shorter decorrelation periods involved. Thus, we need to evaluate the MAI measurements from X-band SAR for the use in the geosciences. In this paper, an assessment of the MAI performance for TerraSAR-X system was carried out at the test site, Kīlauea Volcano, Hawaii, focusing on the Kamoamoa fissure eruption episode that occurred on March 6–10, 2011. The root-mean-square (RMS) errors of single MAI interferograms were 3.26±1.32cm and 2.95±0.77cm for descending and ascending datasets, respectively. Multi-stacked MAI interferograms showed reduced error levels of 1.77 and 2.04cm for descending and ascending datasets, respectively. In addition, empirical uncertainty models of the MAI measurements were generated with respect to the interferometric coherence of single- and multi-stacked MAI measurements, and these regression models enabled us to confirm the difference between the theoretical and practical accuracies of the MAI measurements.

One scorpionate ligand possesses 4.5 potassium ions at six different positions in the solid state by means of the bridging oxygen atoms of the DMF solvent. Further coordination modes between the potassium ions and water/DMF provide a one-dimensional (1-D) metallascorpionate array and allow the formation of a 3-D hexagonal coordination network."
감사인 강제지정제 도입이 부실기업의 이익조정에 미치는 영향,2017,"['Auditor designation', 'earnings management', 'discretionary accruals', 'operating income', 'external audit', '감사인 강제지정', '이익조정', '재량적 발생액', '영업손익표시', '외부감사']",,"This paper investigates whether high-leverage firms engage in upward earnings management as a means to avoid auditor designation. Effective of November 2014, firms with (1) over 200% debt-equity ratio, (2) over 150% of industry average debt-toequity, and (3) less than 1 interest coverage ratio are forced to be audited by external auditors designated by the regulatory agency. This action may increase audit quality and credibility of accounting reports. However, there may be some unintended consequences, such as upward manipulation of operating income so that the interest coverage ratio could exceed 1. Based on FY 2014 consolidated financial statements prepared under K-IFRS, I select 42 firms in the interval to the immediate right of interest coverage ratio of 1 among manufacturing firms with over 200% debt-to-equity and over 150% of industry-average debt-to-equity as earnings management suspect firms. I find that suspect firms have significantly higher (performance-matched) discretionary accruals than matched sample. This implies that suspect firms could have avoided auditor designation through upward earnings manipulation using discretionary accruals. Also, evidence suggests that suspect firms may have manipulated operating income upward by classifying operating expenses into other expenses. These findings suggest that high-leverage firms tend to manipulate operating income upward in order to avoid external auditor designation, using the loophole in the current accounting regulation. The results in this paper have implications for regulatory agencies and auditors to be cautious in implementing and executing the revised policy."
Developing new automated alternation flicker using optic disc photography for the detection of glaucoma progression,2017,,,"<P>Purpose To evaluate a progression-detecting algorithm for a new automated matched alternation flicker (AMAF) in glaucoma patients. Methods Open-angle glaucoma patients with a baseline mean deviation of visual field (VF) test > -6 dB were included in this longitudinal and retrospective study. Functional progression was detected by two VF progression criteria and structural progression by both AMAF and conventional comparison methods using optic disc and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) photography. Progression-detecting performances of AMAF and the conventional method were evaluated by an agreement between functional and structural progression criteria. RNFL thickness changes measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT) were compared between progressing and stable eyes determined by each method. Results Among 103 eyes, 47 (45.6%), 21 (20.4%), and 32 (31.1%) eyes were evaluated as glaucoma progression using AMAF, the conventional method, and guided progression analysis (GPA) of the VF test, respectively. The AMAF showed better agreement than the conventional method, using GPA of the VF test (k=0.337; P<0.001 and k=0.124; P=0.191, respectively). The rates of RNFL thickness decay using OCT were significantly different between the progressing and stable eyes when progression was determined by AMAF(-3.49 +/- 2.86 mu m per year vs -1.83 +/- 3.22 mu m per year; P=0.007) but not by the conventional method (-3.24 +/- 2.42 mu m per year vs -2.42 +/- 3.33 mu m per year; P=0.290). Conclusions The AMAF was better than the conventional comparison method in discriminating structural changes during glaucoma progression, and showed a moderate agreement with functional progression criteria.</P>"

With this standard, however, the criminal courts in Korea have widened the meaning of ‘indecent act’ by including victim’s positions as well.This article, through a comparative research on the recent legal discussion and newly adopted sexual assault codes in the United States and the U.K,, contours the newly tried approach in interpreting‘sexual touching’ in the two countries where the perpetrator’s touch is‘sexual’when a reasonable person perceives the act as being sexual from a perpetrator’s objective position. Based on the research, this article, in a way to establish a clear standard on interpreting the meaning of ‘indecent’, suggests that the criminal court should evaluate all the related defendants’objective position, but not victim’s subjective one."

First of all, the Pierson-Moskowitz ocean spectrum was used to generate the rough sea surfaces. Then the relationship between the significant wave heights, root-mean-square(RMS) heights and wind speed was derived by estimating the significant wave heights and RMS heights of the generated sea surfaces according to various wind speeds, and compared the derived relationship with other measurement data sets. The reflection coefficients of the sea surfaces were calculated by using a numerical method(the moment method). Then, the numerical results were compared with Ament model, PO(Physical Optics) model, GO(Geometrical Optics) model and B-M(Brown-Miller) model for various roughness conditions(wind speed) and incidence angles. It was found that the Ament model is not accurate except for a very low roughness conditions(khrms<0.4, k is wavenumber and hrms is RMS height). It was also found that at incidence angles lower than 70°, the PO and the GO models agree well with the numerical results, while the B-M model agrees well with the numerical analysis results at incidence angles higher than 80° for very rough sea surfaces with khrms>10."
Measurement of Knee Rotation Angles Using a Smartphone Application: An Experimental Study of Porcine Knees,2017,"['Knee', 'Rotation', 'Smartphone', 'Mobile application']",,"Purpose: This study evaluated the efficacy of a smartphone application in the measurement of rotation angles in porcine knees.Materials and Methods: Two K-wires were fixated to the femoral condyle and anterior tibial crest of 10 porcine legs. The angle created between the K-wires with an external rotation force applied was measured on a photograph and defined as the true angle. The same force was applied to the legs placed on a splint with a smartphone attached to the plantar side. The angle presented on a smartphone application was determined as the measured angle. The differences between the true and measured angles in 30° and 90° knee flexion and differences in measured angles depending on the status of the popliteus tendon were compared.Results: In the intact knees, the mean true angles in 30° and 90° flexion were 20.5°±1.4° and 19.1°±1.3°, respectively, and the mean measured angles in 30° and 90° flexion were 21.1°±0.9° and 18.6°±1.6°, respectively. When the popliteus tendon was cut, the mean true angles in 30° and 90° flexion were 31.4°±1.1° and 38.5°±2.5°, respectively, and the mean measured angles in 30° and 90° flexion were 31.8°±1.2° and 39.2°±2.8°, respectively. The differences between the true and measured angles were not significant. The measured angle increased by more than 10° after cutting of the popliteus tendon in both 30° and 90° flexion.Conclusions: Using a smartphone application could be a good method of measuring knee rotation."

Kayou (or Yamasaki) in Japan was located close to Katano and Minase, where the Emperor used to enjoy hunting, and it also served as a place where Emperor Saga stayed after the emperor enjoyed hunting. According to Nihon Kōki, Emperor Sage, together with his bureaucrats, visited Kayou for several purposes (including hunting) every February, and they enjoyed reciting Kayou-themed poems in the palace of Kayou. This has been called the “Kayou” poem, which is composed in form of “Kunshin Shouwa” (the style in which the emperor and his bureaucrats recite poems together). Such Kayou poems are found in Ryōunshū (8 poems) and in Bunkashūreishū (18 poems). In the former, most poems describe the nature of Kayou, conveying the amicable atmosphere of the emperor and his bureaucrats, while in the latter, most poems describe quiet space apart from the contaminated outer world.

In this study, 353 full-time, SRN (age 28.7±3.95 years 341 females, mean shift–working duration=5 years 9 months) at one university hospital completed the K-MCTQshift and the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ). Time in bed, sleep duration, and mid-sleep time (sleep onset time+1/2 sleep duration) were evaluated on work days and free days. Social jet lag was computed for each shift. Chronotype was assessed based on the mid-sleep time on free days corrected for sleep debt accumulated over the workweek (MSFSC). Results: Sleep duration on workdays were 5.2 hours (day shift, D), 7.7 hours (evening shift, E), and 5.7 hours (night shift, N), respectively. Alarm clock usage on workdays was the highest in day-shifts (92.4%). The chronotype of 166 SRN who did not use alarm on free days was 6:09 h. Social jet lag was the longest in day-shifts (3.3 hours), and the shortest in evening-shifts (0.3 hour). Mid-sleep after the evening-shift (MSWE, MSFE, MSFESC) showed significant correlations with MEQ scores. Conclusions: The Korean MCTQshift provides actual sleep-wake patterns per shift schedule and chronotype in shift workers. We suggest that the sleep-corrected version of mid-sleep on free days after evening shifts (MSFESC) is suitable for assessing chronotype in shift workers."

The mean score of dementia knowledge was low(15.86±4.58). The area with the highest correct answer rate for dementia knowledge was life impact(64.2%) and the disease progression area(39.6%) was the lowest. The attitude toward dementia (45.15±4.59) and service requirements(89.88±9.38) were relatively high. There were positive correlations between dementia knowledge and dementia attitude(r=.11, p=.008) and service requirements(r=.21, p<.001) and between dementia attitude and service requirements(r=.34, p<.001). Therefore, accurate knowledge of dementia was closely related to positive attitudes. In conclusion, this studyis expected to provide the basic data for the development, application and evaluation of dementia education programs for nursing students."

PFO was heat treated at 390~400 ℃ for 1~3h to prepared the pitch. Three carbon precursors (pitch) prepared by the thermal reaction were 3903 (at 390 ℃ for 3h), 4001 (at 400 ℃ for 1h) and 4002 (at 400 ℃ for 2h). Also, the effect of chemical activation catalysts and mixing time on the development of porosity during carbonization was investigated. The prepared carbon was analyzed by BET and FE-SEM. It was shown that chemical activation with KOH could be successfully used to develop carbon with specific surface area (3.12 ㎡/g) and mean pore size (22 nm). The electrochemical characteristics of modified carbon as the anode were investigated by constant current charge/discharge, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance tests. The coin cell using pitch (4002) modified by KOH has better initial capacity (318 mAh/g) than that of other pitch coin cells. Also, this prepared carbon anode appeared a high initial efficiency of 80% and the retention rate capability of 2C/0.1 C was 92%. It is found that modified carbon anode showed improved cycling and rate capacity performance."
Life Space Assessment in Stroke Patients,2017,"['Life space', 'Stroke', 'Mobility', 'Quality of life', 'Depression']",,"Objective To evaluate the reliability of the practical life space in post-stroke patients using the Korean version of the Life-Space Assessment (K-LSA) questionnaire and to assess the relationships between the K-LSA and physical function, daily activity, quality of life, and post-stroke depression.Methods The LSA questionnaire was translated into Korean, and the translated version was authorized by the author of the LSA questionnaire. In a cross-sectional study, the performance of the K-LSA was evaluated in 34 stroke patients (20 males and 14 females; mean age 65.11±2.39 years) who were receiving physical and occupational therapy at the outpatient clinic in the rehabilitation medicine department of a university medical center at the time of evaluation. Performances were assessed twice by one examiner at a 2-week interval to test the reliability. The patients were evaluated using the Functional Ambulation Category (FAC) scale, Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scale, and mobility subscale of the FIM to assess their relationships with the K-LSA. They were also evaluated using the EuroQol 5 Dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) to determine the relationship with quality of life and post-stroke depression.Results Test-retest reliability at the first (62.20±32.14) and second (63.15±32.22) assessment was 0.993 (p<0.01). The K-LSA showed significant correlations with the FAC (r=0.848, p<0.01), FIM (r=0.765, p<0.01), mobility category of the FIM (r=0.764, p<0.01), GDS (r=-0.657, p<0.01), and EQ-5D (r=0.506, p<0.01).Conclusion This study suggests that the practical life space of post-stroke patients, assessed by the K-LSA, has a significant correlation with patients' functional mobility, independence in daily activity, quality of life, and depression."
Comparison Between Korean Version of Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly and International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form in Evaluation of Frailty Phenotype,2017,"['Frail elderly', 'Cohort studies', 'Exercise', 'Motor activity', 'Physical activity']",,"Background: Evaluation of frailty in older people requires assessment of their physical activity level. The Korean version of the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (K-PASE) questionnaire is more comprehensive, yet it can be time-consuming and costly to administer on a large scale. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) short form, which is simpler and free of charge, may replace the K-PASE for defining the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) frailty phenotype. Methods: We analyzed data from 160 community-dwelling older adults (mean age: 75 years) who were administered both the K-PASE and IPAQ short form questionnaires as part of the assessments in the Aging Study of Pyeongchang Rural Area. We compared agreements between the 2 physical activity questionnaires and between the CHS frailty phenotype defined using the K-PASE and IPAQ short form. Correlations between each CHS frailty phenotype definition and common geriatric syndromes were assessed. Results: The physical activity level measured using the K-PASE correlated modestly with the level measured using the IPAQ short form (correlation coefficient, 0.250; p=0.001). However, the agreement was substantially higher between the CHS frailty phenotype based on the K-PASE and the definition based on the IPAQ short form (Cohen kappa, 0.625; p<0.001). Both frailty phenotype definitions were positively correlated with most geriatric conditions. Conclusion: The simpler IPAQ short form may replace the more comprehensive K-PASE for assessing CHS frailty phenotype in older people. Our results should inform frailty assessment in research and clinical care settings."

Bhabha', 'hybridity', 'racial prejudice', 'self-identity', 'Marshall`s Brown Girl', 'Brownstones', 'Silko`s Ceremony', 'Chang-rae', 'Lee`s On Such a Full Sea']",,"This study analyzes Marshall's Brown Girl, Brownstones, Silko's Ceremony and Lee's On Such a Full Sea using the framework of Homi K. Bhabha's ideas of the translational space of hybridity. It is true that some critics rightly criticize Bhabha's theory as having limitation in considering the present time in which national cultures are being weakened or incorporated into the culture logic of transnational capitals. Nevertheless, Bhabha's third space of hybridity can be very useful in correcting the mistaken logic of cultural imperialism, which states that the culture of the center will dominate that of the periphery. Bhabha's idea of the translational space of hybridity is to rethink the unconscious structure of postcolonial discourses and deconstruct the one-sided domination by colonizers within colonialist discourses.The young heroine, Selina in Brown Girl, Brownstones, confronts the cultural conflicts between Barbados and New York and loses her identity. As she matures, she tries to establish her own self-identity as a Caribbean-American and a black female living in America through understanding her parents' generation and fusing the two distinct cultures. The cure for Tayo’s broken self caused by cultural collisions between the White and Native American in Ceremony is to realize cultural hybridity and to learn to adapt and alter ancient traditions to fit modern situations. Silko asserts that the tribal cultures and values may be adapted and transformed by cultural exchanges and the hybridization of different cultures. In Lee's On Such a Full Sea, the future of human life doesn’t lie in the world of Charter District, which has absolute wealth and economic affluence, but in the translational space of hybridity which is opened, has boundless imagination itself, and produces new meaning like an impromptu and spontaneous mural painting. These three novels provide the readers with the opportunities to explore various manifestations of intercultural, interethnic and interclass dynamics.In conclusion, this paper tries to appropriate a positive sense of Bhabha's ideas of the translational space of hybridity, to investigate the protagonists’ reactions to racial prejudice, different cultures, and ruling class, and to examine those protagonists’ attempts to achieve harmony with other races, cultures and classes in that space. Marshall, Silko and Lee present the possibility of reconciliation and coexistence among different races, ethnic cultures, and socioeconomic classes in terms of cultural hybridity."

Materials and Methods: Fifty-four patients who received surgical treatment for distal radius fracture were enrolled in this study. They were divided into two groups according to treatment modality: Group 1 included 34 patients who underwent internal fixation with volar locking plate and Group 2 included 20 patients with percutaneous K-wire fixation. Thickness of the PQ muscle was measured using an ultrasonography at the final follow-up. We evaluated the outcomes using the Mayo wrist score, wrist range of motion, and grip strength at the final follow-up. Results: Compared with the uninjured side, thickness of the PQ muscle showed 31.9% of mean atrophy in Group 1 and 11.4% in Group 2. The atrophy of PQ muscle was severe in Group 1 (p=0.01). However, there was no significant difference in the mean Mayo wrist score between the two groups (83.1±10.9 in Group 1 and 80.2±8.9 in Group 2, p=0.28), except a mild limitation of pronation in Group 1. Conclusion: The healed PQ muscle from fracture itself after distal radius fracture revealed a morphological atrophy. Moreover, the volar locking plate resulted in greater atrophy of the PQ muscle, but there was no specific impact on clinical outcomes."

Methods: The Korean Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-third edition (K-WISC-III) and Korean Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-fourth edition (K-WISC-IV) were administered to 13 children and adolescents with TD, 17 children and adolescents with ADHD, and 15 children and adolescents with TD+ADHD. Each parameter was compared among the groups using the Kruskal-Wallis test.  Results: The mean scores of the freedom from distractibility/working memory index (FD/WMI) and the digit span and arithmetic subtests of the TD+ADHD group were significantly lower than those of the TD group.  Conclusion: According to the intelligence test results, the comorbid ADHD+TD group showed a significant decrease in working memory compared to the TD group. These findings are similar to those of previous research on cognitive functions and suggest that the TD+ADHD comorbid and TD alone groups exhibit different endophenotypes. The results also imply that WISC-III and WISC-IV, the most commonly used intelligence tests clinically, are effective in evaluating cognitive functions such as attention. Further research is required to confirm these results."

Measurement of Knee Rotation Angles Using a Smartphone Application: An Experimental Study of Porcine Knees,2017,"['Knee', 'Rotation', 'Smartphone', 'Mobile application']",,"Purpose: This study evaluated the efficacy of a smartphone application in the measurement of rotation angles in porcine knees.Materials and Methods: Two K-wires were fixated to the femoral condyle and anterior tibial crest of 10 porcine legs. The angle created between the K-wires with an external rotation force applied was measured on a photograph and defined as the true angle. The same force was applied to the legs placed on a splint with a smartphone attached to the plantar side. The angle presented on a smartphone application was determined as the measured angle. The differences between the true and measured angles in 30° and 90° knee flexion and differences in measured angles depending on the status of the popliteus tendon were compared.Results: In the intact knees, the mean true angles in 30° and 90° flexion were 20.5°±1.4° and 19.1°±1.3°, respectively, and the mean measured angles in 30° and 90° flexion were 21.1°±0.9° and 18.6°±1.6°, respectively. When the popliteus tendon was cut, the mean true angles in 30° and 90° flexion were 31.4°±1.1° and 38.5°±2.5°, respectively, and the mean measured angles in 30° and 90° flexion were 31.8°±1.2° and 39.2°±2.8°, respectively. The differences between the true and measured angles were not significant. The measured angle increased by more than 10° after cutting of the popliteus tendon in both 30° and 90° flexion.Conclusions: Using a smartphone application could be a good method of measuring knee rotation."
Effect of Temperature on Wear Behavior in a Ti-V-Cr Base Fireproof Titanium Alloy,2017,"['Titanium alloy', 'Fireproof', 'Dry sliding wear', 'High temperature', 'Wear mechanism']",,"Dry sliding wear tests on pin-on-disk samples were performed in a Ti-35V-15Cr-0.3Si-0.1C fireproof titanium alloy against itself at different temperatures from 298 K to 1173 K. The mean friction coefficient and volume wear rate gradually decreased with an increase of testing temperature, although the volume wear rate at 1173 K exhibited a reverse trend. The tribo-oxide layer did not exist on the worn surface at 298 K, while discontinuous thin tribo-oxide layer was observed at 823 K. The tribo-oxide layer became thick and continuous at 973 K and it contacted with the substrate compactly. When the temperature increased up to 1173 K, the tribo-oxide layer further became thick with formation of cracks inside the layer. The adhesive wear and abrasive wear were the predominant wear mechanism at 298 K. With increasing the testing temperature, the wear mechanism underwent a transition from the abrasive wear and oxidative wear at 823 K to the mild oxidative wear at 973 K, and further to the severe oxidative wear at 1173 K."

The yogic physiology of haṭhayoga reflected in Indian mythology, 〈The churning of the ocean of milk(Kṣīrodamathana)〉 myth of 『Viṣṇu Purāṇa』, is a review of the concept of haṭha, which means the sun energy(陽) and the moonenergy(陰), the cosmic dual forces. In this mythology, Viṣṇu has a dynamic sovereignty and a special character as a master of life-energy(prāṇa, Qi, 氣).  As the sattvic functions of three guṇas(sattva, rajas, tamas), Viṣṇu is the centerpiece of the interdynamic harmony of the left and right energies. In human body, when rajas(the dynamic energy of right side; 陽) and tamas(the static energy of left side; 陰) are balanced with, the sattvic energy appear to yogi. This is what Vishnu`s properties have been revealed as a principle of yogic physiology through mythology.  〈The churning of the ocean of milk〉 myth which based on Viṣṇu, is carrying out the course of yoga implementation. With the help of Viṣṇu, Devas gets the amṛta which is the elixir of life, the eternal immortality. The getting of miraculous medicine is the important course of yogic practice. We""re going to be able to use the rivalry function of right and left energy by yoga. Devas and Asuras are left and right energies in our inside.  The harmonization of Devas and Asuras is achieved through Viṣṇu and the amṛta are raised by rotating of Mandara mountain. The center of Mandara mountain is the center of the body, which is connected to the rotating cakras. By the rotation of cakra and the penetration of Suṣumnā nāḍī, The yogi achieves the yogic achievement of immortality.  In 〈The unity(marriage) of Śiva and Pārvatī〉 myth, sexual energy(Śakti) is the root of the Creation. At the same time, it is the subject of tapas(asceticism). This myth in which Brahman`s expansion of cosmos confronts with Śiva’s sexual asceticism shows the stage of yoga achieved by the perfect control over sexual desire. Śiva has been symbolized as the success to the ultimate achievement which Yogi should reach through the restraint of sexual energy(Śakti), namely, Brahmacarya(chastity). Yogi’s sexual desire must be fully controlled over.  Thus, These myths symbolize the most basic physiology of yoga. Indian myths are not a product of simple literary imagination but the most efficient way to accomplish the principle of practical yoga."

한국 실크로드 음악연구의 현황과 전망,2017,"['Silk Road music', 'Silk road', 'ancient music', 'musical interchange', 'music']",,"This paper analyze the status and prospect on the study of the Silk Road music in Korea.In this paper, ‘Silk Road music’ not only means music on the Silk Road, but also the process of transferring and changing music from one country to another and the musical interchange of countries.Because Silk Road music was used in various rituals and festivals, the ancient people were able to enjoy regardless of social status. Because it spread rapidly from mouth to mouth, it explains the interchange of Silk Road effectively than any other elements of civilization.This paper analyzed the study of the Silk Road music divided by the 3 period. The first period starts from 1991 to 2000, the second period starts from 2001 to 2007, and the third period starts from 2008 to now.In the first period, it appeared the theme of ‘Silk Road music’. In this period, the study of scholar Chun-In Pyong formed a state of study.In the second period, when the book 『The Silkroadology』 of scholar Jeong-su il is published, it began to make efforts to solidify the silk road in academia. In this period, various scholars participate in study on the Silk Road music, and they tried to connect specific musical instruments and local music with musical interaction on the Silk Road.In the third period, Gyeongsangbuk-province actively pushed ahead with events and projects about the Silk Road during the ‘Silk Road Expo 2015’ in Gyeong-ju. Various scholars analyzed the origin of Korean ancient musical instruments, and connect this with musical interaction on the silk road.However, the study on the Silk Road music is still small compared to other cultural and arts field. So, in order to develop study in this field, we need a new method that differs from existing efforts.First, we can find the musical elements about Silk Road from korean classical music or k-pop, which are familiar to the public. And we can connect with modern music with Silk Road music. Second, It is necessary to build a voice file database for books and promotional materials to listen Silk Road Music directly. Third, It is necessary to create new story or make a film based on the Silk Road. Fourth, it is good method to create a Silk Road recording that reproduce ancient Silk Road music. Fifth, we need to expand our interest in the Silk Road music through holding events such as conference and a fair supported by government."

It will provide means for new growth and development through innovative technologies, such as artificial intelligence, bio-technology, robot-engineering, Internet of Things, 3D printings, and fintech that will lead to historic social changes.Part II of this Article defines the fintech industry and briefly looks into adequate stance for regulation of fintech industry generally. Fintech is a fusion of technology used in providing financial services and informational communication technology. It could be a discrimination to exempt or mitigate fintech firms from rational ordinary regulation only for they apply fintech itself. Whereas it is sometimes essential for the success of the fintech firms to deregulate irrational banning hurdles, the fintech firms should innovate to break through traditional financial service industry into success.And in Part Ⅲ, I shift my focus into the specialized study of legal issues including the separation of banking and commerce on the point of view with the online bank such as the K-Bank that was recently approved by the Financial Services Commission. Online banks are exactly kind of banks so that the principle of separation of banking and commerce should be applied to them naturally. If the principle does not apply to online banks for certain circumstantial causes, then I concern whether the principle will collapse in the context of traditional banks in the ends.Part Ⅳ analyses the adequacy of regulation of crowdfunding in Korea, looking into its history and the present condition in the U.S. The Korea Financial Investment Services and Capital Markets Act (amended on July 24, 2015) introduced the equity crowdfunding as online small-sum investment brokerage. This is the first legislation of crowdfunding in Korean legal system. In the crowdfunding, the entrepreneur of small start-up can raise capital from many investors through the Internet platforms, particularly by using social networks. And there is a need to inform investors about the projects so as to assure the crowd decide rationally as a collective intelligence. So I feel that more freedom to advertise or investment recommendation for the online small-sum investment broker or the issuer should be allowed through deregulation.In Part Ⅴ, I found that the payments processing and peer-to-peer money transfer service by fintech firms on one hand need regulation for the Cyber safety, but on the other deregulation of small-sum peer-to-peer foreign money transfer services for more competition in this area. Lastly, Part Ⅵ concludes by offering positive policy suggestions that follow from my analysis."
Structure and Refinement Performance of Al-5Ti-0.2C Master Alloy Produced via an Improved Self Propagating Synthesis Approach,2017,"['alloys', 'self-propagating synthesis', 'microstructure', 'scanning electron microscopy (SEM)', 'grain refinement']",,"When Al-Ti-C master alloys are produced via the conventional Self-propagating High-temperature Synthesis(SHS), the reduction of production temperature below 1523 K leads to the drastic deterioration of the refiner efficacy.In the present work, a simple yet effective way to improve the combustion process for low TiC-containingrefiners is proposed. The SHS reaction was performed to obtain Al-10TiC slurry first, which subsequently wasmixed with Al-Ti melt to obtain Al-5Ti-0.2C master alloy. By means of the proposed method, the process temperaturewas lowered to 1323 K. According to the results, in the case of improved SHS approach, the Al temperatureafter the onset of reaction increases by 90-100 K more than in the case of conventional preparation route,providing better kinetic conditions for TiC formation. As a result, at 1323 K production temperature, the averagecarbide size increases by 100% as compared to the conventionally produced refiner, which is claimed to be a reasonfor the improved refining performance of master alloy."
Effects of lamotrigine on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in pediatric epilepsy patients,2017,"['Child', 'Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Seizures', 'Anticonvulsants']",,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of lamotrigine for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in children with epilepsy. Methods: Pediatric patients newly diagnosed with epilepsy (n=90 [61 boys and 29 girls]; mean age, $9.1{\pm}3.4years$) were enrolled. All patients were evaluated with the Korean ADHD rating scale (K-ARS)-IV before treatment with lamotrigine and after doses had been administered. The mean interval of ADHD testing was approximately 12.3 months. The initial dosage of lamotrigine was 1 mg/kg/day (maximum 25 mg/day for the first 2 weeks), and increased by 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks until titrated up to 7 mg/kg/day (or maximum 200 mg/day). Results: The mean ADHD test score of the 90 subjects was $17.0{\pm}1.8$ at baseline. It was slightly reduced to $15.6{\pm}1.7$ after lamotrigine monotherapy (P>0.01). Prior to treatment, a total of 31 patients (34.4%) met the diagnostic criteria for ADHD according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision, Of these 31 patients, 27 (87.1%) had significantly improved ADHD scores with lamotrigine monotherapy ($28.0{\pm}1.6$ reduced to $18.1{\pm}2.6$, P<0.001). Among these 27 patients, 25 (92.6%) showed normalized electroencephalogram (EEG) and 26 (96.3%) achieved total freedom from seizures within 12 months of the initiation of lamotrigine monotherapy. Conclusion: The results from our study show that lamotrigine had a positive effect in pediatric epilepsy patients by reducing ADHD symptoms, preventing seizures, and normalizing EEG. However, further research is required to determine whether lamotrigine is efficacious against ADHD symptoms independent of its effects on epileptic seizures."

From these circumstances, in order for the crowdfunding market not to be regarded as a casino, it shall earn the trusts of the investors, and the decision of the investors shall be able to be justified systematically.Paternal protection of the investors cannot be a solution. The invested money within the limit is still in danger. After the period of resale prohibition, the very high risk burdened to the first investors is simply transferred to the second investors. Even the secondary markets such as KSM and K-OTC BB do not provide any countermeasures to information asymmetry problem. The current crowdfunding system shall be reconsidered with reform.Originally, crowdfunding was legislated for the purpose of economic stimulation and startup supports. To answer the purpose, any regulation which hinders the revitalization of crowdfunding market and does not have enough effects to protect investors shall be abolished. The current crowdfunding system heavily regulates the funding platform. However, the funding platform is the only player in the crowdfunding market to select promising startups, which can reward the investors successfully. Funding platform shall be able to perform its role actively under the light touch regulation on its entrance and activity.As the participation of unsophisticated investors will increase, they shall make the investment decision after fully informed with the very high risk of crowdfunding. These reform will justify the revitalization of crowdfunding market."

Thermoelectric power factors calculated by DFT simulation were gradually enhanced as increase in annealing temperature. Maximum power factor was obtained with high magnitude of $S^2{\sigma}=566{\mu}W/m{\cdot}K^2$ at 1100 K through a dominant improvement of Seebeck coefficient compared with electrical conductivity. Experimentally, the LCMO nanomaterials were hydrothermally synthesized and then treated by post thermal annealing with temperature variation. X-ray diffraction and SEM analysis illustrated that LCMO exhibited orthorhombic perovskite structures with small grain size of 16~19 nm over 873 K. The results directly confirmed that improvement of crystallinity and decrease of mean grain size given by post thermal annealing lead to enhancements of electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient, respectively."

Pearson correlation coefficients were computed for the total oral functional score, PCC and DDK of each group. The statistical analysis showed that there is no significant difference in total functional score and DDK when IQ was controlled. There was a significant correlation between total oral functional score and PCC in the Down’s syndrome group and a significant correlation between total oral functional score and intelligibility in the Down’s syndrome group whether IQ was controlled or not. The findings suggest that both cognitive ability and overall oral motor function need to be considered for the intervention to enhance PCC or speech intelligibility of children with Down""s syndrome."
Mobile Application based on Image Processing and a Proportion for Food Intake Measuring,2017,"['Food intake', 'Image-based volumetric algorithm', 'Image segmentation', 'Mobile application', '3D estimation']",,"In the paper, we propose a new reliable technique for measuring food intake based on image automatically without user intervention. First, food and bowl image before and after meal is obtained by user. The food and the bowl are divided into each region by the K-means clustering, Otsu algorithm, Morphology, etc. And the volume of food is measured by a proportional expression based on the information of the container such as it’s entrance diameter, depth, and bottom diameter. Finally, our method calculates the volume of the consumed food by the difference between before and after meal. The proposed technique has higher accuracy than existing method for measuring food intake automatically. The experiment result shows that the average error rate is up to 7% for three types of containers. Computer simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm is a convenient and accurate method of measuring the food intake."

The severity of aphasia was evaluated by the aphasia quotient (AQ) and the language quotient (LQ).Results Anomic aphasia was the most frequent type of aphasia (n=15, 39.5%), and the lesion most frequently observed in subcortical aphasia was located in the basal ganglia (n=19, 50.0%). Patients with lesions in the basal ganglia exhibited the lowest scores on the FMI for the upper extremities (p=0.04). Severity of aphasia was significantly correlated with the K-MBI (Pearson correlation coefficient: g=0.45, p=0.01 for AQ and g=0.53, p=0.01 for LQ) and FMI scores for the lower extremities (g=0.43, p=0.03 for AQ and g=0.49, p=0.05 for LQ). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, K-MBI remained the only explanatory variable closely associated with aphasia severity.Conclusion This study showed the general characteristics of post-stroke subcortical aphasia, and it revealed that K-MBI was an associated and explanatory factor for aphasia severity."
Ballistic electronic and thermal conductance of monolayer and bilayer black phosphorus,2017,['Black phosphorus Ballistic conductance First principle'],,"We performed first principle calculations based on density functional theory and GW approximation with Landauer approach to study ballistic electronic conductance and ballistic thermal conductance of black phosphorus (BP) whose dimensions are smaller than the mean free path of carriers. Ballistic electronic conductance of monolayer BP and bilayer BP with four different stacking styles, and ballistic thermal conductance of monolayer BP were investigated. The electronic transmission value along armchair direction is found to be a little higher than that along zigzag direction near the band gap energy range. Our calculations showed that, the G point hole effective mass along zigzag direction is stackingstyle sensitive, while other G point effective mass is independent of stacking style. We also reported the anisotropic ballistic thermal conductance of monolayer BP: the anisotropic ballistic thermal conductance ratio of zigzag-to-armchair approaches a constant (about 2.0) when the temperature is beyond 200 K.The reasons for these properties were discussed."

CYP2D6 genotypes and metabolic ratios (MRs) ofdextromethorphan were determined in 201 Koreans. Unsupervised clustering algorithms, hierarchicaland k-means clustering analysis, and color visualizations of CYP2D6 activity were performedon a subset of 130 subjects. A total of 23 different genotypes were identified, five of which wereobserved in one subject. Phenotype classifications were based on the means, medians, and standarddeviations of the log MR values for each genotype. Color visualization was used to display the meanand median of each genotype as different color intensities. Cutoff values were determined usingreceiver operating characteristic curves from the k-means analysis, and the data were validated inthe remaining subset of 71 subjects. Using the two highest silhouette values, the selected numbers ofclusters were three (the best) and four. The findings from the two clustering algorithms were similarto those of other studies, classifying *5/*5 as a lowest activity group and genotypes containingduplicated alleles (i.e., CYP2D6*1/*2N) as a highest activity group. The validation of the k-meansclustering results with data from the 71 subjects revealed relatively high concordance rates: 92.8%and 73.9% in three and four clusters, respectively. Additionally, color visualization allowed for rapidinterpretation of results. Although the clustering approach to predict CYP2D6 phenotype fromCYP2D6 genotype is not fully complete, it provides general information about the genotype to phenotyperelationship, including rare genotypes with only one subject."

In this study, the relationships between personality characteristics, cognitive control and risk behaviors were examined in male and female college students. Fifty seven male and 60 female students of K University in D city voluntarily participated in the study. Personality characteristics were assessed by means of Arnett’s Sensation Seeking Scale and Barratt’s Impulsivity Scale. Cognitive control was measured through the Flanker interference and conflict adaptation effects, which were assessed via the Eriksen Flanker task. Risk behaviors were assessed by the frequencies of risk behaviors in the past year. Regardless of gender, sensation seeking but not impulsivity was related to risk behaviors. The Flanker interference and conflict adaptation effects were not related to risk behaviors in females. However, the conflict adaptation effect was related to risk behaviors in males. Males displayed high levels of risk behaviors when they showed poor cognitive control. When sensation seeking was controlled, the conflict adaptation effect predicted males’ risk behaviors. This study indicated that cognitive control is an important cognitive predictor of male college students’ risk behaviors and that the conflict adaptation effect predicted risk behaviors better than the Flanker interference effect."

The annual incidence rates of Korea national notifiable infectious diseases in 16 different regions from 2001 to 2016 were analyzed using K-means clustering. Four clusters from non-normalized and normalized analyses were obtained for the annual incidence rates of these diseases by region. This study demonstrates the possibility of developing objective and reproducible approaches to regional segmentation for national infection control."
The Effects of Subtitled Movies on Learners’ Affective Domain and Productive Vocabulary Knowledge,2017,"['movie subtitle', 'affective domain', 'productive vocabulary knowledge']",,"This article investigated the effects of subtitled movies on learners’ affective domain and productive vocabulary knowledge. 44 university students participated in the study. Before watching the movie, they participated in a questionnaire for background information and a productive vocabulary level test with 18 items. According to their level (K1000-2000: the first and second most frequent thousand words of English), 35 target words were chosen and the pre and post-tests were given. For the productive vocabulary test, the spelling test and the word association test were used. The movie The Intern was chosen and provided in English subtitle. In terms of affective domain, the questions were about the participants’ interest, motivation, confidence, and expectation of improving their English ability and of acquiring cultural knowledge. The result shows that only expectation of acquiring cultural knowledge is statistically significant (p=.019). In the spelling test, the mean score from the pre-test was relatively/quite high, and in the post-test, a slight improvement was shown. In the word association test, the participants made considerable progress from 11.07 to 20.93. When the correlation among three factors was analyzed, a significant relationship was indicated between affective domain and the word association test. Insights from the findings were discussed."
Heart Extraction and Division between Left and Right Heart from Cardiac CTA,2017,"['image segmentation', 'heart extraction', 'CTA', 'image processing', 'separating energy function']",,"In this paper, we propose an automatic segmentation method of left and right heart in computed tomography angiography (CTA) using separating energy function. First, we smooth the images by applying anisotropic diffusion filter to remove noise. Then, the volume of interest (VOI) is detected by using k-means clustering. Finally, we extract the left and right heart with separating energy function which we proposed to split the heart. We tested our method in ten CT images and they were obtained from a different patient. For the evaluation of the computational performance of the proposed method, we measured the total processing time. The average of total processing time, from first step to third step, was 14.39±1.17 s. We expect for our method to be used in cardiac diagnosis for cardiologist."
Effect and Mechanism of Sulfates on Dispersity of Polycarboxylate-type Superplasticizers,2017,"['sulfates', 'polycarboxylate-type superplasticizer', 'rheological properties', 'competitive adsorption', 'aggregation behavior', 'flocculent structure']",,"The effects of different sulfates on fluidity, yield stress, and apparent viscosity of cement paste with polycarboxylate-type superplasticizer were investigated. The results showed that sulfates with alkali ions (such as Na2SO4 and K2SO4) had a pronounced negative effect on the dispersity of PC superplasticizer, while the effect of indissolvable sulfate (such as CaSO4·2H2O) on the dispersity of PC superplasticizer was slight. The mechanism of sulfates on dispersibility of polycarboxylate superplasticizer was analyzed through zeta potential and equilibrium adsorption capacity. It was indicated that with the increase of dissolution rate and dissolution speed, and under the effects of alkali ions, the competitive adsorption between sulfate ions and polycarboxylate superplasticizer was enhanced, the absolute value of zeta potential decreased as double electrode layer was destroyed, the aggregation behavior of PC superplasticizer was boosted with larger aggregation size, and the calcium ion concentration in the interstitial solution was generated. In this way, the electrostatic repulsion of cement particles was weakened; the flocculation structure became more and stronger. Under certain shearing rate, less degree of flocculation structure was damaged, which meant the decrease of fluidity and rheological properties in cement paste."

By using the ensemble mean of five model results, future changes in climate zones and four extreme temperature events of South Korea were investigated according to Köppen-Trewartha’s classification criteria. The four temporal periods of historical (1981-2005), early future (2021-2040), middle future (2041-2070), and late future (2071-2100) were defined to examine future changes. The analysis domain was divided into 230 administrative districts of South Korea. In historical (1981-2005) period, the subtropical zones are only dominant in the southern coastal regions and Jeju island, while those tend to expand in the future periods. Depending on the RCP scenarios, the more radiative forcing results in the larger subtropical zone over South Korea in the future. The expansion of the subtropical zone in metropolitan areas is more evident than that in rural areas. In addition, the enlargement of the subtropical zone in coastal regions is more prominent than that of in inland regions. Particularly, the subtropical climate zone for the late future period of RCP8.5 scenario is significantly dominant in most South Korea. All scenarios show that cold related extreme temperature events are expected to decrease and hot related extreme temperature events to increase in late future. This study can be utilized by administrative districts for the strategic plan of responses to future climate change."
Effects of lamotrigine on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in pediatric epilepsy patients,2017,"['Child', 'Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Seizures', 'Anticonvulsants']",,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of lamotrigine for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in children with epilepsy.Methods: Pediatric patients newly diagnosed with epilepsy (n=90 [61 boys and 29 girls]; mean age, 9.1±3.4 years) were enrolled. All patients were evaluated with the Korean ADHD rating scale (K-ARS)-IV before treatment with lamotrigine and after doses had been administered. The mean interval of ADHD testing was approximately 12.3 months. The initial dosage of lamotrigine was 1 mg/kg/day (maximum 25 mg/day for the first 2 weeks), and increased by 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks until titrated up to 7 mg/kg/day (or maximum 200 mg/day).Results: The mean ADHD test score of the 90 subjects was 17.0±1.8 at baseline. It was slightly reduced to 15.6±1.7 after lamotrigine monotherapy (P>0.01). Prior to treatment, a total of 31 patients (34.4%) met the diagnostic criteria for ADHD according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision, Of these 31 patients, 27 (87.1%) had significantly improved ADHD scores with lamotrigine monotherapy (28.0±1.6 reduced to 18.1±2.6, P<0.001). Among these 27 patients, 25 (92.6%) showed normalized electroencephalogram (EEG) and 26 (96.3%) achieved total freedom from seizures within 12 months of the initiation of lamotrigine monotherapy.Conclusion: The results from our study show that lamotrigine had a positive effect in pediatric epilepsy patients by reducing ADHD symptoms, preventing seizures, and normalizing EEG. However, further research is required to determine whether lamotrigine is efficacious against ADHD symptoms independent of its effects on epileptic seizures."

This study aimed to confirm the cultural equivalence, reliability, and validity of the Korean version of Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory (K-FCRI). We conducted a forward–backward translation of the English version FCRI to Korean version through meticulous process including transcultural equivalence test. The psychometric property of the K-FCRI was then validated in 444 survivors from cancers at various sites. The Korean translation was accepted well by participants. There was a good cultural equivalence between the Korean version and the English version of FCRI. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the original seven-factor structure with slightly insufficient level of goodness-of-fit indices (comparative fit index = 0.900, non-normed fit index = 0.893, root mean square error of approximation = 0.060). The K-FCRI had high internal consistency (α = 0.85 for total scale and α = 0.77–0.87 for subscales) and test-retest reliability (r = 0.90 for total scale and r = 0.54–0.84 for subscales). The K-FCRI had significant correlations with the Korean version of Fear of Progression Questionnaire, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Version 3.0, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Fatigue Severity Score, supporting the good construct validity and psychometric properties of K-FCRI.

The Korean- Youth Self Report (K- YSR), Revised Children s Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS), Rosenberg Self- Esteem Scale (RSE) and Parent Adolescent Communication Inventory (PACI) were also included to evaluate the psychopathology of the students. Results The distribution rates of the bully, assistant, reinforcer, defender and outsider groups were 4.1%, 3.1%, 5.3%, 53.7%, and 32.0%, respectively. Among the syndrome scales of K- YSR, almost each items and the total scores (p=0.049), RCMAS (p=0.000), PACI (p=0.000), and RSE (p=0.000) were significantly different among all group. The average scores on the K- YSR and RCMAS were the highest in the assistant and reinforcer groups. Conclusion The assistant and reinforcer groups showed more severe psychopathologies. This means that they suffered from more difficulties than the other groups. Therefore, they need more intensive therapeutic interventions. Except for the defender group, who prevented bullying, the outsider group was the largest group. Therefore, a comprehensive approach that can change outsiders to defenders should be employed for the prevention of bullying in adolescents"

Automatic progressive damage detection of rotor bar in induction motor using vibration analysis and multiple classifiers,2017,"['Classification', 'DWT', 'Induction motor', 'Rotor bars', 'Vibration analysis']",,"There is an increased interest in developing reliable condition monitoring and fault diagnosis systems of machines like induction motors; such interest is not only in the final phase of the failure but also at early stages. In this paper, several levels of damage of rotor bars under different load conditions are identified by means of vibration signals. The importance of this work relies on a simple but effective automatic detection algorithm of the damage before a break occurs. The feature extraction is based on discrete wavelet analysis and autocorrelation process. Then, the automatic classification of the fault degree is carried out by a binary classification tree. In each node, comparing the learned levels of the breaking off correctly identifies the fault degree. The best results of classification are obtained employing computational intelligence techniques like support vector machines, multilayer perceptron, and the k-NN algorithm, with a proper selection of their optimal parameters."

In this paper, we propose a post-processing method for JPEG-coded image deblocking via sparse representation and adaptive residual threshold. This method includes three steps. First, we obtain the dictionary by online dictionary learning and the compressed images. The dictionary is then modified by the histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) feature descriptor and K-means cluster. Second, an adaptive residual threshold for orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) is proposed and used for sparse coding by combining blind image blocking assessment. At last, to take advantage of human visual system (HVS), the edge regions of the obtained deblocked image can be further modified by the edge regions of the compressed image. The experimental results show that our proposed method can keep the image more texture and edge information while reducing the image blocking artifacts."

Little is known about the measurement of decisional conflict, and existing measures are not suitable for all contexts. In this study, psychometric properties of the Decisional Conflict Scale, which was translated for the first time into Korean [Korean version of DCS (K-DCS)], were examined.Methods: A sample of 273 community-dwelling elders was surveyed (mean age: 77.26 years; 80.2% women). Internal consistency reliability and stability reliability were tested by calculating Cronbach a and Pearson's correlation coefficients. Exploratory factor analysis and logistic regression analyses were performed to test validity.Results: Reliability of the K-DCS was acceptable with Cronbach a =.87; test-retest correlation r = .76. Factor analysis showed a two-factor structure with nine items: informed/values clarity and uncertainty. Concordance between K-DCS and the four treatment directives was significant (kappa values .78). Controlling for age and gender, those with decision implementation were more likely to implement their decisions on tube feeding (odds ratio = 5.15, p = .033) and hospice care (odds ratio = 2.83, p = .017).Conclusion: The K-DCS appears to be a valid measure to evaluate decisional conflict about advance directives in community-dwelling Korean older adults. Further validation of the K-DCS is warranted, though caution should be exercised in using subscales because of differences in decisional contexts."

수익비용 대응과 조세회피에 관한 연구,2017,"['수익비용 대응', '조세회피', '비조세비용', '조세비용', 'degree of matching', 'tax avoidance', 'non－tax costs', 'tax costs']","본 연구는 수익비용 대응의 정도가 자본비용(비조세비용)에 음(－)의 영향을 미친다는 선행연구와 비조세비용과 조세비용 간에 상충관계가 있다는 선행연구에 근거하여 수익비용대응의 정도가 조세회피에 어떤 영향을 미치는지를 최종적으로 검증하는 것이다. 연구방법은 한국채택 국제회계기준이 전면 도입된 2011년부터 최근 공시된 2015년까지의 재무자료 등을 이용하여 다중회귀분석을 한다.연구결과를 간략히 기술하면 다음과 같다.자본비용으로 측정한 비조세비용이 높을 경우 경영자는 비조세비용과 조세비용의 상충관계로 인해 총 비용 최소화 관점에서 조세비용을 낮추는 것으로 나타났다. 조세회피와 자본비용 간의 내생성을 통제한 후 검증한 결과 자기자본 비용 및 타인자본 비용이 높을 경우에는 경영자는 조세부담(조세비용)을 낮추기 위해 유의성 있게 조세회피를 많이 하는 것으로 나타났다. 즉, 자본비용이 높을 경우 조세비용을 낮추기 위해 조세회피를 상대적으로 많이 하는 것으로 나타났다.수익비용 대응의 정도가 높으면 이익의 질이 높아져서 비조세비용인 자본비용이 낮아진다. 총 비용의 최소화를 위해 비조세비용은 조세비용에 영향을 미친다. 수익비용 대응의 정도가 높은 기업은 비조세비용이 낮아지고 비조세비용이 낮아지면 법인세 부담액(조세비용)은 높아진다. 법인세 부담액(조세비용)이 높다는 것은 상대적으로 조세회피의 정도가 낮다는 것을 의미한다. 따라서 수익비용대응의 정도는 비조세비용과 조세비용의 상충관계를 통해 조세회피에 음(－)의 영향을 미치고 있다.본 연구를 통해 수익비용 대응의 정도가 높은 기업은 비조세비용이 낮아지므로 무리하게 조세부담(조세비용)을 낮추기 위해 조세회피를 하지 않는다는 것을 확인할 수 있었다. 따라서 수익비용 대응의 정도는 비조세비용에 대한 정보력뿐만 아니라 조세회피에 대한 추가적인 정보력을 제공해 준다.","This study is based on the previous research that the degree of matching affects the capital cost(non－tax cost) negatively and there is a trade－off between the non－tax costs and the tax costs. The final result is to examine how the degree of matching affects tax avoidance. The methodology is based on multiple regression analysis using financial data from 2011, when the K－IFRS was fully adopted, to 2015, which was recently announced. We find as follows.The higher the non－tax costs measured by capital costs, the lower the tax costs in terms of minimizing total costs. The following are the result of the control of the endogeneity between the tax avoidance and the cost of capital. When the cost of debt or equity is high, the manager shows significant tax avoidance in order to lower the tax burden(tax cost). In other words, if the cost of capital is high, tax avoidance is relatively high in order to lower the tax costs.The higher the degree of matching, the higher the quality of earnings and the lower the capital cost, which is the non－tax costs. To minimize the total costs, non－tax costs affect tax costs. For firms with a high degree of matching, the non－taxable costs are lowered. If the non－taxable costs are lowered, the tax burden(tax costs) increases. A high tax burden(tax cost) means that the degree of tax avoidance is relatively low. Therefore, the degree of matching has a negative impact on tax avoidance through the trade－off between non－tax costs and tax costs.The results of this study show that firms with a high degree of matching do not tax avoidance unreasonably in order to lower the tax costs(tax burden) because the non－tax costs are lowered. Therefore, the degree of matching provides additional information on tax avoidance as well as information on non－tax costs."

Distribution of CNTs as reinforcements may be uniform or functionally graded (FG). The equivalent material properties of the composite media are obtained according to a refined rule of mixtures which contains efficiency parameters. To account for the large deformations, von Kármán type of geometrical nonlinearity is included into the formulation. The matrix representation of the governing equations is obtained according to the Ritz method where the basic shape functions are written in terms of the Chebyshev polynomials. Time dependency of the problem is eliminated by means of the Galerkin method and the resulting nonlinear eigenvalue problem is solved employing a direct displacement control approach. Results are obtained for completely clamped and completely simply supported plates. Results are first validated for the especial cases of FG-CNTRC and cross-ply laminated plates. Afterwards, parametric studies are given for FG-CNTRC plates with different boundary conditions. It is shown that, nonlinear frequencies are highly dependent to the volume fraction and dispersion profiles of CNTs. Furthermore, mode redistribution is observed in both simply supported and clamped FG-CNTRC plates."

백내장수술 시 절개방향과 각막후면 난시 변화의 연관성,2017,"['Incision location', 'Posterior corneal astigmatism', 'Surgically-induced astigmatism']","목적: 투명각막절개를 통한 백내장 초음파수정체유화술에서 절개위치에 따른 수술에 의해 유발된 후면각막난시의 변화와 전체각막난시에 미치는 영향에 대해 알아보았다.대상과 방법: 단일 술자에 의해 투명각막절개를 통해 시행된 초음파수정체유화술을 받은 환자 81명(84안)을 대상으로 연구하였다. 절개방향은 상측 혹은 이측에서 시행하였으며 자동각막굴절계 상에서 전면각막곡률이 60-120˚의 경우, 상측절개를 시행하였으며, 전면각막곡률이 0-30˚, 150-180˚의 경우, 이측절개를 시행하였다. 30-60˚, 120-150˚의 경우는 대상에서 제외하였다. 수술 전후의 자동각막굴절계와 이중샤임플러그 전안부촬영기를 이용한 각막전면, 후면 및 각막전체의 수술에 의해 유발된 난시변화(surgically induced astigmatism, SIA)를 측정하였다.결과: 총 81명(84안) 중 이측은 61안, 상측은 23안이며 자동각막굴절값(autorefractive keratometry, ARK)과 이중샤임플러그 전안부촬영기의 각막전면(simulated keratometry, Sm K), 후면(posterior keratometry, PK) 및 각막전체(total corneal power, TCP)의 모든 항목에서 이측보다 상측절개에서 SIA가 더 큰 값을 나타냈다(p<0.05). ARK의 수술 전후 난시변화는 이측절개에서는 유의한 차이는 없었으나 상측절개 시 유의하게 감소하였다(p<0.05). PK는 절개방향과 관계없이 수술 전후의 양 및 축 방향에서는 유의한 차이가 없었다. 이측절개와 상측절개 시 모두 수술 후 TCP는 수술 전 ARK, Sm K와 유의한 상관관계가 있었지만, 수술 전 PK는 수술 후 TCP에 영향을 미치지 않았다. 전체군에서는 수술 전 PK가 0.5D 이상일 경우, 후면각막의 SIA를 제외하고 모든 항목에서 SIA가 수술 전 PK가 0.5D 미만일 경우보다 유의하게 큰 값을 보였다. 이측절개 시에는 수술 전 PK가 0.5D 이상일 경우, 수술 후 SIA는 모든 항목에서 유의한 차이는 보이지 않았지만, 상측절개의 경우, 수술 전 PK가 0.5D 이상일 경우, ARK의 SIA는 유의하게 큰 값을 보였다.결론: 절개방향에 관계없이 각막후면의 SIA는 유의미한 변화가 없으므로 수술 후 각막전체의 난시를 예측할 때 각막전면의 SIA를 고려해서 수술 후 각막전면의 난시값을 예측하고 수술 전 각막후면의 난시값을 합산하는 것으로 수술 후 전체난시를 예측하는 것이 의미있을 것으로 생각된다.","Purpose: To determine if there is a difference in surgically induced astigmatism (SIA) of the posterior corneal surface between superior and temporal incision and its effect on total corneal power in patients who underwent clear corneal incision cataract surgery.Methods: A retrospective study of 81 patients (84 eyes) who underwent clear corneal incision phacoemulsification by one surgeon. Patients were divided into two groups according to the steep axis: the temporal and superior groups. Anterior, posterior and total corneal SIA (simulated keratometry [Sm K], posterior keratometry [PK] and total corneal power [TCP] respectively) were measured using autorefractive keratometry (ARK) and dual Scheimpflug imaging before and after surgery.Results: There were 61 eyes with temporal incision and 23 eyes with superior incision. The mean SIA was larger in the superior incision group than in the temporal incision group according to ARK, Sm K, PK and TCP (p < 0.05). There were no significant cylindrical changes in ARK in the temporal incision group, however, there was a significant decrease in the superior incision group before and after the operation (p < 0.05). Change in the amount and axis of PK before and after operation were not significantly different, for both incision groups. There was a significant correlation between post-operative TCP and both pre-operative ARK and Sm K for both groups. However, there was no correlation between post-operative TCP and pre-operative PK. In all patients, when pre-operative PK was more than 0.5 D, SIA-ARK, SIA-Sm K and SIA-TCP were all significantly larger than when pre-operative PK was less than 0.5 D, whereas SIA-PK was not. When pre-operative PK was more than 0.5 D, there were no significant differences in SIA-ARK, SIA-Sm K, SIA-PK or SIA-TCP in the temporal incision group. However, SIA-ARK was significantly largerin the superior incision group.Conclusions: There was no significant cylindrical change in PK before and after operation in both the temporal and superior incision groups. Therefore, when predicting post-operative TCP, it might be meaningful to consider SIA-ARK and SIA-Sm K."

With the growing trend of mobile devices, mobile cloud computing can also benefit from applying bio-inspired techniques. Energy-efficient offloading mechanisms on mobile cloud systems are needed to reduce the total energy consumption but previous works did not consider energy consumption in the decision-making of task distribution. This paper proposes the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as an offloading strategy of cloudlet to data centers where each task is represented as a particle during the process. The collected tasks are classified using K-means clustering on the cloudlet before applying PSO in order to minimize the number of particles and to locate the best data center for a specific task, instead of considering all tasks during the PSO process. Simulation results show that the proposed PSO excels in choosing data centers with respect to energy consumption, while it has accumulated a little more processing time compared to the other approaches."

Among various biofuels, biodiesel has several advantages such as less emission of air pollutants and higher cetane values compared to diesel oil.Demand for biodiesel in Korea is increasing that leads to higher dependence on the imported feedstocks. Therefore, it is important to utilize the waste materials collected domestically for biodiesel production. Food waste oil collected in waste treatment facility has not been used for biodiesel production due to high free fatty contents in the oil.In this work, biodiesel conversion of food waste oil by Amberlyst 15 was studied. Synthetic and actual food waste oils have been used in the study. First, the effects of the major operating parameters including reaction temperature, methanol to oil molar ratio and catalyst loading on the conversion rates and yields were determined with synthetic waste oil.Kinetic modelling work was also done to determine the activation energy of the reaction. From the work, optimization reaction conditions were determined to be 383K, 1: 26.1 for methanol molar ratio to oil, 10 wt.% for catalyst loading and 360 min for reaction time. Activation energy of the reaction is determined to be 29.75 kJ/mol, lower than those reported in the previous works. So the solid catalyst, Amberlyst 15, was more efficient for esterification than the solid catalysts employed in the other works. Agitation rates have the negligible effects on the conversion rates and yields. With the identified optimization conditions, conversion of the actual food waste oil was also carried out. The esterification yield of actual food waste oil in 60 min was 13% lower than that of synthetic waste oil but the final yields in 240 min were similar each other, 98.12% for synthetic oil and 97.62% for actual waste oil."

We have defined a driver's driving characteristic using z-score, which is a statistics for ascertaining the relative position in the entire distribution by normalizing the distribution. We have also presented a process of managing the speed data according to the groups that are generated by clustering drivers using the k-means clustering algorithm. Finally, we propose a new prediction method that corrects the speed for calculating destination arrival time by reflecting the driver’s driving characteristic.

The maximum ion-beam current density was measured to be 18.2 A/m$^2$ when the filament potential was 1500 V and the filament temperature was 1270 K. The estimated ion-emitting energy was 3.36 eV, meaning that the Na$^+$ ion could be easily emitted. The measured half-life times for filament temperatures of 1270 K and 1190 K were 334.7 min and 2067.6 min, respectively, meaning that this material has a very long lifetime.

희박한 데이터에 대한 선형판별분석에서 최적의 차원 수 결정,2017,"['discriminant analysis', 'sparse data', 'standardized distance', 'dimensions']","오늘날 관찰값의 개수에 비해 변수의 개수가 큰 희박한 데이터셋은 다양한 분야에서 쉽게 찾아볼 수 있고, 통계학에서 그러한 데이터셋에 대한 분석은 하나의 도전이 되어 왔다. 그러한 희박한 데이터에 대한 분류를 위해 판별분석모형들이 최근에 개발되었다. 그러한 판별분석모형들 중 하나의 접근법은 그룹들을 잘 구분해주는 차원들을 찾기를 시도하는데, 그러한 차원들은 데이터의 변수의 개수보다 훨씬 적다. 그러한 모형에서 차원의 수는 예측과 자료의 시각화를 위해 중요한 역할을 하고 일반적으로 K-묶음 교차타당성 방법에 의해 결정된다. 하지만, 희박한 데이터의 경우 K-묶음 교차타당성 방법 적용시 각 묶음에 대한 관찰값의 개수가 매우 적을 수 있기 때문에 교차타당성에 의한 차원 수 결정은 신뢰성이 떨어질 수 있다. 따라서, 본 연구에서는 그러한 희박판별분석모형에 의해 찾아진 차원들에서 각 그룹들의 평균 간의 표준화된 거리에 근거한 측도를 사용하여 최적의 차원 수를 결정하는 방법을 제안하고, 제안된 방법은 모의실험을 통해 검증된다.","Datasets with small n and large p are often found in various fields and the analysis of the datasets is still a challenge in statistics. Discriminant analysis models for such datasets were recently developed in classification problems. One approach of those models tries to detect dimensions that distinguish between groups well and the number of the detected dimensions is typically smaller than p. In such models, the number of dimensions is important because the prediction and visualization of data and can be usually determined by the K-fold cross-validation (CV). However, in sparse data scenarios, the CV is not reliable for determining the optimal number of dimensions since there can be only a few observations for each fold. Thus, we propose a method to determine the number of dimensions using a measure based on the standardized distance between the mean values of each group in the reduced dimensions. The proposed method is verified through simulations."
선박충돌 위기상황에서 선박운항자가 지각한 충돌위험도 분석,2017,"['Human error', 'Ship operator', 'Perceived ship collision risk', 'Ship encounter situation']",,"Objective: The purpose of this study is to present the basic guidelines for preventing human error by measuring and analyzing the risk of collision perceived by the ship operator in the collision risk situation by using Korea Coast Guard patrol ships. Background: In the last 5 years, 97.5% of the causes of ship collision occurred at the sea was caused by human factors. However, the rate of marine accidents due to human error has not been reduced yet. Experiments and researches on the ship operators using the ships in actual operation are rarely performed. Method: Using two K.C.G Ships on the sea, the ship measured by 30 persons who are the subject of the ship (ship operator) when both ships approach and the relative distance gradually decreases in four encounter situations, perceived ship collision risk (PSCR) data were analyzed by statistical analysis. Results: The age and boarding career of the ship operator in the situation of ship collision risks encountered a negative impact on perceived collision risk in all four opposing encounter situations S1 ($000^{\circ}$), S2 ($045^{\circ}$), S3 ($090^{\circ}$) and S4 ($135^{\circ}$) respectively. That is, the higher the age of the ship operator, the lower the perceived risk of collision and the lower the age, the higher the risk of collision. Also, there was a difference between the average of group A (20~30 years) and group B (40~50 years) according to age of the ship operators at $000^{\circ}$, $045^{\circ}$ and $090^{\circ}$ and there was no difference at $135^{\circ}$. The mean difference of the experience of boarding career was also significantly different between group A (less than 4 years) and group B (more than 5 years), but there was no significant difference at $135^{\circ}$. Conclusion: The results showed that age and boarding career of the ship operators had negative impact on perceived collision risk and there was a difference in perceived risk of collision according to age and abundance of boarding career. As a result, by focusing on the ship operators who are in the age group of 20~30 years old and have less than 4 years of experience in boarding the ship. It is expected that the effect of prevention of marine accidents can be expected by avoiding collision avoidance. Application: The results of this study can be used as policy data of related organizations to prevent human error of ship operators and as training data of training institutes."

A Novel Visualization Method for Sleep Spindles Based on Source Localization of High Density EEG,2017,"['high density EEG', 'mice', 'sleep spindles']",,"Equivalent dipole source localization is a well-established approach to localizing the electrical activity in electroencephalogram (EEG). So far, source localization has been used primarily in localizing the epileptic source in human epileptic patients. Currently, source localization techniques have been applied to account for localizing epileptic source among the epileptic patients. Here, we present the first application of source localization in the field of sleep spindle in mouse brain. The spatial distribution of cortical potential was obtained by high density EEG and then the anterior and posterior sleep spindles were classified based on the K-mean clustering algorithm. To solve the forward problem, a realistic geometry brain model was produced based on boundary element method (BEM) using mouse MRI. Then, we applied four different source estimation algorithms (minimum norm, eLORETA, sLORETA, and LORETA) to estimate the spatial location of equivalent dipole source of sleep spindles. The estimated sources of anterior and posterior spindles were plotted in a cine-mode that revealed different topographic patterns of spindle propagation. The characterization of sleep spindles may be better be distinguished by our novel visualization method."

This optimistic prospect is still valid, but consumers’ responses to smartwatch are quite different from market expectations. This study amis 1) to derive consumer types based on the perception of benefits and costs of smartwatch, 2) to analyze the differences among consumer types, and 3) to identify factors that affect consumers’ resistance and intention to adopt smartwatches. For this purpose, data was collected using a self-administrated online survey of 528 consumers and analyzed the data through k-means cluster analysis, ANOVA, and multiple regression analysis.The major findings of this study are as follows.First, the result of cluster analysis identified four distinctive consumer types according to the levels of perceived benefits and costs of smartwatch: ‘Indifferent type’(12.7%), ‘cost-centered type’(23.1%), ‘benefit-centered type’(40.7%), and ‘Ambivalent type’(23.5%). There was a significant difference in smartwatch benefits and costs perception among the consumer types.Second, antecedent variables including income level, technology readiness (TR), performance ambiguity, and expectation of new product emergence among consumer types were all significantly different. The perception of four sub-dimensions of TR was lowest in the indifferent type and the highest in the ambivalent type. Comparing the cost-centered type with the benefit-centered type, the innovativeness was high in the benefit-centered type, and the discomfort and anxiety were high in the cost-centered type. The performance ambiguity was significantly lower in the benefit-centered type than in the other three types, and the expectation of new product emergence was the lowest in the indifferent type and the highest in the ambivalent type.Third, there was a significant difference in the level of innovation resistance and intention to adopt smartwatch by consumer type. The ambivalent type, which perceives both the benefits and the costs of smartwatch as high, showed low innovation resistance and the highest intention to adopt smartwatch.Fourth, using a multiple regression analysis, this study identified variables that impact the consumers’ innovation resistance and intention to adopt smartwatch. Consumers’ innovativeness and expectation of new product emergence influenced innovation resistance negatively but influenced intention to adopt smartwatch positively. On other hand, technology anxiety influenced innovation resistance positively but influenced intention to adopt smartwatch negatively. Technology discomfort and performance ambiguity only significantly and positively affected consumer resistance to smartwatch. The intention to adopt smartwatch of the ambivalent type was significantly higher than that of the benefit-centered type, indicating the importance of ambivalent consumer group as potential user of smartwatch.This study is different from the previous studies in that it analyzes not only consumers’ positive responses to smartwatch such as perceived benefits and adoption but also negative responses such as perceived costs and innovation resistance, and investigates the relationship between antecedent and outcome variables. This study has the theoretical implications in terms of expanding the discussion on technology and consumers, and has practical implications for contributing to the understanding of potential consumers and subdivision markets of innovative products including smartwatch."

The 850 $\mu$m imaging data were obtained by the SCUBA-2 on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope(JCMT) for three days in July 2015 with an integration time of 6.1 hours, covering a circular area with a radius of 15$'$. We choose the central area up to a radius of $9\farcm15$ for the study, where the noise distribution is relatively uniform. The root mean square (rms) noise at the center is 2.7 mJy. We identify 17 sources with S/N $>$ 3.5. Differential number count is estimated in flux range between 3.5 and 9.0 mJy after applying various corrections derived by imaging simulations, which is consistent with previous studies. For detailed study on the individual sources, we select three sources with more reliable measurements (S/N $>$ 4.5), and construct their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from optical to far-infrared band. Redshift distribution of the sources ranges from 0.36 to 3.28, and their physical parameters are extracted using MAGPHYS model, which yield infrared luminosity $L_{IR}$ = $10^{11.3}$$-$$10^{13.4}$ $ L_{\odot}$, star formation rate SFR = $10^{1.3}$$-$$10^{3.2}$ $M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ and dust temperature $T_{D}$ = 30$-$53 K.

Analysis of dimensions and shapes of maxillary and mandibular dental arch in Korean young adults,2017,"['Dental arch dimension', 'Dental arch shape', 'Dental arch form', 'Korean adult']",,"PURPOSE. The aim of this study was to investigate dental arch dimensions and to classify arch shape in Korean young adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS. The sample included 50 Koreans with age ranging from 24 to 32 years. Maxillary and mandibular casts were fabricated using irreversible hydrocolloid and type III dental stones. Incisor-canine distance, $incisor-1^{st}$ molar distance, $incisor-2^{nd}$ molar distance, intercanine distance, $inter-1^{st}$ molar distance, and $inter-2^{nd}$ molar distance in both the maxillary and mandibular arch were measured using a three-dimensional measuring device. The dental arch was classified into three groups using five ratios from the measured values by the K-means clustering method. The data were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance. RESULTS. Arch lengths (IM2D, $incisal-2^{nd}$ molar distance) were 44.13 mm in the maxilla and 40.40 mm in the mandible. Arch widths (M2W, inter $2^{nd}$ molar width) were 64.12 mm in the maxilla and 56.37 mm in the mandible. Distribution of the dental arch form was mostly ovoid shape (maxilla 52% and mandible 56%), followed by the V-shape and the U-shape. The arch width for the U-shape was broader than for the other forms. CONCLUSION. This study establishes new reference data for dental arch dimensions for young Korean adults. The most common arch form is the ovoid type in the maxilla and mandible of Koreans. Clinicians should be aware of these references and classify arch type before and during their dental treatment for effective and harmonized results in Koreans."

As a result, infant motivation types were classified into 3 clusters. As for the motivation types of cluster 1, internal motivation was significantly outstanding while external motivation and internal motivation were quite insignificant. Internal motivation of cluster 2 was as low as a half of those of cluster 1 and cluster 3. External motivation and no-motivation as well were lower than those of cluster 3. Internal motivation of cluster 3 was similar to that of cluster 1, but the level of no-motivation was the highest. Accordingly, in this study, cluster 1 is called the high internal motivation type, cluster 2 the low motivation type, and cluster 3 the complex motivation type, respectively, to represent the attributes of the clusters. As a result of analyzing the differences among the cluster types depending on the sex and age, it was determined that there was no significant difference depending on the sex and age of the infant. As a case study on the clusters of motivation types, anecdote recordings were conducted for 12 weeks and analyzed systematically. As a result, it was determined that young children in the high internal motivation type cluster were seeking self-satisfaction and satisfying their internal curiosity while young children in the low motivation type were following the instruction of others and expected extrinsic rewards. Young children in the complex motivation type cluster were sensitive to external stimuli and would act at a moderate level."

In this study, the physico - chemical properties of gray - white and reddish brown beds are investigated. The mean grain size of the particles was less than 4φ in both layers and the reddish brown layer was more coarse. The results shows that the sorting of the grayish white layer is better. The chemical composition of both layers shows that the average concentration of SiO2, Al2O3 and K2O of the grayish white layer was higher than those of the reddish brown layer. The concentration of Fe2O3 of reddish brown lyaer was 3 times higher than those of the grayish white layer. The degree of chemical weathering (CIA) is 90 or so in both the reddish brown and grayish white layers, indicating a significant level of chemical weathering. In conclusion, reddish brown layers had been formed by the processes related to the migration of iron and the migration of water that induced aggregation after the formation of sediments (psudo-gleization).In this study area, a vertical layer of grayish white which cuts off horizontal reddish brown and grayish white color was found.

The Korean Wave literally meaning the ""flow of Korea"" is broadly divided into the ""cultural phenomenon"" and the"" economic phenomenon"" from a perspective of taking a look at it. In consequence, the traditional Korean Wave revolving around the popular culture is referred to as the ""cultural Korean Wave"" and the phenomenon of getting the image of Korean enhanced through electronic industry and smartphone industry is defined as the ""economic Korean Wave"". On the one hand, KOTRA has presented the concept of the ""business Korean Wave"" for the purpose of take-off from the economic Korean Wave to the ""business Korean Wave"".  The total amount of exports of industries related to the Korean Wave recently surveyed by region accounts for USD 5,460,000,000. Like this, the Korean Wave of popular culture products manufactured in Korea is sweeping over the whole world beyond Asia. It has revolved around dramas, films, K-pop and then extended to the living culture focused on food culture. Naturally, the question could exist as to whether or not the diffusion of the Korean Wave is the global phenomenon or whether or not the Korean Wave can continue to last in the future. But the Korean popular culture, which had long belonged to the unknown cultural backwater from the dimension of cultural exchanges in modern and contemporary world history, has exercised this influence over the world for the recent 20 years, which would an important research subject for researchers.  Analytic articles of this Korean Wave have been presented later compared to the beginning of the Korean Wave, but 526 articles are found to have been presented in important academic journals up to 2013. For the purpose of writing this paper, an attempt was made to search the Korean Wave only in one site of RISS as of May, 2017. As a result, it brought about 2390 theses and dissertations, 4686 papers in domestic academic journals, 2638 books and 103 research reports. In addition, it brought 45 articles in English and 23 books in English about the Korean Wave.  It indicates that with the popularity of the Korean Wave, researchers have poured out their research products. This study puts emphasis on the importance of humanistic research on the Korean Wave in this situation and presents that the Association of Human Contents needs to take the lead in performing its role among other things. In addition, it presents the plan for revitalization of the humanities of the Korean Wave in terms of the policy research of national agencies related to academic research.  The final goal of the humanities of the Korean Wave can not be a realistic goal of revitalizing the Korean Wave industry or increasing the role of the humanities. It will be the common goodness of mankind, humanization and human liberation as the researchers have set as the goal of humanity contents. Therefore, the humanities of Korean Wave will ultimately turn the Korean Wave into one of the human assets that heals the minds of the world people beyond the national dimension of Korea."
Flower Recognition System Using OpenCV on Android Platform,2017,,,"New mobile phones with high tech-camera and a large size memory have been recently launched and people upload pictures of beautiful scenes or unknown flowers in SNS. This paper develops a flower recognition system that can get information on flowers in the place where mobile communication is not even available. It consists of a registration part for reference flowers and a recognition part based on OpenCV for Android platform. A new color classification method using RGB color channel and K-means clustering is proposed to reduce the recognition processing time. And ORB for feature extraction and Brute-Force Hamming algorithm for matching are used. We use 12 kinds of flowers with four color groups, and 60 images are applied for reference DB design and 60 images for test. Simulation results show that the success rate is 83.3% and the average recognition time is 2.58 s on Huawei ALEUL00 and the proposed system is suitable for a mobile phone without a network."

Here, we conduct a simulation to show that initial nodes of LVQ based on the SOL algorithm performs better in finding optimal nonlinear decision borders than the ones based on the K-mean clustering method. When data with nonlinear decision borders include missing values, imputation can be implemented to fill in missing values. A simulation is conducted to compare the performance of the LVQ method utilizing SOM when missing values are imputed by mean imputation, hotdeck imputation, and a model based imputation.

Analysis of dimensions and shapes of maxillary and mandibular dental arch in Korean young adults,2017,"['Dental arch dimension', 'Dental arch shape', 'Dental arch form', 'Korean adult']",,"PURPOSE. The aim of this study was to investigate dental arch dimensions and to classify arch shape in Korean young adults.MATERIALS AND METHODS. The sample included 50 Koreans with age ranging from 24 to 32 years. Maxillary and mandibular casts were fabricated using irreversible hydrocolloid and type III dental stones. Incisor-canine distance, incisor-1st molar distance, incisor-2nd molar distance, intercanine distance, inter-1st molar distance, and inter-2nd molar distance in both the maxillary and mandibular arch were measured using a threedimensional measuring device. The dental arch was classified into three groups using five ratios from the measured values by the K-means clustering method. The data were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance.RESULTS. Arch lengths (IM2D, incisal-2nd molar distance) were 44.13 mm in the maxilla and 40.40 mm in the mandible. Arch widths (M2W, inter 2nd molar width) were 64.12 mm in the maxilla and 56.37 mm in the mandible. Distribution of the dental arch form was mostly ovoid shape (maxilla 52% and mandible 56%), followed by the V-shape and the U-shape. The arch width for the U-shape was broader than for the other forms.CONCLUSION. This study establishes new reference data for dental arch dimensions for young Korean adults. The most common arch form is the ovoid type in the maxilla and mandible of Koreans. Clinicians should be aware of these references and classify arch type before and during their dental treatment for effective and harmonized results in Koreans."

The Scale for Outcomes in Parkinson’s disease-Autonomic (SCOPA-AUT) was developed to evaluate and quantify autonomic symptoms in PD. The goal of this study was to translate the original SCOPA-AUT, which was written in English, into Korean and to evaluate its reliability and validity for Korean PD patients. Methods: For the translation, the following processes were performed: forward translation, backward translation, expert review, pretest of the pre-final version and development of the final Korean version of SCOPA-AUT (K-SCOPA-AUT). In total, 127 patients with PD from 31 movement disorder clinics of university-affiliated hospitals in Korea were enrolled in this study. All patients were assessed using the K-SCOPA-AUT and other motor, non-motor, and quality of life scores. Test-retest reliability for the K-SCOPA-AUT was assessed over a time interval of 10−14 days. Results: The internal consistency and reliability of the K-SCOPA-AUT was 0.727 as measured by the mean Cronbach’s α-coefficient. The test-retest correlation reliability was 0.859 by the Guttman split-half coefficient. The total K-SCOPA-AUT score showed a positive correlation with other non-motor symptoms [the Korean version of non-motor symptom scale (KNMSS)], activities of daily living (Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale part II) and quality of life [the Korean version of Parkinson’s Disease Quality of Life 39 (K-PDQ39)]. Conclusion: The K-SCOPA-AUT had good reliability and validity for the assessment of autonomic dysfunction in Korean PD patients. Autonomic symptom severities were associated with many other motor and non-motor impairments and influenced quality of life."
Uncertainty Assessment: Relative versus Absolute Point Dose Measurement for Patient Specific Quality Assurance in EBRT,2017,"['Uncertainty', 'EBRT', 'IMRT', 'Point dose', 'QA']",,"Verification of dose distribution is an essential part of ensuring the treatment planning system's (TPS) calculated dose will achieve the desired outcome in radiation therapy. Each measurement have uncertainty associated with it. It is desirable to reduce the measurement uncertainty. A best approach is to reduce the uncertainty associated with each step of the process to keep the total uncertainty under acceptable limits. Point dose patient specific quality assurance (QA) is recommended by American Association of Medical Physicists (AAPM) and European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO) for all the complex radiation therapy treatment techniques. Relative and absolute point dose measurement methods are used to verify the TPS computed dose. Relative and absolute point dose measurement techniques have a number of steps to measure the point dose which includes chamber cross calibration, electrometer reading, chamber calibration coefficient, beam quality correction factor, reference conditions, influences quantities, machine stability, nominal calibration factor (for relative method) and absolute dose calibration of machine. Keeping these parameters in mind, the estimated relative percentage uncertainty associated with the absolute point dose measurement is 2.1% (k=1). On the other hand, the relative percentage uncertainty associated with the relative point dose verification method is estimated to 1.0% (k=1). To compare both point dose measurement methods, 13 head and neck (H&N) IMRT patients were selected. A point dose for each patient was measured with both methods. The average percentage difference between TPS computed dose and measured absolute relative point dose was 1.4% and 1% respectively. The results of this comparative study show that while choosing the relative or absolute point dose measurement technique, both techniques can produce similar results for H&N IMRT treatment plans. There is no statistically significant difference between both point dose verification methods based upon the t-test for comparing two means."
Alterations of White Matter Integrity in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Tract-Based Analysis Using TRActs Constrained by UnderLying Anatomy,2017,['Diffusion Tensor Imaging White Matter Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease'],,"Purpose: To investigate structural brain changes and their relationship with cognitive function by determining the alterations of white matter integrity and changes in hippocampal volume that occur during chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Materials and Methods: Diffusion tensor images and 3D-T1 MR images were acquired in 13 male nonhypoxemic COPD patients and 13 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Global probabilistic tractography was used to assess a total of 18 major tracts. We examined the association between the hippocampal volume and diffusivity parameters of white matter tracts.Results: A significant difference in diffusion parameters between groups was identified for 11 white matter bundles (p < 0.05). No association was demonstrated between the normalized hippocampus volume and diffusion parameters among the participants. Significant associations between Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (KMMSE) scores and diffusivities were found for six tracts (p < 0.05). Of note, the mean diffusivity (MD) and redial diffusivity (RD) of the left superior longitudinal fasciculus parietal segment showed a significant negative correlation with the K-MMSE score (MD: r = -0.623, p = 0.001; RD: r = -0.408, p = 0.048).Conclusion: Altered white matter integrity was demonstrated across regional white matter bundles, including the superior longitudinal fasciculus, in COPD patients, and it was related to cognitive function. Changes in the volume of the hippocampus should be investigated in further studies."

For gathering the data, surveys were distributed at university in Kyungsangbuk-do. K-means cluster analysis was performed to identify types of behavior, and I applied the causal-steps approach described by Baron and Kenny(1986) for testifying the mediating effects.. The findings are as follow. 1) The types of use behavior could be classified into ‘the spectators(30.3%)’, ‘the joiners(27.2%)’, ‘the creators(23.8%)’, and ‘the inactives(18.6%)’. 2) To explore what motivates users to use social media, the study ran factor analysis to determine the potential groupings of 18 items. The analysis yielded four factors: learning motive(factor1), recognition motive(factor2), social relation motive(factor3), and sharing information with others(factor4), 3) The types of use behavior could be a partial mediating variable on the relationship between use motive and satisfaction as learning media among social studies pre-service teachers. The paper includes theoretical implications, a discussion of the study’s limitations and suggestions for future research."
An Improved Cat Swarm Optimization Algorithm Based on Opposition-Based Learning and Cauchy Operator for Clustering,2017,"['Cat Swarm Optimization', 'Cauchy Mutation Operator', 'Clustering', 'Opposition-Based Learning', 'Particle Swarm Optimization']",,"Clustering is a NP-hard problem that is used to find the relationship between patterns in a given set of patterns. It is an unsupervised technique that is applied to obtain the optimal cluster centers, especially in partitioned based clustering algorithms. On the other hand, cat swarm optimization (CSO) is a new meta-heuristic algorithm that has been applied to solve various optimization problems and it provides better results in comparison to other similar types of algorithms. However, this algorithm suffers from diversity and local optima problems. To overcome these problems, we are proposing an improved version of the CSO algorithm by using opposition-based learning and the Cauchy mutation operator. We applied the opposition-based learning method to enhance the diversity of the CSO algorithm and we used the Cauchy mutation operator to prevent the CSO algorithm from trapping in local optima. The performance of our proposed algorithm was tested with several artificial and real datasets and compared with existing methods like K-means, particle swarm optimization, and CSO. The experimental results show the applicability of our proposed method."

Aristotle, Montesquieu, and Hegel established the notion of oriental despotism as anti-these to recognize and defend the political community of free citizen, polis in case of Aristotle, division of powers and the rule of law as the principle of democracy in case of Montesquieu, and history of the democratic civil society in Europe through the realization of freedom in case of Hegel. The Japanese translated absolutism and despotism in the process of studying the modern political system and designing their political system after opening doors to the Western world. The debates about bureaucratic jeonjai(專制) after 1874 made this Chinese character the prime translated word about monarchy. After 1897 the King Gojong(高宗) and the royal party uesd jeonjai to strengthen the royal authority, and this Chinese character was connected to the translated word of absolutism. After colonization the critical viewpoint about Joseon dynasty and Japan’s change in translation made jeonjai mean despotism usually.The political system of Joseon dynasty was an absolutism where kings could act without institutional constraints but were limited by law and bureaucracy based on Confucian morals and the principle of public. K. A. Wittfogel’s concept, the oriental despotism of total power absent of effective constitutional and societal checks does not fit the Chinese and Korean dynasties. Joseon and Chinese dynasties achieved a developed type of absolutism, early modern absolutisms like European states. They had bureaucratic states with royal sovereignty. The Joseon state had weakness in social and political pluralism and civil law compared to European absolutism. Europe established the more developed political system passing Enlightenment period."
Coumarin Variation in Iranian Biennial Melilotus Genetic Resources and its Relationship with Agro-morphophenological Traits,2017,"['iversity', 'forage yield', 'gene bank', 'multivariate methods', 'sweet clover']",,"Most of Melilotus Miller species, a forage legume, contain coumarin, an unfavorable component in their shoot. There is no information concerning coumarin on Iranian Melilotus germplasms. It is crucial for plant breeders to know the concentration of this component in the breeding materials, its relationship with other traits and with genotype geographic origin. In a two-year field study a total of 196 accessions of biennial Melilotus were planted in two replications in March 2014. Thirty-nine agro-morphobiochemical traits were recorded according to standard descriptors. Fluorescencemetery assay was applied to detect free, conjugated, and total coumarin concentrations in plant leaves. The data were subjected to correlation, path, regression, factor, and cluster analyses. Total coumarin concentration varied from 0.09 to 5.27% of leaf dry weight (LDW) with a mean of 1.63 ± 0.08% of LDW among accessions. In M. officinalis, correlation analysis showed no significant correlation between coumarin concentration and cotyledon, hypocotyl, and stem colors. Therefore, no early predicting trait was determined to estimate coumarin concentration in the early growth phases of the germplasms. A positive linear relationship between leaf area and total coumarin concentration was observed by path and regression analyses. Based on factor analysis and extracted bi-plot, the scatter of accessions with low coumarin and high forage yield was determined. Materials were divided into three groups by k-means cluster analysis. There was no clear pattern between coumarin concentration and genotype geographic origin. The findings could be utilized by Melilotus breeders to apply in their breeding programs."

빠알리어 시제에 관한 『깟짜야나 문법』과『목갈라나 문법』의 규칙 분석,2017,"['tense in Pāli', 'Kaccāyana-vyākaraṇa', 'Moggallāna-Vyākaraṇa', 'tense suffix', 'grammatical rule', '빠알리어 시제', '『깟짜야나 문법』', '『목갈라나 문법』', '시제 어미', '문법규칙']","본 연구는 대표적인 빠알리어 전통문법서인 『깟짜야나 문법(KV)』과 『목갈라나 문법(MV)』이 동사의 시제를 어떻게 다루는지 알아보기 위해 관련된 문법규칙을 분석한 것이다. 분석결과를 요약하면 다음과 같다.첫째, KV와 MV 모두 빠알리어 시제를 3종의 과거, 현재, 미래 이렇게 총 다섯 가지로 동일하게 구분하지만, 전개방식에 있어서 KV는 각 시제의 정의와 해당 시제 어미를 다른 규칙으로 분리해서 다루고, MV는 한 규칙으로 묶어 제시한다.둘째, 두 문법서가 제시하는 시제의 용어가 그 시제를 정의하는 핵심단어라는 점은 동일하지만, 서로 다른 용어를 사용한다. 과거시제의 일반적인 용어로 KV는 atīta를, MV는 bhūta를 사용하고, 세 가지 유형으로서의 과거시제 용어도 같지 않다. 현재시제의 용어로 KV는 paccuppanna를, MV는 vattamāna를 사용한다. 미래시제의 용어로 KV는 anāgata를, MV는 bhavissati를 사용한다.셋째, 두 문법서는 규칙의 간결성을 위해 시제 어미군의 용어를 사용하는데, KV가 ajjatanī, hiyyattanī, parokkhā, vattamānā, bhavissantī와 같이 그 시제를 의미하는 단어를 사용한다면, MV는 ī-ādayo, ā-ādayo, a-ādayo, tyādayo, ssatyādayo와 같이 시제 어미군의 첫 어미에 ‘ādi’를 결합한 실용적인 단어를 사용한다.넷째, 시제 어미군의 활용범위에 대해 KV는 해당 시제만 제시하는 반면, MV는 화자의 의지에 따라 시제 간에 시제 어미들을 바꾸어 사용하는 ‘시제불일치(kālabyattayo)’의 경우와 시제와 관계없는 문장 내 활용의 경우도 제시한다.","The purpose of the present paper is to analyse the grammatical rules for Kaccāyana-Vyākaraṇa(KV) and Moggallāna-Vyākaraṇa(MV) with reference to Pāli Tense. KV presents 10 rules related to tense in a chapter called ‘ākhyāta-kappa’ and MV does 6 rules in a chapter called ‘chaṭṭho kaṇḍo’. As a result of the comparative analysis of those rules, the following points are observed: Firstly, with regard to the arrangement of the related rules, KV deals with the tense suffix separately from the definition of tense in different rules, while MV deals with the tense suffix together with the definition of tense in one rule. Despite the different arrangement of the rules, both KV and MV classify Pāli tense into five kinds, viz., three past tenses, one present tense, and one future tense.Secondly, in respect of the technical term for a tense, both KV and MV use significant word conveying the meaning of a particular tense. The terms that those grammars use are as follows. For the general terms of past tense, KV and MV use atīta and bhūta, respectively. For the terms of three types of past tense, ajjapabhuti atīta(past tense beginning with today) in KV corresponds to bhūta(general past tense) in MV; hiyyoppabhuti atīta(past tense before yesterday) in KV corresponds to anajjatana bhūta(past tense except today) in MV; and apaccakkha atīta(past tense beyond speakers’ perception) in KV corresponds to parokkha bhūtānajjatana(past tense beyond speakers’ perception except today) in MV. KV and MV use the term paccuppanna and vattamāna to denote the present tense, respectively. And KV and MV use the term anāgata and bhavissati to denote the future tense, respectively.Thirdly, both KV and MV use the technical term of the tense suffix for the sake of concise and efficient expression. The terms that those two grammars use are as follows. KV provides the terms ajjatanī, hiyyattanī, parokkhā, vattamānā, and bhavissantī for the group of tense suffixes, implying the meaning of each tense. Unlike KV, MV provides the terms ī-ādayo, ā-ādayo, a-ādayo, tyādayo, ssatyādayo for the group of tense suffixes, by joining the initial suffix of the particular suffix group to the functional word ‘ādi(beginning with, and so forth).’ Fourthly, with respect to sphere of application for the tense suffix, KV presents the application of those, limiting the related tense only, while MV presents wider application of those such as the contrariety or change of time(kālabyattayo) and the use in a sentence that is irrelevant to tense."

Focusing on the recent popularity of trip to Taiwan, I tried to analyze what Taiwan means to Korean travelers. More specifically, I would like to find some cultural patterns of their travel style in Taiwan and analyze what kind of images are constructed for Taiwan through travel, and what factors affect image formation.Since 2010, there has been an increase in the number of Koreans going to Taiwan for travel. This trend is affected by the growing interest in Taiwan after the release of some modern Taiwanese films in Korea, positive attitude based on the popularity of K-Pop and Korean popular culture, and a little bit cheap price of goods and foods in Taiwan.Most of Korean tourists in Taiwan get information about their trips mainly through the Internet. The fact that travelers depend on very similar information via the Internet makes them traveling on a routinized schedule and consuming similar products. Although travelers are aware of this situation, it is believed that it creates the experiential value of the tourist site.Korean tourists think Taiwan is clean and the Taiwanese are friendly compared to mainland China, but they have a strong resistance to the ‘scent of Taiwan’, which is unfamiliar to Koreans. This leads to an attitude that the local traditional culture is difficult to accept easily. Moreover, many Korean travelers do not have much interest in the past situation and the history of places where they visit. This is the cultural attitude to Taiwan which Korean tourists have."

Thus, this study examines determinants and consequences of classifying interest and dividend received as investing cash flows and interest paid as financing cash flows. Based on Korean firms that adopted IFRS in 2011, we find that firms tend to classify interest and dividend received as investing cash flows and interest paid as financing cash flows when the sum of interest paid and dividend paid is greater than the sum of interest received and dividend received. Also, the results reveal that firms classify interest and dividend received as investing activities and interest paid as financing activities when investing cash flows under K-GAAP are lower than the industry mean and when there exist analysts forecasting operating cash flows of the firm. Furthermore, we find that the value-relevance of operating cash flows increases as interest and dividend received are classified as investing cash flows and interest paid is classified as financing cash flows. This suggests that classifying interest and dividend in conformity with their economic substance improves the quality of information contents of operating cash flows."

One key player in these negotiations was Wu Jianzhang, a Cantonese merchant who became circuit intendant of the Shanghai region. Wu, however, also had links to Cantonese sailors and anti- Qing secret societies. When the Small Swords Society took Shanghai in 1853, he found himself entangled in conflicting responsibilities and networks. Foreign traders and Chinese officials regarded Wu, like other middlemen on the Chinese coast, with a mixture of respect and distrust.Wu’s situation, however, was not unique to the mid-nineteenth century. This article compares Wu to other intermediaries who played similar roles in the sixteenth and late nineteenth centuries, in order to show the ways in which Wu, his predecessors, and those who followed in his footsteps connected China to the wider world by navigating the treacherous waters of diplomacy, war, and commerce. The work of John K. Fairbank, who in the 1950s pioneered the study of such people as Wu Jianzhang, can find new meaning in the twenty-first century, enabling us to understand the transnational implications of China’s local social history."

With an addition of acetophenone (C6H5COCH3), however, the protein leaking decreases, which means that the addition of acetophenone (C6H5COCH3) reduces hair damage at hair coloring.In terms of the wash fastness of dyed hair by solvent, K/S reduction rate rose as washing frequency increased.When acetophenone (C6H5COCH3) was added, the K/S reduction rate was low and relatively stable, revealing high wash fastness. In contrast, light fastness was low in all solvents."
시니어관광객의 추구편익에 따른 시장세분화,2017,"['Senior tourist', 'Market segmentation', 'Sought benefit', 'Mixture model', '시니어관광객', '시장세분화', '추구편익']",,"Due to environmental changes, aging populations are growing rapidly in both developing and developed countries. Therefore, when senior citizens are emerging as a new bluesumer, it is very crucial to identify the needs, interests, and wants of the elderly. In South Korea, for instance, senior citizens are considered to be over 55 years old. Because the population is not growing, senior citizens’ health and quality of life are very important in different sectors since different age groups have different preferences. Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine the effects of senior citizens on the tourism industry. We begin by segmenting the senior tourist market in South Korea by sought benefit using a mixture model to solve the problems identified by previous studies that used K-means clustering analysis. Statistical analysis was also done. As a result, a total of four segmentations were characterized by the four clusters derived by the BIC value. Clusters were labeled appreciate nature-seeking type, break-seeking type, various benefits-seeking type, and experience-seeking type. Each cluster showed distinct characteristics, and the sought benefits by age were different. This study provides several important practical and empirical implications for tourism development direction and application of marketing strategies to target senior tourists."

Methods : A combined treatment of auditory training and sensory integration therapy was implemented to 3 children aged 4 to 7 and diagnosed with developmental delay during 9 weeks period from December 2016 to January 2017. ABA' design which is one of single subject research designs was used in this study. Baseline A had 4 sessions, intervention B had 15 sessions, and baseline A’ had 4 sessions, so 23 sessions were applied in total. During the baseline A and A 'periods, visual perception ability was measured by K-DTVP-2 (Korea Developmental Test Visual Perception-2) and sensory processing ability was evaluated by sensory profile. The maintenance time of attention was measured with the absence of intervention for the baseline period, and for the intervention period, it was measured at 10 minutes break time which was provided after the intervention. The children’s attention time during a fine motor task provided were measured using video recorder with the interval recording method, and the interval for the evaluation was 30 seconds. Results : No statistically significant difference were found in the visual perception function and sensory processing scores before and after treatment. Attention of participant A enhanced significantly while that of participant B and C did not improve significantly. Conclusion : It is hard to conclude that sensory integration therapy combined with auditory perception training has positive effects on visual perception function and attention of children with developmental delays. However, there were significant increase in attention and improvements in behavior related to sensory processing for some cases in this study. In further study, longer intervention periods and valid measurement need to be applied in order to get better results. And it is proposed that more studies need to be done to enhance evidence of auditory perception training as a mean to facilitate attention and to prepare learning."

In this paper, as an image steganography method which uses images as media, we propose a new block matching method that embeds information into the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) domain. The proposed method, based on a statistical analysis, reduces loss of embedding capacity due to inequable use of candidate blocks. It works in such a way that computes the variance of each candidate block, preserves candidate blocks with high frequency components while reducing candidate blocks with low frequency components by compressing them exploiting the k-means clustering algorithm. Compared with the previous block matching method, the proposed method can reconstruct secret images with similar PSNRs while embedding higher-capacity information."

The modified abdominal draw-in maneuver included a posterior pelvic tilt, a traditional abdominal draw-in maneuver, and a vibration sensory feedback device. Voluntary abdominal contraction using the vibration sensory feedback device was performed by the subjects for more than 1 hour per day, 5 times per week, for 6 weeks along with common low back pain treatment. Electromyographic signals in the rectus abdominis (RA), external oblique (EO), internal oblique (IO), and erector spinae (ES) muscles were measured to compare muscle activation. The degree of pain was measured using the visual analogue scale (VAS), and functional capacity was measured using the Korea Oswestry Disability Index (K-ODI). All results were compared to the means before and after intervention.Results: After the intervention, the RA, EO, and IO showed increased muscle activation and the ES showed decreased muscle activation. The visual analogue scale decreased after intervention and the K-ODI decreased after intervention.Conclusion: Modified abdominal draw-in maneuvers in daily life combined with therapeutic exercises may be effective in relieving pain and dysfunctions in chronic low back pain patients."
Demineralized Bone Matrix (DBM) as a Bone Void Filler in Lumbar Interbody Fusion : A Prospective Pilot Study of Simultaneous DBM and Autologous Bone Grafts,2017,"['Arthrodesis', 'Autograft', 'Bone substitutes', 'CT scan', 'Osteoporosis', 'Spinal fusion']",,"Objective : Solid bone fusion is an essential process in spinal stabilization surgery. Recently, as several minimally invasive spinal surgeries have developed, a need of artificial bone substitutes such as demineralized bone matrix (DBM), has arisen. We investigated the in vivo bone growth rate of DBM as a bone void filler compared to a local autologous bone grafts. Methods : From April 2014 to August 2015, 20 patients with a one or two-level spinal stenosis were included. A posterior lumbar interbody fusion using two cages and pedicle screw fixation was performed for every patient, and each cage was packed with autologous local bone and DBM. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) of leg pain and back pain and the Korean Oswestry Disability Index (K-ODI). Clinical outcome parameters and range of motion (ROM) of the operated level were collected preoperatively and at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively. Computed tomography was performed 1 year after fusion surgery and bone growth of the autologous bone grafts and DBM were analyzed by ImageJ software. Results : Eighteen patients completed 1 year of follow-up, including 10 men and 8 women, and the mean age was 56.4 (32-71). The operated level ranged from L3/4 to L5/S1. Eleven patients had single level and 7 patients had two-level repairs. The mean back pain NRS improved from 4.61 to 2.78 (p=0.003) and the leg pain NRS improved from 6.89 to 2.39 (p<0.001). The mean K-ODI score also improved from 27.33 to 13.83 (p<0.001). The ROM decreased below 2.0 degrees at the 3-month assessment, and remained less than 2 degrees through the 1 year postoperative assessment. Every local autologous bone graft and DBM packed cage showed bone bridge formation. On the quantitative analysis of bone growth, the autologous bone grafts showed significantly higher bone growth compared to DBM on both coronal and sagittal images (p<0.001 and p=0.028, respectively). Osteoporotic patients showed less bone growth on sagittal images. Conclusion : Though DBM alone can induce favorable bone bridging in lumbar interbody fusion, it is still inferior to autologous bone grafts. Therefore, DBM is recommended as a bone graft extender rather than bone void filler, particularly in patients with osteoporosis."

Choi In-ho published “The City of Someone Else Familiar” about forty years after the publication of “Other’s room”. These two novels are closely interrelated and need to be studied as one piece of problematic work describing the theme of problem consciousness that penetrates both novels. Both novels deal with events that became unfamiliar after their place suddenly lost their meaning. To reveal the issue of problem consciousness of these two novels is to find the direct and implied meaning connoted by the loss of the place character surrounding a character. “Other’s room” and “The City of Someone Else Familiar” are novel series that showcase the process of finding a lost self in material society through the process of transformation into the divine space. “The City of Someone Else Familiar” deals with the process of self-discovery more closely by expanding the spatial background that is confined to the private space to the public space. This novel is a problematic work that has been actively practiced by the artist’s consciousness that Choi In-ho had previously. If “He” in “Other’s room” becomes a stone statue, then “K” in “The City of Someone Else Familiar” realizes his self-integration in the process of trying to regain his self. In this sense, the “The City of Someone Else Familiar” is a novel that actively utilizes the concept of “place” as a space of perception through spatial appropriation."
An Improved Cat Swarm Optimization Algorithm Based on Opposition-Based Learning and Cauchy Operator for Clustering,2017,"['Cat Swarm Optimization', 'Cauchy Mutation Operator', 'Clustering', 'Opposition-Based Learning', 'Particle Swarm Optimization']",,"Clustering is a NP-hard problem that is used to find the relationship between patterns in a given set of patterns. It is an unsupervised technique that is applied to obtain the optimal cluster centers, especially in partitioned based clustering algorithms. On the other hand, cat swarm optimization (CSO) is a new meta-heuristic algorithm that has been applied to solve various optimization problems and it provides better results in comparison to other similar types of algorithms. However, this algorithm suffers from diversity and local optima problems. To overcome these problems, we are proposing an improved version of the CSO algorithm by using opposition-based learning and the Cauchy mutation operator. We applied the opposition-based learning method to enhance the diversity of the CSO algorithm and we used the Cauchy mutation operator to prevent the CSO algorithm from trapping in local optima. The performance of our proposed algorithm was tested with several artificial and real datasets and compared with existing methods like K-means, particle swarm optimization, and CSO. The experimental results show the applicability of our proposed method."
분할 정복법을 이용한 Haskell GC 조정 시간 개선,2017,['GC'],,"The performance improvement of a single core processor has reached its limit since the circuit density cannot be increased any longer due to overheating. Therefore, the multicore and manycore architectures have emerged as viable approaches and parallel programming becomes more important. Haskell, a purely functional language, is getting popular in this situation since it naturally supports parallel programming owing to its beneficial features including the implicit parallelism in evaluating expressions and the monadic tools supporting parallel constructs. However, the performance of Haskell parallel programs is strongly influenced by the performance of the run-time system including the garbage collector. Though a memory profiling tool namely GC-tune has been suggested, we need a more systematic way to use this tool. Since GC-tune finds the optimal memory size by executing the target program with all the different possible GC options, the GC-tuning time takes too long. This paper suggests a basic divide-and-conquer method to reduce the number of GC-tune executions by reducing the search area by one-quarter for every searching step. Applying this method to two parallel programs, a maximally independent set and a K-means programs, the memory tuning time is reduced by 7.78 times with accuracy 98% on average."
MudGet: Reproduction of the desired lighting environment using a smart-LED,2017,['Smart LEDs Lighting environment design Color extraction'],,"With the emergence of smart LEDs, lighting based interior design is becoming popular. However, most of the smart LED-based lighting systems rely on expert-human intervention to create a desired atmosphere.For convenience, commercial lighting systems offer a number of options but their usability is fairly restricted. Therefore, an intuitive interface is required for novice users to generate the desired lighting environment. In this paper, we have developed a software, named MudGet, which automatically extracts the light mood from a digital image and controls the LED lamps to reproduce a desired lighting effect according to the extracted light mood. In our method, the light mood is regarded as a set of the representative colors of the digital image. The representative colors are extracted by utilizing K-means clustering algorithm. The dimming parameters are set for which each of the LED lamps create the lighting environment with the mood extracted by the software. To evaluate the feasibility of mood reproduction qualitatively, the degree of similarity between the light mood in the digital image and the reproduced result using LEDs is evaluated by a user study under a miniaturized experimental set. We observe that users can easily produce a desired atmosphere through the proposed MudGet software."
Fine-Grained Mobile Application Clustering Model Using Retrofitted Document Embedding,2017,"['Document embedding', 'Text clustering', 'Deep learning']",,"In this paper, we propose a fine-grained mobile application clustering model using retrofitted document embedding. To automatically determine the clusters and their numbers with no predefined categories, the proposed model initializes the clusters based on title keywords and then merges similar clusters. For improved clustering performance, the proposed model distinguishes between an accurate clustering step with titles and an expansive clustering step with descriptions. During the accurate clustering step, an automatically tagged set is constructed as a result. This set is utilized to learn a high-performance document vector. During the expansive clustering step, more applications are then classified using this document vector. Experimental results showed that the purity of the proposed model increased by 0.19, and the entropy decreased by 1.18, compared with the K-means algorithm. In addition, the mean average precision improved by more than 0.09 in a comparison with a support vector machine classifier."

The developed method matches 2-year production histories and then estimates 3-year performances followed at shale gas reservoirs. The training performance improves the mean absolute error of daily gas rates from 29.2% to 4.3% while the optimum solutions, obtained by k-medoids clustering, show about 1.2% error of daily gas rates and 0.7% error of total production. The sensitivity analysis made by the optimal solutions reveals that the matrix porosity and its permeability influence the shale-gas production.

Japanese academia refers to these screens as ""folding screens presented to the Joseon court as a gift"" (贈朝鮮王室屛風) or zōchō byōbu (贈朝屛風) for short. The Joseon court received 20 pairs of folding screens upon each mission from the fourth through the eleventh, eventually totaling more than 200 works. However, only three works in the National Palace Museum of Korea have been identified as this particular type of folding screen–a pair of Folding Screen with Image of Wild Geese and Lotus (芙蓉雁圖屛風) and one Folding Screen of with Image of Peonies (牡丹圖屛風). This paper determines that the Japanese folding screens in the National Museum of Korea collection– Tadanobu (忠信) and Warriormonks at Yoshino (吉野) and Kasuga Festival (春日祭) (Duk 2152), and Chinzei Hachirō (鎮西八郎) (Duk 2119)–are in fact among those presented to Joseon court by the Tokugawa shogunate.Tadanobu and Warriormonks at Yoshino and Kasuga Festival folding screens and the Chinzei Hachirō folding screen became part of the National Museum of Korea collection early on in 1909 through the means of transfer and acquisition, respectively. Tadanobu and Kasuga were transferred from the Supplies Department (用度課), which was an organ likely affiliated with the Imperial Museum of the Korean Empire, the first modern museum in Korea.Tadanobu and Warriormonks at Yoshino and Kasuga Festival folding screens were gifted to Gapsin sahaeng, meaning the eleventh diplomatic mission dispatched in 1764. Tadanobu and Warriormonks at Yoshino folding screen painted by Kanō Tanrin (狩野探林, 1732–1777) depicts an episode from the life of the loyal subject Satō Tadanobu (佐藤忠信) as he risked his life to save his lord, Minamoto no Yoshitsune (源義經, 1159–1189), from a group of monk-soldiers at Yoshino (吉野). As emphasized in this screen, the theme of loyalty corresponded to a remark made by Arai Hakuseki (新井白石, 1657–1725) to the eighth diplomatic mission in 1711: ""painting is the sole means to disprove that Japanese merely pursue a policy of militarism."" In other words, the Tokugawa shogunate sought to convey particular intentions to Joseon by carefully choosing the motifs of the folding screens.Painted by Kanō Dōju (狩野洞壽, ?–1777), the Kasuga Festival folding screen portrays a parade (お渡り式, owatari shiki) during the festival of the Kasuga Ōmiya and Wakamiya Shrine (春日大宮若宮御祭禮, Kasuga Ōmiya Wakamiya gosairei) held at Kasuga Shrine and Kōfukuji (興福寺), a historic temple in Nara (奈良). During the owatari shiki parade, the arts of dengaku (田樂, ritual music and dancing performance) and isaseuma (將馬, pulling a horse offered by feudal noble family), both of which are dedicated to gods, are performed. Moreover, keiba (競馬, horse racing) and nodachi (野太刀, carrying a large sword) events intended to show off the bravery of warriors were included in the parade. Although the Joseon populace did not know about such traditional Japanese arts, the Tokugawa shogunate seems to have been attempting to boast of their deep-rooted ritual traditions and advanced level of culture through the Kasuga Festival folding screen.Tadanobu and Warriormonks at Yoshino and Kasuga Festival folding screens presented to the eleventh diplomatic mission in 1764 and the Folding Screen of with Image of Peonies owned by the National Palace Museum of Korea all bear a signature mark that contains the Chinese character ""圖 (drawing)"" and the pen name of the artist, as well as the artist’s name seal. Such features only appear in the folding screens given to the eleventh diplomatic mission in 1764, and these three screens carry signatures written in this manner reserved for the Tokugawa shogunate. Thus, it can be observed that the Tokugawa shogunate meticulously oversaw how to write the artist’s signature, how to place the backing paper, and even how to mount these paintings.Kanō Ryūsetsu (狩野柳雪, 1647–1712) painted the Chinzei Hachirō folding screen that the Tokugawa shogunate gifted to the Joseon court during Sinmyo gihaeng, the eighth diplomatic mission in 1711. This screen portrays an old fable in which Minamoto no Tametomo (源為朝, 1139–1170?), an uncle of Kamakura shogunate founder Minamoto no Yoritomo (源頼朝, 1147–1199), subjugated the Kyushu area to which he had been exiled and earned the nickname ""Chinzei Hachirō (鎮西八郎, The Firstborn of the God of War in Kyushu)."" The Chinzei Hachirō screen includes an explanatory note recounting the theme of the painting. Arai Hakuseki ordered the addition of this note in order to allow Joseon people to understand the story. Such an addition was made exclusively in the case of the eighth mission in 1711. The original explanatory note for the Chinzei Hachirō screen is now lost, and only a slight vestige of the note remains. Nonetheless, the Chinzei Hachirō screen is significant as the sole extant example demonstrating an attempt by the Tokugawa shogunate to assist Joseon viewers in understanding its motif.Japanese folding screens presented to the Joseon court provided a medium for transmitting the cultural and political policies of the Tokugawa shogunate to Joseon. By carefully choosing the motifs for the screens, the Tokugawa shogunate intended to demonstrate that, like Joseon, Japan could fully appreciate Confucian values and enjoyed a long history and sophisticated indigenous culture. The rediscovery of Tadanobu and Warriormonks at Yoshino, Kasuga Festival, and Chinzei Hachirō folding screens as gifts to the Joseon court will provide a new perspective for the study of the Joseon Tongsinsa, which has previously been focused on its political and social aspects."

Methods: Our study adapted the stimulation-facilitation model and technology applications as the aphasia intervention model, and adapted the auditory word recognition training and naming as intervention for each language form. Training words were chosen from a list of words in basic and intermediate level of Korean, proposed by the National Institute of Korean Language. Speech recognition function was implemented by using Google’s web speech API in order to compose appropriate contents for the participant. The research design was a multiple baseline design across settings. A 76-year-old woman with chronic Wernicke’s aphasia participated in this study for six days a week for four weeks, with each session lasting more the one hour. Results: The results of the usability test showed that the WSRITP was convenient and easy enough for Wernicke’s aphasic patients to use. Significant improvement had been achieved in the section of naming and that of answering questions which was not referred to in training, which was viewed as results between a pre-test and a post-test. In a post-experiment test of picture-explanation, the participant not only produced all of the words that she had been trained to, but she also produced sentences that were never mentioned before in the training program. In the K-WAB, her ability in the tests of naming objects, auditory word recognition, sequential commands, and yes/no questions was greatly improved. Conclusions: It is certain that the WSRITP is an effective means to help patients with Wernicke aphasia improve their ability of auditory comprehension."

This paper aims to illumine the lived experience of the new through methods of hermeneutics in Goettingen school, and for this it intends to analyse the concept of phenomenological-hermeneutic description. First, this paper analyses Georg Misch’ concept of evoking speech. Evoking speech reveals the transcendent world by means of awakening the being beyond the world. It unveils religious experience, e.i. the inestimable significance of life. Misch intends to extend traditional logic to hermeneutic logic, and as a result of that he can conceptualize the infinite. Second, this paper analyses Josef König’s concept of aesthetic effect, that connects human with artwork and reveals this as a fact. The predicate of aesthetic effect is not the determined predicate, but the modifying. It occurs a significance of being in inwardness with the help of the modifying predicate. The aesthetic effect is similar with religious experience in regard that it makes the new in inwardness. The origin of new significance is the effect that makes human as a new being. Third, this paper analyses Bollnow’s concept of articulating description. It can reveal the religious experience through hitting the spiritual life aptly. The hitting speech evokes concealed being. The hermeneutics of Goettingen school presents ways to the inscrutability and inexhaustibility of life."

In Korea, many ventilation systems with small jet fans are installed in underground parking lots nowadays. In the case of the jet fan ventilation system, research is currently being conducted on the actual arrangement of jet fans and the number of jet fans required to be installed. It is also necessary to conduct research on how to enhance the performance of the small jet fans. Grasping the airflow characteristics of each jet fan is required for understanding its ventilation area. This can be utilized as basic data which may determine the arrangement of jet fans as well as the number of jet fans to be installed in an underground parking lot. In existing studies, research has been conducted by utilizing the jet theory. This study, however, experiments on and comparatively analyzes the various characteristics of jet streams which are generated as a result of the installation of jet fans through the CFD analysis based on the expectation that there may be differences in such spaces as real underground parking lots. This study is mainly focused on deducing a modeling technique and an analysis equation, both of which are close to reality while simplifying the models during the CFD analysis of the proposed alternatives by means of 3D printing. In accordance to the basic case model and CFD simulation benchmark test results, the k-epsilon Realizable model was discovered to be the most similar to reality.

As in other countries, forests, green areas, agricultural lands are rapidly changing into residential or industrial areas in South Korea. Monitoring such rapid changes in land use requires rapid data acquisition, and satellite imagery can be an effective method to this demand. In general, SAR(Synthetic Aperture Radar) satellites acquire images with an active system, so the brightness of the image is determined by the surface roughness. Therefore, the water areas appears dark due to low reflection intensity, In the residential area where the artificial structures are distributed, the brightness value is higher than other areas due to the strong reflection intensity. If we use these characteristics of SAR images, settlement areas can be extracted efficiently. In this study, extraction of settlement areas was performed using TerraSAR-X of German high-resolution X-band SAR satellite and KOMPSAT-5 of South Korea, and object-oriented image classification method using the image segmentation technique is applied for extraction. In addition, to improve the accuracy of image segmentation, the speckle divergence was first calculated to adjust the reflection intensity of settlement areas. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the two satellite images, settlement areas are classified by applying a pixel-based K-means image classification method. As a result, in the case of TerraSAR-X, the accuracy of the object-oriented image classification technique was 88.5%, that of the pixel-based image classification was 75.9%, and that of KOMPSAT-5 was 87.3% and 74.4%, respectively."

ABCD rainfall-runoff model was used to predict monthly dam inflow. Monthly meteorological data collected from KMA, MOLIT and K-water and dam inflow data collected from K-water were used for the model calibration and verification. To estimate the performance of ABCD model, ESP and BAYES-ESP method, time series analysis and skill score (SS) during 1986~2015 were used. In time series analysis monthly ESP dam inflow prediction values were nearly similar for every years, particularly less accurate in wet and dry years. The proposed BAYES-ESP improved the performance of ESP, especially in wet year. The SS was used for quantitative analysis of monthly mean of observed dam inflows, predicted values from ESP and BAYES-ESP. The results indicated that the SS values of ESP were relatively high in January, February and March but negative values in the other months. It also showed that the BAYES-ESP improved ESP when the values from ESP and observation have a relatively apparent linear relationship. We concluded that the existing ESP method has a limitation to predict dam inflow in Korea due to the seasonality of precipitation pattern and the proposed BAYES-ESP is meaningful for improving dam inflow prediction accuracy of ESP."

After the relocation of the capital to Heian, following the order of the honke leader to publish Shinsen shōjiroku, a descendant of Kichita no muraji Jishu, Kichita no muraji Suemoto, who worked in the Sakyō, led other officers to submit the Shinsen shōjiroku, which was then proofread at the publishing office in order to be published in Shinsen shōjiroku of the Sakyō kobetsu. This meant that the shutsuji of the Kichita no muraji descent group, who were officials of overseas origin, was changed to the kobetsu descent group, who were of the Wani descent group origin. The change of the shutsuji was done in such a way that the Kichita no muraji descent group joined the Wani descent group, who were in a consanguineous family relationship as sworn brothers using the fact that they were in a close relationship both in residence and in the workplace. In addition, this change was made through the so-called genealogy incorporation of the progenitor, by adding Hikokunibuku no mikoto, the fourth-generation grandson of Amaterasu Hikokuniosihito no mikoto, to Shiotaritsu, who was the original progenitor of the descent group of Kichita no muraji.  And there is no claim that they are of the kobetsu descent group of the Wani descent group in Shoku Nihon kōki, but the progenitor of Fuminushi, who belonged to Ukyō, is described only as a Japanese Shiotaritsu. However, since the honke of the Kichita no muraji descent group was certified as a kobetsu descent group with the publication of ""Sakyo kobetsu"" in Shinsen shōjiroku, the records afterward followed suit that Shiotaritsu, the grandson of Hikokunibuku no mikoto, was Japanese and the migration to Japan of his eighth-generation grandson, Kichidaijo, was described as him returning to Japan due to homesickness. However, it is written in ""Fuminushi sotsuden,"" in Nihon Montoku Tennō jitsuroku, that the ancestors of Fuminushi, who had the honke of Kichita no muraji, were from Baekje. This means that even though they were described as kobetsu in Shinsen shōjiroku, which is a genealogy record, or as having a Japanese progenitor in Shoku Nihon kōki, the compilers of Nihon Montoku Tennō jitsuroku in the late ninth century, during the Heian Period, stated that it was reasonable to judge that the descendants of the Kichita no muraji descent group were of overseas origin from Baekje.   In addition, a comparison between the case where the shisei title written in the extant Shinsen shōjiroku and in Itsubun is consistent with the given kabane from the Kōnin period, and the case where the shisei title described in the extant Shinsen shōjiroku is inconsistent with the given kabane, verified that the discordance of the shisei title and the given kabane recorded in the extant Shinsen shōjiroku was created when the record of the given sukune in the second year of Kōnin""s rule, which discussed the name change for clans, in other words for the people who belonged to Ukyo, was copied as it was during the making of a draft of Shinsen shōjiroku."

However, rather than one voice, overlapping and unidentifiable voices are heard from the records of the “life of the expelled”(Giorgio Agamben). This brings up more complex questions in addition to the question, “Can the Subaltern Speak?”(Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak): Whose voice is it? Where is the voice positioned? To whom is the voice spoken? Where will they go?  Our task is to read between the lines of these vague voices by reading various types of texts together. Contrasting images such as light/darkness and wandering/paradise appear repeatedly in the autobiographical narratives of hansen’s disease patients, and their meanings are multi-layed. Bright light and New light simultaneously represent a wandering life and the paradise of the future(Soon Sim, Ha-Woon Han), while the pink spots on the bodies of Hansen’s disease patients symbolize the stigmas of despair and curse(Ji-Young Yoon).  Furthermore, the paths of wandering and migration that appear in the testimonies and real life stories of Hansen’s disease patients will be comprehended within historical and cultural contexts(Jeon-Hwang Sim, Baek Kim). The Hybridity(Homi K. Bhabha) of narratives with unclear boundaries between fact and fiction and between history and culture can be interpreted not only as a sign of the tragic life and history of Hansen’s disease patients, but also as a resisting strategy against the discriminatory view of society.  In contrast, in the novel Your Paradise by Yi Cheong-jun, which accepts and transforms various motifs in an autobiographical narratives of Hansen’s disease patients, the pink land Sorokdo is a place where the possibility of paradise and community is asked for again. In particular, the impulse of Mimesis(Walter Benjamin) exhibited by the characters in the island in this novel is read as a practical action that differently speaks and writes the memories of stigma.  To understand the reality of Hansen’s disease patients, we must listen to words at a place where various breaths and voices are crossed. I hope that the memories and traces of stigmas that have not been recorded in official history and have not been extinguished yet will be revealed. I believe that the “Literary History of Stigma” can become a foundation for comparing research about Hansen’s disease patients’ memories of camps in East Asia and research of colonial modernity."

While primary task of this study is to understand and interpret compassion meditation shown at Xuánzàng version of Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra(瑜伽師地論) or Discourse on the Stages of Yogic Practice, another one is to identify disciplinal nature of compassion meditation along with its differences with loving-kindness meditation as emphasized in Asia’s southern schools. The study had following findings.First, ‘loving-kindness meditation’ emphasized mettā-bhāvanā (cultivation of loving-kindness) in an effort to give happiness to people, whereas ’compassion meditation’ emphasized karuṇā-bhāvanā (cultivation of compassion) from the more positive context of rescuing people by rooting out their sufferings, which marked a big difference between these two.Second, this karuṇā-bhāvanā is a rare discipline method in the early Buddhism or in Asia’s southern schools, and such positive interpretation of rooting out sufferings and disasters derived from Abhidharmajñānaprasthāna- śāstra(阿毘達磨發智論) and later established itself as the core ideas of Yogācārabhūmiśāstra and Mahayana Buddhism after going through the great compassion ideology of Abhidharmamahāvibhāsā- śāstra(阿毘達磨大毘婆沙論).Third, while loving-kindness meditation in Asia’s southern schools belonged to the third line of form (Rūpaloka, 色界) in terms of discipline, compassion meditation was described to include not only form, also desire (Kāmaloka, 欲界) and formless (Arūpaloka, 無色界) realm, belonging to VipassanaFourth, according to Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra, how to define and clarify compassion meditation as Vipassana observing six different objects of meaning, thing, symptom (lakṣaṇa), dignity (paksa), time and reason, is the unique nature of compassion meditation as shown only at Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra - not to be seen in other literatures.Lastly, Fifth, when comparing ideology shown in the 『Samdhinirmocana-sutra』 and 『Yogācārabhūmi śāstra』 based on the subject of loving-kindness and compassion meditation as a matter of time of establishment, 『Samdhinirmocana-sutra』 was established first, and 『Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra』 was added afterward. While 『Samdhinirmocana-sutra』 is focused on the explanation of the reason for the dharma, 『Yogācārabhūmiśāstra 』 provides detailed description of practical performance and observation on the basis of the doctrine of 『Samdhinirmocana-sutra』."

Recently while the public philosophy is being actively discussed, the discussion is expanding to the research of public concern. The research of publicness is an intellectual to urge transformation of consciousness about the solution to the whole global issues as well as Korean society activity from the perspectives covering religion, state, enterprise, and academies. Especially in East Asia Korea and Japan is leading a research among solidarity of these researches. The Korean religions which had tried to overcome sufferings from imperialism are appropriate aspects for the research of public concern from these points.  To do it, first, I tried to set a categories of publicness research into modern Korean religions. The activity scope of modern Korean religions covers variety of scopes such as politics, economy, culture, art, and civil movement, and it took as core tasks nationalism, anticapitalism, enlightenment movement, community, coexistence of ideology, civil awareness for freedom, social engagement, and harmony of social diversity. From these perspectives, I examined the possibility of publicness research through four aspects such as response to the capitalism, public movement of civil awareness, independence struggle and recovery of the national sovereignty, and new culture movement.  Continuously, I studied how Won-Buddhism realized the history of public concern during it’s first century. Comprehensively, I arranged the ideological aspect of reformed Buddhism in which it define itself concretely as a public religion, and arranged it’s history of delivering people from the aspect of practice. I arranged the former’s meaning and value through the dharma authentication of ‘the seal of blood from bare fingers,’ Park Jung-bin’s compilation of The Reformation Theory of Buddhism in Joseon Dynasty (Chosŏn pulgyo hyŏksin non) and The Principal Book of Buddhism (Pulgyo chŏngjŏn), and arranged the latter’s through movement of the savings union, levee project at Yeongsan, anti-Japan movement, Song Gyu’s declaration of On Founding a State (Kŏn’guk non).  Based on the history, I treated the public characteristics of Won-Buddhism as a religion from the aspects of inheritance of Mahayana spirit and the spirit of engaged Buddhism. I saw the former as the theory of delivering sentient beings and curing the world, and the thought of communicative interfusion, and examined they are connected with the thought of Great Opening and universal ethics respectively. Won-Buddhism shares the context with modern reformed Buddhism in Asia, and it succeeded to the bodhisattvas spirit in Mahayana Buddhism. And it also accepted the thought of the Great Opening which was a spiritual axis in modern Korean religions. Won-Buddhism, as an engaged Buddhism, established as its doctrine the universal values that modern society requires through the realization of communicative interfusion thought.  Lastly, after liberation from Japan, I added a solidarity movement of religions as one aspect of realizing the public concern by Won-Buddhism. After all, I saw Won-Buddhism can secure objectivity as a public religion by reflecting how it could realize in daily life the religious spirit through the world peace movement, establishment of equal order, practice of globalized spiritual movement and global organization of the United Religions that it declared itself."

유방 표준 팬텀을 이용한 유방촬영술 판독용 모니터와 범용 고화질모니터의 화질 비교: 예비연구,2017,"['Mammography Phantoms', 'Imaging Radiologists Radiology Information Systems']","목적: 유방 표준 팬텀 영상을 이용해 유방촬영술 판독용 모니터(mammography dedicated 5 megapixel monitor; 이하 5M 모니터)와 digital imaging and communications in medicine 지원되는 범용 고화질 모니터(UHD 4K monitor; 이하 4K 모니터) 사이의 화질을 비교하여 그 차이를 알아보고 4K 모니터의 임상적용을 위한 연구 가능성을 알아보자 하였다.대상과 방법: 유방 표준 팬텀을 세 가지 다른 노출 조건(자동노출, 노출과다, 노출부족)으로 촬영하여 각각 영상을 얻은 후 이 영상들 내에 포함되어 있는 모조 병소들 즉 섬유, 작은 알갱이 집단, 종괴(fiber, group of specks, mass)를 여섯 명의 영상의학과 의사가 독립적으로 5M 모니터와 4K 모니터에서 영상의 조정 없이 관찰하였고, 두 모니터에서 보이는 각 모조 병소들의 평균 점수를 구하였다. 통계 분석은 SPSS 프로그램(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)을 사용하여 모조 병소들의 평균 값의 비교는 독립표본 t-test (independent sample t-test)를 이용하였고, 관찰자 간 신뢰도는 급내 상관계수(Intraclass correlation coefficient; 이하 ICC)를 이용하여 검정하였다.결과: 전반적인 결과는 5M 모니터에서 섬유 4.25, 작은 알갱이 집단 3.92, 종괴 3.28, 4K 모니터는 섬유 3.81, 작은 알갱이 집단 3.58, 종괴 3.14로, 섬유와 종괴는 두 모니터 간 차이가 통계적으로 유의하지 않았으나, 작은 알갱이 집단은 4K 모니터에서 점수가 조금 낮았다(p = 0.0492). 자동노출과 노출과다의 경우 모조 병소 모두 두 모니터 간 차이는 없었고, 노출부족의 경우 섬유와 종괴는 차이가 없었으나 작은 알갱이 집단은 두 모니터 간 화질 차이가 있었다(p = 0.012). 여섯 명의 관찰자 간 신뢰도 검정결과는 ICC의 상관 계수가 0.874로 나와 매우 신뢰할 수 있는 결과를 보였다.결론: 적절한 조건하에 얻어진 유방 팬텀 영상으로 5M 모니터와 4K 모니터 사이의 화질 차이를 평가했을 때 두 모니터 간 유의한 화질차이는 없어 임상적 연구에 4K 모니터 사용이 가능할 것으로 판단된다. 그러나 이것은 팬텀 영상을 이용한 소규모의 예비 연구로 실제 유방 영상은 화질 평가에 있어서 다를 수 있으므로, 다양한 임상 영상 소견을 대상으로 한 임상 유방 영상 연구가 뒤따라야 한다.","Purpose: Using standard mammographic phantom images, we compared the image quality obtained between a mammography dedicated 5 megapixel monitor (5M) and a UHD 4K (4K) monitor with digital imaging and communications in medicine display, to investigate the possibility of clinical application of 4K monitors.Materials and Methods: Three different exposures (autoexposure, overexposure and underexposure) images of mammographic phantom were obtained, and six radiologists independently evaluated the images in 5M and 4K without image modulation, by scoring of fibers, groups of specks and masses within the phantom image. The mean score of each object on both monitors was independently analyzed, using t-test and interobserver reliability by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of SPSS.Results: The overall mean scores of fiber, group of specks, and mass in 5M were 4.25, 3.92, and 3.28 respectively, and scores obtained in 4K monitor were 3.81, 3.58, and 3.14, respectively. No statistical difference was seen in scores of fiber and mass between the two monitors at all exposure conditions, but the score of group of specks in 4K was statistically lower in the overall (p = 0.0492) and in underexposure conditions (p = 0.012). The ICC for interobserver reliability was excellent (0.874).Conclusion: Our study suggests that since the mammographic phantom images are appropriate with no significant difference in image quality observed between the two monitors, the 4K monitor could be used for clinical studies. Since this is a small preliminary study using phantom images, the result may differ in actual mammographic images, and subsequent investigation with clinical mammographic images is required."

Phenotypic Stability for Selected Traits of Some Cowpea Lines in Nigerian Agro-ecologies,2017,"['Agro-ecology', 'Cowpea', 'Grain size', 'Grain yield', 'Multi-environment', 'Phenotypic stability', 'Photo-thermo sensitive', 'Trials']",,"Eight advanced breeding lines of cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] were evaluated in a multi-environment trial for phenotypic stability of grain yield, maturity and grain size. There was highly significant genotype x environment interaction for all traits. Simple correlation coefficient was computed to ascertain the level of relationship between stability parameters and agronomic traits. Line IT93K-452-1 was identified as most stable genotype and can be grown all over the Nigerian cowpea belt. The line IT90K-503-1 was the most unstable genotype in terms of grain yield and was also nonresponsive to the environment. However, it is environment specific. IT93K-452-1 has relatively stable maturity across environments. The result suggests that IT93K-452-1 will mature around the average of 65 days irrespective of the location in Nigeria. Lines IT95K-1455 and IT90K-503-1, whose stability parameter values were high, means that in respect of maturity, they are photo-thermo sensitive. They can mature early or delayed depending on the photo-thermal environment. However, lines such as IT93K-273-2-1, IT93K-129-4, IT93K-452-1 and IT86D-719 are photo-thermo insensitive. Line IT93K-1543 was identified as the most desirable genotype in terms of grain size. This is followed by IT93K-452-1. The line IT90K-503-1 had small but unstable seed size. This work identified IT93K-452-1 and IT93K-273-2-1 as the most stable genotypes for yield and maturity. Grain yield was highly positively correlated with bi and R<sup>2</sup> but was negatively correlated with Sd<sup>2</sup><sub>i</sub>. Maturity was negatively highly correlated with b<sub>i</sub>, W<sub>i</sub>, and CV<sub>i</sub>. Grain size on the other hand is not correlated with any of the parameters."

The sediments are moderately sorted to poorly sorted, showing ranges of 0.62 ~ 1.45Ø (0.90Ø in mean). They are coarse to fine skewed and meso- to leptokurtic with ranges of 0.62 ~ 1.45Ø (0.90Ø in mean) and 0.93 ~ 1.30 (1.08 in mean), respectively. However, the skewness values of the sediments are irregularly changed. The sediments are classified into the four facies of sandy gravel (sG), gravelly sand (gS), slightly gravelly mud ((g)S) and sand(S), dominated in coarse sediments.Mean contents of major, minor and heavy metallic elements in the sediments are low relative to that in the earth crust. Of above elements in the sediments, Al is highly correlated with Fe, Mg, Ti, P, Mn, Co, Cr, Ni, Sc, V, Cu, Zn, Pb, and Ca correlated with Sr. In addition, K is highly correlated with Mn and Pb. Exceptionally, Zr is lowly or negatively correlated with above all elements.The elements are mainly controlled by two factors having the explanation of 76.04% to total variance. Factor 1 is highly loaded in Al, Fe, Mg, Ti, P, Mn, Co, Cr, Li, Ni, Sc, V, Cu, Zn, Pb and mean grain size. Therefore, it is closely interrelated with clastic sediments. Meanwhile, factor 2 is highly loaded in Ca, Ba, and Sr. It could be explained by rocks distributed around the study area on the bases of the similar ionic radii of Ca, Sr, Ba and their richness in plagioclases.Elements of the sediments show following results; Fe, K, Ba, Li, Zr, Pb are enriched above 1 in EF, and Cr, Ni, Cu are above 1 in geoaccumulation index(Igeo), respectively. High enrichments of Fe, K, Ba, Li, Zr, Pb might be related with acidic rocks around the study area. Although Igeo values of Cr, Ni, Cu are above 1 in the area, it is considered that they are relatively no longer concentrated."

다수의 영상간 효율적인 스티칭을 위한 카메라 센서 정보 기반 영상 그룹핑 기술,2017,"['Panorama', 'Stitching', 'K-mean clustering', 'GPS', 'Azimuth', 'FOV', 'SURF']",,"Since the panoramic image can overcome the limitation of the viewing angle of the camera and have a wide field of view, it has been studied effectively in the fields of computer vision and stereo camera. In order to generate a panoramic image, stitching images taken by a plurality of general cameras instead of using a wide-angle camera, which is distorted, is widely used because it can reduce image distortion. The image stitching technique creates descriptors of feature points extracted from multiple images, compares the similarities of feature points, and links them together into one image. Each feature point has several hundreds of dimensions of information, and data processing time increases as more images are stitched. In particular, when a panorama is generated on the basis of an image photographed by a plurality of unspecified cameras with respect to an object, the extraction processing time of the overlapping feature points for similar images becomes longer. In this paper, we propose a preprocessing process to efficiently process stitching based on an image obtained from a number of unspecified cameras for one object or environment. In this way, the data processing time can be reduced by pre-grouping images based on camera sensor information and reducing the number of images to be stitched at one time. Later, stitching is done hierarchically to create one large panorama. Through the grouping preprocessing proposed in this paper, we confirmed that the stitching time for a large number of images is greatly reduced by experimental results."

Burnett v.Chetwood(1720) 판결과 Gyles v. Wilcox(1740) 판결은 노동을 중시하여, 각각 번역본과 축약본을 새로운 작품으로 볼 수 있다고 판시하였다. 이로써천재의 독창성, 특허법상의 신규성이 아니라, ‘베끼지 않음’을 의미하는 ‘독창성’ 개념이 싹트게 된다. 또한 Tonson v. Collins(1760) 등의 판례를 거치면서 ‘표현의 독창성’이라는 개념이 형성된다. 이같이 18세기 영국 사법부는‘베끼지 않은, 표현에 존재하는’이라는 ‘독창성’ 개념을 만들었고, 이는 지금까지 이어져 오고 있다. 한편, 18세기 문학계에서의 ‘독창적 천재’ 논의와 18 세기 후반 낭만주의 시대 도입에 따른 ‘미적 독창성’ 개념은 영국 법조계에거의 영향을 주지 못했다. 이는 근대적 저작권법의 입법이 늦은 유럽대륙(프랑스, 독일)과 다른 점이다.","Under the U.K. Copyright Act, the origin of the originality concept dates back to the Ann Act(1710). The Act grants rights to authors and others without mentioning originality. The concept of originality developed in the process of interpretation of the concept of ‘author’ in the court until the copyright law explicitly required originality in 1911.Burnett v Chetwood (1720) and Gyles v Wilcox (1740) ruled that labor was important, and that translations and abbreviations could be viewed as new works, respectively. In this way, the concept of ‘originality’, which means ‘not copied’, is born, different from the creativity of genius or novelty in patent law. In addition, through the judgments of the late 18th century, the notion of ‘originality of expression’ is formed. Thus, in the 18th century, the British judiciary created the concept of ‘originality’, which is ‘not copied’ and ‘original in expression.’ The concept of ‘creative genius’ in literature in the 18th century and the concept of ‘aesthetic originality’ in the late 18th century romanticism had little impact on the British legal system. This is different from European continent(France, Germany) which enacted modern copyright Act in the late 18th century or early 19th century."

This proposal is based upon an actual experimentation with drama productions at Asia United Theological University (a.k.a. ACTS). Since 2014, ACTS has hosted a series of theo-drama stage productions (chiefly, movement art-oriented) - which were choreographed and directed by this author - as listed below:“Imago” (2014) biblical overview of salvation history from Genesis to Revelation“Prophetica” (2015) preaching drama portraying the biblical prophetic type lineage“Communio” (2016) theological meaning of communion based on John Calvin’s view“Resurrectio” (2017) essence of the cross/resurrection as depicted by the body of ChristHere, the term “theo-drama,” short for “theological drama,” refers to a way of expression on stage through diverse artistic means, such as dance, mime, acting, design, and media, among others, to depict the biblical theological concepts in a more visual and experiential way. Thus, “theo-drama” may be understood as a sort of theologizing on stage, or simply “theology on stage.”Although the term, “theo-drama,” is used by some theologians (Hans Urs von Balthasar and Kevin J. Vanhoozer, among others) as a way of interpreting the Scripture in terms of dramatic or theatrical paradigm, I am using the term primarily as a practical way of depicting the biblical theological themes and their significances on stage. In other words, while based on these biblical-theological interpretations of “theo-drama,” I extend the implications to the actual productions and performances of such interpretations through creative theatrical means on stage.In this thesis, the concept of theo-drama is essentially scripted and analyzed through the lens of one particular case study of theatrical production called “Resurrectio.” The thesis will be in two parts. First, the theo-drama “Resurrectio” is explained in detail from various aspects of its planning, choreography, production, and performance. Second, the implications in terms of means and principles are drawn from this and other experiences of theo-drama productions, as follows: (1) creative staging; (2) movement art; (3) theological drama; (4) theological education; and (5) cross-cultural mission."

In the habitat types cluster analysis, non-hierarchical cluster analysis (kmeans cluster analysis), hierarchical cluster analysis, and non-metric multidimensional scaling method were applied to 14 habitat types recorded more than 30 times. A total of 7 Orders, 16 Families, and 39 Species of mammals were identified in the 3rd National Ecosystem Survey collected nationwide. When 11 clusters were classified by habitat types, the simple structure index was the highest (ssi = 0.07). As a result of the similarities and hierarchies between habitat types suggested by the hierarchical clustering analysis, the residential areas were the most different habitat types for mammals; the next following type was a cluster together with rivers and coasts. The results of the non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis demonstrated that both Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus restrictively appeared in a residential area, which is the most discriminating habitat type. Lutra lutra restrictively appeared in coastal and river areas. In summary, according to our results, the mammalian habitat can be divided into the following four types: (1) the forest type (using forest as the main habitat and migration route); (2) the river type (using water as the main habitat); (3) the residence habitat (living near residential area); and (4) the lowland type (consuming grain or seeds as the main feeding resource)."

The results showed that the centering phenomenon of the process of academic improvement was “breaking out of the vicious cycle through enlightenment.` In other words, the academic improvement of the university students wasn`t a simply an improvement in their grades, but rather the process of the participants denying the situation and exploring the positive and negative perceptions of themselves and their environment to break out of their past, where they experienced rock bottom and endlessly wandered about, and eventually `breaking out of the vicious cycle through enlightenment and discovering their new selves.` Such ecosystematic approach can be used as a grounded theory to develop various interventions and programs that appropriately help academic improvement, which can be viewed as a result of the interaction between individuals and their environment."

Previous keyword search methods based on distinct root semantics only retrieve a set of answer trees having different root nodes. Thus, they often find answer trees with similar meanings or low query relevance together while those with the same root node cannot be retrieved together even if they have different meanings and high query relevance. We propose a new method to find diverse and relevant answers to the query by permitting duplication of root nodes among them. We present an efficient query processing algorithm using path indexes to find top-k answers given a maximum amount of root duplication a set of answer trees can have. We show by experiments using a real dataset that the proposed approach can produce effective answer trees which are less redundant in their content nodes and more relevant to the query than the previous method."

In this process, we suggest efficient guidances to cope with clinical practice stress. Methods: The questionnaire was administered from November to December in 2016. It targeted students majoring in Speech-Language Pathology in three-year colleges and four-year universities in Daegu, Busan, Gwangju, and Gyeonggi-do. 106 three-year course students and 75 four-year course students participated. The questionnaires were composed of five questions of daily courses by BEPSI-K, 32 questions of clinical practice stress, and 10 questions of coping of clinical practice stress. Results: The study found that the stress encountered by students majoring in Speech-Language Pathology is below average. Of the factors, practice role is highest, followed by, in order, clinical practice, value/ideal, and human relationship. Also, the study revealed that students majoring in Speech-Language Pathology used aggressive coping more often than passive coping to cope with clinical practice stress. Social support is used the highest in aggressive coping. Avoidance coping is used the highest in the passive coping section. Conclusions: According to the study, the higher the stress between practice instructers and peers, the lower degree of social support coping. The higher the stress on human relationships, the higher the degree of emotional coping and hopeful coping. This means that the systematic improvements to the improving and controlling ability of human relationships is needed institutionally. It also implies that to fulfill clinical practice, personality education to learn methods of maintaining easygoing human relationships is desperately demanded. Also, it is considered that the pride-establishment of students majoring in Speech-Language Pathology is needed."

However, the field measurement using tracer gas has disadvantages such as danger, inefficiency, and high cost. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate ventilation rate in pig house by using the thermal distribution data rather than tracer gas. Especially, LMA (Local Mean Age), which is an index based on the age of air theory, was used to evaluate the ventilation rate in pig house. Firstly, the field experiment was conducted to measure micro-climate inside pig house, such as the air temperature, $CO_2$ concentration and wind velocity. And then, LMA was calculated based on the decay of $CO_2$ concentration and air temperature, respectively. This study compared between LMA determined by $CO_2$ concentration and air temperature; the average error and root mean square error were 3.76 s and 5.34 s. From these results, it was determined that thermal distribution data could be used for estimation of LMA. Finally, CFD (Computational fluid dynamic) model was validated using LMA and wind velocity. The mesh size was designed to be 0.1 m based on the grid independence test, and the Standard $k-{\omega}$ model was eventually chosen as the proper turbulence model. The developed CFD model was highly appropriate for evaluating the ventilation rate in pig house."

대기복사전달모델을 이용한 제주지역 도심 및 배경지점에서의 온실가스에 따른 복사강제력 영향 연구,2017,"['Greenhouse gases', 'radiative forcing', 'urban center and background sites', 'Jeju', 'radiative transfer model']",,"The spatial and temporal variations in radiative forcing (RF) and mean temperature changes of greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as CO2, CH4, and N2O, were analyzed at urban center (Yeon-dong) and background sites (Gosan) on Jeju Island during 2010~2015, based on a modeling approach (i.e., radiative transfer model). Overall, the RFs and mean temperature changes of CO2 at Yeon-dong during most years (except for 2014) were estimated to be higher than those at Gosan. This might be possibly because of its higher concentrations at Yeon-dong due to relatively large energy consumption and small photosynthesis and also the difference in radiation flux due to the different input condition (e.g., local time and geographic coordinates of solar zenith angle) in the model. The annual mean RFs and temperature changes of CO2 were highest in 2015 (2.41W m −2 and 1.76 K) at Yeon-dong and in 2013 (2.22W m −2 and 1.62 K) at Gosan (except for 2010 and 2011). The maximum monthly/seasonal mean RFs and temperature changes of CO2 occurred in spring (Mar. and/or Apr.) or winter (Jan. and/or Feb.) at the two sites during the study period, whereas the minimum RFs and temperature changes in summer (Jun.-Aug.). In the case of CH4 and N2O, their impacts on the RF and mean temperature changes were very small (an order of magnitude lower) compared to CO2. The spatio-temporal differences in these RF values of GHGs might primarily depend on the atmospheric profile (e.g., ozone profile), surface albedo, local time (or solar zenith angle), as well as their mass concentrations."

We use the widely-accepted methodology W-NOMINATE, supplemented with a cluster analysis to further overcome the limits of survey, linear, or interfacial analyses that appear in the related studies.The result indicate that the 19th parliamentary political cleavages were at least five dimensional, and confirm a clear-cut cleavage between the progressives and conservatives. The area between the two parties is composed of minority parties, established in the 19th and 20th Congress, where they form a hierarchical structure within the political sector of the major parties. Meanwhile, the ruling conservative party showed a high level of political intensity with an unique cluster, but most of all progressive parties included more than two distinct clusters of political disposition. Thus, the study found that the political cleavages were one of the major factors impeding the party politics by incentivizing party-to-party political transactions rather than responses to civil society in policy."

In order to maintain the area same the limbs sizes are slightly increased accordingly. Numerical analysis has been carried out to generate similar nature of flow condition as per IS: 875 (Part -III):1987 (a mean wind velocity of 10 m/s) by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with help of ANSYS CFX ($k-{\varepsilon}$ model). The variation of mean pressure coefficients, pressure distribution over the surface, flow pattern and force coefficient are evaluated for each cases and represented graphically to understand extent of nonconformities due to such angular modifications in plan. Finally regular cross shaped building results are compared with wind tunnel results obtained from similar '+' shaped building study with similar flow condition. Reduction in along wind force coefficients for angular crossed shaped building, observed for various skew angles leads to develop lesser along wind force on building compared to regular crossed shaped building and square plan shaped building. Interference effect within the internal faces are observed in particular faces of building for both cases, considerably. Significant deviation is noticed in wind induced responses for angular cross building compared to regular cross shaped building for different direction wind flow."

This particular poetic work was created when the author was appointed as the magistrate of the district of Mokchǒn, relatively a marginal position in the country, and the poems became an important source to understand the author’s consciousness and emotional experience reflected in the lyrics.  Hwang Yunsǒk employed the extended form of sijo, called yǒn－sijo, which enabled him to convey the details of his feelings. However, he detach himself from the convention of ordinary sijo and created a unique form and the content, in which he deals with his loyal attitude toward the ruler on the one hand and expresses his affection for his family on the other. His poems also illuminate his selfhood in reality. In general, Hwang’s poems are characterized by two major subjects: the embodiment of the Confucian ideology and the author’s own individual aspect of life. In other words, Hwang’s poems can be divided between the autobiographic writing and the expression of the Confucian ideology. Particularly, he portrayed the reality of his life as a local official in the autobiographic writing, which captures his private feelings and the condition of life. On the other hand, the poems show that the internalization of the Confucian norms and ideology propelled him to focus on study and self-cultivation.  In this context, “Mokchu chapka” has interwoven various elements of Hwang’s consciousness of reality and his feelings. In conclusion, “Mokchu chapka” reflects the literati’s consciousness of an elite man in the local area during the 18th Century and also shows the interiority of the poet. While he served as the magistrate of Mokch’ǒn, he struggled to overcome his frustration with the reality and his poem－writing likewise provided him with a way to overcome his frustration through the realization of the Neo－Confucian ideology in the literary world."

Demographic data were collected, and clinical symptoms, cognitive function, and social function were evaluated to verify SCoRS-K’s reliability and validity. Clinical symptoms were evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the Clinical Global Impression-Schizophrenia Scale. Cognitive function was evaluated using a short form of the Korean Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Social function was evaluated using the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale, the Schizophrenia Quality of Life Scale, and the Social Functioning Scale.Results: Data analysis demonstrated SCoRS-K’s statistically significant reliability and validity. SCoRS-K has high internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha; patient 0.941, informant 0.905, interviewer 0.964); test-retest reliability [patient 0.428 (p=0.003), informant 0.502 (p<0.001), interviewer 0.602 (p<0.001); and global rating 0.642 (p<0.001)]. The mean scores of subjects were significantly higher than those of the controls (p<0.001), demonstrating SCoRS-K’s discriminant validity. Significant correlations between the total scores and global rating score of SCoRS-K and those of the scales and tests listed above (except WCST) support SCoRS-K’s concurrent validity.Conclusion: SCoRS-K is a useful instrument for evaluating the degree of cognitive dysfunction in Korean schizophrenia patients."

The strategy using the knowledge of Chinese characters for understanding the S-K words is available for only 32% of them, so we can not adopt that strategy on vocabulary education in general. Furthermore, the knowledge of Chinese characters needed on S-K words education is not the knowledge of the character’s shape but the hun, the meaning part, so there is little theoretical basis to expose Chinese characters or to make students memorize them."

Study subjects were 18 Target patterns designed for 2 children groups, 4 adolescent and 4 adult male and female groups in Dietary Reference Intakes for Koreans 2015. Nutrients examined were 4 macro-nutrients(protein, fat, carbohydrate, and dietary fiber), 5 minerals(Ca, P, Fe, Na, and K), and 5 vitamins(vitamin A, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and vitamin C). Energy and nutrients contents were calculated based upon assigned multiples of single serving in Target pattern and Representative Food Composition Table by Excel program. Among the 18 Target patterns, only 5 were mean adequacy ratio(MAR) of 1.0, fulfilled the expectations of Dietary Guidance System. Protein and Na contents were more than dietary reference intakes(DRI) in all 18 Target patterns. Dietary fiber, Ca, and K were deficient nutrient in 15, 10, and 9 Target patterns, respectively. The units of vitamin A were not same in Target pattern and DRI, retinol equivalent(RE) in Target pattern and retinol activity equivalent(RAE) in DRI. When calculate RE content of vitamin A in Target pattern to RAE content, 15 Target patterns did not reach to DRI of vitamin A. The Target pattern of elderly women showed the lowest mean adequacy ratio(MAR), 7 nutrients were less than DRI, need to be revised. Average energy contribution ratio of protein, fat, and carbohydrate were 16.04%, 24.35%, and 60.91%, respectively, fulfilled the adequate acceptable macro-nutrient distribution range(AMDR). To improve the nutritional inadequacy of dietary fiber, Ca, K, and vitamin A in Target pattern, effective mean may be the increasing vegetable group assignment. Also decreasing the meat･fish･egg･legume group assignment in some Target pattern may be the way of preventing of protein overconsumption. The energy in adequate amount for condiment use also need to be considered."
A path-dependent fatigue crack propagation model under non-proportional modes I and III loading conditions,2017,"['Mixed mode crack growth', 'Multi-axial fatigue', 'Non-proportional loading', 'Moment of load path', 'Effective stress intensity factor', 'K plane', 'Path-dependent fatigue damage', 'Path-dependent cycle counting']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>It has been well established that fatigue damage process is load-path dependent under non-proportional multi-axial loading conditions. Most of studies to date have been focusing on interpretation of S-N based test data by constructing a path-dependent fatigue damage model. This paper presents a two-parameter mixed-mode fatigue crack growth model which takes into account of crack growth dependency on both load path traversed and a maximum effective stress intensity attained in a stress intensity factor plane (  e . g . ,  <SUB>  K   I  </SUB> - <SUB>  K   III  </SUB>   plane). By taking advantage of a path-dependent maximum range (PDMR) cycle definition (Dong et al., 2010; Wei and Dong, 2010), the two parameters are formulated by introducing a moment of load path (MLP) based equivalent stress intensity factor range (  Δ <SUB>  K   NP  </SUB>  ) and a maximum effective stress intensity parameter   <SUB>  K   Max  </SUB>   incorporating an interaction term   <SUB>  K   I  </SUB> · <SUB>  K   III  </SUB>  . To examine the effectiveness of the proposed model, two sets of crack growth rate test data are considered. The first set is obtained as a part of this study using 304 stainless steel disk specimens subjected to three combined non-proportional modes I and III loading conditions (i.e., with a phase angle of 0°, 90°, and 180°). The second set was obtained by Feng et al. (2007) using 1070 steel disk specimens subjected to similar types of non-proportional mixed-mode conditions. Once the proposed two-parameter non-proportional mixed-mode crack growth model is used, it is shown that a good correlation can be achieved for both sets of the crack growth rate test data.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  Presented a two-parameter mixed-mode fatigue crack growth model. </LI> <LI>  Both load path dependency and mean stress effect are considered. </LI> <LI>  Validated by non-proportional mixed mode I and III crack growth tests on 304 steel. </LI> <LI>  Good correlations are achieved both for test data obtained in this study and from others. </LI> </UL> </P>"
Second Chern numbers of vector bundles and higher adeles,2017,"['vector bundles', 'Chern numbers', 'higher adeles', 'algebraic and arithmetic surfaces']",,We give a construction of the second Chern number of a vector bundle over a smooth projective surface by means of adelic transition matrices for the vector bundle. The construction does not use an algebraic $K$-theory and depends on the canonical $\Z$-torsor of a locally linearly compact $k$-vector space. Analogs of certain auxiliary results for the case of an arithmetic surface are also discussed.

In particular, I will focus on the Structure of Operations and the System for Business.  People’s liberation army of China played a key role in recovering and reestablishing North Korea. The North announced a new policy to rebuild and reestablish propaganda systems focusing on propaganda offices as top priority.  There are some important differences. When it came to operational structure, North Korea introduced paid-propaganda officers and sent them to the rural areas, which meant that North Korea consolidated and centrally managed all propaganda officers. When it came to working system, party memberships were required to become any member of propaganda offices. In addition to that, each provincial party committee and people’s committee were forced to be responsible to educate and select directors of propaganda offices.  Through these efforts, North Korea enabled local citizens to support the Kim Il-sung regime and to unite and fight for North Korea and Kim Il-sung."
SPACE TELESCOPE AND OPTICAL REVERBERATION MAPPING PROJECT.VI. REVERBERATING DISK MODELS FOR NGC 5548,2017,,,"<P>We conduct a multiwavelength continuum variability study of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 5548 to investigate the temperature structure of its accretion disk. The 19 overlapping continuum light curves (1158 angstrom to 9157 angstrom) combine simultaneous Hubble Space Telescope, Swift, and ground-based observations over a 180 day period from 2014 January to July. Light-curve variability is interpreted as the reverberation response of the accretion disk to irradiation by a central time-varying point source. Our model yields the disk inclination i = 36 degrees +/- 10 degrees, temperature T-1= (44 +/- 6) x 10(3) K at 1 light day from the black hole, and a temperature-radius slope (T proportional to r(-alpha)) of alpha = 0.99 +/- 0.03. We also infer the driving light curve and find that it correlates poorly with both the hard and soft X-ray light curves, suggesting that the X-rays alone may not drive the ultraviolet and optical variability over the observing period. We also decompose the light curves into bright, faint, and mean accretion-disk spectra. These spectra lie below that expected for a standard blackbody accretion disk accreting at L/L-Edd = 0.1.</P>"
The Effects of Altered Membrane Cholesterol Levels on Sodium Pump Activity in Subclinical Hypothyroidism,2017,"['Hypothyroidism', 'Sodium-potassium-exchanging ATPase', 'Membrane lipids']",,"Background: Metabolic dysfunctions characteristic of overt hypothyroidism (OH) start at the early stage of subclinical hypothyroidism(SCH). Na+/K+-ATPase (the sodium pump) is a transmembrane enzyme that plays a vital role in cellular activities in combinationwith membrane lipids. We evaluated the effects of early changes in thyroid hormone and membrane cholesterol on sodiumpump activity in SCH and OH patients.Methods: In 32 SCH patients, 35 OH patients, and 34 euthyroid patients, sodium pump activity and cholesterol levels in red bloodcell membranes were measured. Serum thyroxine (T4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were measured using enzymelinkedimmunosorbent assays. Differences in their mean values were analysed using post hoc analysis of variance. We assessed thedependence of the sodium pump on other metabolites by multiple regression analysis.Results: Sodium pump activity and membrane cholesterol were lower in both hypothyroid groups than in control group, OH groupexhibiting lower values than SCH group. In SCH group, sodium pump activity showed a significant direct dependence on membranecholesterol with an inverse relationship with serum TSH levels. In OH group, sodium pump activity depended directly on membranecholesterol and serum T4 levels. No dependence on serum cholesterol was observed in either case.Conclusion: Despite the presence of elevated serum cholesterol in hypothyroidism, membrane cholesterol contributed significantlyto maintain sodium pump activity in the cells. A critical reduction in membrane cholesterol levels heralds compromised enzyme activity,even in the early stage of hypothyroidism, and this can be predicted by elevated TSH levels alone, without any evident clinicalmanifestations."

Inorganic nitrogen dynamics of throughfall following fertilization in a red pine stand,2017,"['Fertilization', 'nutrient', 'nutrient cycle', 'nitrogen ﬂux', 'nutrient concentration', 'rainfall']",,"Inorganic nitrogen ﬂuxes caused by rainfall and throughfall following fertilizer applications were measured in a red pine stand located in the Wola National Experimental Forest in Jinju, Korea. Fertilizer (N3P4K1 = 113:150:37 kg ha¡1 yr¡1) was applied for 2 years, and inorganic nitrogen ﬂuxes were monitored from April 2011 to March 2013. Monthly variations in inorganic nitrogen concentrations were generally higher in the throughfall than in the rainfall, whereas monthly variations in concentrations were similar between the fertilized and control treatments. The mean NH4+ and NO3¡ concentrations during the study period were 0.39 and 0.21 mg L¡1 for the rainfall, 1.06 and 1.06 mg L¡1 for the control, and 1.01 and 0.89 mg L¡1 for the fertilizer treatments, respectively. Inorganic nitrogen ﬂuxes were generally higher during the growing season (May– October) than during the dormant season (November–April). Inorganic nitrogen ﬂuxes were higher in the throughfall (17.03 kg ha¡1 yr¡1 in the control treatments and 14.93 kg ha¡1 yr¡1 in the fertilizer treatments) than in the rainfall (10.66 kg ha¡1 yr¡1). This result indicates that inorganic nitrogen concentrations and ﬂuxes of throughfall are affected by the amount of throughfall rather than by fertilizer application in a red pine stand."

Effects of surface roughness on evolutions of loss and deviation in a linear compressor cascade,2017,"['Compressor cascade', 'Deviation evolution', 'Loss evolution', 'Surface roughness']",,"Experiments have been conducted to investigate surface roughness effects on the evolutions of loss and deviation downstream of a compressor blade row. Two cases - smooth (k + = 1.27) and rough (k + = 38.92) - have been investigated. Roughness has been attached to the blade suction side using a spray type glue gun and emery grain. At x/c = 0.2, 0.3 and 0.5 (downstream of the cascade), a five-hole probe has been used to measure the total pressure, mean velocity, and deviation at the mid-span. Static pressure taps on the blades have been used to measure the blade loading. When roughness is increased, the loss is larger and the loss increases more rapidly in the axial direction, indicating enhanced mixing. The deviation also increases at every measurement plane when roughness is increased. In addition, pitch-wise deviation distribution becomes uniform at x/c = 0.5 due to enhanced mixing."

Empirical Orthogonal Function(EOF) 분석 결과, 첫 번째 모드의 클로로필-a 농도 변화는 엔소(El Nin˜o/Southern Oscillation, ENSO)의 변화와 높은 관계를 보이고, 두 번째 모드의 클로로필-a 농도 변화는 엔소에 의한 영향보다는 인도양 쌍극진동의 변화와 상대적으로 높은 관계를 나타냈다. 클로로필-a 농도는 두 개의 모드에서 공통적으로 동 인도양과 서 인도양에서 서로 상반된 변화를 나타냈다. 클로로필-a 농도 변화는 동 인도양, 서 인도양및 인도 주변 해역에서는 인도양 쌍극진동과 밀접한 관계를 보이고, 열대 중앙 인도양 중에서는 상대적으로엔소의 변화와 높은 관계를 나타냈다.그러나 클로로필-a 농도의 시/공간적 변화는 인도양 쌍극진동의 발생 기작에 따라 다른 반응을 나타냈다.클로로필-a 농도 변화는 첫 번째 타입 인도양 쌍극진동(엔소 발생시기와 동일)은 여름철에 동 인도양과 서인도양에서 클로로필-a 농도 차이가 생기고, 최대는 가을에 발생했다. 두 번째 타입 인도양 쌍극진동(엔소발생 후 그 다음 해 또는 소멸되는 시기)은 봄에 동 인도양과 서 인도양 클로로필-a 농도 차이가 생기고, 여름과 가을에 증가되어, 겨울에 감소되었다. 인도양 쌍극진동의 변동에 따른 클로로필-a 농도 변화는 동 인도양과 서 인도양의 클로로필-a 농도 차이를 발생시키는 과정은 유사하지만, 북부 인도양은 쌍극진동 발생기작에 따라 상반된 클로로필-a 농도 변화를 나타냈다.","To understand the temporal and spatial variations of surface chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) distribution in the Indian Ocean (30°E~120°E, 30°S~30°N) by the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), we conducted EOF and K means analyses of monthly satellite-derived Chl-a data in the region during 1998~2016 periods.Chl-a showed low values in the central region of the Indian Ocean and relatively high values in the upwelling region and around the marginal regions of the Indian Ocean. It also had a strong seasonal variation of Chl-a, showing the lowest value in the spring and the highest value in summer due to the change of the monsoon and current system. The EOF analysis showed that Chl-a variation in EOF mode 1 is related to ENSO (El Niño/Southern Oscillation) and that of mode 2 is linked to IOD. Both modes explained spatially opposite trends of Chl-a in the east and west Indian Ocean. From K means analysis, the Chl-a variation in the east and west Indian Ocean, and around India have relatively good relationship with IOD while that in the tropical and middle Indian Ocean closely associated with ENSO.The spatial and temporal distribution of Chl-a also showed distinct spatial and temporal variations depend on the different types of IOD events. IOD classifies two patterns, which occurred during the developing ENSO (First Type IOD) and the year following ENSO event (Second Type IOD). Chl-a variation in the First Type IOD started in summer and peaked in fall around the east and west Indian Ocean. Chl-a variation in the Second Type IOD occurred started in spring, peaked in summer and fall, and disappeared in winter.

Monte Carlo Sensitivity and Uncertainty Analysis with Continuous-Energy Covariance Data,2017,,,"<P>The continuous-energy Monte Carlo (MC) sensitivity and uncertainty (S/U) analysis conducted using the multigroup covariance matrices has a theoretical pitfall in that it is inconsistent with the principle of continuous-energy MC neutronics calculations because the use of the multigroup covariance matrices means treating covariance data as multigroup variables rather than continuous-energy variables. As a way to get around this deficiency and perform the MC S/U analysis on the theoretically consistent principle, this paper presents a new continuous-energy MC S/U formulation which directly utilizes the continuous-energy covariance data in the evaluated nuclear data libraries instead of the multigroup covariance matrices produced by nuclear data processing codes. The validity of the new MC S/U formulation is examined in terms of the input-nuclear-data-induced k uncertainty of the Godiva critical assembly and the TMI-1 pin cell problem by inputting the continuous-energy covariance data of nuclides involved directly into the continuous-energy MC transport calculations by a Seoul National University MC code, McCARD.</P>"

Benefit had significant correlation with `visiting dental clinic (OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.14-2.19)`. Salience had significant correlation with `experience of not-treated oral disease (OR 0.70; 95% CI 0.52-0.94)`. Barrier had significant correlation with `visiting dental clinic (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.56-0.95)` and `removing oral plaque (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.52-0.95)`. There was no significant correlation between oral health belief and `using of oral hygiene device` or `regular tooth brushing`. Conclusions: Diverse oral health behaviors were affected by susceptibility, benefit, salience and barrier in oral health belief. The programs for oral health education and preventing oral disease should be prepared to change oral health belief to promote the oral health systematically based on the results of this study."
Formation and Hydrogen Absorption Properties of Intermetallic Mg-Ni Compound Nanoparticles,2017,"['Mg-Ni nanoparticles', 'Intermetallic compound', 'Arc discharge', 'Hydrogen', 'Storage', 'Mg-NI 나노입자', '금속 간 화합물', '아크 방전', '수소', '수소저장']",,"Mg-Ni nanoparticles were synthesized by a physical vapor condensation method (DC arc-discharge) in a mixture of argon and hydrogen atmosphere, using compressed mixture of micro powders as the raw materials. The crystal phases, morphology, and microstructures of nanoparticles were analyzed by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). It was found that the intermetallic compounds of Mg2Ni and MgNi2 formed with existence of phases of Mg, Ni, and MgO in Mg-Ni nanoparticles. After one cycle of hydrogen absorption/desorption process (activation treatment), Mg-Ni nanoparticles exhibited excellent hydrogen absorption properties. Mg2Ni phase became the main phase by aphase transformation during the hydrogen treatments. The phenomenon of refinement of grain size in the nanoparticle was also observed after the hydrogen absorption/desorption processes, which was attributed to the effect of volume expansion/shrinkage and subsequent break of nanoparticles. Maximum hydrogen absorption contents are 1.75, 2.21 and 2.77 wt.% at 523, 573 and 623 K, respectively."
Effect of Temperature and Stress on Creep Behavior of Ultrafine Grained Nanocrystalline Ni-3 at% Zr Alloy,2017,"['molecular dynamics', 'creep', 'nanostructured materials', 'deformation', 'computer simulation']",,"In this paper, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation based study of creep behavior for nanocrystalline (NC)Ni-3 at% Zr alloy having grain size ~ 6 nm has been performed using embedded atom method (EAM) potentialto study the influence of variation of temperature (1220-1450 K) as well as change in stress (0.5-1.5 GPa) oncreep behavior. All the simulated creep curves for this ultra-fine grained NC Ni-Zr alloy has extensive tertiarycreep regime. Primary creep regime is very short and steady state creep part is almost absent. The effect of temperaturesand stress is prominent on the nature of the simulated creep curves and corresponding atomicconfigurations. Additionally, mean square displacement calculation has been performed at 1220 K, 1250 K,1350 K, and 1450 K temperatures to correlate the activation energy of atomic diffusion and creep. Theactivation energy of creep process found to be less compared to activation energies of self-diffusion for Ni andZr in NC Ni-3 at% Zr alloy. Formation of martensite is identified during creep process by common neighbouranalysis. Presence of dislocations is observed only in primary regime of creep curve up till 20 ps, asevident from calculated dislocation density through MD simulations. Coble creep is found to be main operativemechanism for creep deformation of ultrafine grained NC Ni-3 at% Zr alloy."
"Velocity Fluctuations Driven by the Damped, Aperiodic Mode in the Intergalactic Medium",2017,,,"<P>On account of its finite temperature, the unmagnetized intergalactic medium (IGM) is subject to thermal fluctuations. Due to the fundamental coupling between particles and fields in a plasma, the field fluctuations generate current densities by means of the Lorentz force and thereby affect both the density and the velocity fluctuations of the particles. Recently, a new damped, aperiodic mode was discovered that dominates field fluctuations in the IGM. Apart from its impact on the transport properties of the IGM that determine the propagation of cosmic rays, previous research has shown that this mode provides turbulent magnetic seed fields of 6 x 10(-18)G that are an essential ingredient in the generation of cosmic magnetic fields. The current investigation addresses the influence of the mode on the particle motion. In order to describe the corresponding state of the turbulence, both the spectrum and the integrated total value of the mode-driven proton velocity fluctuations are computed. It is found that the latter amounts to 1.16 x 10(8)T(4)(7/2)n(-7-)(1/2)cm s(-1) assuming a temperature of T-e = T-p = 10(4) T4K and a density of n(e) = n(p) = 10(-7)cm(-3). This value is two orders of magnitude larger than the thermal velocity. If the IGM neutrals adopt the same velocities as the protons by mutual charge exchange and elastic collisions (ambipolar diffusion), atomic lines propagating through the IGM are expected to display spectral broadening, enhanced by a factor of 90 beyond the thermal level in the case of hydrogen. This opens the window to a first direct observation of the damped aperiodic mode. Other observational techniques such as dispersion measure, rotation measure, and scintillation data are not applicable in this case because the mode is a transverse one, and, as such, it does not induce the required density fluctuations, as is shown here.</P>"

Numerical simulation of kink angle prediction for non-lubricated surface crack subjected to Hertzian pressure,2017,"['Hertzian pressure', 'Kink angle', 'Numerical simulation', 'Surface crack']",,"Analysis of determining linear fracture mechanics parameters for a surface crack loaded with Hertzian pressure without the presence of a lubricant in the crack is presented. For this purpose, the elements of Williams equation for describing stresses near the crack tip are determined: Stress intensity factors K I and K II , and T-stress, which were taken into account when determing the direction of crack propagation by means of Strain energy density (SED) criterion. The elements are determined based on the case of a gear tooth flank, with various friction coefficients on the free surface and friction in the crack being taken into account. The results show that friction on the free surface and, consequently, tangential forces have an impact on whether the crack will propagate along the free surface or into the depth."

Conjugated heat transfer was analyzed with the combined effects of conduction through the test plates and convective heat transfer due to the arrayed jet impingement. The inclination angle of the film cooling holes was 35° and that of the jet impingement holes was 90°. The film and jet impingement holes on each plate were arranged in staggered patterns, and the film cooling holes and jet impingement holes were also positioned in a staggered pattern. The jet Reynolds number, based on hole diameter, was 3000 and the equivalent blowing ratio was 0.3. The diameter of the film cooling holes and the jet impingement holes was 5mm. The distance between jet and film hole plates was varied in the range 1⩽ <I>H</I>/<I>d</I> ⩽5. Total cooling effectiveness was measured with and without jet impingement. When jet impingement was added to the internal cooling, the averaged total cooling effectiveness was enhanced about 8.4%. At low Biot numbers, meaning that cooling performance dominated over the conduction effect, the temperature distribution became more uniform due to higher conductive heat transfer. The total cooling effectiveness was strongly related to the Biot number of the plate, and the correlation between total cooling effectiveness at various Biot numbers was determined to predict the total cooling effectiveness in an actual gas turbine engine.

If evoked potential to electrical stimulus is recorded in primary visual (V1) cortex, it means that the stimulus effectively evokes visual perception. Therefore, in this study, we established VEP recording system on V1 cortex using BioPAC modules as the judging tool. And the measuring system was evaluated by recording VEP of mice. After anesthesia, normal mice (C57BL/6J strain; n = 6) were secured to stereotaxic apparatus (Harvard Apparatus, USA). For the recording of VEP, the stainless steel needle electrode (impedance: $2-5k{\Omega}$) was positioned on the surface of the cortex through the burr hole at 2.5 mm lateral and 4.6 mm caudal to bregma. DA 100C and EEG 100C BioPAC modules were used for the trigger signal and VEP recording, respectively. When left eye was blocked by black cover and right eye was stimulated by flash light using HMsERG (RetVet Corp, USA), VEP response at left V1 cortex was detected, but there was no response at right V1 cortex. Amplitudes and latencies of P2, N3 peaks of VEP recording varied according to the depths of the electrodes on V1 cortex. From the surface upto $600{\mu}m$ depth, amplitudes of P2 and N3 increased, while deeper than $600{\mu}m$, those amplitudes decreased. The deeper the insertion depth of the electrode, the latency of N1 peaks tends to be delayed. However, there was no statistically significant difference among the latencies of P2 and N3 peaks (P > 0.05, ANOVA). Our VEP recording data such as the insertion depth and the latency and amplitudes of peaks might be used as guidelines for electrically-evoked potential (EEP) recording experiment in near future."

We prepared the Pd-Ru membrane with thickness of ~6 μm on a tubular stainless steel support (diameter 12.7mm, length 25 cm) using electroless plating, which was observed for the membrane performance using hydrogen and nitrogen. Gas permeation test carried out at 773 K and 31.4 kPa of pressure difference between retentate and permeate sides showed that the hydrogen permeation rate and nitrogen leakage were ~0.1050mol s−1 m−2 and ~0.0018 mol s−1 m−2, respectively. The MSR reaction was under the following conditions: temperature 773 K, pressure 100-250 kPa, gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) 837 h−1, and steam-to-carbon feed ratio (S/C) 3. The MSR reaction result showed that methane conversion was increased with increasing pressure difference and reached ~77.5% at 250 kPa. In this condition, the composition of carbon monoxide was ~2%, meaning that no two series of water gas shift reactors were needed in our membrane reactor system. Longterm stability test carried out for ~100 h showed that methane conversion and the hydrogen yield remained constant."

Therefore, the performance of complex core exercise for 12 weeks showed statistically significant changes in body fat mass, body weight, muscle mass, body fat percentage, and BMI in all groups, especially in the high obesity group. This change is the result of improvement in the functionality of the exercise program through combining the merits of complex and core exercise."

Outcome measured by the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test-Korean (AUDIT-K) for the drinking-habit, Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) for the occupation, and Self-Efficacy Scale (SES) for the self-efficacy. As a results, brief intervention shows significant improvement for drinking-habit and self-efficacy (p=.00). However, brief intervention shows no significant difference for occupation (p=.87). Those results means that brief intervention is an effective method on drinking-habit and self-efficacy among college students with problem drinking. Further studies need to perform with more participants and to develop the various intervention for occupation."
The “Three National Treasures of Silla (新羅三寶)” and Their Transfer: The Symbol of the Unification of the Koryŏ Dynasty,2017,"['Three National Treasures of Silla', 'jade belt bestowed by the heavens', 'sixteen-foot bronze Buddha statue', 'nine-tiered pagoda at Hwangnyong Temple', 'King Kyŏngsun', 'T‟aejo Wang Kŏn', 'historical legitimacy', '신라삼보(新羅三寶)', '천사옥대(天賜玉帶)', '장육존상(丈六尊像)', '황룡사9 층탑', '경순왕', '태조 왕건', '역사적 정통성']",,"This paper explores the significance of the three national treasures of Silla (Silla sambo) in the history of Koryŏ through analyzing the significance of the Three National Treasures of Silla.There are the three national in Silla—a sixteen-foot bronze Buddha statue and a nine-tiered pagoda at Hwangnyong Temple, and the jade belt bestowed by the heavens. These are made from the time of King Chinhŭng to the time of Queen Sŏndŏk. Moreover, these treasures came to occupy the status of treasures that protect the nation, as the mere existence of the treasures was able to persuade the “king of Koryŏ” to abandon his plan to attach Silla. As a result, the treasures were made by the kings of the “sacred bone” sŏng’gol with the Buddhist background, and again, the treasures added to power and authority to the “sacred bone” sŏng’gol family, so the treasure „Sambo‟ became a symbol of the nation.The stories that demonstrate the miraculous powers of the three national treasures of Silla appear in the legends of the nine-tiered pagoda of Hwangnyong Temple and of the jade belt. And it is correct to understand that the “king of Koryŏ” mentioned in these stories is a “king of Koguryŏ” rather than Wang Kŏn, the founder of the Koryŏ dynasty. Above all, it is important to take into consideration the fact that the Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms was compiled in the Koryŏ dynasty. Therefore in the Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms, Koryŏ is consistently referred to as “this dynasty” and Wang Kŏn as “T‟aejo.” Such circumstances eliminate the possibility that T‟aejo would have been referred to as simply the “king of Koryŏ.” T‟aejo Wang Kŏn, who was aware of the need for and had the will to unify the then-divided three kingdoms, or Samhan, showed interest in the three treasures of Silla. Then in 935 and 937, the three treasures were handed over to Wang Kŏn after Silla‟s surrender and through Kim Pu‟s presentation of the jade belt to T‟aejo. And in 936, T‟aejo achieved the “unification of Samhan.” In the end, the transfer of 'the treasures' is the 'gift' of Silla, which means that Koryŏ inherited the legitimacy of Silla through the achievement of the unification of the Three Kingdoms."

Effect of phosphorus deficiency on erythrocytic morphology and function in cows,2017,"['cow', 'erythrocyte', 'function', 'morphology', 'phosphorus deficiency']",,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of phosphorus (P) deficiency on the morphological and functional characteristics of erythrocytes in cows. Forty Holstein-Friesian dairy cows in mid-lactation were randomly divided into two groups of 20 each and were fed either a low-P diet (0.03% P/kg dry matter [DM]) or a control diet (0.36% P/kg DM). Red blood cell (RBC) indices results showed RBC and mean corpuscular hemoglobin decreased while mean corpuscular volume increased significantly (p ＜ 0.05) in P-deficient cows. Erythrocyte morphology showed erythrocyte destruction in P-deficient cows. Erythrocytes’ functional characteristics results showed total bilirubin and indirect bilirubin concentrations and aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase activity levels in the serum of P-deficient cows were significantly higher than those in control diet-fed cows. Activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in erythrocytes were lower, while the malondialdehyde content was greater, in P-deficient cows than in control diet-fed cows. Na+/K+-ATPase and Mg2+-ATPase activities were lower in P-deficient cows than in control diet-fed cows; however, Ca2+-ATPase activity was not significantly different. The phospholipid composition of the erythrocyte membrane changed and membrane fluidity rigidified in P-deficient cows. The results indicate that P deficiency might impair erythrocyte integrity and functional characteristics in cows."

Response to the Editor,2017,,,"Thank you for your letter to our publication in Osteoporosis and Sarcopenia entitled on “Recent nutritional trend of calcium and vitamin D in East Asia”. Although the increase in calcium nutrition from food in postmenopausal women is urgent issue, Dr Yoo Kyoung Park pointed out that our claim is still premature to apply to whole population. As Dr Y-K Park pointed out that the KNHANES study had been limited the age ( 50 years of age) of the participants and the findings about calcium insufficiency should not be expanded into entire population [1].On the other hand, the National Nutrition Survey in Japan [2] was subjected community dwelling household (n ¼ 3507) including the people aged over 1 year. Therefore, the participants of this research consisted of entire generation of Japan.The report of the National Nutritional Survey in Japan indicated that the calcium intake in younger generation (420e454 mg/ day for age 20e40 years old) was less than postmenopausal women (568e546 mg/day for sixties and seventies). In addition, total caloric intake of younger generation (1706 and 1652 kcal/day for twenties and forties, respectively) and the postmenopausal women (1766 and 1639 kcal/day for sixties and seventies, respectively) were almost same level suggesting that the calcium density in foods (Calcium in mg/day/Caloric intake in k Cal) was around 30% less in the younger generation (0.25e0.27 mg/kcal) than those in the older generation (0.32e0.33 mg/kcal). As it was written in our article, the calcium intake in older generation was still far less from the calcium requirement (788 mg/day for old women or 0.48 mg/kcal) [3]. Therefore, the postmenopausal women, who had relatively high calcium intake, took calcium around 70% of requirement.Although there was no available data regarding the effect of calcium intake on the development of peak bone mass in a prospective study design in Asian population, the low calcium intake seen in a younger generation in Japan strongly suggested that the development of proper peak bone mass may not be achieved by the recent young generation in Japan. Bone health has been reported to improve in Vietnamese postmenopausal women, who were received nutritional education [4]. Therefore, re-education regarding calcium intake will be required for the younger population. On the other hand, since the older generation in Japan had been adapted to the traditional dietary custom, it may be difficult to increase in calcium intake from the foods, further. Thus, we propose to take calcium supplement for the older generation.Since bone mineralization abnormalities in VDR knock out mice was recovered by increasing calcium and phosphate intakes [5], intestinal calcium absorption is an essential factor to promote bone calcification rather than vitamin D. Thus, the insufficient intake of calcium seen in recent Japan may be critical in not only postmenopausal women but also in the younger generation, and that is why we emphasized our concern for all Japanese generation.The intestinal calcium absorption is higher in the people with habitually low calcium intake through active transport system by calcitriol especially in younger generation [6]. On the other hand, the intestinal adaptation for low calcium intake may not properly active in elderly people because of low production of 1,25(OH)2D in kidney [7]. Therefore, passive transport of calcium, which is facilitated by high calcium intake, may have a meaningful role on the bone metabolism in the older people. In addition to high calcium intake, vitamin D nutrition also plays an important role on bone health. As Dr.Yoo Kyoung Park pointed out properly, we could not present vitamin D nutritional status in our National Nutritional survey, because the research did not measure serum level of 25(OH)D in the participants. However, the survey was reported the vitamin D intake from food in the participants. The mean intake of vitamin D in the female participants age..."

We aimed to clarify how the interaction between urinary incontinence and depression influences one’s QOL.Methods：A total of 1262 patients were enrolled in this study from April, 2011 to July, 2011. We estimated the severity of depressive symptoms and QOL, using SGDS-K, EQ-5D. We also investigated the morbidity of urinary incontinence for each patient in person or by questionnaire. Comparisons of QOL between groups with or without depression, with or without urinary incontinence were established using t-test, ANOVA and Scheffe’s post hoc analysis. The interaction between urinary incontinence and depression was analyzed by each domain of QOL, using multiple regression analysis.Results：Patients with depression and urinary incontinence showed significantly higher EQ-5D scores on every domain of QOL than other patients, which means significantly lower QOL. Patients with depression, no urinary incontinence reported lower QOL, especially in the domain of ‘usual activity’, ‘anxiety’ and ‘visual analogue scale(VAS)’, whereas those with urinary incontinence, no depression showed lower QOL in ‘motility’, ‘usual activities’ and ‘pain’ domain. Statistically significant interaction effects of two diseases were observed in the domain of ‘VAS’, ‘self care’ and ‘anxiety’.Conclusions：Comorbidity of urinary incontinence and depression showed significantly lower QOL of patients, compared with urinary incontinence or depression respectively, which implies additive interaction effects of the two diseases. Optimal diagnosis and treatment of depression should be emphasized for patients with urinary incontinence."

The subjects were 42 community residents who participated in a cognitive rehabilitation program related to dementia in a Chungbuk area. MMSE-K and BCoS(Birmingham Cognitive Screen) apraxia test were administered to all subjects. The apraxia test includes three types of tasks, gesture production tasks that make meaningful movements according to verbal instructions, gesture recognition tasks that display behavior after make sense of meanings, and meaningless imitation task. Apraxia group(n=30, MMSE-K mean score: 25) showed lower cognitive function than group without apraxia(n=12, MMSE-K mean score: 28). All tasks in the apraxia test showed a significant correlation with cognitive function, but the meaningless imitation task had a negligible correlation. The apraxia test is a good way to assess cognitive function, and it may be more effective to use meaningful behavior to replace cognitive testing."

In particular, the influence of the outer shell, mid-layer, and liningconstituting the firefighter’s protective clothing on the thermal protective performance was compared for convection andradiation heat sources. Tests for the thermal protective performance were carried out according to KS K ISO 9151(convection), KS K ISO 6942 (radiation), and KS K ISO 17492 (convection and radiation). When tested under the sameincident heat flux conditions (80 kW/m2), the heat transfer index (t12 and t24) for the radiation heat source was higher thanthat for the convection heat source. This means that radiation has a lesser effect than convection. For the convection heatsource, the lining had the greatest effect on the thermal protective performance, followed by the mid-layer and the outer shell.On the other hand, for the radiation heat source, the effect on the thermal protective performance was great in the order oflining, outer shell, and mid-layer. Convection and radiation have fundamentally different mechanisms of heat transfer, anddifferent heat sources can lead to different thermal protective performance results depending on the material composition.Therefore, to evaluate the thermal protective performance of the firefighter’s protective clothing, it is important to test not onlythe convection heat source, but also the radiation heat source."

Methods：A stratified random cluster sample of 625 community-dwelling old people living alone in Daegu completed a questionnaire through face-to-face interview. Quality of life was evaluated using the World Health Organization quality of life-brief(WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire. Depression was measured using the geriatric depression scale short form-Korea(GDSSF-K). The other data including sociodemographic characteristics, emotional and economical support, perceived health status and activity of daily living were collected. The data were analyzed using independent t-test, ANOVA, multiple regression analysis to evaluate the relationship between quality of life and other variables.  Results：Subjects were composed of 107 male(17.1%) and 518 female(82.9%) and their mean age was 75.5 (SD= 5.8). Multiple regression analysis showed that quality of life was significantly associated with depression, psychiatric illness, educational level, income level, presence of caregiver, and whether living alone was a voluntary decision. Depression was the most influential factor affecting quality of life. Participants suffering more severe depression had lower quality of life.  Conclusion：Present study suggested that the quality of life in the elderly living alone should be recognized in a multiple perspective ways considering psychosocial approach as well as clinical symptoms. We also would like to emphasize the comprehensive multidisciplinary team approach for improvement of the quality of life in elderly people who live alone."

The results indicated that the elastic modulus increased linearly with the density relative to a single crystal, but decreased with increasing temperature. The simulated nanocrystalline U0.5Th0.5O2 exhibited a breakdown in the HallePetch relation with mean grain size varying from 3.0 nm to 18.0 nm. Moreover, the elastic modulus of U1-yThyO2 solid solutions with different content of thorium at 300 K was also studied and the results accorded well with the experimental data available in the literature. In addition, the fracture mode of nanocrystalline U0.5Th0.5O2 was inclined to be ductile because the fracture behavior was preceded by some moderate amount of plastic deformation, which is different from what has been seen earlier in simulations of pure UO2."

The amount of available $SiO_2$ was increased significantly from 2011 to over the recommendation level (${\geq}157mg\;kg^{-1}$). It was revealed that the soil chemical properties of rice paddy fields was influenced by topology, soil texture, type and region as result of principal component analysis or cluster analysis. Therefore, an assessment on chemical properties of rice paddy soils should be performed to consider various soil physical conditions and agronomic practices such as fertilization, cropping system, and so on. Because of the high variability of nutrient levels across Gyeongbuk Province, nutrient management based on soil fertility test is required by respective farm land unit."
A Study on the Legal Consciousness of Female University Students through Information Analysis,2017,"['Legal Consciousness', 'Constitutionalism', 'Fairness', 'Law-Abiding Spirit', 'Law and Order']",,"The Legal Consciousness is a feeling or attitude toward the law from the people. Most Korean had a traditional consciousness that did not consider the law so friendly, also, the perception of law is also very negative is the common result of various investigations so far. This is caused by a distrust of the political power that operates the law than just distrust of law. Moreover, it is a serious problem that these negative attitudes are getting stronger over time. Especially when looking at the situation of the monopoly of government affairs in Park Geun-hye administration, the law was not a means of realizing social justice on the side of the socially weak, it has come to the fact that the law has been recognized as a tool of oppression by the ruling group, which seizes power in a fraudulent manner and accumulates economic wealth. It was a really ridiculous incident. In addition, not all citizens need to be experts in law, but the law is a bowl for society, and filling the bowl is a moral form or value of society in general. And since society has a peculiar law, and the modern state has the rule of law as its basic principle, most human acts have a direct relationship with law.  In particular, it is true that the problem of the legal consciousness of college students is frequently mentioned today. Therefore, in this study, through the examine the contents of the legal consciousness of the K university female students in Gwangju and will consider the cause of this."
"Clinical, Pathologic, and Genetic Features of Collagen VI-Related Myopathy in Korea",2017,"['collagen', 'muscular diseases', 'genetic testing.']",,"Background and Purpose Mutations in collagen VI-related genes (COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3) cause Bethlem myopathy (BM) and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD). These were previously believed to be separate disease entities, but they are now both classified as collagen VI-related myopathies, which cover a broad clinical spectrum. We aimed to analyze the clinical, pathologic, and genetic characteristics of patients with collagen VI-related myopathy in Korea. Methods We reviewed the clinical, pathologic, and genetic features in 22 patients with collagen VI-related myopathy from 13 families, as confirmed by genetic analysis of collagen VI-related genes. Results The mean ages of the 22 patients at first symptom presentation and diagnosis were 4.5 and 24.9 years, respectively. Four patients in 4 families showed the phenotype of intermediate collagen VI-related myopathies (IM), 16 patients in 7 families had the BM phenotype, and 2 patients in 2 families presented with the typical UCMD phenotype. Based on genetic analysis, five patients (five families) comprising four with IM and one with typical UCMD had missense mutations in the triple-helical domain of COL6A1, and ten patients (four families) with BM showed exon-14-skipping mutations. Additionally, we found two novel mutations: c.956A> G (p.K319R) in COL6A1 and c.6221G>T (p.G2074V) in COL6A3. Conclusions Missense mutations in the triple-helical domain of COL6A1 are the most common mutations related to collagen VI-related myopathy in Korea. Patients with these mutations have a tendency toward an earlier disease onset and more severe progression compared to patients with other mutations."

Further experimental and numerical studies are made for the development of a hybrid-type EBU model in order to evaluate the non-equilibrium effect of HFC-134a reaction in a tubular reactor. For the numerical calculation using the hybrid-type EBU model, especially, the relative rate of the turbulent mixing and chemical reaction should be incorporated in a harmonic mean expression. Thus the overall reaction rate expression of HFC-134a reaction is determined by the fitting the empirical constants with experimental data obtained in the tubular reactor via trial and error method.

The participant was a middle-aged female patient who had been suffering from schizophrenia and held in a closed ward for more than 3 years. In total, 80 sessions of art therapy were carried out. The change in quality of life was monitored through records of art therapy procedures, observation of behavior by hospital staffs, the HTP test, and the Korean version of 4th revision of Schizophrenia Quality of Life (SQLS-R4K). The results showed the following. First, the participant experienced decreased anxiety, helplessness, and atrophy, and increased emotional stability through the emotional nurturing experiences from art therapy, enabling her to lead a normal life in the hospital and eventually upgrading her quality of life. Second, according to the HTP test, the participant showed less anxiety, helplessness, and atrophy, and the changed attitude allowed the participant to have a positive relationship with others. Third, according to SQLS-R4K, the drop in the result from 57.57 to 25.75 means the participant’s quality of life increased in the psychosocial feelings domain, cognition domain, and vitality domain. Therefore, art therapy could help positively influence a chronic schizophrenic patient’s quality of life and lead her to have a normal life thanks to the emotional nurturing experiences."
Design of hydro electromagnetic and piezoelectric energy harvesters for a smart water meter system,2017,"['Non-contact energy harvester', 'Impedance matching', 'Electromagnetic energy harvester', 'Piezoelectric energy harvester', 'Smart water meter system', 'Water leakage warning system']",,"<P>In this paper, a turn-buclde type stainless steel waterwheel with a diameter of 90 mm and two pole magnets was proposed, as turn-buckle type waterwheels do not require any hole in the pipe unlike other self-powered water meters that use DC motor-based energy generation. In addition, by designing non-contact energy harvesters using magnets, the proposed energy harvesters are semi-permanent. The performance of the manufactured energy harvesters was analyzed under experimental conditions in a flowing water setup composed of a PVC pipe and a water pump. The electrical output power of the energy harvesters was measured under various load resistance conditions. The maximum root mean square (RMS) output power of the electromagnetic and the piezoelectric energy harvesters were 648 mW at 200 Omega and 0.196 mW at 10 k Omega, respectively. The generated electrical energy works differently. The energy harvested by the electromagnetic energy harvester is used to be a power source for the smart water meter system while the energy harvested by the piezoelectric energy harvester is used to be a water leakage detector for the water leakage warning system.

Highly ordered copper oxide (Cu2O) nanopillar arrays using template assisted electrodeposition technique and their temperature dependent electrical characteristics,2017,"['Copper oxide', 'Nanopillars', 'Electrodeposition', 'Electron transport', 'Metal-semiconductor contacts']",,"Highly ordered Copper Oxide (Cu2O) nanopillars were successfully grown inside the porous anodized alumina (AAO) template by electrodeposition technique. To liberate the AAO template to get the free standing nanopillars, several etching trials were conducted using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution of varying concentration (ranging from 1 M to 5 M) and reaction time (8e60 min). On investigating the etched samples using scanning electron microscope, it was found that the sample treated with 1 M NaOH for 60 min yielded AAO template free standing vertically aligned nanopillars. Resistances of these nanopillars were found to be three orders of magnitude greater than the thin film which was used as a control sample. The temperature dependent (180e300 K) current-voltage (I-V) measurement on nanopillars showed non-linear characteristics which was analyzed using back to back schottky diode model and thermionic field emission (TFE) theory. Our calculations revealed that the carrier transport is diffusive (mean free path ¼ 8.9 nm < < length of nanopillars ¼ 4 mm) in nature and the existence of defect sites with activation energies of 0.3 and 0.6 eV which acts as hole traps. This present work demonstrates a reliable technique for realizing vertically aligned Cu2O nanopillars which could find application in solar cell, gas sensors, Li ion batteries, and memory devices."

잠재 토픽 기반의 제품 평판 마이닝,2017,"['토픽 모델', '오피니언 마이닝', '텍스트 요약', '데이터 분석', '여론조사', 'topic model', 'opinion mining', 'text summarization', 'data analytics', 'public survey']",,"Data-drive analytics techniques have been recently applied to public surveys. Instead of simply gathering survey results or expert opinions to research the preference for a recently launched product, enterprises need a way to collect and analyze various types of online data and then accurately figure out customer preferences.  In the main concept of existing data-based survey methods, the sentiment lexicon for a particular domain is first constructed by domain experts who usually judge the positive, neutral, or negative meanings of the frequently used words from the collected text documents. In order to research the preference for a particular product, the existing approach collects (1) review posts, which are related to the product, from several product review web sites; (2) extracts sentences (or phrases) in the collection after the pre-processing step such as stemming and removal of stop words is performed; (3) classifies the polarity (either positive or negative sense) of each sentence (or phrase) based on the sentiment lexicon; and (4) estimates the positive and negative ratios of the product by dividing the total numbers of the positive and negative sentences (or phrases) by the total number of the sentences (or phrases) in the collection. Furthermore, the existing approach automatically finds important sentences (or phrases) including the positive and negative meaning to/against the product. As a motivated example, given a product like Sonata made by Hyundai Motors, customers often want to see the summary note including what positive points are in the ‘car design’ aspect as well as what negative points are in thesame aspect. They also want to gain more useful information regarding other aspects such as ‘car quality’, ‘car performance’, and ‘car service.’ Such an information will enable customers to make good choice when they attempt to purchase brand-new vehicles. In addition, automobile makers will be able to figure out the preference and positive/negative points for new models on market. In the near future, the weak points of the models will be improved by the sentiment analysis. For this, the existing approach computes the sentiment score of each sentence (or phrase) and then selects top-k sentences (or phrases) with the highest positive and negative scores.  However, the existing approach has several shortcomings and is limited to apply to real applications. The main disadvantages of the existing approach is as follows:  (1) The main aspects (e.g., car design, quality, performance, and service) to a product (e.g., Hyundai Sonata) are not considered. Through the sentiment analysis without considering aspects, as a result, the summary note including the positive and negative ratios of the product and top-k sentences (or phrases) with the highest sentiment scores in the entire corpus is just reported to customers and car makers. This approach is not enough and main aspects of the target product need to be considered in the sentiment analysis.  (2) In general, since the same word has different meanings across different domains, the sentiment lexicon which is proper to each domain needs to be constructed. The efficient way to construct the sentiment lexicon per domain is required because the sentiment lexicon construction is labor intensive and time consuming.  To address the above problems, in this article, we propose a novel product reputation mining algorithm that (1) extracts topics hidden in review documents written by customers; (2) mines main aspects based on the extracted topics; (3) measures the positive and negative ratios of the product using the aspects; and (4) presents the digest in which a few important sentences with the positive and negative meanings are listed in each aspect. Unlike the existing approach, using hidden topics makes experts construct the sentimental lexicon easily and quickly. Furthermore, reinforcing topic semantics, we can improve the accuracy of the product reputati"

(1) 선언문에서 단어‘tathāgatagarbha’는, 소유복합어로서 ‘tathāgatadhātugarbha’가 ‘stūpa’를 수식(즉, ‘여래의유물을가진stūpa’) 하는 다른 대승 경전에서 증명되듯이, ‘tathāgatadhātugarbhān stūpān, dhātugarbhe caitye’ (유물을 가진 caitya (sadhātuke caitye)라는표현으로 바꿔 말할 수도 있다.) 등과 같은 표현을전제할 것이다. (2) 이 선언문에서 불교 비문(碑文)의 ‘dhātudhṛk’ 나 ‘dhātudharaḥ’와 같은(둘 다stūpaḥ를 생략) 표현에서 발견되는 동일한 생략, 곧 명사 ‘stūpa’의 생략을 반영할 수 있을 것이다. (3) <<열반경>>의 선언문은 자연스럽게 (법신(dharmakāya)과 여래장(tathāgatagarbha)의 관점으로부터 <<열반경>>에서 재해석되는) 여래의 열반(tathāgata’s nirvāṇa)과 탑에 있는 그의 유물을 다루는 <<열반경>>의 주요 주제와 연결되어야 한다. (4) <<열반경>>은 모든 존재들은 실제 ‘stūpa/caitya’라고 정확히 선언하고, 이 선언은 “모든 존재들은 ‘tathāgatagarbha(즉, stūpa)’를 가진다(tathāgatagarbhaḥ sarvasattvānāṃ)”는 구와 맥락상 일치한다. (5) <<열반경>>의 산스크리트 구절에서 “우리 위에 tathāgatagarbha가 있다(asmākam upari tathāgatagarbho ‘sti)”에는 또 다른 해석이 있을수있다. 이 표현에서 단어‘tathāgatagarbha’는 위에 언급된 해석 과 위배되지 않고, 오히려 이 것은 <<법화경>>(Saddharmapuṇḍarīka)의 유명한 장면을 상기시킨다. 즉, 청중들 위 하늘로 올라오는 ‘stūpa’다(saptaratnamayaḥ stūpo ’bhyudgataḥ ... parṣanmaṇḍalasyopari vaihāyasaṃ tiṣṭhet). 따라서, 나는 이 선언문 속에서 단어‘tathāgatagarbhaḥ’를 잠정적으로‘stūpa’ 를 수식하는 소유복합어로 해석할 것을 제안한다. 그러나, 나는 단어의 부차적인 의미로 ‘tathāgatagarbha’를 격한정복합어로 해설하는 것이 가능하다고 생각한다. 왜냐하면 시모다 마사히로나 미하일 라디치가 이미 지적하였듯이 ‘garbha’라는 단어의 의미가 풍부하기 때문에, 두세 가지의 의미로 단어를 사용할 수도 있기 때문이다.","In this paper, I shall propose a hypothetical interpretation of the phrase tathāgatagarbhaḥ sarvasattvānāṃ, which is a declarative formula of the Mahāparinirvāṇamahāsūtra (abbr. MPMS) and is preserved as original Sanskrit. This phrase confirms that the word tathāgatagarbha—if this is a bahuvrīhi compound—cannot grammatically go with the word sattvānāṃ unlike the case of the Tathāgatagarbhasūtra, in which tathāgatagarbha, being a bahuvrīhi, qualifies the noun sattva (sarvasattvās tathāgatagarbhāḥ). Previous studies have mostly interpreted tathāgatagarbhaḥ of the MPMS, as a tatpuruṣa, whereas I shall keep this as a bahuvrīhi and take it to be an adjective which qualifies some undescribed noun—that is, stūpa, omitted in the phrase, based on the following reasons: (1) The word tathāgatagarbha in the formula is probably premising such expressions like tathāgatadhātugarbhān stūpān, dhātugarbhe caitye (which is paraphrased by the expression sadhātuke caitye “a caitya that contains relics”), etc., as found in other Mahāyāna scriptures, where tathāgatadhātugarbha, as a bahuvrīhi, qualifies the noun stūpa “a stūpa that contains tathāgata's relics”; (2) the omission of the noun stūpa in the formula might reflect the same omission found in expressions, such as dhātudhṛk or dhātudharaḥ (both omitting stūpaḥ), as found in Buddhist inscriptions; (3) The declarative formula of the MPMS should naturally be relevant to the main topic of the MPMS, which deals with tathāgata's nirvāṇa and his relics that were found in stūpas (which, in turn, are reinterpreted in the MPMS from the viewpoint of the dharmakāya and tathāgatagarbha); (4) The MPMS precisely declares that all beings are real stūpa/caitya, and this declaration fits well with the phrase tathāgatagarbhaḥ sarvasattvānāṃ “all beings have tathāgatagarbha (i.e. stūpa)”; (5) We find yet another expression (asmākam upari tathāgatagarbho 'sti “there is tathāgatagarbha above us”) in the Sanskrit fragment of the MPMS; however, the word tathāgatagarbha, in this expression, does not disturb the above- mentioned interpretation. Instead, this reminds us of the famous scene taught in the Saddharmapuṇḍarīka—the stūpa arising in the sky above the audience: saptaratnamayaḥ stūpo ’bhyudgataḥ ... parṣanmaṇḍalasyopari vaihāyasaṃ tiṣṭhet. Accordingly, I shall tentatively propose to interpret the word tathāgatagarbhaḥ in the formula as a bahuvrīhi which qualifies the noun stūpa. I think, however, it is possible to apprehend tathāgatagarbha as a tatpuruṣa, to be the secondary meaning of the word because the MPMS most probably utilizes the word with double or triple meaning in order to preserve the semantic richness of the word garbha, which has already been pointed out by Masahiro Shimoda and Michael Radich."
“专利盒税制”(Patent Box Regime)对中国的借鉴,2017,"['?利盒?制', '技???所得?惠?制', 'BEPS第五行???', '??法', 'Patent Box Regime', 'Tax Preferential Regime for IP income', 'BEPS Action Plan 5', 'Nexus Approach']",,"This paper focuses on the Chinese Patent Box Regime. The Patent Box Regime is the preferential tax scheme for royalties or capital gains from intellectual properties which R&D performances make. In China, the government has made some legislative progress for supporting national corporations to do R&D work sufficiently and effectively. The Chinese Patent Box Regime includes tax preferential content to apply the special rate for transferring their intellectual properties such as capital gain from the IPs. It means that the tax regime chooses a little different route than other countries which operate the Patent Box Regime to apply this scheme for royalties and capital gains from the IPs.  The Patent Box Regime brings about a side effect that people usually know, tax avoidance. According to this side effect, the global society comes out to take some action for abusing the Patent Box Regime. It shapes up as the primary part of BEPS Action 5. But it doesn’t mean that the Patent Box Regime genuinely be made for tax avoidance. This paper makes a little solution to make up for weakness of the Patent Box Regime.  Chapter 2 explains the reason why the Patent Box Regime comes into the picture. In existing R&D tax schemes, it focuses on R&D costs and the front-end of R&D process. First of all, companies make sufficient R&Ds for our society, but these companies lack R&D money. However, the Patent Box Regime focuses on the diametrical position where it concentrates on the back-end of R&D process. Following this manner, the Original Patent Box Regime could measure the social effect from the IPs. The Patent Box Regime designates commercial success of the IPs such as royalties or capital gains from the IPs as a proxy of the positive social effect. Chapter 2 also examines the calculation method for taxation technically, and considers legislative examples of other countries (including OECD/G20 Actions) to choose and operate the Patent Box Regime: U.K., the Netherlands, France, Ireland, and Belgium.  Chapter 3 is an overview of the Chinese R&D tax system, including the Chinese Patent Box Regime. The Chinese government currently operates diverse tax preferential schemes for supporting R&D: deduction for R&D costs, the tax credit system for R&D, and the tax preferential scheme for innovative technology companies designated by the government. This paper explores these tax systems’ features briefly.  Chapter 4 suggests personal opinions to make up for supporting and operating the Chinese Patent Box Regime desirably. First of all, the Chinese system extends the scope of the qualified taxpayer to include PEs in China. The qualified income and asset of the Chinese Patent Box Regime could also be needed to support R&D results and adjust practical problems. It would expand the qualified IPs to allow acquired IPs from the 3rd parties. In addition to expanding the qualified IPs, applying the Patent Box Regime to the following income could be needed to increase the social effect of this tax preferential regime: short-term (under 5 years) licensing fee and embedded royalties, etc. Finally, the current Chinese Patent Box Regime needs consolidation work to compile the administrative regulation for the regime such as the U.K. example."

Relationships of Total Lymphocyte Count and Subpopulation Lymphocyte Counts with the Nutritional Status in Patients Undergoing Hemodialysis/Peritoneal Dialysis,2017,"['Dialysis', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Total Lymphocyte Counts']",,"Objectives: Dialysis patients’ nutritional indicators are quite subjective and complex and cannot be easily measured in clinical settings. Based on previous reports that total lymphocyte count (TLC) and subpopulation lymphocyte counts (SLCs) are associated with nutritional status in patients with dialysis, we designed this study to examine the relationships of the TLC and SLCs with clinical outcome and nutritional status in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD).Methods: In this prospective, observational study, we enrolled 66 patients (50 HD patients and 16 PD patients) receiving stable maintenance dialysis. We evaluated the baseline parameters of height; weight; TLC; SLCs expressing CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD19; CBC; iron profile (iron, TIBC, ferritin); BUN; Cr; Na; K; total CO2; Ca; P; iPTH; protein; albumin; total cholesterol; HDL; LDL; uric acid and CRP and calculated Onodera’s prognostic nutritional index (OPNI) and the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) at baseline and three months. To analyze differences in the TLC and SLCs between the HD group and the PD group, we performed an independent samples t-test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to predict malnutrition in dialysis patients. In addition, to analyze changes in TLC, SLCs expressing each marker (CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD19) and other nutritional markers, we performed general linear model (GLM)-repeated measures ANOVA.Results: Mean age was 55.8 ± 12.7 years in HD paitents and 49.8 ± 14.5 years in PD patients. The duration of dialysis was 59.7 ± 52.9 months in HD patients and 66.1 ± 33.6 years in PD patients. Logistic regression analysis revealed that patients aged 60 years or older, women, and those whose CD19 SLCs were lower than 100 had a higher risk of developing malnutrition. In GLM-repeated measures ANOVA, CD19 SLCs were significantly higher in women and in patients with a shorter period of dialysis.Conclusions: Our results indicate that GNRI, OPNI, TLC and SLCs (especially CD19 count) may be significant nutritional markers in HD and PD patients."
Optimization of low frequency sound absorption by cell size control and multiscale poroacoustics modeling,2017,"['Ultrasonication', 'Cell structure control', 'Acoustic damping', 'Poroacoustics modeling', 'Finite element analysis']",,"<P>Sound absorption of a polyurethane (PU) foam was predicted for various geometries to fabricate the optimum microstructure of a sound absorbing foam. Multiscale numerical analysis for sound absorption was carried out by solving flow problems in representative unit cell (RUC) and the pressure acoustics equation using Johnson-Champoux-Allard (JCA) model. From the numerical analysis, theoretical optimum cell diameter for low frequency sound absorption was evaluated in the vicinity of 400 mu m under the condition of 2 cm 80 K (thickness of 2 cm and density of 80 kg/m(3)) foam. An ultrasonic foaming method was employed to modulate microcellular structure of PU foam. Mechanical activation was only employed to manipulate the internal structure of PU foam without any other treatment. A mean cell diameter of PU foam was gradually decreased with increase in the amplitude of ultrasonic waves. It was empirically found that the reduction of mean cell diameter induced by the ultrasonic wave enhances acoustic damping efficiency in low frequency ranges. Moreover, further analyses were performed with several acoustic evaluation factors; root mean square (RMS) values, noise reduction coefficients (NRC), and 1/3 octave band spectrograms.

Wolyeong Wetlands, as abandoned paddy wetlands, are currently managed as a wetland conservation area; however, hydrological remnants and soil properties have n ot been well documented yet. This research aims to descry be geomorphic and geochemical properties of Wolyeong Wetlands. The main findings are as follows. First, Wolyeong Wetlands hold hydrological remnants such as paddy terraces, water reservoirs and irrigation ditches at least for 25 years. Second, organic matter and total nitrogen show high concentrations in water-logging areas, while available phosphates show opposite trends. Third, the concentration of exchangeable cations is Ca>Mg>K>Na or Ca>Mg>Na>K in order, and show different distribution patterns from wetland to wetland. The terrace structures help to have maintained flooding conditions after abandonment, contributing to the development of Wolyeong Wetlands. The soils in Wolyeong Wetlands show higher organic matter and Ca cation, but lower available phosphates in comparison to those of general paddy soils; it seems to suggest the sequential changes after the stop of agricultural activities. Soils in Wolyeong Wetlands belong to the higher Ca concentration group. The fact that the general paddy soils can also be classified as the same category urges us to reconsider the meaning of the higher Ca concentration as a criterion for classifying mountainous wetlands."

Furthermore, NiCoFeCrMn high-entropy alloy (HEA) exhibited the highest κ<sub>1</sub>/κ<sub>e</sub> ratio of ~1.13, because with increasing ΔS<sub>mix</sub> the reduction in lattice thermal conductivity (κ<sub>1</sub>) was less than that of electron thermal conductivity (κe). In particular, a crossover in the properties` variation was noticeable at a specific ΔS<sub>mix</sub> of ~8.3±0.3 J/mol·K, which means the properties of single phase FCC solid solutions can be optimized by modulating ΔS<sub>mix</sub>.

However, the measurement of liquid viscosity is not always easy when the materials have toxicity and instability. In this study, a modified scaled variable reduced coordinate (SVRC)-quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR) model is suggested and analyzed in terms of its performance of prediction for liquid viscosity compared to the conventional SVRC-QSPR model and the other methods. The modification was conducted by changing the initial point from triple point to ambient temperature (293 K), and assuming that the liquid viscosity at critical temperature is 0 cP. The results reveal that the prediction performance of the modified SVRC-QSPR model is comparable to the other methods as showing 7.90% of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and 0.9838 of R2. In terms of both the number of components and the performance of prediction, the modified SVRC-QSPR model is superior to the conventional SVRC-QSPR model. Also, the applicability of the model is improved since the condition of the end points of the modified model is not so restrictive as the conventional SVRC-QSPR model."

The viscosities of the CO₂-gas mixture, CO₂+CH₄, CO₂+H₂S, and CO₂+N₂ were predicted using three different models as follows : Chung, TRAPP, and REFPROP. The predictability values of the models were validated by comparing the estimated results with the experiment data for the CO₂+CH₄ and CO₂+N2 under high-density conditions. The Chung model showed 2.41%, which is the lowest mean deviation of the prediction among the model. Based on the Chung model, the mixture mole fractions were changed from 0.9, 0.95, and 0.97, the mixture pressure was ranged from 80 bar to 120 bar by 10 bar, and the mixture temperature was varied from 310 K to 400 K by 10 K to observe the effects of the parameters on the mixture viscosity. Considering the high mole fraction of the CO₂ in the mixture, a significant variation of the mixture viscosity was observed close to the pseudo-critical temperature, and the viscosity for the CO₂+H₂S mixture shows the highest values compared with those of the CO₂+CH₄ and CO₂+N₂."

"Analysis of radioactivity levels and hazard assessment of black sand samples from Rashid area, Egypt",2017,"['Black Sand', 'Environmental Impact', 'Gamma Spectrometry', 'Radioactivity Levels', 'Radiological Hazards Assessment']",,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the radioactivity levels and radiological impacts of representative black sand samples collected from different locations in the Rashid area, Egypt. These samples were prepared and then analyzed using the high-resolution gamma ray spectroscopy technique with a highpurity germanium detector. The activity concentration (Ac), minimum detectable activity, absorbed gamma dose rate, external hazard index (Hex), annual effective dose rate equivalent, radium equivalent, as well as external and internal hazard index (Hex and Hin, respectively) were estimated based on the measured radionuclide concentration of the 238U(226Ra) and 232Th decay chains and 40K. The activity concentrations of the 238U, 232Th decay series and 40K of these samples varied from 45.11 ± 3.1 Bq/kg to 252.38 ± 34.3 Bq/kg, from 64.65 ± 6.1 Bq/kg to 579.84 ± 53.1 Bq/kg, and from 403.36 ± 20.8 Bq/kg to 527.47 ± 23.1 Bq/kg, respectively. The activity concentration of 232Th in Sample 1 has the highest value compared to the other samples; this value is also higher than the worldwide mean range as reported by UNSCEAR 2000. The total absorbed gamma dose rate and the annual effective dose for these samples were found to vary from 81.19 nGy/h to 497.81 nGy/h and from 99.86 μSv/y to 612.31 μSv/y, which are higher than the world average values of 59 nGy/h and 70 μSv/y, respectively. The Hex values were also calculated to be 3.02, 0.47, 0.63, 0.87, 0.87, 0.51 and 0.91. It was found that the calculated value of Hex for Sample 1 is significantly higher than the international acceptable limit of <1.

Evaluation of the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) Index for Digital Fashion Application in Outdoor Environments,2017,"['WBGT', 'Clothing', 'Weather effect', 'Heat stress', 'Human responses', 'Sweat rate', 'Thermal sensation', 'Comfort']",,"Objective: This paper presents a study to evaluate the WBGT index for assessing the effects of a wide range of outdoor weather conditions on human responses.   Background: The Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) index was firstly developed for the assessment of hot outdoor conditions. It is a recognised index that is used world-wide. It may be useful over a range of outdoor conditions and not just for hot climates.  Method: Four group experiments, involving people performing a light stepping activity, were conducted to determine human responses to outside conditions in the U.K. They were conducted in September 2007 (autumn), December 2007 (winter), March 2008 (spring) and June 2008 (summer). Environmental measurements included WBGT, air temperature, radiant temperature (including solar load), humidity and wind speed all measured at 1.2m above the ground, as well as weather data measured by a standard weather station at 3m to 4m above the ground. Participants"" physiological and subjective responses were measured. When the overall results of the four seasons are considered, WBGT provided a strong prediction of physiological responses as well as subjective responses if aural temperature, heart rate and sweat production were measured.  Results: WBGT is appropriate to predict thermal strain on a large group of ordinary people in moderate conditions. Consideration should be given to include the WBGT index in warning systems for a wide range of weather conditions. However, the WBGT overestimated physiological responses of subjects. In addition, tenfold Borg""s RPE was significantly different with heart rate measured for the four conditions except autumn (p <0.05). Physiological and subjective responses over 60 minutes consistently showed a similar tendency in the relationships with the WBGThead and WBGTabdomen.  Conclusion: It was found that either WBGThead or WBGTabdomen could be measured if a measurement should be conducted at only one height. The relationship between the WBGT values and weather station data was also investigated. There was a significant relationship between WBGT values at the position of a person and weather station data. For UK daytime weather conditions ranging from an average air temperature of 6°C to 21℃ with mean radiant temperatures of up to 57℃, the WBGT index could be used as a simple thermal index to indicate the effects of weather on people.  Application: The result of evaluation of WBGT might help to develop the smart clothing for workers in industrial sites and improve the work environment in terms of considering workers"" wellness."
Tathāgatagarbhaḥ sarvasattvānāṃ — 涅槃経における如来蔵の 複合語解釈にかんする試論—,2017,"['tathāgatagarbha', 'bahuvrīhi', 'Mahāparinirvāṇamahāsūtra', 'stūpa', '여래장', '소유복합어', '대반열반대경', '스투파']","이 논문에서, 나는 <<대승열반경>> (Mahāparinirvāṇamahāsūtra) 산스크리트 단편에 보존된 ‘tathāgatagarbhaḥ sarvasattvānāṃ’라는 선언문의 해석과 관련하여 가설을 제시하고자 한다. 즉, 이 구는 소유복합어(bahuvrīh)인 ‘tathāgatagarbha’가 ‘sattva’를 수식하는 (sarvasattvās tathāgatagarbhāḥ) <<여래장경>> (Tathāgatagarbhasūtra)의 경우와는 달리, 이 구가 소유복합어일 경우 ‘tathāgatagarbha’라는 단어가 문법적으로 ‘sattvānāṃ’을 수식할 수 없다는 것을 확인하고자한다. 선행연구들은 대부분 <<열반경>>의 ‘tathāgatagarbhaḥ’ 를 격한정복합어(tatpuruṣa)로 해석해왔지만, 나는 이 것을 소유복합어로 해석하고. 이 복합어가 어떤 기술되지 않은 명사(즉, 구절에서 생략된 stūpa)를 수식하는 형용사를 취한다고 주장하고자 한다. 이는 다음의 이유에 기반한다.(1) 선언문에서 단어‘tathāgatagarbha’는, 소유복합어로서 ‘tathāgatadhātugarbha’가 ‘stūpa’를 수식(즉, ‘여래의유물을가진stūpa’) 하는 다른 대승 경전에서 증명되듯이, ‘tathāgatadhātugarbhān stūpān, dhātugarbhe caitye’ (유물을 가진 caitya (sadhātuke caitye)라는표현으로 바꿔 말할 수도 있다.) 등과 같은 표현을전제할 것이다. (2) 이 선언문에서 불교 비문(碑文)의 ‘dhātudhṛk’ 나 ‘dhātudharaḥ’와 같은(둘 다stūpaḥ를 생략) 표현에서 발견되는 동일한 생략, 곧 명사 ‘stūpa’의 생략을 반영할 수 있을 것이다. (3) <<열반경>>의 선언문은 자연스럽게 (법신(dharmakāya)과 여래장(tathāgatagarbha)의 관점으로부터 <<열반경>>에서 재해석되는) 여래의 열반(tathāgata’s nirvāṇa)과 탑에 있는 그의 유물을 다루는 <<열반경>>의 주요 주제와 연결되어야 한다. (4) <<열반경>>은 모든 존재들은 실제 ‘stūpa/caitya’라고 정확히 선언하고, 이 선언은 “모든 존재들은 ‘tathāgatagarbha(즉, stūpa)’를 가진다(tathāgatagarbhaḥ sarvasattvānāṃ)”는 구와 맥락상 일치한다. (5) <<열반경>>의 산스크리트 구절에서 “우리 위에 tathāgatagarbha가 있다(asmākam upari tathāgatagarbho ‘sti)”에는 또 다른 해석이 있을수있다. 이 표현에서 단어‘tathāgatagarbha’는 위에 언급된 해석 과 위배되지 않고, 오히려 이 것은 <<법화경>>(Saddharmapuṇḍarīka)의 유명한 장면을 상기시킨다. 즉, 청중들 위 하늘로 올라오는 ‘stūpa’다(saptaratnamayaḥ stūpo ’bhyudgataḥ ... parṣanmaṇḍalasyopari vaihāyasaṃ tiṣṭhet).따라서, 나는 이 선언문 속에서 단어‘tathāgatagarbhaḥ’를 잠정적으로‘stūpa’ 를 수식하는 소유복합어로 해석할 것을 제안한다. 그러나, 나는 단어의 부차적인 의미로 ‘tathāgatagarbha’를 격한정복합어로 해설하는 것이 가능하다고 생각한다. 왜냐하면 시모다 마사히로나 미하일 라디치가 이미 지적하였듯이 ‘garbha’라는 단어의 의미가 풍부하기 때문에, 두세 가지의 의미로 단어를 사용할 수도 있기 때문이다.","In this paper, I shall propose a hypothetical interpretation of the phrase tathāgatagarbhaḥ sarvasattvānāṃ, which is a declarative formula of the Mahāparinirvāṇamahāsūtra (abbr. MPMS) and is preserved as original Sanskrit. This phrase confirms that the word tathāgatagarbha—if this is a bahuvrīhi compound—cannot grammatically go with the word sattvānāṃ unlike the case of the Tathāgatagarbhasūtra, in which tathāgatagarbha, being a bahuvrīhi, qualifies the noun sattva (sarvasattvās tathāgatagarbhāḥ). Previous studies have mostly interpreted tathāgatagarbhaḥ of the MPMS, as a tatpuruṣa, whereas I shall keep this as a bahuvrīhi and take it to be an adjective which qualifies some undescribed noun—that is, stūpa, omitted in the phrase, based on the following reasons: (1) The word tathāgatagarbha in the formula is probably premising such expressions like tathāgatadhātugarbhān stūpān, dhātugarbhe caitye (which is paraphrased by the expression sadhātuke caitye “a caitya that contains relics”), etc., as found in other Mahāyāna scriptures, where tathāgatadhātugarbha, as a bahuvrīhi, qualifies the noun stūpa “a stūpa that contains tathāgata's relics”; (2) the omission of the noun stūpa in the formula might reflect the same omission found in expressions, such as dhātudhṛk or dhātudharaḥ (both omitting stūpaḥ), as found in Buddhist inscriptions; (3) The declarative formula of the MPMS should naturally be relevant to the main topic of the MPMS, which deals with tathāgata's nirvāṇa and his relics that were found in stūpas (which, in turn, are reinterpreted in the MPMS from the viewpoint of the dharmakāya and tathāgatagarbha); (4) The MPMS precisely declares that all beings are real stūpa/caitya, and this declaration fits well with the phrase tathāgatagarbhaḥ sarvasattvānāṃ “all beings have tathāgatagarbha (i.e. stūpa)”; (5) We find yet another expression (asmākam upari tathāgatagarbho 'sti “there is tathāgatagarbha above us”) in the Sanskrit fragment of the MPMS; however, the word tathāgatagarbha, in this expression, does not disturb the above- mentioned interpretation. Instead, this reminds us of the famous scene taught in the Saddharmapuṇḍarīka—the stūpa arising in the sky above the audience: saptaratnamayaḥ stūpo ’bhyudgataḥ ... parṣanmaṇḍalasyopari vaihāyasaṃ tiṣṭhet. Accordingly, I shall tentatively propose to interpret the word tathāgatagarbhaḥ in the formula as a bahuvrīhi which qualifies the noun stūpa. I think, however, it is possible to apprehend tathāgatagarbha as a tatpuruṣa, to be the secondary meaning of the word because the MPMS most probably utilizes the word with double or triple meaning in order to preserve the semantic richness of the word garbha, which has already been pointed out by Masahiro Shimoda and Michael Radich."
Prevalence of Atrial Fibrillation in Korean Population,2017,"['Atrial Fibrillation', 'Epidemiology', 'Stroke', 'Oral Anticoagulation']",,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in clinical practice and has been a major public health problem. The prevalence of AF globally has been reported to range from 0.4% to 2% in the adult population; however, the prevalence widely varies depending on the study population. Although AF prevalence in Asian population is about 1% lower than that in European and North American population, the number of AF patients in Asia is rapidly increasing concomitant with the increased aging of the population. However, previous studies that reported AF epidemiology in the Korean population are limited. According to a recent report based on the national health claims database, prevalence of AF in 2015 was 0.7% in the entire Korean adult population and showed a continuous increase with population aging. Additionally, among patients with AF, mean CHA2DS2-VASc score was significantly increased and the number of high thromboembolic risk patients has increased over time. Although oral anticoagulation (OAC) prescription in AF patients increased from 35% to 51%, especially after introduction of non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants, a substantial proportion of Korean patients with AF still remain undertreated. In this review, we aimed to summarize temporal changes in the prevalence and incidence of AF and to evaluate the thromboembolic risk in patients with AF. In addition, we also discussed the utilization of OAC therapy in patients with AF in Korean population."

Above all asychronism of online communication supported by the technology has overcome the time and geological limitation, thus leads to the increase in the number of the disputes. However procedures such as litigations and ADR which need physical presence are deemed inappropriate to resolve the new types of disputes arising in the online context. Accordingly the role of online space and ODR have received attention as the alternative field to resolve and prevent the online disputes. Also the techincal feauture of ODR that ignores geologycal and phsical limitation has rendered it as a cheap and convinient means to resovle the offline disputes as well as the online disputes. In this regard it is argued that ODR can serve as a digital justice since it can substatially enhance the accessability to justice. In essence ODR can not only function as an optimal platform to resolve low-value-high-volume online disputes arising out of e-commerce, but also as the practical means to resolve disputes in countries in conflicts or in remote areas where parties can hardly have access to the dispute resolving body.This paper intends to introduce the new meaning of the access to justice in the digital era and the significance of the ODR as the future dispute resolution process and its impact on the acess to justice. Then the difference between the public ODR and the private ODR and their merits and drawbakcs will be analyzed respectively.

Medium-resolution Spectroscopy of Red Giant Branch Stars in<i>ω</i>Centauri,2017,,,"<P>We present [Fe/H] and [Ca/Fe] of similar to 600 red giant branch (RGB) members of the globular cluster Omega Centauri (omega Cen). We collect medium-resolution (R similar to 2000) spectra using the Blanco 4 m telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory equipped with Hydra, the fiber-fed multi-object spectrograph. We demonstrate that blending of stellar light in optical fibers severely limits the accuracy of spectroscopic parameters in the crowded central region of the cluster. When photometric temperatures are taken in the spectroscopic analysis, our kinematically selected cluster members, excluding those that are strongly affected by flux from neighboring stars, include relatively fewer stars at intermediate metallicity ([Fe/H] similar to -1.5) than seen in the previous high-resolution survey for brighter giants in Johnson & Pilachowski. As opposed to the trend of increasing [Ca/Fe] with [Fe/H] found by those authors, our [Ca/Fe] estimates, based on Ca II H & K measurements, show essentially the same mean [Ca/Fe] for most of the metal-poor and metal-intermediate populations in this cluster, suggesting that mass- or metallicity-dependent SN II yields may not be necessary in their proposed chemical evolution scenario. Metal-rich cluster members in our sample show a large spread in [Ca/Fe], and do not exhibit a clear bimodal distribution in [Ca/Fe]. We also do not find convincing evidence for a radial metallicity gradient among RGB stars in omega Cen.</P>"
The impact of body armor on physical performance of law enforcement personnel,2017,"['Officer', 'Police', 'Body armour', 'Personal protective equipment']",,"Background: The law enforcement officer profession requires performance of arduous occupational tasks while carrying an external load, consisting of, at minimum, a chest rig, a communication system, weaponry, handcuffs, personal protective equipment and a torch. The aim of this systematic review of the literature was to identify and critically appraise the methodological quality of published studies that have investigated the impacts of body armour on task performance and to synthesize and report key findings from these studies to inform law enforcement organizations.  Methods: Several literature databases (Medline, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, EMBAS) were searched using key search words and terms to identify appropriate studies. Studies meeting the inclusion criteria were critically evaluated using the Downs and Black protocol with inter-rater agreement determined by Cohen’s Kappa.  Results: Sixteen articles were retained for evaluation with a mean Downs and Black score of 73.2 ± 6.8% (k = 0.841). Based on the research quality and findings across the included studies, this review determined that while effects of body armour on marksmanship and physiological responses have not yet been adequately ascertained, body armour does have significant physical performance and biomechanical impacts on the wearer, including: a) increased ratings of perceived exertion and increased time to complete functional tasks, b) decreased work capability (indicated by deterioration in fitness test scores), c) decreased balance and stability, and d) increased ground reaction forces.  Conclusions: Given the physical performance and biomechanical impacts on the wearer, body armour should be carefully selected, with consideration of the physical fitness of the wearers and the degree to which the armour systems can be ergonomically optimized for the specific population in question."
인적자원개발과 평생교육의 개념적 관계에 대한 인적자원개발과 평생교육 연구자의 인식 유형과 상호지향성 분석,2017,"['human resource development', 'lifelong education', 'co-orientation model', 'Q methodology', 'concept analysis', '인적자원개발', '평생교육', '상호지향성 모형', 'Q방법론', '개념 분석']","이 연구의 목적은 인적자원개발과 평생교육 연구자가 인식하는 인적자원개발과 평생교육의 개념적 관계를 상호지향성 모형과 결합된 Q방법론을 활용해 분석하는 것이다. 30개의 진술문을 Q표본으로 하고 인적자원개발과 평생교육 분야의 연구자 총 18명의 P표본을 구성하여 분석한 결과를 다음과 같이 종합하였다. 첫째, 평생교육 연구자가 HRD 연구자보다 상대 분야 연구자의 개념적 관계에 대한 인식에 대해 더 높은 일치 정도를 보였지만, 평생교육 연구자 집단 내에서 일부 평생교육 연구자의 HRD와 평생교육의 개념적 관계는 ‘같음’ 보다는 ‘다름’ 위에 성립하는 것이라고 할 수 있다. 둘째, HRD 연구자들이 평생교육 연구자들보다 HRD와 평생교육의 개념적 관계를 바라보는 관점의 차이를 더 크게 인식하고 있다고 할 수 있다. 결론적으로 HRD와 평생교육의 개념적 관계는 HRD에서의 개인 대 조직의 관계를 어떻게 설정하느냐의 문제로 귀결될 수 있다. 또한 일터에서의 성인이 경험하는 학습의 의미에 대한 입장 차이가 HRD와 평생교육의 개념적 관계에 대한 입장 차이로 이어질 수 있다. 마지막으로 HRD와 평생교육의 개념적 관계에 있어서 일능력개발이 접점으로서의 가능성을 인정받은 것에 비해 HRD에 대한 비판적 접근은 국내 연구자들에게 충분히 인정받지 못했다. 후속 연구로는 HRD와 일능력개발 또는 직업교육훈련의 개념적 관계 분석, 미국과 영국을 포함한 해외 연구자들과의 비교 연구를 제안하였다.","The purpose of this study was to analyze the recognition types and co-orientation between HRD and lifelong education researchers about the conceptual relationship of HRD and lifelong education using Q methodology. For the purpose, Q sample was constructed of 30 statements and P sample was composed of 18 Korean researchers in HRD and lifelong education. Findings of the study were as follows; First, lifelong education researchers more accurately understood the conceptual relationship than those of HRD researchers did understand the conceptual relationship. Nevertheless, the perspective on the conceptual relationship of some of lifelong education researchers were based on ‘differences’ rather than ‘commonalities’ between two fields. Second, HRD researchers more deeply perceived there are differences between two fields than those of lifelong education researchers. In conclusion, the conceptual relationship of HRD and lifelong education are dependent on how to set the relationship between individual and organization. In addition, different perspectives on the meaning of leaning in workplace affect on differentiating the conceptual relationship between two fields. Lastly, workforce development was appreciated as the link between two fields while critical approach to HRD was not. For further research, analyzing the conceptual relationship among HRD, workforce development, vocational education and training, and international comparative research including researchers from U.S. and U.K. were suggested."

The lineage became the most prominent family of Kimsan, after it produced Yi Yak-tong (李約東) (1416-1493), Yi’s Chon-sil’s grandson. After settling in Kimsan, the lineages started to move away from the home village, Haro and migrated to Ch’ŏnha-myŏn and Kusoyo-myŏn, north of Kimsan, in the late 15th –the early 16th century, to south and west of Kimsan, in the early and mid-17th century and to the rugged mountain terrain around Mt.

Sŏngsan Yŏs were the most influential one, followed by Ch’angnyŏng Chos, Yŏnil Chŏngs, and Chinju Kangs. Among them, Sŏngsan Yŏs and Chinju Kangs belonged to the Southerners faction, with the rest being affiliated with the Westerners (Old Doctrine) faction. This means that Kimsan was dominated by the lineages affiliated with the Westerners faction, a feature quite different from northern Kyŏngsang-do, north of Taegu, where the Southerners had dominant power.

Psychological effects of a disastrous hydrogen fluoride spillage on the local community,2017,"['Hydrogen fluoride', 'Disaster', 'Psychological effect']",,"Background: On September 27, 2012, at 3:43 pm, a hydrogen fluoride spill occurred in a manufacturing plant located at the 4th complex of the Gumi National Industrial Complex in Gumi City, South Korea. The present study aimed to evaluate the psychological effects of the hydrogen fluoride spill on the members of the community and to investigate their relationships with physical symptoms and changes in psychological effects occurring as time passed after the accident.  Methods: The 1st phase involved a survey of 1359 individuals that was conducted 1 month after the spill, and the 2nd phase involved a survey of 711 individuals that was conducted 7 months after the accident. The questionnaires included items for assessing demographic characteristics, hydrogen fluoride exposure level, physical symptoms, and psychological status. Physical symptoms were assessed to determine the persistence of irritations. Psychological status was assessed to investigate the impact of event level using the Impact of Event Scale – Revised Korean version (IES-R-K), and the anxiety level was assessed using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI).  Results: As the hydrogen fluoride exposure level increased, the impact of event and anxiety levels increased significantly both 1 and 7 months after the accident (p < 0.05). The mean score of the impact of event levels decreased significantly from 33.33 ± 14.64 at 1 month after the accident to 28.68 ± 11.80 at 7 months after the accident (p < 0.05). The mean score of the anxiety levels increased significantly from 5.16 ± 6.59 at 1 month after the accident to 6.79 ± 8.41 at 7 months after the accident (p < 0.05). The risk of persistent physical symptoms at 7 months after the accident was significantly higher in females. The risk of persistent physical symptoms also increased significantly, with increasing age, hydrogen fluoride exposure, and impact of event levels (p < 0.05).  Conclusions: The present study found that the impact of event level and anxiety level increased with increasing hydrogen fluoride exposure. Anxiety levels persisted even after time passed. The risk of persistent physical symptoms at 7 months after the accident was higher in females, and it increased with increasing age, hydrogen fluoride exposure level, and impact of event levels."
The isothermal-fluidic field of a secondary moderator jet in a ¼ scale CANDU-6 reactor model,2017,"['CANDU', 'Fluidic similarity', 'Moderator circulation', 'Reynolds number independence', 'Secondary jet', 'MCT']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>The steady, isothermal-fluidic field of forced moderator streams in a ¼ scaled moderator circulation tank (MCT) of a CANDU-6 reactor is analysed. Particular focus is placed on characterizing a secondary jet formed by the collision of symmetric, counter flowing wall jets discharged upwards by nozzles installed at each side of the MCT’s horizontal axis. Two separate sets of experiments have been conducted employing water and air as the working fluids with different nozzle configurations (i.e., discrete dove-tail nozzles for water and two-dimensional slot jet nozzles for air). Then, cross validation of the fluidic data sets from these two different test facilities have been made where the fluidic similarity of the secondary jet generated by the inlet nozzles (particularly its rate of dissipation as it interacts with the calandria tubes (CTs)) has been established. Based on the established fluidic similarity, a series of numerical simulations have been performed according to the boundary conditions obtained extensively from the two-dimensional MCT experiments. Subsequently, the numerical results have been validated against the experimental data to assess the capability of a commercial code (ANSYS CFX V15.0) to resolve the moderator interaction with the CTs. It has been demonstrated that a monotonic decay of the secondary jet whose peak (having roughly 50% of the nozzle’s exit mean vertical velocity component) exists at the throat of the first row of the calandria tubes in the MCT takes place. After which, the momentum of the secondary jet is substantially reduced along its centreline. The rate of dissipation of the secondary jet is under-predicted by the default <I>k-ω</I> SST turbulence model, leading to a dramatic over-prediction of the penetration distance of the secondary jet into the core region. However, the accuracy of the numerical results can be substantially improved with turbulence model parameter tuning to achieve a closer fit with the reference experimental data.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  There exist secondary jet Reynolds number independence and fluidic similarity. </LI> <LI>  Secondary jet peaks roughly at 50% of the nozzle’s exit means vertical velocity. </LI> <LI>  The momentum of the secondary jet is substantially reduced along its centreline. </LI> <LI>  The rate of dissipation of the secondary jet is under-predicted by the default <I>k-ω</I> SST turbulence model. </LI> <LI>  The accuracy of the numerical results can be improved with turbulence model parameter tuning. </LI> </UL> </P>"

B. subtilis E9-1가 생산하는 박테리오신의 물리화학적 특성을 조사하였고, 박테리오신을 정제하였다. 이 박테리오신은 B. cereus KCCM 11204, M. luteus IAM 1056, L. monocytogenes KCCM 40307, E. faecium KCCM 12118 및 S. aureus subsp. aureus KCCM 40050 등에 대해서 항균활성을 나타내었다. pH 2.0~8.0 범위에서는 안정하였으나 8.0 이상에서는 항균활성이 감소하였다. Isopropanol, ethanol 및 methanol 등의 유기용매에서 100%까지, acetone과 acetonitrile에서는 80%까지 항균활성을 유지하였다. 내열성의 경우 40~100℃에서 60분까지는 안정하게 항균활성을 보였다. 박테리오신 농도를 증가시키면서 B. cereus, L. monocytogenes, E. faecium 및 S. aureus subsp. aureus 등 시험균 4주의 감수성을 조사한 결과 농도 의존적으로 시험균의 생육이 감소하였고 이중 L. monocytogenes 의 감수성이 가장 높게 나타났다. 박테리오신의 작용양상을 알아본 결과 B. cereus와 L. monocytogenes 배양액에 박테리오신 용액을 첨가한 후 흡광도와 CFU값이 감소하여 bactericidal임을 확인하였다. 식품에 적용 가능성을 알아보기 위해 실험한 결과 3일째부터 박테리오신을 처리하지 않은 대조구에 비해 실험구에서 생균수(CFU/ml)가 감소하였다. 아세톤을 이용한 배양상등액의 농축, superdex peptide HR 10/300 column 이용한 겔여과크로마토그래피, 역상 HPLC로써 박테리오신을 정제하였다. 역상 HPLC를 통해서 정제한 박테리오신의 분자량을 tricine SDS- PAGE로 분석한 결과 약 4 kDa이었고 질량분석법으로 측정한 정확한 분자량은 3347.6 Da로 나타났다.","As an effort to find a potential biopreservative, we isolated bacterial strains producing bacteriocin from fermented foods. A strain was finally selected and characteristics of the bacteriocin were investigated. The selected strain was identified as Bacillus subtilis E9-1 based on the 16S rRNA gene analysis. The culture supernatant of B. subtilis E9-1 showed antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Subtilisin A, α-chymotrypsin, trypsin and proteinase K inactivated the antimicrobial activity, which means its proteinaceous nature, a bacteriocin. The bacteriocin activity was fully retained at the pH range from 2.0 to 8.0 and stable at up to 100℃ for 60 min. Solvents such as ethanol, isopropanol and methanol had no effect on the antimicrobial activity at the concentration of 100% but acetone and acetonitrile reduced the activity at up to 100% concentration. Cell growth of four indicator strains was dramatically decreased in dose-dependent manner. Listeria monocytogenes was the most sensitive, but Enterococcus faecium was the most resistant. Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus showed the medium sensitivity. The bacteriocin showed its antimicrobial activity against B. cereus and L. monocytogenes via bactericidal action. The number of viable cells of L. monocytogenes started to reduce after addition of bacteriocin to the minced beef. The bacteriocin was purified through acetone concentration, gel filtration chromatography and RP-HPLC. The whole purification step led to a 6.82 fold increase in the specific activity and 6% yield of bacteriocin activity. The molecular weight of the purified bacteriocin was determined to be 3.3 kDa by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry."

Even basic reading of is hard but it is certain that this work deals with one figure(Lee Sang)’s one day off. This whole day for 24 hours consists of trivial events just like most modern men's daily life. Lee Sang's one day described a bit pointlessly in is mainly made up of images and thoughts aroused by media, and those aroused by stroll(散步). What particularly catches eyes in the work is the sentences inserted without context, such as written colloquial Chinese, French, English and other foreign languages. Before and after these 7 sentences in total in foreign languages, diverse thoughts are developed, Among them, five written colloquial Chinese sentences deal with the circumstances of those times and Lee Sang's understanding of and reactions to them, and other 2 sentences in western languages, that is, French and English, have cultural contents. In other words, Lee Sang is learning about the time and experiencing the world through the media of books, magazines or movies in his daily life. In addition to reading and thinking, Lee Sang's most important activity is walking in the city. Only sense of sight is emphasized to modern men, and they have been deprived of experiences. In this respect, the two ways how Lee Sang experiences the world are severely modern and they are a modern man's experience of the world. Full experience is impossible in the first place, and experiences exist just as fragmented parts, so the representation of the world which cannot but be created through ‘myself’, that is, language, cannot be flawless. Smoothly elaborated language actually deletes beings or events, so the crunching and uncomfortable language in delivers the essence of the world most faithfully in some sense. In , he(Lee Sang, E. teacher Lee Sang with responsibility and duty, K) is expressed in diverse forms. Lee Sang's division, who is splitted into two or three, exposes contradiction of a modern subject itself that actually cannot be a single one. In this division that rejects a clear main agent, hatred and refusal against the life lasting with no meaning are also inherent. Lee Sang is myself of 'trace' that is erased while being written. To this Lee Sang, his way to escape is art. 'Darkroom of the map’ is dark himself(box 箱) on the map of the meaningless world, and a darkroom where it is possible to read a map because it's dark, and therefore where a map can be estimated and felt."

Direct Perception(pratyakṣa), the origin of three right means of recognition in Classical Sāṃkhya and Yoga schools expands from the pure sense organ-perception(indriya-pratyakṣa) to the pretersensual Yogi’s perception(prāptiba or yogi-pratyakṣa). The present writer attempted to find the Epistemological characteristics of Classical Sāṃkhya and Yoga only through the magnifying glass of perception(pratyakṣa). As a result, it was found that the two schools had different characteristics in many ways. The findings are as follows. First, after classifying the organs(indriya) related to perception in Classical Sāṃkhya in detail, it was found that Classical Sāṃkhya emphasized the role of Buddhi(intelligence), whereas Classical Yoga integrated the internal organs into ‘citta’(mind) and discussed its action and how to control it. Second, Classical Sāṃkhya explained about the occurrence of perception through contact with sense organ and object, traditional methods, whereas Classical Yoga expressed the reflection of citta through comparison of ‘quartz’to ‘magnet and iron.’Third, Classical Sāṃkhya wasn’t clear about self-perception in Vijñānavādin, whereas Classical Yoga refused the self-perception(Svasaṁvedana) clearly, thus aiming at Anākārajñānavāda. Finally, taken the views from the two schools on definition and characteristics of perception together, it can be classified into sense organ-perception, determination-perception and Yogi’s perception. As this study is just an attempt to identify the Epistemology in the two schools, further researches need to conduct a close study by expanding the scope of study into the entire Epistemology in the future. Nevertheless, it is still hoped that the present writer’s attempt can be of help for people to take interest in epistemological views from the two schools."

Candrakīrti borrows authority from sūtras (āgamādhigama), one of the orthodox styles of argumentation, to interpret ‘cittamātra’ in Daśabhūmikasūtra. In his criticism, by quoting sūtras, Candrakīrti did not read the meaning of the cittamātra in the Daśabhūmikasūtra as the vijñapti-mātra, the negation of the external object. Bhāviveka points out through the twelve links of interdependent origination (dvādaśāuga-pratītyasamutpāda) that the cittamātra is not for the negation of the external object. Candrakīrti does not exhaustively verify the contextual meaning of the three-fold world as cittamātra in the Daśabhūmikasūtra and instead explains that the condition of the Vijñāna is the causality through a natural sequence (anulomākāra) and reverse sequence (pratilomākāra) as in the Daśabhūmikasūtra. He denies the actor as the immortal ātman through the principle of the twelve links of interdependent origination and argues that we can know the cittamātra as the actor only in language, but not in reality, in ‘Advancing’ in the Madhyamakāvatāra."

Shu Jing書經, Classic of History, also just abbreviated to ‘Shu書’, pronounced ‘Seo書’ in Korean) in early Chosun(朝鮮) period are Kwon Geun(權近)’s Seo Cheongyeonnok(書淺見錄, Superficial Reflections on Shu Jing) and Yi Hwang(李滉)’s Seo Seoki(書釋義, Commentary on Shu Jing). These two books were written to interpret Shang Shu on the basis of explanatory notes of Shu Ji Zhuan(書集傳, A Collection of Comments on the Shu) by Cai Chen(蔡沈) who was one of Zhu Xi(朱熹)'s eminent disciples. The interpretation of Shang Shu on the basis of Shu Ji Zhuan should be preceded by examining and analyzing Shu Ji Zhuan per se. Kim Jangsaeng(金長生)’s Interpretation of Shang Shu was inherited from the previous achievements of Shang Shu interpretation of early Chosun period represented by Kwon Geun and Yi Hwang, and also written for the purpose of supplemented and intensified examination of Cai Chen’s commentary on Shu Jing. Kim Jangsaeng’s Gyeongseo Byeoni on Shu Ji Zhuan(經書辨疑-書傳, The Examination of divergent passages in Chinese Classics - On Cai Chen’s Collection of Comments on the Shu) has 104 articles in total out of which 82 articles are on the subject of Cai Chen’s Shu Ji Zhuan, and mainly deals with the problems in Shu Ji Zhuan such as Controversy over Jinwen(今文: current script in Han Dynasty) and Guwen(古文: ancient script) texts, the reliability of forewords to each chapters of Shang Shu called Shuxu(書序), the problem of first 28 characters in Shun Dian(舜典, Canon of Shun, the second chapter of Shang Shu), and historical research on geographic themes. These topics were also main issues in Cai’s Shu Ji Zhuan, which shows Kim intended to supplement and rectify Cai’s deficiencies and faults. In the course of closer examination, Kim had recognized the inaccuracy of Cai’s Shu Ji Zhuan,, which drove him to suggest the alternative commentaries. This can be regarded as his own line of interpretation of Shang Shu in Chosun dynasty when Cai’s interpretation had great influence in Shang Shu study. It is also noteworthy that Kim adopted the interpretations of commentaries of Chosun dynasty’s preceding scholars such as Kwon Geun, Yi Hwang, or Yi I(李珥) and comtemporary scholars such as Sin Heum(申欽), Im Sukyeong(任叔英), Jeong Hongmyeong(鄭弘溟), and that Kim’s commentary had influenced to Kim Jongjeong(金鍾正)’s interpretation of Shang Shu who lived in 18th century’s Chosun dynasty, the era of King Yeonjo(英祖) and Jeongjo(正祖). Kim Jangsaeng’s Gyeongseo Byeoni inherited the preceding interpretation of Shang Shu in early Chosun period such as Kwon Geun’s or Yi Hwang’s, which intensified and deepened the understanding of Cai Chen’s interpretation of Shang Shu, and also accepted positively his comtemporary scholars’ view such as Sin Heum, Im Sukyeong, and Jeong Hongmyeong, which means that he propose the alternative of Cai’s interpretation. Kim Jangsaeng’s interpretion and commentary of Shang Shu can be evaluated as the bridge to later Chosun dynasty’s own line of Shang Shu interpretation."

Literatures of first are YogaSūtra, Sāṁkhya-Kārikā, Haṭhapradīpikā, Śiva-Saṁhitā, GheraņḍaSaṁhitā. Those of second are Śāṇḍilya bhakti sūtra, Nārada bhakti sūtra Yogayājñavalkya Saṁhitā. Patañjali, a redactor of Yoga-Sūtra assessed as familiar with the yoga scholar rather than is a respectable ācārya/guru, but Īśvarakṛṣņa, author of Sāṁkhya-Kārikāsucceed the traditional view of Upaniṣdic ācārya. The Śiva-Saṁhitāamong post-yoga’s literatures notice that specify the right of the disciples and a respect for one’s ācārya.Though the author of three post-yoga literatures exist those names, these is estimated at another persons.

Samples of PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and also soil, were collected in several areas during the year of 2012 to investigate elemental composition. A URG cyclone sampler was used for collection. The samples were collected according to each experimental condition, and the analysis method of SEM-EDX was used to determine the concentration of each metallic element. The comparative analysis indicated that their mass concentration ranged from 1% to 3%. The elements in the industrial region that were above 10% were Si, Al, Fe, and Ca. Those below 5% were Na, Mg, and S. The remaining elements (1% of total mass) consisted of elements such as Ni, Co, Br and Pb. Finally, a statistical tool was applied to the elemental results to identify each source for the industrial region. From a principal components analysis (SPSS, Ver 20.0) performed to analyze the possible sources of PM10 in the industrial region, five main factors were determined. Factor 1 (Si, Al), which accounted for 15.8% of the total variance, was mostly affected by soil and dust from manufacturing facilities nearby, Factors 2 (Cu, Ni), 3 (Zn, Pb), and 4 (Mn, Fe), which also accounted for some of variance, were mainly related to iron, non-ferrous metals, and other industrial manufacturing sources. Also, five factors determined to access possible sources of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, Factor 1 (Na, S), accounted for 13.5% of the total variance and was affected by sea-salt particles and fuel incineration sources, and Factors 2 (Ti, Mn), 3 (Pb, Cl), 4 (K, Al) also explained significant proportions of the variance. Theses factors mean that the PM2.5 emission sources may be considered as sources of incineration, and metals, and non-ferrous manufacturing industries."

This DMT program was conducted for total 10 times, once or twice a week for 45 minutes from April 4th to May 16th in 2017. EES which Kring(1994) had developed and later on translated and revised by Han Jungwon(1997), RCS which Schelin(1977) had developed and later on translated and revised by Moon Sunmo(1980). All of these were used as a means of evaluating emotional expressivity and relationship of older adults with mild dementia before and after the experiment. It consisted of three stages; early stage, middle stage and last stage. Each therapy consist of warm-up, theme-development and closure. For warm-up and closure of each therapy program, based on the repetition of movement emphasizing circle structure, it reduces the subjects anxiety and help them feel comfortable. Along with this basic frame, in early stage, the subjects were encouraged to aware physical body by exploring their bodies. And they perceived the circle structure. After that, they were encouraged to communicate with others using their mirroring, cooperative movement and circular props. For the last stage, they express their emotion each other with physical contact and dance. The each therapy of the whole program utilize Marian chace’s circle structure and the beginning and closure parts had repeating movements. As a result of the experiment and the statistical significance test, it was proven that DMT using Marian chace’s circle structure had meaningful effects on increasing emotional expressivity and relationship of older adults with mild dementia. It encouraged the older adults with mild dementia who were suffered in living with others in day care centers to aware body, repeat the movement in the circle structure and contact with others to have positive effects on emotional expressivity and relationship."

Field experiments were conducted at five citrus orchards by altitude from Sep. 2015 to Apr. 2016 in Jeju Island, Republic of Korea. Hairy vetch used in the study was ‘Cheongpyungbora’, developed by National Institute of Crop Science. Seeding rates of hairy vetch consisted of 30, 60 and 90 kg ․ ha-1. Results showed that the seedling establishment rates of hairy vetch were quite similar regardless of seeding rates in all fields and weed occurrence ratio at 30, 60 and 90 kg ․ ha-1 of seeding rates were 11.8, 3.8, and 5.1% (dry wt.), respectively.

Aber wie können wir die praktische Bedeutung seiner Verhaltenslehre finden? In den meisten Geschichten im Buch der Wendungen, das Brecht selbst als das Büchlein mit Verhaltenslehren nennt, wird das Moment der Wendung auf verschiedene Weise präsentiert. Brecht versucht damit, seinem Leser ein dialektisches Denken zu vermitteln, das er als eine Voraussetzung für die Erkenntnis der Wirklichkeit und deren Veränderung betrachtet. In diesem Sinne kann man sagen, dass die meisten Geschichten im Buch der Wendungen zur Kategorie der Verhaltenslehre gehören.Wir leben in einer Zeit der ‘unendlichen Konkurrenz’, in der die Logik von Kapital und Markt alle Lebensbereiche dominiert. In dieser Situation leben wir ein weitgehend entfremdetes Leben. Die Stereotypen und Vorurteile, die uns prägen, hindern uns, die Wirklichkeit unseres Alltags richtig wahrzunehmen.

Broadly speaking, all the justices can be concluded into ‘fairness.’ But to focus on the “justice” in the poetry of Le Guin, this paper categorizes justice into three types; “Social Justice,” “Environmental Justice,” and “Ecological Justice.” For the social justice, the first step Le Guin takes is the diagnosis of the injustices widespread in the modern society. She points out “the mis-recognition” of the weak and the low by the established who have monopolized knowledge and information also. The structural injustice in our society is more expanding and deepening in the “environmental justice.” All the environmental injustices, Le Guin believes, come from the environmental inequality and the inequality from the ignorance and insensibility of the established to the weak. In her poems “distance” and “other place or elsewhere” are the metaphor for the ignorance and insensibility. “Ecological justice,” the last and complete justice, is to be ‘oneness’ with everything fulfilled by the removing of the ignorance and insensibility. And in her poetry, all the justices are arranged into the ecological justice.   As a poet, Le Guin claims to be “a world’s housekeeper.” And her house which knows no inequality nor injustice at all is wide open to every direction and every one and every thing under the heaven. As a result, in Le Guin’s poetry, justice has the exactly same meaning with the ‘open consciousness’ toward everything in Nature for ‘symbiosis.’"
예브게니야 긴즈부르크의 『고난의 여정』과 코르네이 추코프스키의 『큰 벌레바퀴』의 간텍스트성 연구,2017,"['Ginzburg', 'Krutoj marshrut', 'Chukovsky', 'Cockroach', 'Intertextuality', '긴즈부르크', '『고난의 여정』', '추코프스키', '『큰 벌레바퀴』', '간텍스트성']",,"Intertextuality between Ginzburg’s Krutoj marshrut and Chukovsky’s Cockroach becomes naturally evident by Ginzburg’s direct citing Chukovsky’s text. Ginzburg reads Chukovsky’s text in a meeting with friends at her home. Both texts acquire new meanings thanks to the aesthetic functions of intertextuality, whereas each texts as separate ones could not have the same significances. According to the general evaluation the cockroach with mustache in Chukovsky’s text cannot be a caricature of Stalin, for Stalin was not a politically prominent figure at the time when this text was written. But the cockroach with mustache is nothing but the Stalin’s double within the context of intertextuality between the two texts. The fact that animals are eating each others under the presure of fear created by the cockroach with mustache in Chukovsky’s text is overlapping in Ginzburg’s text as multilineal betrayals among Soviet citizens disclosing not committed crimes. The cockroach’s intention to eat other animals’ children for suffer is a direct allegory to the children’s death of hunger and cold in Kolyma, including Ginzburg’s elder son Alesha. Ordinary animals’ curse of the cockroach is an echo of Soviet citizens’ abhorrence to Stalin which is possible owing to the aesthetic functions of intertextuality."
헤세의 『싯다르타』에 나타난 노자의 무위사상과 그 현대적 의미,2017,"['Laotse', 'Nichtstun', 'jenseits und diesseits', 'servant leadership', 'Koexistenz von Sein und Nichtsein', 'Einheit', '노자', '무위', '거피취차', '섬기는 지도자', '유무상생', '단일성', 'Lao-tzu', 'Wu-Wei', 'nature', 'servant leadership', ""coexistence of 'to be' and 'not to be'"", 'united harmony']",,"Laotses Nichtstun stellt eine konkrete Methode dar, das Tao zu verwirklichen, d.h. den naturgemäßen Weg zu gehen. Drei vorbildliche Muster dafür stellt Hesse in den Figuren Siddhartha und Vasudeva, sowie in dem Dingsymbol „Fluss‟ dar. Erstens: Wie der Berufene das andere entfernt und dieses nimmt, so widmet Siddhartha sich dem lebendigen Erleben in der sinnlichen Welt, das aber ein notwendiger Weg zum Erwachen ist, während Govinda seinen Weg nur in der Geisteswelt verfolgt. Zweitens: Wie sich der Berufene nicht selber hervortut, so wird er erhoben. Auf diese Weise dient der Fährmann Vasudeva allen Menschen und ist immer bescheiden, ebenso wie der Fluss abwärts fließt. Zugleich führt er seinen Gehilfen Siddhartha mit einer wortlosen Lehre. Und dank des fließenden Flusses, der den taoistischen Ursymbol für die polare Einheit alles Lebens bedeutet, ist auch Siddhartha wie Vasudeva klar geworden, dass Sein und Nichtsein einander erzeugen. Das Lächeln von Siddhartha strahlt die Heiterkeit als das Symbol für die Vollendung des Lebens aus. Es wäre wünschenswert, wenn Laotses Nichtstun, das Hesse in Siddhartha darstellt, auch auf unsere gegenwärtige Gesellschaft angewendet werden könnte."
Meaning in life among Korean college students based on emotionality and tolerance of uncertainty,2017,"['Meaning in life', 'Search for meaning', 'Presence of meaning', 'Korean', 'Self-cultivation']",,"This study examines different associations between the search for meaning in life (MLQ-S) and the presence of meaning in life (MLQ-P) based on sub-groups of emotionality and tolerance of uncertainty, respectively. Korean college student participants' self-reported survey responses were used in the study (N=348; 64.8% female; M<SUB>Age</SUB>=21.6years old). The results indicated that MLQ-S is positively correlated with MLQ-P in all levels of emotionality groups (Low, Average, and High emotionality) and the Average uncertainty tolerance group. Findings also suggested that MLQ-S was higher in Low emotionality than High emotionality; and MLQ-S was higher in the High uncertainty tolerance group than Low and Average uncertainty tolerance groups. The High uncertainty tolerance group reported the highest MLQ-P, and the Low uncertainty tolerance group reported the lowest MLQ-P. Findings highlight the importance of emotional stability and moderate levels of uncertainty tolerance in intervening clients' meaning seeking and meaning finding processes."
Prediction of entrained droplet fraction in co-current annular gas-liquid flow in vertical pipes,2017,"['Sauter mean diameter', 'Wire Mesh Sensor', 'Droplet entrainment', 'Large diameter pipes', 'Two-phase flow']",,"<P>The entrained droplet fraction is an important parameter in annular two-phase flow, as its correlations are key inputs in flow simulation codes for the prediction of pressure drop and critical heat flux or dryout. Investigators have stressed the importance of extending the validity range of current correlations so that more conditions are covered. This could be achieved for example by including fluids with higher viscosities, a wider range of operating pressures, and increase in the size of pipes used for experiments (most of the data in the literature are from pipes of 50 mm diameter and below). In attempt to improve the latter, experiments were conducted in a 101.6 mm gas liquid flow loop at Cranfield University's Oil and Gas Engineering Laboratory and data on the fraction of droplets were collected in the annular flow regime by measuring the film velocity, from which the droplet fraction was calculated. Comparison of the film velocity by this method and by a mass balance showed close agreement. A capacitance Wire Mesh Sensor was used for flow visualisation in order to distinguish between annular and churn flow. In order to arrive at an improved correlation, over 1300 data points were gathered from other published works. These include air water studies where large pipes of up to 127 mm in diameter were used. The others were from small-diameter pipes and for refrigerant, steam water, air water, and air glycerine flows. Since in the annular regime, the gas flow entrains liquid droplets into the core, their presence alters the properties of the gas core. Therefore, accurate predictions are pivotal for the energy efficient design and operation of facilities in the petroleum and nuclear power industry. The correlation obtained here showed good agreement with the collected databank. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</P>"

원효의 정토사상에서 慧와 信의 의미 ‒ 「무량수경종요」를 중심으로 ‒,2017,"['淨土', '慧', '信', '信解', '一心', 'Pure-land', 'prajñā', 'śraddhā', 'adhimukti', 'One-mind']","원효의 정토사상은 一心, 不二의 사상을 바탕으로 하고 있다. 따라서 그의 정토사상은 下化衆生이 곧 歸一心源임을 보여주고 있다.『무량수경종요』에 따르면 정토는 諸佛의 입장에서는 自受容土이지만, 범부의 입장에서는 여래의 본원력에 의지하기 때문에 他受容土이다. 그러한 정토는 果報土이고 『대승기신론』에서 말하는 三大(體 相 用) 중 用에 해당한다. 정토는 諸佛과 菩薩의 지혜에 의해 성취될 수 있지만, 범부 또한 信과 慧가 있어야 정토에 往生할 수 있다. 정토 往生의 因인 信(śraddhā)을 바탕으로 信解/ 勝解(adhimukti)가 낳아지고, 信解를 통해 忍辱이 가능해진다. 이 과정에서 즐거움과 괴로움이 교차하며 慧와 信은 계속해서 상호 작용한다. 이러한 과정은 『대승기신론』에서 말하는 6바라밀의 과정과도 상응한다. 이러한 상응은 원효의 정토사상이 『대승기신론』에 나타나는 여래장, 一心 사상을 바탕으로 하고 있음을 보여준다. 有漏慧로부터 無漏慧에 이르는 과정에서 혜에도 여러 단계가 있지만, 信 즉 마음의 청정이 없이는 무루혜에 도달할 수 없다. 하지만 보살의 정토는 중생이없이는 가능하지 않기에 무루이지만 유루이기도 하고, 유루이면서 무루이기도 하다. 이처럼 정토는 제불과 보살과 범부가 함께 만드는 것이다.","Wonhyo’s thoughts on the Pure Land is based on one-mind (一心). Therefore, his thoughts on the Pure Land tells us that ‘enlightenment’ is simply returning to our original state of the one-mind. According to Wonhyo, Buddha attained the Pure Land on his own, but ordinary people attain it through the power of prajñā and hope by Buddha. These ‘Pure Lands of the people’ are reward-lands and correspond to ‘usage’ in the three greatnesses (substance, appearance, usage) that are presented in the Awakening of Faith . The Pure Land is accomplished with prajñā by Buddha or Boddhisattva, and we can go to the Pure Land with praj ñā and śraddh ā . Śraddhā bears adhimukti , through which it is able to rise to the level of k ṣanti, and viṛya, dhy āna-p āramit ā . In this process, one encounters both pain and pleasure, but praj ñā and śraddh ā interact constantly. This process corresponds to the six p āramit ās presented in the Awakening of Faith . Prajñā has a few steps in the process from the ‘āsrava-jñāna’ to the ‘ an āsrava-j ñā na ’. Without śraddh ā (pureness of mind), the state of the ‘ an āsrava-j ñā na ’ is unattainable. However, the Pure Land of Boddhisattva cannot exist without people. Therefore, it both has kle śa and lacks it at the same time. Thus the Pure land is made by Buddha, Boddhisattva, people together."

HisJeokbyeokbujipja Gakchesasipsu was understood in the contexts of trends in the political situations of Joseon in the 17th century and Lee s alternative responses to the political situations. In the 17th century, the dynamic relations of the political power developed in complicated ways around the royal authority. Lee got along and discussed current events with Sambok, a son of Inpyeongdaegun, and left N ak do n gc han g s u r o k . The Seoins raised Gyeongshinhwanguk, citing these activities as an excuse. Once they seized power, the ones on their opposite side were banished to Buryeong, Cheongam, and other places. Lee accepted and reproduced The Battle of the Red Cliff by Su Shi as a way of escaping his suffering. Lee s Jeokbyeokbujipja Gakchesasipsu consists of four Yulsis in 7 Eon, six Yulsis in 5 Eon, ten Jeolgus in 7 and 5 Eon, each, and ten Gosis in 5 Eon, totaling in 1,344 letters. Its organization is in four layers with the semantic paragraphs grouped in ten Yulsis in 7 and 5 Eon, ten Jeonggus in 7 Eon, ten Jeolgus in 5 Eon, and ten Gosis. In terms of expression and content, it shows similar patterns to The Battle of the Red Cliff in the contrast of  Su Shi  and  Lee Seo-woo  and  Red Cliff  and  Blue Rock.  Jeokbyeokbujipja Gakchesasipsu depicts the true nature of Lee s hardship in the political situations of Joseon in the 17th century and his journey of desire as a man to overcome the hardship. His psychology evolves in the process of ① recognizing the reality, ② internalizing it, ③ replacing it with something else, and④ sublimating it. His mental states are replaced and represented by  Su Shi,   Red Cliff,   Seonyu,   Taoist hermit with miraculous powers,   beautiful women,   wings  and  the south,  which appear clear in the contrast of  Su Shi  and  Lee Seo-woo,   Red Cliff  in Hwangju and  Blue Wall  in Cheongam,   Taoist hermit with miraculous powers  and  human being  and  south  and  east.  In Jeokbyeokbujipja Gakchesasipsu, Hanyang is established in a sign system opposite to Cheongam set as a world of Taoist hermits with miraculous powers. Lee has such a yearning for returning back to Hanyang by escaping Cheongam at the northern tip of the country and imagines a world of Taoist hermits with miraculous powers on the way to Hanyang or a medium space via Su Shi and the Red Cliff. Hanyang is the place where his ideal of ego lies, and he longs for Hanyang and the world of Taoist hermits with miraculous powers to emerge as an ideal ego. His psychological changes can be understood in a process of activating his self-defense mechanism. That is, it is his psychological action to erase the negative reality by yearning for, recalling, and internalizing Su Shi, replace his spiritual pain before his eyes, and turn it into positive life energy. The patterns of constructing and dissolving the spatial sign system in his Jeokbyeokbujipja Gakchesasipsu imply such desire of his in a consistent manner."

2016년 코리아가든쇼 작가정원의 식물 의미에 관한 연구,2017,,,"This study was performed to determine what the plant material were selected to reflect in the 2016 Korea Garden Show designer's garden. It was analyzed that plant material was used to display the theme of the garden and to create a specific space. Under the given theme of 'K-Garden, Shinhallyu Garden(new style garden culture) with the most Korean taste', the plants were used to highlight the theme in two types: 'representation' and 'expression'. There were two 'representation' gardens that imitate a particular space of Korean taste and four 'expression' gardens that showcase the designer's thoughts with abstract concepts and concrete objects. Three gardens included both types of garden. The way of revealing the subject with plants was used more for 'expression' than for 'representation'. There were eleven spaces for 'representation' of the Korean taste, a vegetable garden, faucet, pond, field, nature, a Hanok court garden, groves of bamboo, tile roof, stone wall, rock and backyard of a Hanok connected to the mountain. The planting material was used in two ways: reflecting only the ecological characteristics of the plant, and considering the ecological and visual characteristics together. Vegetation plantings reflecting the ecological characteristics were observed in all eleven spaces. Nine of the spaces reflected the growth environment of the plants, but the other two did not reflect the ecological characteristics of the plants, unlike the designer's intention. In the case of the four spaces that considered the ecological and visual characteristics together, color and size were considered visual characteristics. The plants in the seven spaces that included 'expression' as the theme were selected to reflect the visual characteristics in the order of color, shape, texture, and size, rather than reflecting ecological characteristics. A group planting method was applied. When the plants were used as materials for creating space, Norman(1989) analyzed three enclosure factors(overhead, vertical, ground plane). Only two deciduous trees were used in the overhead plane while five species of evergreen shrubs and thirty species of various deciduous plants were used in the vertical plane. There were forty-five species (nine trees and thirty-six herbaceous plants) forming the ground plane, and various herbaceous plants were utilized without duplication in each garden. The designer's garden of the Garden Show played a role in introducing new groundcover plants to the public. Three of the nine gardens did not include ornamental plants, and the use of decorative plants in other gardens was few compared to the number of plantings. In the Korea Garden Show designer's garden, most of the plants were being used with the intention of exposing the theme or architectural uses. In the 2016 Korea Garden Show designer's garden, many species of plants were used as materials for showcasing themes rather than for creating spaces. Also, the method of 'expression' was used more than the method of 'representation' in order to highlight the theme. This indicates that the planting materials reflect visual characteristics such as color, shape, texture, size rather than ecological characteristics."
