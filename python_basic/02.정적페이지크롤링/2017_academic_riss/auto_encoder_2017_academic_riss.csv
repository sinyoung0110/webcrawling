Deep Auto-encoder Observer Multiple-Model Fast Aircraft Actuator Fault Diagnosis Algorithm,2017,"['Deep auto-encoder', 'fault detection and isolation', 'hidden layer node number', 'multiple model adaptive estimation']",,"In the extended multiple model adaptive estimation fault diagnosis algorithm, the extended Kalman filterhas theoretical limitations, and the establishment of accurate aircraft mathematical model is almost impossible.Meanwhile, there is no automatic method to optimally select the node number of deep neural network hiddenlayer. In this paper, a deep auto-encoder observer multiple-model fault diagnosis algorithm for aircraft actuatorfault is proposed. Based on the empirical formula of the basic auto-encoder hidden layer node number selection(three layered neural network), the recursive formula for deep auto-encoder hidden layer node number selectionare proposed. The deep auto-encoder observers for no-fault and different actuator faults are trained to observethe system state. Combined with multiple model adaptive estimation, the deep auto-encoder observer overcomesthe theoretical limitation of extended Kalman filter, and avoided the calculation of the nonlinear system Jacobianmatrix. The simulation results show that hidden layer node number selection recursive formula is useful. The faultdiagnosis algorithm is more efficient and has better performance compared to the standard methods."

Four gaits of horse riding have repeated pattern according to certain period and the cyclic data extracted from the sensor is used as the input of the auto-encoder which is the feature extractor. We adjust the number of hidden layers suitable for horse riding data, set parameters, compare performance and use softmax function as classifier. In the database construction environment, horse riding expert as national team wears a suit composed of 16 inertial sensors based on a wireless network and obtains a database by circulating the round course. We use 8 feature values to classify horse gaits as an input. Experimental results show that 98% is the highest when using a wavelet packet based auto-encode rather than stacked auto-encoder and sparse auto-encoder."
