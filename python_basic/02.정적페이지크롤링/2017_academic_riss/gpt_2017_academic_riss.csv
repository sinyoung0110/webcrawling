Construction of GPT-Vanishing Structures Using Shape Derivative,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,<P>The Generalized Polarization Tensors (GPT) is a series of tensors which contain informations on the shape of a domain and its material parameters. The aim of this paper is to provide a method of constructing GPT-vanishing structures using shape derivative for two-dimensional conductivity or anti-plane elasticity problem. We assume a multi-coating geometry as a candidate of GPT-vanishing structure. We define a cost functional to minimize GPT and compute the shape derivative of this functional deriving an asymptotic expansion of the perturbations of the GPTs due to a small deformation of interfaces of the structure. We present some numerical examples of GPT-vanishing structures for several different shaped inclusions.</P>
Engineered extracellular microenvironment with a tunable mechanical property for controlling cell behavior and cardiomyogenic fate of cardiac stem cells,2017,"['Cardiac stem cells', 'Microenvironment', 'Elastic modulus', 'Cell behavior', 'Cardiomyogenic fate']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Endogenous cardiac stem cells (CSCs) are known to play a certain role in the myocardial homeostasis of the adult heart. The extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding CSCs provides mechanical signals to regulate a variety of cell behaviors, yet the impact in the adult heart of these mechanical properties of ECM on CSC renewal and fate decisions is mostly unknown. To elucidate CSC mechanoresponses at the individual cell and myocardial level, we used the sol-to-gel transitional gelatin-poly(ethylene glycol)-tyramine (GPT) hydrogel with a tunable mechanical property to construct a three-dimensional (3D) matrix for culturing native myocardium and CSCs. The elastic modulus of the GPT hydrogel was controlled by adjusting cross-linking density using hydrogen peroxide. The GPT hydrogel showed an ability to transduce integrin-mediated signals into the myocardium and to permit myocardial homeostatic processes <I>in vitro</I>, including CSC migration and proliferation into the hydrogel from the myocardium. Decreasing the elastic modulus of the hydrogel resulted in upregulation of phosphorylated integrin-mediated signaling molecules in CSCs, which were associated with significant increases in cell spreading, migration, and proliferation of CSCs in a modulus-dependent manner. However, increasing the elastic modulus of hydrogel induced the arrest of cell growth but led to upregulation of cardiomyocyte-associated mRNAs in CSCs. This work demonstrates that tunable 3D-engineered microenvironments created by GPT hydrogel are able to control CSC behavior and to direct cardiomyogenic fate. Our system may also be appropriate for studying the mechanoresponse of CSCs in a 3D context as well as for developing therapeutic strategies for <I>in situ</I> myocardial regeneration.</P>   <P><B>Statement of Significance</B></P> <P>The extracellular matrix (ECM) provides a physical framework of myocardial niches in which endogenous cardiac stem cells (CSCs) reside, renew, differentiate, and replace cardiac cells. Interactions between ECM and CSCs might be critical for the maintenance of myocardial homeostasis in the adult heart. Yet most studies done so far have used irrelevant cell types and have been performed at the individual cell level, none able to reflect the <I>in vivo</I> situation. By the use of a chemically defined hydrogel to create a tunable 3D microenvironment, we succeeded in controlling CSC behavior at the myocardial and individual cell level and directing the cardiomyogenic fate. Our work may provide insight into the design of biomaterials for <I>in situ</I> myocardial regeneration as well as for tissue engineering.</P>   <P><B>Graphical abstract</B></P>   <P>[DISPLAY OMISSION]</P>"

Markers of obesity, such as body weight, organ weight, diet efficiency, and serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, lipid content, leptin, adiponectin, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT)/glutamic pyruvic transferase (GPT)/lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), blood glucose, and insulin, were measured. Furthermore, results of the oral glucose tolerance test and α-glucosidase inhibition activity were examined in obese mice. Results Mice treated with BBT demonstrate lower body and organ weight, and reduced weight gain and food efficiency than that in the HFD-only control group. In addition, BBT decreased lipid accumulation in the liver and the levels of enzymes such as GOT, GPT, and LDH in the serum. Furthermore, the levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL), and leptin were decreased in the serum but the levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) and adiponectin were increased in the BBT-treated group compared with the control group. The BBT-treated group also demonstrated decreased blood glucose and insulin concentrations induced by feeding on a high-fat diet and improved glucose tolerance. Conclusions Based on the results above, BBT may reduce body fat and hyperglycemia in HFD-induced obesity. This suggests that BBT may be clinically useful in the treatment of obesity.

Among them, an LAB strain-96 (L-96) identifiedas Leuconostoc mesenteroides showed remarkable Pbresistance and removal capacity. The maximum adsorptioncapacity of this strain calculated using the Langmuir isothermwas 60.6 mg Pb/g. In an in vivo experiment, young male micewere provided with water (A), Pb-water (B), or Pb-water+L-96 (C) during puberty. Lower glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase(GOT) and glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT)levels in Pb-exposed male mice that received strain L-96 asa probiotic were suggestive of reduced hepatotoxicity. Moreover,feces from mice treated with L-96 contained more Pbthan feces from untreated mice. Increased Pb eliminationlikely reduced internal accumulation, and this hypothesis wassupported by significantly lower Pb concentrations in kidneysand testes of the mice treated with strain L-96.

First, the researcher selected a sample of raised olive flounder that exhibited typical symptoms of emaciation in three aquafarms in Jeju for experimental use, and then selected healthy-looking olive flounder from one aquafarm that had no past record of emaciation disease, and checked for possibilities of infection through PCR. Averagely, in the hematological analysis shows that haematocrit (Ht), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), and glucose (GLU), emaciated fish groups (Farm A, B, and C) displayed higher experimental values than control group, and in the glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT), total cholesterol (Tchol), and total protein (TP), exhibited lower experimental values than control group. As a result of measuring lysozyme, nitro-blue-tetrazolium (NBT) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), which are markers for non-specific immune responses, lower experimental values were observed in the three experiments. Thus, it can be concluded that a high mortality rate was exhibited due to stress and internal organ damages that resulted from the destruction of the primary defense mechanism that protects fishes from getting infected by emaciation agents."

Methods: For four month from May to August in 2016, we measured twenty-two kinds of VOCs in ten nail shops and carried out health examinations on thirty-four workers in there. Results: The TVOC concentration in indoor air of nail shops is 0.487 ㎎/㎥ at a minimum and 33.236 ㎎/㎥ at a maximum where it consists of 70.5% of Ketones, 25.4% of Alcohols, 2.6% of Esters, 0.8% of Aldehydes and 0.7% of Aromatics. The VOCs concentration during nail art works shows an increase in average ratio 1.8 compared to the concentration of indoor air quality and also the concentration of Isopropanol rose with 3.2 of the highest ratio. The results of Spearman correlation between TVOC concentration in indoor air and environmental factor was like that has significance level of correlation(ρ<0.05, r=0.682) in case of number of customers per day, but the other factors were not meaningful in correlation. Correlation between VOCs and medical check-up items was like that has positive significance level(ρ<0.01, r=0.638) between isopropanol and GPT, but the others have not meaningful. The exposure level of VOCs was not exceed the criteria exposure level 1 of working environment measuring method which announced by labor ministry in all ten nail shop indoor air quality. Conclusions: In this study although it was not significant correlation between harmful substances and medical check-up items in the nail shop indoor air quality, it is necessary to do more ventilation and to install exhaust facilities because of existing high VOCs concentration in the nail shop indoor air."
"죽염의 첨가 급여가 육계의 증체량, 도체성분 및 혈액성분에 미치는 영향",2017,"['bamboo salt', 'broilers', 'growth performance', 'carcass composition', 'blood profile', '죽염', '육계', '육성성적', '도체성분', '혈액성분']","죽염은 우리나라에서 전래되어온 전통적 민간 의방의 하나로서 소화기 장애의 치료제로 사용되었다. 또한 염증, 당뇨, 순환기 질환, 바이러스성 질환 및 암 등 여러 가지 병의 치료에 효과적이라고 알려져 있다. 죽염은 여러 가지 광물질을 함유하고 있어 가축의 사육과정에서 생산성 향상에 영향을 미칠 것으로 사료된다. 따라서 본 시험은 3회 구운 생활죽염을 사료에 첨가 급여할 때 육계의 생산성에 미치는 영향을 규명하기 위하여 기초사료에 죽염을 0.1%, 0.2% 및 0.3% 수준으로 첨가 급여하여 육계의 증체량, 사료섭취량, 사료요구율, 도체성분 및 혈액 성분에 미치는 영향을 분석하고자 사양시험을 실시하였으며, 본 시험에서 얻어진 결과를 요약하면 다음과 같다. 육성전기에 생활죽염 첨가에 의한 증체량의 차이가 나타났으며 0.3% 첨가구인 T3구가 대조구에 비하여 9.6% 향상된 증체성적을 보였다. 사료요구율은 대조구에 비하여 죽염 0.3% 첨가구인 T3 처리구가 유의적으로 낮게 나타나, 약 2.6% 향상된 결과를 보였다(p＜0.05). 또한 음수량과 분변 중 수분함량은 0.3% 죽염을 첨가 급여할 경우, 대조구에 비해 유의적(p＜0.05)으로 증가하였으나, 닭가슴살의 일반성분, 복부지방함량 비율 및 혈액 성분은 죽염 첨가에 의한 유의적인 차이를 보이지 않았다.","This study investigated the effect of bamboo salt (BS) on body gain, feed intake, meat composition, and blood characteristics of broiler chicks. BS was processed by roasting salt at 1,200∼1,300℃ in a bamboo container, with the open end plugged with red clay. In total, 120 broiler chicks were assigned to four treatments. Each treatment was triplicated, with 10 chicks in each treatment group. The supplementation levels of the three BS-treated feeds were 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3%. Body weight gain slightly increased in broiler chicks fed diets supplemented with BS compared to that of the control during the overall test period. However, no significant differences were observed among treatments. Feed intake was also not significantly different among treatments. Feed efficiency was significantly (p＜0.05) improved in broiler chicks fed diets supplemented with BS compared to that of the control. Body weight gain was more positively affected by the dietary BS supplement at the beginning of the experimental period than toward the end. Water intake was positively correlated with the dietary 0.3% BS level (p＜0.05). Breast meat composition and cholesterol levels were also not affected by BS supplementation. The total protein, albumin, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT), and total cholesterol levels in the blood were not significantly different among treatments."
Antioxidative and Anti-Inflammatory Activities of Galloyl Derivatives and Antidiabetic Activities of <i> Acer ginnala</i>,2017,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Chromatographic isolation of the 80% MeOH extract of<I> Acer ginnala</I> (AG) yielded seven galloyl derivatives: gallic acid (<B>1</B>), ginnalin B (<B>2</B>), acertannin (<B>3</B>), maplexin D (<B>4</B>), maplexin E (<B>5</B>), quercetin-3-<I>O</I>-(2′′-galloyl)-<I>α</I>-L-rhamnopyranoside (<B>6</B>), and kaempferol-3-<I>O</I>-(2′′-galloyl)-<I>α</I>-L-rhamnopyranoside (<B>7</B>). This is the first study to report the isolation of compounds<B> 4</B> and<B> 5</B> from AG.
