에세이 창의성 분류를 위한 저빈도 서브워드 마스킹 기반 BERT 모델,2022,"['BERT', 'pre-training', 'creativity', 'subword']","기존의 지식을 바탕으로 새로운 것을 만들어내는 중요성이 높아지고 있는 4차 산업혁명 시대인 만큼 우리는 창의적인 능력이 기를 필요가 있다. 이때 글쓰기는 창의력을 키우는 좋은 도구이다. 창의성은 명확하게 정의하기가 어렵기 때문에 최근 몇 년 동안 창의성에 대한 수많은 연구는 딥 러닝 모델에 기반을 두고 있다. 특히 BERT(Bi-directional Encoder Representation from Transformers)는 마스킹 할 일부 단어를 무작위로 선택하여 사전 훈련 단계를 수행한다. 본 논문에서는 마스킹과정에서 참신한 단어에 중점을 둔다. 추출된 참신한 단어를 기반으로 마스킹 하게되면 BERT 모델은 창의적 에세이를 잘 분류할 수 있는 단어에 더 집중할 수 있다. 따라서 우리는 낮은 빈도수에 해당하는 subword들을 참신한 단어로 여겨, 참신한 단어 마스킹 기반 BERT 모델을 제안한다. 실험 결과 제안한 모델이 기존 BERT 모델에 비해 최대 5% 향상되었다.","In the era of the fourth Industrial Revolution, in which the importance of creating something new based on existing knowledge is increasing, we are required to be creative. At this time, writing is a good tool to develop creativity. Because creativity is very difficult to clearly define, numerous studies on creativity in recent years are based on deep learning models. In particular, Bi-directional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) performs the pre-training step by randomly selecting some words for masking. In this paper, we focuses on novel words for masking. If the extracted novel words are masked, BERT model can focus more on them that can help it classify creative essays well. Therefore, we propose a new novel word masking-based BERT model in which novel words are considered as the corresponding subwords with low frequency. Our experimental results show that our proposed model improved up to 5%, compared to the existing BERT model."

Standardized design gives us benefits when experience gets accumulated, but patterned benefit becoming user centered, not provider centered, beyond the critical point became important in modern society. Therefore, transformer design can be considered as a true design when standardized design achieves practical and economic benefit and value as one-source multi-use as it adds technological, scientific, and economical factors on existing patterned design by expansion, reduction, and transformation through assembly, disassembly, and transformation. The concept of transformation can be a model of attempting fusion becoming demand-centered than making something out of nothing. To prove this, 90% of consumers showed positive response for economic and practical value of transformer design through research hypothesis and questionnaire survey, and 80% of consumers showed intention to repurchase and gave polysemous opinion about the product family. This can be a minority opinion and may not be a combination of various classes.

For this reason, this study aims to propose the survival future of design by denominating transformer design based on a motif of transformer robots as “ST Design (Sustainable Transformer Design)”. As a result of analyzing the concept using the hypothesis with the case, the ST design can be arranged in four ways: manual way and automatic way, idea way, Eco-friendly way. This includes not only changes in appearance design but also performance improvements. Moreover, at the stage of design, the product is designed in consideration of recycling and easy repair, giving meaning of environment-friendly life extension. The importance of design becomes bigger when economic recession prolongs and the needs of design wishing new demands become stronger. With this in mind, Sustainable Transformer Design (ST Design) model was studied by making in-depth approach to concept of transformation and environment-friendly sustainability and analyzing the current state. The fusion of transforming mechanism of ST Design and environment-friendly mechanism can contribute to restricting vicious cycle of overproduction and overconsumption caused by marketing strategy, regardless of intention of consumers. This can serve to be an alternative to proposal of survival future of design, by extending life of design, developing in an easy way and protecting rights of consumers."

The intense ferromagnetic saturation of the iron core is the most influential factor in ferroresonance that makes nonsinusoidal current and voltage. So the nonlinear behavior modeling of the magnetic core is the most important challenge in the study of ferroresonance. In this paper, the ferroresonance phenomenon is investigated in a single phase transformer using the finite element method and considering the hysteresis loop. Jiles-Atherton (JA) inverse vector model is used for modeling the hysteresis loop, which provides the accurate nonlinear model of the transformer core.

Field monitoring of splitting failure for surrounding rock masses and applications of energy dissipation model,2017,"['high geostress', 'underground cavern group', 'splitting failure', 'in-situ monitoring', 'energy dissipation', 'opening displacement']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Due to high in-situ stress and brittleness of rock mass, the surrounding rock masses of underground caverns are prone to appear splitting failure. In this paper, a kind of loading-unloading variable elastic modulus model has been initially proposed and developed based on energy dissipation principle, and the stress state of elements has been determined by a splitting failure criterion. Then the underground caverns of Dagangshan hydropower station is analyzed using the above model. For comparing with the monitoring results, the entire process of rock splitting failure has been achieved through monitoring the splitting failure on side walls of large-scale caverns in Dagangshan via borehole TV, micro-meter and deformation resistivity instrument. It shows that the maximum depth of splitting area in the downstream sidewall of the main power house is approximately 14 m, which is close to the numerical results, about 12.5 m based on the energy dissipation model. As monitoring result, the calculation indicates that the key point displacement of caverns decreases firstly with the distance from main powerhouse downstream side wall rising, and then increases, because this area gets close to the side wall of main transformer house and another smaller splitting zone formed here. Therefore it is concluded that the energy dissipation model can preferably present deformation and fracture zones in engineering, and be very useful for similar projects."

In addition, although the commercial simulation tools provide electric models of a practical transformer for users, it is difficult to analyze intuitively the effects of the circuit performance caused by parameters of practical transformer such as a leakage inductance and mutual inductance. To solve these problems, this paper presents a method for parameter extractions and circuit modeling of a practical transformer. The equivalent model of a practical transformer by the suggested method consists of an ideal transformer model, two resistors, two leakage inductors, and a mutual inductor. The parameters for a practical transformer is extracted by open and short circuit analysis methods, and the electric model of an ideal transformer is made by solving the requirements. To verify the effectiveness of the equivalent model of a practical transformer, a test bed with two winding transformer is built.

Since the thickness of the tie-plate is very thin, and the skin depth is very small, the number of FE elements for 3-D transformer model is too big to solve. So, the surface impedance boundary condition (SIBC) is used to reduce the system matrix size and its computing time.

The external temperature under natural convection condition was set at 25℃ and the heat flux value corresponding to the exothermic parts such as MOSFET was inputted. As a result of the ANSYS simulation with the above thermal analysis condition, the heat sink of the power converter showed a maximum heat distribution of 28.4℃, and the maximum temperature of the power converter including the heat sink was about 59.2℃. From this result, the size (L) 250mm in the horizontal direction of the heat sink selected at the beginning of the development was reduced to 210mm by the simulation result. Experiments were conducted under maximum load conditions (2.5kW) using a reduced 210mm heat sink and two original 250mm heat sinks. There was little temperature difference between the two cases except for the wire part. Looking at the heat distribution, the temperature is high in the busbar and switching device, and is measured at about 51℃ for MOSFET and 33℃ for heat sink. Without ANSYS simulation, it was possible to predict about 30℃ for the heat sink and about 55℃ for the MOSFET. Finally, the resonant current of the transformer with respect to the 2.5kW resistive load, the converter output voltage and the output current were obtained, and the output voltage of 250V could be stably maintained even at the battery voltage of 24V."

Decentralized Demand Response Architecture for Energy Management of Residential Consumers,2017,"['Demand Restraining Limit', 'Electric Vehicle', 'Smart Grid', 'Smart Home Load Management (SHLM)', 'Water-Filling (WF) Algorithm']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Due to the current alarming conditions regarding environmental pollution and growing energy crisis, electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining popularity across the world. According to one estimation [1], there will be 20 million EV fleets on the road by 2020 and that the aggregated sale of EVs will rise to 5.9 million. Integration of large number of EVs to the distribution network will pose serious threats in terms of the reliability and stability of the power system. In order to mitigate the adverse effects on the power system, this paper proposes an approach for the management of EV charging along with smart home load management (SHLM) systems by using a water-filling (WF) algorithm. The proposed framework ensures that the instantaneous load at a distribution transformer is restrained below its rated capacity while consumer preferences are taken into account. In the case that the instantaneous demand increases beyond the transformer capacity, the proposed framework allocates a demand restraining limit (DRL) to each home associated with the transformer. The allocation of the DRL is dynamic and based on the consideration of the convenience factor, demand profile and characteristics of the flexible appliances of all the consumers. The performance of the proposed plan is verified by considering a network consisting of a distribution transformer and five homes."
냉매 열교환기 구성방법에 따른 제 2종 흡수식 히트펌프의 성능 특성 변화에 관한 연구,2017,"['Absorption heat pump(흡수식 히트펌프)', 'Refrigerant heat exchanger(냉매 열교환기)', 'COP(성적계수)', 'H₂O/LiBr(물/리튬브로마이드)', 'Heat transformer(히트 트렌스포머)']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The objective of this study was to determine the effect of refrigerant heat exchanger on the performance of type II absorption heat pump performance using numerical analysis. Two heat exchange installation methods were used: solution to refrigerant and waste hot water to refrigerant. These methods were compared to the standard model of hot water flow without using refrigerant heat exchanger. When waste hot waters were bypassed to refrigerant heat exchanger, COP was not affected. However, steam mass generation rates were increased compared to those of the standard model. When solutions were bypassed to the refrigerant heat exchanger, results were different depending on the place where the solution rejoined. COP and steam mass generation rates were lower compared to those when waste heat water was passed to refrigerant heat exchanger. Thus, it is possible to obtain higher steam mass generation rates by using waste water and installing refrigerant heat exchanger."
