Current Modeling for Accumulation Mode GaN Schottky Barrier MOSFET for Integrated UV Sensors,2017,"['Schottky barrier', 'UV sensor', 'thermionic emission', 'MOSFET', 'gallium nitride']",,"The drain current of the SB MOSFET was analytically modeled by an equation composed of thermionic emission and tunneling with consideration of the image force lowering. The depletion region electron concentration was used to model the channel electron concentration for the tunneling current. The Schottky barrier width is dependent on the channel electron concentration. The drain current is changed by the gate oxide thickness and Schottky barrier height, but it is hardly changed by the doping concentration. For a GaN SB MOSFET with ITO source and drain electrodes, the calculated threshold voltage was 3.5 V which was similar to the measured value of 3.75 V and the calculated drain current was 1.2 times higher than the measured."
Modeling and simulation of efficiency droop in GaN-based blue lightemitting diodes incorporating the effect of reduced active volume of InGaN quantum wells,2017,"['GaN', 'Efficiency droop', 'Light-emitting diode', 'Quantum well']",,The efficiency droop of InGaN-based blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is analyzed using numerical simulations with a modified ABC carrier recombination model. The ABC model is modified to include the effect of reduced effective active volume of InGaN quantum wells (QWs) and incorporated into the numerical simulation program. It is found that the droop of internal quantum efficiency (IQE) can be well explained by the effect of reduced light-emitting active volume without assuming a large Auger recombination coefficient. A simulated IQE curve with the modified ABC model is found to fit quite well with a measured efficiency curve of an InGaN LED sample when the effective active volume takes only 2.5% of the physical volume of QWs. The proposed numerical simulation model incorporating the reduced effective active volume can be advantageous for use in the modeling and simulation of InGaN LEDs for higher efficiency.

CF4 플라즈마 처리를 통한 AlGaN/GaN 쇼트키 배리어 다이오드의 정전기 방전 특성 향상,2017,"['Gallium-nitride (GaN)', 'Schottky barrier diode (SBD)', 'Electrostatic discharge (ESD)', 'CF$_4$ plasma treatment', 'GAN', '쇼트키 베리어 다이오드', '정전기', 'CF$_4$ 플라즈마 처리']","AlGaN/GaN 쇼트키 장벽 다이오드 (Schottky barrier diode)의 정전기 방전 (electrostatic discharge) 특성 개선을 위해 CF$_4$ 플라즈마 처리를 소자에 적용하여 전기적 특성변화를 분석하고 원인 규명을 시도하였다. CF$_4$ 플라즈마 처리는 쇼트키 영역에만 CF$_4$ 30 sccm 유량으로 30초 동안 50와트의 RF 전력으로 진행하였는데, AlGaN/GaN 쇼트키 장벽 다이오드의 전류는 CF$_4$ 플라즈마 처리에 의해 감소하였으며 순방향 전류는 7$\sim$12 배, 누출 전륜는 95$\sim$110 배 감소하였다. 누출 전류의 감소로 정전기 방전에 대한 내성 역시 증가하였고, 쇼트키 장벽 다이오드의 양극 면적과 상관없이 CF$_4$ 플라즈마 처리에 의해 정전기 방전에 대한 내성이 4배 이상 향상되었다. 이것은 CF$_4$ 플라즈마 처리에 의해 형성된 트랩 때문이다. 결과적으로 CF$_4$ 플라즈마 처리는 AlGaN/GaN 쇼트키 장벽 다이오드의 정전기 방전 특성 향상에 큰 역할을 함을 알 수 있었다","In this research, CF$_4$ plasma treatment was performed to improve the reliability of the Schottky barrier diode. The investigation of the Schottky barrier diode focused on improving in the leakage current, breakdown voltage and electrostatic discharge (ESD) characteristics of the device. The CF$_4$ plasma treatment was performed using CF$_4$ (30 sccm) gas under a 50 W RF power and a 10 mTorr working pressure on the surface of an AlGaN layer for 30 seconds. The current of the device was decreased when the plasma treatments were used. The forward current was decreased 7$\sim$12 times, and the leakage current was decreased 95$\sim$1100 times, as well. However, the breakdown voltage and the ESD characteristics of the devices were improved because of the decrease in the leakage current. The measurements of ESD were conducted using human body model (HBM), and the ESD characteristics of the device were improved by plasma treatments. With increasing area of the Schottky diode, the ESD characteristics were dramatically improved. Therefore, the CF$_4$ plasma treatment in the area of the AlGaN/GaN SBD can be concluded to have improved the robustness of the device (resistance to an ESD) by decreasing the leakage current."
Effects of P3HT Concentration on the Electrical Properties of the Au/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT/n-GaN Hybrid Junction Structure,2017,"['GaN', 'P3HT concentration', 'Inorganic-organic junction', 'I-V characteristics']",,"An inorganic-organic hybrid junction has been fabricated by spin coating the p-type poly(3- hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)(P3HT) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) on an n-type GaN layer. The GaN layer was formed on Al2O3 by metal organic chemical vapor deposition(MOCVD) method. To investigate the effects of P3HT concentration on the electrical properties, we changed P3HT solution concentration and speed of spin coater. The currentvoltage (I-V ) characteristic of Au/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT/n-GaN shows rectifying behavior. The I-V characteristic was examined in the frame work of the thermionic emission model. The most proper rectifying behavior was obtained for 0.6 wt% and thickness below 65 nm of P3HT used diode. We expect that such hybrid structures, suitably developed,"
High temperature storage test and its effect on the thermal stability and electrical characteristics of AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors,2017,['AlGaN/GaN HEMT High temperature storage Reliability Gate contact'],,"The high temperature storage (HTS) effects on the thermal stability and electrical characteristics of AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) were investigated. The step-temperature storage tests in the temperature range from 150 C to 325 C were performed to evaluate the reliability of device.It was shown that the electrical properties of devices were remarkably changed as temperature increases.The values of the saturation current and the transconductance ranged from 187 mA to 299 mS/mm (fresh device) to 149 mA and 246 mS/mm (after HTS at 325 C), respectively. In addition, the threshold voltage was shifted in a positive position and the leakage current was significantly decreased. In order to analyze the fundamental mechanisms of device degradation, we investigated the ohmic contact reliability by the transmission line model and analyzed the gate diode characteristics to estimate the diode parameters. It was found that Ti/Al/Ni/Au ohmic contact were stable and showed good thermal performance, but the Schottky contact was more sensitive to the HTS test. Failure analysis using electrical characterization of the gate diode and TEM/EDX cross-section revealed that the gate metal diffusion phenomenon was main degradation mechanism. During HTS test, Ni diffused out from the metal-semiconductor interface and Au formed a Schottky contact on AlGaN layer. To suppress the gate deformation, we adopted the optimum passivation and demonstrated its effect on the device reliability. By comparing the behavior of gate during HTS test, we clarified that the optimum passivation could suppress the diffusion related degradation mechanism and increase the reliability of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs."
차량 번호판 화질 개선을 위한 GAN 기반의 초해상도 기법,2017,"['super resolution', 'generative adversarial network', 'deep learning', 'image recognition', 'license plate']",,"Convolutional neural networks and generative adversarial neural networks have recently shown outstanding performance in single-image super-resolution. In this paper, we propose a deep super-resolution method based on generative adversarial networks to reconstruct a high-resolution license plate image from a low-resolution license plate image to improve the accuracy of lowresolution license plate recognition. To achieve this, we create a super-resolution model using deep residual blocks. In addition, our model uses the benefits of adversarial loss, pixel-wise loss, and perceptual loss. Adversarial loss plays a role in enabling the discriminator network to distinguish between the high-resolution image and the fake high-resolution image generated by the generator network well, while it facilitates the generator network to generate a realistic high-resolution image with the goal of fooling the discriminator network. Pixel-wise loss and perceptual loss help the generator network to reconstruct a better high-resolution image. We compare the proposed method and other state-of-the-art methods with the performance of the license plate image recognizer. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method performs well by showing that the accuracy of the lowresolutionimage is improved from 38.45 to 73.65% by the proposed method."
Modeling of the ITZ zone in concrete: Experiment and numerical simulation,2017,"['FEM', 'cutoff bar', 'ITZ', 'compressive strength', 'full bond']",,"The discovery of the Interfacial Transition Zone (ITZ) by Farran in 1956 initiated a new era in the study of the behaviour of concrete. Acknowledged as the weak link, this ITZ was studied extensively, numerically as well as experimentally. While the complementary experimental tests illustrated the visual behaviour of this specimen under increasing monotonic compression loading, a perfect bond within the ITZ has also been studied by using finite element analysis for comparison purposes. Finite element analysis was used to evaluate the degree of correctness and precision of the proposed ITZ model. This paper discusses the use of the cutoff bar in finite element modeling, representing the ITZ of a single aggregate (inclusion) in a mortar matrix. Experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of the ITZ model on the single inclusion specimen’s strength. The model was tested for some inclusions that varied in dimension and shape. The effect of inclusion shape on the stress concentrations of the specimens was examined. The aim of this research work is to propose a simple yet accurate ITZ model to be used in the commercially available finite element software packages."

"Government Domestic Debt, Private Sector Credit, and Crowding Out Effect in Oil-Dependent Countries",2017,"['banks', 'liquidity', 'oil-dependent', 'crowding out', 'credit']",,"Banks are more liquid, better capitalised, and more profitable in oil-dependent countries. However, bank credit to the private sector is relatively low as a percentage of GDP. The low level has been blamed, amongst other reasons, on governments` reliance on the banking sector to finance fiscal deficits. This study examines the crowding out effect of government domestic borrowing using a panel data model for 28 oil-dependent countries over the period 1990-2012. We estimate the model, using both fixed effects and generalised method of moments estimators and find that a one percent increase in government borrowing from domestic banks significantly decreases private sector credit by 0.22 percent and has no significant impact on the lending rate banks charge to the private sector. This finding suggests that government domestic borrowing has resulted in the shrinking of private credit and works through the credit channel and not the interest rate channel."

Those who worried most the low fertility rate were the conservatives, while the progressivists holding neo- Malthusian view did not. Alva & Gunnar Myrdal, the spouse with social democratic inclination, published the book The Crisis in Population Problem (Kris i befolkningsfrågan) in 1934 and thereby changed fundamentally the debate terrain. They acknowledged the seriousness of the declining fertility rate, contrary to the conservatives, however, they maintained that it would be possible to raise fertility rate and improve the ‘quality of people’ by progressive family policies. The core idea of their family policy proposals was that society should take the burden of children rearing costs and should support the married working women for holding down job and running household at the same time. Justifications of Alva & Gunnar Myrdal for their family policy ideas included economic logics which can be expressed as ‘economies of scale’, ‘consumer ignorance’, ‘human capital theory’, and ‘internalization of externality’ in modern economics. The philosophical foundations of Alva & Gunnar Myrdal, in terms of their ideological orientation or value orientation, were feminism, socialism, mild nationalism, and utilitarianism. In terms of the approach to social issues, very strong rationalism is found. Especially utilitarianism and rationalism were the hardcore of their philosophy. Even though their approach can be criticized in that they pursued too much the social engineering styled rationality, their contribution should be highly acknowledged if we consider the situation of the Swedish society at that time. Alva & Gunnar Myrdal intended to use the population debate as a good chance for trying progressive social reforms, and their intention was largely realized. Substantial parts of the Swedish welfare state model are debted to the intellectual legacy of Alva & Gunnar Myrdal."

The 21st century is the era of Nak Ja Saeng Zon (樂者生存). Every citizen has dignity and value as human beings and has the right to pursue happiness. As Aristotle emphasized, the purpose of education is to create a sustained happy life through character personality and self-realization. Since its liberation from Japan August 15th in 1945, Korean education has oriented itself towards success-oriented life under the educational idea of Hong Ik In Gan (弘益人間). It is a well-known fact that Korean education has contributed to the development of the country by creating successful individuals. However, looking at the reality of Korean education, the voices of criticism that students are increasingly becoming unhappy has been getting louder from day to day. Moreover, in spite of the fact that success-oriented teleologism of education has not only various strengths, but also fatal shortcomings. By internalizing the murderous competitive spirit and by making most of students hope that time passes as fast as possible, it has made everyone live a suicidal life. To make matters worse, most of Korean teachers are expected to become a model of happy life and have to make a good circle of happy life throughout their lives have lived the same pattern of success-oriented teleologism. Our greatest happiness does not depend on the condition of life, but is always the result of a good conscience, good health, occupation and freedom in all just pursuits. The three grand essential of happiness are : something to do, someone to love, and something to hope for. In sum, I suggest as follows : First of all, we should transform the success-oriented teleologism of education into the happiness-oriented teleologism of education as soon as possible. Secondly, we should do our best efforts to remold our educational circumstances in which all students and teachers can be happy."

In the event of understanding composition of the poetry history through the existing way, the big stream can be comprehended but it cannot be confirmed that it applies to individual works. Particularly, a new way is required for this since it has never been figured out as a single stream in late Goryeo and early Joseon. This study will try to grasp the meaning of the succession and discontinuity of the poetic tradition through the `authentic precedent` based on a model of the poet, Yu Bang-Sun in late Goryeo and early Joseon. Yu Bang-Sun inherited the genealogy of Lee Saek, Lee Sung-In, Kwon Geun, and Byeon Gye-Ryang in late Goryeo, and brought up the literary persons who are representing Seo Geo-Jeong, Lee Seung-So, Seong Gan in early Joseon. Yu Bang-Sun has actively borrowed the works of his predecessors, enough to be accused of plagiarism when creating poetry. This shows the basis of his own creation by succeeding in the poetic achievements of his predecessors. As a result of verifying through actual works, the poetic tradition borrowed by Yu Bang-Sun continued to the next generations and stopped at him. Yu Bang-Sun played the role of connecting link while the tradition of the poetry history was succeeded and discontinued. The core principle of the authentic precedent in terms of Chinese poem is ""translation"". Authentic precedent translated by Goryeo`s authors has become a `new tradition` (`Korean authentic precedent`) and enriched their creative work. The creations that were born in such way became `authentic precedent` again. The authors of Joseon made their own creations through translating this new authentic precedent. Thus, the history of Korean poetics was made up through succession and discontinuity of authentic precedent. It is desired that we will find out the context of history of Korean poetics and keep track of the succession and disconnection of the poetic tradition based on the keyword of `authentic precedent and translation` in the future."

Firstly, we establish the energy consumption models for multi-hop SISO, multi-hop DSTBC based CMISO, multi-hop CB based CMISO transmissions under random nodes deployment. Then, we minimize the energy consumption by searching the optimal nodes deployment for the three transmissions. Furthermore, numerical results present the optimal nodes deployment parameters for the three transmissions. Energy consumption of the three transmissions are compared under optimal nodes deployment, which shows that CB based CMISO transmission consumes less energy than SISO and DSTBC based CMISO transmissions. Meanwhile, under optimal nodes deployment, the superiorities of CB based CMISO transmission over SISO and DSTBC based CMISO transmissions can be more obvious when path-loss-factor becomes low."
