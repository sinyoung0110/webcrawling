에세이 창의성 분류를 위한 저빈도 서브워드 마스킹 기반 BERT 모델,2022,"['BERT', 'pre-training', 'creativity', 'subword']","기존의 지식을 바탕으로 새로운 것을 만들어내는 중요성이 높아지고 있는 4차 산업혁명 시대인 만큼 우리는 창의적인 능력이 기를 필요가 있다. 이때 글쓰기는 창의력을 키우는 좋은 도구이다. 창의성은 명확하게 정의하기가 어렵기 때문에 최근 몇 년 동안 창의성에 대한 수많은 연구는 딥 러닝 모델에 기반을 두고 있다. 특히 BERT(Bi-directional Encoder Representation from Transformers)는 마스킹 할 일부 단어를 무작위로 선택하여 사전 훈련 단계를 수행한다. 본 논문에서는 마스킹과정에서 참신한 단어에 중점을 둔다. 추출된 참신한 단어를 기반으로 마스킹 하게되면 BERT 모델은 창의적 에세이를 잘 분류할 수 있는 단어에 더 집중할 수 있다. 따라서 우리는 낮은 빈도수에 해당하는 subword들을 참신한 단어로 여겨, 참신한 단어 마스킹 기반 BERT 모델을 제안한다. 실험 결과 제안한 모델이 기존 BERT 모델에 비해 최대 5% 향상되었다.","In the era of the fourth Industrial Revolution, in which the importance of creating something new based on existing knowledge is increasing, we are required to be creative. At this time, writing is a good tool to develop creativity. Because creativity is very difficult to clearly define, numerous studies on creativity in recent years are based on deep learning models. In particular, Bi-directional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) performs the pre-training step by randomly selecting some words for masking. In this paper, we focuses on novel words for masking. If the extracted novel words are masked, BERT model can focus more on them that can help it classify creative essays well. Therefore, we propose a new novel word masking-based BERT model in which novel words are considered as the corresponding subwords with low frequency. Our experimental results show that our proposed model improved up to 5%, compared to the existing BERT model."

The East China Sea in DOD China Military Power Reports,2017,"['East China Sea', 'geopolitics', 'China', 'Japan', 'Taiwan', 'United States', 'territorial claims', 'maritime claims', 'U.S. Department of Defense information resources']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The National Defense Authorization Act of 2000 saw Congress require the Department of Defense (DOD) to prepare an annual report on Chinese military power. This report contains classified and unclassified editions. Documenting Chinese military developments, strategy, and trends are critical parts of these reports. Beijing`s military activities in the East China Sea (ECS) are important report components. This work explains the importance of these and other DOD reports for those studying ECS developments, examines how DOD has documented Beijing`s military activities within these publicly accessible reports, and describes how members of Congress have reacted to ECS developments during the Obama Administration."
가해자와 피해자를 위한 조직세우기 - 한일 위안부 문제를 중심으로 -,2017,"['가해자', '피해자', '조직세우기', '위안부', 'Perpetrator', 'Victim', 'System constellation', 'Comfort women']","한국과 일본의 위안부 문제는 정부 당국자들끼리의 합의가 있었지만 아무 효력을 발휘하지 못하고 있다. 가족세우기를 오랫동안 실시하였던 연구자는 조직세우기를 통해 나라간의 분쟁 사건에 대한 해답도 찾을 수 있다는 생각이 있었다. Bert Hellinger가 가족세우기로 시작하였지만 조직세우기로도 발전하고 있기에 조직세우기 입장에서 이 문제를 다루고 싶었다. 총 3번의 조직세우기를 통해 위안부 문제해결과 한국과 일본이 화해의 길을 갈 것에 대한 통찰을 얻을 수 있었다. 첫째, 위안부들은 나라와 국민에게서 버림받았던 아픔이 있는데 해방된 이후에도 제대로 국민으로 인정받고, 가족으로 인정받지 못했었다는 것이다. 둘째, 돌아온 위안부들에게 유교적 윤리관으로 대하였던 것에서 여성인권의 차원으로 그들을 존중하고 사랑하는 눈으로 바라보아야 한다는 것이다. 그래서 위안부들과 한국의 지도자들, 국민들이 서로를 바라보고 같이 울 수 있는 것이 문제 해결의 출발점이라는 것이다. 셋째, 소녀상을 세우면 강하게 자신들을 합리화하거나 정당화했던 일본군인, 일본 강경파들도 힘이 약해지고 주저앉게 한다는 것이다. 여성인권의 차원에서 위안부의 옛 모습인 소녀상을 세워 성폭력, 집단폭력의 아픔이 없도록 하는 것은 가해자들과 가해자 집단들이 자신들의 아픔을 정리하도록 촉진한다. 넷째, 시대적인 상황에 따라 가해자와 피해자가 된 그들을 모두 품고 화해한 후에 함께 새로운 길을 찾아가는 길을 마련하는 것이 우리의 역할이라는 것을 알게 되었다","The Japanese Military Sexual Slavery, known as the “Comfort Women” have been settled between the governments of Korea and Japan, yet it has not make any effect. The researcher considered the possibility of attaining reconciliation through system constellation, after practicing family constellation for a long period of time. Bert Hellinger began his constellation work with family, which later progressed into system constellation. The comfort women problem has been viewed with this perspective of system constellation. Through three system constellation sessions, insightful conclusions were drawn about how the comfort women problem could be solved and the two countries can reconcile. First of all, the comfort women had been abandoned by their country and its people. Even after the country’s independence, they were not properly recognized as its people and family. The leaders of Korea and its people including the women’s own family members should view them with respect and love. Second of all, the comfort women were treated with Confucian morality. They should be treated with respect and love in consideration of female human rights. The starting point for solving this problem can be made when the comfort women, Korea’s leaders and its people can look at each other and cry together. Third of all, installing the comfort women statue will weaken the Japanese soldiers and hardliners who had rationalized their actions against the comfort women. Installing the statue will push the assailant and victim groups to deal with their troubles and pain from the past such as sexual assault and mass violence. Last of all, it is our role to embrace both groups that became assailants and victims due to the circumstances of the times, to help them reconcile and together find a new path."

The First Year After Colorectal Surgery in the Elderly,2017,"['Colorectal cancer', 'Colorectal surgery', 'Complications', 'Elderly', 'Survival']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Purpose: Surgery for colorectal malignancy is increasingly being performed in the elderly. Little is known about the impact of complications on late mortality. This study aimed to analyze whether a complicated postoperative course affects the 1-year survival in elderly patients.Methods: All consecutive patients older than 75 years of age who underwent colorectal cancer surgery between January 2009 and April 2013 were included in this study. The main outcome was mortality at 1 year after surgery. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine risk factors for a poor outcome (mortality) after survival of the early postoperative course of surgery at 1-year follow-up. Patients who died within 30 days postoperatively were excluded from analysis.Results: The early mortality rate was 6.3% (n = 15), and 2 patients died during follow-up as a result of complications after a second surgery. A total of 223 patients survived the perioperative period and were included in this study. Twenty-two patients (9.9%) died during the first year of follow-up. Stage IV disease (P = 0.002), complications of primary surgery (P = 0.016), and comorbidity (P = 0.050) were risk factors for 1-year mortality. Intensive care unit stay, reoperation and readmission were not associated with a worse 1-year outcome.Conclusion: Elderly patients with stage IV disease at the time of surgery, comorbidity, and postoperative complications are at risk for mortality during the first year after surgery. A patient-tailored approach with special attention to perioperative care should be considered in the elderly."
