We first briefly overview the theoretical implications and practical limitations of a rational decision-making perspective, focusing on its unrealistic assumptions. We then discuss the capability of machine learning–based decision-making that may overcome the limitations of human decision-making by reviewing recent research comparing the decision performance of machine learning algorithms with human decisions in the context of crowdlending. Our findings demonstrate that machine learning algorithms may outperform human decisions in structured problems, whereas human decisions are critical in unstructured problems such as meta-decisions(e.g., what to decide and how to decide). We draw three policy implications for the introduction of machine learning into public administration. First, public administrators and policymakers should determine the nature of the decision task; i.e., whether it is a structured problem or an unstructured problem that may require meta-decisions. Second, meta-decisions regarding the decision criteria (e.g., accountability, effectiveness) are required for machine learning algorithms aiming to resolve structured problems. Third, public administrators and policymakers should develop the ability and skills to implement evidence-based decision-making in order to make a high-quality meta-decision for unstructured problems.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

A Nature-inspired Multiple Kernel Extreme Learning Machine Model for Intrusion Detection,2020,"['Meta-heuristics', 'Kernel extreme learning machine', 'Multiple kernel learning', 'Intrusion detection']",,"The application of machine learning (ML) in intrusion detection has attracted much attention with the rapid growth of information security threat. As an efficient multi-label classifier, kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) has been gradually used in intrusion detection system. However, the performance of KELM heavily relies on the kernel selection. In this paper, a novel multiple kernel extreme learning machine (MKELM) model combining the ReliefF with nature-inspired methods is proposed for intrusion detection. The MKELM is designed to estimate whether the attack is carried out and the ReliefF is used as a preprocessor of MKELM to select appropriate features. In addition, the nature-inspired methods whose fitness functions are defined based on the kernel alignment are employed to build the optimal composite kernel in the MKELM. The KDD99, NSL and Kyoto datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the model. The experimental results indicate that the optimal composite kernel function can be determined by using any heuristic optimization method, including PSO, GA, GWO, BA and DE. Since the filter-based feature selection method is combined with the multiple kernel learning approach independent of the classifier, the proposed model can have a good performance while saving a lot of training time.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv
Enhancing the Reliability of Wi-Fi Network Using Evil Twin AP Detection Method Based on Machine Learning,2020,"['Access Point', 'Classification Algorithm', 'Clock Skew', 'Evil Twin AP', 'Rogue AP', 'Wireless Network']",,"Wireless networks have become integral to society as they provide mobility and scalability advantages. However, their disadvantage is that they cannot control the media, which makes them vulnerable to various types of attacks. One example of such attacks is the evil twin access point (AP) attack, in which an authorized AP is impersonated by mimicking its service set identifier (SSID) and media access control (MAC) address. Evil twin APs are a major source of deception in wireless networks, facilitating message forgery and eavesdropping. Hence, it is necessary to detect them rapidly. To this end, numerous methods using clock skew have been proposed for evil twin AP detection. However, clock skew is difficult to calculate precisely because wireless networks are vulnerable to noise. This paper proposes an evil twin AP detection method that uses a multiple-feature-based machine learning classification algorithm. The features used in the proposed method are clock skew, channel, received signal strength, and duration. The results of experiments conducted indicate that the proposed method has an evil twin AP detection accuracy of 100% using the random forest algorithm.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Consequently, technologies related to data analysis are growing in importance. The shipbuilding industry has high production uncertainty and variability, which has created an urgent need for data analysis techniques, such as machine learning. In particular, the industry cannot effectively respond to changes in the production-related standard time information systems, such as the basic cycle time and lead time. Improvement measures are necessary to enable the industry to respond swiftly to changes in the production environment. In this study, the lead times for fabrication, assembly of ship block, spool fabrication and painting were predicted using machine learning technology to propose a new management method for the process lead time using a master data system for the time element in the production data. Data preprocessing was performed in various ways using R and Python, which are open source programming languages, and process variables were selected considering their relationships with the lead time through correlation analysis and analysis of variables. Various machine learning, deep learning, and ensemble learning algorithms were applied to create the lead time prediction models. In addition, the applicability of the proposed machine learning methodology to standard work hour prediction was verified by evaluating the prediction models using the evaluation criteria, such as the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE).",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Thus, it is important for the prevention of suicide to screen the individuals with SI. This study aimed to identify the factors associated with SI and to build prediction models in Korean adults using machine learning methods. Methods The 2010–2013 dataset of the Korea National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey was used as the training dataset (n=16,437), and the subset collected in 2015 was used as the testing dataset (n=3,788). Various machine learning algorithms were applied and compared to the conventional logistic regression (LR)-based model. Results Common risk factors for SI included stress awareness, experience of continuous depressive mood, EQ-5D score, depressive disorder, household income, educational status, alcohol abuse, and unmet medical service needs. The prediction performances of the machine learning models, as measured by the area under receiver-operating curve, ranged from 0.794 to 0.877, some of which were better than that of the conventional LR model (0.867). The Bayesian network, LogitBoost with LR, and ANN models outperformed the conventional LR model.

A machine-learning expert-supporting system for diagnosis prediction of lymphoid neoplasms using a probabilistic decision-tree algorithm and immunohistochemistry profile database,2020,"['Database', 'Expert-supporting system', 'Machine learning', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Probabilistic decision tree']",,"Background: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) has played an essential role in the diagnosis of hematolymphoid neoplasms. However, IHC interpretations can be challenging in daily practice, and exponentially expanding volumes of IHC data are making the task increasingly difficult. We therefore developed a machine-learning expert-supporting system for diagnosing lymphoid neoplasms. Methods: A probabilistic decision-tree algorithm based on the Bayesian theorem was used to develop mobile application software for iOS and Android platforms. We tested the software with real data from 602 training and 392 validation cases of lymphoid neoplasms and compared the precision hit rates between the training and validation datasets. Results: IHC expression data for 150 lymphoid neoplasms and 584 antibodies was gathered. The precision hit rates of 94.7% in the training data and 95.7% in the validation data for lymphomas were not statistically significant. Results in most B-cell lymphomas were excellent, and generally equivalent performance was seen in T-cell lymphomas. The primary reasons for lack of precision were atypical IHC profiles for certain cases (e.g., CD15-negative Hodgkin lymphoma), a lack of disease-specific markers, and overlapping IHC profiles of similar diseases. Conclusions: Application of the machine-learning algorithm to diagnosis precision produced acceptable hit rates in training and validation datasets. Because of the lack of origin- or disease-specific markers in differential diagnosis, contextual information such as clinical and histological features should be taken into account to make proper use of this system in the pathologic decision-making process.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Methods The study conducted a retrospective analysis of pneumonia patients at an emergency department (ED) in Seoul, Korea, from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2017. Patients aged 18 years or older with a pneumonia registry designation on their electronic medical record were enrolled. We collected their demographic information, mental status, and laboratory findings. Three models were used: the pre-existing CURB-65 model, and the CURB-RF and Extensive CURB-RF models, which were machine-learning models that used a random forest algorithm. The primary outcomes were ICU admission from the ED or 30-day mortality. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed for the models, and the areas under these curves were compared. Results Out of the 1,974 pneumonia patients, 1,732 patients were eligible to be included in the study; from these, 473 patients died within 30 days or were initially admitted to the ICU from the ED. The area under receiver operating characteristic curves of CURB-65, CURB-RF, and extensive-CURB-RF were 0.615 (0.614–0.616), 0.701 (0.700–0.702), and 0.844 (0.843–0.845), respectively. Conclusion The proposed machine-learning models could predict the mortality of patients with pneumonia more accurately than the pre-existing CURB-65 model and can help decide whether the patient should be admitted to the ICU.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv
Heart-Rate-Based Machine-Learning Algorithms for Screening Orthostatic Hypotension,2020,"['orthostatic hypotension', 'heart rate', 'Valsalva maneuver', 'machine learning']",,"Background and Purpose Many elderly patients are unable to actively stand up by themselves and have contraindications to performing the head-up tilt test (HUTT). We aimed to develop screening algorithms for diagnosing orthostatic hypotension (OH) before performing the HUTT.Methods This study recruited 663 patients with orthostatic intolerance (78 with and 585 without OH, as confirmed by the HUTT) and compared their clinical characteristics. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to investigate potential predictors of an OH diagnosis. Machine-learning algorithms were applied to determine whether the accuracy of OH prediction could be used for screening OH without performing the HUTT.Results Differences between expiration and inspiration (E-I differences), expiration:inspiration ratios (E:I ratios), and Valsalva ratios were smaller in patients with OH than in those without OH. The univariate analysis showed that increased age and baseline systolic blood pressure (BP) as well as decreased E-I difference, E:I ratio, and Valsalva ratio were correlated with OH. In the multivariate analysis, increased baseline systolic BP and decreased Valsalva ratio were found to be independent predictors of OH. Using those variables as input features, the classification accuracies of the support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest methods were 84.4%, 84.4%, and 90.6%, respectively.Conclusions We have identified clinical parameters that are strongly associated with OH. Machine- learning analysis using those parameters was highly accurate in differentiating OH from non-OH patients. These parameters could be useful screening factors for OH in patients who are unable to perform the HUTT.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Prediction of the Emotion Responses to Poster Designs based on Graphical Features: A Machine learning-driven Approach,2020,"['Graphic Design', 'Machine Learning', 'Image Features', 'PAD Theory', 'Color', 'Layout', 'Emotion']",,"Background : Advances in data science have allowed us to investigate human emotions based on the learning of the data set, with current technology enabling us to research the relationship between the form elements of graphic images and human emotional responses. However, to date, studies have been limited to photography, meaning that the practice of graphic design remains unexplored.Methods : We used a design workshop to exploit graphic elements that are perceptually relevant. By identifying and quantifying the elements of each image (N = 320), we were able to define the machine learning features. We collected emotion assessments relating to the images with regard to pleasure, arousal, and dominance using a Likert scale, and combined them with the features to build a dataset. The assessments were carried out twice to form a baseline of accuracy. Applying machine learning methods such as kknn, svmRadial, and C5.0, we modeled algorithms that predict individuals’ emotional assessments of specific aspects.Results : Human assessments were repeatedly in the range of 62.81–80.93%, and a prediction accuracy between 52.26–80.32% was achieved. In particular, the prediction accuracy of pleasure and dominance aspects was relatively high across all individuals.Conclusions : This study demonstrates the use of machine learning-driven algorithm modeling to predict assessments of emotion based on graphical elements of movie posters. Overall, predictions of pleasure and dominance aspects showed higher accuracy than those of the arousal aspect. Limitations and further investigations are discussed to obtain not only a more accurate but also a more insightful estimation.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

A Novel Tool (Single-Flute) Condition Monitoring Method for End Milling Process Based on Intelligent Processing of Milling Force Data by Machine Learning Algorithms,2020,['Cutting force simulation · Manifold learning · Polynomial kernel SVM · Principal component analysis (PCA) · Tool condition monitoring (TCM)'],,"Tool condition monitoring is deemed as an essential technology of the intelligent manufacturing. Tool wear which directly affects the tool life makes a negative influence on the quality and dimensional accuracy of the machined surface, even leads to tool breakage, machine downtime, and other severe problems. Therefore, an available tool condition monitoring system is essential for the machining process to guarantee the processing quality and improve the machining efficiency. This paper proposes a new tool condition monitoring method based on the general judgment of cutting force. Milling force from a single-flute is predicted by deducing a theoretical formula based on un-deformed chip thickness. Based on the formula, cutting force samples used for machine learning paradigms are generated through time domain translation and Gaussian distribution. Nonlinear manifold learning methods are applied in the visualization of high dimensional data. Principal component analysis as a practical feature extraction method is used to reduce the large dimensionality of the sample set. The performance of respectively linear kernel, polynomial kernel, radial basis function and sigmoid kernel are self-compared to estimate the classification results via support vector machine. Experiments are carried out on an annealed Ti–6Al–4V alloy to measure the feasibility of this method.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. According to WHO(World Health Organization)’s situation report published on May 18th, 2020, COVID-19 has already affected 4,600,000 cases and 310,000 deaths globally and still increasing. The most severe problem of COVID-19 virus is that it spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, which occurs in everyday life.

Prognosticating idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) is an important challenge. In our study, a dataset was split into training and test sets and cross-validation was implemented on the training set, thereby determining the hyperparameters for machine learning models with high test accuracy and low bias. The effectiveness of the following five machine learning models for predicting the hearing prognosis in patients with ISSNHL after 1 month of treatment was assessed: adaptive boosting, K-nearest neighbor, multilayer perceptron, random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM).Methods. The medical records of 523 patients with ISSNHL admitted to Korea University Ansan Hospital between January 2010 and October 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. In this study, we analyzed data from 227 patients (recovery, 106; no recovery, 121) after excluding those with missing data. To determine risk factors, statistical hypothesis tests (e.g., the two-sample t-test for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables) were conducted to compare patients who did or did not recover. Variables were selected using an RF model depending on two criteria (mean decreases in the Gini index and accuracy).Results. The SVM model using selected predictors achieved both the highest accuracy (75.36%) and the highest F-score (0.74) on the test set. The RF model with selected variables demonstrated the second-highest accuracy (73.91%) and F-score (0.74). The RF model with the original variables showed the same accuracy (73.91%) as that of the RF model with selected variables, but a lower F-score (0.73). All the tested models, except RF, demonstrated better performance after variable selection based on RF.Conclusion. The SVM model with selected predictors was the best-performing of the tested prediction models. The RF model with selected predictors was the second-best model.

Development of a Wearable Inertial Sensor-based Gait Analysis Device Using Machine Learning Algorithms -Validity of the Temporal Gait Parameter in Healthy Young Adults,2020,"['Gait', 'Machine learning', 'Wearable electronic devices', 'Motion']",,"Purpose: The study aims were to develop a wearable inertial sensor-based gait analysis device that uses machine learning algorithms, and to validate this novel device using temporal gait parameters. Methods: Thirty-four healthy young participants (22 male, 12 female, aged 25.76 years) with no musculoskeletal disorders were asked to walk at three different speeds. As they walked, data were simultaneously collected by a motion capture system and inertial measurement units (Reseed®). The data were sent to a machine learning algorithm adapted to the wearable inertial sensor-based gait analysis device. The validity of the newly developed instrument was assessed by comparing it to data from the motion capture system. Results: At normal speeds, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) for the temporal gait parameters were excellent (ICC [2, 1], 0.99∼0.99), and coefficient of variation (CV) error values were insignificant for all gait parameters (0.31∼1.08%). At slow speeds, ICCs for the temporal gait parameters were excellent (ICC [2, 1], 0.98∼0.99), and CV error values were very small for all gait parameters (0.33∼1.24%). At the fastest speeds, ICCs for temporal gait parameters were excellent (ICC [2, 1], 0.86∼0.99) but less impressive than for the other speeds. CV error values were small for all gait parameters (0.17∼5.58%).

First, the proposed method periodically mines data about how user likes for heating (winter)/cooling (summer) his or her home by learning his or her usage pattern of setting temperature set-point of the thermostat during the past several weeks. Then, from this learning, the proposed method establishes a weekly schedule about temperature setting. Next, by referring to thermal comfort chart by ASHRAE, it makes rules about how to adjust temperature set-points as much as low (winter) or high (summer) while the newly adjusted temperature set-point satisfies thermal comfort zone for predicted humidity. In order to make rules work on time or events, we adopt rule engine so that it can achieve energy savings properly without sacrifice of occupants’ comfort. Through experiments, it is shown that the proposed smart thermostat temperature set-point control method can achieve better energy savings while keeping human comfort compared to other conventional thermostat.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv
Damage detection in truss bridges using transmissibility and machine learning algorithm: Application to Nam O bridge,2020,"['transmissibility', 'machine learning algorithm', 'Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)', 'Structural Health Monitoring (SHM)', 'large-scale truss bridge']",,"This paper proposes the use of transmissibility functions combined with a machine learning algorithm, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), to assess damage in a truss bridge. A new approach method, which makes use of the input parameters calculated from the transmissibility function, is proposed. The network not only can predict the existence of damage, but also can classify the damage types and identity the location of the damage. Sensors are installed in the truss joints in order to measure the bridge vibration responses under train and ambient excitations. A finite element (FE) model is constructed for the bridge and updated using FE software and experimental data. Both single damage and multiple damage cases are simulated in the bridge model with different scenarios. In each scenario, the vibration responses at the considered nodes are recorded and then used to calculate the transmissibility functions. The transmissibility damage indicators are calculated and stored as ANNs inputs. The outputs of the ANNs are the damage type, location and severity. Two machine learning algorithms are used; one for classifying the type and location of damage, whereas the other for finding the severity of damage. The measurements of the Nam O bridge, a truss railway bridge in Vietnam, is used to illustrate the method. The proposed method not only can distinguish the damage type, but also it can accurately identify damage level.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Modified Low-Cycle Fatigue Estimation Using Machine Learning for Radius-Cut Coke-Shaped Metallic Damper Subjected to Cyclic Loading,2020,['Plastic hinge · Passive damper · Low-cycle fatigue · Machine learning'],,"In this study, a coke-shaped steel damper that exhibits in-plane resistance is introduced as a passive damper. The double-coke damper presented in this study applies the concept of reduced beam sections to increase the ductility in the case of a prolonged earthquake. Multiplastic hinges are placed on each strip by setting the radius-cut section. The fatigue performance of the damper during earthquake loading is verified through a constant cyclic loading test. The results indicate that, as the number of plastic hinges inside the strip increases, the damper ductility increases, producing a stable hysteresis graph. In addition, a new equation that considers the damage index using parameters such as maximum strength and effective stiffness is proposed, and the experimental results are found to be in excellent agreement with the number of failure cycles obtained from the proposed model. By comparing the results of applying the proposed equation with the machine learning results, it is demonstrated that machine learning can be used for estimating the damper performance against the fatigue of the resistive cycle.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv
Prediction of Chronic Disease-Related Inpatient Prolonged Length of Stay Using Machine Learning Algorithms,2020,"['Length of Stay', 'Chronic Disease', 'Inpatients', 'Machine Learning', 'Discharge Planning']",,"Objectives: The study aimed to develop and compare predictive models based on supervised machine learning algorithms for predicting the prolonged length of stay (LOS) of hospitalized patients diagnosed with five different chronic conditions.Methods: An administrative claim dataset (2008–2012) of a regional network of nine hospitals in the Tampa Bay area, Florida, USA, was used to develop the prediction models. Features were extracted from the dataset using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Five learning algorithms, namely, decision tree C5.0, linear support vector machine (LSVM), k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and multi-layered artificial neural networks, were used to build the model with semi-supervised anomaly detection and two feature selection methods. Issues with the unbalanced nature of the dataset were resolved using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). Results:LSVM with wrapper feature selection performed moderately well for all patient cohorts. Using SMOTE to counter data imbalances triggered a tradeoff between the model’s sensitivity and specificity, which can be masked under a similar area under the curve. The proposed aggregate rank selection approach resulted in a balanced performing model compared to other criteria. Finally, factors such as comorbidity conditions, source of admission, and payer types were associated with the increased risk of a prolonged LOS. Conclusions: Prolonged LOS is mostly associated with pre-intraoperative clinical and patient socio-economic factors. Accurate patient identification with the risk of prolonged LOS using the selected model can provide hospitals a better tool for planning early discharge and resource allocation, thus reducing avoidable hospitalization costs.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

A multivariate linear regression model is developed and trained with device parameter data (as input) and current imbalance data (as label). Each of the training devices is successively paralleled with one reference device to generate the current imbalance (label) data. Devices with close values of current imbalance when individually paralleled with the reference device are expected to have relatively balanced current sharing when paralleled among themselves. This model is trained with 40 devices and tested with 20 devices. The model shows accuracies of 87.93% and 97.48% in predicting transient and steady state current imbalances, respectively. These accuracy values are obtained by comparing the model's prediction for the 20 testing devices with the actual current imbalance values when these devices are paralleled with a reference device. Based on current imbalance predictions made by these models, the devices are grouped into classes for paralleling applications. The selection of devices for paralleling based on predictions from these models result in a satisfactorily balanced current distribution.

However, performing MD simulations is possible only when interatomic potentials are available and constructing such interatomic potentials usually requires additional computational work. Recently, generating interatomic potentials was shown to be much easier when machine learning (ML) algorithms were used. In addition, ML algorithms require new descriptors for improved performance. Here, we present an ML approach with several categories of atomic descriptors to predict the parameters necessary for MD simulations, such as the potential energies and the atomic forces.

Moreover, we observe fewer descriptors that perform better in predicting the potential energies and the forces during methane activation processes on a catalytic Pt(111) surface. These results were consistently observed in two different ML algorithms: fully-connected neural network (FNN) and XGBoost.

Clustering was employed to determine the household spending patterns. Moreover, the different household spending patterns before and after the regulation were comparatively studied. The patterns of consumers' choice of retail stores and shopping baskets by the type of retailers, derived from the respective datasets before and after the regulation, were compared to analyze the effects of the regulation. Results –After the regulation, some consumers who used to shop at large retailers before the regulation changed their shopping places to small retailers. However, the product categories that consumers had mainly purchased before the regulation were rarely changed even after the regulation.

Developmental dyslexia detection using machine learning techniques : A survey,2020,['DyslexiaMachine learningSurveyEEG'],,"Developmental dyslexia is a learning disability that occurs mostly in children during their early childhood. Dyslexic children face difficulties while reading, spelling and writing words despite having average or above-average intelligence. As a consequence, dyslexic children often suffer from negative feelings, such as low self-esteem, frustration, and anger. Therefore, early detection of dyslexia is very important to support dyslexic children right from the start. Researchers have proposed a wide range of techniques to detect developmental dyslexia, which includes game-based techniques, reading and writing tests, facial image capture and analysis, eye tracking, Magnetic reasoning imaging (MRI) and Electroencephalography (EEG) scans.

Furthermore, they are extremely nonlinear phenomena that are complex to analyze. Therefore, a classification-based real-time flood prediction model for urban areas is constructed in this study, by combining a numerical analysis model based on hydraulic theory with a machine learning model. Flood databases are constructed in advance for different rainfall scenarios using the Environmental Protection Agency–Storm Water Management Model (EPA-SWMM) and a two-dimensional inundation model. The flood depth data for each map grid are divided into five categories based on the average flood depth using the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and probabilistic neural network (PNN) classification techniques for higher-precision flood range prediction. A model is constructed to predict the representative cumulative volume if the observed rainfall is entered. For spatial expansion of the flood depth with the predicted representative cumulative volume, a system capable of generating a real-time flood map is constructed by linking the cumulative volume of each grid with the representative cumulative volume using linear and nonlinear regression. When compared with the results of a verified two-dimensional (2D) flood model, the developed-model goodness-of-fit is 85%, with a required run time of 1 min 12 s.

Sentiment analysis is one of opinion mining techniques to identify and extract subjective information from text using natural language processing and can be used to classify the sentiment of product reviews or comments. Since sentiment can be classified as either positive or negative, it can be considered one of the general classification problems. For sentiment analysis, the text must be converted into a language that can be recognized by a computer. Therefore, text such as a word or document is transformed into a vector in natural language processing called word embedding. Various techniques, such as Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec are used as word embedding techniques. Until now, there have not been many studies on word embedding techniques suitable for emotional analysis. In this study, among various word embedding techniques, Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec are used to compare and analyze the performance of movie review sentiment analysis.

Improving Data Quality of Low-cost IoT Sensors in Environmental Monitoring Networks Using Data Fusion and Machine Learning Approach,2020,['Internet of Things (ioT)Machine learningData fusionFeature selectionEnvironmental monitoring'],,"Environmental monitoring has become an active research area due to the current rise in the global climate change crises. Current environmental monitoring solutions, however, are characterized by high cost of acquisition and complexity of installation; often requiring extensive resources, infrastructure and expertise. It is infeasible to achieve with these solutions, high density in-situ networks such as are required to build refined scale models to facilitate robust monitoring, thus, leaving large gaps within the collected dataset. Low-Cost Sensors (LCS) can offer high-resolution spatiotemporal measurements which could be used to supplement existing dataset from current environmental monitoring solutions. LCS however, require frequent calibration in order to provide accurate and reliable data as they are often affected by environmental conditions when deployed on the field. Calibrating LCS can help to improve their data quality and ensure they are collecting accurate data. Achieving effective calibration, however, requires identifying factors that affect sensor’s data quality for a given measurement. This study evaluates the performance of three Feature Selection (FS) algorithms including Forward Feature Selection (FFS), Backward Elimination (BE) and Exhaustive Feature Selection (EFS) in identifying factors that affect data quality of low-cost IoT sensors in environmental monitoring networks. Applying the concept of data fusion, sensors data were merged with environmental factors and integrated into a single calibration equation to calibrate cairclipO3/NO2 and cairclipNO2 sensors using Linear Regression (LR) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The study showed the effectiveness of calibration in improving low-cost IoT sensor data quality and also demonstrated the convenience of feature selection and the ability of data fusion to provide more consistent, accurate and reliable information for calibration models. The analysis showed that the cairclipO3/NO2 sensor provided measurements that have good correlation with reference measurements whereas the cairclipNO2 sensor showed no reasonable correlation with the reference data. Calibrating the cairclipO3/NO2 yielded good improvement in its measurement outputs when compared to reference measurements (R2=0.83).

Practical Vitamin D Supplementation Using Machine Learning,2020,['Breast neoplasms · Osteoporosis · Vitamin D'],,"Background: Patients with breast cancer are at increased risk of developing osteoporosis. Maintaining normal levels of vitamin D may decrease the risk of osteoporosis, and vitamin D levels must be corrected in patients who develop osteoporosis before beginning bone modifying agents. Therefore, it is important to correct insufficient vitamin D levels in a timely manner. In clinical practice, current guidelines for replacement regimens often fail to rapidly correct vitamin D levels. The goal of this study was to review data in order to predict what replacement regimen(s) were most effective at repleting vitamin D levels. Methods: For this retrospective cohort study, data was collected from medical records of 2,164 female patients with breast cancer with Institutional Review Board approval. Total level change per week was the primary outcome and was compared for the most commonly used vitamin D replacement regimens adjusted for age, race, body mass index, creatinine clearance, endocrine therapy, and initial level. Results: Higher weekly doses of vitamin D supplementation had a more significant impact on the rate of correction compared to lower daily doses. Generalized linear model was used to develop an online calculator that predicts time to vitamin D level correction adjusted for significant patient characteristics for 5 common replacement regimens as well as no intervention. Conclusions: When choosing a vitamin D replacement regimen for patients with vitamin D deficiency, we recommend clinicians use the online calculator to ensure that the chosen regimen will enable the patient to reach vitamin D sufficiency in a timely manner.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

By 2020, it will enter the era of the fourth industrial revolution. Our older generation must live in the midst of the fourth industrial revolution led by young people. From 2015, the era of the 4th industrial revolution, a production system based on cyber physical systems, began. The Internet of Things era is to create a flexible and efficient production system by connecting humans and machines. Convenience, diversity and originality are the most important spirits of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. How can Buddhism contribute to humans seeking convenience through concentration and reflection? Buddhism easily embraces a diversity that acknowledges everything. Buddhists will be able to lead and live the 4th Industrial Revolution easily. The core of the 4th industry is machine and human, but it is based on meditation such as concentration and reflection. The life of Buddhists can be harmonized with the 4th Industrial Revolution and live in harmony with the organization and society. The main core technologies that lead the 4th industrial revolution are physics, digital, and biology. Physics is connected to unmanned transportation, robotics, 3D printing, and new materials. Digital is connected to the Internet of Things and blockchain. Biology is linked to genetics, gene editing, and synthetic biology. The national safety management paradigm is also changing by the 4th industrial revolution. So far, the national safety 1.0 system is the center of disaster acceptance and recovery. Responding to disasters, the national safety 2.0 system is the focus of on-site response. The national safety that prepares for disaster preparedness based on ICT is version 3.0. In the future, it is not a disaster caused by disaster prevention, but rather a disaster that will occur in the future. The future system is to comprehensively manage disaster risk for each process such as prediction, risk assessment, and reduction activities. In terms of our health, it is the same as the 3.0 version of National Safety. Until now, the disease had to appear to treat the disease, but in the future, it will go to a paradigm that prevents the disease and leads a healthy life that does not lead to illness.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Robust URL Phishing Detection Based on Deep Learning,2020,"['Phishing Detection', 'Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning', 'Convolutional Neural Network', 'CNN', 'Cyber Security']",,"Phishing websites can have devastating effects on governmental, financial, and social services, as well as on individual privacy. Currently, many phishing detection solutions are evaluated using small datasets and, thus, are prone to sampling issues, such as representing legitimate websites by only high-ranking websites, which could make their evaluation less relevant in practice. Phishing detection solutions which depend only on the URL are attractive, as they can be used in limited systems, such as with firewalls. In this paper, we present a URL-only phishing detection solution based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The proposed CNN takes the URL as the input, rather than using predetermined features such as URL length. For training and evaluation, we have collected over two million URLs in a massive URL phishing detection (MUPD) dataset. We split MUPD into training, validation and testing datasets. The proposed CNN achieves approximately 96% accuracy on the testing dataset; this accuracy is achieved with URL schemes (such as HTTP and HTTPS) removed from the URL. Our proposed solution achieved better accuracy compared to an existing state-of-the-art URL-only model on a published dataset. Finally, the results of our experiment suggest keeping the CNN up-to-date for better results in practice.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

This study performed the analysis of ADRs from nursing notes for drug safety surveillance using the temporal difference method in reinforcement learning (TD learning). Methods: Nursing notes of 8,316 patients (4,158 ADR and 4,158 non-ADR cases) admitted to Ajou University Hospital were used for the ADR classification task. A TD(λ) model was used to estimate state values for indicating the ADR risk. For the TD learning, each nursing phrase was encoded into one of seven states, and the state values estimated during training were employed for the subsequent testing phase. We applied logistic regression to the state values from the TD(λ) model for the classification task. Results: The overall accuracy of TD-based logistic regression of 0.63 was comparable to that of two machine-learning methods (0.64 for a naïve Bayes classifier and 0.63 for a support vector machine), while it outperformed two deep learning-based methods (0.58 for a text convolutional neural network and 0.61 for a long short-term memory neural network). Most importantly, it was found that the TD-based method can estimate state values according to the context of nursing phrases. Conclusions: TD learning is a promising approach because it can exploit contextual, time-dependent aspects of the available data and provide an analysis of the severity of ADRs in a fully incremental manner.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

This subjective information can be stated in different ways, such as feedback, discussions, blogs, podcasts, and video logs. This type of information generated by the empowered customers is known as user-generated content, which is traditionally in the form of words. The analysis was performed on a huge number of words using Natural Language Processing (NLP), which is a Unimodal Sentiment Analysis. With the rapid growth in the usage of the Internet, social media turned out to be a platform to share the thoughts of the individuals. This caused researchers to migrate from the traditional Unimodal analysis to Multimodal Sentiment Analysis, which includes video, audio, and images. This approach leverages the use of emotion and content and helps identify the scope and polarity of an individual’s sentiment. With the latest deep learning algorithms, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis can solve the problem of sarcasm identification. Multi-Modal Sentiment Analysis generates more accurate results compared to Uni Modal Sentiment Analysis. Therefore, this study aimed to define Sentiment Analysis and review the approaches and techniques in Sentiment Analysis from conventional Unimodal to Multimodal. In addition, this paper discusses a Multimodal Sentiment Analysis architecture using a transformers attention net.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Efficient genomic selection using ensemble learning and ensemble feature reduction,2020,"['Genomic selection', 'Machine learning', 'Rice', 'Dimensionality reduction']",,"Genomic selection (GS) is a popular breeding method that uses genome-wide markers to predict plant phenotypes. Empirical studies and simulations have shown that GS can greatly accelerate the breeding cycle, beyond what is possible with traditional quantitative trait locus (QTL) approaches. GS is a regression problem, where one often uses SNPs to predict the phenotypes. Since the SNP data are extremely high-dimensional, of the order of 100 K dimensions, it is difficult to make accurate phenotypic predictions. Moreover, finding the optimal prediction model is computationally very costly. Out of thousands of SNPs, usually only a few influence a particular phenotypic trait. We first of all show how ensemble-based regression techniques give better prediction accuracy compared to traditional regression methods, which have been used in existing papers. We then further improve the prediction accuracy by using an ensemble of feature selection and feature extraction techniques, which also reduces the time to compute the regression model parameters. We predict three traits: grain yield, time to 50% flowering and plant height for which the existing methods give an accuracy of 0.304, 0.627 and 0.341, respectively. Our proposed regression model gives an accuracy of 0.330, 0.674 and 0.458 for these traits. Additionally, we also propose a computationally efficient regression model that reduces the computation time by as much as 90% and gives an accuracy of 0.342, 0.580 and 0.411, respectively.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv
EEMD assisted supervised learning for the fault diagnosis of BLDC motor using vibration signal,2020,['· Condition monitoring · Continuous wavelet transform · Ensemble empirical mode decomposition · Fault diagnosis · Principal component analysis'],,"Predictive maintenance (PdM) has become a major issue in system health monitoring, as machines are operating under more complex and diverse conditions nowadays.Besides minimizing the risk of a catastrophic failure, a proper maintenance scheme can amplify system yield as well as largely reduce production and maintenance costs. This paper presents a comprehensive study of a permanent magnet brushless DC (BLDC) motor’s fault diagnosis using vibration signals. Based on the degree of deviation from the normal operating condition, three health states are chosen from the entire lifecycle of motor. Acquired signals are decomposed using ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and the appropriate intrinsic mode function (IMF) is selected based on the similarity index. Later, selected IMF is analyzed in time-frequency domain by using continuous wavelet transform (CWT) for better localization of fault frequencies. Several statistical features that indicate the health state of the motor are also extracted to diagnose different fault states. Later, feature dimensions were reduced using principal component analysis (PCA) technique and classified using a supervised machine learning technique named k-nearest neighbor (KNN). Extracted IMF from EEMD provides significant fault related information to detect and diagnose different fault states. Proposed method is effectively used to diagnose fault at the incipient stage as well as classify different fault states at incipient stage and severe stage.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Prediction of DMFT index is an important basis for the development of public oral health care projects and strategies for caries prevention. In this study, we used data from the 2015 Korean children’s oral health survey to predict DMFT index and caries risk groups using statistical techniques and four different machine-learning algorithms.Methods: DMFT prediction models were constructed using multiple linear regression and four different machine-learning algorithms: decision tree regressor, decision tree classifier (DTC), random forest regressor, and random forest classifier (RFC). Thereafter, their accuracies were compared.Results: For the DMFT predictive model, the prediction accuracy of multiple linear regression and RFC were 15.24% and 43.27%, respectively. The accuracy of DTC prediction was 2.84 times that of multiple linear regression. The important feature of the machine-learning model, which predicts DMFT index and the caries risk group, was the number of teeth with sealants.Conclusions: Using data from the 2015 Korean children’s oral health survey, which is considered big data in the field of oral health survey in Korea, this study confirmed that machine-learning models are more useful than statistical models for predicting DMFT index and caries risk in 12-yearold children.

RFID and NFC systems that we know are also being used by applying automatic recognition technology. RFID systems have evolved to replace existing barcode systems in a variety of areas that can be utilized as automatic recognition technologies. The biggest problem with today's RFID-enabled auto-recognition systems is the conflict between the leader and the tag that occurs when sharing the radio spectrum. Collision occurs when a tag within the recognition distance sends a signal to the reader simultaneously. If multiple tags are present in the RFID system and want to be recognized at the same time, the recognition performance of the tags will be significantly reduced and the recognition system will be able to recognize them. Causes performance problems. In other words, collision arbitration is aimed at fast and reliable recognition between RFID readers and tags, so it must be done without fail. It's a necessary skill. Existing studies use a variety of complex multi-connection technologies and collision prevention algorithms to mediate conflicts between tags. The anti-collision algorithm between leader and tag proposed in this paper used mechanical learning used in artificial intelligence.

Since the value of MBS issued through securitization of mortgage loans is critically affected by changes in cash flows of underlying assets (mortgage loans), it is important for both issuers and investors to predict the prepayment rate of underlying assets in an MBS pool. Therefore, we construct the prediction model for MBS prepayment rates using machine learning algorithm and compares the predictive power between either distinct machine learning models or predictor variable sets.To be specific, we compared the predictive power of the conventional model with the machine learning algorithm using variables such as mortgage interest rate spread and housing market factors, which were representatively used in the existing studies. In addition, by analyzing the model that adds the additional variables related to the attributes of underlying assets and the market condition variables at the time of issuance of MBS, we investigated how the predictive power varies according to the use of the predictor variables. Ridge Regression, LASSO, and Elastic net model were employed for each predictor variable set. To compare the prediction accuracy between those models and choose the optimal model, we embedded the model selection process in the algorithm so that the optimal model was selected based on the data.The results of the analysis suggested that Elastic net model shows the best prediction performance. Moreover, the prediction performance was maximized with the predictor variable including the variables related to the underlying assets, such as LTV, DTI, interest rates etc.This study is different from the existing machine learning research in that it builds data-driven process of selection for optimal variables, optimal models, and optimal parameters into the algorithm.

The study also investigates the applicability and capability of a machine learning methods such as a generalized regression neural network (GRNN) for predicting PM2.5 and NOX generations.METHODS : To analyze the characteristics of PM2.5 and NOX generations at roadsides, data acquisition was conducted in a specific segment of roads, and PM2.5 and NOX prediction models were estimated using GLM. In addition, to investigate the applicability and capability of a machine learning methods, PM2.5 and NOX prediction models were estimated using a GRNN and were compared with models employing previously estimated GLMs using r-square, mean absolute deviation (MAD), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and root mean square error (RMSE) as parameters.RESULTS : Results revealed that relative humidity, wind speed, and traffic volume were significant for both PM2.5 and NOX prediction models based on estimated models from a GLM. In addition, to compare the applicability and capability of the GLM and GRNN models (i.e., PM2.5 and NOX prediction models), the GRNN model of PM2.5 and NOX prediction was found to yield better statistical significance for r-square, MAD, MAPE, and RMSE as compared with the same parameters used in the GLM.CONCLUSIONS : Analytical results indicated that a higher relative humidity and traffic volume could lead to higher PM2.5 and NOX concentrations. By contrast, lower wind speed could affect higher PM2.5 and NOX concentrations at roadsides.

Therefore, this study seeks to achieve more objective results and research efficiency by utilizing machine learning among artificial intelligence technologies that have been applied to various studies recently. The subjects of the study are limited to the cover and the first section of music textbooks for the third and fourth graders(nine types per grade, 18 volumes in total) according to revised music curriculum of 2015. As one of the machine learning techniques, K-mean Clustering in this research classifies the top 10 colors in the textbooks, and the HEX codes are converted to NCS codes through our proposed color conversion method.In this study, the results are as follows; First, regardless of the name of each chapter, textbooks, which consist of four to six chapters, only consider four season-related colors and images for music education. Second, chapter in the textbooks mostly uses colors and nuances of the GY(Green Yellow) and YR(Yellow Red), the neutral color scale and low-color chroma. Furthermore, the results show that the color of the cover for each chapter is mainly used as an accent or a dominant color, which is highly related to the text of each chapter this research focuses on. That is, although there are differences in colors in textbooks for each publisher, most of them set color images of each chapter and reflect them throughout the chapters to maintain color consistency in each chapter. However, given the importance of child color experience, various changes in the use and chroma of different colors are required. Lastly, this study also suggests that rather than fixed color images on a seasonal basis, it is more effective for music education to present the illustrations and colors matching the music score.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Through correlation analysis, valid variables were selected and meaningless variables were excluded. To reflect changes over time, dependent variables at baseline were treated as independent variables at later time points. The relationship between independent variables and the dependent variable after n point was subjected to Pearson correlation analysis.Results: The correlation (R2) was strongest after 3 hours, which was adopted as a dependent variable. According to root mean square error (RMSE) data, the proposed method was superior to the other machine learning methods.

We randomly divided the data into a training set (1,000) and test set (368). Five machine learning methods, i.e., support vector machine model, lasso logit model, naïve bayes, discriminant analysis, and K-nearest neighbor (KNN), with a 10-cross fold technique were used with the proposed model to predict OSA. We evaluated the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision of each model for three thresholds [Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI)≥5, AHI≥15, and AHI≥30]. Results: Among the machine learning techniques, KNN showed the best results compared to the other techniques. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision of OSA prediction were 87.0%, 91.0%, 74.4%, and 91.9%, respectively, based on AHI≥5. When the threshold of OSA was AHI≥15 or AHI≥30, KNN provided lower accuracy (79.6% each) and precision (79.0% and 68.7%), which were still higher than those of the other techniques.

From this perspective, the domestic real estate market has continuously developed behavioral economics research to explain the behavior of economic players in the housing market since the early 2000s.

Since the student uses the reflection notes, essays, and testimonials generated during the character education process, there is no need for separate evaluation tools or time and space resources. In addition, automation that makes use of machine learning enables easy extraction of changes over time, regardless of the number of employees. Therefore, it is possible to compare personality values between groups and to compare numbers within groups, which can be used as data for screening individuals or groups requiring consultation or in-depth investigation. This study can be used as a sort of dictionary for in-depth interviews by finding out singularities through the quantification of individual changes over time. In other words, it is possible to know the change of the learner's positive and negative attitude over time, which in turn can be used as data in order to examine in detail data pertaining to the date when the negative index is high. As an example of another method of use, it is possible to compare personality values between groups, or to compare individual figures within groups, and to use them as data for screening individuals or groups requiring consultation or in-depth investigation. At the beginning of the study, we started with the assumption that people can be viewed as possessing both positive and negative aspects. However, if an algorithm is developed that understands humans more deeply, we can evaluate various virtues of humanity in much greater detail.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

PCA anomaly detection to identify time rows as normal or abnormal was suggested by converting subjects identification problem to time domain. CNN image classification was suggested to identify the failure time by re-structuring of time series data, which computed the correlation matrix of one minute data and converted to tiff image format. Also, LASSO, one of feature selection methods, was applied to select the most affecting variables which could identify the failure status. For the empirical study, time series data was collected in seconds from a power generator of 214 components for 25 minutes including 20 minutes before the failure time. The failure time was predicted and detected 9 minutes 17 seconds before the failure time by PCA anomaly detection, but was not detected by the combination of LASSO and PCA because the target variable was binary variable which was assigned on the base of the failure time.

The data used in the analysis totaled 10,545 rows, consisting of 160 columns including 38 in the statement of financial position, 26 in the statement of comprehensive income, 11 in the statement of cash flows, and 76 in the index of financial ratios. Unlike most previous prior studies used the default event as the basis for learning about default risk, this study calculated default risk using the market capitalization and stock price volatility of each company based on the Merton model. Through this, it was able to solve the problem of data imbalance due to the scarcity of default events, which had been pointed out as the limitation of the existing methodology, and the problem of reflecting the difference in default risk that exists within ordinary companies. Because learning was conducted only by using corporate information available to unlisted companies, default risks of unlisted companies without stock price information can be appropriately derived. Through this, it can provide stable default risk assessment services to unlisted companies that are difficult to determine proper default risk with traditional credit rating models such as small and medium-sized companies and startups. Although there has been an active study of predicting corporate default risks using machine learning recently, model bias issues exist because most studies are making predictions based on a single model. Stable and reliable valuation methodology is required for the calculation of default risk, given that the entitys default risk information is very widely utilized in the market and the sensitivity to the difference in default risk is high. Also, Strict standards are also required for methods of calculation. The credit rating method stipulated by the Financial Services Commission in the Financial Investment Regulations calls for the preparation of evaluation methods, including verification of the adequacy of evaluation methods, in consideration of past statistical data and experiences on credit ratings and changes in future market conditions. This study allowed the reduction of individual models bias by utilizing stacking ensemble techniques that synthesize various machine learning models. This allows us to capture complex nonlinear relationships between default risk and various corporate information and maximize the advantages of machine learning-based default risk prediction models that take less time to calculate. To calculate forecasts by sub model to be used as input data for the Stacking Ensemble model, training data were divided into seven pieces, and sub-models were trained in a divided set to produce forecasts. To compare the predictive power of the Stacking Ensemble model, Random Forest, MLP, and CNN models were trained with full training data, then the predictive power of each model was verified on the test set. The analysis showed that the Stacking Ensemble model exceeded the predictive power of the Random Forest model, which had the best performance on a single model. Next, to check for statistically significant differences between the Stacking Ensemble model and the forecasts for each individual model, the Pair between the Stacking Ensemble model and each individual model was constructed. Because the results of the Shapiro-wilk normality test also showed that all Pair did not follow normality, Using the nonparametric method wilcoxon rank sum test, we checked whether the two model forecasts that make up the Pair showed statistically significant differences. The analysis showed that the forecasts of the Staging Ensemble model showed statistically significant differences from those of the MLP model and CNN model. In addition, this study can provide a methodology that allows existing credit rating agencies to apply machine learning-based bankruptcy risk prediction methodologies, given that traditional credit rating models can a",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

However, the process gives rise to a nonlinear temperature variation, which is difficult to predict using a traditional physics model. As an alternative, this study employed machine-learning technology to predict such temperature variation for the first time. Mg alloy was exposed to a single electropulse with a variety of pulse magnitudes and durations for this purpose. Nine machine-learning models were established from algorithms from artificial neural network (ANN), deep neural network (DNN), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The ANN models showed an insufficient predicting capability with respect to the region of peak temperature, where temperature varied most significantly. The DNN models were built by increasing model complexity, enhancing architectures, and tuning hyperparameters. They exhibited a remarkable improvement in predicting capability at the heating-cooling boundary as well as overall estimation. As a result, the DNN-2 model in this group showed the best prediction of nonlinear temperature variation among the machinelearning models built in this study. The XGBoost model exhibited poor predicting performance when default hyperparameters were applied. However, hyperparameter tuning of learning rates and maximum depths resulted in a decent predicting capability with this algorithm.

Wildfires weaken the shear strength of the soil, forming a layer of soil that is vulnerable to landslides. It is important to identify the severity of a wildfire as well as the burned area to sustainably manage the forest. Although satellite remote sensing has been widely used to map wildfire severity, it is often difficult to determine the severity using only the temporal change of satellite-derived indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR).In this study, we proposed an approach for determining wildfire severity based on machine learning through the synergistic use of Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar-C data and Sentinel-2A Multi Spectral Instrument data.

The results showed that the random forest model yielded the best performance, resulting in an overall accuracy of 82.3%. The cross-site validation to examine the spatiotemporal transferability of the machine learning models showed that the models were highly sensitive to temporal differences between the training and validation sites, especially in the early growing season. This implies that a more robust model with high spatiotemporal transferability can be developed when more wildfire cases with different seasons and areas are added in the future.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

In particular, the next-generation industries represented by artificial intelligence (AI) are presenting a future of unpredictable forms that have no historical origin.When countries are busy with social and institutional rearrangements for technological innovation in order to survive the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it is necessary to discuss what problems the copyright sector has and how to solve it.

텍스트 분류 기반 기계학습의 정신과 진단 예측 적용,2020,,,"Objectives The aim was to find effective vectorization and classification models to predict a psychiatric diagnosis from text-based medical records. Methods Electronic medical records (n = 494) of present illness were collected retrospectively in inpatient admission notes with three diagnoses of major depressive disorder, type 1 bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Data were split into 400 training data and 94 independent validation data. Data were vectorized by two different models such as term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and Doc2vec. Machine learning models for classification including stochastic gradient descent, logistic regression, support vector classification, and deep learning (DL) were applied to predict three psychiatric diagnoses. Five-fold cross-validation was used to find an effective model. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were measured for comparison between the models. Results Five-fold cross-validation in training data showed DL model with Doc2vec was the most effective model to predict the diagnosis (accuracy = 0.87, F1-score = 0.87). However, these metrics have been reduced in independent test data set with final working DL models (accuracy = 0.79, F1-score = 0.79), while the model of logistic regression and support vector machine with Doc2vec showed slightly better performance (accuracy = 0.80, F1-score = 0.80) than the DL models with Doc2vec and others with TF-IDF. Conclusions The current results suggest that the vectorization may have more impact on the performance of classification than the machine learning model. However, data set had a number of limitations including small sample size, imbalance among the category, and its generalizability. With this regard, the need for research with multi-sites and large samples is suggested to improve the machine learning models.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

To accomplish the requirement, the network manager performs graph construction and resource allocation about network topology, and determines the transmission cycle and path of each node in advance. However, this network management scheme cannot treat mobile devices that cause continuous topology changes because graph reconstruction and resource reallocation should be performed as network topology changes. That is, despite the growing need of mobile devices in many industries, existing scheme cannot adequately respond to path failure caused by movement of mobile device and packet loss in the process of path recovery. To solve this problem, a network management scheme is required to prevent packet loss caused by mobile devices. Thus, we analyse the location and movement cycle of mobile devices over time using machine learning for predicting the mobility pattern. In the proposed scheme, the network manager could prevent the problems caused by mobile devices through performing graph construction and resource allocation for the predicted network topology based on the movement pattern. Performance evaluation results show a prediction rate of about 86% compared with actual movement pattern, and a higher packet delivery ratio and a lower resource share compared to existing scheme.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Because workpieces used for large aircrafts parts are expensive and require strict processing quality, a maintenance plan is required to minimize the deterioration of the workpiece quality that can be caused by unexpected abnormalities of the tool and take maintenance measures at an earlier stage that does not adversely affect the machining. In this paper, we propose a method to indirectly monitor the tool condition that can affect the machining quality of large aircraft parts through real-time monitoring of the current signal applied to the spindle motor during machining by comparing whether the monitored current shows an abnormal pattern during actual machining by using this as a reference pattern. First, 30 types of tools are used for machining large aircraft parts, and three tools with relatively frequent breakages among these tools were selected as monitoring targets by reflecting the opinions of processing experts in the field. Second, when creating the CNC machining program, the M code, which is a CNC auxiliary function, is inserted at the starting and ending positions of the tool to be monitored using the editing tool, so that monitoring start and end times can be notified. Third, the monitoring program was run with the M code signal notified from the CNC controller by using the DAQ (Data Acquisition) device, and the machine learning algorithms for detecting abnormality of the current signal received in real time could be used to determine whether there was an abnormality. Fourth, through the implementation of the prototype system, the feasibility of the method proposed in this paper was shown and verified through an actual example.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Whilst a high gain disturbance observer could estimate the system states and the external disturbance successfully, the high gain of the observer can cause problems in the presence of the measurement noise. When measurement noise exists in the output, fault detection methods based on the estimated states may often result in false alarms. To solve the problem, this paper designs an adaptive DOB using Deep Q-Network (DQN) which is one of reinforcement learning algorithms. For the proposed observer design, this paper explains the definitions of the state, the action, and the reward for the reinforcement learning.

Predictive performance is the most important in a game prediction model. However, statistical and machine learning models show different optimal performance depending on the characteristics of the data used for learning. In this paper, we propose a new ensemble model to predict English Premier League soccer games using statistical models and the machine learning models which showed good performance in predicting the results of the soccer games and this model is possible to select a model that performs best when predicting the data even if the data are different.

AI is one of the materials in animation, but it already serves various uses in human life. Adobe Photoshop added machine learning-applied functions in 2014. Today there are many software programs applying machine learning in various fields including image synthesis and video editing. The computer is used in almost every stage of the animation production process these days, which raised a need to understand the concept of AI and examine and arrange AI-based software functions in the viewpoint of users instead of developers. The investigator thus arranged the basics and examined the ways that they were applied to software by making use of the images and concept diagrams made by himself so that any people could understand them.The findings show that Adobe Photoshop encompassed most of the various software functions based on AI in the field of image synthesis. In the field of video editing, Premiere featured completely different functions not found in other AI-based video editing programs. Unlike other AI-based video editing programs designed to select videos according to given texts or music and make it easy for common people to use them for creative purposes, Premiere has a goal of professional video editing and image correction as a universal tool.Animation is an attractive work of video that adolescents and youths like, providing creative texts to depict the fast-evolving times. Those who are involved in the field of animation need to have an open mind and attitude to make efforts to apply something new to the entire process from planning to production. It is expected that more applications and platforms will be created capable of easy and fun creation based on AI. The production of animation has pursued the goal of creating storytelling video content. In the future, it will be important to employ a broader viewpoint to develop content in the forms of creative tools that anyone can enjoy including machine learning developers based on the planning abilities and production skills. The findings of the present study will hopefully contribute to the efforts to teach and learn the basic knowledge for these new works.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

It is true that methodologies based on these algorithms did not pay attention to inferences about the prediction error terms including the distribution assumptions. Recently, studies on prediction error and variance estimation for these methodologies have been actively conducted. This study examined the mean squared prediction error (MSPE) using the out of bag (OOB) method and bias. To adjust the bias, an estimation method using bootstrap was proposed and the efficiency was compared through simulation. Random forest was used as the machine learning methodology, and as a result of analysis, the proposed bias correction method was more efficient in simple polynomial models than in complex models.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv
Clinical applications and performance of intelligent systems in dental and maxillofacial radiology: A review,2020,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Deep Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Radiology']",,"Intelligent systems (i.e., artificial intelligence), particularly deep learning, are machines able to mimic the cognitive functions of humans to perform tasks of problem-solving and learning. This field deals with computational models that can think and act intelligently, like the human brain, and construct algorithms that can learn from data to make predictions. Artificial intelligence is becoming important in radiology due to its ability to detect abnormalities in radiographic images that are unnoticed by the naked human eye. These systems have reduced radiologists’ workload by rapidly recording and presenting data, and thereby monitoring the treatment response with a reduced risk of cognitive bias. Intelligent systems have an important role to play and could be used by dentists as an adjunct to other imaging modalities in making appropriate diagnoses and treatment plans. In the field of maxillofacial radiology, these systems have shown promise for the interpretation of complex images, accurate localization of landmarks, characterization of bone architecture, estimation of oral cancer risk, and the assessment of metastatic lymph nodes, periapical pathologies, and maxillary sinus pathologies. This review discusses the clinical applications and scope of intelligent systems such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and deep learning programs in maxillofacial imaging.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

So far, biotope maps study was a tendency to focus on the type of vegetation, naturalness, land use, landscape ecology theories. However, biotope related studies have not reflected the concept of animal habitat, which is a component of biotope, and that is the limitation of biotope map research. This study suggest a methodology to predict potential habitats for fauna using machine learning to quantify habitat values. The potential habitats of fauna were predicted by spatial statistics using machine learning, and the results were converted into species richness. For biotope type assessments, we classified biotope values into vegetation value and habitat value and evaluated them using a matrix for value summation. The vegetation value was divided into 5 stages based on vegetation nature and land use, and the habitat value was classified into five stages by predicting the species richness predicted by machine learning. This is meaningful because our research can positively reflect the results of field surveys of fauna that were negatively reflected in the evaluation of biotope types in the past. Therefore, in the future, if the biotope map manual is revised, our methodology should be applied.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

The proposed method selects an optimal model after a sensitivity experiment, and then performs verification with the observed wind speed. The sensitivity experiment targets the data extracted by applying the sliding window method and the set factor values of machine learning. The elements used in the learning materials are time, spatial and meteorological factors (temperature, wind direction, humidity, precipitation). The meteorological data used was the value of ASOS 95 sites provided by the Korea Meteorological Administration from August 2017 to August 2018.

The researchers adopted a complexity perspective to understand this whole process as a part of dynamic conceptual ecologies in evolution. Within this framework, an academic concept, being developed as part of practical reality in the related field, came to existence to obtain a discursive power, or “governmentality,” adopting Foucault’s terminology, which authorizes collective legitimacy to the piecemeal of the fragmented practices, and to provide them justification and social values. To reveal the characteristics, we used two major scholarly databases to select articles whose researches have mainly focused on the notion of  lifelong learning.  One is SCOPUS scholarly database, the other is Korean research database of RISS. From the two databases, we compared the distribution of the articles whose main theme is related with lifelong learning, both in Korea and overseas. Upon the data collected, we found out that (1) the expansivity and interconnectivity of lifelong learning discourses between various academic fields is far restricted in Korea than overseas; (2) lifelong learning in Korea is more strictly bound within the territory of educational researches, while in overseas more articles were found in the areas such as medicine, engineering, social science, humanities, and others; (3) newly emerging research themes were created especially in the areas of artificial intelligence and machine learning that were standing over the platform of Industry 4.0 or post-humanism. Overall, the notion of lifelong learning today came to be a general and transdisciplinary concept that shares more connectivity and alliances in collective researches to shed “new” lights on the “old” phenomena of human learning in a new epoch. Nevertheless, the conceptual sophistication and major upgrade have not been supported enough by the original adult education research group; rather, the clock of the concept stopped at the point when it was first invented. All kinds of cliche and old implications are repeated without further evolution.

The big data, which is actively used by the private sector, is also positively evaluated as a means of improving the efficiency of government agencies’ work and policy means. In particular, just as empirical research using traditional data is used as evidence for a policy, big data can be used in evidence-based decision making.

The similarity is measured by calculating the Euclidean distance of two output feature vectors. If the calculated similarity is less than the threshold, it is judged that two speakers are the same. The experimental result of the proposed speaker recognition based on the convolutional Siamese neural network showed its accuracy was achieved up to 96%.

Experiment on Intermediate Feature Coding for Object Detection and Segmentation,2020,"['Deep learning', 'intermediate features', 'video coding for machine', 'object detection', 'object segmentation']",,"With the recent development of deep learning, most computer vision-related tasks are being solved with deep learning-based network technologies such as CNN and RNN. Computer vision tasks such as object detection or object segmentation use intermediate features extracted from the same backbone such as Resnet or FPN for training and inference for object detection and segmentation. In this paper, an experiment was conducted to find out the compression efficiency and the effect of encoding on task inference performance when the features extracted in the intermediate stage of CNN are encoded. The feature map that combines the features of 256 channels into one image and the original image were encoded in HEVC to compare and analyze the inference performance for object detection and segmentation. Since the intermediate feature map encodes the five levels of feature maps (P2 to P6), the image size and resolution are increased compared to the original image. However, when the degree of compression is weakened, the use of feature maps yields similar or better inference results to the inference performance of the original image.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

This vibration data is also used to diagnose motor failures in machine learning. However, there are many types of electric motors used in the industry, and the environment can vary according to the proposed use. To diagnose motor failure, data must be collected, labeled, and learned. In this way, it is very difficult to collect and label vibration data in consideration of all situations. For example, in identical situations, even if only the sensor changes, the CNN-only algorithm can fail to classify the data. In this paper, a method of learning CNN with learning data created by automatically classifying and labeling data using K-means is proposed. To apply K-means to fault diagnosis, FFT data was divided by frequency. For each frequency, the K-means algorithm was applied to calculate the centroid. The training data was used to calculate the similarity and distance to the centroid of the classified clusters. Using the calculated results, the centroid classified as the K-means was reclassified as normal or fault. This method using the K-menas could classify data, even if various data were entered. Finally, CNN was trained using the generated training data. Using this process, the existing CNN-only algorithm failed to classify the data when the sensor was altered, but the proposed algorithm classified the data and showed high accuracy.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

This paper examines a machine learning-based modeling of the prediction of tomorrow’s PM10 concentration in the form of a gridded map using the AirKorea observations, Chinese cities’ air quality index, and NWP (numerical weather prediction) model data. A blind test using 23,048 cases in 2019 produced a correlation coefficient of 0.973 and an MAE (mean absolute error) of 4.097㎍/㎥, which is high accuracy due to the appropriate selection of input variables and the optimization of the machine learning model.

Automated Analysis Approach for the Detection of High Survivable Ransomware,2020,"['Ransomware', 'supervised machine learning', 'Support Vector Machine', 'Artificial Neural Network', 'Term Frequency-Inverse document frequency']",,"Ransomware is malicious software that encrypts the user-related files and data and holds them to ransom. Such attacks have become one of the serious threats to cyberspace. The avoidance techniques that ransomware employs such as obfuscation and/or packing makes it difficult to analyze such programs statically. Although many ransomware detection studies have been conducted, they are limited to a small portion of the attack's characteristics. To this end, this paper proposed a framework for the behavioral-based dynamic analysis of high survivable ransomware (HSR) with integrated valuable feature sets. Term Frequency-Inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) was employed to select the most useful features from the analyzed samples. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were utilized to develop and implement a machine learning-based detection model able to recognize certain behavioral traits of high survivable ransomware attacks. Experimental evaluation indicates that the proposed framework achieved an area under the ROC curve of 0.987 and a few false positive rates 0.007.

In this study, we explore the critical speech features for sentiment analysis. We modify our previous feature-generation method, which applies low-variance filtering and principal component analysis (for grouped features) to identify the features. We do not utilize between-class scatter here, but rather, the between class–scatter and within class–scatter ratio. Grouping is achieved according to the number of features—not correlation values. For an objective evaluation, we use the Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song, with a performance evaluation conducted in terms of classifier accuracy and computational complexity.

In particular, a voice phishing prediction method using the Fraud Detection System (FDS), which is being used to detect financial fraud, was studied based on the fact that the victim engaged in financial transaction activities (such as account transfers). As a result, it was conceptually derived to combine big data such as call details, messenger details, abnormal accounts, voice phishing type and 112 report related to voice phishing in machine learning-based Fraud Detection System(FDS).

Deepfakes rely on neural networks that analyze large sets of data samples to learn to mimic a person’s facial expressions, mannerisms, voice, and inflections. The process involves feeding footage of two people into a deep learning algorithm to train it to swap faces. In other words, deepfakes use facial mapping technology and AI(Artificial Intelligence) that swaps the face of a person on a video into the face of another person.  However, the tools and tactics of public sphere manipulation we are witnessing today are unprecedented. The unethical use of Big Data and machine learning to game the public sphere in pernicious ways marks a new point of departure. For example, through the intense level of surveillance of voters afforded through digital tools, AI allows political influence to move from public campaigns to private sentiment, a shift that repositions electoral politics from a spectacle that is overt to a script that is covert. Also, as the Internet has grown, so has misinformation. It is often claimed that we live in times of ‘post-truth’.  In this viewpoint, this dissertation inquires legal review of the status quo debate on theoretical access to the law-based argument of establishment and action and policy approach to the key issues in the related issues and the agenda concerned, which is concentrated on normalizing irregularity in post-truth created by deepfakes as types of images, videos, and audios.

The machine learning-based GNSS jamming classification scheme recently proposed in [17] requires a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) process and a binary black-and-white image processing process through image mapping of the obtained spectrogram. The average jamming classification accuracy of the conventional scheme is approximately 94.31%, where the maximum, average, and minimum classification accuracies for single frequency modulation (FM) jamming are as low as approximately 89.55%, 83.43%, and 77.61%, respectively. The major performance deterioration factor of the conventional scheme is information loss caused by the pre-processing for the designed machine learning technique. To tackle this problem, we construct a sophisticated convolutional neural network (CNN) that directly uses the IF sampled GNSS received signal without pre-processing the conventional scheme. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, the confusion matrix of the jamming classification between the conventional and the proposed schemes is compared and analyzed by Monte-Carlo simulation using 106 test samples in five representative jamming environments with no jamming. As a result of the simulation, the average jamming classification accuracy of the proposed scheme is approximately 99.41%, which improves the classification accuracy by 5.1% compared with that achieved by the conventional scheme.

This has led to continuous reports of cases of forest damage due to physiological stress, not pest damage. In 2014, pine trees were collectively damaged in the forest genetic resources reserve of Sogwang-ri, Uljin, South Korea. An investigation was launched to determine the causes of the dieback, so that a forest management plan could be prepared to deal with the current dieback, and to prevent future damage. This study aimedto 1) understand the topographic and structural characteristics of the area which experienced pine tree dieback, 2) identify the main causes of the dieback, and 3) predict future risk areas through the use of machine-learning techniques. A model for identifying risk areas was developed using 14 explanatory variables, including location, elevation, slope, and age class. When three machine-learning techniques-Decision Tree, Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were applied to the model, RF and SVM showed higher predictability scores, with accuracies over 93%. Our analysis of the variable set showed that the topographical areas most vulnerable to pine dieback were those with high altitudes, high daily solar radiation, and limited water availability. We also found that, when it came to forest stand characteristics, pine trees with high vertical stand densities (5-15 m high) and higher age classes experienced a higher risk of dieback. The RF and SVM models predicted that 9.5% or 115 ha of the Geumgang Pine Forest are at high risk for pine dieback.

This study predicts opponent move using match data of a real-time strategy game named ClashRoyale and a multi-label classification based on machine learning. In the initial experiment, binary card properties, binary card coordinates, and normalized time information are input, and card type and card coordinates are predicted using random forest and multi-layer perceptron. Subsequently, experiments were conducted sequentially using the next three data preprocessing methods. First, some property information of the input data were transformed. Next, input data were converted to nested form considering the consecutive card input system. Finally, input data were predicted by dividing into the early and the latter according to the normalized time information.

RSSI emitted from a beacon can be utilized to measure the distance between smart mobile objects that are moving indoors. However, reflection and diffraction phenomena that affect RSSI often result in inaccurate distance measurements. In this paper, multilateral machine learning algorithms are applied to enhance the accuracy of distance measurements based on RSSI. First, a low-pass filter is used to correct estimates that overshoot among the measured RSSI data. Second, a parameter control leaning method is used and the distance translation equation is supplied with corrected RSSI data. Although this equation can predict distance from the strength of the RSSI signal it can generate errors when it comes to the range of the distances estimated. To reduce these range of distance errors, a back propagation neural network algorithm is applied. For performance evaluation, we compare the actual distance values with the estimated distance values that come from each stage during the multilateral machine learning. The estimated values were found to be close to the actual distances within the limited scope of distances tested, as such, we believe this technology can contribute to location awareness service applications in IoT networks.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

It is a program for advice in the field of law that many people want without being complicated, such as real estate lease, labor, etc., but it is still in its infancy in many ways. Efforts to increase the efficiency of the system and to advance the algorithm are expected to lead to good results.These chatbots are somewhat different from general AI algorithms such as machine learning, but they are the same in terms of AI algorithms that produce a certain result through an automated calculation process based on data collected from users. Personal information issues inevitably arise during processing such as processing.The recent entry into force of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the EU has placed significant restrictions on the development and operation of artificial intelligence algorithms. The above regulations have various regulations for the protection of personal information. These regulations are applied to all artificial intelligence algorithms, and if they do not comply properly, they are subject to tremendous penalties.This is a critical issue that is directly related to the life and death of the management company.In addition to the protection of such personal information, depending on the type of chatbot, it may be related to advertisement regulation, and the remedy for damages that occurred during the use of the chatbot, or the validity of transactions in the case of e-commerce using the chatbot, is also a problem. Whether or not legal services are allowed is a question of whether lawyer law is violated.In this paper, various legal issues will be examined in connection with not only the chatbot algorithm but also general AI algorithms comparable to those.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

A method that has gained much interest is to use image segmentation, from which statistical features are derived and analyzed by machine learning. Recently, deep learning has been adopted in this area. However, image segmentation is still a difficult task to achieve stable performance due to a variety of environmental variations. The end-to-end learning in neural network has a demerit that train images may be different from real images acquired in outdoor fields. To solve these problems, we propose superpixel-based disease classification method using end-to-end CNN (convolutional neural network) learning. Based on experiments performed on PlantVillage apple images, the classification accuracy is 98.29% and 92.43% for full-image and superpixel. As well, the multivariate F1-score is (0.98, 0.93).

It is important to predict floods in urban areasthat have suffered inundation in the past. For flood prediction, not only numerical analysis models but also machine learning–basedmodels can be applied. The LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network used in this study is appropriate for sequence data, butit demands a lot of data. However, rainfall that causes flooding does not appear every year in a single urban basin, meaning it is difficultto collect enough data for deep learning. Therefore, in addition to the rainfall observed in the study area, the observed rainfall in anotherurban basin was applied in the predictive model. The LSTM neural network was used for predicting the total overflow, and the resultof the SWMM (Storm Water Management Model) was applied as target data. The prediction of the inundation map was performed byusing logistic regression; the independent variable was the total overflow and the dependent variable was the presence or absence offlooding in each grid. The dependent variable of logistic regression was collected through the simulation results of a two-dimensionalflood model. The input data of the two-dimensional flood model were the overflow at each manhole calculated by the SWMM.According to the LSTM neural network parameters, the prediction results of total overflow were compared. Four predictive models wereused in this study depending on the parameter of the LSTM. The average RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) for verification and testingwas 1.4279 , 1.0079  for the four LSTM models. The minimum RMSE of the verification and testing was calculated as 1.1655 and 0.8797 . It was confirmed that the total overflow can be predicted similarly to the SWMM simulation results. Theprediction of inundation extent was performed by linking the logistic regression with the results of the LSTM neural network, and themaximum area fitness was 97.33 % when more than 0.5  depth was considered.

Financial market is also not an exception. Robo-Advisor is actively being developed, making up the weakness of traditional asset allocation methods and replacing the parts that are difficult for the traditional methods. It makes automated investment decisions with artificial intelligence algorithms and is used with various asset allocation models such as mean-variance model, Black-Litterman model and risk parity model. Risk parity model is a typical risk-based asset allocation model which is focused on the volatility of assets. It avoids investment risk structurally. So it has stability in the management of large size fund and it has been widely used in financial field. XGBoost model is a parallel tree-boosting method. It is an optimized gradient boosting model designed to be highly efficient and flexible. It not only makes billions of examples in limited memory environments but is also very fast to learn compared to traditional boosting methods. It is frequently used in various fields of data analysis and has a lot of advantages. So in this study, we propose a new asset allocation model that combines risk parity model and XGBoost machine learning model. This model uses XGBoost to predict the risk of assets and applies the predictive risk to the process of covariance estimation. There are estimated errors between the estimation period and the actual investment period because the optimized asset allocation model estimates the proportion of investments based on historical data. these estimated errors adversely affect the optimized portfolio performance. This study aims to improve the stability and portfolio performance of the model by predicting the volatility of the next investment period and reducing estimated errors of optimized asset allocation model. As a result, it narrows the gap between theory and practice and proposes a more advanced asset allocation model.  In this study, we used the Korean stock market price data for a total of 17 years from 2003 to 2019 for the empirical test of the suggested model. The data sets are specifically composed of energy, finance, IT, industrial, material, telecommunication, utility, consumer, health care and staple sectors. We accumulated the value of prediction using moving-window method by 1,000 in-sample and 20 out-of-sample, so we produced a total of 154 rebalancing back-testing results. We analyzed portfolio performance in terms of cumulative rate of return and got a lot of sample data because of long period results. Comparing with traditional risk parity model, this experiment recorded improvements in both cumulative yield and reduction of estimated errors. The total cumulative return is 45.748%, about 5% higher than that of risk parity model and also the estimated errors are reduced in 9 out of 10 industry sectors. The reduction of estimated errors increases stability of the model and makes it easy to apply in practical investment. The results of the experiment showed improvement of portfolio performance by reducing the estimated errors of the optimized asset allocation model.  Many financial models and asset allocation models are limited in practical investment because of the most fundamental question of whether the past characteristics of assets will continue into the future in the changing financial market. However, this study not only takes advantage of traditional asset allocation models, but also supplements the limitations of traditional methods and increases stability by predicting the risks of assets with the latest algorithm. There are various studies on parametric estimation methods to reduce the estimated errors in the portfolio optimization. We also suggested a new method to reduce estimated errors in optimized asset allocation model using machine learning. So this study is meaningful in that it proposes an advanced artificial intelligence asset allocation model for the fast-developing financial markets.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

In particular, the ε-insensitive loss function, which is a loss function often used in SVR, is a function thatdoes not generate penalties if the difference between the actual value and the estimated regression curve is within ε. In most studies, the ε-insensitive loss function is used symmetrically, and it is of interest to determine the value of ε. In SVQR (Support Vector Quantile Regression), the asymmetry of the width of and the slope of the penalty was controlled using the parameter p. However, the slope of the penalty is fixed according to the p value that determines the asymmetry of ε. In this study, a new ε-insensitive loss function with p₁ and p₂ parameters was proposed.

The problem that should be pre-determined rather than securing programming design ability for AMA implementation is the philosophical, psychological and neurological understanding of morality. Since moral judgment requires a high level of mental ability, it is hard to conclude that AI's moral decision-making ability has been secured just by reproducing human cognitive abilities such as memory and logic reasoning. AI morality is modeled on human morality and moral judgment, so as a moral agent, it is necessary to consider all aspects of the morality, including the accumulation of moral experience, moral emotion, the securing of the complexity of morality, and the relationship. The biggest task left for mankind to overcome AI myths and produce AMA as an ideal moral agent is a deep sarcasm about what kind of morality should be implemented.

Moral robots are required not only to have deep-rooted human emotional goals such as happiness, but also to have moral awareness, emotion, will, intuition, insight and practical skills surrounding moral judgment. For the realization of AMA, an understanding of the morality of computer engineer, ethicist and neuroscience should be cross-referenced. The question remains whether AI will create as diverse moral character as humans or realize the best moral human image that mankind should pursue. AI morality creates AI myths like neuromyths and demands more moral philosophy and ethical exploration of human beings in their approach to morality, as well as neuropsychological and neurological exploration.

In U.S., an artificial intelligence medical device that diagnoses diabetic retinopathy without the intervention of an ophthalmologist has been developed and is being used in U.S. hospitals by obtaining FDA approval. In addition, digital therapeutics such as tablet PC-based reminiscence therapy that treats cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's, and artificial intelligence chatbots that provide cognitive behavioral therapy such as depression through Facebook messengers or exclusive apps are being developed. As such, artificial intelligence medicine is a tool that provides not only auxiliary functions of cancer diagnosis and treatment, but also health management, and personalized health advice for chronic disease such as heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. Artificial intelligence medicine is not a substitute for human doctors yet, but with the waves of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it is deeply penetrating the health care sector enough to affect the quality of people's lives, and it is also bringing about changes in communication and norms in the healthcare and medical environment. Changes in communication between medical practitioner and patients due to artificial intelligence that converges into medical care are foreshadowing the impact of the paradigm of existing norms and legislation. In this paper, the followings is examined ; the aspects of artificial intelligence entering the realm of medical care, the changes in the relationships between artificial intelligence and human doctors, and the normative factors in it, and create public legal influences such as the basic rights of personal rights, the protection of privacy, the principle of equality, and the responsibility of medical actions surrounding artificial intelligence and the permission of medical devices.

Big IoT Healthcare Data Analytics Framework Based on Fog and Cloud Computing,2020,"['Cloud Computing', 'Fog Computing', 'E-Health', 'Electronic Health Records', 'Healthcare Data Analytics', 'Internet of Things', 'IoT']",,"Throughout the world, aging populations and doctor shortages have helped drive the increasing demand for smart healthcare systems. Recently, these systems have benefited from the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, and machine learning. However, these advances result in the generation of large amounts of data, making healthcare data analysis a major issue. These data have a number of complex properties such as high-dimensionality, irregularity, and sparsity, which makes efficient processing difficult to implement. These challenges are met by big data analytics. In this paper, we propose an innovative analytic framework for big healthcare data that are collected either from IoT wearable devices or from archived patient medical images. The proposed method would efficiently address the data heterogeneity problem using middleware between heterogeneous data sources and MapReduce Hadoop clusters.

These methods have the advantage of being easy to understand, but have difficulty in converting data while keeping information loss small. In addition to masking and categorization, various methods of de-identification have been researched.

In 1935, Entomologist and member of Kanamojikai, Tsunetaro Okazaki embarked on a research project related to Kanji. In a Kanji writing test conducted on 1479 elementary school students in Tokyo, the average number of correct Kanji per person was only 631. As a result of having 424 ordinary people select 1929 Kanji including regular use Kanji, the number of Kanji selected by 50 or less is 809, accounting for 42% of the total. As a result of examining the 60-day Chinese words in five newspapers, the total number of Kanji was 3542, of which 100 characters had an appearance frequency of 38.7% and 500 characters had an appearance frequency of 77.3%. Based on these results, Okazaki created a proposal to limit 500 Kanji characters. The proposed restrictions based on Okazaki’s empirical research are quite convincing. However, as can be seen from the results of the newspaper survey, it seems that the 500 character limit proposal is somewhat impossible in the situation where about 79% of the Chinese words are read aloud. Currently, the number of common use Kanji in Japan is 2136. Compared to the number of common use Kanji in the 1930s, it increased by 278 characters. Through empirical surveys, Okazaki was trying to reduce the number of Kanji that would be a substantial burden on learning. Now that we can enter a lot of Kanji using machines, we should take a serious look at Okazaki’s proposal.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

This concept aims for the ‘harmonious development of human abilities’ based on the premise of both self-understanding and world-understanding. For the question of how to strengthen the competence of subjects in the current accelerated globally changing world is one of the major challenges faced today in the field of education.In order to detect global changes, Mega Trends and the 4th Industrial Revolution were set as key issues. Moreover, AI was closely looked at as a driving force that will play a crucial role in leading the world of the future. The development of AI, along with the rosy prospect of liberating humans from work and thus enriching their lives, has in fact caused many to take a negative view regarding suchcuttin g-edge science and technology. For sucha radical advancement may actually bring humanity itself to the brink of a crisis. Indeed, perhaps the most feared prospect is that AI might accelerate the rise of what is being called a “post-human” world. In relation to such a post-human era, the issues of human existence, the end of labor, and the inevitable gap arising between AI and humanity, were discussed.In the age of AI, liberal arts education should actively intervene in the achievements of advanced science and technology, as well as transform our perception and values of machines. For that purpose, it is necessary to instill the values of coexistence, symbiosis, and coevolution with non-human beings (animals, plants, ecosystems, nature, things, and the universe itself). In terms of contents, it is also necessary for us to improve the standard draft of the Korean National Institute for General Education so that it might better fit a post-human era. Given the influence of AI, we need to redesign the future of human beings who will be living with machines, and to provide a liberal arts program suitable for such a world. In this way, learner-centered education, design thinking, project-based instruction, and liberal learning should be enthusiastically supported.However, whether the era of artificial general intelligence (AGI) comes or not, the future of mankind will ultimately depend on human choice. The accountability of future liberal arts education should be found in raising the discernment, morality, and ethical awareness of learners, and to develop their faculty of judgment so that one may distinguish good from evil, right from wrong and beauty from ugliness.

Accordingly, the field of machine learning is growing rapidly, and developers are using and reproducing various learning algorithms in each field. Although various analysis of open source software has been made, there is a lack of studies to help develop or use deep learning open source software in the industry. This study thus attempts to derive a strategy for adopting the framework through case studies of a deep learning open source framework.  Based on the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework and literature review related to the adoption of open source software, we employed the case study framework that includes technological factors as perceived relative advantage, perceived compatibility, perceived complexity, and perceived trialability, organizational factors as management support and knowledge & expertise, and environmental factors as availability of technology skills and services, and platform long term viability. We conducted a case study analysis of three companies adoption cases (two cases of success and one case of failure) and revealed that seven out of eight TOE factors and several factors regarding company, team and resource are significant for the adoption of deep learning open source framework. By organizing the case study analysis results, we provided five important success factors for adopting deep learning framework: the knowledge and expertise of developers in the team, hardware (GPU) environment, data enterprise cooperation system, deep learning framework platform, deep learning framework work tool service.  In order for an organization to successfully adopt a deep learning open source framework, at the stage of using the framework, first, the hardware (GPU) environment for AI R&D group must support the knowledge and expertise of the developers in the team. Second, it is necessary to support the use of deep learning frameworks by research developers through collecting and managing data inside and outside the company with a data enterprise cooperation system. Third, deep learning research expertise must be supplemented through cooperation with researchers from academic institutions such as universities and research institutes. Satisfying three procedures in the stage of using the deep learning framework, companies will increase the number of deep learning research developers, the ability to use the deep learning framework, and the support of GPU resource. In the proliferation stage of the deep learning framework, fourth, a company makes the deep learning framework platform that improves the research efficiency and effectiveness of the developers, for example, the optimization of the hardware (GPU) environment automatically. Fifth, the deep learning framework tool service team complements the developers expertise through sharing the information of the external deep learning open source framework community to the in-house community and activating developer retraining and seminars.  To implement the identified five success factors, a step-by-step enterprise procedure for adoption of the deep learning framework was proposed: defining the project problem, confirming whether the deep learning methodology is the right method, confirming whether the deep learning framework is the right tool, using the deep learning framework by the enterprise, spreading the framework of the enterprise.

In this work, both modes of data were analyzed in combined and separately with both machine learning and deep learning algorithms for finding sentiments from twitter based airline data using several features such as TF–IDF, Bag of words, N-gram, and emoticon lexicons. This research demonstrates that whenever emoticons are used, their associated sentiment dominates the sentiment conveyed by textual data analysis.

The reason is that whether or not to be exempt from the threat of potential copyright infringement is the key for the development of artificial intelligence technology, which has a huge impact on the economy, society, and creative culture as well as science and technology. Todays economic advantage belongs to large-scale online platforms that use the data of others, not the existing rights holders or the license holders for exclusive rights such as copyright. Through machine learning technology, these companies can extract value from the protected expression of copyright holders without permission and use that value for commercial purposes that could one day endanger the livelihood of human creators. Constructing fair use to protect this activity would conflict with the public interest and could potentially exacerbate social inequality threatened by artificial intelligence. On the contrary, judging that machine learning of expressive use does not constitute fair use will frustrate advances in new technologies that will promote positive economic growth and social development. Machine learning will realize enormous social and economic benefits, and many of these benefits come from real human creative works. Such a fair use dilemma should go in the direction of enhancing social equity by reaffirming the purpose and purpose of the Copyright Act, which promotes the creation and dissemination of human expressions by guaranteeing the right to the expressive value of creative works to the copyright holder. This requires a paradigm shift and change that allows for the balanced consideration of various aspects, from the past perspective where the judgment of fair use was based solely on “works” to “technology”. The recognition or disapproval of fair use will cause irreversible social harm and technological retreat, so it will have to move in a way that conforms to the public interest of fulfilling the constitutional obligation of the Copyright Act on the basis of the new fair use judgment standard that can establish a balance point suitable for the artificial intelligence era.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

It also mentions STEM education, AI convergence curriculum, and budget for supporting the development of teaching materials and tools. However, it is necessary to create a new type of curriculum at a time when artificial intelligence curriculum has never existed before.

Recently, the field of natural language processing has been actively researched using pre-trained language representation models with a large amount of corpus. In particular, the named entity recognition, which is one of the fields of natural language processing, uses a supervised learning method, which requires a large amount of training dataset and computation. Reinforcement learning is a method that learns through trial and error experience without initial data and is closer to the process of human learning than other machine learning methodologies and is not much applied to the field of natural language processing yet. It is often used in simulation environments such as Atari games and AlphaGo. BERT is a general-purpose language model developed by Google that is pre-trained on large corpus and computational quantities. Recently, it is a language model that shows high performance in the field of natural language processing research and shows high accuracy in many downstream tasks of natural language processing. In this paper, we propose a new named entity recognition DeNERT model using two deep learning models, DQN and BERT. The proposed model is trained by creating a learning environment of reinforcement learning model based on language expression which is the advantage of the general language model.

Recently, as campaign channels have been expanded in various ways due to the rapid revitalization of online, various types of campaigns are being carried out by companies at a level that cannot be compared to the past. However, customers tend to perceive it as spam as the fatigue of campaigns due to duplicate exposure increases. Also, from a corporate standpoint, there is a problem that the effectiveness of the campaign itself is decreasing, such as increasing the cost of investing in the campaign, which leads to the low actual campaign success rate. Accordingly, various studies are ongoing to improve the effectiveness of the campaign in practice. This campaign system has the ultimate purpose to increase the success rate of various campaigns by collecting and analyzing various data related to customers and using them for campaigns. In particular, recent attempts to make various predictions related to the response of campaigns using machine learning have been made. It is very important to select appropriate features due to the various features of campaign data. If all of the input data are used in the process of classifying a large amount of data, it takes a lot of learning time as the classification class expands, so the minimum input data set must be extracted and used from the entire data. In addition, when a trained model is generated by using too many features, prediction accuracy may be degraded due to overfitting or correlation between features. Therefore, in order to improve accuracy, a feature selection technique that removes features close to noise should be applied, and feature selection is a necessary process in order to analyze a high-dimensional data set. Among the greedy algorithms, SFS (Sequential Forward Selection), SBS (Sequential Backward Selection), SFFS (Sequential Floating Forward Selection), etc. are widely used as traditional feature selection techniques. It is also true that if there are many risks and many features, there is a limitation in that the performance for classification prediction is poor and it takes a lot of learning time. Therefore, in this study, we propose an improved feature selection algorithm to enhance the effectiveness of the existing campaign. The purpose of this study is to improve the existing SFFS sequential method in the process of searching for feature subsets that are the basis for improving machine learning model performance using statistical characteristics of the data to be processed in the campaign system. Through this, features that have a lot of influence on performance are first derived, features that have a negative effect are removed, and then the sequential method is applied to increase the efficiency for search performance and to apply an improved algorithm to enable generalized prediction. Through this, it was confirmed that the proposed model showed better search and prediction performance than the traditional greed algorithm. Compared with the original data set, greed algorithm, genetic algorithm (GA), and recursive feature elimination (RFE), the campaign success prediction was higher. In addition, when performing campaign success prediction, the improved feature selection algorithm was found to be helpful in analyzing and interpreting the prediction results by providing the importance of the derived features. This is important features such as age, customer rating, and sales, which were previously known statistically. Unlike the previous campaign planners, features such as the combined product name, average 3-month data consumption rate, and the last 3-month wireless data usage were unexpectedly selected as important features for the campaign response, which they rarely used to select campaign targets. It was confirmed that base attributes can also be very important feature",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Finding the Optimal Data Classification Method Using LDA and QDA Discriminant Analysis,2020,"['Machine Learning', 'LDA', 'QDA', 'SVM', 'Classification Analysis']",,"With the recent introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the use of data is rapidly increasing, and newly generated data is also rapidly increasing. In order to obtain the results to be analyzed based on these data, the first thing to do is to classify the data well. However, when classifying data, if only one classification technique belonging to the machine learning technique is applied to classify and analyze it, an error of overfitting can be accompanied. In order to reduce or minimize the problems caused by misclassification of the classification system such as overfitting, it is necessary to derive an optimal classification by comparing the results of each classification by applying several classification techniques. If you try to interpret the data with only one classification technique, you will have poor reasoning and poor predictions of results. This study seeks to find a method for optimally classifying data by looking at data from various perspectives and applying various classification techniques such as LDA and QDA, such as linear or nonlinear classification, as a process before data analysis in data analysis. In order to obtain the reliability and sophistication of statistics as a result of big data analysis, it is necessary to analyze the meaning of each variable and the correlation between the variables.

다중 웹 데이터와 LSTM을 사용한 전염병 예측,2020,"['머신러닝', '전염병 예측', '웹 데이터', 'LSTM', 'Machine Learning', 'Predict infectious diseases', 'Web data']",,"Infectious diseases have long plagued mankind, and predicting and preventing them has been a big challenge for mankind. For this reasen, various studies have been conducted so far to predict infectious diseases. Most of the early studies relied on epidemiological data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the problem was that the data provided by the CDC was updated only once a week, making it difficult to predict the number of real-time disease outbreaks. However, with the emergence of various Internet media due to the recent development of IT technology, studies have been conducted to predict the occurrence of infectious diseases through web data, and most of the studies we have researched have been using single Web data to predict diseases. However, disease forecasting through a single Web data has the disadvantage of having difficulty collecting large amounts of learning data and making accurate predictions through models for recent outbreaks such as COVID-19. Thus, we would like to demonstrate through experiments that models that use multiple Web data to predict the occurrence of infectious diseases through LSTM models are more accurate than those that use single Web data and suggest models suitable for predicting infectious diseases. In this experiment, we predicted the occurrence of Malaria and Epidemic-parotitis using a single web data model and the model we propose. A total of 104 weeks of NEWS, SNS, and search query data were collected, of which 75 weeks were used as learning data and 29 weeks were used as verification data. In the experiment we predicted verification data using our proposed model and single web data, Pearson correlation coefficient for the predicted results of our proposed model showed the highest similarity at 0.94, 0.86, and RMSE was also the lowest at 0.19, 0.07",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

The results showed that both RNN and HGLM models showed similar performances in the data collection designs to which both models can be applied.

However, when the cost of obtaining data is so high that it is difficult to build ideal training data, the number of samples for each class may be acquired very differently, and a serious data-imbalance problem can occur. If such a problem occurs in the t raining data, a ll c lasses a re not t rained equally, and classes containing relatively few data will have significantly lower recall values. Additionally, the reliability of evaluation indices such as accuracy and precision will be reduced.Therefore, this study sought to overcome the problem of data imbalance in two stages. First, we introduced weighted accuracy and weighted precision as new evaluation indices that can take into account a data-imbalance ratio by modifying conventional measures of accuracy and precision. Next, oversampling was performed to balance weighted precision and recall among classes.

Users, on a restaurant guide site, utilize IDs to post their recommendation articles on restaurants, and these posted articles are a valuable information source for other users. Open users can search for restaurants and read recommendation articles posted by other users. Furthermore, they can react (e.g., “like”) to a recommendation article when they feel it is helpful or they feel like visiting the restaurant. On a target restaurant guide site, each post includes the user ID, restaurant name, recommendation sentences, etc., and the number of reactions is considered to depend on these posted contents. For users who post recommendation articles, the number of reactions to their posts represents the degree of empathy from other users and is an important motivation for posting. Therefore, posting users will benefit from guidelines on how to write good recommendation sentences to increase the number of reactions. Moreover, the number of reactions can be regarded as an important indicator of the activity level of the restaurant guide site from the viewpoint of the service operating company. Therefore, an analytical model developed using historical information such as posts and reactions by users would be useful for determining the relationship between posted contents and the number of reactions.

Variables affecting the use of building energy include the identification of environmental conditions, historical conditions, and schedule conditions, and these factors have a sophisticated effect on buildings. One of the most influential variables is the building schedule. Because each building has its own schedule, standardized schedules cannot be applied to various buildings, and it is difficult for non-experts to analyze or predict schedules in these cases.

In order to compare with the existing method, the six buildings are divided into schedules when they are not scheduled, weekdays/weekends, days of week and when schedule analysis algorithm are applied. Machine learning is performed using the LSTM model, and prediction accuracy is verified through the CvRMSE and MBE.

The size of object in pixel was obtained on individual potato, and they will be used to predict the yield of potatoes.Methods In order to collect the images needed for deep learning, potato images at the time of harvesting were obtained from potato farms. Annotation was entered for each irregular potato shape, where approximately 4500 potatoes were used. Resnet-101 was selected as the backbone of Mask R-CNN with a feature pyramid network. Transfer training was applied to shorten training time and limit the number of images needed to train the model. The classification performance evaluation was conducted to verify the trained model. The size of potato in pixel was obtained from the output image through the potato detection model by the segmentation algorithm using MATLAB.Results The total number of training for the potato detection model was 12,000, and the training loss of Mask R-CNN was less than 0.1%. The potato detection results from 69 randomly selected test images showed that the average detection precision was 90.8%, recall 93.0%, and F1 score 91.9%.Conclusions Potato detection model with Mask R-CNN can detect irregularly shaped potatoes on similar color soil surface. The size of the detected potato region can be extracted as well.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

High turbidity during floods increases the operation cost of a drinking water supply system. Thus, the management of turbidity is essential for providing safe water to the public. There have been various efforts to estimate turbidity in river systems for proper management and early warning of high turbidity in the water supply process. Advanced data analysis technology using machine learning has been increasingly used in water quality management processes. Artificial neural networks(ANNs) is one of the first algorithms applied, where the overfitting of a model to observed data and vanishing gradient in the backpropagation process limit the wide application of ANNs in practice. In recent years, deep learning, which overcomes the limitations of ANNs, has been applied in water quality management. LSTM is one of novel deep learning algorithms that is widely used in the analysis of time series data.In this study, LSTM is used for the prediction of high turbidity(>30 NTU) in a river from the relationship of turbidity to discharge, which enables early warning of high turbidity in a drinking water supply system. The model showed 0.98, 0.99, 0.98 and 0.99 for precision, recall, F1-score and accuracy respectively, for the prediction of high turbidity in a river with 2 hour frequency data. The sensitivity of the model to the observation intervals of data is also compared with time periods of 2 hour, 8 hour, 1 day and 2 days. The model shows higher precision with shorter observation intervals, which underscores the importance of collecting high frequency data for better management of water resources in the future.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv
Development and Optimization of Deep Belief Networks Applied for Academic Performance Prediction with Larger Datasets,2020,"['Student performance', 'Deep learning', 'Restricted Boltzmann machine', 'Deep belief network', 'Feature selection', 'Hyperparameters', 'Regularization']",,"Deep learning has recently attracted increasing interest for several applications, and great progress has been made. This paper introduces a novel application of a deep learning framework called deep belief networks (DBNs) that can be used to predict the predicting academic performance of larger datasets. First, unsupervised training is considered a so-called pre-training section. The stacked restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) was trained to obtain the trained weights instead of random initial weights. Subsequently, supervised learning was adopted using backpropagation in the fine-tuning section to classify the student performance levels. An optimization approach for improving the classification performance of the proposed DBN was proposed. The optimization approach consisted of using a feature selection method to obtain the optimal feature subset, optimizing the DBN model with the optimal values of the hyperparameters, and applying the L2-regularization method for weight decay. The experiment was carried out with two phases. Phase1 was implemented with an actual dataset. Phase 2 was then implemented with four artificial datasets of increasing sizes. Many experiments were performed independently on each dataset. With a larger dataset, the improved DBN generated the highest accuracy and lowest root mean square error with more accuracy and effectiveness than the other proposed algorithms.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv
이상치 데이터를 고려한 DT-CNN 기반의 전동기 고장 예측,2020,"['Deep learning', 'Open-set recognition', 'DT-CNN', 'Motor fault prediction', 'Machine learning theory']",,"One of the major problems with the existing motor failure prediction system is to assume that all motors with the same fault condition have the same or a similar signal. This is a problem that arises because it is impossible to measure all the countless types of motors and data of driving conditions and failures. It is difficult to implement a general-purpose failure prediction system with an existing system having limited data and limited output. Data that have a large difference because they do not exist in the existing system are called outlier data. In previous studies, the problem arising from the outlier data has not been considered. To solve this problem, a system designed by separating the failure diagnosis model and the failure prediction model is proposed. The diagnostic model of the proposed system can detect data that are not inside big data using a decision-tree convolution neural network (DT-CNN). By using the diagnostic model and the predictive model in series, it is possible to analyze data in a non-measured state more efficiently. Additionally, a method for averaging the outputs of the diagnostic and predictive models is proposed. Through this, the deep learning algorithm can obtain in effect of applying the filter. Furthermore, the average values can be used to confirm the long-term signal change trend. The proposed system improves the problems of the existing failure prediction and enables more practical failure prediction.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Therefore, minutiae tend to be used with skeleton images. There have been many studies on security vulnerabilities in the characteristics of minutiae, but vulnerability studies on the skeleton are weak, so this study attempts to analyze the vulnerability of presentation attacks against the skeleton. To this end, we propose a method based on the skeleton to recover the original fingerprint using a learning algorithm. The proposed method includes a new learning model, Pix2Pix, which adds a latent vector to the existing Pix2Pix model, thereby generating a natural fingerprint.

However, the disadvantage is that it takes a long time to generate such an adversarial example. Therefore, in some cases, an attack may be necessary that quickly causes the neural network to recognize it incorrectly.

We propose a new SSD cache allocation scheme by making use of video popularity prediction based on a machine learning technique called support vector regression (SVR). To derive future popularity, we first construct a video popularity prediction model based on various feature types including title, thumbnail, and a ratio of “likes"" and “dislikes"" and viewing history to predict the popularity of video clips and analyze how complexity and accuracy of the SVR vary with each feature type. Based on this, we develop an SSD cache allocation model that uses video popularity as a parameter. We simulated a video server that stores 90,000 actual YouTube video clips to evaluate our scheme in terms of 1) popularity prediction accuracy and computational complexity 2) SSD caching set determination performance compared with optimal solution.

Long-term exposure to SO2 can result in a negative effect on the human body causing respiratory or cardiovascular disease, which makes the effective and continuous monitoring of SO2 crucial. In South Korea, SO2 monitoring at ground stations has been performed, but this does not provide spatially continuous information of SO2 concentrations. Thus, this research estimated spatially continuous ground-level SO2 concentrations at 1 km resolution over South Korea through the synergistic use of satellite data and numerical models. A stacking ensemble approach, fusing multiple machine learning algorithms at two levels (i.e., base and meta), was adopted for ground-level SO2 estimation using data from January 2015 to April 2019. Random forest and extreme gradient boosting were used as based models and multiple linear regression was adopted for the meta-model. The cross-validation results showed that the metamodel produced the improved performance by 25% compared to the base models, resulting in the correlation coefficient of 0.48 and root-mean-square-error of 0.0032 ppm. In addition, the temporal transferability of the approach was evaluated for one-year data which were not used in the model development. The spatial distribution of ground-level SO2 concentrations based on the proposed model agreed with the general seasonality of SO2 and the temporal patterns of emission sources.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

This study is about the prediction of ultrafine dust concentration, and it attempts to predict the middle (after 1 week) prediction while most of the existing studies are only short-term (after 1 hour to 2 days) prediction. A classification model was develeped to predict the average daily ultrafine dust concentration in Seoul by dividing it into two stages: normal (less than 36) and bad (more than 36). XGBoost was used as the classification model and an ensemble model was constructed after creating individual models through the hyperparameter optimization based on different evaluation indicators in order to maximize the performance of the model. The average daily fine dust concentration in Seoul from January to June 2019 was predicted after training the model using data from 2016 to 2018, and the performance of the ensemble model presented in this study was higher than that of a single model. In addition, the method of imbalance problem was applied since the number of cases where the level of fine dust is bad is much less than the number of cases where the level of fine dust is normal.

We measured subjects’ proximal interphalangeal angles and air pressures in the pneumatic glove during the exercise to monitor grab/release patterns. The soft robot helped open their paralyzed finger joints by more than 50 degrees on average regardless of Brunnstrom stages. We applied pattern recognition methods on the measurement to quantitatively evaluate the subjects. A support vector machine revealed a misclassification rate of 20%, implying that there were a considerable number of overlapping data sets near the boundary between Brunnstrom stages.

This study utilized BCC models to reflect the size effect of festivals and classified the festivals into four ratings according the efficiency scores. Multi-classification method were considered to build the prediction of four ratings for the festivals in this study. We utilized neural networks and SVMs with OAO(one-against-one), OAR(one-against-rest), C&S(crammer & singer) with Korea festival data from 2013 to 2018.Findings: The number of total visitors in low efficient rating of DEA is more larger than the number of total visitors in high efficient ratings although the total expenditure of visitors is the highest in the most efficient rating when we analyzed the results of DEA for the characteristics of four ratings. SVM with OAO model showed the most superior performance in accuracy as SVM with OAR model was not trained well because of the imbalanced distribution between efficient rating and the other ratings.

Over the past decades, text mining technologies have been utilized in various industries for practical applications. In the field of business intelligence, it has been employed to discover new market and/or technology opportunities and support rational decision making of business participants.  The market information such as market size, market growth rate, and market share is essential for setting companies’ business strategies. There has been a continuous demand in various fields for specific product level-market information. However, the information has been generally provided at industry level or broad categories based on classification standards, making it difficult to obtain specific and proper information.  In this regard, we propose a new methodology that can estimate the market sizes of product groups at more detailed levels than that of previously offered. We applied Word2Vec algorithm, a neural network based semantic word embedding model, to enable automatic market size estimation from individual companies’ product information in a bottom-up manner. The overall process is as follows: First, the data related to product information is collected, refined, and restructured into suitable form for applying Word2Vec model. Next, the preprocessed data is embedded into vector space by Word2Vec and then the product groups are derived by extracting similar products names based on cosine similarity calculation. Finally, the sales data on the extracted products is summated to estimate the market size of the product groups. As an experimental data, text data of product names from Statistics Koreas microdata (345,103 cases) were mapped in multidimensional vector space by Word2Vec training. We performed parameters optimization for training and then applied vector dimension of 300 and window size of 15 as optimized parameters for further experiments. We employed index words of Korean Standard Industry Classification (KSIC) as a product name dataset to more efficiently cluster product groups. The product names which are similar to KSIC indexes were extracted based on cosine similarity. The market size of extracted products as one product category was calculated from individual companies’ sales data. The market sizes of 11,654 specific product lines were automatically estimated by the proposed model. For the performance verification, the results were compared with actual market size of some items. The Pearsons correlation coefficient was 0.513.  Our approach has several advantages differing from the previous studies. First, text mining and machine learning techniques were applied for the first time on market size estimation, overcoming the limitations of traditional sampling based- or multiple assumption required-methods. In addition, the level of market category can be easily and efficiently adjusted according to the purpose of information use by changing cosine similarity threshold. Furthermore, it has a high potential of practical applications since it can resolve unmet needs for detailed market size information in public and private sectors. Specifically, it can be utilized in technology evaluation and technology commercialization support program conducted by governmental institutions, as well as business strategies consulting and market analysis report publishing by private firms.  The limitation of our study is that the presented model needs to be improved in terms of accuracy and reliability. The semantic-based word embedding module can be advanced by giving a proper order in the preprocessed dataset or by combining another algorithm such as Jaccard similarity with Word2Vec.

Two Local States of Ambient Water,2020,"['Water Anomaly', 'Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation', 'Widom Delta', 'Machine Learning']",,"The non-monotonic trends of thermodynamic response functions have long been a mystery of water. The idea, that water may be a mixture of two local states, came out more than a century ago to explain the origin of the non-monotonic behaviors. Recently, this idea is materialized through the hypothesis of the second critical point of water and then the anomalies are outcomes of critical fluctuation. Although the typical macroscopic heterogeneity (Widom line) of critical fluctuation stays in the vicinity of the critical point, as we have previously shown that the microscopic heterogeneity is identified far from it which extends the linear heterogeneity, the Widom line, to the areal one as a Widom Delta.With this background, we search for two local states of the ambient water. Distinct states in ambient condition are not to be contrasted by a single strong feature such as density but they are expressed by a combination of weak features that reflects locally correlated structures. In this work, we identify the formation of local bicontinuous micro-domain formations of water attributing its softness by using machine learning order parameters. Interestingly, the radial distribution functions are similar to two phases in the liquid-liquid phase transition and they are well fitted by the two-state model. The hard-label domain is dominant at a lower temperature but changes its label to a more fluctuating soft-label domain at high temperature. There exist crossover behaviors around 310-320 K.

However, it is difficult for edge devices to use deep learning applications used in cloud servers because most edge devices at the end of the network have limited performance. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a distributed processing method that uses reduced classification models to jointly perform inferences on multiple edge devices. The reduced classification models have compressed model weights, and perform inferences for some parts of the total classification labels. The experimental results confirmed that the accuracy of the result of the proposed distributed processing method is similar to the accuracy of the result of the original model, even if the proposed reduced classification models had much less parameters than those of the original model.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Rapid Process Modeling of the Aerosol Jet Printing Based on Gaussian Process Regression with Latin Hypercube Sampling,2020,['3D printing · Aerosol jet process · Gaussian process regression · Machine learning · Process modeling'],,"Aerosol jet printing (AJP) technology is a relatively new 3D printing technology for producing customized microelectronic components due to its high design flexibility and fine feature deposition. However, complex interactions between machine, process parameters and materials will influence line morphology and remain a challenge on modeling effectively. And the system drift which induced by many changing and uncertain factors will affect the printing process significantly. Hence, it is necessary to develop a small data set based machine learning approach to model relationship between the process parameters and the line morphology. In this paper, we propose a rapid process modeling method for AJP process and consider sheath gas flow rate, carrier gas flow rate, stage speed as AJP process parameters, and line width and line roughness as the line morphology. Latin hypercube sampling is adopted to generate experimental points. And, Gaussian process regression (GPR) is used for modeling the AJP process because GPR has the capability of providing the prediction uncertainty in terms of variance.

The purpose of this study was to develop and validate Figure-Copy Test(FCT), as a new dementia screening test, that can measure neurological damage and cognitive impairment, and then to examine whether the grading precesses for screening can be automated through machine learning procedure by using FCT images. For this end, FCT, Korean version of MMSE for Dementia Screening (MMSE-DS) and Clock Drawing Test were administrated to a total of 270 participants from normal and damaged elderly groups. Results demonstrated that FCT scores showed high internal constancy and significant correlation coefficients with the other two test scores. Discriminant analyses showed that the accuracy of classification for the normal and damaged groups using FCT were 90.8% and 77.1%, respectively, and these were relatively higher than the other two tests. Importantly, we identified that the participants whose MMSE-DS scores were higher than the cutoff but showed lower scores in FCT were successfully screened out through clinical diagnosis. Finally, machine learning using the FCT image data showed an accuracy of 73.70%.

For the conservation of future ecosystems, it is necessary to analyze the effects of climate change on the ecosystem for planning the habitat conservation strategy. Especially, biological indicator species that play a prominent role in understanding the effects of climate fluctuation on the ecosystem have been regarded as an essential factor. Therefore, analyzing and predicting the habitats of biological indicator species are crucial to understanding the distribution shift and planning biological conservation. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel ensemble model to predict the habitat distribution changes of three biological indicator species, including Taxus cuspidata, Abies koreana, and Abies nephrolepis, under climate change scenarios. More specifically, we constructed an ensemble-based species distribution model by combining several machine learning models. The prediction accuracy of our model was 0.9 or higher based on the True Skill Statistic (TSS), which is superior to other existing models. We also identified the environmental factors that have a significant effect on species distribution through variable importance analysis, and analyzed the distribution changes according to different climate change scenarios. Finally, we visualized the distribution of the species in 2050 and 2070, based on representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios.

This paper presents a semi-automatic method for generation of material and texture rich as-built BIM. The method captures and integrates material and textural information of building elements into as-built BIM using thermal infrared sensing (TIS). The proposed method uses TIS to capture thermal images of the interior walls of an existing building. These images are then processed to extract the interior walls using a segmentation algorithm. The digital numbers in the resulted images are then transformed into radiance values that represent the emitted thermal infrared radiation. Machine learning techniques are then applied to build a correlation between the radiance values and the material type in each image. The radiance values were used to extract textural information from the images. The extracted textural and material information are then robustly integrated into the as-built BIM providing the data needed for the assessment of building conditions in general including energy efficiency, among others.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

The stock price prediction using the machine learning that has been carried out to date is mainly based on the prediction of the market index such as KOSPI, and utilizes technical data that is fundamental index or price derivative index using financial statement. However, most researches have proceeded without any explicit verification of the prediction rate of the learning data. In this study, we conducted an experiment to determine the degree of market prediction ability of basic indicators, technical indicators, and system risk indicators (AR) used in stock price prediction. First, we set the core parameters for each financial indicator and define the objective function reflecting the return and volatility. Then, an experiment was performed to extract the sample from the distribution of each parameter by the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and to find the optimum value to maximize the objective function. Since Robo Advisor is a commodity that trades financial instruments such as stocks and funds, it can not be utilized only by forecasting the market index. The sample for this experiment is data of 17 years of 1,500 stocks that have been listed in Korea for more than 5 years after listing. As a result of the experiment, it was possible to establish a meaningful trading strategy that exceeds the market return. This study can be utilized as a basis for the development of Robo Advisor products in that it includes a large proportion of listed stocks in Korea, rather than an experiment on a single index, and verifies market predictability of various financial indicators.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Defects on the surface of railroads are caused by various factors such as friction between track binding devices and adjacent tracks and can cause accidents such as broken rails [14], so railroad maintenance for defects is necessary. Therefore, various researches on defect detection and inspection using image processing or machine learning on railway surface images have been conducted to automate railroad inspection and to reduce railroad maintenance costs. In general, the performance of the image processing analysis method and machine learning technology is affected by the quantity and quality of data. For this reason, some researches require specific devices or vehicles to acquire images of the track surface at regular intervals to obtain a database of various railway surface images [15, 16]. On the contrary, in this study, in order to reduce and improve the operating cost of image acquisition, we constructed the 'Defective Railroad Surface Regeneration Model' by applying the methods presented in the related studies of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) [1]. Thus, we aimed to detect defects on railroad surface even without a dedicated database. This constructed model is designed to learn to generate the railroad surface combining the different railroad surface textures and the original surface, considering the ground truth of the railroad defects. The generated images of the railroad surface were used as training data in defect detection network [2], which is based on Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) [3]. To validate its performance, we clustered and divided the railroad data into three subsets, one subset as original railroad texture images and the remaining two subsets as another railroad surface texture images. In the first experiment, we used only original texture images for training sets in the defect detection model. And in the second experiment, we trained the generated images that were generated by combining the original images with a few railroad textures of the other images. Each defect detection model was evaluated in terms of 'intersection of union(IoU)' and F1-score measures with ground truths. As a result, the scores increased by about 10~15% when the generated images were used, compared to the case that only the original images were used. This proves that it is possible to detect defects by using the existing data and a few different texture images, even for the railroad surface images in which dedicated training database is not constructed.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Brain tumor diagnostic model and dietary effect based on extracellular vesicle microbiome data in serum,2020,,,"The human microbiome has been recently associated with human health and disease. Brain tumors (BTs) are a particularly difficult condition to directly link to the microbiome, as microorganisms cannot generally cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB). However, some nanosized extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from microorganisms can cross the BBB and enter the brain. Therefore, we conducted metagenomic analysis of microbial EVs in both serum (152 BT patients and 198 healthy controls (HC)) and brain tissue (5 BT patients and 5 HC) samples based on the V3–V4 regions of 16S rDNA. We then developed diagnostic models through logistic regression and machine learning algorithms using serum EV metagenomic data to assess the ability of various dietary supplements to reduce BT risk in vivo. Models incorporating the stepwise method and the linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) method yielded 12 and 29 significant genera as potential biomarkers, respectively. Models using the selected biomarkers yielded areas under the curves (AUCs) >0.93, and the model using machine learning resulted in an AUC of 0.99. In addition, Dialister and [Eubacterium] rectale were significantly lower in both blood and tissue samples of BT patients than in those of HCs. In vivo tests showed that BT risk was decreased through the addition of sorghum, brown rice oil, and garlic but conversely increased by the addition of bellflower and pear. In conclusion, serum EV metagenomics shows promise as a rich data source for highly accurate detection of BT risk, and several foods have potential for mitigating BT risk.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Attackers can easily create malware using existing code or by using automated authoring tools, and the generated malware operates in a similar way to existing malware. Since most of the strings that can be extracted from malicious code are composed of information closely related to malicious behavior, it is processed by weighting data features using text mining based method to extract them as effective features for malware analysis.

인공지능(AI) 기반 지능정보사회 시대의 노동시장 변화: 경제사회학적 접근을 중심으로,2020,"['4차 산업혁명', '지능정보사회', '인공지능', '노동시장', 'Fourth Industrial Revolution', 'intelligence information society', 'artificial intelligence', 'labor market']","최근 지능정보기술을 접목한 디지털 변혁(Digital Transformation)이 빠르게 확산되면서 인공지능(AI) 기반의 다양한 지능형 정보시스템이 사회 가치를 창출해내는 지능정보사회로 변 모해가고 있다. 지능정보사회에서는 인공지능(AI) 기반의 지능형 시스템의 도입이 단순업무 뿐만 아니라 고차원적인 정신노동의 영역까지 확대되면서 노동시장에도 상당한 변화가 예상된다. 이러한 지능정보사회에서의 핵심인 인공지능(AI)은 1956년 존 맥커시(John McCarthy)가 미국 다트머스 대학(Dartmouth College)에서 열린 학술대회에서 인공지능(AI)이라는 용어를 사용하면서부터 기계가 생각을 하고 인간과 소통할 수 있는지에 관한 논의에 초점을 두고 관련 연구가 진행됐다. 최근 인공지능(AI)은 4차산업혁명과 함께 학계의 담론을 넘어서 기술혁신에 기반을 둔 산업구조의 변화와 사회변화를 이끌고 있다. 따라서 본 연구에서는 인공지능(AI)의 역사와 개념에 대해 살펴보고, 지능정보기술의 발달로 인한 사회의 변화를 노동시장의 변화에 초점을 맞추어 살펴보고자 한다. 또한, 인공지능이 직무에 어떠한 변화를 가져오고 있는지에 관한 사례들을 통해 노동시장의 변화를 고찰해 보고자 한다. 특히, 지능정보사회를 이끄는 기술발달과 관련하여 기술의 혁신성이나 경제적 합리성에 초점을 맞추는 선행연구와는 달리 인공지능(AI)이 인간과 관계를 맺는 하나의 기술체로 그 사회적 함의가 커지고 있는 시점에서 고용시장과 직업의 변화에 대한 경제사회적 관점에서 체계적으로 고찰할 필요가 있다.  이른바 4차 산업혁명 기술이라고 일컬어지는 인공지능(Artificial Intelligence: AI), 사물인터넷(Internet of Things: IoT), 3D 프린팅, 로봇, 빅데이터(Big Data), 블록체인(Block Chain), 나노(Nano) 기술과 바이오(Bio) 기술 등 지능정보기술의 발달은 인간의 생활양식과 가치관에 큰 변화를 일으키는 사회적 패러다임의 변화를 가속시키고 있다. 2016년 12월 미래창조과학부(현재의 과학기술정보통신부)에서 발표한 ‘지능정보사회의 중장기 종합대책’에서도 지능정보사회를 언급하면서 새로운 패러다임의 변화에 주목하였다.  인공지능(AI)의 확산에 따른 노동시장의 문제는 낙관론과 비관론이 첨예하게 대립하는 부분이다. 지능정보기술의 발전에 대한 낙관론적인 입장에서 합리성을 강조하며 노동의 생산성 향상과 산업의 효율성 확보라는 시각에서 노동시장의 변화를 바라보는 시각이 있는 반면, 인간과 기술의 상호작용의 변화와 함께 사회변동의 측면에서의 직무변화와 일자리 감소에 대한 우려의 시각이 공존하고 있다. 노동력 대체의 핵심인 자동화는 물리적 근로와 정신적 및 인지적 근로가 인공지능에 의해 대체된다는 것으로, 고용은 물론 산업혁명 이래로 상당한 사회적, 경제적 파장을 가져올 것으로 전망된다. 인공지능(AI) 기술의 발달로 인한 국내의 다양한 산업부문에서 일자리 대체는 피할 수 없는 사회의 변화일 것이다. 이미 많은 단순 반복적 업무에서 인공지능을 활용한 노동비용의 경감은 현실화되고 있으며 일자리 감소와 직무변화에 따른 새로운 유형의 일자리 창출을 위한 재교육 및 적극적인 사회적 지원을 필요성이 대두되고 있다.  인공지능(AI) 기반의 지능정보사회에서는 기존의 노동시장에서 고용과 경제성장에 결정적인 역할을 하였던 제조업이 축소되고 있으며 개방형 소통 플랫폼이 혁신의 중요한 환경으로 사회적 네트워크 속에서의 개방적 혁신을 지향하며 공유경제로 진화해 나가고 있다. 이러한 환경변화와 함께 지능형 시스템의 도입은 분석, 기획, 의사결정 등과 같은 인간의 정신노동 영역을 기술이 대체함으로써 상당한 직무변화가 예상된다. 또한, 인공지능(AI)은 창작도 할 수 있고, 인간의 의사결정과 문제해결에 직접 관여할 수 있을 것이다. 따라서 지능정보사회에서의 기술혁신에 따른 사회 전반의 효율성과 생산성 향상이 향후 노동시장에서의 일자리 감소 및 실업률 상승과 같은 사회문제로 이어지지 않도록 충분한 경제사회적 논의를 활성화할 필요가 있을 것이다. 또한, 지능정보사회에서는 새로운 노동과 일자리 창출도 가능할 것이기 때문에 변화에 저항하기보다는 개인이나 기업이 생존하기 위해서 이러한 시대의 변화를 선도하여 사회 전체의 효율성과 생산성을 제고하면서 시민의 자유와 복지를 보장하는데 인공지능 기술을 활용할 수 있어야 한다. 이와 더불어 지능정보사회에서의 인공지능 기술은 일종의 사회를 규율하는 구조적 힘을 가지면서 기술의 혁신이 사회변동의 핵심요인이 되고 있으며, 이러한 사회변동은 인공지능이 인간과 관계를 맺는 하나의 기술체로서 새로운 관계에서의 인간의 주체적인 역할과 과학기술을 바라보는 새로운 가치체계의 형성이 중요할 것이다. 또한, 기존의 노동과 여가에 대한 인식에 있어서 산업화를 거치며 형성된 노동의 가치에 대한 재해석과 더불어 문화와 여가에 대한 인식의 전환이 필요할 것이다.","With the innovation and diffusion of information technology, the Korean society is currently transforming into the intelligence information society for which various intelligent system may create social values and economic wealth. With the adoption of the artificial intelligence in the intelligence information society, considerable changes are expected in the labor market. Since John McCarthy coined artificial intelligence (AI) at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956, the field of artificial intelligence (AI) research has been carried out, focusing on the development of a machine or system that could think and communicate with humans. Along with the fourth industrial revolution, artificial intelligence (AI) is leading to changes in the industrial structures as well as social changes based on technological innovation. There are challenges for the intelligence information society beyond the discourse in academia. Thus, the purpose of this study is to explore the history and concept of artificial intelligence (AI) focusing on how artificial intelligence will affect labor markets to scrutinize the societal changes due to the development of intelligent information technology. Furthermore, this study describes and provides examples of how artificial intelligence have affected different occupations in the current labor markets. Specifically, to bridge the gap between previous studies which focused on innovation or rationality of the technological development, this study focuses on its impact on the labor market by exploring changes in the employment structure and job tasks. The development of intelligent information technology, so-called 4th Industrial Revolution Technology such as artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), 3D printing, robot, Big Data, Nano technology and Bio Technology etc., is accelerating the change in the social paradigm that makes a big difference in human lifestyle and values. The advent of intelligence information society is expected to be accompanied by the social paradigm and changes in the labor market. Both optimism and pessimism coexist on the labor issues stemming from the spread of artificial intelligence. Regarding changes in the labor market, an optimistic standpoint on technology supports rationality and efficiency in the industry, whereas there are growing concerns over job changes and job losses. Automation indicates that artificial intelligence and machine learning are gradually taking over human jobs. The current physical, mental and cognitive work may be replaced or reduced, which is expected to have significant social and economic repercussions. Particularly, it is likely to become the main characteristics of occupations that can be replaced by artificial intelligence (AI). In addition, it is predicted that the use of artificial intelligence technology will be complementary tools for human–machine collaboration. The reduction in labor costs using the artificial intelligence is becoming a reality in many tasks and re-education and social support are needed to create new jobs. Therefore, the need for redesigning the direction of education for new jobs, supporting system for improvement of labor quality were suggested. It is necessary to have sufficient discussions so that the efficiency and productivity improvement in society as a whole through technological innovation do not lead to social problems such as job losses and spiking the unemployment rate in the labor market in the near future.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Motion and respiration extracted from the radar signal were used. Respiratory signal disturbances by motion artifacts and irregular respiration patterns of sleep apnea patients are compensated for in the preprocessing stage. Preprocessing calculates the standard deviation of the respiration signal for a shift window of 15 seconds to estimate thresholds for compensation and applies it to the breathing signal. The method for estimating the sleep stage is based on the difference in amplitude of two kinds of smoothed respirations signals. In smoothing, the window size is set to 10 seconds and 34 seconds, respectively. The estimated feature was processed by the k-nearest neighbor classifier and the feature filtering model to discriminate between the sleep periods of the rapid eye movement (REM) and non-rapid eye movement (NREM). The feature filtering model reflects the characteristics of the REM sleep that occur continuously and the characteristics that mainly occur in the latter part of this stage. The sleep efficiency is estimated by using the sleep onset time and motion events. Sleep onset time uses estimated features from the gradient changes of the breathing signal. A motion event was applied based on the estimated energy change in the UWB signal.Sleep efficiency and sleep stage accuracy were assessed with polysomnography. The average sleep efficiency and sleep stage accuracy were estimated respectively to be about 96.3% and 88.8% in 18 sleep apnea subjects.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

The structural progressionpattern evaluated by optical coherence tomography guided progression analysis was classified usinghierarchical cluster analysis. The clinical parameters, patterns of structural progression, and visual field (VF)changes were compared among the groups.Results: Three groups were included: stable, progressive peripapillary RNFL thinning without macular GCIPLinvolvement, and progressive thinning of both the peripapillary RNFL and macular GCIPL.

There are several distinguishable architectures of neural networks such as MLP, CNN, and RNN.

As one of the main tasks recently in Natural Language Processing (NLP), we consider Neural Machine Translation (NMT) using RNNs. We also summarize fundamental structures of the recurrent networks, and some topics of representing natural words to reasonable numeric vectors. We organize topics to understand estimation procedures from representing input source sequences to predict target translated sequences. In addition, we apply multiple translation models with Gated Recurrent Unites (GRUs) in Keras on English-Korean sentences that contain about 26,000 pairwise sequences in total from two different corpora, colloquialism and news. We verified some crucial factors that influence the quality of training. We found that loss decreases with more recurrent dimensions and using bidirectional RNN in the encoder when dealing with short sequences.

In particular, the preprocessing result of document big data is a document-word matrix in which rows and columns are composed of documents and words, respectively. Each element of the matrix is the frequency of a word in document. In general, a document-word matrix has a sparse data structure in which many of the elements have a value of zero. The generalized linear model, which is a representative statistical analysis method, presents limitations in the analysis of sparse document-word matrix. To solve such a problem, this paper proposes an analysis method using robust generalized linear model.

For the first stage, the feature vector set is obtained by calculating variances from each frequency bin containing the power spectrum data. The feature set is further reduced in the second stage where an intersection method is used to select more significant features that are finally applied for training a neural network model. A stream of live signals are fed to the trained model which recognizes the abnormal driving behaviors. The driving behaviors considered in this study are weaving, sudden braking and normal driving.

However, k-means struggles to classify datasets without prior knowledge of specific domains. We proposed the repulsive k-means (RK-means) algorithm in a previous study to improve the k-means algorithm, using the repulsive force concept, which allows deleting unnecessary cluster centroids. Accordingly, the RK-means enables to classifying of a dataset without domain knowledge. However, three main problems remain. The RK-means algorithm includes a cluster repulsive force offset, for clusters confined in other clusters, which can cause cluster locking; we were unable to prove RK-means provided optimal convergence in the previous study; and RK-means shown better performance only normalize term and weight. Therefore, this paper proposes the advanced RK-means (ARK-means) algorithm to resolve the RK-means problems. We establish an initialization strategy for deploying cluster centroids and define a metric for the ARK-means algorithm. Finally, we redefine the mass and normalize terms to close to the general dataset. We show ARK-means feasibility experimentally using blob and iris datasets. Experiment results verify the proposed ARK-means algorithm provides better performance than k-means, k’-means, and RK-means.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Thirty healthy male subjects were recruited and asked to perform 23 movements, comprising 14 activities of daily living and nine fall motions. The algorithm was developed using the ANN toolbox provided with MATLAB and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data were used to distinguish between fall and non-fall cases. An IMU sensor was located at the center between the left and right anterior superior iliac spines. A total of 32 feature vectors were extracted from 3-axis acceleration and angular velocity signals. Based on the five different ranking algorithms (relief-F, T-score, correlation, Fisher score, and minimum redundancy maximum relevance) used, feature vector subsets comprising the feature vectors were created and subsequently evaluated. Accuracy was compared according to the number of feature vectors constituting the subset, which were based on rank-lists. The results showed that the subset comprising all the feature vectors showed the best accuracy (99.86%), but a similar accuracy could be obtained with a subset comprising fewer feature vectors. The T-score was found to be the most optimal among the five ranking algorithms. Furthermore, T-score with two feature vectors achieved an accuracy of 99.17%.

Creatinine is an important marker in predicting end-stage renal disease, and it is recorded longitudinally.This study compared the prediction performance of linear regression (LR), linear mixed-effects model (LMM), leastsquares support vector regression (LS-SVR), and mixed-effects least-squares support vector regression (MLS-SVR) methods to predict serum creatinine as a longitudinal outcome. Methods: We used a longitudinal dataset of hemodialysis patients in Hamadan city between 2013 and 2016. To evaluate the performance of the methods in serum creatinine prediction, the data was divided into two sets of training and testing samples. Then LR, LMM, LS-SVR, and MLS-SVR were fitted. The prediction performance was assessed and compared in terms of mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute prediction error (MAPE), and determination coefficient (R2). Variable importance was calculated using the best model to select the most important predictors. Results: The MLS-SVR outperformed the other methods in terms of the least prediction error; MSE = 1.280, MAE = 0.833, and MAPE = 0.129 for the training set and MSE = 3.275, MAE = 1.319, and MAPE = 0.159 for the testing set. Also, the MLS-SVR had the highest R2, 0.805 and 0.654 for both the training and testing samples, respectively. Blood urea nitrogen was the most important factor in the prediction of creatinine.

The Study on Implementation of Crime Terms Classification System for Crime Issues Response,2020,"['Multi-Layer Perceptron', 'Crime', 'Machine Learning', 'Classification', 'NLP']",,"The fear of crime, discussed in the early 1960s in the United States, is a psychological response, such as anxiety or concern about crime, the potential victim of a crime. These anxiety factors lead to the burden of the individual in securing the psychological stability and indirect costs of the crime against the society. Fear of crime is not a good thing, and it is a part that needs to be adjusted so that it cannot be exaggerated and distorted by the policy together with the crime coping and resolution. This is because fear of crime has as much harm as damage caused by criminal act. Eric Pawson has argued that the popular impression of violent crime is not formed because of media reports, but by official statistics. Therefore, the police should watch and analyze news related to fear of crime to reduce the social cost of fear of crime and prepare a preemptive response policy before the people have 'fear of crime'. In this paper, we propose a deep - based news classification system that helps police cope with crimes related to crimes reported in the media efficiently and quickly and precisely. The goal is to establish a system that can quickly identify changes in security issues that are rapidly increasing by categorizing news related to crime among news articles. To construct the system, crime data was learned so that news could be classified according to the type of crime. Deep learning was applied by using Google tensor flow. In the future, it is necessary to continue research on the importance of keyword according to early detection of issues that are rapidly increasing by crime type and the power of the press, and it is also necessary to constantly supplement crime related corpus.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

In the first stage, each suspected smoke region is detected from each frame of the images by using block DNCNN. According to the physical characteristics of smoke diffusion, a concept of visual change image is put forward in this paper, which is constructed by the video motion change state of the suspected smoke regions, and can describe the physical diffusion characteristics of smoke in the time and space domains. In the second stage, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used to classify the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features of visual change images of the suspected smoke regions, in this way to reduce the false alarm caused by the smoke-like objects such as cloud and fog. Simulation experiments are carried out on two public datasets of smoke. Results show that the accuracy and recall rate of smoke detection are high, and the false alarm rate is much lower than that of other comparison methods.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Therefore, this paper proposed an expression recognition framework based on densely concatenated convolutional neural networks to balance accuracy and latency and apply it to humanoid robots. The techniques of feature reuse and parameter compression in the framework improved the learning ability of the model and greatly reduced the parameters.

The reason why artificial intelligence and 3D printing technology are in the spotlight is that the data generated by the technology is in the “digital domain”, but the ripple effects of the data being controlled, modified, improved and developed are useful in creating new value in a variety of industries that are “physical domain”. However, due to the intellectual property law, which failed to respond quickly to the digital information-oriented paradigm in the physical world, which was transformed by the introduction of new technologies, artificial intelligence and 3D printing caused legal gaps and confusion in patent and copyright laws.The reason for this is that the existing legal principles established in the paradigm centered on “human in the physical domain” based on the level of the past technology had limitations in regulating the inventions and creative acts made in a changed environment where the boundaries between the physical and digital worlds blurred. Starting with this awareness, the Intellectual Property Law now needs to explore what needs to be focused on changing from an overly ex post legislative approach to an ex ante approach of how it will affect future market changes and public behavior, using artificial intelligence and 3D printing technologies that bring about innovative changes in the existing paradigm. In particular, legislation from an ex ante perspective will be more important because the impact of the intellectual property law is directly related to the competitiveness and economic growth of related industries. With the advent of new technologies that have led to disruptive innovation, not only the paradigm shift of the intellectual property rights law itself in the traditional attitude and role of jurisprudence, but also the views and perspectives of jurisprudence need to be reformed.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

However, despite their promise, a limitation lies in the fact that a network’s performance quality is based on the data which it receives. A well-trained network will still have poor performance if the subsequent data supplied to it contains artifacts, out of focus regions, or other visual distortions. Under normal circumstances, images of the same scene captured from differing points of focus, angles, or modalities must be separately analysed by the network, despite possibly containing overlapping information such as in the case of images of the same scene captured from different angles, or irrelevant information such as images captured from infrared sensors which can capture thermal information well but not topographical details. This factor can potentially add significantly to the computational time and resources required to utilize the network without providing any additional benefit. In this study, we plan to explore using image fusion techniques to assemble multiple images of the same scene into a single image that retains the most salient key features of the individual source images while discarding overlapping or irrelevant data that does not provide any benefit to the network. Utilizing this image fusion step before inputting a dataset into the network, the number of images would be significantly reduced with the potential to improve the classification performance accuracy by enhancing images while discarding irrelevant and overlapping regions.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

The electrical power system of a vessel consists of one or multiple grids depending on the status (open/closed) of the bus tie. Owing to the complexity of propulsion and electrical power systems, designing the operation method and specifications of the battery onboard the vessel remains a challenge. Therefore, this paper categorizes and analyzes the data according to the condition of the bus tie. Principal component analysis clustering is applied to define the ship operation mode.

"Spatial Downscaling of MODIS Land Surface Temperature: Recent Research Trends, Challenges, and Future Directions",2020,"['land surface temperature', 'spatial downscaling', 'kernel-driven', 'machine learning', 'data fusion', 'MODIS']",,"Satellite-based land surface temperature (LST) has been used as one of the major parameters in various climate and environmental models. Especially, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST is the most widely used satellite-based LST product due to its spatiotemporal coverage (1 km spatial and sub-daily temporal resolutions) and longevity (> 20 years). However, there is an increasing demand for LST products with finer spatial resolution (e.g., 10-250 m) over regions such as urban areas. Therefore, various methods have been proposed to produce high-resolution MODIS-like LST less than 250 m (e.g., 100 m). The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of recent research trends and challenges for the downscaling of MODIS LST. Based on the recent literature survey for the past decade, the downscaling techniques classified into three groups—kernel-driven, fusion-based, and the combination of kernel-driven and fusion-based methods—were reviewed with their pros and cons. Then, five open issues and challenges were discussed: uncertainty in LST retrievals, low thermal contrast, the nonlinearity of LST temporal change, cloud contamination, and model generalization. Future research directions of LST downscaling were finally provided.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

We have replaced a multi class estimator that selects only the most probable one with a multi label estimator such that we are able to see the state of each of the components. We have introduced a measure called certainty so that we are able to represent the symptom and its state. We have built a flow loop for a reciprocating pump system and presented some results. With these changes, we are not only able to detect both the dominant symptom as well as others but also to monitor how the degree of severity of each component changes. About the dominant ones, we found that the overall recognition rate of our algorithm is about 99.7% which is slightly better than that of the former SDMS. Also, we are able to see the trend and to make a base to find prognostics to estimate the remaining useful life. With this we hope that we have gone one step closer to the final goal of prognosis of SDMS.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

We validated our method using our own database and a public database to avoid overtuning. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieved a reliable and promising accuracy in both our own database (98.93%) and the public database (99.78%).

But enough research has not been done to protect the neck. This paper presents an airbag system that recognizes the accident situation with Artifcial Intelligence to protect the driver’s neck area from motorcycle accident situations when driving. In some papers with similar themes, most of them are judged based on a critical point. However, in the case of an accident judgment using the critical point, a malfunction may occur such that the airbag operates when a similar operation is performed, or the airbag does not operate due to failing to pass the critical point at the time of an accident. Artifcial intelligence was used to avoid malfunctions and inconveniences. Artifcial intelligence can solve the problem of malfunction that occurs when it is judged as a critical point and can solve the inconvenience of commercialized products. The CNN presented in this paper can solve these two problems, and the accuracy of accident judgment is as high as 95.75%. Through the MPU 6050 sensor, it operates the airbag by determining the accident situation using the Artifcial Intelligence that was learned in advance through the information on acceleration and angular velocity of the driver’s movements that were measured in real time.

On the Patentability of Artificial Intelligence:a review of recent cases from the U.S.,2020,"['patent eligibility', 'software patent', 'mathematical algorithm', 'artificial intelligence', 'US patent law']",,"As new developments in the field such as neural networks and machine learning have transformed the expectations of AI technology and what it may be capable of, the importance of AI grows exponentially not only in industrial and commercial spheres but also in educational, social and even cultural spheres of our society.Given the importance of AI technology, it follows that the inventors and those involved in the commercialization of the technology would want to protect and exploit the economic value of the technology to its full extent. Obtaining a patent is still one of the most fundamental tools in protecting the economic value of an invention by reserving its exclusive rights to the owner of the patent. However, due to the recent tightening of the requirements in the field of patent law regarding the question of patent-eligibility, it is not entirely clear whether and to what extent AI technology could be patentable. The decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in Alice v CLS Bank and subsequent decisions by the Court of Appeals for Federal Circuit (CAFC) have cast doubt on whether patents that have already been issued for AI satisfy the new tests for patent eligibility and it is difficult to predict with any certainty whether new patent applications in these technologies could satisfy the requirements for patent eligibility due to the fact that these requirements are still in the process of evolution. The traditionally accepted incentive theory would indicate that a strong patent system is the foundation for strong innovation and provides motivation to inventors and offers a known mechanism to evaluate potential returns to potential investors. Although the recent cases have introduced a real element of uncertainty into the system, this will eventually diminish with an accrual of case law through evolving court decisions, and even perhaps new legislation. In the meantime, however, inventors and investors still need to be able to protect their AI technology with patents, even though patents may not necessarily offer a foolproof or ironclad protection they may once seemed to hold out, while knowing that the system was never a guarantee of any value in the invention.This article provides a review of the recent decisions by the courts in the US, including the Federal Circuit on the issue of patentability of AI technology in order to draw out some guidance regarding how inventors and investors should approach this question.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Local Binary Pattern based Defocus Blur Detection using Adaptive Threshold,2020,"['Blur measure', 'Blur segmentation', 'Local binary pattern', 'Support vector machine', 'Adaptive threshold']",,"Enormous methods have been proposed for the detection and segmentation of blur and non-blur regions of the images. Due to the limited available information about the blur type, scenario and the level of blurriness, detection and segmentation is a challenging task. Hence, the performance of the blur measure operators is an essential factor and needs improvement to attain perfection. In this paper, we propose an effective blur measure based on the local binary pattern (LBP) with the adaptive threshold for blur detection. The sharpness metric developed based on LBP uses a fixed threshold irrespective of the blur type and level which may not be suitable for images with large variations in imaging conditions and blur type and level. Contradictory, the proposed measure uses an adaptive threshold for each image based on the image and the blur properties to generate an improved sharpness metric. The adaptive threshold is computed based on the model learned through the support vector machine (SVM). The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using a well-known dataset and compared with five state-of-the-art methods. The comparative analysis reveals that the proposed method performs significantly better qualitatively and quantitatively against all the methods.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Therefore, numerical simulation and probabilistic models have been used for flood prediction, but the methodologies for real-time flood prediction by drainage district in metropolitan areas are still not sufficient. In this study, a flood scenario database was established by using one- and two-dimensional hydraulic analysis models to propose a real-time urban flood prediction method by drainage districts in metropolitan areas. Flood prediction models were constructed for each drainage district through the Nonlinear Auto-Regressive with eXogenous inputs and Self-Organizing Map (NARX-SOM). Suggested prediction model is a data-driven model because it is based on flood database which composed with diverse flood simulation results. To evaluate the predictive capacity of the models, flood prediction was performed for the actual heavy rainfall in 2010 and 2011 that caused severe flooding in Seoul, Republic of Korea. Flood prediction models for a total of 24 drainage districts were constructed, and it was found that the goodness of fit on the flood area ranged from 68.7 to 89.7%.

The relationship between humans and AI is legally important, as there are views that artificial intelligence needs to be recognized as a legal entity and that artificial intelligence needs to be held accountable for its action just like humans. If artificial intelligence has free will, there is no reason to treat AI differently from humans.In order to examine whether AI can have free will, it is necessary to define the concept of free will. Free will can be divided into freedom and will. Freedom means being free from physical causes, but the definition of freedom in this way cannot explain the fact that the brain is governed by the laws of physics. To avoid this inconsistency, freedom can be defined as unpredictability and the unknownness of causes. In reality, we can not distinguish the unknownness of causes from nonexistence of causes. In this respect, the human brain is free, because the causes of the brain's judgment can not be physically identified. Will means a mental state that is motivated to achieve a certain purpose. Motivation means desire and dread, or the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. The desire can be divided into first order desire which is directly related to survival or reproduction and second order desire such as curiosity, desire of power, and the pursuit of wealth. Among these two types of desire, only the second order desire is related to the will. In order to recognize the free will of AI, the information processing of AI should be unpredictable and AI should have second order desires. It is impossible to determine the cause of the AI output value. Therefore, information processing of AI is as free as the human brain. However, the activity of the human brain is more difficult to predict than AI because metacognition and self-awareness, or high level awareness is the key attributes of human mind. It is unclear whether high-level awareness of AI based on metacognition is possible. If high-level thinking of AI is impossible, AI is less free than humans.In order for AI to have a will, it must have desire or dread. While desire and dread are motivations for humans, it is not clear how these motivations are working in the brain's information processing. Therefore, in order to make the algorithm of motivations such as desire and dread, we must first reveal the secrets of the human brain. Unlocking the secrets of the brain eventually means unlocking the secret of the beginning of life, which seems to be difficult in the near future. Even if we reveal the secrets of the brain, it is not certain that the algorithm of motivation can be technically developed. Considering these points, it is difficult for AI to have a will. As a result, AI cannot have free will because it has a lower level of freedom than humans, and it is difficult to have will.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

The random forest technique was used to analyze the impact factors of the construction disaster, and the model was constructed by selecting the factors of high importance from the variables. As a result of comparing the accuracy of the random forest model and the discrimination analysis model in order to verify the constructed construction disaster prediction model, it is found that the random forest model is more accurate than the discrimination analysis model.

PSI-rooted subgraph: A novel feature for IoT botnet detection using classifier algorithms,2020,['IoT botnetIoT securityStatic malware detectionPSI-rooted subgraphMachine learningDeep learning'],,"It is obvious that IoT devices are widely used more and more in many areas. However, due to limited resources (e.g., memory, CPU), the security mechanisms on many IoT devices such as IP-Camera, router are low.

However, Gries (2019) claims that tree-based approaches fail to deal with a data set in which not all input variables are necessary for predicting the target variable accurately. He demonstrates that a tree model reports a three-way interaction even when a two-way interaction can predict the target variable with 100% accuracy because there is another third significant input variable. In this article, I will argue that the result of a conditional inference tree applied to such a data set suggests that a researcher should analyze a two-way interaction effect. In other words, the result allows two different interpretations that are related to the structure of a data set and requires to test whether a two-way interaction is sufficient to explain the data. In doing so, I will show that the presence of the third input variable does not hinder the detection of a perfect two-way interaction that is displayed by a symmetric tree figure.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Traditionally, a qualitative analysis of love-centered lyrics should focus on several typical instances extracted from the whole samples, generalizing the characteristics of a specific writer or brief period. However, with the development of computer science and statistics, it now provides a new perspective for us to elucidate the true meanings behind the natural language texts without human beings’ subjective interpretations.

This relationship is likely to change in the near future with the rapid developments of artificial intelligence. This paper reflects on how the nature of the relationship between the two fields might change in the future. The developments of artificial intelligence presents both opportunities and challenges to cognitive science. First, the developments of artificial intelligence can lead to the deepening of our understandings of human intelligence by assisting cognitive science research. In addition, artificial intelligence can assist human intelligence by providing smart tools with which humans can perform with greater accuracy and efficiency. At the same time, artificial intelligence poses challenges to human intelligence as it is likely to change the information environments in which humans operate and alter the cognitive profiles of human intelligence.

For the closed-loop control, illuminance sensors are generally mounted on a horizontal workplane, or the nearest wall/ceiling. As the size and complexity of an indoor space increases, the number of sensors and its corresponding control become complex because illuminance at a certain point is influenced by multiple neighboring lighting fixtures. The open-loop control is disadvantageous because it can’t reflect the illuminance level of a workplane. With this in mind, the authors aim to develop an approach where lighting simulation model could predict the illuminance level at any points of interest, hereby replacing illuminance sensors, and lead to electric lighting energy savings. For this purpose, Radiance, one of the most sophisticated lighting simulation tools, was first employed for daylit and electric lighting prediction of a target building. Then, a surrogate model, ANN (Artificial Neural Network) model, was developed for fast computation and optimal control. Unknown parameters, e.g. reflectances of ceiling, floor, walls, transmittance of glass and light loss factor, were estimated. It was found that the calibrated model’s prediction is accurate and the proposed approach can save lighting energy by 18.6% for three days’ validation period (Mar 9-12, 2020) conducted at the target building.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Therefore, there are active discussions among countries on how to take legal action against creations created by artificial intelligence. There have been two recent court cases in Chinese courts on creations created by artificial intelligence. One of them had a final decision. It is significant in that the court ruled against a copyright infringement lawsuit against a creation created by artificial intelligence. Therefore, this paper introduces relevant precedents focusing on the Feilin case and Dreamwriter case, which are Chinese court cases on artificial intelligence creations. We examined China's attitude toward artificial intelligence creations through a legal review of the requirements for the establishment of works and the status of authors under the Chinese Copyright Law. AI, which appeared in the two cases, was an weak artificial intelligence stage, based on the assumption that human participation was involved when the final results were produced. The Chinese court denied the identity of the artificial intelligence creation, but recognized it as a work. However, if strong artificial intelligence appears, the current Chinese court cases alone will still not give the answer.

The problems of human-centered industrialization and west-centered modernization have caused problems of vision of life and environmental damage. Jang Ilsoon presents the ecological world view in an attempt to solve the underlying problem based on existential reflection. This is one, but all in all, one world view of holism, the world view of spirituality. This is similar to the deep ecology of the West.

This is to characterize text types in lexical units. Although vocabulary is the only entity in the text, it has been neglected in previous research. This is because time and effort were limited in analyzing text at the lexical level. Text mining techniques that deal with big data will reduce this effort. In addition, it is expected that the study of texts in the lexical unit wii be activated in the future.The data used in this study were taken from the online edition of Handelsblatt and from Börse Online, the internet media in Germany, and from Daum’s financial news in Korea. The second half of 2017 is on the uptrend, based on securities firms’ stock market charts. The 2018 interval is set for the downtrend. R and AntConc programs were used to work with word cloud and language statistics.The most frequent vocabulary that appeared in the closing report did not show a big difference in the ranking even if the trend changed. However, the vocabulary groups of the Up and Down were found to have different frequency rankings as time changed. Therefore, it is judged that certain vocabulary groups can be fluidly observed depending on the text types.

In order to solve this problem, the forecasting of oil spill has been carried out by expanding the particle prediction, which is an existing study that studies the movement of floats on the sea using the data of the float. In the ocean data format HDF5, the current and wind velocity data at a specific location were extracted using bilinear interpolation, and then the movement of numerous points was predicted by particles and the results were visualized using polygons and heat maps. In addition, we propose a spill oil particle matching algorithm to compensate for the lack of data and the difference between the spilled oil and movement. The spilled oil particle matching algorithm is an algorithm that tracks the movement of particles by granulating the appearance of surface oil spilled oil. The problem was segmented using principal component analysis and matched using genetic algorithm to the point where the variance of travel distance of effluent oil is minimized. As a result of verifying the effluent oil visualization data, it was confirmed that the particle matching algorithm using principal component analysis and genetic algorithm showed the best performance, and the mean data error was 3.2%.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv
A Novel Network Anomaly Detection Method based on Data Balancing and Recursive Feature Addition,2020,"['Network anomaly detection', 'data balancing', 'recursive feature addition', 'parameters combination optimization', 'random forests']",,"Network anomaly detection system plays an essential role in detecting network anomaly and ensuring network security. Anomaly detection system based machine learning has become an increasingly popular solution.

To address this problem, a new network anomaly detection method based on data balancing and recursive feature addition is proposed. Firstly, data balancing algorithm based on improved KNN outlier detection is designed to select part respective data on each category. Combination optimization about parameters of improved KNN outlier detection is implemented by genetic algorithm. Next, recursive feature addition algorithm based on correlation analysis is proposed to select effective features, in which a cross contingency test is utilized to analyze correlation and obtain a features subset with a strong correlation. Then, random forests model is as the classification model to detection anomaly. Finally, the proposed algorithm is evaluated on benchmark datasets KDD Cup 1999 and UNSW_NB15.

For example, we are often confronted by new vocabularies such as Fourth Industrial Revolution, Deep Learning, Big Data, AlphaGo and Autonomous Driving which are closely linked to artificial intelligence through various mass media in everyday life. This means that in contemporary society, artificial intelligence is in high demand; hence, it is usually considered an icon and symbol of not only the most advanced technology but also the most efficient and creative invention for human societies. However, some warnings and alerts have also been raised about the gradual replacement of every aspects of all human spheres by artificial intelligence to sustain social and cultural values such as kinship, social rituals and religion in traditional human societies. In that sense, Huxley’s early 20thcentury novel Brave New World reflects the importance of these social and cultural elements in traditional human societies. Thus, in this paper, I analyze some perspectives on the era of artificial intelligence that are embedded within Huxley’s novel, focusing on the ”body“. As far as kinship is concerned, cybots do not have a kinship network. This is because cybots are normally manufactured like machines in large quantities, whereas humans are bound together with kinship either by birth (consanguineal kinship) or by marriage (affinal kinship). Along the same lines, in Huxley’s description of mass reproduction, most babies are born through artificial insemination and are classified into five social classes through the manipulation of genes as well as the developmental environment. Therefore, the future humans in Huxley’s novel do not establish kin memberships such as father, mother, son, and daughter. Thus, they do not keep equivalent kinship terms. In comparison, the aborigines in Huxley’s novel maintain traditional human values such as kinship and kinship terms. In addition, as far as social rituals and religion are concerned, the future human society in Brave New World shows that all humans share everything with other humans; thus, every man can love every woman and vice versa. There exists neither marriage nor any restrictions. In addition, Huxley’s novel portrays death as a cheerful moment, where corpses are cremated and only leave phosphorus fertilizer for the soil. Hence, future humans do not share feelings of awe towards the human spirit and ancestor worship. In this context, future humans in Brave New World currently look like cybots. In other words, we usually believe that the bodies of cybots do not consist of symbolic elements of human kinship, such as bone, blood and flesh. Furthermore, in traditional societies, the human body is often cosmologically divided into the physical body and the spirit after death. Last, Huxley’s novel Brave New World could raise a fresh alarm in the era of artificial intelligence, that is, artificial intelligence is continuously developed to provide ultimate efficiency and convenience for humans. However, like the civilized human society in Brave New World, the immoderately fast-growing development of artificial intelligence in contemporary society will bring a deterioration of humanity and of traditional human values such as kinship, rituals, and religion.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Collaborative filtering (CF) is the most commonly used algorithm for implementing recommender systems. However, in most cases, it only uses purchase history or customer ratings, even though customers provide numerous other data that are available. E-commerce customers frequently use a search function to find the products in which they are interested among the vast array of products offered. Such search keyword data may be a very useful information source for modeling customer preferences. However, it is rarely used as a source of information for recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid CF model based on the Doc2Vec algorithm using search keywords and purchase history data of online shopping mall customers. To validate the applicability of the proposed model, we empirically tested its performance using real-world online shopping mall data from Korea. As the number of recommended products increases, the recommendation performance of the proposed CF (or, hybrid CF based on the customer’s search keywords) is improved. On the other hand, the performance of a conventional CF gradually decreased as the number of recommended products increased. As a result, we found that using search keyword data effectively represents customer preferences and might contribute to an improvement in conventional CF recommender systems.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

This study aims to suggest a machine learning algorithm to improve the trading performance of an intraday short volatility strategy applying asymmetric volatility spillover effect, and analyze its trading performance improvement.  Generally stock market volatility has a negative relation with stock market return and the Korean stock market volatility is influenced by the US stock market volatility. This volatility spillover effect is asymmetric. The asymmetric volatility spillover effect refers to the phenomenon that the US stock market volatility up and down differently influence the next day’s volatility of the Korean stock market. We collected the S&P 500 index, VIX, KOSPI 200 index, and V-KOSPI 200 from 2008 to 2018. We found the negative relation between the S&P 500 and VIX, and the KOSPI 200 and V-KOSPI 200. We also documented the strong volatility spillover effect from the VIX to the V-KOSPI 200. Interestingly, the asymmetric volatility spillover was also found. Whereas the VIX up is fully reflected in the opening volatility of the V-KOSPI 200, the VIX down influences partially in the opening volatility and its influence lasts to the Korean market close. If the stock market is efficient, there is no reason why there exists the asymmetric volatility spillover effect. It is a counter example of the efficient market hypothesis.  To utilize this type of anomalous volatility spillover pattern, we analyzed the intraday volatility selling strategy. This strategy sells short the Korean volatility market in the morning after the US stock market volatility closes down and takes no position in the volatility market after the VIX closes up. It produced profit every year between 2008 and 2018 and the percent profitable is 68%. The trading performance showed the higher average annual return of 129% relative to the benchmark average annual return of 33%. The maximum draw down, MDD, is -41%, which is lower than that of benchmark -101%. The Sharpe ratio 0.32 of SVS strategy is much greater than the Sharpe ratio 0.08 of the Benchmark strategy. The Sharpe ratio simultaneously considers return and risk and is calculated as return divided by risk. Therefore, high Sharpe ratio means high performance when comparing different strategies with different risk and return structure. Real world trading gives rise to the trading costs including brokerage cost and slippage cost. When the trading cost is considered, the performance difference between 76% and -10% average annual returns becomes clear.  To improve the performance of the suggested volatility trading strategy, we used the well-known SVM algorithm. Input variables include the VIX close to close return at day t-1, the VIX open to close return at day t-1, the VK open return at day t, and output is the up and down classification of the VK open to close return at day t. The training period is from 2008 to 2014 and the testing period is from 2015 to 2018. The kernel functions are linear function, radial basis function, and polynomial function. We suggested the modified-short volatility strategy that sells the VK in the morning when the SVM output is Down and takes no position when the SVM output is Up. The trading performance was remarkably improved. The 5-year testing period trading results of the m-SVS strategy showed very high profit and low risk relative to the benchmark SVS strategy. The annual return of the m-SVS strategy is 123% and it is higher than that of SVS strategy. The risk factor, MDD, was also significantly improved from -41% to –29%.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Through the weights derived during the dimensional reduction process, the important points of data in each reduced dimensional axis are identified. Each dimension axis has a different weight in the total data according to the size of the eigenvalue of the axis. Accordingly, a weight proportional to the size of the eigenvalues of each dimension axis is given, and an operation process is performed to add important points of data in each dimension axis. The critical area of the data is calculated by applying a threshold to the data obtained through the calculation process. After that, induces reverse mapping to the original data in the important area of the derived data, and selects the important area in the original data space.

There were two main backgrounds for this proposal. First, there has been a vacancy in the aspect of morphological analysis in the grammar description that has been used in mainstream syntax. Second, there was a limit to the way that has improved the performance of the morphological analyzer through learning based on individual examples.  Constraints on the arrangement of adjacent components must take both concrete usage and abstract explanatory power. The constraints should be set relatively freely from the previous syntax rules and lexical constraints, and it must be formulated to increase the effectiveness of the description. This paper describes these constraints as a regular expression expressing a syntactic relationship.  If the Korean academia continues to review and accumulate these regular expressions, the following effects will be obtained.

Risk prediction and marker selection in nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms using whole genome sequencing data,2020,"['Breeding', 'deleterious effect', 'marker selection', 'nsSNP', 'risk prediction']",,"Despite the various existing studies about nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs), genome-wide studies based on nsSNPs are rare. NsSNPs alter amino acid sequences, affect protein structure and function, and have deleterious effects. By predicting the deleterious effect of nsSNPs, we determined the total risk score per individual. Additionally, the machine learning technique was utilized to find an optimal nsSNP subset that best explains the complete nsSNP effect. A total of 16,100 nsSNPs were selected as the best representatives among 89,519 regressed nsSNPs. In the gene ontology analysis encompassing the 16,100 nsSNPs, DNA metabolic process, chemokine- and immune-related, and reproduction were the most enriched terms. We expect that our risk score prediction and nsSNP marker selection will contribute to future development of extant genome-wide association studies and breeding science more broadly.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Artificial neural networks (ANN) is a field of machine learning that mimics the neural network of living organisms. They show good performance in pattern recognition. Although researches has been using ANNs to estimate the DoAs, there are limitations in dealing with variations of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the target signals. In this paper, we propose a three-stage ANN algorithm for DoA estimation. The proposed algorithm can minimize the performance reduction by applying the model trained in a single SNR environment to various environments through a ‘noise reduction process’. Furthermore, the scheme reduces the difficulty in learning and maintains efficiency in estimation, by employing a process of DoA shift. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) and the performances of existing subspace-based algorithms and show that the proposed scheme exhibits better performance than other schemes in some severe environments such as low SNR environments or situations in which targets are located very close to each other.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

In the early 1950s, North Korea pursued rapid post-war restoration and industrialization through the aid of socialist countries such as the Soviet Union. Therefore, it was also a period when learning the Soviet Union was most emphasized. However, in response to Soviet intervention in the mid-1950s, the North Korean regime tried to escape from Soviet influence. The Soviet Union also pressed North Korea by drastically reducing aid to North Korea. As a result, North Korea pursued an “independent economy” that could operate without the help of the Soviet Union. This series of changes was most realized by the workers in the production site. During the post-war restoration period, large amounts of aid were received from the Soviet Union, and most of them were introduced into the industrial field in the form of various machines, facilities, factories, technologies and work methods. Therefore, workers had to learn and adapt to new machines, technologies and working methods. In the process, North Korean workers had to resolve problems arising from the use of Soviet machinery. There were workers who had adapted easily, but there were also workers who adhered to the machines and working methods that were familiar to the past. Amid a sharp decline in Soviet aid, the first five-year plan focused on heavy industry demanded active and dedicated efforts from workers. A sharp drop in aid meant a shortage of foreign currency, so workers had to save supplies in all directions. In particular, efforts to conserve fuel such as coal and gasoline, which were dependent on imports, were made great efforts. Workers had to use anthracite that could be produced in North Korea to replace imported coal, and to reduce the use of gasoline, they created cars that run on alternative fuels. In addition, the localization of various machinery and equipment, which depended on imports, also proceeded in earnest. Thanks to the growth of the machinery industry, workers in this period succeeded in producing automobiles and tractors with only their own skills and efforts.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

In the first stage, we introduce a modified damage identification technique based on frequencies using <i>nMSEDI</i> to locate the potential of damaged elements. In the second stage, after eliminating the healthy elements, the damage index values from <i>nMSEDI</i> are considered as input in the damage quantification algorithm. The hybrid of Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are used along with nMSEDI.

Among these technologies, one of the artificial intelligence techniques, the deep learning technique is used.As another method, a method of detecting an object using a stereo vision camera is also used. However, these techniques require expensive hardware equipment because of the computational complexity of used to detect objects. However, most video equipments have a significant decrease in computational processing power, and thus, in order to detect passengers on the bus, there is a need for an image processing technology suitable for various equipment using a relatively low computational technique. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a technique that can efficiently obtain the number of passengers on the bus by detecting the contour of the object through the background subtraction suitable for low-cost equipment. Experiments have shown that passengers were counted with approximately 70% accuracy on lower-end machines than those equipped with stereo vision camera.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

However, discoveries about how languages change are being made through computational linguistics using the vast amount of language data available to overcome these difficulties. Machine learning can be used to understand how languages change by reconstructing languages and analyzing diachronic corpuses from different periods.

Then we conducted a regression analysis on the document-topic distributions generated by LDA to identify hot and cold topics. We discovered 2 hot topics(internationalization capacity and performance of export companies, economic effect of trade) and 2 cold topics(exchange rate and current account, trade finance).

First, based on local parameter estimation, autoregressive (AR) model analysis and local estimation of the increase in image blur, we extract features from the weather images using an approach inspired by free energy and a no-reference robust metric model. Next, we compare the coefficient energy and contrast difference of each pixel in the AR model and then use the percentages to calculate the image sharpness to derive the overall mass fraction. Furthermore, the results are compared. The relationship between residual value and PM2.5 concentration is fitted by generalized Gauss distribution (GGD) model.

This was achieved using gas chromatography (GC) coupled with a flame ionization detector (FID) and mass spectrometry (MS). Following appropriate examination of all the peaks in 71 samples, 166 impurities were selected as the characteristic components. Unsupervised (principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and K-means clustering) and supervised (partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), support vector machines (SVM), and deep neural network (DNN) with Keras) chemometric techniques were employed for classifying the 71 MA seizures. The results of the PCA, HCA, K-means clustering, PLS-DA, OPLS-DA, SVM, and DNN methods for quality evaluation were in good agreement. However, the tested MA seizures possessed distinct features, such as chirality, cutting agents, and boiling points. The study indicated that the established qualitative and semi-quantitative methods will be practical and useful analytical tools for characterizing trace compounds in illicit MA seizures. Moreover, they will provide a statistical basis for identifying the synthesis route, sources of supply, trafficking routes, and connections between seizures, which will support drug law enforcement agencies in their effort to eliminate organized MA crime.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv
Word2Vec 분석을 통한 근대 계몽기 잡지에서의 ‘문명(文明)’의 시기별 지형도,2020,"['문명', 'Word2Vec', '사회진화론', '경제사회', '심리적 구조', 'Civilization', 'Social Evolution', 'Economic Society', 'Psychological Structure']",,"This study examines the characteristics of the concept of ‘civilization’ by period, using a Word2Vec methodology, targeting 11 Korean articles written in Chinese script which were published in modern enlightenment magazines between 1906 and 1910. The meaning field of ‘civilization’ across this period was characterized through a ‘top-down’ analysis of the keyword “civilization” together with a list of synonyms adduced by machine learning, using an unsupervised learning algorithm called ‘Word2Vec’.Between 1906 and 1910, the relative usage of the concept of 'civilization' fluctuated greatly, rising sharply until 1908, and falling sharply after 1909. At the peak, in 1908, terms related to evolutionary development and the market economy formed a dense list of synonyms. But In 1909 and 1910, various terms occurred which could not be clustered or which differ in character when compared to the earlier period.Based on these characteristics, the features of the meaning of ‘civilization’ in the targeted articles can be summarized as follows: First, those related to social evolution and Asianism. Second, those related to the economic field and daily discourse. Third, those related to the formation of discipline and character and the formation of an aesthetic disposition. These characteristics show how the internal and psychological process of civilization follows the external and structural process of civilization.The concept of civilization has previously been discussed in close connection with the discourse of the nation-state as one of the characteristics of modernity, but this study confirms that the concept of civilization is also inextricably related to the establishment of the modern economic field. Also, in 1909 and 1910, among the terms that formed a significant relationship with civilization, many were identified which relate to literature and art. This shows the relationship between the liberal arts, cultivated discourse and civilization, due to the functional division of society and the entanglement of human relationships.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

The model that predicts wave height can roughly be categorized into two methods, namely, a numerical method that calculates by physical formula and a soft-computing method that collects weather information and learns the machine learning algorithm. These models are difficult to apply in the real world because of their high computational complexity and the use of expensive radar equipment. In this study, we propose to estimate the wave height in real time using the images of the ocean. We used the image data consisting of four consecutive images instead of a single image and applied the combination of convolutional LSTM and 3D CNN networks that can best handle the data structure as a regression model. In this way of prediction, existing methods are not only outperformed but are also more robust to outliers.

The ethical debate on human lies proceeded from the obligatory, utilitarian, and virtuous ethical perspectives. Based on the human lies defined in these three points of view, artificial intelligence lies can be applied in a limited way to the obligatory, utilitarian, and virtuous ethical perspectives that define human lies. However, the lies of artificial intelligence cannot be completely defined by these three perspectives because the machine learning process of artificial intelligence cannot be analyzed. Lies of artificial intelligence can reflect the characteristics of each of these by the deontological, utilitarian, and virtuous ethical data, which are the requirements for the analysis of human lies. However, artificial intelligence lies have certain characteristics that can define human lies. Currently, no expression can define characteristics beyond the scope of human lies, but it is evident that it goes beyond the scope of artificial intelligence lies.This study can be a stepping stone in finding the standard point of view to define ‘artificial intelligence lies’ by comparing artificial intelligence lies with human lies.

Improvement of the Rapid-Development Thunderstorm (RDT) Algorithm for Use with the GK2A Satellite,2020,['Thunderstorm . Detecting convective cells . Nowcasting . Lightning verification'],,"New technologies for the classification of convective cloud lifecycles and the prediction of their movements are needed to detect severe convective weather and to support objective cloud guidance. Satellites enable earlier detection of severe weather over larger coverage areas than ground-based observations or radar. The use of satellite observations for nowcasting is thus likely. In this study, convective initiation (CI) data are paired with a modified rapid-development thunderstorm (RDT) algorithm for the analysis of new data from the Geostationary Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite-2A (GEO-KOMPSAT-2A, GK2A). The RDT algorithm is further modified to accommodate the additional GK2A satellite channels, and new satellite data are used to continuously analyze thunderstorms associated with severe weather in Korea. The logistic regression (LR) machine learning approach is used to optimize the criteria of interest fields and weighting coefficients of the RDT algorithm for convective detection. In addition, auxiliary data (cloud type, convective rainfall rate, and cloud top temperature/height) calculated from RDTsub-module is replaced with GK2A derived products. The fullymodified RDTalgorithm(K-RDT) is quantitatively verified using lightning data from summer convection cases. The probability of detection (POD) for convective clouds is increased by 30– 40%, and the threat score (TS) for average lightning activity is improved by 10–30%. The channel properties of Japan Himawari- 8 satellite are similar to those of the GK2A satellite.

While these studies have accumulated increasingly refined evidence on PM2.5-health associations, the needs for more advanced PM2.5 exposure models have also grown. For the last two decades, PM2.5 estimation approaches using satellite remote sensing have been developed and advanced, taking advantage of quantitative aerosol data (e.g., aerosol optical depth; AOD), the development of satellite instruments and data retrieval algorithms, and the application of statistical and machine learning techniques. Subsequently, the satellite-based PM2.5 concentrations have contributed to health effect studies by providing spatially resolved exposure estimates of ambient PM2.5 and thus reducing exposure misclassification.

We compared genetic variants and classified them as concordant, primary-specific, and metastasis-specific variants. We used a combination of principal components analysis and clustering to find genomic groups. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to appraise survival between genomic groups. We used machine learning to confirm the correlation between genetic variants and metastatic sites.Results A total of 282 types of deleterious non-synonymous variants were selected for analysis. Of a total of 897 variants, an average of 40% was discordant. Three genomic groups were yielded based on the genomic discrepancy patterns. Overall survival differed significantly between the genomic groups. The poorest group had the highest proportion of concordant KRAS G12V and additional metastasis-specific SMAD4. Correlation analysis between genetic variants and metastatic sites suggested that concordant KRAS mutations would have more disseminated metastases.Conclusion Driver gene mutations were mostly concordant; however, discordant or metastasis-specific mutations were present.

Poultry farm vehicle movements as risk factors for the 2014/15 highly pathogenic avian influenza epidemics in the Republic of Korea,2020,"['Highly pathogenic avian influenza', 'BRT', 'GLM', 'risk factors', 'Republic of Korea']",,"Since the first HPAI epidemics in 2003, there has been little epidemiological research on the association between HPAI epidemics and vehicle movements around poultry farms. This study examined the relationship between vehicle movements around poultry farms and the 2014/15 HPAI epidemics in the Republic of Korea using two methods: a boosted regression trees (BRT) model and logistic regression of a generalized linear model (GLM). The BRT model considers the non-linearity association between the frequency of vehicle movements around poultry farms and the HPAI outbreak status per province using a machine learning technique. In contrast, a GLM assesses the relationship based on the traditional frequentist method. Among the three types of vehicle movements (outbound, inbound, and within), only the outbound was found to be a risk factor of the 2014/15 HPAI epidemics according to both the BRT model and multivariate logistic regression of GLM. In the BRT model results, the median relative contribution of the log-transformed outbound variable was 53.68 (range: 39.99 – 67.58) in the 2014 epidemics and 49.79 (range: 33.90 – 56.38) in the 2015 epidemics. In the GLM results, the odds ratio of the log-transformed outbound variable was 1.22 for the 2014 HPAI epidemics (p < 0.001) and 2.48 for the 2015 HPAI epidemics (p < 0.001), respectively. The results indicated that intensive disinfection measures on outbound movement were needed to reduce the risk of HPAI spread. The current BRT models are suitable for risk analysis because the median area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.83 (range: 0.74 – 0.91) and 0.85 (range: 0.73 – 0.87) for the 2014 and 2015 epidemics models, respectively. The Akaike information criterion scores for the multivariate logistic regression of GLM were 150.27 and 78.21 for the 2014 and 2015 epidemics models, respectively.

The results of this study show that ‘Tone Analyzer’ has an agreement rate of about 67%, while the agreement rate of ‘KH-Coder’ is about 57%. That is, the result of ‘Tone Analyzer’ adapting a machine learning method is more accurate than that of ‘KH-Coder’, which is based on a sentiment dictionary method. Additionally, sentiment words, possible explicit cues to infer a correct answer, appeared in most of the 60 items. However, in the case of an item where any sentiment words were not directly presented, both sentiment analysis tools mostly failed to find the correct answer.

In the process of gathering and processing data, bias is always raised.In this study, the bias of data is divided into the bias of the data itself and the bias of the data processing.

This objectivity can be secured only when subjective intervention is excluded in the process of data acquisition. Nevertheless, even if this modern mechanical objectivity is guaranteed, problems arise that may not be fair. The objectivity of data will be discussed in the process of acquiring data itself, but the fairness of data is more problematic in the use of data.Therefore, in terms of data ethics, the meaning of population bias, data bias, data objectivity, and data fairness should be clearly defined in the process of collecting and using big data.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Haar-wavelet transform (HWT) is applied to preserve the information of the features before reducing the data dimension. Dimension reduction using an averaging algorithm is also applied to decrease the computational cost, which provides faster performance while maintaining high accuracy. Before the classification, a proposed thresholding method with inverse HWT is conducted to extract the final feature set.

Towards bearing failure prognostics: a practical comparison between datadriven methods for industrial applications,2020,['· Bearing failure prognostics · Deep belief networks · Gaussian process regression · Health indicator construction · Monotonicity'],,"Research studies on data-driven approaches to rotating components and rolling element bearing (REB) prognostics have recently witnessed a rapid increase. These datadriven methods rely on sensor data for condition monitoring and degradation assessments;however, the problem of mining features from these sophisticated data using appropriate intelligent methods and choosing a practically reliable predictive model(s) has become a global concern. Vibration monitoring for REBs have over the years shown great effectiveness.Although monotonic statistical features serve as reliable health indicators (HIs), relying on a single feature for optimal bearing degradation assessment is inefficient. By fusing highly monotonic features using appropriate methods, a more reliable HI can be constructed and from this, various degradation states/stages and time to start prediction (TSP) can be identified by mapping known failure modes/degradation states to cluster points from clustering algorithms.Emphatically, the choice of regression algorithms for prognostics poses more concern as engineers and data scientists are faced with choosing between Bayessian machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods. This study presents a methodology for constructing a reliable HI for bearing prognostics, choosing a reliable TSP, and provides a comparison between ML and DL methods for bearing prognostics.

Human-swarm Interactions for Formation Control Using Interpreters,2020,"['Distributed control', 'dynamic average consensus', 'formation control', 'human-swarm interaction', 'shape morphing dynamics', 'shape planning.']",,"In this work, we develop a novel Human-Swarm Interaction (HSI) framework for formation control using the notion of an interpreter, enabling the user to control a robotic swarm’s shape and formation using abstraction. The user conveys their intended commands by drawing shapes through arm gestures and motions which arerecorded by an off-the-shelf wearable device. We propose a novel interpreter system, which acts as an intermediary between the user and the swarm to simplify the roles of both. The interpreter takes in high level input in the form of shapes drawn by the user, and translates it into swarm control commands by planning in the shape space using novel shape morphing dynamics (SMD), which is also used for user feedback. The proposed interpreter employs machine learning, estimation and optimal control techniques to translate the users intention into swarm control parameters. The dynamics of the swarm are realized by means of a novel decentralized formation controller based on distributed linear iterations and dynamic average consensus. Theoretical guarantees of convergence along with convergence rate of the proposed swarm controller are given. The resulting shape morphing dynamics are illustrated and discussed through simulations. The entire framework is demonstrated theoretically as well as experimentally in a 2D environment, with a human controlling a swarm of simulated robots in real time with the help of a Graphical User Environemnt (GUI).",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

This war had many characteristics of modern warfare, such as using machine guns, telegraphy and railroads. In this war the destructive power of weapons grew and the speed of communication and movement became faster, and massive troops were able to operate for several weeks on the front line of 150 km. One notable point in this war is that the result of the main combats or operations was greatly influenced by commands’ military strategic concept or ways of war fighting rather than the superiority of combat power. Also, there were cases where the victor suffered heavier damage than the loser.  The majority of studies on this war in Korea focus on the political backgrounds of the war, military incidents related to Korea, Russia and Japan’s war preparations, or military strategy itself. However, little attention has been paid to the formerly-mentioned phenomena of this war. This research, therefore, focuses on analyzing both Russia and Japan’s military activities in the operational aspect of military strategy. That is, it aims to analyze the ground warfare and military actions in Manchuria while focusing on the effective use of combats for achievement of military goals and the operational viewpoint of military strategy and commands’ operational thinking.  This research has resulted in two findings. First, a military strategy of exchanging territory and force for time is efficient only when it is accompanied by military actions which inflict serious damage on the enemy. Second, repetitive and patterned actions give the enemy an opportunity to learn from and react to them in a creative way.  In conclusion, the commanding officers could have carried out military actions more and efficiently if they had commanded with a better understanding of the transformation of weapons and the change in the size of armed forces, and the creative ways.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Computational estimation of the earthquake response for fibre reinforced concrete rectangular columns,2020,"['ANFIS', 'PSO', 'GA', 'ELM', 'fibre-reinforced concrete', 'Seismic response', 'compressive strength']",,"Due to the impressive flexural performance, enhanced compressive strength and more constrained crack propagation, Fibre-reinforced concrete (FRC) have been widely employed in the construction application. Majority of experimental studies have focused on the seismic behavior of FRC columns. Based on the valid experimental data obtained from the previous studies, the current study has evaluated the seismic response and compressive strength of FRC rectangular columns while following hybrid metaheuristic techniques. Due to the non-linearity of seismic data, Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) has been incorporated with metaheuristic algorithms. 317 different datasets from FRC column tests has been applied as one database in order to determine the most influential factor on the ultimate strengths of FRC rectangular columns subjected to the simulated seismic loading. ANFIS has been used with the incorporation of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic algorithm (GA). For the analysis of the attained results, Extreme learning machine (ELM) as an authentic prediction method has been concurrently used. The variable selection procedure is to choose the most dominant parameters affecting the ultimate strengths of FRC rectangular columns subjected to simulated seismic loading. Accordingly, the results have shown that ANFIS-PSO has successfully predicted the seismic lateral load with R2 = 0.857 and 0.902 for the test and train phase, respectively, nominated as the lateral load prediction estimator. On the other hand, in case of compressive strength prediction, ELM is to predict the compressive strength with R2 = 0.657 and 0.862 for test and train phase, respectively. The results have shown that the seismic lateral force trend is more predictable than the compressive strength of FRC rectangular columns, in which the best results belong to the lateral force prediction. Compressive strength prediction has illustrated a significant deviation above 40 Mpa which could be related to the considerable non-linearity and possible empirical shortcomings. Finally, employing ANFIS-GA and ANFIS-PSO techniques to evaluate the seismic response of FRC are a promising reliable approach to be replaced for high cost and time-consuming experimental tests.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv
A review of the application of multispectral remote sensing in the study of mangrove ecosystems with special emphasis on image processing techniques,2020,['Remote sensing Sensors Mangrove ecosystem Change detection Stress Vegetation Index'],,"Much progress has been made since the first published report on application of remote sensing in mangrove mapping nearly 40 years ago. Remote sensing is now a widely used proxy in mangrove ecosystem related research mostly due to increased affordability of data and ease of access. This work reviews previous works on mangrove forests using remote sensing techniques with an aim to identify the best combinations of sensors, methods of image processing and vegetation indices for future studies. It was observed that higher accuracies were directly related to sensor resolution and expertise of the authors. From the imageries used, Quickbird had the highest accuracies (* 100%) whereas aerial photos had * 93% accuracy and IRS LISS recorded (76–97%).Accuracies for Landsat images classified using hybrid approaches were up to 88% while AVIRIS and ASTER, gave up to 99% accuracies. Sentinel images also produced very high accuracy levels. Non parametric methods using machine learning techniques produced the highest levels of accuracy (up to 99%). But not all datasets are freely available and the cost of procuring datasets varies from country to country. This suggests that remote sensing of mangrove vegetation pose some serious challenges that require careful considerations in order to obtain better results. An in-depth understanding of the factors affecting the interaction between electro-magnetic radiation and mangrove vegetations in the environment, selection of images with appropriate spatial and spectral resolution and use of proper processing techniques for extracting spectral information is a must. This review paper thus, can be considered as a convenient asset to the researchers involved in assessing the mangrove environment by remote sensing technique.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

The focal uptake in the thyroid gland was drawn in 3D with 40% SUVmax threshold. Features were extracted from volume of interest (VOI) using the LIFEx package. The features obtained were compared in benign and malignant groups, and statistically significant variables were evaluated by receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis. The correlation between the variables with area under curve (AUC) value over 0.7 was examined; variables with correlation coefficient less than 0.6 were evaluated with machine learning algorithms.Results Sixty patients (70% train set, 30% test set) were included in the study. In univariate analysis, a statistically significant difference was observed in 6 conventional parameters, 5 first-, and 16 second-order features between benign and malignant groups in train set (p < 0.05). The feature with the highest benign-malignant discriminating power was GLRLMRLNU (AUC:0.827). AUC value of SUVmax was calculated as 0.758. GLRLMRLNU and SUVmax were evaluated to build a model to predict the exact pathology outcome. Random forest algorithm showed the best accuracy and AUC (78.6% and 0.849, respectively).Conclusion In the differentiation of benign-malignant thyroid incidentalomas, GLRLMRLNU and SUVmax combination may be more useful than SUVmax to predict the outcome.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv
Extending TextAE for annotation of non-contiguous entities,2020,"['editor', 'text annotation', 'text mining', 'visualization']",,"Named entity recognition tools are used to identify mentions of biomedical entities in free text and are essential components of high-quality information retrieval and extraction systems. Without good entity recognition, methods will mislabel searched text and will miss important information or identify spurious text that will frustrate users. Most tools do not capture non-contiguous entities which are separate spans of text that together refer to an entity, e.g., the entity ""type 1 diabetes"" in the phrase ""type 1 and type 2 diabetes."" This type is commonly found in biomedical texts, especially in lists, where multiple biomedical entities are named in shortened form to avoid repeating words. Most text annotation systems, that enable users to view and edit entity annotations, do not support non-contiguous entities. Therefore, experts cannot even visualize non-contiguous entities, let alone annotate them to build valuable datasets for machine learning methods. To combat this problem and as part of the BLAH6 hackathon, we extended the TextAE platform to allow visualization and annotation of non-contiguous entities. This enables users to add new subspans to existing entities by selecting additional text. We integrate this new functionality with TextAE's existing editing functionality to allow easy changes to entity annotation and editing of relation annotations involving non-contiguous entities, with importing and exporting to the PubAnnotation format. Finally, we roughly quantify the problem across the entire accessible biomedical literature to highlight that there are a substantial number of non-contiguous entities that appear in lists that would be missed by most text mining systems.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

As a result, preventing customers from churn is becoming a more important business issue than securing new customers. This is because maintaining churn customers is far more economical than securing new customers, and in fact, the acquisition cost of new customers is known to be five to six times higher than the maintenance cost of churn customers. Also, Companies that effectively prevent customer churn and improve customer retention rates are known to have a positive effect on not only increasing the companys profitability but also improving its brand image by improving customer satisfaction.  Predicting customer churn, which had been conducted as a sub-research area for CRM, has recently become more important as a big data-based performance marketing theme due to the development of business machine learning technology. Until now, research on customer churn prediction has been carried out actively in such sectors as the mobile telecommunication industry, the financial industry, the distribution industry, and the game industry, which are highly competitive and urgent to manage churn. In addition, These churn prediction studies were focused on improving the performance of the churn prediction model itself, such as simply comparing the performance of various models, exploring features that are effective in forecasting departures, or developing new ensemble techniques, and were limited in terms of practical utilization because most studies considered the entire customer group as a group and developed a predictive model. As such, the main purpose of the existing related research was to improve the performance of the predictive model itself, and there was a relatively lack of research to improve the overall customer churn prediction process. In fact, customers in the business have different behavior characteristics due to heterogeneous transaction patterns, and the resulting churn rate is different, so it is unreasonable to assume the entire customer as a single customer group. Therefore, it is desirable to segment customers according to customer classification criteria, such as loyalty, and to operate an appropriate churn prediction model individually, in order to carry out effective customer churn predictions in heterogeneous industries. Of course, in some studies, there are studies in which customers are subdivided using clustering techniques and applied a churn prediction model for individual customer groups. Although this process of predicting churn can produce better predictions than a single predict model for the entire customer population, there is still room for improvement in that clustering is a mechanical, exploratory grouping technique that calculates distances based on inputs and does not reflect the strategic intent of an entity such as loyalties.  This study proposes a segment-based customer departure prediction process (CCP/2DL: Customer Churn Prediction based on Two-Dimensional Loyalty segmentation) based on two-dimensional customer loyalty, assuming that successful customer churn management can be better done through improvements in the overall process than through the performance of the model itself. CCP/2DL is a series of churn prediction processes that segment two-way, quantitative and qualitative loyalty-based customer, conduct secondary grouping of customer segments according to churn patterns, and then independently apply heterogeneous churn prediction models for each churn pattern group. Performance comparisons were performed with the most commonly applied the General churn prediction process and the Clustering-based churn prediction process to assess the relative excellence of the proposed churn prediction process. The General churn prediction process used in this study refers to the process of predicting a single group of customers simply intended to be predic",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

It is notable that these films, Spike Jonze’s Her(2014), Denis Villeneuve’s Blade Runner 2049(2017), and Michael Almereyda’s Marjorie Prime(2017) describe artificial intelligence on a everyday and personal level, which was often somewhat exaggerated as a threat in the past science fiction films. Three films as SF genre were produced in the mid-2010s, and at the same time, the artificial intelligence is disembodied or virtual hologram. In addition, it is problematic in that these films set the artificial intelligence as the being who can coexist with human by learning and embodying love, emotional labor, and memory which are human’s own uniqueness. The argument related with aspects of the artificial intelligence as relational being is based on post-human discourse. In this respect, each film explores the possibility of love between humans and artificial intelligence, reveals artificial intelligence’s gendered emotional labor, and checks the possibility that human memory can be reconstructed by artificial intelligence. Through the representation of artificial intelligence, this paper points out that the artificial intelligence’s being and the relationship between human and the machine are linked to post-human thought.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

In this respect, this study examines the trends regarding the development of social value measurement methods, the methodological differences between agents, and the characteristics of the latest measurement methods.  The development process of social value measurement method began with agents such as governments, international organizations, and non-profit foundations. As various agents develop and implement their own measurement methods, the call for global standardization has increased. The agents can be primarily categorized into international organizations, governments, nonprofit entities, impact investment institutions, consulting firms, and corporate initiatives. The measurement methods differ from agent to agent as the objectives of each are different.  This study considers five characteristics regarding recent social value measurement. First, there is a gradual movement to translate social value in monetary terms to utilize both social and economic values in decision-making. Second, since the 2010s, the international community has emphasized the need for the establishment of global standards for social value measurement. Third, there has been a transition from supplier-oriented measurements to a system that measures the actual change for beneficiaries. Fourth, changes have been made to integrate both social and economic values in reporting rather than social value alone. Lastly, there have been an increase in attempts to collect information via artificial intelligence and machine learning for more accurate measurement.  This is the first research to organize various agents based on their social value measurement methods. It provides insight on the current direction and role of these methods through their characteristics.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

The classification accuracy of mobility mode is highly affected by the GPS sampling rate, which has a significant effect on the battery consumption of the device. Therefore, this paper presents a new method to extract mobility features from GPS trajectories for mobility mode classification, and analyze the effect of GPS sampling rate on the classification accuracy and battery consumption. Specifically, we propose features including Heading Change Rate (HCR), Stop Rate (SR), and Velocity Change Rate (VCR) based on moving duration, in addition to statistical features such as velocity, acceleration, and jerk measured from the GPS trajectories.The proposed method is compared with previous work using various machine learning algorithms, and the experiment results show that the proposed method shows 2.3%~3% higher accuracy with random forest classification. Also, the results demonstrate that setting the GPS sampling rate to 10 seconds reduces classification accuracy by 0.6% compared to the highest accuracy, but reduces battery consumption by 33%, minimizing battery consumption without loss of classification accuracy.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

It is necessary to introduce educational contents on this problem as an important theme in unification education in schools to deal with the issues of inter-Korean language integration. Differences in vocabulary, phonetics, and speech expressions have been mainly studied as obstacles to language adaptation experienced by North Korean refugees. These problems are difficult to resolve academic issues easily and are still hard tasks requiring long-term efforts. On the other hand, the integration of language norms is a relatively easy-to-access area of social rules, and at the same time, it is a very sensitive issue for North Korean refugees because it causes social stigma and psychological alienation.Using the case of spacing and notation of Saishiot(ㅅ) as the subject matter, the approach to language integration in unification education was reviewed. It was suggested to take care not to become an obstacle to the machine processing of Korean language information while taking complementary integration and emphasizing traditional old native vocabularies as a principle. This approach is easy to harmonize with the trend of unification education in the era of multi-culturalism aiming at promotion of social integration and inspiring self-esteem of all concerned. It will be a case where greater results can be expected when approaching cross-curricular learning under the title of unification education.

In order to secure the competitiveness of companies, it is necessary to improve decision-making capacity using a classification algorithm. However, most of them do not have sufficient knowledge on what kind of classification algorithm is appropriate for a specific problem area. In other words, determining which classification algorithm is appropriate depending on the characteristics of the dataset was has been a task that required expertise and effort. This is because the relationship between the characteristics of datasets (called meta-features) and the performance of classification algorithms has not been fully understood. Moreover, there has been little research on meta-features reflecting the characteristics of multi-class. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to empirically analyze whether meta-features of multi-class datasets have a significant effect on the performance of classification algorithms. In this study, meta-features of multi-class datasets were identified into two factors, (the data structure and the data complexity,) and seven representative meta-features were selected. Among those, we included the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), originally a market concentration measurement index, in the meta-features to replace IR(Imbalanced Ratio). Also, we developed a new index called Reverse ReLU Silhouette Score into the meta-feature set.  Among the UCI Machine Learning Repository data, six representative datasets (Balance Scale, PageBlocks, Car Evaluation, User Knowledge-Modeling, Wine Quality(red), Contraceptive Method Choice) were selected. The class of each dataset was classified by using the classification algorithms (KNN, Logistic Regression, Nave Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM) selected in the study. For each dataset, we applied 10-fold cross validation method. 10% to 100% oversampling method is applied for each fold and meta-features of the dataset is measured. The meta-features selected are HHI, Number of Classes, Number of Features, Entropy, Reverse ReLU Silhouette Score, Nonlinearity of Linear Classifier, Hub Score. F1-score was selected as the dependent variable. As a result, the results of this study showed that the six meta-features including Reverse ReLU Silhouette Score and HHI proposed in this study have a significant effect on the classification performance. (1) The meta-features HHI proposed in this study was significant in the classification performance. (2) The number of variables has a significant effect on the classification performance, unlike the number of classes, but it has a positive effect. (3) The number of classes has a negative effect on the performance of classification. (4) Entropy has a significant effect on the performance of classification. (5) The Reverse ReLU Silhouette Score also significantly affects the classification performance at a significant level of 0.01. (6) The nonlinearity of linear classifiers has a significant negative effect on classification performance. In addition, the results of the analysis by the classification algorithms were also consistent. In the regression analysis by classification algorithm, Naïve Bayes algorithm does not have a significant effect on the number of variables unlike other classification algorithms. This study has two theoretical contributions: (1) two new meta-features (HHI, Reverse ReLU Silhouette score) was proved to be significant. (2) The effects of data characteristics on the performance of classification were investigated using meta-features. The practical contribution points (1) can be utilized in the development of classification algorithm recommendation system according to the characteristics of datasets.

To supplement resource-intensive in vivo and in vitro studies required for cartilage tissue engineering, computational models and simulations can assist in enhancing experimental design.METHODS: Research articles pertinent to cartilage tissue engineering and computer modeling were identified, reviewed, and summarized. Various applications of computer modeling for cartilage tissue engineering are highlighted, limitations of in silico modeling are addressed, and suggestions for future work are enumerated.RESULTS: Computational modeling can help better characterize shear stresses generated by bioreactor fluid flow, refine scaffold geometry, customize the mechanical properties of engineered cartilage tissue, and model rates of cell growth and dynamics. Thus, results from in silico studies can help resourcefully enhance in vitro and in vivo studies; however, the limitations of these studies, such as the underlying assumptions and simplifications applied in each model, should always be addressed and justified where applicable. In silico models should also seek validation and verification when possible.CONCLUSION: Future studies may adopt similar approaches to supplement in vitro trials and further investigate effects of mechanical stimulation on chondrocyte and stem cell dynamics. Additionally, as precision medicine, machine learning, and powerful open-source software become more popular and accessible, applications of multi-scale and multiphysics computational models in cartilage tissue engineering are expected to increase.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv
Personalized Psychiatry and Depression: The Role of Sociodemographic and Clinical Variables,2020,"['Depression', 'Personalized medicine', 'Drug targeting', 'Clinical markers', 'Antidepressants', 'Treatment outcome.']",,"Despite several pharmacological options, the clinical outcomes of major depressive disorder (MDD) are often unsatisfactory. Personalized psychiatry attempts to tailor therapeutic interventions according to each patient’s unique profile and characteristics. This approach can be a crucial strategy in improving pharmacological outcomes in MDD and overcoming trial-and-error treatment choices. In this narrative review, we evaluate whether sociodemographic (i.e., gender, age, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status) and clinical [i.e., body mass index (BMI), severity of depressive symptoms, and symptom profiles] variables that are easily assessable in clinical practice may help clinicians to optimize the selection of antidepressant treatment for each patient with MDD at the early stages of the disorder.We found that several variables were associated with poorer outcomes for all antidepressants. However, only preliminary associations were found between some clinical variables (i.e., BMI, anhedonia, and MDD with melancholic/atypical features) and possible benefits with some specific antidepressants. Finally, in clinical practice, the assessment of sociodemographic and clinical variables considered in our review can be valuable for early identification of depressed individuals at high risk for poor responses to antidepressants, but there are not enough data on which to ground any reliable selection of specific antidepressant class or compounds. Recent advances in computational resources, such as machine learning techniques, which are able to integrate multiple potential predictors, such as individual/ clinical variables, biomarkers, and genetic factors, may offer future reliable tools to guide personalized antidepressant choice for each patient with MDD.",machine_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

The training data generally assumes that there are no errors, but in reality they include various types of errors, which cause performance degradation of systems trained using the data. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel method for detecting errors in the existing POS tagged corpus using the classifier of XGBoost and cross-validation as evaluation techniques. We first train a classifier of a POS tagger using the POS-tagged corpus with some errors and then detect errors from the POS-tagged corpus using cross-validation, but the classifier cannot detect errors because there is no training data for detecting POS tagged errors. We thus detect errors by comparing the outputs (probabilities of POS) of the classifier, adjusting hyperparameters. The hyperparameters is estimated by a small scale error-tagged corpus, in which text is sampled from a POS-tagged corpus and which is marked up POS errors by experts. In this paper, we use recall and precision as evaluation metrics which are widely used in information retrieval. We have shown that the proposed method is valid by comparing two distributions of the sample (the error-tagged corpus) and the population (the POS-tagged corpus) because all detected errors cannot be checked.

PGA: An Efficient Adaptive Traffic Signal Timing Optimization Scheme Using Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning Algorithm,2020,"['Traffic signal timing', 'reinforcement learning', 'actor-critic', 'proximal policy optimization', 'generalized advantage estimation']",,"Advanced traffic signal timing method plays very important role in reducing road congestion and air pollution. Reinforcement learning is considered as superior approach to build traffic light timing scheme by many recent studies. It fulfills real adaptive control by the means of taking real-time traffic information as state, and adjusting traffic light scheme as action. However, existing works behave inefficient in complex intersections and they are lack of feasibility because most of them adopt traffic light scheme whose phase sequence is flexible. To address these issues, a novel adaptive traffic signal timing scheme is proposed. It's based on actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm, and advanced techniques proximal policy optimization and generalized advantage estimation are integrated. In particular, a new kind of reward function and a simplified form of state representation are carefully defined, and they facilitate to improve the learning efficiency and reduce the computational complexity, respectively. Meanwhile, a fixed phase sequence signal scheme is derived, and constraint on the variations of successive phase durations is introduced, which enhances its feasibility and robustness in field applications. The proposed scheme is verified through field-data-based experiments in both medium and high traffic density scenarios.

Dynamic Action Space Handling Method for Reinforcement Learning Models,2020,"['Dance Tutorial System', 'Q-Learning', 'Reinforcement Learning', 'Virtual Tutor']",,"Recently, extensive studies have been conducted to apply deep learning to reinforcement learning to solve thestate-space problem. If the state-space problem was solved, reinforcement learning would become applicablein various fields. For example, users can utilize dance-tutorial systems to learn how to dance by watching andimitating a virtual instructor. The instructor can perform the optimal dance to the music, to which reinforcementlearning is applied. In this study, we propose a method of reinforcement learning in which the action space isdynamically adjusted. Because actions that are not performed or are unlikely to be optimal are not learned, andthe state space is not allocated, the learning time can be shortened, and the state space can be reduced. In anexperiment, the proposed method shows results similar to those of traditional Q-learning even when the statespace of the proposed method is reduced to approximately 0.33% of that of Q-learning. Consequently, theproposed method reduces the cost and time required for learning. Traditional Q-learning requires 6 million statespaces for learning 100,000 times. In contrast, the proposed method requires only 20,000 state spaces.

The first part of this study answers three questions: ""what is vicarious reinforcement?"" ""how does vicarious reinforcement take place in observational learning?"" and ""how does vicarious reinforcement affect observer's behavior change?"" Bandura conceptualizes the learning process with observational learning and imitative or non-imitative performance. Based on this concept, Bandura define the roles of vicarious reinforcement in the four steps of observational learning process: attention, retention, motor reproduction, and motivational process. Also, the three effects of vicarious reinforcements are explained in the following categories: the observational learning effect, inhibitory or disinhibitory effects, and eliciting effect. Adapting the structure of observational learning theory in terms of the effect of vicarious reinforcement and the function of role models, the second part of this study examines the biblical concept of imitation of Christ and the modeling strategy of discipleship. Especially Paul's spiritual role model serves as positive vicarious reinforcement for the Christian believers to perform the desired behaviors. Also, Paul's condemnation serves as explicit negative vicarious reinforcement. Then, the last part of this study covers the implication of these findings from observational learning and empirical studies in terms of spiritual role modeling to Christian education.",reinforcement_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

First, a decision from a centralized knowledge base isunsuitable because of the communication and power constraintsin FANET. Second, the high mobility and the low density of theUAVs in FANET require constant adaptation to newly exploredspatial environments containing unbalanced data; rendering a distributed jamming detection mechanism inadequate. Third, takingmodel-based jamming defense actions in a newly explored environment, without a precise estimation of the transitional probabilities,is challenging.

This avoids several difficulties namely in system identification, accurate modeling, and runtime complexity, that arise when dealing with processes subject to nonlinear dynamics and stochastic influences. Instead of using the pre-created process and observation models, value-function-based reinforcement learning algorithms build functions of expected future reward, which are used to derive optimal process control decisions. The expectation functions are learned online, by interacting with the process. The proposed algorithm takes stochastic variations of the process conditions into account and is able to cope with partial observability.

Since the behavior of wireless channels, and the received reward in each state associated with the system, is stochastic in nature, the dynamic property of the environment allows us to apply an actor-critic RL technique to learn the best policy through continuous interaction with the surroundings. The policy-based approach is better than a value-based scheme, such as Qlearning, because it takes the help of policy space in order to maximize the expected throughput. The actor adopts a parameter-based stochastic policy for continuous actions, while the critic evaluates the policy through its overall performance, and criticizes the actor for the policy it follows.

However, as the educational environment is rapidly changing due to the 4th Industrial Revolution and Covid19 Pandemic, various teaching methods are being developed accordingly, across all disciplines. Now, art education will also need to devise new teaching methods that can overcome the limitations of the existing teaching methods. This study aims to examine the learning effectiveness and educational meaning of the directing practicum class, which is applied with the new teaching method, by designing and operating the online teaching method in the directing practicum class, which had been conducted offline in the theater department.In previous directing classes, the project-based learning method had been applied and got many positive responses from students, but 3-hour session was too short to make the students' satisfaction level to reach its peak. To compensate the lack of time, the flip-learning was incorporated in designing this new teaching method and on-line materials were given to students before each class.As for research method, first, on- and off-line methods were combined, second, the weekly class plans were designed accordingly, and then each class was operated and evaluated to find out how students' satisfaction progressed. The new teaching method is named “Project-based flip-learning”, which examines both purpose and principle of project-based learning method and flip-learning. Each week, a newly derived project-based flip-learning was applied in the directing practicum class. Thus, the results of the application of the new teaching method were analyzed by the researchers' self-assessment and the survey of the learners' satisfaction in education to analyze the learning effects and educational implications of art practice classes.Through research result, self-assessment, and class satisfaction survey, it showed generally positive effects such as the active and self-led transformation of learners' attitude, the facilitation of students' interaction, and the improvement of learning effectiveness. On the other hand, the inconvenience of having to learn in advance through online video lectures was negative. Consequently, the design and operation of the classes by applying project-based flip-runs to the directing practicum class was deemed to require further expansion of the application of these teaching methods as the educational effects improve, although there are inconveniences in online classes.",reinforcement_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

The findings of the study are as follows.Firstly, the introduction of the high school credit system is not a policy that changes the standards of academic achievement or graduation accreditation from a grade level system or a unit system to a credit system, but a policy that is related to the right to learn that enables students to choose subjects considering their aptitudes and career pathways and to receive a high-quality education that meets the achievement standards of each subject. Thus, it is necessary to guarantee a student’s right to select subjects by offering various music curricular courses in order to realize the high school credit system in the music department. In addition, teaching and learning should take place in consideration of an individual student’s growth based on achievement standards, and high-quality subject learning should be realized through process-oriented evaluation.Secondly, the action plans of Korean music education for the high school credit system include a measure of expanding a right to select the subject of Korean music and cases for realizing process-oriented evaluation for each teacher. It is expected that Korean music courses will be more offered in many high schools by offering Korean music in various ways and showing examples of providing students with opportunities to complete the courses.This study is the first step for such changes.

In particular, it is not easy to detect when a worker falls down, making it difficult to respond quickly. Thus, research is being conducted to detect fallen workers using a camera or by attaching a device to the body. Existing image-based fall detection systems have been designed to detect a person's body parts; hence, it is difficult to detect them in various ships and postures. In this study, the entire fall area was extracted and deep learning was used to detect the fallen shipworker based on the image. The data necessary for learning were obtained by recording falling states at the shipyard. The amount of learning data was augmented by flipping, resizing, and rotating the image. Performance evaluation was conducted with precision, reproducibility, accuracy, and a low error rate. The larger the amount of data, the better the precision. In the future, reinforcing various data is expected to improve the effectiveness of camera-based fall detection models, and thus improve safety.",reinforcement_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Furthermore, this study elucidated the mediating effect of learner satisfaction. The following results were derived. Firstly, the higher the education service quality was perceived, the higher the learning transfer appeared. Therefore, in terms of educational service perspective, the educational institutions are required not only to provide students with various services appropriate to the purposes of vocational training institutes such as information offering for occupations, opportunities for employment and career counseling but also to reinforce personal social services including improvement of the administration services or kindness of school personnel. Secondly, it was revealed that learner satisfaction completely mediates the association between education service quality and learning transfer.

First, an examination of the reflection sheets of learners in a Japanese class revealed that the components of learner autonomy, such as “motivation or affective factors,” “metacognition factors,” and “learning strategy factors.” This indicates the possibility that reflection activities using sheets implicitly promoted the learner to elicit the above factors. Secondly, through metareflection as an explicit action that can be associated with autonomous learning, whether reflection activities helped to enhance learner autonomy, and, if so, what is the reason, was examined. The result reveals that most learners perceived positively; further, it was possible to confirm the possibility that metacognition which was specifically mentioned, was activated to reinforce the awareness of autonomous learning. Finally, to determine if consciousnessraising in reflection activities affects behavior, such as the use of learning strategies. A selfregulated learning strategy scale survey was conducted, which consisted of five factors: a) “reflecting on learning”; b) “devising learning”; c) “asking peers”; d) “developing a learning plan”; and e) “rewarding oneself.” As a result, the use of learning strategies before and after reflection activities and their changes were identified, with results that suggested a positive effect.

Twenty five elementary school students in grades 1-5 in Seoul currently learning violin were selected as participants. They were asked to watch the video of the violin education content “Violin Structure and Name” available on the YouTube channel. The students were subsequently interviewed and opinions were exchanged, while taking all necessary precautions amid the rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 patients. The study concludes the following. First, students believe that YouTube enables learning through free viewing, and that it is easy to communicate and share views with other violin learners. In addition, it was revealed that the effect of learning can be enhanced by allowing infinite viewing through repeated playback of YouTube videos. Second, regarding the merits of the “violin structure and name” subject video, online learning can substitute offline classes amid the unprecedented situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Online learning enables effective learning, saves time, and it is possible to respond to queries through comments. Third, as to the disadvantages of the subject video, it is necessary to create a video that considers students’ perspectives and targets the desired audience. In particular, in the case of videos targeting elementary school students, it was suggested to include elements that would be liked by elementary school students to increase their concentration and to reduce eye strain by making short videos. Lastly, comment management is important to prevent emotional stress because of unnecessary comments on the video. Thus, it is necessary to reinforce strategies to promote awareness and competitiveness through the growth and management of contents along with the production of videos on various topics related to violin learning.",reinforcement_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

The process was applied to operational works of NPPs.Results: Case studies for applying the process showed that it could effectively identify good practices and that it had a potential to reinforce safety culture through the process implementation as well as the identified good practices. Good practices from successful work cases were evaluated to be worthy of workers"" learning since there would be no chances to derive them from failure cases.Conclusion: Applying the process for identifying and sharing good practices for safety culture will contribute to the internalization of safety culture in the field workers in NPPs and help the organization find valuable insights to improve safety culture in the reality of operational works. If efforts are continued to learn from successes, interests in safety culture will be maintained and ultimately nuclear safety will be ensured.Application: The process to identify good practices can be applied not only to NPPs but also to other safety fields such as the radiation use and aviation industry.",reinforcement_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

And to discuss how useful narratives work in education. The narrative experience is accompanied by reflective and critical thinking. Considering the interaction between narrative and human development, we can understand the narrative involved in education. The way of narrative is a metaphor for the way of existence of education. The narrative itself has a prototype of education. The old narrative gives us the validity of educational wisdom that is not easily broken down. Narratives exist as a form of learning. The wholeness of the narrative is not easily dissected. The way of narrative is closely related to the way of experience. Therefore, it responds well to the convergence education needed in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Storytelling shows the dynamic of narrative. As the media diversify, storytelling has a variety of communication effects. Thus, narratives that were recognized as content or structure centered are now recognized as working in a variety of ways. Narratives reinforce learners motivations in a variety of ways and help them to think more dynamically. Narrative is rich in context. The educational practice of narrative can be embodied by transferring storytelling to learning activities. Narrative and storytelling should be identified as an organic connection, and the cultural functions and educational actions of storytelling should be implemented on-site.

First of all, the pattern was drawn for a child with harm avoidance to be vulnerable to develop anxiety. It is explained that when a child with harm avoidance was placed in a lack of support, the child became vulnerable to develop anxiety because of negative memories related to threat stimuli-respond and automatic avoidance. Next, the study examined how animal assisted play therapy influences for a child with harm avoidance to accumulate positive memories and control automatic avoidance through the case study method. As a result, experiential processes were derived from the analysis of dynamics between a child and a therapy dog; ‘the process of automatic avoidance and new experiential learning’ and ‘the process of reinforcing positive memories and controling avoidance’.

The miscue analysis followed the RMI (Reading Miscue Inventory) procedure initiated by Goodman (2005). The results are as follows. First, the number of the errors of the lower group was less than that of the middle group, suggesting that the lower group needs to be encouraged to have a risk-taking attitude and provided with an encouraging feedback. Second, for the middle and the lower group, there occurred various error types, which cause difficulty with their understanding of the text. This indicates the need to provide level-specific English reading instructions based on learners’ reading strategies and characteristics. Third, all three groups have the same high ratio of the errors related to phonetic cues, indicating that they rely heavily on phonetic cues and that learning English sounds and letters, which is not currently specified in the middle school English curriculum, still needs to be reinforced.",reinforcement_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

The transmissive lecture could be effective in conveying much information to large group learners in a relatively short period of time. However, the one-way transmissive religious education of Christian university separates between: learner-text; learner-learner; learner-teacher, and further weakens Christian identity. In that sense, we need to investigate the possibility of utilizing relationship-oriented havruta as an alternative to overcome the limitation of transmissive religious educational paradigm in Christian university. Havruta is a tool to convey Jewish beliefs and traditions and strengthen Jewish identity. At the same time, havruta is a relationship-based educational method. From a relational perspective, havruta is performed only in relationship. Focusing on the relationships between: learner-text; learner-learner; learner-teacher, one practices havruta with a sense of responsibility in part for each other’s learning. In this article, I intend to explore havruta, which pursues relationship as an alternative to overcome the one-way lecture-style religious education of Christian university as follows. First, I examine the situation of segregation of learner-text, learner-learner, and learner-teacher relationship, which is the problem of religious education in Christian university. Second, I scrutinize the main concepts of havruta by focusing on the definition, principles, and stages, Korean educational model of havruta from a relational point of view. Third, I investigate the possibility of applying havruta in religious education to form and reinforce diverse relationships through the case of B religious education at A Christian University. Finally, I conclude by presenting how Christian university should move forward in religious education through havruta. Therefore, in the mutual cooperative relationships among text, learner, and teacher, we expect havruta to surmount the paradigm of transmissive religious education in Christian university and to further strengthen the identity of Christian university.",reinforcement_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

The human’s action is recognized in order to balance the table by the proposed robot whose camera takes the image of the table’s state, and it performs the table-balancing action according to the recognized human action without high performance equipment. The classification of human action uses a deep learning technology, specifically AlexNet, and has an accuracy of 96.9% over 10-fold cross-validation. The experiment of Q-learning was carried out over 2,000 episodes with 200 trials. The overall results of the proposed Q-learning show that the Q function stably converged at this number of episodes.

Notch filters are highly effective for suppressing resonances in motion control systems and are widely utilized in industry. However, severe limitations exist in complex servo systems because there are many vibration modes that are difficult to identify. In such cases, several notch filters must be used, but the task of tuning these filters involves lengthy empirical procedures by well-experienced engineers. To automate this tuning process, this paper proposes a novel design method that can design several notch filters simultaneously for the first time. In this method, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm with a vector stability margin as the reward function is utilized to find filter parameters in the frequency domain. The proposed method simultaneously finds a set of many parameters for several notch filters that are optimal with respect to stability. Using a real industrial servo system that has multiple resonances, it is demonstrated that the proposed method effectively finds the optimal parameters for several notch filters and successfully suppresses multiple resonances to provide desired performances.",reinforcement_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

This paper presents an experimental robustness study on a kind data-driven optimal control approach based on an underactuated rotary flexible joint system. The data-driven approach combines the off-policy optimal control algorithm and the popular integral reinforcement learning technique. Through literature review, we find that the key step of the control design lies in that it learns the optimal value function and control policy simultaneously from the input and output (I/O) data. However, the I/O data are often disturbed by the system uncertainty or environmental noise, and then it will indirectly affect the optimal control performance. To investigate the robustness of the data-driven optimal control approach, we artificially set different experimental scenarios and take numerous control experiments on a RFJ experimental setup. The experimental results show that the data-driven optimal control method is quite robust against the system uncertainties in terms of maintaining the stability and delivering satisfactory tracking performance, even when the uncertainty is not a small quantity. In addition, the disturbance originating from environmental noise has certain impact on the controlling of RFJ system, but as long as the noise power is not too large, the control algorithm can converge to a satisfactory result. Finally, we find that the probing signal up has strong influence to this control algorithm, which reminds us to be cautious when selecting the probing signal.",reinforcement_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Automatic Gain Tuning Method of a Quad-Rotor Geometric Attitude Controller Using A3C,2020,['Quad-rotor · Geometric control · Adaptive control · Reinforcement learning · A3C'],,"In this paper, we address an automated gain tuning method using Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) reinforcement learning approach. A quad-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with nonlinear geometric tracking controller is introduced to test our approach. In the geometric controller, two attitude gains must be provided appropriately to achieve stable error dynamics. To ease the difficulties while optimizing the controller performances, such as minimizing tracking error together with reducing control energy, we made Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents to substitute the entire gain tuning process. By training the RL agents with multiple quad-rotor configurations, we were not only able to reduce our efforts putting into the gain tuning by the trial-and-error methods, but also able to deal with the parameter changes by constructing an adaptive structure.",reinforcement_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Grammatical Error Correction Models for Korean Language via Pre-trained Denoising,2020,"['Natural language processing', 'Grammatical error correction', 'Denoising auto-encoder', 'Transfer learning', 'Parallel corpus']",,"Since the era of burgeoning big data, text data have not only become increasingly accessible but also been widely applied to diverse domains. In these circumstances, adequate language processing is urgently required to handle the enormous amount of unorganized data (e.g., wrong, missing, incomplete). To deal with text data errors, varied efforts have been applied to develop grammatical error correction (GEC) models, especially for the English language. However, correction models for Korean have remained relatively unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel GEC model specialized in Korean. Owing to the lack of training sample-label pairs (parallel corpus) in the pre-training phase, prior to training in the main stage, this model accommodates a pre-defined noise function that produces artificial errors to reinforce the previous language-correction models. For numerical study, we generate approximately 37 million training sentences and choose the case study of Korean learners’ parallel corpus, a benchmark dataset for text correction. We conclude from the study that the proposed model outperforms humans in the context of bilingual evaluation understudy scores.",reinforcement_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

However, existing damage localization methods cannot be used for localizing the damage of bridges in real time because of their slow testing speed. Thus, in this study a damage localization approach was developed using a convolutional neural network (CNN). To develop the CNN model for damage localization, simulation data was generated through a numerical model of a reinforced concrete Rahmen bridge with static loading conditions. The proposed CNN-based approach aims to identify 12 single damage locations or no damage. The approach was trained and tested with three different data set generated with three damage severities, and it was possible to estimate the damage location with an accuracy of 87.3% when the damage severity in the bridge is serious.

Here, we examined a transgenic mouse line (G2CT) in which synaptic transmissions onto the medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the basal ganglia are depressed. We found that the level of collaterals from direct pathway MSNs in the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe) ('bridging collaterals') was decreased in these mice, and this was accompanied by behavioral inhibition under stress. Furthermore, additional manipulations that could further decrease or restore the level of the bridging collaterals resulted in an increase in behavioral inhibition or active behavior in the G2CT mice, respectively.

University students’ ability to identify and apply leisure concepts in an EMI class in South Korea: Analyzing writings about the movie A River Runs through It,2020,"['EMI', 'Leisure studies', 'Recreation', 'University students', 'South Korea', 'Content analysis']",,"As developed countries age, there are fewer students to matriculate to college campuses. One way of filling seats is by recruiting international students. These students can be economically beneficial as they often pay higher tuition costs and contribute to local economies through living expenses (OECD, 2020). A growing trend making non-Anglophone countries attractive to these students is English as a method of instruction (EMI) classes. EMI courses teach subject matter in classes such as business, tourism, and international relations in English, even though it may not be the native language of any of the students in the classroom. In order to provide satisfactory learning environments for these students, it is necessary to utilize varied and contemporary teaching methods. One such method is the incorporation of movies in order to illustrate key topics and aid in retention. This exploratory paper analyzes Korean and international student reaction papers in an EMI Introduction to Leisure class at “K” University in South Korea to investigate students’ understanding of the lecture material and how they apply their knowledge to scenes from the film A River Runs through It.

Investigating Test Practices and Washback Effects: Voices from Primary School English Teachers in Hong Kong,2020,"['washback effect', 'school-based exam', 'primary English education']",,"Despite the significant role of teachers in assessment (Kim & Jang, 2019), their voice has been neglected in washback literature. In Hong Kong, curriculum and examination are ever-changing in order to provide better education for learners. Since 2004, a Territory-wide System Assessment (TSA) has been implemented into the school curriculum. Teachers have been seen as the major agents to foster positive washback effects. However, little research has been conducted on the washback effects of TSA at the primary school level and teachers’ voices have been overlooked. To fill this gap, this study explores teachers’ perceptions and behavioural changes under the context of the school-based examination change. It also investigates the phenomenon of the washback effect in light of school policy, English curriculum development, and school-based exams in a Hong Kong local primary school. A semi-structured interview has been conducted in a local primary school with three English teachers instructing elite, normal and small classes in the same level. Around ten questions were asked about examination changes and teachers’ workload. The interviews were recorded and later been transcribed for data analysis.

In order to investigate the perception of the members, I visited the unit school and interviewed the physical education teachers. The interview was conducted for five month in June 2019, and an in-depth interview was conducted with a total of six people. The main issues of regular teachers and school officials derived through in-depth interviews were job security and treatment of instructor occupations. Assessing the ability and quality of instructors to teach students, budgeting for school sports clubs at government level for effective sports club activities, It was suggested to establish various systems for the activation of school sports club activities, such as reflection on career and college entrance.  First, there are major revisions to administrative and policy reinforcement, such as securing the budget, This is a reality where the budget for sports instructors is very low and the population of sports instructors must be increased for better teaching quality. In addition, sports instructors are new jobs created by job creation and are hired as contract workers, which puts them in jeopardy every year. In this situation, sports instructors increase job insecurity and job insecurity, which can affect job satisfaction and quality of instruction. Therefore, a rational improvement plan such as employment stability through the contract of arms and the transition to public service is needed.  Second, institutional support measures include reflecting the career and academic system of sports club activities, and expanding the facilities such as classrooms, equipment, and tools. There are still many students and parents who feel that the major subjects in Korea, English, and Sue are important, and that sports activities are a waste of time. In addition, sports club activities are receiving more enthusiasm because they have no experience in school records. For this reason, awards and participation events through sports club activities should remain in the history and be reflected in the career and college system, and should be introduced in the university entrance system. In addition, school sports activities are conducted at the same time and in the same place as other sports, which affects the class a lot. In addition, as the number of students per sports instructor is large, there is a lack of equipment and class tools necessary for the class, so some students are waiting and some students are participating. Therefore, the expansion of facilities, such as separate places and lacking teaching equipment and tools, should be improved for each event.  Third, there are ways to improve the instructor""s work, such as their own teaching methods, curriculum planning, and reinforcement of their leadership capacity through training activities. Sports instructors are expected to teach various sports and develop sports club activities so that students can participate with interest. To do this, you need to create your own teaching methods and course plans so that students can experience a variety of sports activities. In addition, various trainings are underway to revitalize school sports and strengthen leadership skills. Through these trainings, students will have to learn their teaching techniques and instructional know-how to strengthen their competences and make quality lessons.",reinforcement_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

The results of a survey of students enrolled in the five major universities of science and technology in Korea show that freshmen evaluated the educational effects of online classes lower than senior students, and most freshmen took online classes in an isolated environment. As a result, freshmen suffered from more difficulties such as having no friends to give and receive help with assignments, and network connection problems. In terms of opportunities to solve questions, concentration on the class, and motivation for learning, freshmen showed lower evaluation than senior students. In the case of real-time online classes, freshmen showed a higher desire for communication and interaction, but the actual class management did not satisfy this desire, leading to their lower concentration on the class. Regarding recorded lectures, freshmen gave lower evaluations in the quality and quantity of recorded lectures, opportunities to solve questions, the possibility of easy preparation and review, and class concentration. As a result, freshmen were less likely to recommend online classes and less willing to take them. It was also revealed that in daily life during the online semester, freshmen were relatively inexperienced in terms of self-management and productive use of time. These findings suggest that designing classes in a way that is active in communication and interaction, and reinforcing the socialization and social capital cultivation functions of schools are essential to not only improve online lectures but also persuade the significance of going to school.",reinforcement_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Data analyses showed that there was statistically significant difference between the total numbers of the errors from the pretest and the posttest. Furthermore, all the error types present in Korean adults’ essays witnessed a reduction after fourteen weeks of self-correction. In addition, it should be worth the effort to note that the most frequent error type, Awkward expression accounted for more than half of a total number of errors. Unlike the positive role of self-correction on writing, there was no significant effect of self-correction on syntactic complexity. As a result, error analysis needs to be practiced in the classroom for comprehending error types which students make and designing teaching materials for strategies of having their pupils reduce errors in writing. Furthermore, it is highly recommended that learning and teaching of sentence-level writing along with grammar be reinforced in the classroom since without these students are prone to failing to improve the quality of their English writing.",reinforcement_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

In order to resolve the issue related to this Critical Literacy, this study suggests a lecture plan, which uses ‘Hallyu’ that is familiar to foreign students and arouses a strong desire for learning, for ‘reading’ and Hallyu-related newspaper articles ‘as reading materials’. This time, ‘CDA’ is applied as ‘a way of reading’ and in the light of characteristics of academic task combining reading and writing together, a ‘lecture’ is designed to integrate ‘reading and writing’, like ‘writing after reading newspaper articles’ and ‘writing after reading announcements’. Moreover, this study illustrates the contents of the fifth week lecture and the session 1 instruction by example and defines an educational implication of this lecture.

In the review, the main targets were the testimony of the victims of the atomic bomb, and the memorial ceremony of the atomic bomb week. Through the review, this article explained that the identity of victims in Japan is formed by sharing the emotion of pain  and emotional language of pain of the victims of the atomic bomb. That process was a reminder of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the past, and at the same time forgetting the fact of Japan's war responsibility and the assaults of colonial rule. The Japanese identity of the victims showed a duality that enables a solidarity of transnational  peace based on the sociality of pain and moral sentiment, along with the oblivion of responsibility of war. However, more than 70 years after the war, the emotion of pain inscribed on the body due to the aging and death of the atomic bomb victims gradually disappeared, and as the postwar generation who had no experience of war became the mainstream of society, the moral sentiment declined. The transnational solidarity of the peace was weakened. Amidst the social unrest caused by the collapse of the Cold War and the bubble economy, Japanese society has entered the era of memory from the experience of the atomic bombing, and the task of how the generation without experience will inherit the memory of the atomic bombing has emerged.

Based on the results of the 2015-2018 National Assessment of Educational Achievement (NAEA), we analyzed middle school students’ mastery of 84 curriculum achievement standards. In the analysis, we used representative item information by achievement level and correct answer rate and checked the validity of the determination of mastery. According to the results of the analysis, 15 of the 84 achievement standards could not determine the degree of achievement.In science, many achievement standards could be mastered only by above-average group students. By achievement level, there were six achievement standards that advanced achievement-level students did not achieve, 38 achievement standards judged to represent mastery by advanced achievement-level students, 23 achievement standards judged to represent mastery by proficient achievement-level students, and two achievement standards judged to represent mastery by basic achievement-level students. By content area, the number of achievement standards corresponding to advanced and proficient levels was similar in the areas of motion and energy and earth and space domains. In the material and life domains, there were more achievement standards corresponding to advanced levels. Accordingly, it is necessary to reinforce customized teaching and learning activities in relation to achievement standards that were under-achieved.",reinforcement_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

VIII and IX, Aristotle discusses various kinds of cognitive behavior of animals, such as survival tactics, rearing of the young, learning, and communication. Among them, there are also animal behaviors that are referred to as phronima, i.e. as behaviors based on phronēsis. However, a deeper understanding of these animal cognitive behaviors involves a more complex issue. This is  because, as Aristotle famously stated in the EN, phronēsis is an acquired ability to deliberate well, and no other animals except humans are capable of deliberation. So, what does it mean when Aristotle attributes phronima to nonhuman animals that cannot deliberate and choose? This article attempts to answer this question, by examining some relevant statements in Hist. an. I X and other works of A ristotle. My discussion consists of three phases. First, I identify the passages in the Hist. an., which deals with the animal phronima, and analyze the specific types of animals and their behavioral patterns Aristotle recognizes as phronēsis (Section 2). Then, after confirming that the phronēsis of animals is divided into the two types, ‘innate’ and ‘acquired’, I detail the limitations of animal phronēsis in comparison to human phronēsis (Section 3). Finally, by analyzing in detail the phronima of deer presented in Hist. an. IX, 5, I demonstrate the nature of the cognitive explanations regarding animal phronēsis Aristotle offers (Section 4). Based on these analyses, I conclude that the phronēsis of nonhuman animals has little to do with deliberation; rather, it stems from the innate power of foresight, which can be reinforced through memory or experience.",reinforcement_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

For this analysis, the investigator selected and analyzed a total of 24 representative humanities programs on TV according to the ten types and sampled 15 professionals in related areas (broadcasting producers, humanities scholars, lifelong education scholars, publication and media planners, and critics), and 38 citizen viewers according to the criterion-based selection, and conducted an in-depth interview with them. The findings show that the major characteristics of humanities programs on TV included succinct summaries and answers, lectures based on showing and performance, knowledge with bleached questions and critical perspectives, pursuit of broad and shallow knowledge, and a smooth introduction, development, turn, and conclusion. They were converted into some sort of sign values in humanities and supplied to viewers. Humanistic thinking is to share coded knowledge in the popular forms of summaries, commentaries, and explanations. They represented images coded socially and culturally, including the basis of creativity required from modern society, meanings as cultural assets to create a competitive edge, images of culture to symbolize an affluent and leisurely life, foundation of knowledge to acquire with a deficiency of capabilities, and images of information to be acquired easily and rapidly and consumed quickly. The patterns of their popular acceptance include easy and proper instant consumption; rest with humanities without purpose, a means to fulfill intellectual vanity, and consumption of celebrities  brand value, which were in common use as certain semantic systems. In this context, the consumption of humanities tended not to go further than the dimension of intellectual accessories, such as intellectual satisfaction and rest, healing, and tools of self-development. They seem to select what they will consume independently, but the truth is that they seek after hierarchical codes of the same sign systems and values around the objects of consumption. As a consequence, their isolation gets reinforced even more.

The program allows youth to share in historical and cultural experiences by listening to the elderly generation’s oral life stories. Moreover, this program is intended to improve communication and restore the relationship between the two generations through the emotional resonance of the lonely elderly and the youth indifferent to the world around them.The program requires the youth to produce a book after listening, recording, and organizing the elderly’s life stories. The activities consist of four stages: preparation, investigation, organization, and book making. The entire program is led by youth participants.In the first stage, the youth participants learn about the basics of oral life stories, investigation methods, questioning techniques, and dealing with recording equipment.The second, investigation stage, is divided into three phases: preliminary investigation, main investigation, and supplementary investigation. The preliminary investigation is where the first meeting of the elderly informants and the youth participants occurs. The main investigation centers on the informants, with them telling their life stories. The youth participants meticulously and vividly record this oral content. Supplementary investigation is the reinforcement of the oral life stories through photos.Stage 3 of the organization involves the youth participants recording the oral contents in accordance with the copy manual, having it inspected, and revising and supplementing it.Stage 4 is the book making part, formed to ensure that youth participants can experience the entire process of book publishing. The youth participants produce a manuscript of the main text using copied data in the organization stage, and they perform activities such as writing an introduction about the informants, drawing illustrations, making a title page, and participants’ caricature, and giving a review of the activity.As a result of the program, participants were able to achieve the desired emotional, social, and educational goals. Regarding the emotional aspect, the youth achieved active emotional connections and communication with the elderly, which led to their interest in the village community. The elderly generation evaluated that they gained vitality in their lives through communication with the youth, and their self-esteem also improved. From a social perspective, it improved the youths’ prejudices and perceptions about the elderly generation. In terms of education, not only were the youth able to acquire factual history, but they also acquired personality education that internalizes the wisdom of life conveyed by previous generations that cannot be learned in books, and vocational education related to archivists, publishing, and media.The limitation of the program is thst no continuous follow-up activities were conducted after the end of the program. It is worth considering follow-up activities for better communication between generations.",reinforcement_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

In this study, we analyzed the vegetation carbon stock and regeneration of community-managed pine plantation of Kathmandu, central Nepal. Vegetation data were collected from 40 circular plots of 10 m radius (for the tree) and 1m radius (for seedling) applying a stratified random sampling and nested quadrat method. The carbon stock was estimated by Chave allometric model and estimated carbon stock was converted into CO2 equivalents. Density-diameter (d-d) curve was also prepared to check the regeneration status and stability of the plantation. A d-d curve indicates the good regeneration status of the forest with a stable population in each size class. Diversity of trees was very low, only two tree species Pinus roxburghii and Eucalyptus citriodora occurred in the sample plots. Pine was the dominant tree in terms of density, basal area, biomass, carbon stock and CO2 stock than the eucalyptus. The basal area, carbon stock and CO2 stock of forest was 33±1.0 m2 ha-1, 108±5.0 Mg ha-1 and 394±18 Mg ha-1, respectively. Seedling and tree density of the plantation was 4,965 ha-1 and 339 ha-1 respectively. The forest carbon stock showed a positive relationship with biomass, tree diameter, height and basal area but no relationship with tree density. Canopy cover and tree diameter have a negative effect on seedling density and regeneration. In conclusion, the community forest has a stable population in each size class, sequestering a significant amount of carbon and CO2 emitted from densely populated Kathmandu metro city as the forest biomass hence have a potentiality to mitigate the global climate change.",random_forest_2020_academic_riss.csv

This study was carried out to determine key statistical characteristics of rainfall affecting the occurrences of flooding by using observed rainfall, one- and two-dimensional hydraulic analysis models, and random forests. The target area selected was the Centum City area of Busan, where flooding occurs frequently with heavy rainfall. For analysis, the rainfall data from the Automatic Weather System (AWS) and radar observatory in the entire city of Busan were collected. Using the results from the one- and two-dimensional numerical models, the occurrence of flooding was determined according to the observed rainfall events. The random forest was used to classify the presence or absence of flooding according to the statistical characteristics of rainfall, and the importance evaluation function was applied to determine the impact of each statistical factor. The three main statistical factors of rainfall with the greatest impact on the occurrence of flooding were analyzed as the 1-hr maximum rainfall, the average rainfall, and the skewness. On the other hand, the three main factors affecting the maximum flood depth were the 3-hrs maximum rainfall, the 1-hr maximum rainfall, and the total rainfall. It is judged that the results of this study will be useful in suggesting quantitative urban flood forecasting standards when rainfall is examined in real-time by using various observation equipment.",random_forest_2020_academic_riss.csv

In order to estimate the non-use value of the heterogeneous green space of Seoul—namely, the Han River, the urban forest, and Bukhansan Mountain—we acquired the actual transaction price for apartments—the main housing type in Seoul—and conducted a hedonic price analysis. Due to the nature of collective buildings, there were a number of transaction records with the same location information and the same housing characteristics. This resulted in a spatial autocorrelation in the transaction price and a hierarchical structure in the explanatory variables. To manage them, spatial lag variables, data grouping by the same housing characteristics, and the application of the hierarchical linear model were considered. Among these models, the spatial autocorrelation in the regression residuals decreased significantly when a two-level random intercept linear model was applied to the grouped transaction data. In case of estimation of the hedonic housing price model using the transaction data of collective housing in Korea, the method presented above is might be worth considering as an alternative if spatial econometric models cannot be directly applicable due to the large number of transactions.

The occurrence of M. capillaris was positively associated with the precipitation of the driest quarter. The projection map showed that suitable areas for M. capillaris are mainly concentrated in the southern coastal regions of South Korea, where temperatures and precipitation are higher than in other regions, especially in the winter season. We can conclude that M. capillaris is not considered to be invasive based on a habitat suitability map.

Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and random forests (RFs). Case herds were larger in size than control herds. Case herds had more animal movements and non-staff movements onto the site. Also, case herds had higher quantities of pigs delivered, feed deliveries and semen deliveries on-site. The biosecurity practices of case herds were considered more rigorous based on herd management, feed deliveries, transportation and truck driver practices than control herds.

Autoregressive Model-Based Structural Damage Identification and Localization Using Convolutional Neural Networks,2020,"['Autoregressive model', 'Time series', 'Convolutional neural network', 'Damage identification', 'Damage localization']",,"Traditional autoregressive (AR) model-based damage identification methods construct structural damage sensitive features by trial and error, which are time-consuming, laborious and may lead to poor recognition effect. This study applies convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to quickly and automatically extract high-dimensional features of autoregressive model coefficients (ARMCs). In this research, AR model was utilized to fit the acceleration time series. The input matrices marked with damage location were produced by ARMCs, and then those matrices were sent to the proposed CNN for training. The trained CNN was employed for damage identification and localization. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by the damage identification and localization of a three-storied frame structure. The performance of the proposed CNN was compared with multilayer perception (MLP), random forest, and support vector machine (SVM). Meanwhile, the prediction results from different sample types were also discussed. Furthermore, parametric study in relation to the number of accelerometers and ARMCs used is conducted. These analyses demonstrate that the accuracy of CNN tests results reach 100%, 6.67%, 20%, and 25% higher than that of MLP, random forest, and SVM, respectively. Besides, other metrics calculated in this paper (e.g., precision, recall) further indicate that the proposed CNN performs well. The combination of AR and CNN does show excellent performance in damage identification and localization, which seems to be able to resist external excitation changes and accurately identify the multi-location damage and minor damage using limited accelerometers and ARMCs.",random_forest_2020_academic_riss.csv

For model analysis and validation, extracted landslides were randomly selected and divided into two groups. The landslide causative factors such as slope, aspect, curvature, topographic wetness index, elevation, forest type, forest crown density, geology, land-use, soil drainage, and soil texture were used in the analysis. Moreover, to identify the correlation between landslides and causative factors, pixels were divided into several classes and frequency ratio was also extracted. A landslide susceptibility map was constructed using a bayesian predictive model (BPM) based on the entire events.In the cross validation process, the landslide susceptibility map as well as observation data were plotted with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve then the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated and tried to extract a success rate curve. The results showed that, the BPM produced 85.8% accuracy. We believed that the model was acceptable for the landslide susceptibility analysis of the study area.

It seems that such processes will have a bridging role in allowing teachers to create creative curriculums together with young children in an age that emphasizes the practice of teachers autonomously creating curriculums.",random_forest_2020_academic_riss.csv

Image Quality Assessment by Combining Masking Texture and Perceptual Color Difference Model,2020,"['Image quality assessment', 'full-reference', 'masking texture', 'color difference', 'human visual system']",,"Objective image quality assessment (IQA) models have been developed by effective features to imitate the characteristics of human visual system (HVS). Actually, HVS is extremely sensitive to color degradation and complex texture changes. In this paper, we firstly reveal that many existing full reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) methods can hardly measure the image quality with contrast and masking texture changes. To solve this problem, considering texture masking effect, we proposed a novel FR-IQA method, called Texture and Color Quality Index (TCQI). The proposed method considers both in the masking effect texture and color visual perceptual threshold, which adopts three kinds of features to reflect masking texture, color difference and structural information. Furthermore, random forest (RF) is used to address the drawbacks of existing pooling technologies. Compared with other traditional learning-based tools (support vector regression and neural network), RF can achieve the better prediction performance. Experiments conducted on five large-scale databases demonstrate that our approach is highly consistent with subjective perception, outperforms twelve the state-of-the-art IQA models in terms of prediction accuracy and keeps a moderate computational complexity. The cross database validation also validates our approach achieves the ability to maintain high robustness.",random_forest_2020_academic_riss.csv

In 2013, a total of 259 landslides occurred in Chuncheon, Gangwon Province, South Korea, due to heavy rainfall events with a total cumulative rainfall of 296~721mm in 106~231 hours duration. Landslides data were mapped with better accuracy using the geographic information system (ArcGIS 10.6 version) based on the historic landslide records in Chuncheon from the National Disaster Management System (NDMS), the 2013 landslide investigation report, orthographic images, and aerial photographs. Then the landslides were randomly split into a testing dataset (70%; 181 landslides) and validation dataset (30%; 78 landslides). First, geo-environmental variables were analyzed by using FR and EBF functions for the full data. The most significant factors related to landslides were altitude (100~200m), slope (15~25°), concave plan curvature, high SPI, young timber age, loose timber density, small timber diameter, artificial forests, coniferous forests, soil depth (50~100cm), very well-drained area, sandy loam soil and so on. Second, the landslide susceptibility index was calculated by using selected geo-environmental variables. The model fit and prediction performance were evaluated using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and the Area Under Curve (AUC) methods. The AUC values of both model fit and prediction performance were 80.5% and 76.3% for FR and 76.6% and 74.9% for EBF respectively. However, the landslide susceptibility index, with classes of ‘very high’ and ‘high’, was detected by 73.1% of landslides in the EBF model rather than the FR model (66.7%). Therefore, the EBF can be a promising method for spatial prediction of landslide occurrence, while the FR is still a powerful method for the landslide susceptibility mapping.",random_forest_2020_academic_riss.csv

A landslide inventory map of the study area was prepared based on past historical information and aerial photography analysis. A total of 550 landslides have been counted at the whole study area. The extracted landslides were randomly selected and divided into two different groups, 50% of the landslides were used for model calibration and the other were used for validation purpose. Eleven causative factors (continuous and thematic) such as slope, aspect, curvature, topographic wetness index, elevation, forest type, forest crown density, geology, land-use, soil drainage, and soil texture were used in hazard analysis. The correlation between landslides and these factors, pixels were divided into several classes and frequency ratio was also extracted. Eventually, a landslide susceptibility map was constructed using a logistic regression model based on entire events. Moreover, the landslide susceptibility map was plotted with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calculated the area under the curve (AUC) and tried to extract a success rate curve. Based on the results, logistic regression produced an 85.18% accuracy, so we believed that the model was reliable and acceptable for the landslide susceptibility analysis on the study area. In addition, for risk assessment, vulnerability scale were added for social thematic data layer. The study area predictive landslide affected pixels 2,000 and 5,000 were also calculated for making a probability table. In final calculation, the 2,000 predictive landslide affected pixels were assumed to run.

We constructed 230,639 matchups from the raw data over 3 million and built an RF (random forest) model from the matchups to cope with the complexity and nonlinearity. The validation statistics from the blind test showed excellent accuracy with the RMSE (root mean square error) of 9.905 μg/m3 and the CC (correlation coefficient) of 0.918. Moreover, our prediction model showed a stable performance without the dependency on seasons or the degree of PM10 concentration. However, part of coastal areas had a relatively low accuracy, which implies that a dedicated model for coastal areas will be necessary. Additional input variables such as wind direction, precipitation, and air stability should also be incorporated into the prediction model as future work.",random_forest_2020_academic_riss.csv

Despite several improvements in the drug development pipeline over the past 30 years, failures have skyrocketed at all stages of clinical trials owing to safety reasons. To improve the success rate of clinical trials, it is necessary to identify drug candidates that may fail in the clinical trials. Therefore, we need to develop reliable models to predict the outcomes of clinical trials of drug candidates. In this paper, we propose a deep multimodal classification model based on informative chemical features of the drugs and target-based features. Experimental results reported on the PrOCTOR dataset indicate that the proposed model performs better in a multimodal setting. Comparing ensemble models based on random forests and extra trees, the proposed deep multimodal classifier obtains the highest value for the area under the receiver operator curve and area under the precision-recall curve.

In general, it is known that human factors leading to the crash occurrence include drowsiness, aggressiveness, and inattention etc. This study mainly focused on underlying factors resulting in such human factors that have been widely addressed to date in the area of traffic safety. Crash investigation systems focus on the road geometry, road environment factor and the driver’s risk driving behavior, human factor. However, less efforts have been made in collecting data related to internal factors of crashes that affect driving behavior. For example, the internal factors include taxi driver’s health characteristics, living conditions and taxi company’s working environment. The purpose of this study is to derive the factors of taxi company’s safety level and to propose a new direction for taxi safety consulting. In-depth interviews with commercial taxi drivers and managers of taxi companies were conducted to collect survey data to represent internal factors associated with driver’s working and welfare environments. In addition to a multiple linear regression, a binomial logistic regression and a random forest analysis technique were adopted to derive underlying internal factors to be used to identify the level of traffic safety taxi companies. The results show that the identified contributing factors include weekly working hours, accident-involved vehicle management, privately-used hour, narrow space inside the vehicle, fatigue management, and the level of life satisfaction.

Semi-supervised based Unknown Attack Detection in EDR Environment,2020,"['Endpoint Security', 'EDR', 'Unknown Attack Detection', 'AutoEncoder', '1D CNN']",,"Cyberattacks penetrate the server and perform various malicious acts such as stealing confidential information, destroying systems, and exposing personal information. To achieve this, attackers perform various malicious actions by infecting endpoints and accessing the internal network. However, the current countermeasures are only anti-viruses that operate in a signature or pattern manner, allowing initial unknown attacks. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) technology is focused on providing visibility, and strong countermeasures are lacking. If you fail to respond to the initial attack, it is difficult to respond additionally because malicious behavior like Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack does not occur immediately, but occurs over a long period of time. In this paper, we propose a technique that detects an unknown attack using an event log without prior knowledge, although the initial response failed with anti-virus. The proposed technology uses a combination of AutoEncoder and 1D CNN (1-Dimention Convolutional Neural Network) based on semi-supervised learning. The experiment trained a dataset collected over a month in a real-world commercial endpoint environment, and tested the data collected over the next month. As a result of the experiment, 37 unknown attacks were detected in the event log collected for one month in the actual commercial endpoint environment, and 26 of them were verified as malicious through VirusTotal (VT).

The method combines the expected error reduction (EER) dependent rollback learning and the active semi-supervised learning (ASSL) for a rapid adaptive CNN detector. Most CNN object detectors are built on the assumption of static data distribution. However, images are often noisy and biased, and the data distribution is imbalanced in a real world environment. The proposed method consists of collaborative sampling and EER-ASSL. The EER-ASSL utilizes the active learning (AL) and rollback based semi-supervised learning (SSL). The AL allows us to select more informative and representative samples measuring uncertainty and diversity. The SSL divides the selected streaming image samples into the bins and each bin repeatedly transfers the discriminative knowledge of the EER and CNN models to the next bin until convergence and incorporation with the EER rollback learning algorithm is achieved. The EER models provide a rapid short-term myopic adaptation and the CNN models an incremental long-term performance improvement.

The patients were nonrandomly assigned to each resident. Data from a prospectively collected database were reviewed and analyzed retrospectively. Perioperative outcomes including operation time, complications, and conversion were compared among the 3 residents. The LC was evaluated using the moving average method and cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) for operation time and surgical completion.Results: Baseline characteristics and perioperative outcomes were similar among the 3 groups except for age and location of the appendix. The operation time did not vary among the 3 residents (43.9, 45.3, and 48.4 minutes for A, B, and C, respectively; P=0.392).

In this paper, we propose a novel fuzzy relational semi-supervised clustering algorithm based on an adaptive local distance measure (SSRF-CA). The proposed clustering algorithm utilizes side-information and formulates it as a set of constraints to supervise the learning task. These constraints are expressed using reward and penalty terms, which are integrated into a novel objective function. In particular, we formulate the clustering task as an optimization problem through the minimization of the proposed objective function. Solving this optimization problem provides the optimal values of different objective function parameters and yields the proposed semi-supervised clustering algorithm. Along with its ability to perform data clustering and learn the underlying dissimilarity measure between the data instances, our algorithm determines the optimal number of clusters in an unsupervised manner. Moreover, the proposed SSRF-CA is designed to handle relational data. This makes it appropriate for applications where only pairwise similarity (or dissimilarity) information between data instances is available.

The process of extracting feature information of an object grasp and estimating the joint angles of the robot are performed at one time from one deep neural network. There is a time-consuming and difficult pre-processing for deep learning in the robot grasping that sufficient data such as a high-quality three-dimensional object model composed of multi-modal sensor information must be secured. We use a relatively small amount of RGB images captured by the head camera and wrist camera to minimize the effort. We present a system that performs the entire grasping operation with two identical structures of deep neural networks, and generate an image focused on a target object using a semantic segmentation technique to maximize efficiency by using it as an input of the first deep neural network. We propose a method to solve various one-to-many matching situations that occur in robot grasping by modifying the Mixture Density Network(MDN) to output the amount of change from the current to the next joint angles. Each learning weight of joints is trained as a learning variable or random constants are given to the training weights of robot joints in the kernel function.

In this study, we recognized the limitation of real data collection and used both the auto-encoder, the unsupervised learning model, and the LSTM, the supervised learning model. Autoencoder, an unsupervised learning model, trained normal behavioral data to learn patterns for normal behavior, and LSTM further refined classification by learning behaviors that could be perceived by sensors.

According to this work, during the monarch’s reign, 153 items of books amounting to over 4,000 fascicles were compiled. Texts compiled under his direct supervision 御定書 alone amount to over 2,000 fascicles. When works compiled by the king’s closest scholar-officials 士大夫 including those affiliated with the Royal Library and Archives 奎章閣 at his order 命撰書 are included here as well, the total amounts to more than 4,000 fascicles. Included in this collection are numerous unique works that provide a glimpse of King Jeongjo’s academic and political opinions such as his poetry collection, Gyeongsa Gangui 經史講義 (records of academic seminars on Confucian classics and ancient East Asian histories between him and his ministers), Simnirok 審理錄 (his trial records), and Ildeungnok 日得錄 (records of his oral statements).Out of the many documents compiled during King Jeongjo’s reign, the Daehak Yuui 大學類義 was the most crucial one as a textbook on statecraft for future rulers. For the effective governance and edification of the populace, the Xiaoxue 小學, Oryun Haengsildo 五倫行實圖, and Hyangnye Happyeon 鄕禮合編 (collection of compacts for self-governing villages) were the most important texts. However, a task that was very important both politically and ideologically was the monarch’s collection of Zhu Xi studies 朱子學 texts for over 20 years and compilation of the best versions. Moreover, he planned to compile a complete edition of the Zhuzi Quanshu 朱子全書 in his late years. When King Jeongjo’s academic tendency is summarized, he saw Zhu Xi studies as the highest learning and truth. This was not simply an academic question but was a question linked to the validity of the ruler’s political power and power management. Because the validity of power was granted through the legitimacy of learning in Joseon, as a politician and the supreme commander, the monarch had no choice but to declare that Zhu Xi studies was the correct learning.The compilation of immense documents and the plan to compile the Zhuzi Quanshu under King Jeongjo’s rule constituted public declarations that the synthesizer of Confucianism, or the inheritor of the ideology’s lineage, was the monarch himself. Indeed, he prided himself on having succeeded to the truth of Confucianism from the wise kings of the three ancient Chinese dynasties, Confucius, and Zhu Xi. King Jeongjo believed that he was capable of practicing the way of a teacher 師道 and the way of a ruler 君道 at the same time, that he could become a true ruler-teacher 君師. He held the belief that only monarchs could become true ruler-teachers. At the same time, he also had the conviction that he had become a ruler-teacher based on his learning and morality and therefore was capable of establishing ji 極, the standard of human life. While kings could become ruler-teachers by cultivating themselves academically and morally, scholar-officials, even if they performed the same task, could not necessary become kings. Consequently, King Jeongjo thought that, in the end, the only one who could bridge the gap between learning and politics, between knowledge and reality, was none other than himself.Both King Jeongjo and contemporary Korean Confucians sought to find the validity of political actions or political power in the perfection of character or the completion of learning. In this respect, they can seem to have stressed morality and learning based on a theory of human nature or metaphysics rather than the uniqueness of politics or power itself.

Self-supervision has been regarded as the process of applying all things the supervisee has learned from the supervisor to his(her) own clinical work. However, with the influence of constructionism, self-supervision has come to imply all dynamics, feelings, and thoughts between counselor and client of the present time and the process after counseling sessions. From that point of view, self-supervision cannot be regarded as a future goal but can be a goal from the early stage of supervisee training. Reflection is the core concept of self-supervision, Reflection means to think deeply about something in the past. Also, reflection focuses on relational dynamics, feeling, thinking, belief, value, attitude, and insight of the present time. However, general reflective questions and reflective thinking are not enough to make our counseling become pastoral counseling. For this reason, this study accepts the frame of theological reflection by Patricia O’Connell Killen and John de Beer. Theological reflection pursues the conversation between our experiences and Christian spiritual traditions. A spiritual journal can be a tool to process conversation between our experiences and Christian spiritual traditions and as a vessel to exteriorize and contain insights gained from the process. If counselor trainees use a spiritual journal as a tool of self-supervision from the early stage of clinical training, they can proceed with self-supervision independently even after completing their mandatory training course. In their self-supervision, all things that they had learned from previous supervision will be reactivated. Furthermore, a spiritual journal will contribute to open the field to experience intimacy with God and the dynamic work of the Holy Spirit in pastoral counseling and supervision.",supervised_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv
Unsupervised Deformable Image Registration Using Polyphase UNet for 3D Brain MRI Volumes,2020,"['Polyphase decomposition', 'Unsupervised learning', 'Medical image registration']",,"Purpose: Image registration is a fundamental task in various medical imaging studies and clinical image analyses, such as comparison of patient data with anatomical structures. In order to solve the problems of conventional image registration approaches, such as long computational time, recent deep-learning supervised and unsupervised methods have been extensively studied because of their excellent performance and fast computational time. In this study, we propose a deep-learningbased network for deformable medical image registration using unsupervised learning.Materials and Methods: In this paper, we solve the image-registration optimization problem by modelling a function using a convolutional neural network with polyphase decomposition to learn the spatial transformable parameters based on the input images and to generate the registration field. A spatial transformer is used to reconstruct the output warped image while imposing smoothness constraints on the registration field. With polyphase decomposition, our proposed method learns more features based on the input image pairs without the need for any ground-truth registration field.Results: Experimental results using 3D T1 brain MRI volume scans and compared with state-of-the-art image-registration methods demonstrated that our method provides better 3D-image registration.Conclusion: Our proposed method uses less computational time in registering unseen pairs of input images during inference and can be applied for other unimodal image registration tasks, and the hyper-parameters can be adjusted for the specific task.",supervised_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Such abnormal neurological interaction might provoke a deleterious side-effect, which is called cybersickness. In order to guarantee viewer’s safety, producer and provider have to predict the degree of cybersickness prior to regulating the related attribute of a VR content. Unfortunately, previous researches on cybersickness have only focused on the mutually independent factors. To cope with this problem, we propose a novel scheme for prediction of the level of cybersickness by employing the supervised learning. Towards this, 52 synthetic VR scenes are newly generated, and then the subjective opinions are collected through a large-scale clinical evaluation with participation of 150 volunteers. To capture the robust representations of cybersickness, 17 spatial perceptual features are extracted including the processed raw data which represent the visual-vestibular sensory conflict, the estimated visual sensitivity and complexity from RGB images, and the depth information. Moreover, the extracted spatial perceptual features are transformed to the temporal perceptual features by deploying four pooling methods which reflects the human’s visual characteristics. The extracted features are regressed onto the ground-truth (i.e., the rated score), thus the prediction of quantified level of cybersickness can be achieved by using the trained model, and whose predictive performance has ∼76% correlated relationship with the subjective opinions.",supervised_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

To meet the objectives, the action researchers collected various data to conduct an inductive analysis. These data included the contents of conferences with kindergarten field experts, videos of the primary and secondary simulated instructions by pre-service early childhood teachers, lesson plans and teaching aids for the primary and secondary simulated instructions, reflective journals for simulated instructional improvement, and research notes by the researchers. The implementation process to improve the simulated instructions in connection with field experts was classified into three stages. The first stage was planning, including the reflection and correction of existing simulated instructions as well as the fundamental consultation with field experts for instructional improvement. The second stage of execution involved preparation for the primary simulated instruction, execution and recording, and conducting an assessment conference on the primary simulated instruction with fellow pre-service teachers and university professors. The third stage was re-execution, where pre-service early childhood teachers discussed the direction of the secondary simulated instruction with field experts and prepared for the instruction, based on the primary simulated instruction execution and assessment process. Subsequently, the secondary simulated instruction execution and re-reflection process was followed through in-person guidance by the field experts visiting the university with the aim of instructional improvement. As a result of the simulated instructional improvement process implemented in connection with field experts, the pre-service early childhood teachers came to be able to more precisely recognize the current status of the kindergarten field. In addition, they were able to understand instructional improvement in the direction possible to more effectively interact with the actual learning level of preschoolers. All of these procedures also provided both field experts and pre-service early childhood teachers, including the action researchers, with an opportunity to enhance teaching professionalism.

It is a system whereby the company distributes part of the shares to employees in a certain form according to established rules, and the owner shares the ownership and future earnings with employees. In practice, there is not only a conflict of interest between the company and the employees, but also a conflict caused by the dual identity of the employees. How to resolve this contradiction and prevent the legal risks caused by the implementation of the employee shareholding system has become an urgent problem to be solved. From the perspective of practice and combining with theory, this paper takes the employee shareholding system of listed companies as the research object, focuses on the overall system construction of the employee shareholding system of listed companies, learns experience from relevant laws and regulations of employee shareholding system outside the region, and puts forward Suggestions for the construction of relevant legal system in China. The employee stock ownership system has been developed for decades in China, and so far three shareholding modes have been formed, namely: trust shareholding mode, limited partnership shareholding mode and corporate enterprise mode. The mode of trust shareholding mainly establishes a trust shareholding platform according to the provisions of the trust law and manages the employee shareholding plan in the form of trust fund. Limited partnership shareholding mode is a kind of shareholding mode according to the partnership law. It is a way to establish multiple limited partnerships in a nested way, so as to establish and manage employee shareholding plan with minimum cost. The shareholding mode of the company system requires the enterprise to manage the employee shareholding plan by establishing a joint stock limited company and using the articles of association according to the provisions of the company law. Through the analysis of the employee stock ownership system in China, it is found that there are such problems as the high proportion of senior executives, the lack of supervision of the employee stock ownership system, the imperfect exit mechanism and the obvious externalization of employee stock. In view of these problems, it is suggested that the employee stock ownership system should be supervised and managed at both central and local levels. From the central level, the “management measures of employee stock ownership system” is formulated, and the problems in the acquisition of employee stock, equity exercise and withdrawal of employee stock ownership system are regulated, and the regulatory system of employee stock ownership system is regulated from the two aspects of clarifying the regulatory subject and improving the internal supervision. It is suggested that the local government issue relevant regulations to guide the development of esop in the region. The paper consists of introduction, text and conclusion, forming a relatively complete article system. In the first chapter of the main body, the general concept of the ESOP of listed companies is expounded, and from the concept, characteristics and significance of employee stock ownership, we have a comprehensive understanding of the ESOP of listed companies. The second chapter focuses on the domestic employee shareholding system, first, to review the development process of employee shareholding system in our country, and through the analysis of employee shareholding system in our country listed company of three models, and our country listed company employees within the ESOP, exercise, and exit the three stages of law system, it is concluded that China’s listed company employee shareholding system in the legislative and regulatory shortcomings. Next to the employee shareholding system outside of comparative analysis, from the perspective of comparative law research on the outside of employee shareholding system mode and the legal system is analyzed, in expanding the scope of the shareholding employees subject and ensure employee stock shareholders' rights and interests of the shareholders, complete and comprehensive of employee shareholding system legislation protecting and comprehensive guide, make the employee shareholding system perfecting of our country. But because the countries outside with economic system and legal system in our country some difference in different degree, therefore to the outside of employee shareholding system take the essence to the dregs, from standard system, establish the regulators and perfect the laws and regulations and so on omni-directional constructing China’s legal system of employee shareholding stake, promote the development of employee shareholding system of listed companies in our country.",supervised_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

It is easy to use since it does not require a mesh, in contrast with the finite element method. However, the method of finite spheres uses rational interpolation functions based on the Shepard functions. Thus, it requires more integration points to integrate the element matrices accurately, resulting in poor computational efficiency. In this regard, research on Gaussian quadrature for the method of finite spheres has been conducted, however, it still implies a large computational cost. Therefore, we propose an algorithm for optimizing the weights of Gaussian quadrature using supervised learning.

In the pre-training process, self-supervised learning is performed, which relies entirely on training data. If we introduce the linguistic knowledge in the course of the training, it would be possible to get better result more effectively.

Image classification is to determine which category the given image belongs to. Since the image classification is a typical supervised learning, test images and the corresponding answers, i.e., labels are also given. And, with the given test images and labels, a neural network is trained to minimize a loss function defined by error between the label and the inference result. Therefore, as the loss decreases, the inference accuracy increases. As a result, the accuracy is a criteria of the performance of the neural network in image classification. In this paper, a new method for high accuracy image classification is suggested. Authors thinks that recognizing things mean seeing the shape of the things. With the intuition, in the proposed method, additional edge information is applied to the image and around 3% accuracy improvement is achieved in the experiment. In order to clarify the improvement, compared feature maps in the hidden layers are visualized and analyzed. And, it is also confirmed that the feature map of the proposed method is more clear and sharp than that of the conventional one. Another merit of the proposed method is that this method can easily improve the accuracy of the conventionally existing neural networks through the transfer learning because the proposed method just modifies the first layer of the conventional neural networks.",supervised_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

While existing map technologies may assist vehicles in identifying their locations via Global Positioning System, it is however difficult to update the environmental changes of roadways in these maps. Roadway vision algorithms can be useful for building autonomous vehicles that can avoid accidents and detect real-time location changes. We incorporate a hybrid architectural design that combines unsupervised classification of vision data with supervised joint fusion classification to achieve a better noise-resistant algorithm. We identify, via a deep learning approach, an intelligent hybrid fusion algorithm for fusing multimodal vision feature data for roadway classifications and characterize its improvement in accuracy over unsupervised identifications using image processing and supervised vision classifiers. We analyzed over 93,000 vision frame data collected from a test vehicle in real roadways.

Document Image Binarization by GAN with Unpaired Data Training,2020,"['document image binarization', 'unpaired training data', 'gan', 'unsupervised learning']",,"Data is critical in deep learning but the scarcity of data often occurs in research, especially in the preparation of the paired training data. In this paper, document image binarization with unpaired data is studied by introducing adversarial learning, excluding the need for supervised or labeled datasets. However, the simple extension of the previous unpaired training to binarization inevitably leads to poor performance compared to paired data training. Thus, a new deep learning approach is proposed by introducing a multidiversity of higher quality generated images. In this paper, a two-stage model is proposed that comprises the generative adversarial network (GAN) followed by the U-net network. In the first stage, the GAN uses the unpaired image data to create paired image data. With the second stage, the generated paired image data are passed through the U-net network for binarization. Thus, the trained U-net becomes the binarization model during the testing. The proposed model has been evaluated over the publicly available DIBCO dataset and it outperforms other techniques on unpaired training data. The paper shows the potential of using unpaired data for binarization, for the first time in the literature, which can be further improved to replace paired data training for binarization in the future.",supervised_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

In addition, researches on end-to-end (E2E) speech recognition systems integrating language modeling and decoding processes have been actively conducted to better utilize the advantages of deep learning techniques. In general, E2E ASR systems consist of multiple layers of encoder-decoder structure with attention. Therefore, E2E ASR systems require data with a large amount of speech-text paired data in order to achieve good performance. Obtaining speech-text paired data requires a lot of human labor and time, and is a high barrier to building E2E ASR system. Therefore, there are previous studies that improve the performance of E2E ASR system using relatively small amount of speech-text paired data, but most studies have been conducted by using only speech-only data or text-only data.

Text classification is of particular importance for quantitative historical analysis because it helps to search literature efficiently and to determine the important subjects of a particular age. While numerous historians have joined together to classify large-scale historical documents, consistent classification among individual researchers has not been achieved. In this study, we present a classification method for large-scale historical data that uses a recently developed supervised learning algorithm called the Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN). By applying various classification methods to the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty (AJD), we show that HAN is more accurate than conventional techniques with word-frequency-based features. HAN provides the extent that a particular sentence or word contributes to the classification process through a quantitative value called `attention'. We extract the representative keywords from various categories by using the attention mechanism and show the evolution of the keywords over the 472-year span of the AJD. Our results reveal that largely two groups of event categories are found in the AJD. In one group, the representative keywords of the categories were stable over long periods while the keywords in the other group varied rapidly, exhibiting repeatedly changing characteristics of the categories.

Thus, given a particular domain such as hotel, the sentiment lexicon should be constructed so that many of the domain-dependent words reflect the meaning of the domain. Using the domain-dependent sentiment lexicon will render more accurate results than using existing sentiment lexicons that do not consider domain-dependent words in the sentiment analysis. To build the domain-dependent sentiment lexicons, various studies have been presented, but there are many limitations including the human intervention and the use of local information rather than contextual information. In this paper, we propose a novel method of automatically constructing a domain-dependent sentiment lexicon based on the global and contextual information and an existing sentiment lexicon (i.e., KNU sentiment lexicon, Glove vector, Conjunction relation).",supervised_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv
원형 구조 알고리즘을 이용한 근전도 패턴 인식 및 분류,2020,"['Electromyography', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Classification', 'Deep Learning']",,"This paper proposes a pattern recognition and classification algorithm based on a circular structure that can reflect the characteristics of the sEMG (surface electromyogram) signal measured in the arm without putting the placement limitation of electrodes. In order to recognize the same pattern at all times despite the electrode locations, the data acquisition of the circular structure is proposed so that all sEMG channels can be connected to one another. For the performance verification of the sEMG pattern recognition and classification using the developed algorithm, several experiments are conducted. First, although there are no differences in the sEMG signals themselves, the similar patterns are much better identified in the case of the circular structure algorithm than that of conventional linear ones. Second, a comparative analysis is shown with the supervised learning schemes such as MLP, CNN, and LSTM. In the results, the classification recognition accuracy of the circular structure is above 98% in all postures. It is much higher than the results obtained when the linear structure is used. The recognition difference between the circular and linear structures was the biggest with about 4% when the MLP network was used.",supervised_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv
Estimation of Maximum Strains and Loads in Aircraft Landing Using Artificial Neural Network,2020,['Structural health monitoring \xa0· Hard landing \xa0· Artifi cial neural network \xa0· Supervised learning'],,"Hard landings account for a large proportion of aircraft accidents and are generally judged by the intuition of pilots. For this reason, there are frequent false judgments that lead to unnecessary and costly ground inspections. False judgments can be reduced significantly if detailed load information is available, such as strains or loads on critical areas of aircraft structures. This study used an artificial neural network (ANN) to develop a numerical model that can estimate the maximum strains for areas of interest and landing loads from basic flight parameters. The results can be used to provide the required detailed load information. An efficient and accurate landing simulation model was constructed and used to build reliable datasets for training. Basic flight parameters from immediately after touchdown were used as input data for training, and the corresponding maximum values of strains and landing loads were obtained from the landing simulation model as target data for training. This information was used to train the ANNs with the Levenberg–Marquardt backpropagation algorithm. A performance evaluation using test data confirmed that the trained ANNs can successfully estimate strains and landing loads with sufficient accuracy.",supervised_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

As a result of multi-level negative binomial regression analysis using HLM 8.0 software, as the level of bullying victimization of a specific wave increased, the level of delinquency at the same wave also increased. Also, this effect was amplified as the level of average delinquent peer association across waves increased.

In order to maintain the impact of big data on safety evaluation classified in four stages, risk identification must be conducted. Next, the hazard characteristics should be described. In addition, more accurate information collection should be conducted by evaluating the disclosure of the evaluation data and describing the characteristics of risk.In relation to the improvement of the legal system of food safety management by applying big data, first, the standardization of the food management supervision and legal system should be drastically progressed. In particular, the standards for information processing and distribution of agricultural products in rural areas should be significantly complemented. In addition, the type and scope of safety evaluation, evaluation time, and evaluation unit must also be determined by law. It is also necessary to seriously discuss the extent to which the information is collected and the degree of sharing of the collected data. In the process, there should be no excessive infringement or misunderstanding of personal information. For this, first of all, a dual system should be established, led by a government agency in relation to food safety management, and actively involved with food safety management entities. Domestic and international cooperation measures should be prepared.Providing user feedback should also be provided appropriately. The confusion due to the overlapping management of the governmental organizations should also accurately share the roles according to their respective tasks. First of all, it is necessary to construct a big data platform for food tracking, because there has been no unified tracking system related to food distribution. Five institutions, including home, school, city office of education, market supervisory authority and franchise department, monitor channels according to remote remote control methods, learn platform-directed management supervision, build a reporting system when finding issues at each stage, interlock three-step actions and take action results A five-dimensional food safety management system called satisfaction evaluation must be established.In the case of a food tracking system represented by beef using a blockchain, the parts that can be a certain topic are as follows. Since Ethereum is a safe and authoritative authority in blockchain technology, it is necessary to actively utilize Ethereum. In the process of promoting the beef supply chain tracking system, the authority management of system users is an issue. With this in mind, the Ethereum system does not have a solution on its own, but will be able to satisfy the actual demand by adding a rights management model outside the blockchain system.Speaking of the consumer, through the sequence number of the food packaging, detailed distribution information corresponding to it in the database protected by the Consumer Protection Agency will be investigated, and if the integrity of the information is checked, the key information stored in the blockchain and database search Data is compared and if both are equally unchanged since the system’s registration of the data, data can be considered complete. Two ways of the Ethereum platform can store data on the blockchain. First, the block is considered as a unit element, and data is added within every single block. Second, it takes the form of a transaction and sends the data to the blockchain. More research should be conducted on tracking systems such as the Java Web system.",supervised_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

The most important issue in the medical field shortly after the founding of Joseon was who would be responsible for medical practice, such as the establishment and implementation of medical policy, medical learning, and patient treatment.The founding forces of Joseon, who witnessed the problems of medical care at the end of Goryeo, educated the young people of the Yangin (良人) class and instated the current literary officials into medical affairs. Subsequently, under the reign of King Sejong (世宗), the medical learning officer program (醫書習讀 官) was conducted. The program was a system for training medical professionals by intensively educating the young people of the ruling class.This position to train medical professionals at the national level can be called a well-informed Confucianist theory (通儒論). The position of this theory that Confucian scholars should be fluent in all fields is also seen in the Chilhak (七 學, seven schools) under the reign of King Sejo (世祖).The well-informed Confucianist theory was strongly opposed by the Yangban(兩班) class, including current officials who promoted the discrimination theory (職分論). They argued that everyone has a fixed position, and that the medical bureau was the position that professional medical personnel were in charge of.These two positions were challenged throughout the 15th century until a compromise was reached. The compromise was that the ruling class would be in charge of the supervision of the medical bureau and a part of the medical education, while professional medical personnel would be in charge of the practice of medical care such as patient treatment, medical book compilation, and medical profession.",supervised_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Most of the previous studies overlooked this problem and focused only on improving the structure of their artificial neural networks. As a result, a number of new attacks were frequently classified as normal traffic, and attack traffic classification performance was severly degraded. On the other hand, the softmax function, which outputs the probability that each class is correctly classified in the multi-class classification as a result, also has a significant impact on the classification performance because it fails to calculate the softmax score properly for a new type of attack traffic that has not been trained.

Optimum LED Coverage Utilization in OCC for Effective Communication with Mobile Robot,2020,"['Bit-error rate (BER)', 'image sensor', 'light emitting diode (LED)', 'mobile robot (MR)', 'tilt angle.']",,"Optical camera communication (OCC) is a promisingtechnology for camera-mounted mobile robots (MRs), where it canuse its camera to communicate with light-emitting diode (LED) infrastructures. Due to the limited angle of view of current commercial cameras used in MRs, the cameras cannot detect LED everywhere inside an area illuminated by an LED; hence, much ofthe illumination surface remains unutilized. Herein, we propose anautomatic camera inflection algorithm to successfully detect LEDanywhere inside an LED cell (the total coverage area illuminatedby LED). The inflection mechanism is a supervised learning approach. The technique utilizes the coordinate information (i.e., Xand Y coordinates) of an LED cell, which is further employed totrack the position of the LED. The coordinate data is automaticallyupdated when the MR travels from one position to another. Furthermore, we perform simulations that include a discussion on tiltangle variation with increasing distance traveled by the MR and aperformance analysis that demonstrates the importance and feasibility of the developed algorithm. Finally, a testbed prototype forOCC is implemented to demonstrate the proof of angle measurement theory and bit-error-rate performance of the proposed system.",supervised_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

He integrated mind of supervision and wonderful operation with human nature as systematic organization (條理) and true nature (實體) saying that mind is supervision and suggestion, nature of humaneness, rightness, ritual decorum, and wisdom means when mind is expressed and gets to be different, which is the expansion of the theory of one principle with different manifestations. Accordingly, for divine beings (神明) and numinous emptiness (虛靈), he defined divine beings as Body of Li, numinous emptiness as Use of Li, and Myeongdeok as Li (理). Like this, the viewpoint to combine mind and nature with each other and consider Myeongdeok as Li deepened Nosa's theories of human nature and mind and i and ki.the Deepening Process of the Theory of Li (主理論) represses self- interest, restores courtesy, and has the significance of administration theory that emphasizes human order.

Based on the literature reviews, the child-centered education, the naturalistic teaching and the least prompting strategies were suggested as the effective methods to increase the levels of participation of young children with disabilities in the play. In conclusion, the process of supporting young children with disabilities to participate in free play was schematized based on child-centered and play-centered education. Lastly, the research on the actual practice in the field was suggested as a follow-up study.",supervised_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

The researcher surveyed 449 elementary school children from three schools in different living conditions in the Sosa district of Bucheon City, Korea. The results of the research indicate that since COVID-19 appeared, online classes have been insufficient for including various content, retaining students’ concentration and interest, and producing an educational effect. For students living in poorer conditions, the educational effect of online classes has been even worse. Elementary school children’s educational discourse, according to the classes with living conditions, is maintained through private education and self-directed learning ability. Concerning schoolroom classes during COVID-19, students’ interaction with their teachers and friends has decreased significantly. Since the time children spend with their parents has increased due to COVID-19, family relations have improved. However, game use time has increased by 13 minutes. Moreover, the rate of children living without adult supervision during the day is now 32.3%, and the recreational space in the areas with poor living conditions is unprepared for this change.",supervised_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

The results of this study are as follows. At the curriculum development stage, the principal has provided enough time for teachers to design the curriculum and set the educational goals. The principal provided legal knowledge for designing the curriculum. In the curriculum implementation, the principal tried to settle the importance of the class into the culture. In order to improve the quality of the teaching and learning, the principal has set up a consulting service and has established NSLB and diploma system. In order to evaluate the curriculum, the principal conducted questionnaires, interviewed department heads, and operated the TRF to investigate the problems and remedies of the school curriculum. Finally, the principal created a department responsible for the school curriculum and an operating system centered on the curriculum. The principals operated GAT, TRF, supervision and in-service training in order to raise job maturity and psychological maturity.  Based on this, a recommendation for future research is as follows. Due to the context of the new school, the principal was able to actively participate in the process of developing the school curriculum, and after that, it was possible to manage the entire school curriculum under the supervision of the principal. This suggests that it is limited to the heads of general schools, which are difficult to participate from the development stage of the school curriculum. In the future study, we hope that research will be conducted to reveal the best practices of the principal’s school curriculum management in high schools.",supervised_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv
Knowledge Representation Using Decision Trees Constructed Based on Binary Splits,2020,"['Knowledge representation', 'decision trees', 'binary split', 'directed acyclic graph']",,"It is tremendously important to construct decision trees to use as a tool for knowledge representation from a given decision table. However, the usual algorithms may split the decision table based on each value, which is not efficient for numerical attributes. The methodology of this paper is to split the given decision table into binary groups as like the CART algorithm, that uses binary split to work for both categorical and numerical attributes. The difference is that it uses split for each attribute established by the directed acyclic graph in a dynamic programming fashion whereas, the CART uses binary split among all considered attributes in a greedy fashion. The aim of this paper is to study the effect of binary splits in comparison with each value splits when building the decision trees. Such effect can be studied by comparing the number of nodes, local and global misclassification rate among the constructed decision trees based on three proposed algorithms.",decision_tree_2020_academic_riss.csv
Prediction Model for the Risk of Scapular Winging in Young Women Based on the Decision Tree,2020,"['Decision tree', 'Musculoskeletal disease', 'Physical examination']",,"Background: Scapular winging (SW) could be caused by tightness or weakness of the periscapular muscles. Although data mining techniques are useful in classifying or predicting risk of musculoskeletal disorder, predictive models for risk of musculoskeletal disorder using the results of clinical test or quantitative data are scarce.Objects: This study aimed to (1) investigate the difference between young women with and without SW, (2) establish a predictive model for presence of SW, and (3) determine the cutoff value of each variable for predicting the risk of SW using the decision tree method.Methods: Fifty young female subjects participated in this study. To classify the presence of SW as the outcome variable, scapular protractor strength, elbow flexor strength, shoulder internal rotation, and whether the scapula is in the dominant or nondominant side were determined.Results: The classification tree selected scapular protractor strength, shoulder internal rota-tion range of motion, and whether the scapula is in the dominant or nondominant side as predictor variables. The classification tree model correctly classified 78.79% (p = 0.02) of the training data set. The accuracy obtained by the classification tree on the test data set was 82.35% (p = 0.04).Conclusion: The classification tree showed acceptable accuracy (82.35%) and high specific-ity (95.65%) but low sensitivity (54.55%). Based on the predictive model in this study, we suggested that 20% of body weight in scapular protractor strength is a meaningful cutoff value for presence of SW.",decision_tree_2020_academic_riss.csv
Comprehensive Decision-Making for the Leaf-to-Fruit Ratio and Estimation of Economic Output Value of Walnut Trees Based on Statistical Analyses,2020,"['artificial manipulation', 'regression analysis', 'residual analysis', 'source-sink relationship']",,"This study examined the Juglans regia ‘Xinxin2’ walnut variety using combined field control experiments with laboratory chemical analyses and analyzed the effects of the relationships among net photosynthetic rate (Pn), specific mass transfer rate (SMTR), nut dry mass (NDM), and nut yield per girdled fruit-bearing shoot (Yield) on the leaf-to-fruit ratio (LFR). We used comprehensive decision-making based on mathematical programming to determine the optimal LFR for this walnut variety in the peak fruiting stage. The optimal LFR was calculated as the comprehensive expected value of the linear combination among the equations for the effects of LFR on the Pn, SMTR, NDM, and Yield and was determined to be 2.02. Compared with walnut plants without LFR adjustment, the walnut plants with LFR adjustment using 2.02 as the minimum threshold had a 19.52% lower nut yield, a higher nut quality (Special Class, Class I, and Class II accounted for 100% of the nut yield per 670 m2), and a 36.22% higher economic output value per 670 m2. This study indicates that improving fruit quality to produce Grade I and II nuts will increase economic output, although the total yield will decrease when managing efficient LFR in nut production.",decision_tree_2020_academic_riss.csv
A Fast CU Size Decision Optimal Algorithm Based on Neighborhood Prediction for HEVC,2020,"['CU Decision', 'HEVC', 'Neighborhood Prediction', 'Optimal Algorithm']",,"High efficiency video coding (HEVC) employs quadtree coding tree unit (CTU) structure to improve its coding efficiency, but at the same time, it also requires a very high computational complexity due to its exhaustive search processes for an optimal coding unit (CU) partition. With the aim of solving the problem, a fast CU sizedecision optimal algorithm based on neighborhood prediction is presented for HEVC in this paper. The contribution of this paper lies in the fact that we successfully use the partition information of neighborhood CUs in different depth to quickly determine the optimal partition mode for the current CU by neighborhood prediction technology, which can save much computational complexity for HEVC with negligible RDrate(ratedistortion rate) performance loss. Specifically, in our scheme, we use the partition information of left, up, and leftup CUs to quickly predict the optimal partition mode for the current CU by neighborhood prediction technology, as a result, our proposed algorithm can effectively solve the problem above by reducing manyunnecessary prediction and partition operations for HEVC. The simulation results show that our proposed fast CU size decision algorithm based on neighborhood prediction in this paper can reduce about 19.0% coding time, and only increase 0.102% BDrate (Bjontegaard delta rate) compared with the standard reference softwareof HM16.1, thus improving the coding performance of HEVC.",decision_tree_2020_academic_riss.csv

The study used geographic data such as the area of use, geographical data like elevation and slope, the environmental conservation value assessment map, and population density data for 2006 and 2018. It extracted the new urban expansion areas by comparing the residential, industrial, and commercial zones of the zoning in 2006 and 2018 and derived a decision tree using the 2006 data as independent variables. It is intended to forecast urban expansion in 2030 by applying the data for 2018 to the derived decision tree. The analysis result confirmed that the distance from the green area, the elevation, the grade of the environmental conservation value assessment map, and the distance from the industrial area were important factors in forecasting the urban area expansion. The AUC of 0.95051 showed excellent explanatory power in the ROC analysis performed to verify the accuracy. However, the forecast of the urban area expansion for 2018 using the decision tree was 15,459.98㎢, which was significantly different from the actual urban area of 4,144.93㎢ for 2018. Since many regions use decision tree to forecast urban expansion, they can be useful for identifying which factors affect urban expansion, although they are not suitable for forecasting the expansion of urban region in detail. Identifying such important factors for urban expansion is expected to provide information that can be used in future land, urban, and environmental planning.",decision_tree_2020_academic_riss.csv

Since prior research has applied market segmentation to the entire performing arts market, the infrequent attendees have been grouped into one or two sub-market despite the significant volume. Additionally, prior research has divided the market with the researchers’ arbitrary decision on the number of sub-markets and the borderline between them. The current study aims to provide implications for the expansion and improvement of the domestic performing arts market through conducting segmentation focused on infrequent attendees. Methodologically, we utilize the latent class analysis to exclude subjective judgment. Furthermore, decision tree analysis is applied to identify the target market having high market potential among subgroups.As a result, the Korean infrequent attendees were divided into four segments labeled as omnivore market, highbrow market, popular market, and non-attendee market. Among the segments, the omnivore market showed significantly high level of attitude toward and attendance intention on performing arts compared to the other groups. Consistent with existing research, the omnivore market was revealed to have high level of cultural capital. The results of decision tree analysis discovered that participation in performing arts related class, age, perceived social status, household income level, and occupation have a significant effect on separating nodes.The present research acquires importance for attempting segmentation of Korean performing arts market focusing on infrequent attendees, applying latent class model to assure objectivity in the course of segmentation, and discovering significant factors to identify the target market, omnivore market, through decision tree modeling.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of both Korean and foreign languages (multicultural mother’s native language) skills as factors that influence multicultural acceptance among multicultural adolescents. Methods: A decision tree analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between language skills (Korean and foreign languages) predicting multicultural acceptance among 1,439 (2012 yr. 11 years old) and 1,238 (2015 yr. 14 years old) multicultural adolescents in MAPS (Multi-cultural Adolescents Panel Survey) by the NYPI (National Youth Policy Institute). Results: For multicultural adolescents who are 11 years old and in the fifth grade of elementary school, the ability of multicultural adolescents to speak Korean and the ability of mothers to write in Korean predict multicultural acceptability. And for multicultural adolescents who are 14 years old and in the second grade of middle school, the ability of foreign mothers to listen to Korean language and the ability of multicultural teenagers to listen to Korean language acted as variables to predict the multicultural acceptance. Conclusion: It is not by foreign language proficiency that we embrace multiculturalism, but by the Korean language ability of multicultural adolescents and the Korean language proficiency of minority multicultural subjects (mother of multicultural families) that are the main influences in this study. However, these findings may be unique to Korea’s multicultural society, where marriage immigrants account for a majority, so there is caution in interpreting the results.",decision_tree_2020_academic_riss.csv

By the way, in Canada, there is also a constitutional interpretation methodology comparable to U.S. originalism and living constitution. This is the living tree doctrine that emerged in the interpretation of Canada’s Constitution. It was presented in an interpretation debate on the Persons of Article 24 of the British North America Act 1867. The issue was whether or not ‘Persons’ included ‘female persons’.In 1928, the Supreme Court of Canada decided that women were not eligible to be called for the Senate on the basis of the originalism. However, the Canadian Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which was Canada’s final trial at the time, ruled on the basis of the doctrine of the “living tree” that women were summoned to the Senate and deserved to become Senators.In 1929, the doctrine of living trees, which was presented as the basis for the interpretation of the constitution by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, opened a new horizon as a method of constitutional interpretation.It also suggested that the Constitution should not be interpreted narrowly from the perspective of the past, but should be interpreted in a reasonable and broad method in the present. In order to adapt to organic and changing environmental changes, the constitution had to be interpreted in a broad and free way. It was the origin of New Originalism presented in Canada’s constitutional interpretation. Recently, the living tree doctrine is also a reason to be re-focused as a method of interpreting the Constitution in response to changes in modern society. However, criticism has been raised against the doctrine of living trees.In particular, it is an interpretation method that ignores the intentions of the democratically elected government or the legislators, and it is an interpretation methodology that allows judges to make arbitrary decisions. As a result, the Supreme Court is criticized for being the subject of a third legislative or constitutional change. That is, the court is not finding a clear meaning in the legislator’s intentions or the text of the constitution, but is making judgments based on the judge’s own beliefs and political choices.In this study, I reviewed the judgment of the Supreme Court, which placed emphasis on legislator’s intention in interpreting Canada’s constitution. The so-called Edwards Case in 1928 is the subject of review and research. Based on what reason and background, did you judge that women are not included in the qualifications to be summoned to the Senate? I would like to analyze the originalism suggested by the Canadian Supreme Court in the interpretation of Persons.On the contrary, did the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council judged that the Persons of Article 24 of the Constitution of 1867 included women? In 1929, the Persons Case was the subject of analysis and research. On what basis did you judge that a woman could be summoned to the Senate and become a Senator? What is the living tree doctrine that made it possible? I tried to find the origin of Canadian New originalism in living tree theory.If so, how important is the living tree doctrine in constitutional interpretation?

These two words combined in to one set phrase because ‘Folktale of red bean’ and ‘Folktale of acacia tree’ is sharing same meaning of ‘Faithful love’ and ‘Everlasting love’, which makes two words relation equivalent in cultural implications. When two folktales spread ‘Folktale of acacia tree’ had more power in propagation and influence, people like to call ‘Hong dou tree’ as ‘Acacia tree’. Synonyms of the same tree went on. Name, underlying meaning of two trees are mixed used. In Tang dynasty Wang Wei’s poem ‘Lovesickness’ got famous for song structure, it played decisive role in creating ‘Hong dou xiang si’ set phrase. ‘Hong dou xiang si’ has two meaning structure, one is subject-predicate structure same as Wang Wei’s poem line. Meaning ‘Hong dou’ is best symbol of everlasting love. The other is ‘Hong dou’ and ‘Acacia tree’ has same cultural semantics which is love, friendship and lovesickness.

It is one of the fundamental principles of the tax law. The primary purpose of guaranteeing property rights of the people and stabilization of legal life. As another principle, the principle of substantial taxation refers to taxation based on real substance rather than form. Tax evasion cases, which are subject to taxation problems in Korea, are similarly problematic in Japan.And Article 81-4(1) of the Framework Act on National Taxes provides, “Any tax official shall conduct a tax investigation to the minimum extent necessary to realize appropriate and fair taxation and shall not abuse the right of tax investigation for any other purpose”. Objectivity, minimization, prohibition of abuse of authority, etc. ― as stipulated in the instant provision ― are requirements for due process in the conduct of tax investigations, which are legally effective in and of themselves when aimed at applying the principles of a constitutional state in the field of tax procedure law.Tax investigations, as a form of administrative investigation to effectuate a state’s taxation authority, are essential for the purpose of either collecting data for tax assessment or verifying accuracy in a reported tax return, and ultimately play a pivotal role in preventing tax evasion and ensuring faithful payment of taxes. Nonetheless, the fact that the prevalence of misuse of authority not only disrupts a taxpayer’s business activity and personal life and infringes his/her property right but also breeds distrust as to a tax authority’s fairness, consideration of the public interest, and integrity should not be overlooked.if a tax investigation was conducted not for a lawful purpose, i.e., collection of data for tax assessment or verification of accuracy in a reported tax return, but for an illegitimate purpose, not only is the said tax investigation deemed a grave violation of law but disposition of taxation based on the data collected therefrom is also considered unlawful.In particular, the issue of Prohibition of reinvestigation is getting more attention today. This is due to concerns about the infringement of taxpayers' rights due to the uncertainty of the regulation. Article 81-4(2) of the Framework Act on National Taxes provides, ""No tax officials shall re-investigate the same item of taxes and for the same taxable period, except in any of the following cases"". Specific reasons for the exception to the prohibition of reinvestigation are listed in subparagraphs 1 to 7. The above rule cites 'Where obvious evidence exists to admit a suspicion of tax evasion', 'Where faults are found in connection with at least two taxable periods' and 'Other cases prescribed by Presidential Decree, which are similar to subparagraphs 1 through 6' as an exception. The exception to this prohibition of reinvestigation needs to be interpreted rigorously, given its nature.However, it is necessary to introduce an exception law for the exclusion of illegal collection evidence in criminal proceedings for tax equity and tax justice. In the light of the recognition of exceptions in criminal proceedings, which are more concerned about human rights violations than tax investigations, it should be actively accepted in the tax proceedings.",decision_tree_2020_academic_riss.csv

With the tree of knowledge as the center, God conditions Adam to be a vicarious ruler who governs Eden, and Adam absolutizes God as the creator who grants him the authority and the means to rule. The tree of knowledge is at the core of the relationship between God and human beings, beyond simply the problem of knowledge derived from the tree’s name. Adam’s right understanding of the tree of knowledge is especially Milton’s core educational content about Adam. In this education of Adam, factors such as reason, free will and obedience can be verified in the process of securing the subjectivity by which Adam establishes himself as a true human being.In regard to Adam’s education, the important thing is that Adam should yearn for the presence of God himself and the Holy Being before making a decision not to eat the fruit of the forbidden tree. This is because the Divine Presence is the perfect signification of the tree of knowledge and the aggregate of all reference systems. The power to refuse the fruit of the tree of knowledge depends not on Adam’s effort but on the presence of God, and the initiative of whether or not to eat the fruit of this tree belongs to God, not Adam. In fact, God’s command not to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is not a law but an ethic, a matter not of coercion but of spontaneity. Man cannot be saved by the law and the efforts to obey it, but he can achieve everlasting and real life only by the presence and love of the Holy God. God alone can guide Adam on the path to life and salvation, the ultimate meaning of the tree, overcoming the temptations of the tree of knowledge and its superficial signs. In conclusion, the lessons that Adam must realize through the tree of knowledge come down to the question of who the Holy Being is and who Adam is, which is also the essence of Adam’s education on the tree of knowledge.",decision_tree_2020_academic_riss.csv

Consumer damage refers to physical harm and property damage suffered by consumers in the course of their trade and consumer life, and is a problem that can never disappear as long as each economic agent conducts economic activities for different purposes. Although times have changed a great deal, most of the policies for consumer safety are still business-oriented, and consumers are still often harmed by consumers or neglected by the deception of their operators. Moreover, the consumers of baby boomers are relatively weak in information, and it is hard to make rational decisions or choices on their own, causing damages in the entire consumer life. Therefore, in this study, we conducted an exploratory study on consumer damage centering on the consumers of baby boomers. This study utilizes the decision tree analysis technique, which is a method of analyzing the decision rules and classifying the groups of interest into several subgroups or performing predictions. The data used in this study were collected from the 2017 Consumption Life Indicators in Korea conducted by Korea Consumer Agency. The basic statistics were processed using SPSS 22.0 and XLminer was used to analyze decision trees.

Impact of logging operations on forest ecosystem in the Khantai mountain region and forest cover mapping,2020,"['Forest change', 'skyline', 'tractor', 'images', 'Mongolia']",,"Forests in Mongolia yield low productivity and are vulnerable to disturbances from drought, fire, pests, and illegal logging. Such forests can quickly lose their ecological balance. Logging activities in these areas are limited in monitoring and controls. This study assesses two different logging operations for their natural regeneration capacity by comparing the composition of the soil, soil organisms, physical and chemical properties, and forest cover change after the completion of logging operations. The logging operations were analyzed in two different regions, the Khartsai and Tariakhtai threshold in Selenge soum, Bulgan province. A skyline logging operation was undertaken on Khartsai threshold in 1983 and a tractor logging operation (clear-cutting) on Tariakhtai threshold in 1987. After the completion of the logging, the forests were naturally regenerated. In 2002, soil samples were collected and soil organisms and physical and chemical properties were examined. Satellites images were also used to evaluate forest cover changes after the end of the logging operations. Significant differences in the naturally regenerated tree species in the skyline logging, tractor logging, and natural forest areas were observed. Average tree ring growth was 0.9 mm in the skyline logging site, 0.6 mm in the tractor logging site, and 1.2 mm in the natural forest. Based on forest cover changes observed in satellite images, the density of naturally regenerated tree species in the natural forest area was higher than that in the skyline logging area. In contrast, the latter recorded a higher density than that in the tractor logging area. Therefore, processing of satellite images of forest cover changes with high-resolution data provides valuable information for the local forest community and helps decision-makers in their further actions.",decision_tree_2020_academic_riss.csv

Detecting biomarkers from microarray data using distributed correlation based gene selection,2020,['Feature selection\xa0· Information theory\xa0· Spearman’s correlation\xa0· DLBCL'],,"Background Over the past few decades, DNA microarray technology has emerged as a prevailing process for early identification of cancer subtypes. Several feature selection (FS) techniques have been widely applied for identifying cancer from microarray gene data but only very few studies have been conducted on distributing the feature selection process for detecting cancer subtypes. Objective Not all the gene expressions are needed in prediction, this research article objective is to select discriminative biomarkers by using distributed FS method which helps in accurately diagnosis of cancer subtype. Traditional feature selection techniques have several drawbacks like unrelated features that could perform well in terms of classification accuracy with a suitable subset of genes will be left out of the selection. Method To overcome the issue, in this paper a new filter-based method for gene selection is introduced which can select the highly relevant genes for distinguishing tissues from the gene expression dataset. In addition, it is used to compute the relation between gene–gene and gene–class and simultaneously identify subset of essential genes. Our method is tested on Diffuse Large B cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) dataset by using well-known classification techniques such as support vector machine, naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbor, and decision tree. Results Results on biological DLBCL dataset demonstrate that the proposed method provides promising tools for the prediction of cancer type, with the prediction accuracy of 97.62%, precision of 94.23%, sensitivity of 94.12%, F-measure of 90.12%, and ROC value of 99.75%. Conclusion The experimental results reveal the fact that the proposed method is significantly improved classification accuracy and execution time, compared to existing standard algorithms when applied to the non-partitioned dataset. Furthermore, the extracted genes are biologically sound and agree with the outcome of relevant biomedical studies.",decision_tree_2020_academic_riss.csv

The first method is to process the incomplete data by assigning the missing value with equal probability that the missing variable can have, and learn this data with the SVM. This technique ensures that the higher the frequency of missing for any variable, the higher the entropy so that it is not selected in the decision tree. This method is characterized by ignoring all remaining information in the missing variable and assigning a new value. On the other hand, the new method is to calculate the entropy probability from the remaining information except the missing value and use it as an estimate of the missing variable. In other words, using a lot of information that is not lost from incomplete learning data to recover some missing information and learn using deep learning. These two methods measure performance by selecting one variable in turn from the training data and iteratively comparing the results of different measurements with varying proportions of data lost in the variable.",decision_tree_2020_academic_riss.csv

The results of the study are as follows. First, the results of the four different methods targeting mid-sized basin units classified the same hillslope differently. The difference of distribution of the Summit, Backslope and Toeslope was noticeable in the upstream basin, on the other hand, the difference between Shoulder and Footslope distributions was large in the downstream basin. Second, since the ‘mountain top’ area of Forest Soil Digital Mapping is considered as a summit and shoulder in the Catena hillslope position, in these criteria, the Ucap results were the highest in comparison to summit and shoulder ratios within the ‘mountain top’ area. However, when we looked at the ratio of the corresponding hillslope to the entire Korean Peninsula, the ReeP method demonstrated the highest accuracy of the calculation classification. Third, the comparison with the channel network map of the Han River Flood Control Office was carried out with at the toeslope, which is formed along the river side. Although the SlgP method demonstrated the highest ratio of toeslope in the area of the channel network, the UcaP results showed the highest accuracy when considering the proportion of relevant hillslope for the entire Korean Peninsula. Fourth, a comparison with the soil erosion model results to explore how best to reflect the internal process of the landform among the four methods, showed that the UcaP method best reflects the flow of water and materials.

For data analysis, IBM SPSS 25.0 programs were used t-test and decision tree analysis was applied. As for decision tree analysis, CHAID(chi-square automatic interaction detection)algorithm was applied. For simple prediction model of decision making, depth was applied in 3 levels, and the standard of parent node 5 case and child node 3 case were applied for the minimum number of cases. To confirm the appropriateness of the estimated prediction model, the classification accuracy, the risk estimate, and the standard error were calculated. The results of this research are as follows. First, the winning and losing deciding factors of the Men’s singles matches were service, receive, scoring technique-under clear, and average rally. Among the four factors, service were identified as the most relevant variable. if the service is less than 8 points, the probability of being classified as a losing group is 100%, and if there are more than 13 points, the probability of being classified as a winning group is 100%. Second, the winning and losing deciding factors of the Women’s singles matches were service, receive, loss technique-hairpins, and other situation scores. Among the four factors, service were identified as the most relevant variable. if the service is less than 6 points, the probability of being classified as a losing group is 100%, and if there are more than 13 points, the probability of being classified as a winning group is 97.4%. The result of this study are expected to be useful for badminton players, the media, and fans as information to understand badminton singles and identify the deciding factors for winning or losing.",decision_tree_2020_academic_riss.csv

When we look at the expression of the FOMC statements at the time of policy change period we can understand that Fed has been communicating with markets through a change of word selection. However, there is a criticism that the method of analyzing the expression of the decision sentence through the context can be subjective and limited in qualitative analysis. In this paper, we evaluate the signaling effect of FOMC statements based on previous research. We analyze decision making characteristics from the viewpoint of text mining and try to predict future policy trend changes by capturing changes in expressions between statements. For this purpose, a decision tree and neural network models are used. As a result of the analysis, it can be judged that the discrepancy indicators between statements could be used to predict the policy change in the future and that the US Federal Reserve has systematically implemented policy signaling through the policy statements.",decision_tree_2020_academic_riss.csv

The quality of the developed QC method was evaluated through the application to the 3 years (2016.03-2019.02) of 290 stations visibility data. For qualitative and quantitative verification of the developed QC method, visibility and naked-eye data provided by the KMA and QC method of the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (NMI) were used. Firstly, if the sum of missing and abnormal data exceeds 10% of the total data, the corresponding point was removed. In the 2nd step, a temporal continuity test was performed under the assumption that the visibility changes continuously in time. In this process, the threshold was dynamically set considering the different temporal variability depending on the visibility. In the 3rd step, the spatial continuity test was performed under the assumption of spatial continuity for visibility. Finally, the 10-minute visibility data was calculated using weighted average method, considering that the accuracy of the visibility meter was inversely proportional to the visibility. As results, about 10% of the data were removed in the first step due to the large temporal-spatial variability of visibility. In addition, because the spatial variability was significant, especially around the fog area, the 3rd step was not applied. Through the quantitative verification results, it suggested that the QC method developed in this study can be used as a QC tool for visibility data.",decision_tree_2020_academic_riss.csv

In addition, it was difficult to predict sales using the sales patterns of the same product since fashion products were released as new products every year. Therefore, the forecasting model was proposed using sales patterns of related product attributes when attributes were considered descriptive variables. We classified sales patterns using K-means clustering in order to explain the relationship between sales patterns and product attributes along with creating a decision tree classifier using attributes as input and sales patterns as output. As a result, the sales patterns of T-shirts were clustered into six types that featured the characteristic shape of peak and slope.

It has been reported that FHP results in shoulder pain, neck ache, craniofacial pain, headache, or other adverse conditions. To prevent FHP, it is advised to consciously keep one’s head in an upright posture. This paper proposes a new FHP warning system, which can help a user maintain a good posture by signaling an alarm, when FHP is detected. The system consists of an FHP warning device, a measurement set, and a decision algorithm for FHP. Unlike previous studies and patents, the proposed system delivers the design that is comfortable for daily use (because it is not worn by a user) and highly accurate through the adaptation of an AI (Artificial Intelligence) algorithm. The warning device was created as a turtle doll, which neck and back is elongated and lighted by LEDs, respectively. The measurement set consists of a servo motor and two sensors that read the distances from the computer to the upper face and the chest with the angular displacement of the two parameters. To decide FHP, three popular AI algorithms that are relevant to the classification problem were considered and analyzed, namely the ANN (Artificial Neural Network), SVM (Support Vector Machine), and DT (Decision Tree). Measurement data were collected by 7 different users and 2 chairs with different heights for good posture and FHP scenarios. The test results of the trained algorithms yielded accuracy performances of 73.78%, 83.00%, and 86.26% for ANN, SVM, and DT, respectively. In this study, ANN’s poor performance due to various reasons (e.g., the small training sample size) was discussed.

Using decision tree analysis as an analytical approach, the study considered consumers’ demographical variables with cognitive attitude toward the ad. A total of 681 respondents were used for data analysis. From the results of the decision tree, demographical segments were identified in relation to high visit intention to the advertised hotel. The results from the four splits indicate that consumers with a high level of cognitive attitude toward the ad (Aad) were identified as indicating high intention to visit the hotel. In addition, consumers with a low educational level were identified as the segment showing a high level of cognitive Aad.

Does Early Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery Improve the Cost-Effectiveness of Renal Stone Management?,2020,"['Lithotripsy', 'urology', 'cost-benefit analysis', 'kidney calculi']",,"Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treatment with retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) versus repeated shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) in patients with renal calculi.Materials and Methods: The non-retreatment rates (NRRs) and their respective real-world costs for RIRS and SWL were derived through retrospective analysis of health insurance claims data from 2015 to 2017. Decision tree modeling was performed to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of RIRS. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the robustness of the results.Results: Analysis of the obtained data showed that NRRs of single SWL ranged from 46% to 56%, whereas NRRs of single RIRS ranged from 75% to 93%. Introducing RIRS early in the treatment sequence was observed to be favorable for the reduction of overall failure (overall NRR, 0.997) compared to the results of repeated SWL (overall NRR, 0.928). The implementation of decision tree modeling revealed that the cost per retreatment-avoided increased with the introduction of RIRS at an earlier time (first line, second line, third line, fourth line: 18640 USD, 10376 USD, 4294 USD, 3377 USD, respectively). Probabilistic modeling also indicated that the introduction of RIRS as the first line of treatment was least likely to be cost-effective, when compared to other options of introducing RIRS as the second, third, or fourth line of treatment.Conclusion: Performing RIRS as early as possible can be recommended for eligible patients to reduce the overall failure, even if it is not as cost-effective as performing RIRS later.",decision_tree_2020_academic_riss.csv
Magnetic Resonance-Based Texture Analysis Differentiating KRAS Mutation Status in Rectal Cancer,2020,"['Rectal neoplasms', 'Texture analysis', 'KRAS gene', 'Magnetic resonance imaging']",,"Purpose Mutation of the Kirsten Ras (KRAS) oncogene is present in 30%-40% of colorectal cancers and has prognostic significance in rectal cancer. In this study, we examined the ability of radiomics features extracted from T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images to differentiate between tumors with mutant KRAS and wild-type KRAS.Materials and Methods Sixty patients with primary rectal cancer (25 with mutant KRAS, 35 with wild-type KRAS) were retrospectively enrolled. Texture analysis was performed in all regions of interest on MR images, which were manually segmented by two independent radiologists. We identified potentially useful imaging features using the two-tailed t test and used them to build a discriminant model with a decision tree to estimate whether KRAS mutation had occurred.Results Three radiomic features were significantly associated with KRASmutational status (p < 0.05).The mean (and standard deviation) skewness with gradient filter value was significantly higher in the mutant KRAS group than in the wild-type group (2.04±0.94 vs. 1.59±0.69).Higher standard deviations for medium texture (SSF3 and SSF4) were able to differentiate mutant KRAS (139.81±44.19 and 267.12±89.75, respectively) and wild-type KRAS (114.55±29.30 and 224.78±62.20). The final decision tree comprised three decision nodes and four terminal nodes, two of which designated KRAS mutation. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the decision tree was 84%, 80%, and 81.7%, respectively.Conclusion Using MR-based texture analysis, we identified three imaging features that could differentiate mutant from wild-type KRAS. T2-weighted images could be used to predict KRAS mutation status preoperatively in patients with rectal cancer.",decision_tree_2020_academic_riss.csv

Their clinical manifestations have been described on the basis of a small number of case reports and are not specific. Objective: This study aimed to use computer-aided image analysis (CAIA) to compare the clinical features and parameters of inflammatory papular dermatoses of the face and to develop a formalized diagnostic algorithm based on the significant findings. Methods: The study included clinicopathologically confirmed inflammatory papular dermatoses of the face: 8 cases of eosinophilic pustular folliculitis (EPF), 13 of granulomatous periorificial dermatitis-lupus miliaris disseminatus faciei (GPD-LMDF) complex, 41 of granulomatous rosacea- papulopustular rosacea complex (GR-PPR) complex, and 4 of folliculitis. Clinical features were evaluated, and area density of papular lesions was quantitatively measured with CAIA. Based on these variables, we developed a predictive model for differential diagnosis using classification and regression tree analysis. Results: The EPF group showed lesion asymmetry and annular clusters of papules in all cases. The GPD-LMDF complex group had significantly higher periocular density. The GR-PPR complex group showed a higher area density of unilateral cheek papules and the highest total area density. According to the predictive model, 3 variables were used for differential diagnosis of the 4 disease groups, and each group was diagnosed with a predicted probability of 67%∼100%. Conclusion: We statistically confirmed the distinct clinical features of inflammatory papular dermatoses of the face and proposed a diagnostic algorithm for clinical diagnosis.

This study investigates the cost-effectiveness between anti-reflux surgery and medication, with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for GERD in Korea.MethodsWe used a decision tree and Markov model to obtain the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of the surgical and medical strategies. Our target cohort was the severe GERD patients aged 50 years old who required a continuous double dose of PPIs. The time horizon was 10 years and all estimates were discounted at 5% per year. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the anti-reflux surgery compared with medication with PPIs was calculated. Sensitivity analyses were performed on all relevant variables.ResultsThe cost-utility analysis indicated anti-reflux surgery was more cost-effective than medication among severe GERD patients over a 10- year period. The model predicted that the surgical strategy had a cost savings of $551 and the QALYs had a gain of 1.18 as compared with the medical strategy. The break-even point in costs of the anti-reflux surgery over the medication was estimated to be 9 years. Sensitivity analyses using the varying parameter assumptions demonstrated the robustness of the study results.ConclusionsThis study showed anti-reflux surgery was less expensive and more effective therapy over the PPI medication after 9 years of follow-up.

Aspect ratio, formed by the height of buildings and width of streets, and street orientation were selected as the geometric characteristics of USCs. PET at 1.5m height calculated by ENVI-met, the microclimate simulation software, was chosen to determine the parameter of thermal comfort. Using the decision tree analysis, USCs of the case study area were classified into 10 nodes according to the geometry and thermal perception of each USCs. In addition, PET by each node derived by segmentation was analyzed over time. As a result, thermal comfort was found to differ according to the shadow generation rate of the streets - the higher the shadow generation rate, the more comfortable the thermal environment. More specifically, first, the higher the aspect ratio is, the more thermal comfort is found. Second, the more parallel the street orientation is and according to the direction of sunlight, the less thermal comfort is determined. Third, the impact of street orientation is indicated clearly when the aspect ratio is between 1.471 to 2.209.

FAFS: A Fuzzy Association Feature Selection Method for Network Malicious Traffic Detection,2020,"['Network security', 'malicious traffic detection', 'association rules', 'fuzzy inference', 'feature selection']",,"Analyzing network traffic is the basis of dealing with network security issues. Most of the network security systems depend on the feature selection of network traffic data and the de-tection ability of malicious traffic in network can be improved by the correct method of feature selection. An FAFS method, which is short for Fuzzy Association Feature Selection method, is proposed in this paper for network malicious traffic detection. Association rules, which can reflect the relationship among different characteristic attributes of network traffic data, are mined by association analysis. The membership value of association rules are obtained by the calculation of fuzzy reasoning. The data features with the highest correlation intensity in network data sets are calculated by comparing the membership values in association rules. The dimension of data features are reduced and the detection ability of malicious traffic detection algorithm in network is improved by FAFS method. To verify the effect of malicious traffic feature selection by FAFS method, FAFS method is used to select data features of different dataset in this paper. Then, K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm, C4.5 Decision Tree algorithm and Naïve Bayes algorithm are used to test on the dataset above. Moreover, FAFS method is also compared with classical feature selection methods. The analysis of experimental results show that the precision and recall rate of malicious traffic detection in the network can be signifi-cantly improved by FAFS method, which provides a valuable reference for the establishment of network security system.",decision_tree_2020_academic_riss.csv

This type of network ranges from various military and civilian applications. FANET is formed by micro and macro UAVs. Among many other problems, there are two main issues in FANET. Limited energy and high mobility of FANET nodes effect the flight time and routing directly. Clustering is a remedy to handle these types of problems. In this paper, an efficient clustering technique is proposed to handle routing and energy problems. Transmission range of FANET nodes is dynamically tuned accordingly as per their operational requirement. By optimizing the transmission range packet loss ratio (PLR) is minimized and link quality is improved which leads towards reduced energy consumption. To elect optimal cluster heads (CHs) based on their fitness we use k-means. Selection of optimal CHs reduce the routing overhead and improves energy consumption.

The physiognomy was an objective and practical tool to read the ability and possibility of the other party using the face as a text in our traditional culture. Reading the information on the faces through the physiognomy was also a means of enhancing communication with others and understanding the opponents. The physiognomy analysis of Korean faces can be cultural literacy in this context.This study was based on the faces of “Beyond The Scene (BTS),” which is popular worldwide with outstanding talent in performance and singing. They had the genetic traits of the Korean people who could become world-class stars and their unique genetic traits passed on to the faces of Korea were analyzed through physiognomy. Most of the human genetic traits are determined by biological genetics and are not easily changed. As there are differences in personal appearance, ability, and taste, individuality exists according to differences in ethnic traits. The BTS is the most successful Korean wave content in recent years. The effect of BTS has already attracted attention as an object of academic research, beyond the phenomenon of pop-culture. The potential traits of Korean people were mediated by the physiognomy of BTS and analyzed as possible cultural content.Based on this, the present study examined the aspect of cultural literacy inherent in Koreans as cultural content in the 21st century. Therefore, the study aimed to understand physiognomy as cultural literacy in modern times by examining the physical characteristics of genetic traits of “BTS” as successful cultural content from a physiognomical point of view.The members of BTS have a harmonious nose and cheekbone, and the eyebrows are good; therefore, their communication with fans using media has a positive effect. Their five sense organs are good in terms of physiognomy. Their faces are clear and they look like precious children. The skin of all members is smooth and clean. Their eyebrows are especially good. They are not too dark and they are arranged neatly and located high above the eyes. If people’s eyebrows are cool like this, they are popular with the public. The BTS is composed of great members who are musically good at composing songs, members who have excellent singing skills, and members who are excellent at dancing. Although there is a lack of individual physiognomic characteristics, when the members of BTS are together, they complement each other to make it more popular.This study recognizes that the accumulated method of reading faces according to socio-cultural conditions is a part of traditional culture as a cultural context.Furthermore, physiognomical reading can be cultural literacy that reads culture.This also means that the unique genetic traits on the face can be understood as a cultural text.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv
제조업의 인적오류 관련 사고분석을 위한 HFACS-K의 개발 및 사례연구,2020,"['HFACS', 'HFACS-K', 'accident analysis', 'acident investigation', 'human error']",,"As Korean government and safety-related organizations make continuous efforts to reduce the number of industrial accidents, accident rate has steadily declined since 2010, thereby recording 0.48% in 2017. However, the number of fatalities due to industrial accidents was 1,987 in 2017, which means that more efforts should be made to reduce the number of industrial accidents. As an essential activity for enhancing the system safety, accident analysis can be effectively used for reducing the number of industrial accidents. Accident analysis aims to understand the process of an accident scenario and to identify the plausible causes of the accident. Accident analysis offers useful information for developing measures for preventing the recurrence of an accident or its similar accidents. However, it seems that the current practice of accident analysis in Korean manufacturing companies takes a simplistic accident model, which is based on a linear and deterministic cause-effect relation. Considering the actual complexities underlying accidents, this would be problematic; it could be more significant in the case of human error-related accidents. Accordingly, it is necessary to use a more elaborated accident model for addressing the complexity and nature of human-error related accidents more systematically. Regarding this, HFACS(Human Factors Analysis and Classification System) can be a viable accident analysis method. It is based on the Swiss cheese model and offers a range of causal factors of a human error-related accident, some of which can be judged as the plausible causes of an accident. HFACS has been widely used in several work domains(e.g. aviation and rail industry) and can be effectively used in Korean industries. However, as HFACS was originally developed in aviation industry, the taxonomy of causal factors may not be easily applied to accidents in Korean industries, particularly manufacturing companies. In addition, the typical characteristics of Korean industries need to be reflected as well. With this issue in mind, we developed HFACS-K as a method for analyzing accidents happening in Korean industries. This paper reports the process of developing HFACS-K, the structure and contents of HFACS-K, and a case study for demonstrating its usefulness.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv
Placement of Charging Infrastructures for EVs using K-Mean Algorithm and its Validation using Real Usage Data,2020,['Electric vehicle · Charging infrastructure · Charging station · Eco-friendly vehicle · Jeju island'],,"Global climate change is affecting human life more seriously than ever before. Countries around the world have identified cars as a significant source of pollution, leading to an increased interest in eco-friendly automobiles. Electric vehicles (EVs), which are characteristically eco-friendly, have become a choice for future transportation system. In this paper, we proposed a strategy for determining the appropriate placement of large-scale charging stations using K-mean algorithm. Also, the initial results were validated utilizing actual electricity usage data from the existing chargers. Currently in Korea, a typical public charging station has two to three chargers to support EV users. As EVs become more popular, new problems arise, such as charger hopping and/or long waiting lines. In order to address these new issues, a large-scale charging station concept which houses more than ten chargers, is suggested. In doing so, a strategic approach for selecting close-to-ideal locations for the charging stations is introduced to maximize the charging station’s effectiveness. In this study, Jeju Island, Korea, which has many EVs, was used as a testbed. With the wealth of EV chargers and their usage data, initial validation of the proposed methodology was made possible. During the evaluation of the best possible locations for the largescale charging stations, we considered the locations of tourist attractions and convenient support facilities, as well as the population. After the evaluations, the proposed locations were validated using actual long-term charger usage data on Jeju Island. The demonstrated strategy for identifying appropriate locations for large-scale charging stations can be used by other tourist heavy islands or even small countries.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

We also verified whether the introduction of K－IFRS would allow managers to use discretionary recognition on the feasibility of deferred corporate tax assets as a means of earnings management. The research sample is the year of 3,089 non－financial firms that were listed on the Korea Stock Exchange in December from 2008 to 2016.  The empirical analysis results are as follows. First, it was shown that the managers’ discretionary recognition level on the feasibility of deferred corporate tax assets has increased since the introduction of K－IFRS. Second, since the introduction of K－IFRS, managers’ discretionary recognition level on the feasibility of deferred corporate tax assets has been utilized in earnings management for the purpose of avoiding earing reduction compared to the prior year. Further analysis also showed that since the introduction of K－IFRS, managers’ discretionary recognition level on the feasibility of deferred tax corporate assets has been utilized in earnings management for income smoothing purposes. Therefore, this study suggest that discretionary recognition criteria for the feasibility of deferred corporate tax assets that have been relieved since the introduction of K－IFRS are likely to be used as a means of earnings management. Therefore, it is deemed necessary to respond to this by the government authorities and to pay attention to participants in the capital market.

According to Chesterton, the core of the Christian Orthodox is not a dry dogma or a fixed entity. For Chesterton, Christian orthodoxy is a superhuman paradox whereby two opposite passions may blaze. According to Chesterton, imagination does not breed insanity. On the contrary, reckless emphasis upon reason breeds insanity. The insane person who has lost everything except his reason can not accept a superhuman paradox.  We emphasize that Chesterton does not regard the cosmos as a closed system. Chesterton interprets human history in terms of narrative where genuine miracles can happen. The most wondrous miracle of human history is the incarnation and death and resurrection of Christ. Owing to this miracle, we are invited to the glorious adventure of God.

On the other hand, by mixing with other types of materials, the fabrication of relatively large nanotubes would be feasible in the case of macroscale applications. In the current article, a nonlinear finite element formulation is employed to deal with the nonlocal vibrational behavior of carbon/boron-nitride nano-hetero-tubes in the presence of magneto-thermal environment. Euler–Bernoulli beam model in conjunction with the Eringen’s nonlocal theory of elasticity is adopted to derive the governing equation of motion. In order to conduct a nonlinear frequency analysis, the von-K´arm´an nonlinearity associated with moderate rotations is also considered. It is well known that temperature gradients can significantly change the dynamic behavior of nanotubes. On the other hand, the coefficients of thermal expansions of carbon and boron-nitride nanotubes are quite different that may affect the structural stability of hybrid nanotubes. Hence, to explore the vibration characteristic of such composite structures, the influence of magneto-thermal environment is also taken into account.

The existing SF of the K-WAIS-IV (Choi et al, 2014), when used to the subnormal group, overestimated the IQ of the subnormal group because of regression toward mean. Also, the existing SF’s subscales were not enough to measure fluid reasoning (Gf) component. To address these problems, this study suggests three new SFs: SF A, SF B, and SF C. SF A (including VC, AR, MR, and CD) and SF B (VC, AR) were developed based on the confirmation factor analysis (CFA) result of draft examination sample (n=474). SF C (AR, MR), with theoretical and practical reasoning that evaluation of Gf would be useful in draft examination, includes arithmetic reasoning (AR) and matrix reasoning (MR). A multiple regression analysis was performed to derive a regression formula equation to estimate IQ. All three SFs met all validity criteria (Resnick & entin, 1971) with the exception of concordance rate. In an additional study conducted to examine utility of the new SFs as a screening test, SF A showed a very high screening ability. SF B and SF C also showed a decent screening ability. Interestingly, SF C was shown to be better than SF B in selecting out those who need an additional in-depth examination. The ROC results indicated that SF A, SF B, and SF C are all secondary screening test.

With BTS and its fandom ARMY as a main case study, we try to identify who the feminist fans are and what makes their fan practice critical to K-Pop industry and our society.  Selecting six (former/current) BTS ARMYs who claim themselves as feminist fans, we conducted semi-structured interviews in terms of their feminist fan experience on misogynistic lyrics and controversial attitude of BTS after 2016.  By analyzing the research participants’ narratives of feminist fan practice, we found that “declaring leaving K-Pop fandom” has crucial meaning to feminist fans. Four common experiences have been examined: (1) identifying him/herself as both fan and feminist, (2) practicing feminism in their fandom group, (3) self-conflict between two different identities, (4) (considering leaving or) leaving fandom as a feminist fan statement. We also discovered that they considered “leaving fandom” as the strongest political/public statement as a fan, a K-Pop consumer, as well as a feminist.   While the emergence and practice of feminist fans have its own importance, it obviously did not succeed in expanding its implications to either K-Pop idol scene or Korean feminist movement. It also fails to fracture dominant structural tendency to neglect feminist perspective in K-Pop idol industry or culture which considers human being as a major capital or a product.  Despite these limitations, we argue that exodus of feminist fans from K-Pop fandom allows a critical question to current misogynic K-Pop idol scene, and K-Pop industry in general: “is feminism really unnecessary to K-Pop idol scene?”  We expect this study to bring attention to changes in K-pop and its fandom under the growing influence of feminism. Furthermore, it can shed new light on how the relation between Korean popular culture and Korean feminist public will evolve.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

Many modeling groups participating in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP) have been working towards multi-model ensemble approach that have become a standard technique for projecting future climate and for assessing associated uncertainties to deal with intrinsic shortcomings of climate models. Within this context, the National Institute of Meteorological Sciences/Korea Meteorological Administration (NIMS/KMA) has developed the KMA Advanced Community Earth-system model (K-ACE) under KMA-Met Office collaboration for climate research. This paper provides general descriptions of the first generation K-ACE model including the coupling strategy, as well as preliminary evaluations of the model performance in mean climate fields. The first generation K-ACE model appears to capture the mean climatology and the inter-annual variability of the observed climate. Horizontal distributions and the variability of the surface and pressure-level variables agree well with observations with correlation coefficients of 0.88–0.99 and 0.69–0.99, respectively. Measured in terms of performance index between the observed and simulated fields, the K-ACE performance is comparable with those of 29 CMIP5 models. This study also identifies key weaknesses of the KACE in the present-day climate. Improving these deficiencies will be a topic of future studies.

To analyze the meaning of personal experiences, I used a phenomenological approach by using not only in-depth interviews but also an online survey with global participants to enhance the reliability of the research results.Results : Phenomenological factor analysis of sustaining CBE has resulted in two categories; One is music as an element for developing differentiated and qualified brand and the other is social influences of the brand as a key element for a sustaining relationship. Excellent quality of music along with empathetic lyrics and performance were derived as theme clusters. The second category, brand’s influences, comes up with inspiring, personality, sincerity and communication as theme clusters. In comparison with the establishing factors of CBE, the percentage of the social influences of the brand, which can be said to be the intrinsic nature of brands and the social value, have increased very much.Conclusions : Brand management as the platform of social meaning and value creation is the prerequisite of the sustainability of the brand. Therefore, creative and future-oriented branding that leads a new paradigm should be a sincere platform for urging consumers to act voluntarily in the form of a verb with a present progressive form.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

The dictionary meaning of ākāra is shape, image, and so on but it has various Chinese translated words such as 行相, 取相, 相 etc. Among them 行相 a tranalated word of 玄奘, implies that 行 is the role of subject and 相 is the role of object. in the case of Sarvāstivādin, it can be seen that role of subject in the definition of 有行相(sākāra). In the case of Sautrāntika 行相 is the main basis for recognition. On the other hand, According to 成唯識論 the subjective 行相 and the object 行相 appesrs on the vijñāna fron vijñāna. The subjective 行相 is 見分 and the objective 行相 is 相分. 行相 of 見分 is defind 了別(vijñapti). 行相 of 見分 can be 了別(vijñapti) 行相 of 相分. 了別(vijñapti) is not the subjectivity knowing the object, but appearing like a 行相 on the vijñāna. All is only manifested as a 行相 from the vijñāna. Therefore, there is no external object only what appears(vijñapti, 了別) to exist. After the term 行相(ākāra) reveals the clues of the subjective role in the Sarvāstivādin, it has established itself as a basis for recognition in the Sautrāntika and settled as a concept that has a more complete from terms and in the content in the Yogācāra.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

The aim of the study was to evaluate low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction in 53 patients suffering from polygenic hypercholesterolemia, characterized by a low/intermediate cardiovascular risk calculated with SCORE algorithm. The effects on lipid profile of 2-month treatment with NUT containing MonK+KA (1:1), BBR, and sylimarin, were compared with Atorvastatin (ATO) 10 mg administrated in a matched control group. Serum proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) levels and the cholesterol loading capacity (CLC) were determined at baseline and at the end of the study in NUT-treated group; variations were assessed. NUT was effective as lipid-lowering agent with a wide interindividual response variability (mean LDL-C from 170.8 ± 19.9 to 123.8 ± 20.0 with a change of −47.0 ± 21.5 mg/dL; P < .001) and the effect was similar to that induced by ATO. The use of NUT significantly modified PCSK9 levels (P < .01) and CLC (P < .001), ultimately suppressing the serum-mediated foam cell generation directly measured on human macrophages.

Understanding Human Suffering and Jesus Prayer (Matthew 6:9-13) -In View of Asian Yangdanjõk (兩端的) Wisdom in Epistemology,2020,"['Jesus Prayer', 'Christianity', 'Human Suffering', 'Yangdanjok Wisdom', 'Asian Religions', 'Subject-Object Discrimination', 'Emptiness and Dependent Origination', '4 Levels of Prayer Practice', '예수기도문', '기독교', '인간고통', '양단적(兩端的) 지혜', '아시아 종교', '주객분리', '공(空)과 연기(緣起)', '4단계 기도']","본고는 예수께서 기도문(주기도문)을 통해 과연 인간고통의 문제를 어떻게 다루는지 살피기 위해, 유대 지혜전승 뿐만 아니라 아시아 종교의 인식론적 지혜를 활용한다. 해석학적으로 기독교는 기존의 가치들을 좀 더 강화하고 활성화하기 위하여, 많은 부분들을 다른 종교들이 가지는 깨달음과 빛에 비추어 볼 필요가 있다. 왜냐하면 공통의 인류 사회 속에서 그것들 또한 많은 사람들에 의해 지지를 받고 있어서, 결코 간과해서는 안되기 때문이다. 본고는 그러한 과정을 통하여 단순히 기독교 예배의 폐회를 위한 장식용으로 잠자고 있던 상투적인 기도문이 아니라, 사실상 예수 그리스도의 엄청난 통찰력과 신학적 창조성이 있음을 발견하게 된다. 주객 분리적이며 이원론적인 서구적 사고가 아니라, “하늘에서처럼 땅에서도”라는 구절의 통사론적 해석을 통해 드러나듯이, 개인이 아니라 개인을 포함한 전체, 하늘만이 아니라 땅까지 포함한 전체로서의 포함(包含)을 말한다. 예수의 복음적 관심이 매우 우주적이며 통전적임을 드러낸 것이다. 그러한 지혜는 Q와 마태복음 안에서 예수기도문의 정확한 배경과 상황을 이해할 수 있도록 촉구함으로써, 순회설교자들의 공동체와 이후의 신앙공동체가 당면하였던 도무지 납득할 수 없었던 문제와 고통을 중심으로 당시 사회문화적으로 이해될 수 있는 적실한 방식으로 해결방안을 찾을 수 있도록 도와준다. 전도서와 다니엘 그리고 나아가 쿰란 공동체가 발전시킨 지혜뿐만 아니라, 아시아인들의 인식론에 깊이 자리하고 있던 아시아적 고유의 지혜체계는 결국 인간고통의 문제를 인식하거나 해결하는 과정을 매우 색다르게 접근하도록 돕는다. 아시아의 인식론은 우주의 연속성과 더불어, 그 안에서 서로 연결되어 끊임없이 창조되고 순환하는 세계에 대하여 직각(直覺)하는 특징을 갖는다. 놀랍게도 예수 역시 이미 산상수훈에서 풍부하게 드러나고 있듯이 불가지한 삶의 고통에 대하여 다소간 현실체계에 완전히 동화(同化) 되면서도 동시에 신앙적 동질성을 유지하는 양단적 지혜를 이미 활용하였다. 물론 이후의 기독교는 서구철학을 내면화하고 정식화하면서 이러한 예수의 독특한, 매우 아시아적이고 양단적인, 해석학을 상실하거나 희석해 버렸다. 결국 예수기도문은 고통 가운데 있는 인간들이 궁극적 진리를 확정하려고 벌이는 신앙적 관심과 노력에 한계가 있음을 암시하면서도 그러한 고통이 의미없는 허상인 것처럼 치부해버리지는 않는다. 오히려 자신의 고통을 짊어진 채 자신의 문제를 넘어 공동체의 고통을 나누고 해결하기 위해 함께 연대하는 삶을 살도록 한다. 아시아적 지혜를 고찰하면서, 연구자는 예수기도문을 보편적인 기도와 묵상의 방편으로 삼아, 그 속에서 성령-지혜-능력-평화의 4단계 실천적, 수행적 패턴을 제시한다.","Referring to Asian epistemology, this work explores how Asian wisdom shed a tremendous light on Christian understanding of Jesus Prayer, pertinent to Jesus’ response to the problem of human suffering. Through formulating a reasonable contingency, Jesus Prayer at that time, still standing in the flux of Jewish wisdom tradition, appears to provide the frustrated faith community as well as his perturbed disciples with wisdom of assimilation and integration in society. This exploration prompts Christians to utilize their commitment and enrich many dimensions of truth among themselves by openness to deep insights and lights of others which cannot be neglected. It may involve a serious risk of confusion in Christian identity, but surely will be helpful for its fertilization. The yangdanjõk perspective, surely found in Jesus Prayer, tells the wisdom of how to deal with and solve desperate problems of human suffering, although which it would be soon blurred and lost in the following Western philosophical dualism. Never comprehensible by illusory conceptualization, even theological formulation, which is deconstructed and nullified as meaningless by Jesus, the reality in and of itself shows what it has ever been as it is. It is not different from the recurring message of wisdom: Just “fear of the Lord” by emptiness and union with him, in solidarity with the suffering communities. This yangdanjõk (兩端的) wisdom, similar to the wisdom teaching in Asian Religions, “Sanggubori hahwajungsaeng” (上求菩提 下化衆生), is tantamount to an urge to live in the undifferentiated continuum. Hence for proper rendering of yangdanjõk meaning of Jesus Prayer into English or Korean, the adverbial clause (i.e., “As in Heaven, also on earth”) may need to relocate just before the first Thou petition (i..e, “Hallowed be your name”), in which the Prayer clearly exposes Jesus’ ultimate concern dovetailed heaven and earth. Jesus Prayer was not tailoring a platform for theological, conceptual and logical formulation to deliver individuals, but rather show Jesus’ followers, more probably as his personal experience did, a practical wisdom to save the entirety, engaging in solidarity with suffering people, still maintaining the faith of fearing God. In order to fully internalize the power and significance of Jesus Prayer, a yangdanjõk contemplating practice in the four levels, i.e., Spirit, Wisdom, Power, and Peace, is suggested.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv
"Early Experience, Setup, Learning Curve, Benefits, and Complications Associated with Exoscope and Three-Dimensional 4K Hybrid Digital Visualizations in Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery",2020,"['Exoscope', 'Minimally invasive spine surgery']",,"Study Design: Prospective observational study (n=74).Purpose: To evaluate the learning curve for exoscope and three-dimensional (3D) 4K hybrid visualization in terms of operating time, advantages, disadvantages, and surgical complications in tubular-access minimally invasive spine surgery (MISS) and to assess surgeon satisfaction with image quality, ergonomics, and ability to perform target site treatment.Overview of Literature: Working through tubular retractors poses a challenge. The extreme angulations during microsurgical decompression, especially contralateral decompression, require surgeons to work non-ergonomically. An exoscope allows surgeons to work ergonomically and independently of the microscope oculars as visualizations are now provided by large 3D 4K monitors. However, the value and efficacy of solely depending on an exoscope and 3D 4K monitors during microsurgical work are still unknown.Methods: Seventy-four patients (99 levels) underwent trans-tubular MISS between March 2018 and January 2019. Five patients were excluded: one had pyogenic discitis, two had revisions, and two were trans-tubular transoral. In total, we analyzed 69 for operating time, blood loss, and complications. The learning curve graph was plotted using the surgical time for each procedure. Surgeons were asked to rate their satisfaction with image quality, ability to maintain ergonomic posture, and efficient target site treatment.Results: For tubular microdiscectomy, the operating time plateaued after six cases, and for tubular decompression and minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion, the operating time plateaued after nine cases. Mean operating time was significantly reduced after the plateau. Complications included four cases of dural tear. All patients improved symptomatically, and there were no postoperative neurological deficits.Conclusions: Use of the exoscope has a short learning curve. Surgeons benefit from improved ergonomic posture during surgery, and resident teaching appears to be good. The only drawback is the need to rearrange the operating table setup. Complications were comparable to those when using the surgical microscope. An exoscope with hybrid digital visualization provides excellent visualization, depth perception, clarity, and precision target site treatment.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

Preaching is distinguished by its nature from what those acts of communication have with its divine, spiritual and faithful aspects. Thus, the practical task of preaching should be integrated to the theological task. The purpose of this study is to make a theological statement honestly and clearly about ambiguous realities of practicing the task of preaching. The ambiguous realities consist of the ambiguity of preaching between human word and God’s word, uncertain understandings of God’s word that is not identified with preaching, but also witnessed to by it, and complex riddle of faith confessing that “preaching is God’s word” on me and us. Accordingly, this study purposes to find out a coherent theological statement on those subjects and present useful directions, at a more profound level, for talks and practice of preaching. For this goal, the dogmatics on God’s word of Karl Barth would give me helpful guide and direction for searching for the answer to what I am asking to. The subjects of Barth’s dogmatics on which this study focuses are the dual tension of preaching, the three-fold revelation and its identification and dis-identification with God’s word, identity of God’s word, and the word of God as a coming word and eventful-ness of preaching. Above all, the word of God as a ‘coming word,’ which is related to the more essential and intricate questions, tries to answer to two questions that follow: one is “What is God’s word that is not only distinguished from words of preaching, but is also revealed through them by God?” The other is “What does it mean for preaching to be God’s word for us, which is not God’s, and how do we sense it and how do we identify and state it theologically?” In conclusion, this study is, through the dialogue with Barth’s dogmatics on God’s word, to examine theological answers to the questions on realities of preaching and, based on this examination, to propose subjects that should be dealt with in homiletic talks and practice of preaching.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

"BMD42-2910, a Novel Benzoxazole Derivative, Shows a Potent Anti-prion Activity and Prolongs the Mean Survival in an Animal Model of Prion Disease",2020,"['Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy', 'Prion protein', 'Anti-prion', 'Derivatives', 'In silico']",,"Prion diseases are a group of neurodegenerative and fatal central nervous system disorders. The pathogenic mechanism involves the conversion of cellular prion protein (PrPC ) to an altered scrapie isoform (PrPSc), which accumulates in amyloid deposits in the brain. However, no therapeutic drugs have demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials. We previously reported that BMD42-29, a synthetic compound discovered in silico, is a novel anti-prion compound that inhibits the conversion of PrPC to protease K (PK)-resistant PrPSc fragments (PrPres). In the present study, 14 derivatives of BMD42-29 were obtained from BMD42-29 by modifying in the side chain by in silico feedback, with the aim to determine whether they improve anti-prion activity. These derivatives were assessed in a PrPSc-infected cell model and some derivatives were further tested using real timequaking induced conversion (RT-QuIC). Among them, BMD42-2910 showed high anti-prion activity at low concentrations in vitro and also no toxic effects in a mouse model. Interestingly, abundant PrPres was reduced in brains of mice infected with prion strain when treated with BMD42- 2910, and the mice survived longer than control mice and even that treated with BMD42-29. Finally, high binding affinity was predicted in the virtual binding sites (Asn159, Gln 160, Lys194, and Glu196) when PrPC was combined with BMD-42-2910. Our findings showed that BMD42-2910 sufficiently reduces PrPres generation in vitro and in vivo and may be a promising novel anti-prion compound.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

Rapid identification of the wildfire damages is also important for establishing forest restoration, budget planning, and human resources allocation. Because the wildfires need to be examined for vast areas, satellite remote sensing has been adopted as an effective method. Many studies for the detection of wildfires and the analysis of burn severity have been conducted using mid- and high-resolution images. However, they had difficulties in the sensitivity problem of NBR (Normalized Burn Ratio) for multi-temporal images. This paper describes the feasibility of the detection and classification of wildfire burn severity using Sentinel-2 images with K-means and ISODATA (Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Techniques Algorithm) methods for a case of the Andong fire in April 2020. The result can be a reference to the appropriate classification of large-scale wildfire severity and decision-making for forest restoration planning.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv
Application of the covariance matrix clustering algorithm for partitioning joint sets having various joint pole sizes and densities,2020,"['Joint sets delineation', 'clustering analysis', 'K-means algorithm', 'equal-size problem']",,"An analysis of data collected on rock discontinuities mostly requires the data to be separated into sets. An automatic clustering algorithm that assists in identification of joint sets is always desired. Several algorithms have been proposed, most of which are based on the widely used fuzzy K-means method in which the optimization step involves minimizing the sum of squared distances between objects and the centroids of clusters. Empirical studies have demonstrated that this method tends to generate equally sized clusters, which means clusters of different sizes cannot be adequately distinguished (equal-size problem). This paper introduces the application of a clustering method that applies an optimization criterion based on the estimated covariance matrix to overcome the aforementioned equal-size problem of the K-means clustering scheme. The applicability of the method is demonstrated using both artificial and field data with low dimensionality.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

In the first K-means clustering, three direct employment effects clusters and three new employment effects clusters were classified into nine employment effect clusters. Afterwards, ANCOVA with control variables was used to determine whether there was a significant difference in employment effects among clusters under the control of age of the company and size of firms.  In particular, ten industrial technologies show high employment effects in both the start-up and non-start-up business groups, and five of them belong to ICT. Therefore, we confirmed the possibility of driving job creation through investment and support for the technology.

Lossless Compression for Hyperspectral Images based on Adaptive Band Selection and Adaptive Predictor Selection,2020,"['hyperspectral image lossless compression', 'conventional recursive least squares', 'k-means clustering', 'adaptive band selection', 'adaptive predictor selection']",,"With the wide application of hyperspectral images, it becomes more and more important to compress hyperspectral images. Conventional recursive least squares (CRLS) algorithm has great potentiality in lossless compression for hyperspectral images. The prediction accuracy of CRLS is closely related to the correlations between the reference bands and the current band, and the similarity between pixels in prediction context. According to this characteristic, we present an improved CRLS with adaptive band selection and adaptive predictor selection (CRLS-ABS-APS). Firstly, a spectral vector correlation coefficient-based k-means clustering algorithm is employed to generate clustering map. Afterwards, an adaptive band selection strategy based on inter-spectral correlation coefficient is adopted to select the reference bands for each band. Then, an adaptive predictor selection strategy based on clustering map is adopted to select the optimal CRLS predictor for each pixel. In addition, a double snake scan mode is used to further improve the similarity of prediction context, and a recursive average estimation method is used to accelerate the local average calculation. Finally, the prediction residuals are entropy encoded by arithmetic encoder. Experiments on the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) 2006 data set show that the CRLS-ABS-APS achieves average bit rates of 3.28 bpp, 5.55 bpp and 2.39 bpp on the three subsets, respectively. The results indicate that the CRLS-ABS-APS effectively improves the compression effect with lower computation complexity, and outperforms to the current state-of-the-art methods.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

Researchers have solved production planning and scheduling problems by the sequential method. But, in this case, the solution obtained by the production planning problem may not be feasible for scheduling method. Hence, production planning and scheduling problems must be solved simultaneously. Therefore, in this work, a mathematical model is developed to integrate production planning and scheduling problems. The solution to this integrated planning and scheduling problem is attempted by using a discrete artificial bee colony (DABC) algorithm. To speed up the DABC algorithm, a k-means clustering algorithm is used in the initial population generation phase. This k-means clustering algorithm will help to converge the algorithm in lesser time. A real-life case study of a soap manufacturing industry is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. An objective function to minimize overall cost, which comprises the processing cost, material cost, utility cost, and changeover cost, is considered.

In this paper, we review spectral clustering and show important issues in spectral clustering such as determining the number of clusters K, estimation of scale parameter in the adjacency of two points, and the dimension reduction technique in clustering high-dimensional data.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv
몸의 움직임에 주목하는 교양교육의 의미,2020,"['교양교육', '예술적 추상화 과정', '상징 형식', '몸의 움직임 수업', '몸의 정체성', 'liberal education', 'abstraction in art', 'symbolic form', 'body-movement in liberal education', 'identity of body']",,"This article considers a way of understanding of the relationship between oneself, others, and the world that is centered on the sensibility, emotions, and sensitivity of the body, which have not received much attention in the tradition of liberal arts education, agreeing with the responsibility of having to cultivate integrated and universal ability of the learners of liberal arts education. To this end, a philosopher Susan K. Langer’s concepts of the ‘symbol’ and the ‘abstract process’ are considered to be concepts upon which these liberal arts education classes can be grounded. Langer defines the symbolic form of arts as an expression of human’s inner life and an output of mental function that can be seen by objectifying the essence of human emotions. I think the key process that makes this possible is in the unique abstraction process in arts, and this is because Langer’s concepts can be considered to be an appropriate foundation for constructing the meaning of arts and the process itself. Specifically, this process of the abstraction can be understood as a deductive reasoning through which the abstract concepts are derived from general ideas. However, in the field of arts, it can be understood as a process of calculating the logical form that grasps the organic relation between the whole and the partial even though it is invisible; eventually, this is a kind of logic that can help us develop an ability to look at our lives intuitively and syntagmatically.This article aims to assert that this ability is a universal competency that our age demands. In order to develop these ideas more specifically and to understand them vividly, I observed the characteristics of the artistic process by observing and interviewing the actual liberal arts class which focuses on the movement on the body. Henceforth, I believe there will be various educational meanings that can be derived from this process of formation of our body identity.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

Ryu, who laid the foundation in Korean criminal law, presented several very original thoughts in his criminal law theory. This article focuses on ‘the theory of symbolic criminal law’ (symbolische Strafrechtslehre) among them. The theory of symbolic criminal law was an original theory that Professor Paul K. Ryu devoted his life to, but it was not properly illuminated in Korean academic world. This is regrettable given the academic level and performance that the theory of symbolic criminal law is reaching. Even from this point of view, the theory of symbolic criminal law provides several theoretical and practical implications. In this consciousness of the problem, this article analyzes the theory of symbolic criminal law from the standpoint of a criminal law philosophy. In particular, it examines what philosophical theory the theory of symbolic criminal law is based on, and how the theory of symbolic criminal laws developed in Prof. Paul K. Ryu’s criminal law theory, and what it contains in detail. According to the analysis of this article, the theory of symbolic criminal law embraced the philosophy and theory of Whitehead, Northrop, and Whorf. From Whitehead, the theory of symbolic criminal law accepted the theory of language as a symbol, the theory of pluralistic concepts from Northrop, and the principle of linguistic relativity from Whorf. Accordingly, the theory of symbolic criminal law emphasizes that the language constituting the criminal law norms is a symbol. The symbolic language and its target form a relative and multidimensional relationship rather than an absolute relationship. In other words, the language constituting the criminal law norms is multi-dimensional, multi-contextual in its structural, relative and instrumental dimensions. In the linguistic concept prescribed by the criminal law, its meaning is constructed in three dimensions according to which temporal, vertical and relational structures, in what legal areas, and for what legal purposes. Prof. Paul K. Ryu developed this theory of symbolic criminal law into a general theory of criminal law. The theory of symbolic criminal law is a multidimensional general theory. It covers a wide range from the images of human being to criminal law dogmatics. At the same time, the theory of symbolic criminal law integrates criminal policy and criminal dogmatics, like Franz von Liszt and Claus Roxin. Of course, at the same time, the constitutional spirit and the free society are emphasized as the limit of this teleological criminal dogmatics proposed by the theory of symbolic criminal law. This theory of symbolic criminal law also has practical implications as follows. The fact that the criminal system is never a complete system, and that constructing criminal law dogmatics should focus on teleological thinking.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

This means that as the related party transaction increases, the cost of capital, such as the cost of debt, equity, and weighted average capital, increases. In addition, as a result of analyzing the effect of related party transactions of related party transactions on upper and lower groups on capital costs, related party transactions of related party transaction subgroups pay attention to capital costs such as debt capital costs, equity capital costs, and weighted average capital costs. It was found to have a negative(－) effect. On the other hand, it was found that the related party transactions of the related group of the related group had a significant positive effect on capital costs such as the cost of debt, equity capital, and weighted average capital cost.[Implications] It is significant that the information asymmetry increases due to transactions between related parties, and as a result, the cost of capital increases as the risk to the company increases.

A total of 509 YO birds were used for this study. Genetic diversity and population structure analysis were conducted based on the MS marker genotype information. The overall average polymorphic information content value and expected heterozygosity of the population were 0.586, and 0.642, respectively. The K-mean cluster analysis based on the genetic distance result confirmed that the current YO population can be divided into three ancestry groups.

As a result, the study found that the character ‘cha’ officially appeared in the book Cha Jing (The Classic of Tea) as a reference to the concept of tea for the first time, based on records from Pronunciation and Meaning of Kaiyuan Characters. Moreover, ‘cha’ was used to represent the sound of the Siddhamātṛkā-character ‘ḍha’ in Buddhist scriptures even before it was first written in Cha Jing. The Siddam character ‘ḍha’ represents a complete state of vimokṣa and nirvāṇa, catva‘rismrtyupastha’na (four foundations of mindfulness), the practice of upāya in Esoteric Buddhism, and the practices of śamatha and vipaśyanā in Mahāyāna Buddhism in major Buddhist scriptures. It can be estimated that ‘cha’ may have led to current reading sounds in Korean, which makes the Chinese character ‘cha’ selectively pronounced as ‘dha’ or ‘cha’. According to Jineonjip (Mantras) in Korean, the reading sound of the Chinese character ‘cha’ was listed as ‘dha’ in Korean. This may have led to the current reading sound rule of ‘charye’ being occasionally called ‘darye’.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

In these works, Dick presents the religious visions of “Mercerism” and “Ubik” for human salvation in the post-apocalyptic entropy world. Based on empathy, Mercerism dissolves the rigid thinking of traditional religion that emphasizes the extreme confrontation between good and evil and it represents the ability to declare one’s own salvation through communal sharing of experiences. In addition, the possibility of salvation is presented through “Ubik” confirmed by Logos. Dick shows us that divinity can be found not only in holy churches and sanctuaries, but also in surroundings and everyday life.

Space‑Vector‑Based Hybrid PWM for Zero‑Sequence‑Circulating‑Current RMS and Common Mode Voltage Reduction in Two Parallel Interleaved Two‑Level Converters,2020,['Paralleled interleaved three-phase inverter · Zero-sequence-circulating current (ZSCC) · Root mean square (RMS) · Common mode voltage (CMV) · Hybrid space vector modulation (HBSVM)'],,"This paper aims at reducing the root mean square (RMS) values of the zero-sequence circulating current (ZSCC). The analysis reveals that the ZSCC is determined by the duty ratios of the medium voltage vector and zero vector. Whereas the reference voltage fxes the duty ratio of the medium vector, the duty ratio of the zero-voltage vector depends on the distribution of the small and larger vectors, which can be used to optimize the ZSCC. As such, we propose a generalized PWM architecture, where the distribution of the active vectors is parameterized by a coefcient k. Based on this, we derive regions for k that attain the same minimal ZSCC peak. Within these regions, we further optimize k to minimize the ZSCC RMS. Depending on the reference voltage, the method selects diferent coefcient k for the ZSCC RMS optimizations. The proposed modulation strategy is therefore a HBSVM due to its adaptive feature in the distribution of the active vectors. The proposed HBSVM uniformly applies to the entire vector plane and is computationally afordable for mainstream microcontrollers. Finally, the experimental results validate the merits of the proposed method.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

The mean flow field including velocity profiles and the dominant frequency of flow oscillation that was from the simulations discussed earlier were compared with the experimental data observed by Wang et al. (2004; 2006). Based on these comparisons it was found that the v2-f model is most accurate for the URANS simulation; moreover, the k-ω model is also acceptable. However, the k-ε model was found to be unsuitable in this case. Therefore, v2-f model is proved to be an excellent choice for the analysis of flow with massive separation.

The issue is where the foundation of their formal structure is. For the solution to this, researchers focus on two views. One is the view that the Pauline Epistles are based on ancient letter writing. The other is one that they are base on rhetorical form.In this paper I support that the formal structure of the Pauline Epistles is within the category of rhetoric. That they are within the category of rhetoric means that Paul wrote his letters as the speeches. Therefore, they follow rhetorical rules. The basis that they can be regarded as a category of rhetoric lies in the speeches they were sent to the group/the community in. When we compare ancient letters written on papyri with the Pauline Epistles, this fact become much more apparent. Ancient letters are for an individual or a few persons whereas a subject of the Pauline Epistles is the group/the community, which evinces the fact that they belong to rhetorical category.The basis that they are in rhetorical category is found through rhetorical evidence. That they are for brothers, verbal speeches, and have equal authority with speaking makes sure that the Pauline Epistles are in rhetorical category.Buddhist kōan as a Girardian simulation of crisis can be compared with stichomythia in Greek tragedy as verbal contests. For Girard, if the art of Greek tragedy is to be defined in a single phrase, we might call attention to one of its most characteristic traits: the opposition of symmetrical elements. There is no aspect of the plot, form, or language of a tragedy in which this symmetrical pattern does not recur. The core of the drama is that the two protagonists exchange insults and accusations with increasing earnestness and rapidity. The Greek public is brought to these “verbal contests.” The symmetry of the tragic dialogue is perfectly mirrored by the stichomythia, in which the two protagonists address one another in alternating lines. Stichomythia is particularly well suited to sections of dramatic dialogue where two characters are in violent dispute. The rhythmic intensity of the alternating lines combined with quick, biting ripostes in the dialogue can be quite powerful. In tragic dialogue hot words, as Girard puts it, are substituted for cold steel. But whether the violence is physical or verbal, the suspense remains the same. The adversaries match blow for blow, and they seem so evenly matched that it is impossible to predict the outcome of the battle.The agonistic or conflictual nature of verbal contest is a typical element of the Buddhist kōan. Kōan as a kind of verbal contest can be understood as a simulacrum of crisis within the context of Buddhist initiation. The agonistic or conflictual nature of Chan dialogues, sometimes called Dharma battles,has often been pointed out, but it is usually downplayed as a ‘skillful means’ used by master to test and awaken his disciple. Clearly, this interpretation, for Faure, cannot simply be taked for granted in the case of those masters whom Linji called “blind shavepates and wild foxes.” Quite possibly, many of them were symbolically, socially, or psychologically empowered by their (symmetrical) confrontations with novices. This encounter produces a winner and a loser; and the gain and the loss are very real: like the ‘deadly words’ of witchcraft, the dialogue seems to activate quasi-magical forces. Mon-dō(question-answer)is verbal battle(Wortgefecht)between master and disciple.But this violent, agonistic or conflictual nature of Chan dialogues, language game was sometimes misunderstood in the sense of playful quality of language. These violent methods of linguistic simulation of the sacrificial crisis within the context of Buddhist initiation are to be understood as representing a (initiatory) play of differentiation and undifferentiation in Girardian sense. For Girard, great theater is necessarily “a play of differentiation and undifferentiation.” Buddhist (no)-theater and ritual process of (initiatory) meditation can be also considered in this sense. Girard subordinates play to religion, and in particular to the sacrificial crisis. Play has a religious origin, to be sure, for Girard, insofar as it reproduces certain aspects of the sacrificial crisis.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

In the ‘old Tokyo before new Tokyo’, ‘new Tokyo’ means the great Tokyo which was transformed into the metropolis. The stage of ‘For Half a Year’ is Tokyo before such transformation. For considering such division, it is required to thoroughly read the space in the novel on the basis of history, culture and geology of Tokyo. With critical mind on it, this paper carefully examined the space in the novel by Park, Tae-won related to Tokyo using the map before 1930s. It aims to understand the map of Park, Tae-won’s awareness on Tokyo on the basis of the relation between spaces in each novel. As a result, it was found that Park, Tae-won were not indulged only into the center of ideology led by Tokyo, the capital city of Japanese empire. In such tug-of-war, Park, Tae-won focused on the dark world in Tokyo, the periphery in Tokyo. The dark world means Sumida river area in Three-day Starving Spring Moon and The Miserable and Tokyo apartment in Travail. Through the dark world, he showed the space for life of the lower classes in Tokyo. As paying attention to the peripheral space not the mainstream place of institutional ideology, he could draw the differentiated Tokyo. His interest on the suburbs was originated from that dark world. Denying and dismissing the center of Tokyo enabled to pay attention to suburbs. Bangranjang, the cafe in Koenji, was created by the spirit of denial on the center of Tokyo. While it’s the place in imagination, it’s meaningful on the aspect that it’s the different space raising the question on the center of Tokyo. Park, Tae-won said that he felt overwhelmed by Hongo where there was Daiichi High School and Imperial University when he arrived in Japan for the first time. But he was not ultimately intimidated by keeping a certain distance from such space. Through the center concept, this paper secured the viewpoints of Park, Tae-won on Tokyo as the artist. It’s the result from his sense of identity as the writer or artist that he could imagine the spaces in suburbs out of the center and the dark side of the city. While he was the artist in the colony, he was ultimately the artist. His novels related to Tokyo indicate his position as described above.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

These results can be interpreted that the auditor is strategically setting the audit cost for the continuous audit business contract for a large business group that has a great influence on the Korean economy when the auditing contract is concluded.The greater the intrinsic risk of an entity, the more likely the auditor will be to spend more audit time and increase audit fees. In particular, a high stake ratio means that there is a high degree of agency problem between the controlling shareholder and the minority shareholder.

Sajasangsung(師資相承) is a way of designating successor of Dharma transmission between a teacher and a disciple in Buddhism. It has been the way of traditional designating of successor in Korean Buddhism.  In the Zen master lineage, the objects of this study are the ‘secret transmission’ (密嗣) of Hyujǔng(休靜) and ‘Dharma Teaching in dream’(夢中法門) of Hyobong (曉峰). In the Ordination master lineage, the object of this article is Sǒsangsugye (瑞祥受戒) of Daeǔnnango(大隱朗旿) and Kǔmdambomyǒng (金潭普明). In the Buddhist Scripture Teaching master lineage, Wupaekundang(位牌建幢, becoming the disciple of the teacher who was passed away in front of the mortuary tablet) of Myungsǒng is chosen for this study.  Although Hyobong is the successor of the Taegobowu(太古普愚) lineage, after getting Dharma teaching in his dream, he asserted he would be the successor of Jinǔl’s lineage and his thought would follow Jǒnghyessangsu(定慧雙修). Kǔmdambomyǒng was the teacher of Daeǔnnango, but he volunteered to be the successor of his disciple Daeǔnnango after experiencing Sǒsangsugye that had happened to Daeǔnnango. Myungsǒng became the successor of Suok in front of her memorial tablet.  The reason that I focus on the way of bridging the gap is that it may make us reinterpret the tradition creatively. Especially I figured out that the attitude of self-determination played the important role in the process of bridging.  I am interested in this attitude, self-determination and finding creative ways of recovering the lineage. Because it can give us an inspiration.

It is well known that this flow is naturally unstable due to the Karman vortex shedding and exhibits a complex flow structure in the wake region. The mean flow field including velocity profiles and the dominant frequency of flow oscillation that was from the simulations discussed earlier were compared with the experimental data observed by Wang et al. (2004; 2006). Based on these comparisons it was found that the v2-f model is most accurate for the URANS simulation; moreover, the k-ω model is also acceptable. However, the k-ε model was found to be unsuitable in this case. Therefore, v2-f model is proved to be an excellent choice for the analysis of flow with massive separation.

Looking at the Paragon of Rules on Conduct, Paekp’a is greatly disheartened by the collapse of the traditional Buddhist monk aqueduct consciousness at the time and the confusion of the denomination resulting from this, and seeks to improve this confusion through the ten wholesome precepts accompanied by true repentance. It is believed that the ten wholesome precepts can promote the inner improvement of the monks in that it is a system that can control the defilements of the bodily actions, speech, and thought, especially the ‘thought 意’. Originally, as Four Part Vinaya 四分律, it is the traditional method to receive bhikṣu ordination, so it is argued that it is not in accordance with the aquatic tradition that only the ten wholesome precepts can be received. However, Paekp’a has given important meaning to the ten wholesome precepts by faithfully following the traditions such as the Yogâcāra precepts and Jinpyo 眞表’s repentance practice, which have had a great influence on the commandment tradition of Korean Buddhism. In addition, from the standpoint of the determination of self-purity, the ten wholesome precepts is positioned within the three categories of pure precepts 三聚淨戒, so that the monks naturally grasp the pure nature of their own, so that they naturally leave evil and develop the good, and furthermore, they take an independent position to provide relief for rebirth.

A total of 340 junior and senior students from universities completed a questionnaire including Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (K-IUS-14), Career Barrier Inventory (KCBI), Job-seeking anxiety scale, Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ) and demographic variables. After excluding incomplete questionnaires, a total of 300 surveys were used for the data analysis. The results were as follows. First, positive correlations were examined among intolerance of uncertainty, job-seeking anxiety and perceived career barrier, whereas meaning of life was negatively correlated with perceived career barrier. Perceived career barrier appeared to have partial mediation effect on relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and job-seeking anxiety. Third, meaning of life was determined to regulate the effect of perceived career barrier on job-seeking anxiety. Forth, it was concluded that, by using perceived career barrier as a medium parameter, the moderated mediation effect is significant as meaning of life adjusts intolerance of uncertainty and job-seeking anxiety.

Forming part of the Ancient School (rnying ma), Dzogchen boasts a contemplative system in which practices are said to be effortless and liberation consists solely in the revelation of our already perfected Buddha-nature. This contribution focuses on controversial ideas such as this, and explores their origin, their place within the world of Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, and their underlying mode of functioning. As for the origin of the Dzogchen teachings, this paper argues that they must be located in two collective traumas that affected the founders of the Ancient School during the tradition’s formative years, namely the collapse of the Tibetan empire (ninth century CE) and the marginalization suffered after the rise of the New Schools (gsar ma) in the subsequent centuries. As for the tradition’s position within the religious landscape of the Himalayas, it should not only be explored in relationship to other “crisis cults,” such as the Kālacakra Tantra that emerged during the advent of Muslim rule in India, but also to the treasure tradition (gter ma). Finally, this study explores the key underlying functioning of the doctrine of effortless enlightenment by means of the concept of the “ground” (gzhi / sa), which is central to both Dzogchen and Terma. Reading the Dzogchen myth of the “epiphany of the ground” side by side with accounts of how “earth treasures” (sa gter) are unearthed out of the Tibetan soil, the paper shows that the ground was fundamental to the success of Nyingmapa Buddhism. By allowing its adherents to infuse the present with past energy, the repetition of old narratives with innovative meanings, and the attitude of receptivity with agency, the mythicalhistorical ground of the Ancient School is not only a means to overcome its collective traumas, but also laid the foundation for the teaching of effortless enlightenment that marks the tradition until today.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

The Jungwon Goguryeo Stele(중원고구려비), which is relatively more characteristic of the Idu writing system, offers a glimpse of the potential existence of the Hundok reading system without nonetheless providing any conclusive evidence. The passage on Goguryeo’s place names in the Volume 37 of secondary source Samguk sagi gives two equivalent names, ‘鉛 (lead): 乃勿 [na-mɨl]’ and ‘城 (castle): 忽 [hol]’, for the castle situated on the north bank of Amnokgang(Yalu river). On the basis of this equivalence, it can be conjectured that the Hundok reading system existed in Goguryeo prior to the 7th century. General Yeon Gaesomun, written ‘淵蓋蘇文’ in Hanja, is transliterated by ‘伊梨柯須彌’ [iri kasumi] in Nihon Shoki. This means that the Hundok reading system was used in 7th-century Goguryeo, which was then marked by the activities of General Yeon Gaesomun. However, the inscription on the Gwanggaeto Stele(광개토대왕비문) shows a good command of Chinese characters as early as the beginning of the 4th century, which seems to suggest that the Hundok system might have already existed in Goguryeo at that time. Nonetheless, clear evidence has yet to be found in the materials of that period.Based on the historical data on Baekje, the existence of the Hundok reading system is suggested by the name ‘猪耳’ (pig’s ears) inscribed on a wooden tablet excavated from the Buyeo Neungsanri Temple site(부여능산리사지목간), which is estimated to date back to early 6th century. From the native Baekje translation of ‘猪耳’, that is, [toskui/tothkui] (돗귀/돝귀), it can be supposed that the Hundok reading system existed in early 6th-century Baekje. Citing Baekje Sinchan (百濟新撰), which is a book on the history of Baekje, secondary source Nihon Shoki mentions that King Muryeong(462~523) was named ‘斯麻’[sima] because he was born on an island and ‘斯麻’ could be written ‘嶋君’(island-born man) in Hanja. The equivalence between the Hanja character ‘嶋’(island) and the Baekje word ‘斯麻’ shows evidence for the use of Hundok. It can be concluded from this example that the Hundok reading system existed from King Muryeong’s reign (i.e. 6th century) onwards.Among the historical data for Silla, we can mention ‘波珎’[*patɔr](海) inscribed on the 6th-century epigraphs of the Uljoo Cheonjeon-ri Second Inscription(울주천전리추명, 525) and the Danyang Jeokseong Stele(단양적성비, 540), wherein the character ‘珍’ can be read as [tɔr](* 돌). The equivalence between ‘石(stone): 珍[tɔr]: 突[tor]’ which appears in Baekje’s place names also proves that ‘珍’ was read as [tɔr]. While it is certain that ‘珍’ was read as [tɔr/tΛr](돌/□), more evidence is required to prove that it is indeed a Hundok reading. The inscriptions ‘文作人’ and ‘文尺’ on the Tag-Gu Musul Ojak Stele(대구 무술오작비) and the Namsan Sinseong Stele(남산신성비) respectively might have been read as [kɨlja(h)](글자(ㅎ)), but this remains inconclusive. However, the coexistence of the inscriptions ‘韓舍’ [hansa] and ‘韓奈麻’ [hannama] on the 8th-century Gilt Bronze Reliquary of the Hwangboksa Pagoda(황복사석탑금동사리함명, 706), as well as that of ‘大舍’[dεsa] and ‘韓舍’ [hansa] on the Hwaeom-gyeong Copy(화엄경사경조성기, 755) constitute compelling evidence that ‘大’ was read [han] (한). Thus, it can be confirmed that the Hundok system had existed in Silla from early 8th century or just before it. The character ‘白’ from the 7th-century Wooden Tablet no.149 of Wolseong Moat(월성해자목간149호) may have been read according to the Hundok reading system but it is also correct to understand it according to the original meaning of this Hanja, i.e. [saroida](사뢰다, to tell honorific). The character ‘在’ [kjə], however, was written according to the Idu script and, therefore, can be seen as a Hundok character. Although SamgukYusa remains a secondary source material, it is recorded that Won-hyo(617~686) was designated by his contemporaries with the Silla name ‘始旦’(seol 설), which shows that the Hundok reading system existed in mid-7th-century Silla.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

Qualitative decline is a problem for the curriculum. It is a low-cost tuition and consists of about 8 to 15 lessons per step. Compared to the calligraphy curriculum, the calligraphy curriculum is poor. It is often the case that classes are omitted without basic font features and theories. In this curriculum, the process of repeating the qualifications of those who got the certificate as an educator was repeated. Such a process is causing a decline in calligraphy, which causes a decline in the quality of calligraphy. Calligraphy s institutional method of education has led to similar calligraphy work, and the side effects of loss of uniqueness by mass production of works that do not meet the concepts of calligraphy and loss of uniqueness by those who do not master the basics of calligraphy.

Under the cultural phenomena of hallyu (popularity of Korean pop culture), there have been more opportunities to introduce Korean culture to the world. Accordingly, there has been a necessity to have traditional Korean nail art in the K-beauty industry as well. To reduce the closeness of the ‘full coat’ and maintain the retention of gel nail, this study proposed space nail art. In addition, this study tried to establish theoretical grounds through related books, literature records and various web sites to analyze space nail, which as yet has not been greatly studied. This study is also aimed to propose differentiated nail art in customers’ aesthetic needs and the unlimited possibility in the development of nail art materials.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

K-IFRS “Fair value measurement” prioritizes the source of information used in fair value measurements into three levels: (1) Level 1 (observable inputs from quoted prices in active markets), (2) Level 2 (indirectly observable inputs form quoted prices of comparable items in active markets identical items in inactive markets, or other market-related information), and (3) Level 3 (unobservable, firm-generated inputs). K-IFRS requires fair value assets and liabilities to be disclosed by these levels. When there are no observable market prices entity estimates fair value using a valuation method(Level 3 inputs), the auditor is required to exert additional effort to understand management's rationale for selecting the method, whether the method is appropriate, whether the method is applied consistently. In this situation, the period from the end of the accounting period to audit report date(audit report lag) would increase because auditor collects sufficient audit evidence to reduce the audit risk.This study conducts empirical analysis using listed companies from 2014 to 2018, and the results are as follows. First, the proportions of fair value assets using level 3 inputs are positively associated with audit report lag (closing day of fiscal year∼audit report day). This result means that auditor considers the opaqueness of financial assets measured at Level 3, and invests more time and effort to the audit procedure. Second, audit report lag is shorter for firms with long auditor tenure especially Level 3 fair values. This results highlight the importance of auditor tenure in mitigating intrinsic measurement error associated with Level 3 inputs. Third, Level 3 fair values are positively related to audit fees and audit hours. Fourth, Level 3 fair values are positively associated with the realization rate of audit engagements. This result suggests that auditor receives higher risk premium for client with more Level 3 fair values, which leads to a higher profitability from the audit engagement.This study makes an important contribution in that it is the first study to examine the effect of fair value hierarchy information on audit report lag. Also this paper extends prior studies on audit fees and audit hours by focusing on the measurement of audit profitability, a realization rate.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

One of the clues of the forgery is its writing style. Unlike other works of Jingying Huiyuan, the Jingyingshu contains unpolished sentences throughout the text. However, I argue that it is not so much a question since the early version of Jingying Huiyuan’s writings shows the same problem as well.2) The Jingyingshu interprets the term Kāya-traya thorugh the classification of the Ti(體), Xiang(相) and Yong(用). These three terms are identified with the Dharmakāya, the Saṃbhogakāya and the Nirmāṇakāya respectively. This way of interpretation is the original scheme of the Dilun School.3) The Jingyingshu quotes his another writing “The Meaning of the Two Hindrances(二障義)” in almost full length when explaining the defilement theory of the Awakening the Mahāyāna Faith. The previous research asserted that this quotation shows no consistency and pointed it as the decisive evidence of the apocryphalness of the Jingyingshu. However, as far as I can see, the Jingyingshu choose the most relevant analytics on the matter.In conclusion, the Jingyingshu can be regarded as a commentary written under the doctrinal influence of the Jingying Huiyan, if not composed by himself.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

Founded by Gerd B. Achenbach in 1981, today’s philosophical counseling inherits the traditional philosophical counseling. In the philosophical counseling, the philosophy itself is considered a therapeutic discourse for the disease of the soul. The object of philosophical counseling as doing philosophy is to cure for the soul. In particular, K. Jaspers and V. Frankl are pioneers in the field of philosophical counseling that treats the philosophical disease as disease of the mind in a modern point of view in accordance with traditions of ancient philosophers. Jaspers’ elucidation of existence and Frankl’s elucidation of meaning are attempt to overcome limitations of the psychoanalysis in Freud and the traditional psychotherapy. The elucidation of existence and the elucidation of meaning effectively focus on the existential anthropology in high-level psychology in order to go beyond Freud’s deep psychology. The elucidation of existence is not only to let a client who is facing a borderline situation or an existential stranding of his or her life approach his or her existence, but also to encourage a client to reveal the original existence by elucidating his or her existence in a free choice. On the other hand, the elucidation of meaning is to help a client who is suffering from the existential vacuum due to frustration or meaninglessness or loss of meaning by elucidating the meaning of his or her own life. In this regard, the philosophical counseling is a philosophical practice led by a philosophical counselor to overcome the problem of mental suffering by elucidating a client’s his or her existence or meaning of life. In particular, Frankl’s elucidation of meaning is based on the elucidation of existence invented by Jaspers, so if these two elucidations work in complementary ways, they will serve as an exemplary example for modern people’s mental suffering, namely, the existential stranding(Jaspers) or the existential vacuum(Frankl) in the horizon of philosophical counseling.

Accordingly, this study analyzes empirically whether provision for bad debt may realize correctly on future credit risk. Non performing loan ratio(NPL) at absolute level as well as NPL gap which means the difference between NPL ratio on average and real NPL ratio are used as the proxy variable of future credit risk. Main results are as follows. First, real provision to required provision for bad debt does not recognize the future credit risk because the level of NPL or the NPL gap is negative or positive to future credit risk, respectively. These results are line with the arguments of Cohen and Edwards(2017), Simper, Dadoukis, and Bryce(2019). Second, it is found that the relationship between market interest rate and future credit risk is positive. The possibility of uprising future credit risk is low in that repayment capacity of borrower may be increased under low interest rate trend. As a result, reasonable adjustment of provision is required because recognition of future credit risk level is overestimated. As Kim(2017) and Lee(2019) are argued that adequacy of provision in Korean banks is required, the standard on setting up provision in credit card firm should be reconsidered.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

For this study, pretest－posttest was conducted using the ‘Management Wisdom’ measurement tool developed by the researcher, and the analysis and verification were conducted using SPSS 25.[Findings] As a result, all factors resulted in statistically significant results. In other words, the SSWB model can be interpreted as improving the level of management wisdom. Therefore, it has been verified that this is a useful program for learning the wisdom of managers.[Implications] This study is significant in that the research related to learning wisdom has been limited to qualitative research through interview or through ideological reasoning so far, while actual quantitative measurement has been attempted. Moreover, the significance of the program can be found in the fact that the researchers who have conceptualized the wisdom of managers and developed measurement tools and programs for the first time in Korea have personally verified the effectiveness of the program. This means that the direction and flow of research are consistent, as well as the context of the same subject can be brought together to be faithful to the exact nature of the study. Also, the possibility of learning wisdom has been justified.

In order to achieve the research purpose, 245 pre-service early childhood teacher attending the 3 and 4-year college programs in D and K regions were included as subjects to metaphorically express and explain the reasons. According to the analysis, play was divided into three categories: ‘the essence of play’, ‘the nature of play’, and ‘the function of play’. ‘The essence of play’ was categorized as ‘the play of life’, ‘the nature of play’ as ‘playing as fun and happiness,’ ‘playing as a free choice’, ‘playing as a variety’, ‘playing as a diverse’, and ‘playing as a immersion’. As for ‘the function of play,’ it was categorized as ‘playing as a study method’, ‘playing as a growth environment’, ‘playing as a teaching environment’, ‘playing as a cure’, and ‘playing as a potential development’. Based on the results of this study, it is worthwhile in that this study implicates the needs for pre-service early childhood teacher education not only to positively form their beliefs and values about play, but also to understand and cultivate their play, and furthermore, this study provides basic materials for teacher education.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

X-선 회절실험으로 VO2 박막은 결정성이 우수함을 알 수 있었고표면형상 측정으로 표면 거칠기가 0.58 nm – 1.08 nm 정도임을 확인하였다. VO2 박막은 약 325 – 350 K 사이에서 금속-부도체 상전이를 보였다. 그리고 스퍼터링 (DC sputtering) 방법을 이용하여 VO2 박막 위에 수직 자기이방성을 갖는 Co/Pt 다층박막을 제작하고 자기-광 커 효과 측정을 통하여 Co/Pt 박막은 뚜렷한 수직 자기이방성을 가짐을 확인하였다. 구조적 상전이를 함에도 불구하고 (100) VO2 는평면 내에서 두 격자상수의 변형 효과가 상쇄되는 경향을 갖기 때문에 (100) VO2 와 결합된 Co/Pt 박막의보자력은 VO2 와 결합되지 않은 Co/Pt 박막과 비슷한 형태의 온도 의존성을 보였다. 반면, (101) VO2 는 이웃한 Co/Pt 박막에 알짜 경계면 변형력을 제공하기 때문에 자기탄성효과에 의해 보자력이 증가된 것으로 생각된다. 보자력은 자화용이축 방향으로 구조적 상전이 온도 근처에서 최대 약 5 Oe, 자화어려움축방향으로 약 200 Oe 정도 증가되는 것으로 보였다.","Fifty-nanometer thick (100) and (101) VO2 films were synthesized on C-plane and R-plane Al2O3 substrates using pulsed laser deposition. X-ray diffraction measurements suggested that the VO2 films with a root-mean-square roughness of 0.58 – 1.08 nm had good crystalline properties. The temperature dependence of the resistance for the VO2 films displayed a metal-insulator transition behavior at TMI= 325 – 350 K. Co/Pt multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy were deposited on (100) and (101) VO2 film by using DC sputtering, and their magnetic properties were monitored by using magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements. Although the VO2 has a structural transition from monoclinic to tetragonal at the TMI, the (100) VO2 plane seems to have opposite changes in the two in-plane lattice constants, so no net strain is induced in the neighboring Co/Pt film. On the other hand, the (101) VO2 with net changes in both in-plane lattice constants at the TMI presumably provides interfacial stress to the neighboring Co/Pt film thus, it induces a net magnetoelastic effect, which results in an increases in the coercive fields of 5 Oe along the easy axis and 200 Oe along the hard axis.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to derive subgroups of patients who experienced similar patterns of sleep-related problems and nocturnal disabilities.Results The total K-PDSS-2 score was 11.67±9.87 (mean±standard deviation) at baseline and 12.61±11.17 at the retest. Cronbach’s α coefficients of the total K-PDSS-2 scores at baseline and follow-up were 0.851 and 0.880, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficients over the 2-week study period ranged from 0.672 to 0.848. The total K-PDSS-2 score was strongly correlated with health-related quality of life measures and other corresponding nonmotor scales.LCA revealed three distinct subtypes of sleep disturbance in the study patients: “less-troubled sleepers,” “PD-related nocturnal difficulties,” and “disturbed sleepers.” Conclusions K-PDSS-2 showed good clinimetric attributes in accordance with previous studies that employed the original version of the PDSS-2, therefore confirming the cross-cultural usefulness of the scale. This study has further documented the first application of an LCA approach for identifying subtypes of sleep disturbance in patients with PD.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv
Development of Microsatellite Markers Using Next-Generation Sequencing and Genetic Characterization in Three Natural Monument Populations of Koelreuteria paniculata (Goldenrain Tree),2020,"['genetic diversity', 'genetic structure', 'individual identification', 'ornamental tree', 'simple sequence repeat']",,"This study was conducted to develop microsatellite markers in Koelreuteria paniculata using next-generation sequencing. A total of 71,114,562 reads of 20x coverage for the K. paniculata genome were generated and assembled to 141,924 contigs of a minimum of 500 bp long. One hundred seventy-nine of the 79,633 contigs containing microsatellite regions were used for primer design. Fourteen primer sets were selected as polymorphic markers by applying them to three K. paniculata populations, designated as natural monuments in Korea. Somewhat low levels of genetic diversity were observed. The grand means of the number of alleles, observed heterozygosity, and expected heterozygosity were 2.7, 0.493, and 0.407, respectively. Analysis of molecular variance indicated a high level of genetic differentiation among populations. Distinct patterns of three populations were identified in the principal coordinate analysis and Bayesian structure analysis. The probability of identity of these markers was estimated to be quite low, suggesting that these markers have the robust potential power to distinguish genetically different individuals. K. paniculata has a high economic value as an ornamental tree, and a honey tree. The novel microsatellite markers developed in this study will be useful for future breeding programs and genetic studies aimed at developing conservation plans.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

In all instances, market capitalization consistently fell below the level at the time of the crowdfunding application. We therefore suggest the introduction of SAFE in crowdfunding as a potential solution. SAFE ameliorates the over-valuation problem by setting only minimum requirements such as valuation caps and by delaying the evaluation of corporate value until a follow-up investment is made. However, investor protection should be considered when introducing SAFE in Korea. First, the definition of “subsequent investments” should be clarified to prevent the issuer from intentionally delaying the transfer of shares. Second, the inclusion of financial performance in SAFEs share conversion conditions would prevent the firm from delaying share conversion while receiving favorable cash flows.

The hierarchical cluster analysis and the k-means cluster analysis were performed to classify the types according to the educational performance level of specialized high school. After classifying groups, the differences between groups were analyzed by chi-square test and analysis of variance(ANOVA). According to the analysis, “excellent school” with high educational performance indicators and “low-employment rate school” with high recruitment rate but low employment rate, and low employment rate, and “low recruitment-high school-exit school” with low employment rate but moderate other indicators It could be divided into three groups. As a result of the difference analysis of the main characteristics of each type classified according to educational outcomes, there were differences in school series and establishment type, region and school size, and business performance. Student welfare support and selective educational activities also showed differences in the ratio of budget utilization by group. The research suggests that differentiated approaches are needed for each school to improve the educational performance of specialized high schools, and that policy support is needed considering the school's family and region.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv
Transnational Koreans in Asian Pop Culture in the Pre-Korean Wave Era,2020,"['Korean Wave', 'Asian popular culture', 'Kim Yom', 'Hong Kong film', 'Korean film']",,"The Korean Wave, which refers to the overseas popularity of South Korean culture, is moving toward a new stage of development. Seen in conjunction with the recent performances of K-pop bands on global music platforms, Korean film Parasites winning four prizes at the 92nd Academy Awards in 2020 has led commentators to argue that the whole world is now observing the Korean Wave phenomena. However, while the global rise of Korean pop culture has been documented continuously, most of the research has been centered around either Korean production or foreign consumption. Additionally, while the transnationality of popular culture has led academia to adopt the theory of hybridity, its application to the Korean Wave was largely limited to textual studies. Against this backdrop, this research will shed light on diasporic Korean artistes who have been largely forgotten either in Korea or in their resettled and adopted cultures. In particular, this study will zero in on Korean actors and filmmakers in Shanghai in the 1930s and the Korean-Hong Kongese film collaborations in the 1960s and inquire into their cultural meanings in inter-Asian popular culture. For one, Korean director Jeong Chang-hwa handed down his action film know-how to Hong Kong cinema, which would later become a global action film hub. This relationship continued when the Hong Kong International Film Festival recognized Parasites director Bong Joon-hos talent on the international level first by screening his short films in 1994. As such, this research will also open up new avenues of understanding the history of East Asian popular culture.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

Properties of the tube are distributed across the radius of the tube and are obtained by means of a power law function. It is also assumed that all thermo-mechanical properties are temperature dependent. The governing equations of the tube are obtained using a higher order shear deformation tube theory, where the traction free boundary conditions are satisfied on the top and bottom surfaces of the tube. The von Kármán type of geometrical non-linearity is included into the formulation to consider the large displacements and small strains. Uniform temperature elevation of the tube is also included into the formulation. For the case of tubes which are simply supported in flexure and axially immovable, the governing equations are solved using the two-step perturbation technique. Closed form expressions are provided to obtain the small and large amplitude fundamental natural frequencies of the FGM shallow curved tubes in thermal environment.

Damage sensitive features (DSFs) extracted by traditional methods from linear time series models cannot effectively handle nonlinearity induced by structural damage. A new DSF is proposed based on vector space cosine similarity (VSCS), which combines K-means cluster analysis and Bayesian discrimination to detect nonlinear structural damage. A reference autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model is built based on measured acceleration data. This study first considers an existing DSF, residual standard deviation (RSD). The DSF is further advanced using the VSCS, and then the advanced VSCS is classified using K-means cluster analysis and Bayes discriminant analysis, respectively. The performance of the proposed approach is then verified using experimental data from a three-story shear building structure, and compared with the results of existing RSD. It is demonstrated that combining the linear ARMA model and the advanced VSCS, with cluster analysis and Bayes discriminant analysis, respectively, is an effective approach for detection of nonlinear damage.

This means that consumption of the same cultural products increases the cultural proximity between the regions, thereby promoting trade by increasing preference for consumer goods that involve tastes in the selection. Through this, it is expected that Korea's small and medium-sized enterprises will be able to increase their relatively low exports to Europe. As interest in K-pop and Korean broadcasting is growing in Europe, consumer goods such as cosmetics and food are likely to become promising export items to Europe.

A Prospective Observation of Psychological Distress in Patients With Anaphylaxis,2020,"['Anaphylaxis', 'stress disorders', 'post-traumatic', 'psychological distress', 'anxiety', 'depression']",,"Purpose: Anaphylaxis is an immediate allergic reaction characterized by potentially life-threatening, severe, systemic manifestations. While studies have evaluated links between serious illness and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), few have investigated PTSD after anaphylaxis in adults. We sought to investigate the psychosocial burden of recent anaphylaxis in Korean adults.Methods: A total of 203 (mean age of 44 years, 120 females) patients with anaphylaxis were recruited from 15 university hospitals in Korea. Questionnaires, including the Impact of Event Scale-Revised-Korean version (IES-R-K), the Korean version of the Beck Anxiety Inventory (K-BAI), and the Korean version of the Beck Depression Inventory (K-BDI), were administered. Demographic characteristics, causes and clinical features of anaphylaxis, and serum inflammatory markers, including tryptase, platelet-activating factor, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and C-reactive protein, were evaluated.Results: PTSD (IES-R-K ≥ 25) was noted in 84 (41.4%) patients with anaphylaxis. Of them, 56.0% had severe PTSD (IES-R-K ≥ 40). Additionally, 23.2% and 28.1% of the patients had anxiety (K-BAI ≥ 22) and depression (K-BDI ≥ 17), respectively. IES-R-K was significantly correlated with both K-BAI (r = 0.609, P < 0.0001) and K-BDI (r = 0.550, P < 0.0001). Among the inflammatory mediators, tryptase levels were lower in patients exhibiting PTSD; meanwhile, platelet-activating factor levels were lower in patients exhibiting anxiety and depression while recovering from anaphylaxis. In multivariate analysis, K-BAI and K-BDI were identified as major predictive variables of PTSD in patients with anaphylaxis.Conclusions: In patients with anaphylaxis, we found a remarkably high prevalence of PTSD and associated psychological distresses, including anxiety and depression.

Gatekeeper training is one of the major projects for the national suicide prevention strategy in Korea. The Gatekeeper Behavior Scale (GBS) is a self-reported questionnaire used to evaluate the effects of gatekeeper training. This study aimed to validate the Korean version of the Gatekeeper Behavior Scale (K-GBS).Methods The GBS was translated into Korean, then back-translated to the original language to verify the translation accuracy. Nine hundred middle and high school teachers who participated in gatekeeper training for suicide prevention were included in this study. The construct validity was tested using confirmatory factor analysis. The internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha.Results Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the K-GBS comprised of three factors (preparedness, likelihood, and self-efficacy) with an acceptable model fit (Tucker-Lewis index=0.99, comparative fit index=0.99, root mean square error of approximation=0.03). The Cronbach’s α coefficients were 0.95 for the total scale, 0.94 for preparedness, 0.89 for likelihood, and 0.93 for self-efficacy.Conclusion The K-GBS showed good construct validity and internal consistency. Therefore, it can be a useful tool for assessing the effects of gatekeeper training on suicide prevention in Korea.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv
Cut-Off Scores of an Olfactory Function Test for Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia,2020,"['Dementia', 'Alzheimer’s disease', 'Mild cognitive impairment', 'Olfaction', 'Clinical marker']",,"Objective We aimed to find the optimal cut-off scores for screening of odor detection threshold, odor discrimination, and odor identification tests for detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia in Korean elderly.Methods A total of 195 elderly people were divided into three groups: the normal cognition (NC), MCI, and dementia groups. All participants underwent neurocognitive and olfactory function tests. We used k-means cluster analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to identify the most appropriate cut-off value.Results To distinguish the MCI from NC groups, odor identification [area under the curve (AUC)=0.670, p<0.007] with a cut-off point of 7 showed greater validity for screening (sensitivity/specificity=0.462/0.837) than did other olfactory function tests. To distinguish the MCI and dementia from NC as well, odor identification (AUC=0.817, p=0.002) with a cut-off point of 7 showed the highest validity for screening (0.785/0.654). To distinguish MCI from AD, an odor detection threshold (AUC=0.722, p=0.001) with a cut-off point of 2 showed the highest validity for screening (0.785/0.654).Conclusion Olfactory function tests may be a useful screening tool for cognitive decline before clinical symptoms of dementia have completely developed.

Methods: Secondary data analysis was utilized with data collected from electronic medical records of patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention in a university hospital from 2011 to 2015 and who were on an outpatient follow-up visit as of January 2020. The K-means cluster analysis was performed on seven cardiovascular risk factors. Major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), including hospitalization due to restenosis or cardiac-related death, was required in clinical prognosis. The Cox proportional-hazard regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used. Results: Cluster analysis identified three clusters of ‘obesity and family history’ (n=150), ‘smoking and drinking’ (n=178), and ‘chronic disease’ (n=190). The MACEs occurred in 10.4% of study subjects. When the ‘obesity and family history’ cluster (62.94±12.09 years) was used as a reference, the relative risk of MACEs was 2.57 times higher in the ‘smoking and drinking’ cluster (62.63±13.31 years) and 2.41 times higher in the ‘chronic disease’ cluster (70.90±10.30 years). Conclusion: Cluster-type risk factors are necessary when considering secondary prevention strategies for MACEs in patients with CAD. Patients with smoking, drinking, and chronic diseases are especially required to improve their lifestyles and to regularly monitor their management of underlying diseases during follow-up periods.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

IOL power was determined using SRK/T, Barrett Universal II, and T2 preoperatively. The findings were compared with the actual refractive outcome to obtain the prediction error. The mean prediction error (ME) and mean absolute error (MAE) of each formula were compared. The MAE was defined as the difference between the postoperative spherical equivalence (SE) and the preoperatively predicted SE. The ME and MAE of each formula 3 months after surgery were compared with preoperatively predicted SE. Eyes were classified into subgroups based on axial length (AL) and average keratometry (K).Results: The ME and MAE for the three formulas were SRK/T [-0.08 ± 0.45 diopters (D) and 0.35 ± 0.40 D, respectively], Barrett Universal II (-0.01 ± 0.44 D and 0.33 ± 0.30 D, respectively), and T2 (0.04 ± 0.45 D and -0.34 ± 0.30 D, respectively), but no statistically significant differences were detected. Similar results were obtained in groups with a long AL or a large average K. In groups with an AL ≥ 26 mm or with an average K ≥ 47 D, the Barrett Universal II formula yielded the smallest standard deviation and a ME closest to zero, but these differences were not statistically significant.Conclusions: No significant differences were observed between the three formulas regarding ME or MAE. However, recent formulas such as the Barrett Universal II could provide certain benefits in predicting IOL power for patients with a long AL (> 26 mm) or larger average K. Further research with a larger sample size is recommended for more evaluation.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

The commentary is presented in the form of questions and answers about redundancy, suitability or effectiveness of the sūtras. The notion of anabhihita is introduced in P.2.3.1 which, as an adhikārasūtra(heading rule), serves as a constraint on the introduction of vibhaktis. According to P.2.3.1, a vibhakti can occur after a nominal stem to express a kāraka(thematic role) when the same has not already been expressed by some other means. The need for this rule is demonstrated by comparing it with SA155 which appears to have the same effect as P.2.3.1, and by discussing the scope of P.2.3.46 dealing with the first vibhakti. This verification is based on the fact that the basic meaning of the first vibhakti is ​​number, but not kāraka. In addition, the case where the same vibhakti is ​​applied repeatedly to various components of a sentence is explained in terms of parigaṇana(enumeration).Anabhihitāhnika also examines 12 sūtras from P.2.3.2 to P.2.3.17. It talks about the cases where sūtras may not cover practical usage, and where two vibhaktis or rules may be applied to the identical argument, and where a vibhakti may express anything other than a kāraka.

Automatic Classification Models and Algorithms Based on the Minimum Sum-of-Squared Errors Model,2020,"['Clustering', 'Automatic Classification', 'Mssc', 'Mahalanobis Distance', 'Evolutionary Algorithm']",,"We propose new models and algorithms for automatic classification of objects (clustering) based on the minimum sum-of-squared errors clustering (MSSC) model. Our approach was aimed at improving the accuracy and stability of the result in solving practical problems, such as identifying homogeneous batches of industrial products. We examined the application of the MSSC model and k-means algorithm with various distance measures: Euclidean, Manhattan, Mahalanobis for the problem of automatic classification of objects in a multi-dimensional space of measured parameters (features). For such problems, we present a new model (Mahalanobis Minimum Sum-of-Squared Error Clustering, MMSSC) for solving problems of automatic classification based on the MSSC model with Mahalanobis distance. In addition, we present a new algorithm for automatic classification of objects based on the MMSSC optimization model with the Mahalanobis distance measure and the weighted average covariance matrix calculated from the training sample (pre-labeled data). This algorithm allows us to reduce the number of errors (increasing the Rand index) when identifying homogeneous production batches based on the results of quality control tests. A new approach in the development of evolutionary algorithms for the MSSC problem is presented using a greedy agglomerative heuristic procedure contained in several genetic operators. The use of this approach enables a statistically significant increase in the accuracy of the result (the achieved value of the objective function within the chosen MMSSC mathematical model), as well as its stability, in a fixed time, in comparison with the known algorithms. Thus, in this work, an increase in the accuracy of solving the problem of automatic classification is achieved both by increasing the adequacy of the model (according to the Rand index) and by improving the algorithm that allows us to achieve the best objective function values of within the framework of the chosen model.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

Herein, we aimed to develop the Korean version of the DiN test to provide a useful hearing screening tool for clinical as well as research purposes.Method: Spoken monosyllabic digits from 0 to 9 were recorded by a female speaker. The test list was constructed such that each digit was placed in three different positions. An optimization procedure was conducted to equate the audibility of each digit. After the optimization, the smartphone application for the Korean DiN (K-DiN) test was developed.For the adaptive measurement procedure, 180 new DiN triplets separated into six lists of 30 were created. Mean speech recognition threshold values for each list and session were measured to examine the test-retest and training effects of the test materials. In addition, speech recognition threshold values measured by different devices were compared to determine whether the speech recognition threshold levels differed.Results: Optimization results showed that the mean speech recognition threshold and slope were −11.55 dB signal-to-noise ratio and 10.21%/dB, respectively, which are comparable to levels shown in different-language versions of the DiN test. The results of the test-retest and training effects revealed no significant differences among the test sessions and lists.Additionally, the mean speech recognition threshold values measured by four different devices were not different, indicating the reliability of the test materials.Conclusion: We believe this study is the first to attempt to develop a K-DiN test. Our results indicate that this test can be used as a potentially reliable hearing screening tool.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

The rotor is modeled with the nozzle for attaining a more accurate simulation. The rotor blade is hollowed in order for the coolant to move inside. Also, plenum with the 15 jet nozzles are placed in it. The plenum is fed by compressed fresh air at the rotor hub. Engine operational and real condition is exerted as boundary condition. Rotor is inspected in two states: in existence of cooling technique and non-cooling state. Three-dimensional compressible and steady solutions of RANS equations with SST K-ω turbulent model has been performed for this numerical simulation. The results show that leading edge is one of the most critical regions because of stagnation formation in those areas. Another high temperature region is rotor blade tip for existence of tip leakage in this area and jet impingement cooling can effectively cover these regions. The rotation impact of the jet velocity from hub to tip caused a tendency in coolant streamlines to move toward the rotor blade tip. In addition, by discharging used coolant air from the trailing edge and ejecting it to the turbines main flow by means of the slot in trailing edge, which could reduce the trailing edge wake loss and a total decrease in the blade cooling loss penalty.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

As the air supply size decreased, the flow rate through the air supply was formed relatively uniformly from the inlet to the outlet length of the emergency support system. In addition, the size of the air supply hole was more than 20 mm, the flow rate was very low near the outlet, so the air supply hole size should be smaller than 20 mm. In addition, the minor loss of the air supply hole was calculated to be K = 1.5 from the numerical results. Therefore, the proper design of an emergency evacuation support system is possible using the flow characteristics according to the size and minor loss of the air supply hole.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

Accurate estimation of the types and parameters of noise in hyperspectral images can provide prior knowledge for subsequent image processing. Existing hyperspectral-noise estimation methods often pay more attention to the use of spectral information while ignoring the spatial information of hyperspectral images. To evaluate the noise in hyperspectral images more accurately, we have proposed a spectral-spatial cooperative noiseevaluation method. First, the feature of spatial information was extracted by Gabor-filter and K-means algorithms. Then, texture edges were extracted by the Otsu threshold algorithm, and homogeneous image blocks were automatically separated.

Participant were asked to respond to self-report measures that assess the vocational identity, the status of career compromise, the level of career compromise, and the value discrepancies between ideal and present career goals. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 25.0 for k-means cluster analysis, chi-square test, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA), and Bonferroni post-hoc test. Prior to the main analyses, participants were divided into six vocational identity status groups based on the Vocational Identity Status Assessment. The main results of the study are as follows. First, the status of career compromise was not significantly different among identity status groups. Second, the level of career compromise was significantly different among identity status groups. Post-hoc analyses showed that the level of career compromise of the achievement status was lower than that of undifferentiated and moratorium statuses, and career compromise level of foreclosure, searching moratorium statuses was lower than that of diffusion. Third, group differences of internal value discrepancy were found significant. The results of discrepancies in career values showed that the achievement status was the only status with the internal values of present career goals higher than that of ideal career goals (+), while moratorium and undifferentiated statuses had the highest internal value discrepancy scores (-). This study is meaningful in that it examined the differences between internal and external values among identity statuses, while looking at vocational identity and career compromise as multidimensional factors.

We exploit the fact that respiration signal patterns are unique to each individual, and FMCW radar is employed to obtain the respiration information. Based on the strengths of FMCW radar, the proposed algorithm compensates for the inability to distinguish the respiration signals of multiple users, which are difficult for continuous wave radar to measure. The proposed algorithm also employs a deep neural network algorithm instead of the K-nearest neighbor algorithm that was used in a previous study. The proposed algorithm further improves the performance by using a least mean square filter in the input signal of the DNN.

"Geochemistry, zircon U-Pb ages and Sr-Nd-Hf isotopes of an Early Triassic appinitic complex in southeastern Inner Mongolia, China: implications for the late tectonic evolution of the Paleo-Asian Ocean",2020,"['Early Triassic', 'appinitic complex', 'petrogenesis', 'southeastern Inner Mongolia', 'Central Asian Orogenic Belt']",,"Appinite commonly occurs in convergent plate tectonic settings and thus can constrain the tectonic evolution of ancient orogens. Geochemical and geochronological analyses were carried out on a newly identified Early Triassic appinitic complex in southeastern Inner Mongolia in the eastern segment of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. Petrographically, the Luotuochang complex can be divided into two zones: an outer zone of intermediate rocks and inner zone dominated by mafic rocks. A monzonite sample from the outer zone yielded weighted mean zircon 206Pb/238U ages of 246 ± 1.6 Ma, whereas the gabbro from the inner zone yielded an age of 243 ± 1.2 Ma. The inner zone mafic rocks have SiO2 contents of 45.56 to 54.27 wt% with high MgO, Cr, Ni and Sr contents, elevated Ba/Nb, Ba/Zr, Rb/Y and Th/Zr, and low TiO2, Nb/Zr and Nb/Y. These features suggest that the metasomatized lithospheric mantle is the primitive magma source. SiO2 contents of the outer zone intermediate rocks range from 57.6 to 63.69 wt% and K2O, Ba and Sr contents are enriched; the εNd(t) (+2.2 to +4.0) and εHf(t) (+8.4 to +13.5) values are also high. These characteristics suggest that the magma of these rocks mainly derived from the mantle with possible juvenile lower crust involvement. Based on these geochemical data and results from regional geological investigations, we propose that the Luotuochang appinitic complex was formed in a post-orogenic extensional setting. Its formation was likely the result of lithospheric delamination, upwelling of new mantle material and partial melting of the overlying lower crust during crustal compression and thickening soon after the closure of the restricted Paleo-Asian Ocean basin.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

This Arirang mentions Jang’s experiences as he joined the Guangzhou Uprising and Hailufeng Soviet activities during his stay in Guangzhou, China in 1925∼1927. Compared with other records, it offers descriptions about the situation of the Korean community in Guangzhou in the middle 1920s and Jang’s unique “Guangzhou memories” of Guangzhou Uprising.  Arirang offers some information about the Korean community of Guangzhou in the middle 1920s, recording that 800 Koreans gathered in Guangzhou to participate in the Chinese Revolution until 1927, that these Koreans had something to do mainly with communism, and that a group called K.K. was formed around Korean communists. Other records, however, estimate that 300∼400 Koreans, which were half the estimation of Arirang, gathered in Guangzhou to enroll in Huangpu Military Academy, thus having differences from Arirang. While Arirang mainly mentions Jang""s experiences with Guangzhou Uprising, its descriptions do not cover the Koreans at the Saha battle and the sacrifice of 150 Koreans under Teukmuyeong at Huangpu Military Academy led by Choi Yong-geon during the withdrawal of the uprising combatants, as well as the roles of Kim Seong-suk during Guangzhou Uprising.  Unlike other records, Arirang offers Jang’s unique “Guangzhou memories” because of his “self-description strategy” of some sort reproduced in the oral statement process. Jang, however, made it sure that Arirang contains even his mistakes and limitations in Guangzhou, which suggests that he wrote Arirang as a “lesson” from his experiences after he decided to move to Manchuria during the oral statement rather than a means of simply “showing off” his achievements or “restoring his place at the party register.” Despite its essential nature as a “collection of Jang’s unique memories,” Arirang established itself as part of the “mainstream” memories of Korean people’s Independence Movement in Guangzhou in the 1920s in the Korean society after its liberation. It was not an outcome of Jang’s strategy, but an “unexpected result” of “silence” among other participants that experienced Guangzhou in the prevalent anti-communist atmosphere of Korean society after its liberation.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

The Euclidean distance and Pearson's correlation coefficient were used for the calculation of relational data, and the subgroups of social networks can be obtained by Girvan·Newman algorithm. The clusters using Girvan·Newman algorithm subgroups were evaluated by comparing those by k-means and EM algorithm, which are methods of general cluster analysis.

Generally, the vowels in monosyllabic content words are phonetically more prominent than the ones in monosyllabic function words as the former have phrasal stress, making the vowels in content words longer in length, higher in pitch, and louder in amplitude. This study, based on the speech samples from Korean-Spoken English Corpus (K-SEC) and Rated Korean-Spoken English Corpus (Rated K-SEC), examined 879 English noun phrases, which are composed of an article and a monosyllabic noun, from sentences which are rated on 4 levels of proficiency. The lengths of the vowels in these 879 target NPs were measured and the ratio of the vowel lengths in nouns to those in articles was calculated. It turned out that the higher the proficiency level, the greater the mean ratio of the vowels in nouns to the vowels in articles, confirming the research’s hypothesis. This research thus concluded that for the Korean English learners, the higher the English proficiency level, the better they could produce the stressed and unstressed vowels with more conspicuous length differences between them.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

Comparison of Autophagy mRNA Expression between Chronic Otitis Media With and Without Cholesteatoma,2020,['Autophagy · Otitis media · Cholesteatoma'],,"Background and Objectives: Autophagy is known to be associated with pathogen infection. However, the expression of autophagy-related proteins has not been studied in chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma (COM) or with cholesteatoma (CholeOM). This study aimed to determine whether there is a difference between COM and CholeOM in autophagy-related gene mRNA expression. Subjects and Methods: For 47 patients with chronic otitis media, the inflammatory tissues were classified into granulation tissue (COM) or cholesteatoma (CholeOM) according to biopsy results. Results: PI3K mRNA expression (COM vs. CholeOM, mean±SD, 0.009±0.010 vs. 0.003±0.004; p=0.004) was lower, whereas Beclin-1 mRNA expression (0.089 ± 0.107 vs. 0.176 ± 0.163; p=0.034) was higher in the CholeOM group. Expression of PI3K mRNA in the CholeOM group was lower than that in the COM subgroups with presence of bacteria (0.022±0.019 vs. 0.001±0.001; p=0.001), otorrhea (0.049±0.068 vs. 0.003±0.004; p=0.004), and hearing loss over 40 dB (0.083±0.130 vs. 0.003±0.004; p=0.005).

‘소프트파워 인문학’의 정착을 위한 제언,2020,"['humanistic resources of Korea', 'soft power humanities', 'hyper-connected era', 'national competitiveness', 'country brand']",,"'Soft Power' is a contrasting concept with 'Hard Power' which refers to physical power such as military and economic power. This was presented by Joseph S. Nye, who described it as ""the power to get what you want by attracting peoples’ mind rather than coercion or reward."" As the international status of the US began to falter after 1980s, Nye disputed the decline of the US by claiming that it has strong Soft Power.Nye proposed the concept of ""Soft Power"" as a means to maintain the supremacy of the US in post-Cold War era. 'Soft Power' uses tangible and intangible resources that can be universally sympathized without using oppression or appeasement. And in terms of seeking voluntary consent, cooperation and support through the path of 'inspiration', the concept contains many elements to improve human society. Due to highly developed globalization and hyper-connectedness of communications and media, various information can be exchanged almost unlimitedly at low cost and high speed. Countries with weak Hard Power is now able to raise their national image and power through the expansion of Soft Power. Enhancing “Soft Power” is becoming the focus of attention all over the world, and Korea is no exception.Soft power is a holistic concept composed of various elements. The Korean Wave, which focuses on popular culture such as K-drama, K-film, and K-pop, has greatly contributed to the development of Korea’s Soft Power. However, popular cultural products are less relevant to the nation's awareness, and it is a difficult way for a serious understanding of the humanistic values ​​of Korean society. Also, there is a risk that a scandal or excessive commerciality of individual pop stars could cause a negative effect on the national image. Therefore, Korea's cultural products, which are drawing attention from the international community, and the 'Humanistic Soft Power' resources of the Korean society must be distributed and spread together, in order to promote a long-term and stable Soft Power and raise the overall level and vitality of the 'Korean Wave'.In order to achieve a long-term and reach higher level of national image improvement, Korea needs to develop “Soft Power Humanities” by utilizing the humanistic resources of Korean as a source of Soft Power. In author’s opinion, 'Soft Power Humanities' is a practical humanistic study that re-examines Korean humanistic resources from the perspective of 'Soft Power', and conducts collaborative research that transcends the boundaries and activity fields of academic disciplines, as well as the boundaries of regions and countries. As a wide range of region and diverse culture are set as targets of Soft Power, the cultural disposition and characteristics of each, and the preferred contents and formats are also included in the interests of ​​research.Soft Power Humanities not only could be a process of deepening academic research, but also pursues ideas to solve problems faced by Korea and the world. The publicity of scholarship will also be enhanced by establishment and implementation of a system that reflects humanistic values ​​in the research. If we spread and practice humanistic values in Korean society in advance, and deliver it to the international community further on, it will not only enhance the national brand but also improve human life.If the Humanistic research in Korea discuss the concept of 'Soft Power Humanities' and promote related academic fields, it will not only encourage the expansion of the reflective study, but also be able to better respond to the social expectations. Based on the idea that further interest and research in this field need to be promoted for strengthening Korea's Humanistic Soft Power, I suggest rudimentary opinions to academia.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

The vast number of features makes intuitive understanding of a target domain difficult. Dimensionality reduction or manifold learning has potential to circumvent this obstacle, but restricted methods have been preferred. Objective The objective of this study is to observe the characteristics of various dimensionality reduction methods—locally linear embedding (LLE), multi-dimensional scaling (MDS), principal component analysis (PCA), spectral embedding (SE), and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)—on the RNA-Seq dataset from the genotype-tissue expression (GTEx) project. Results The characteristics of the dimensionality reduction methods are observed on the nine groups of three different tissues in the reduced space with dimensionality of two, three, and four. The visualization results report that each dimensionality reduction method produces a very distinct reduced space. The quantitative results are obtained as the performance of k-means clustering. Clustering in the reduced space from non-linear methods such as LLE, t-SNE and SE achieved better results than in the reduced space produced by linear methods like PCA and MDS. Conclusions The experimental results recommend the application of both linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction methods on the target data for grasping the underlying characteristics of the datasets intuitively.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

They also verified the differences between firms that actually reduced taxes and those that did not. First, firms faced with financial constraints are difficult to finance externally, thus reducing taxes paid as one of the methods of internal financing. The tax plan used to reduce taxes was difficult to predict the scope of the investment and firms expected to increase the volatility of the taxes paid in the future. Second, if companies facing financial constraints actually invest in cash-saving tax plans, future tax payment volatility is expected to increase as tax authorities are more likely to detect tax investigations. Financial constraints used KZ-index presented by Kaplan and Zingales (1997) and K-score suggested by Altman (1968). The variability in future tax payments used the standard deviation of the cash effective tax rate (CASH ETR).As a result of empirical analysis, financial constraint and future tax payment volatility showed a significant positive relationship. This means that companies faced with financial constraints will invest in a wide range of tax plans, resulting in greater volatility in future taxes. In addition, this study compares the relationship between financial constraints and future tax payment volatility by dividing into tax-saving and non-tax-saving companies. As a result, only the companies that reduced taxes had a significant positive relationship between financial constraints and future tax payment volatility. This is interpreted as a significant positive relationship between financial constraints and future tax payment volatility due to the effect of companies that have actually paid taxes.This study has different points and contributions in the following points. First, the prior study was expanded by looking at the relationship between financial constraints and future tax payment variability by dividing the actual tax paid in cash into entities and entities that did not, compared to the Akamah et al.(2018) that verified the relationship between financial constraints and future tax payment variability. Second, the empirical results of this study that there is a positive relationship between financial constraints and future tax payment variability are expected to provide useful information to the entity's stakeholders in making investment decisions.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

On the other hand, the antigenic relatedness and efficacy of IBV vaccines against these 2 field IBV strains are not well characterized. Objectives: This study aimed to determine the antigen relatedness and efficacy of different IB vaccine strains against a challenge with MV and QX-like strains. Methods: The antigen relatedness and the ability of different IB vaccine strains in conferring protection against MV and QX-like were assessed based on the clinical signs, macroscopic lesions, and ciliary activity. Results: The MV strain IBS037A/2014 showed minor antigenic subtype differences with the vaccine virus Mass H120 and 4/91 strains but showed major antigenic subtype differences with the K2 strain. The Malaysian QX-like strain IBS130/2015 showed major antigenic subtype differences with the MV strain IBS037A/2014 and the vaccine strains except for K2. Chickens vaccinated once with Mass (H120) or with non-Mass (4/91 and K2) developed antibody responses with the highest antibody titer detected in the groups vaccinated with H120 and 4/91. The mean ciliary activities of the vaccinated chickens were between 56 to 59% and 48 to 52% in chickens challenged with IBS037A/2014 and IBS130/2015, respectively. The vaccinated and challenged birds showed mild to severe lesions in the lungs and kidneys.

OBSERVING SITES FOR THE CENTRAL SOLAR ECLIPSES IN ANCIENT CHINESE HISTORY,2020,"['eclipses', 'ephemerides', 'history and philosophy of astronomy']",,"We determine the observing sites for eclipses of large magnitude recorded in ancient Chinese chronicles from 200 BCE to 900 CE, by adopting the difference between terrestrial time and universal time, ΔT, given by Morrison & Stephenson (2004). The records of solar eclipses with large magnitude are divided into four groups in accordance with the historical variations of the capital cities of ancient Chinese dynasties. We determine areas in which all the eclipses in each group, with an eclipse magnitude larger than a certain threshold value, could be observed. We find that these areas coincide with the historical capitals, which agrees with the general idea that the solar eclipses were observed at the capital of each dynasty. This result also verifies the ΔT values during the period from 100 BCE to 400 CE, during which historical records of eclipses are so rare that the ΔT values can only be obtained by interpolating the long-term data. Moreover, we show that the eclipses described by the term Ji in East-Asian history are not all total eclipses; their mean magnitude is 0.96 ± 0.04. We find that complementary expressions, such as dark daytime and appearance of stars during the eclipse, strengthen the possibility that eclipses described by the term Ji were total. We also provide quantitative definitions for expressions such as 'being not complete and like a hook', 'being almost complete', 'visibility of stars during the eclipse', and 'darkness during an eclipse.' The literal meanings of these expressions are in agreement with the recent physical modeling of sky brightness during total eclipses provided by Können & Hinz (2008).",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

Also, when crops are grown on biochar-applied soil, their characteristics may be affected. Biochar is used especially with commercial vegetable seedlings.METHODS AND RESULTS: The objective of this study was to determine the effects of biochar content in seeding mixes on early growth of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa L.), and red pepper (Capsicum annuum L.). Treatments consisted of a control (0: 10, ratio of biochar to seeding mixes (w/w)), 1: 9 (biochar 10%), 3: 7 (biochar 30%), 5: 5 (biochar 50%), and 7: 3 (biochar 70%). The biochar was made from risk husk and had a C/N ratio of 104. As the mixing ratio of biochar increased, pH increased whereas EC and nitrogen content decreased. The highest phosphorus content was with the treatment of 30% biochar, while there were significant increases in the weight of lettuce seedlings and concentrations of T-N, P2O5, K2O, MgO, and Na with the treatments of 30% and 50% biochar. Although the weight of Chinese cabbage seedlings increased with the treatment of 10% biochar, the increase was not statistically significant. Also, there was an increase in the weight of red pepper seedlings with the treatment of 30% biochar, but the increase was not statistically significant. With increases in the biochar mixing ratio, the K2O concentration of red pepper seedlings increased, but the concentrations of P2O5, CaO, MgO, and Na decreased. It was believed that this was because of absorption inhibition by calcium-phosphate formation in the seeding mixes owing to increased pH. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, adding biochar to seeding mixes is considered to be an important mean for growing healthy vegetable seedlings. More field experiments are needed to verify the effect of biochar on vegetable crop growth over the entire growing season.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

'Attā' in 'Anattā' refers to the eternal, unchanging, and metaphysical substance (Ātman) as argued by Upaniṣads. I have found that five aggregates (pañcakkhadhā) are not the metaphysical substance and that there is no such unchanging substance, by examining mainly The Characteristic of Nonself (S22:59) and the Dependent Origination.The Stream-enterer (Sotāpanna) who achieved the first Enlightenment removed the first three fetters (saṃyojanā) ― personality view (sakkāyadiṭṭhi), doubt (vicikicchā), and clinging to rites and ceremonies (sīlabbataparāmāsa) among the five lower fetters (pañca orambhāgiyāni saṃyojanāni). The 'personality view' is what views five aggregates as Self (attā). The Stream-enterer is the first Noble One who gained the view that each of five aggregates is not Self.The Once-returner (Sakadāgāmī) who achieved the second Enlightenment does not remove any fetters, but sensual desire (kāmarāga) that is a kind of greed (lobha) and ill will (paṭigha) that is a kind of anger (dosa) weakened. The reason why greed and anger weakened was that delusion (moha) that was their cause or condition weakened. This delusion is the main cause that causes us to see five aggregates as Self. Thus it can be said that the achievement of Once-returner is also related to the insight into Nonself.The Non-returner (Anāgāmī) who achieved the third Enlightenment removed the two remaining fetters ― sensual desire and ill will among the five lower fetters. These sensual desire and ill will are other expressions for greed and anger. The fact that he removed greed and anger means that he removed delusion which is its cause or condition. The fact that he removed the delusion that there was Self means that the insight into Nonself deepened.The Arahant who achieved the fourth and final Enlightenment removed the five higher fetters (pañca uddhamghāgiyāni saṃyojanāni) ― desire for fine material existence (rūparāga), desire for immaterial existence (arūparāga), conceit (māna), restlessness (uddhacca), and ignorance (avijjā). The fact that he removed ignorance or delusion means that he had a perfect insight into whatever is in mind and matter (nāma-rūpa) is not an unchanging substance, and that he mastered the truth of Nonself. The Arahant who mastered Nonself perfectly came to remove the remaining fetters ― desire for fine material existence, desire for immaterial existence, conceit, and restlessness. Therefore it can be concluded that Nonself is the beginning and end of Enlightenment.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

This worldview was first introduced by S. Kierkegaard, a Danish philosopher in the 19th century. It is divided into atheistic and so humanistic existentialism, denying the existence of God and theistic existentialism which acknowledges that of God. This worldview is still very active because it has some attractive and strong aspects but it has critically weak points, too. This article, therefore, discusses the concrete contents of atheistic and theistic existentialism first and then mentions the representative atheistic thinkers such as J. P. Sartre and A. Camus and theistic thinkers such as S. Kierkegaard, K. Jaspers and G. Marcel. After that, not only its strong aspects but also its weak and self-contradictory points are investigated.

The purpose of this study is to identify and classify the main characteristics of user behavior of smartphone cameras in Generation Z. Understanding the group behaviors of smartphone camera users can be useful for UX design development of smartphone cameras and related services.Methods : We conducted a case study of smartphone camera apps preferred by Generation Z and identified the main characteristics of the apps. Based on these findings, we organized preliminary surveys to understand the overall camera usage and to select proper interviewees. In an interview, we asked questions related to motivation, context, and behavior and analyzed the common responses through affinity diagrams. Then, we conducted the second survey and ask the participants to respond on how the derived features correspond to them using a five-point scale. Finally, we used the K-means algorithm to classify the categories of camera use behaviors and derived the prominent responses of each type.Results : The characteristics of smartphone camera usage of Generation Z are classified into six categories: ‘convenience’, ‘memory record’,‘artist’s expression’, ‘communication’, ‘naturalness’, and ‘consciousness ofothers’. Group A was mostly female (90%), which shows high levels of ‘convenience’and ‘memory records’ in camera usage. They mainly produce content for selfsatisfaction and tend to avoid complicated steps in shooting and editing. Group B is also female (76%) with high levels of all categories except ‘memory record’. They take pictures and edit them according to their own tastes and upload them to SNS to use feed as their self-branding space. Group C is mostly male (93%) with high levels of ‘convenience’, ‘communication’, and ‘naturalness’. They tend to create visual content to communicate with the people around them, and hence, it is easy for them to shoot and edit.Conclusions : This study derives six characteristics and three categories of smartphone camera usage behavior of Generation Z. The results of this study can be used as an important criterion for organizing existing functions and setting up new functions targeting generation Z.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

The invasion of Western powers, which began at the end of the 19th century, opened the doors of China, and Korea also began to undergo drastic social changes due to Japanese aggression and colonial rule. In the process of spreading capitalist culture centered on Western Europe and Japan, Korean and Chinese pop music developed into diverse forms through fusion and harmony, not the dichotomy between traditional and foreign styles.  In the 1930s, K-pop and Chinese pop developed with the popularity of ‘Shin Minyo’ and ‘Shin Min-ga’ based on their respectively traditional folk songs.  In this text, we will look at the musical content of Korea’s “Shin Minyo” and China’s “Shin Min-ga,” which were widely sung in the 1930s and 40s and is an important part of pop music.

AWBA was developed to overcome the limitations of existing posture risk assessment tools in evaluating such agricultural work postures. AWBA consisted of selecting upper-limb posture and lower-limb posture from AULA (Agricultural Whole-Body Assessment) and ALLA (Agricultural Lower-Limb Assessment). Since AWBA did not consider the workload, there was a limitation in assessing workloads and weights.Method: The modification of AWBA was conducted based on the compression force of the lumbar disc computed by 3D-SSPP software. According to working type (onehanded and two-handed) and weight (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10kg), the lumbar disc compression force was used to subdivide the current risk levels of AWBA. K-means analysis was used to subdivide each level, and the number of sub-levels was decided by the Nbclust package in Rstudio. For comparison between tools, the posture risk of 30 agricultural works was evaluated according to the height of the working point.Results: Based on the current level of AWBA, level 1 and level 2 were divided into three sub-levels, and level 3 and level 4 were divided into four. A total of 11 tables were newly created according to the existing AWBA""s posture combination and workload type. As a result of comparing the posture risk assessment results according to the height of the working point, AWBA and Revised AWBA evaluated higher than other tools at the lower working point.Conclusion: Revised AWBA was modified by subdividing the existing AWBA results based on the lumbar compression force only. Therefore, in further studies, Re-AWBA would be improved by collecting various biomechanical data according to each posture and workload.Application: Revised AWBA could be used more effectively than existing tools for evaluating the risk in agricultural work. It is believed that it would help eliminate the risk factors that exist in agricultural sites.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

How can the church community help individuals who are going through heavy sorrow associated with the loss of daily living activities due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic The church community and practical theologians have to cope with and research on these concerns more actively, coming up with practical alternatives. To this end, the researcher, in application of John Bowlby's attachment theory, intends to argue that separation anxiety experienced by individuals due to the grief at the loss of daily routines would rather be an opportunity to help the individuals to realize that the true spiritual attachment object is God the Creator. In addition, the church community should be prepared to provide a place of mourning where individuals could experience secure attachment again in appropriate ways - either face-to-face or non-face-to-face - to individuals experiencing separation anxiety caused by the grief at the loss of daily routines. For this purpose, at first, this study is aimed to understand what the sorrow caused by the loss is like. And then, from the perspective of Bowlby's attachment theory, in-depth examination will be conducted on the separation anxiety caused by the sorrow of loss, which, as a means of mourning in a healthy way, will be followed by consideration of a grief counseling process for overcoming loss, along with a further attempt to apply it to the dimension of pastoral counseling, suggested by Charles Bachmann, David K. Switzer, Herbert Anderson, Kenneth R. Mitchell, Stephen J. Freeman. Through this research process, this study will suggest that the process of mourning the loss of daily routines can serve as an opportunity for Christians, let alone ordinary individuals, to examine and develop their own faith. It’s because if an individual can continuously have such experiences as secure attachment introduced by Bowlby within the church community, it would be arguably possible to mourn in a healthy way the grief at the unexpected loss of daily routines, as pouring out the heart of grief, crying and laughing together within a secure base like the church community. None are free from the grief coming from any unexpected, sudden loss in the midst of life journey. Whenever an individual goes through loss, however, if he/she could experience mourning together with a healthy community, instead of being despaired only, afterward a great opportunity of turning life to be more abundant than ever before will be made available.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

Towards DES in CFD-based optimization: The case of a sharp U-bend with/without rotation,2020,['· Numerical optimization · Pressure loss · CFD · Rotation · Turbulent flow · U-bend'],,"Channels with a sharp U-bend are typical elements of convective cooling systems designed for blades of high-temperature gas turbines. The flow passing a sharp bend is characterized by a high level of pressure loss that is attributed to development of intensive secondary flows, as well as to formation of a large-size separation adjacent to the divider wall. A considerable reduction of pressure losses can be achieved by proper changes in geometry of the walls forming the U-bend, first of all, in the divider wall geometry. The paper presents results of CFD-based optimization of a stationary or orthogonally rotating U-bend of strong curvature. Baseline geometry is same as used by Cheah et al. (1996) for detailed measurements of U-duct isothermal turbulent flow at the Reynolds number of 10 5 , with and without system rotation. The minimization of the total pressure loss in the bend is achieved by means of a hybrid numerical optimization method that uses design of experiments and a metamodel for fast surrogate modeling of the design space. Optimization databases are produced by incompressible fluid unsteady RANS-(k-w)-SST calculations. Due to optimization of the divider wall profile, the total pressure loss coefficient has been reduced by 47-67 % depending on the rotation number (Ro = 0,±0.2). For the original and the optimized shapes of the bend, simulation is performed also with the eddy-resolving IDDES method validated against the velocity field and pressure measurement data for the original geometry. For optimized shapes, IDDES predicts somewhat lower pressure losses comparing to the RANS model, by 3 to 15 % depending on the rotation number.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

This model accommodates the physical constraint to designate the vehicle stop location in front of the traffic signals. The model is trained by vehicle experiment data with three drivers through the hyper-parameter optimization method. Using this model, the deceleration characteristics are characterized by two explicit parameters such that deceleration point, maximum point according to the initial slope and the shape of the braking profile. Using these two parameters as clustering variables through a K-means clustering method, the deceleration types are classified. These deceleration types to the input to the prediction model results in higher prediction accuracy of the vehicle states.

Specifically, I studied the religious situation in India before Islam came in. Then I examined the descriptions of Islamic forces found in Hindu and Jaina sources. And then I analysed diverse perceptions between the two traditions stemmed from their different doctrines and religious characteristics. Before the invasion of Islam or their complete conquest in the Indian subcontinent, Indian religions had the golden age in terms of religious thought, culture, and art resulted from the development of Sanskrit literature and temple architecture with the support of local dynasties. However, after the invasion, Islam destroyed various statues and temples since they strictly forbid idolatry, so traditional Indian religious finally lost their patronages. We can find this fearful situation for Indian religions in a variety of Indian literature as they refer to Muslims as Yavana, Mleccha, Śaka, etc., which mean basically ‘barbarians’.  It is noteworthy that Hinduism and Jainism differently adapted to this new environment to coexist with Islam. It is due to different groups who support each religion. While Kṣatriya class sustains brahmins, the prominent supporter of Jainism is Vaiśya class. That is, the invasion of Islamic forces brought about the political and religious decline of local dynasties, so it immediately affected to Hinduism. However, in the case of Jainism, their patronage, whose class mainly engages in commerce, was not directly damaged by the invasion. Moreover, under the influence of this Islam rules, Jainism rather could have a purification movement to return to Jaina asceticism by eliminating tantric features that had affected to Jainism before.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

This process forms the basis for determining the distribution of stochastic discontinuities within a homogeneous structural domain; however, it neglects large-scale discontinuities. In this study, the statistically homogeneous structural domains within a large-scale jointed rock mass were meticulously demarcated in three dimensions, which was performed in four steps. 1) A three-dimensional discontinuity network model was constructed containing both deterministic and stochastic discontinuities. 2) The model was subsequently discretized into a large number of cubic grids, and the MBi values of all the grids were calculated. 3) Using the K-means algorithm, the structural domain boundaries within the tested rock mass were meticulously demarcated, and a composited model consisting of homogeneous structural domains was constructed. 4) Each homogeneous structural domain was separately visualized. This demarcation method can consider large-scale discontinuities and improve the identification sensitivity in a large-scale jointed rock mass with a high accuracy.

Likewise, what is the art of life for the young people of neo-nihilism times which annihilated even their will or hope to get over the annihilation? The starting point of life art for the youth of neo-nihilism times is to introspect the identity of the world where one resides. Further, together with the introspection as to the identity of one’s viewpoint over the world, it is necessary for the youth to have a practical molding corresponding thereto. If so, what type of life is the real one to harmonize introspection and molding? A short story which keenly describes before, after, and between a bout of match against the Sirens who are the absolutely unrivaled stronger is Franz Kafka’s “The Silence of the Sirens(Das Schweigen der Sirenen)”. Nietzsche also presents survival technique getting over nihilistic times as an extreme pessimist no less than Kafka. He confronts the truth of life which looks horrible and presents survival craft playing with it. This is ‘Dionysian artist(Dionysischer Künstler)’ presented by Nietzsche’s “Dionysian world view(Die Dionysische Weltanschauung)”. This is the art distinguished from Apollo(the god of dream) or Dionysus(the god of euphoria(Rausch))which are known widely through The Birth of Tragedy. It is the art playing with both instead of being caught in dream or euphoria. In this paper, this writer will catch the art of survival in the absolute poverty of N-po times through Kafka’s insufficient and childish means, and reinterpret philosophically it through three types of artstes in Nietzsche.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv
취득 단계의 취득가액과 양도 단계의 취득가액 비교・연구: 세법상 건설자금이자의 취급을 중심으로,2020,"['취득가액', '건설자금이자', '차입원가', '자본화', '자본화기간', 'Acquisition Value', 'Interest on Construction Funds', 'Borrowing Costs', 'Capitalization', 'Capitalization Period']","건설자금이자가 취득가액에 포함되는지 여부는 취득세의 과세표준 혹은 소득금액 계산상 필요경비를 다르게 결정하게 되어, 결과적으로는 세부담 증감에 직접적인 영향을 미친다. 취득세를 규정하는 지방세법과 양도소득세를 규정하는 법인세법 및 소득세법의 입법 취지가 서로 다르고, 개별세법은 고유한 정책적 목적 등에 따라 규정될 수 있다는 점을 고려하여 볼 때, 개별세법에서 취득가액 관련 규정을 모두 동일하게 두어야 한다고 할 수는 없다. 하지만, 개별세법규정의 목적 등을 고려하더라도 그것을 달리 규정할 특별한 이유가 있지 아니하다면, 개별세법규정은 통일성을 유지하는 것이 바람직하다. 개별세법상 그 규정을 달리 정하여야 할 특별한이유가 있는 경우라면, 그것을 해석하는 논리는 일관되고 합목적적이어야 할 것이다. 개별세법에서 시의적절하고 구체적인 규정을 마련하고 있지 못한 상황 하에서는 공정･타당한 기업회계기준 규정을 보충적으로 적용함으로써 보다 합리적인 과세체계의 기반을 마련할 수 있다.지방세법은 건설자금에 충당한 차입금의 이자와 관련한 구체적인 규정을 두고 있지 않으므로, 일반적으로 공정･타당하다고 인정되는 기업회계기준을 보충적으로 적용･해석하여야할 것이다. 하지만 기업회계기준을 보충적으로 적용하는 경우 개별 기업이 따르는 한국채택국제회계기준(K－IFRS), 일반기업회계기준 등의 회계기준에 따라 취득세의 과세표준이 달라질 수 있는 문제가 있다. 취득 단계에서의 취득가액, 즉 취득세의 과세표준은 과세대상 물건을 취득하는 과정에서의 적절한 담세력을 측정하는 수단이라고 할 수 있다. 취득세 과세대상물건에 대한 건설자금이자를 취득가액에 가산한다는 것은 취득 과정에서의 담세력이 증가한것으로 본다는 의미인데, 건설자금이자의 발생 사실이 취득 과정에서의 담세력과 대응되지는 않는 것으로 판단된다. 따라서 건설자금이자가 취득세의 과세표준을 변동시키는 요인으로 작용하지 않도록 관련 규정을 개선하는 것이 바람직할 것이다. 하지만 현행 지방세법에서는 취득가액에 포함되는 간접비용으로 건설자금이자를 규정하고 있으므로, 이를 전제로 한다면, 과세대상 자산 취득과의 관련성 측면, 형식상 이자비용의 실질 측면, 수직적 형평성과수평적 형평성 측면, 기업회계기준의 보충적 적용 측면에서 고려하여 볼 때, 공사 중단기간동안 발생한 건설자금이자는 취득세의 과세표준에 포함하지 않는 것이 합리적일 것이다.","Whether to include the interest on construction funds in the acquisition price determines the tax base of the acquisition tax or the necessary expenses for calculating the income amount, thus having a direct impact on the increase or decrease of the tax burden. One cannot say that all separate tax laws must apply the same rule, considering the different legislative purposes of the local tax law, which regulates the acquisition tax, and the corporate tax law and income tax law, which regulate the capital gains tax. Moreover, each tax law will be regulated according to its own policy purpose. However, although the purposes of separate tax laws are different, it is desirable to maintain uniformity in the provisions of separate tax laws unless there is a special reason to stipulate otherwise. Despite the different regulations of separate tax laws, they should be interpreted with a consistent logic for suitable purposes. If the separate tax laws do not provide timely and specific regulations, the authorities can establish a more rational taxation system by supplementally applying the provisions of fair and reasonable corporate accounting standards.Since the local tax law does not provide specific regulations regarding the interest on borrowings for construction funds, it would be reasonable to supplement and interpret the accounting standards that are generally recognized as fair and proper. But there is a problem that the tax base of acquisition tax may vary depending on the different accounting standards of each enterprise such as K-IFRS(Korean-International Financial Reporting Standards) or GAAP(Generally Accepted Accounting Principles). The asset value at the acquisition stage, which becomes the tax base of acquisition tax, can be used as a standard for calculating the tax paying ability in the process of acquiring taxable goods.Adding the interest on construction period to the acquisition value of the assets subject to acquisition tax means that it is regarded as an increase in the tax paying ability. However, the incurred interest during the construction period has no correlation to the ability to pay taxes in the acquisition process. Therefore, it would be desirable to revise related regulations so that the interest on construction period does not change the tax base of acquisition tax. But the current local tax law regulates the interest on construction period as an indirect cost included in the acquisition value. So on the premise of this, it would be reasonable not to include the interest incurred during the period of construction suspension in the tax base of the acquisition tax, considering the relevance to the acquisition of buildings, the real aspect of formal interest expenses, the vertical and the horizontal equity, and the supplementary application of corporate accounting standards.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

Results of the multiple regression models with the daily number of visitors of the 18 trails indicated that the events, such as the National Foundation Day celebration of Snow Festival, affected the number of visitors of all of the 18 trails and were the most critical factor that determined the daily number of visitors to the Taebaeksan National Park. The long-holidays of three days or longer and other national holidays also affected the daily number of visitors to the trails. Precipitation had a negative impact on the number of visitors of trails where the intention of most visitors was for sightseeing or camping instead of hiking, whereas had no significant impacts on the number of visitors of trails where many visitors intended for hiking. It indicated that visitors who intended for hiking went ahead hiking even if the weather was poor. The effects of temperature had a positive effect on the number of visitors who intended for hiking but a negative effect on the number of visitor to the trails near Danggol Plaza where the Snow Festival was held in each winter, suggesting that the impact of the Snow Festival was the deterministic factor for trail management. Results of K-mean clustering showed that the 18 trails of the Taekbaeksan National Park could be classified into three types: those affected by the Snow Festival (type 1), those that have sightseeing points and so were visited mostly by non-hikers (type 2), and those visited mostly by hikers (type 3). Since visitor behaviors and illegal actions differ according to the trail type, this study’s results can be used to prepare a trail management plan based on the trail characteristics.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv
Does work time limit for resident physician affect short-term treatment outcome and hospital length of stay in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage?: a two-year experience at a single training hospital in South Korea,2020,"['Work hour restriction', 'Resident', 'Mortality', 'Outcome', 'Length of stay']",,"Objective: To compare short-term treatment outcomes at hospital discharge and hospital length of stay (LOS) in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) before and after introduction of resident physician work time limit (WTL).Methods: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients treated for sICH at our institution between 2016 and 2019. Then we dichotomized these patients into two groups, pre-WTL and post-WTL. We analyzed demographic elements and clinical features, and hospital length of stay (LOS). We evaluated short-term outcome using modified Rankin scale score at hospital discharge and then divided it into “good” and “poor” outcome groups. We subsequently, compared short-term treatment outcome and hospital LOS between the pre-WTL and post-WTL groups.Results: Out of 779 patients, 420 patients (53.9%) were included in the pre-WTL group, and 359 (46.1%) in post-WTL. The mortality rate in sICH patients was higher in the post-WTL group (pre-WTL; 13.6% vs. post-WTL; 17.3%), but there was no statistically significant difference in short-term outcome including mortality (p=0.332) between the groups. The LOS also, was not significantly different between the two groups (pre-WTL; 19.0 days vs. post-WTL; 20.2 days) (p=0.341). The initial Glasgow Coma Scale score, personal stroke history, and mean age were the only independent outcome predicting factors for patients with sICH.Conclusions: Some neurosurgeons may expect poorer outcome for sICH after implementation of the WTL of the K-MHW for resident physician however, enforcement of the WTL did not significantly influence the short-term outcome and hospital LOS for sICH in our hospital. Further well-designed multi-institutional prospective studies on the effects of WTL in sICH patient outcome, are anticipated.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

If we misunderstand these two concepts, it leads to mutual contradictions, so I must explain first the point that the two concepts are complementary. Also, from the standpoint of true original nature, ‘hwadu’ can be interpreted as means 'before a thought arises in an inherently undefiled mind’. Therefore, we should not understand these two concepts to be contradictory or in opposition. In this framework, I tried to explain Ven. Daehaeng’s ganhwa practice in terms of true original nature (the true reality of things as they are). In this paper I examined ganhwa-seon [看話禪 Gong'an (J. kōan) contemplation; a Chan/Seon/Zen meditation method that seeks direct attainment of enlightenment through investigation of the 'keyword 話頭'] from three perspectives based on the following interpretations. First of all, I noted that the traditional interpretation and understanding of ganhwa-seon emphasized ‘expedient means’, whereas Ven. Daehaeng mainly stressed its relationship to ‘true original nature’. Second, if we understand Daehaeng's interpretation of ‘hwadu’ in terms of true original nature, we can understand the relationship between her practice of ‘juingong’ (主人空 one's own pristine inner-self or self-nature) contemplation and traditional hwadu contemplation. If ganhwa-seon is focused on amassing doubt through hwadu contemplation, then Daehaeng's hwadu practice emphasizes the ‘gwan’ (觀 Skt. vipaśyanā, meditative insight, analytical meditation, or observation meditation) aspect more by focusing one’s mind on its own true nature. Ven. Daehaeng understood hwadu practice, seon practice and gwan practice to be one and the same. Lastly, I examined the relationship between traditional ganhwa-seon and Ven. Daehaeng's version of it. While traditional ganhwa-seon emphasizes the three elements of great faith, great effort, and great doubt, Ven. Daehaeng's ‘ganhwa’ emphasizes ‘gwan' or ’observation’. In particular, when we compare this with the concepts of the ‘five spiritual faculties’ (五根) and ‘five spiritual powers’ (五力), important concepts in Early and Theravada Buddhism, then the differences between Ven. Daehaeng’s ganhwa and traditional ganhwa seon become clear. ‘Great faith’ in Ven. Daehaeng's ganhwa is the fundamental element in realizing one’s true original nature, which leads to 'gwan'. In this context, 'gwan' corresponds to the 'great doubt' emphasized in traditional ganhwa-seon. In ‘Daehaeng seon’, 'great doubt' exists, but it is not as important as it is in traditional ganhwa-seon.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv
Doped Two-dimensional Semiconductor Superlattice: Photo-stimulated Quantum Thermo-magnetoelectric Effects under the Influence of a Confined Phonon,2020,"['Photo-stimulated quantum thermo-magnetoelectric effects', 'Doped two-dimentional semiconductor superlattice', 'Quantum Ettingshausen coefficient', 'Quantum Peltier coefficient', 'Quantum kinetic equation', 'Confined phonon', 'Conductivity tensor', 'Thermo-electric tensor', 'Kinetic tensor']",,"Photo-stimulated quantum thermo-magnetoelectric effects in doped two-dimensional semiconductor superlattices, including the photo-stimulated quantum Ettingshausen effect and the photo-stimulated quantum Peltier effect, have been theoretically studied by using the quantum kinetic equation method. In this work, we assume that the electron-confined acoustic phonon scattering is essential. Moreover, the presence of the laser radiation (LR) is also taken into account to determine the influence of confined phonons on the aforementioned effects. We have defined the analytical expressions for the kinetic tensors and the Ettingshausen and the Peltier coefficients, presented the numerically calculated the theoretical results for the GaAs:Si/GaAs:Be doped semiconductor superlattice and compared them with these for the case of an unconfined acoustic phonon. The results obtained indicated that the formulas for the kinetic tensors, the Ettingshausen coefficient (EC) and the Peltier coefficient (PC) contain the quantum number m specifying the confinement of a phonon and approach the results for an unconfined phonon as m goes to zero. We found that the kinetic tensors, the EC and the PC oscillate with changing magnetic field and that the confinement of a phonon causes a shift of the peaks in these oscillations to lower energy. The dependences of both EC and PC on the temperature were found to be nonlinear. Moreover, all the coefficients level off when the temperature was less than 4.5 K or greater than 5.5 K. The EC also depended on the doping concentration in a nonlinear way and reaches a positive constant value when the semiconductor superlattice was doped with a high concentration. Most of the numerical results showed that the magnitude of the tensors, the EC as well as the PC, within a confined acoustic phonon varie significantly in comparison with the unconfined phonon case. This means that the confinement of the phonon affects the thermo-magnetoelectric effect quantitatively and qualitatively.These results contribute to completing the theory of the thermo-magnetoelectric effects in the low-dimensional semiconductor systems.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv
Critique of the Theory of Nature (xing) and Principle (li) in the Philosophy of Zhu Xi: Matteo Ricci and Chŏng Yagyong,2020,"['the supreme ultimate (taiji)', 'principle (li)', 'cause or the reason for the existence and operation of qi (suoyi)', 'human nature (xing)', 'appetite or preference/proclivity [for the moral good] (sŏng kiho)']",,"Taking recourse to the Aristotelian theory of four causes and the distinction between substance and accidents, as well as to the concept of intellectual consciousness (lingjue 靈覺), Matteo Ricci (Li Madou 利瑪竇, 1552–1610) argued that the notions of taiji 太極 and li 理 as expounded by Zhu Xi 朱熹 (1130–1200) cannot serve as the origin of existence, as their metaphysical equivalent God, does in Catholic Christianity. Taiji and li do not have consciousness and are moreover merely “accidents.” Unlike “substance,” an “accident” is something that is not essential for something to be what it is. Tasan Chŏng Yagyong 茶山 丁若鏞 (1762– 1836) follows Ricci in claiming that li is but an accident, and no more than the “formal cause” of each individual object. A “formal cause” is what something is or should be, as distinct from the “material cause” (that of which it is made), the “efficient cause” (that which gives it shape or motion), or the “final cause” (the goal for which it is intended). Ricci and Tasan did not acknowledge the role of li as the “principle, ground, cause or the reason for the existence and operation of qi 氣” (suoyi 所以) as held by Zhu Xi’s school of nature and principle. Like Ricci, Tasan also dismissed the concept of taiji as “the undifferentiated state before heaven and earth came to be divided.” However, Tasan diverged markedly from Ricci with respect to the critique of the tenet “Nature is in fact principle (Xing ji li 性卽理)”. Although Tasan and Ricci both separated xing 性 from li and deconstructed the meaning of xing from its connotation of original moral human nature, Tasan’s reconstructed xing is quite different from Ricci’s understanding “nothing other than the fundamental (ben 本) essence (ti 體) of each category of things.” Tasan’s unique contribution is his new definition of xing (K. sŏng) as the appetite or preference/proclivity [for the moral good] (K. kiho, C. shihao 嗜好), which is quite Mencian in its affirmation of the presence of an incipient tendency toward the good in human beings. That he mentions that this xing (K. sŏng), although divested of its a priori metaphysical connotations, is still mandated and bestowed by heaven as stated in the Zhongyong 中庸 [Doctrine of the Mean] further testifies to Tasan’s continued engagement with the classics.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

Although the language of doxa occurs many times in the Gospel of John and is an important concept, there have been not many studies on this subject. Köstenberger’s four categories of this language of doxa give a lot of insight. But his analysis has two weaknesses. First, it does not provide a thorough analysis. Second, it omits the category of the glory of preexistent Logos which is mentioned in this Gospel (17:5a; 17:22; 17:24). Therefore, I supplemented his classification through this study.First, I classified the doxa language of John’s Gospel according to the meaning of this word. The Greek word doxa has two main meanings: the first is “glory” and the second is “honor”, “reputation”, or “opinion.” The former refers to the visible light or brilliance emanating from God’s presence, or to the invisible glory of God through the revelation of his character. John 1:14, 2:11, 11:40, 12:41 belong to this case, and these references mean the divine glory revealed through the character, appearance, and behavior of God or Jesus. In this category, doxa is frequently used with the verb “see.” The second meaning of doxa, “honor,” is often used in the Gospel of John with the words “to take the glory”, “to seek glory,” or “turn glory.” In this category, it refers to the act of receiving praise or exaltation from God or man. There are far more references in this category than in the first category. John 5:41, 5:44 (x2), 7:18 (x2), 8:50, 8:54 (x3), 9:24, 12:43 (x2), 17:4, 17:5a, 17:5b, 17:22, 17:24 fall into this category.Next, I classified the doxa language ​​into the following six categories in terms of its manners that it is expressed. First, in the Gospel of John, the language of doxa is used to refer to Jesus’ glory as a preexisting Logos (17:5a; 17:22; 17:24). Second, it is Jesus’ doxa through the many miracles Jesus performed during his earthly life, including the signs (1:14; 2:11; 11:4; 11:40; 12:28). Third, the events that John describes most in the language of doxa are Jesus’ crucifixion (7:39; 12:16; 12:23; 12:28 (x3); 12:41; 13:31-32 (x5); 17:1 (x2)). Fourth, it is Jesus’ doxa through the Holy Spirit (16:14). Fifth, the doxa of the Father and the Son through the disciples (14:13; 15:8; 17:10; 21:19). Finally, the doxa of human and the doxa of God appear in contrast (5:41; 5:44 (x2); 7:18 (x2); 8:50; 8:54 (x3); 9:24; 12:43 (x2)).",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv
첨성대 이름의 의미 해석,2020,"['도리천(忉利天)', '삼도보계(三道寶階)', '묘탑(廟塔)', '밀교(密敎)', '관정경(灌頂經)']","첨성대의 본질에 관한 현재의 가장 보편적인 가설은 천문관측대설이다. 천문관측설의 근거는 주장하는 학자들마다 약간씩 차이가 있지만, 가장 중요한 근거는 ‘첨성대’라는 이름이며, 이에 대한 타당한 비판은 지금까지 제기된 바가 없다. 본 연구는 ‘첨성대’에 내포된 의미를 밝히고, ‘첨성대’가 천문관측대설의 타당한 근거인지를 살펴보았다.천문관련설은 ‘첨성대’를 주로 ‘첨+성+대’로 해석했다. ‘볼 첨(瞻)’자와 ‘별 성(星)’자와 ‘대 대(臺)’자의 조합인 ‘첨성대’는 ‘천문을 관측한 대’를 뜻한다고 주장해왔다. 한편 종교관련설은 ‘별 성’은 ‘하늘 천(天)’을 의미하며, 첨성대에서 바라본 ‘하늘’은 불교의 천상세계인 도리천이었다고 주장해왔다. 본 연구는 󰡔삼국유사󰡕(1289±) 이전의 중국기록에서 ‘첨성’의 용례들을 살펴보았다. ‘첨성’에 내포된 의미는 매우 다양하게 드러났다. ‘첨성+대’는 서술의 맥락에 따라서 ‘천문을 관측한 대’를 뜻할 수도 있고, ‘도리천을 우러러본 대’를 뜻할 수도 있었다. 또한 ‘첨성’이 힌두교, 유교, 불교, 천주교, 도교와 같은 다양한 종교적 배경으로 실행되었음을 알 수가 있었고, 불교의 ‘첨성’은 적어도 외도(外道)의 ‘첨성’, 법도(法道)의 ‘첨성’, 세속(世俗)의 ‘첨성’으로 나눠질 수가 있음을 알게 되었다. 서술의 맥락에 따라서 ‘첨성+대’에 내포된 의미는 상당히 달라질 수가 있는 것이다.󰡔삼국유사󰡕에 서술된 첨성대의 본질은 선덕여왕의 도리천장례를 위한 묘탑(廟塔)으로 드러났다. 선덕여왕의 도리천장례와 문무왕대의 사천왕사건립은 신종원(1996)의 견해대로 밀교승려 안함(=안홍)에 의해 예언되었고, 󰡔삼국유사󰡕가 인용한 󰡔별기󰡕는 안함(=안홍)의 참서(=예언서)로 드러났다. 선덕여왕릉과 첨성대의 배치가 동지일출선에 정확하게 맞춰져 있음은 첨성대가 선덕여왕 유혼의 도리천 상생통로였기 때문으로 판단되었다. 첨성대는 도리천으로 통하는 삼도보계(三道寶階)와 같은 ‘천국의 계단’를 가진 불탑이었고, ‘첨성대’는 󰡔삼국유사󰡕 왕력편의 ‘점성대’와 마찬가지로 ‘도리천을 우러러본 대’라는 의미로 파악되었다. ‘첨성대’라는 이름은 천문관측대설의 근거가 될 수 없으며, 오히려 천문관련설을 총체적으로 부정할 수 있는 하나의 중요한 근거로 새롭게 평가되어야 마땅할 것이다.","CheomSeongDae(瞻星臺) is a stone structure built in Gyeongju, the former Silla Dynasty capital, during the reign(632~647) of Queen Seondeok. There exist dozens of hypotheses regarding its original purpose. Depending on to whom you ask, the answer could be a celestial observatory, a religious altar, a Buddhist stupa, a monumental tower symbolizing scientific knowledge, and so on. The most common conception of the structure among lay people is a star gazing tower. Historians, however, have suggested that it was a gateway to heavens, specifically the Trāyastriṃśa or the second of the six heavens of Kāmadhātu located on the top of Mountain Sumeru.  The name of Cheom-seong-dae could be interpreted in many different ways. ‘Cheom(瞻)’ could mean looking up, staring, admiring, etc. ‘Seong(星)’ could mean star, heaven, night, etc.; and the heaven can be a physical or religious one. ‘Dae(臺)’ usually refers to a high platform on which people stand or things are placed. Researchers from the science fields often read ‘cheom-seong’ as ‘looking at stars’; while historians read it as ‘admiring the Trāyastriṃśa’ or ‘adoring Śakra’. Śakra is the ruler of Trāyastriṃśa’ and governs the Four Heavenly Kings in the Cāturmahārājika heaven, the first of the six heavens of Kāmadhātu. Śakra is the highest authority of the heavenly kings in direct contacts with humankind. This paper examined the usages of ‘cheom-seong’ in the Chinese literature dated before the publication of 󰡔Samguk Yusa󰡕, a late 13th century Korean Buddhist historical book that contains the oldest record about the structure among all extant historial texts. I found the oldest usage of cheom-seong(瞻星臺) at 󰡔Ekottara Āgama󰡕, a Buddhist script translated into the Chinese in the late 4th century, and surprised to know that its meaning is ‘looking up the brightness left by Śakra’. I also found that ‘cheom-seong’ had been performed in various religious context, such as Hinduism, Confucianism, Buddhist, Christianism, and Taoism. In Buddhism, there were good, bad, neutral cheom-seong. A good cheom-seong is to look up the heaven for practicing asceticism, reading the heavenly god’s intentions, and achieving one mindedness of Buddhism. A bad cheom-seong includes all astrological fortune-telling activities performed outside the boundaries of Buddhism. A neutral cheom-seong is a secular one. It may help people to understand the nature of the physical world, but was considered to have little meaning unless it relates to the spiritual world of Buddhism. Cheom-seong had been performed repetitively in the processes of constructing Buddhist temples in China. According to the Buddhist scripts, Queen Māyā of Sakya, the birth mother of Gautama Buddha, died seven days after the birth of Buddha, and reborn in the Trāyastriṃśa heaven. Buddha, before his nirvana, ascended from Jetavana to Trāyastriṃśa and spent three months together with his mother. Gautama Buddha then returned to the human world stepping on the stairs built by Viśvakarman, the deity of the creative power in Trāyastriṃśa. King Asoka of later years built a stupa at a site where Buddha descended. Since then, people believed the stairway to the heavens appears at a Buddhist stupa. Carefully examining the paragraphic structure of 󰡔Samguk Yusa󰡕’s records on Cheomseongdae, the fact that the alignment between the tomb of Queen Seondeok and Cheomseongdae is perfectly matching with the sunrise direction at the winter solstice, and other historical records, this paper found that Chemseongdae built in the early years of Queen SeonDeok’s reign(632~647) was a gateway to the Trāyastriṃśa heaven just like the stupa at the Daci Temple(慈恩寺) in China built in 654. The meaning of ‘Cheom-seong-dae’ was turned out to be ‘adoring Trāyastriṃśa stupa’, not ‘gazing star platform.’",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

The introduction of the paper briefly describes the life of Padma dBang–rGyal, the author of the root text, and introduces the main commentary and the author of the commentary, Lochen Dharmashri and the second Dudjom Rinpoche. The essence of secret mantra vows is to clean the subtle tendencies and the deluded constructions of the three doors with the non-conceptual wisdom which is the combination of the method and the wisdom. Receiving mantra vows is carried out through the empowerment. The items of the mantra vows are divided into categories of kriyā-tantra, caryā-tantra, yoga-tantra and the highest yoga-tantra. The vows of kriyā-tantra and caryā-tantra is similar to that of the Bodhisattva vows. In the case of the vows of the highest yoga tantra according to Kālacakra tantra, some items which are restricted by the lower vows are permitted. These are permitted in a limited way as a ‘method,’ The items of the secret mantra vows must be understood not on the literal basis but on the basis of the system of the provisional and the ultimate meanings. Finally, How to practice three vows in an individual’s mind stream is discussed. Three vows are consistent with the goal of removing impurity from an individual’s mind stream. There are obvious differences in the three vows, which stem from the disposition and the level of practitioners at each stage.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

This commentary has since become, both in name and reality, the representative commentary on the thoughts contained in the voluminous Huayanjing. Also this commentary became important in the Liao that numerous copies were printed over two rounds at the Hongfa si temple 弘法寺 in the Yanjing region 燕京. The commentaries are on the Huayanjing shu (vols 1–4), Suishuyanyi chao (vols. 1–16)(Xuantan 玄談 vol.8). There are three commentaries on the Huayanjing shu chao, composed by Liao scholar-monks, and among these, one is extant in complete form, the juezĕ ji.The posthumous epithet given to Xianyan that was bestowed on him is fitting given the position that he holds in the history of Liao and Huayan Buddhism. In the study not only of the Liao’s Huayan thought, but also East Asian Huayan thought of the medieval period, several aspects of the philological values of the Juezĕ ji are apparent. The current Juezĕ ji is possibly the only literature that allows an investigation of how the expansion of the Huayan school during the Liao period occurred. The many literatures cited within the Juezĕ ji, by counting and comparing the number of times that certain literatures were cited we can ascertain the composition of the Huayan thought that was current during the Liao period and identify those doctrines that were incorporated. Among the literature cited in the Juezĕ ji, it can be noted that Fazang’s representative compositions and Zongmi’s 宗密(780–841) were often cited. In this way, Fazang and Zongmi allows for a connection from the Liao to the Tang period Buddhism, and more specifically, Tang Huayan thought which can be verified through the citations in the Juezĕ ji.The extant segments of the Juezĕ ji are four copies, the first is Kōsanji copy高山寺本 that considered the most preferred source material, the second is Kanazawa copy金澤寫本, the third is Zōkeishoin copy藏經書院本 that a modern transcribed copy of the Kōsanji copy, the forth is Wanxuzang copy卍續藏本 that a printed copy of the Zōkeishoin copy. This means that the Wanxuzang, Zōkeishoin, and the Kōsanji copies are the same versions. In the precedent studies, I procured and analyzed as paragraphs of 122 to 380 point between the manuscripts of Kanajawa copy and the texts of the Wanxuzang copy (from the second to the sixth volume). And now I also make a comparative study until the second to the sixth volume to add the another typical text, the Zōkyoshoin copy. As a result, it has been added and replaced to modify between the texts of the Wanxuzang copy and the Zōkyoshoin copy that have ranged from scores every single fascicle. In this paper I set them all down in a list and referred to the overall points and the one significant abnormality. Thus I sought to introduce the results of comparative studies for the intertextuality of the firth volume to the sixth volume.

Buddhism begins with saddhā(信) which means trust, and ends with wisdom which means paññā(般若). Saddhā is necessary for vimutti(解脫) in early Buddhism. In Generally in Buddism, ""belief"" is saddhā. In this paper we aim to distinguish saddhā to clarify its precise meaning between amūlikā saddhā and ākāravati saddhā. According to Caṅkīsutta, amūlikā saddhā means a blind belief without criticism. By Vīmaṃsakasutta, ākāravati saddhā means a reasonable belief that admits the quest. Ākāravati saddhā is regarded as intellectual criticism work. ‘Bhatti’ is a religious belief that recognizes transcendental existence. Bhatti is due to fear, iti emphasizs absolute belief. It is distinguished from ākāravati saddhā and bhatti.In the previous study, based on Kesaputtiyasutta, Buddhism has been regarded as a teaching that emphasized freedom of thought rather than trust. But believing in the existence and words of Buddha is the premise of saddhā. Ākāravati saddhā, a belief emphasized in early Buddhism, is closely related to freedom of thought and theory of the knowledge. In order to understand correctly saddhā in Buddhism, it is necessary to accompany free exploration and criticism of the object of faith, the possibility of refusal, the possibility of falsification in Kesaputtiyasutta, Vīmaṃsakasutta. Most of the discussions this saddhā are discussed in relation to ñāṇa in Pāli-Nikāya.Buddha refuses blind beliefs without verification and extravagant belief by the authority of the teacher and emphasizes ākāravati saddhā that arises after his intellectual criticism work. In early Buddhism we refuse amūlikā saddhā which we just believe without quest. We take ākāravati saddhā which is a belief in a rational character. Ākāravati saddhā is a belief justified by quest. Through such ākāravati saddhā with ñāṇa, it leads to vimutti, the ultimate goal of Buddhism.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

Lazy Learning for Nonparametric Locally Weighted Regression,2020,"['k-nearest neighbors', 'Locally weighted regression', 'Weighted least square estimation', 'Lazy learning', 'Fuzzy C-means clustering']",,"In this study, a newly designed local model called locally weighted regression model is proposed for the regression problem. This model predicts the output for a newly submitted data point. In general, the local regression model focuses on an area of the input space specified by a certain kernel function (Gaussian function, in particular). The local area is defined as a region enclosed by a neighborhood of the given query point. The weights assigned to the local area are determined by the related entries of the partition matrix originating from the fuzzy C-means method.

Fused clustering mean estimation of central subspace,2020,['Clustering mean method · Fused estimation · Informative predictor subspace · K-means clustering · Sufficient dimension reduction'],,"Recently, Yoo (Statistics 50:1086–1099, 2016) newly defines an informative predictor subspace to contain the central subspace. The method to estimate the informative predictor subspace does not require any of the conditions assumed to hold in usual sufficient dimension reductionmethodologies.However, like sliced inverse regression (Li in J Am Stat Assoc 86:316–342, 1991) and sliced average variance estimation (Cook and Weisberg in J Am Stat Assoc 86:328–332, 1991), its non-asymptotic behavior in the estimation is sensitive to the choices of the categorization of the predictors and response. The paper develops an estimation approach that is robust to the categorization choices. For this, sample kernel matrices are combined in two ways.

IA는기업보험(non-consumer insurance)에 있어서 위험정보에 관한 고지의무(the duty of disclosure)에 대해 규정하고 있다. 본 논문은 고지의무의 요건 및 효과를 개관하고, 특히 보험계약자 및 보험자의 주관적 요건에 초점을 두고 살펴보고자 한다. 여기서 주관적 요건은 보험계약자 및 보험자의 인식(knowledge)의문제로서 고지의무의 범위를 정하는 중요한 요소이다. 이는 보험계약자와 보험자의 이해관계를 조정하여 균형 있게 정해져야 할 사항이다. 우리나라에서 고지의무(상법 651조)의 주관적 요건에 대한 심층적 연구는 아직 충분하지 않은 단계이다. IA가 규정하는 고지의무의 주관적 요건에 대한 연구를 통해서 해석론및 입법론에 관련된 시사점을 얻을 수 있다. IA에 따른 고지의무의 주관적 요건의 구체적 내용과 우리 법에 대한 시사점은 다음과 같다.먼저, 보험계약자의 주관적 요건을 본다. 첫째, IA는 보험계약자의 주관적 요건을 보다 구체적으로 규정하여 법적 불확실성을 제거한 측면이 있다. IA는 보험계약자가 아는 것이 구체적으로 누가 아는 것을 의미하는지에 대해 규정하고있다. 이는 우리 상법의 해석에 고려할 수 있다. 특히 보험계약자가 개인이 아닌 단체인 경우에 그러한 규정은 참고의 필요성이 크다. 또한 이는 향후 우리상법의 개정 시에 반영을 고려해볼 사항이다. 둘째, 보험계약자의 주관적 요건을 축소하거나 확대한 측면도 있다. 이 중에서 주관적 요건의 확대는 합리적 검색의 요건을 도입한 것을 가리키는데, 이에 의해서 보험계약자가 알아야 하는사항의 범위가 확대되었고 보험계약자의 부담이 커졌다고 보는 것이 중론이다.합리적 검색의 요건은 우리 상법 651조의 해석에는 고려하기 어렵고, 향후 우리상법의 개정 시에 이를 도입하는 데에도 신중을 기할 필요가 있다.다음, 보험자의 주관적 요건을 보면, 이는 기본적으로 기존에 비해 크게 달라지지 않았다. 보험계약자의 주관적 요건이 크게 확대된 것과 비교할 때 보험자의 주관적 요건의 확대는 상대적으로 경미하여 결과적으로 양자의 균형이 깨진측면이 있다. IA는 보험자의 주관적 요건을 보험자가 아는 것, 보험자가 알아야하는 것, 보험자가 안다고 간주되는 것으로 구분하여 상세히 규정하고 있다. 상당한 변화는 IA 5조 2항⒝가 보험자가 보유한 정보로서 용이하게 이용가능한정보라면 이를 보험자가 알아야 하는 사항에 포함시킨 점이다.

IA prescribes the insuredˈs duty of disclosure regarding risks in the area of non-consumer insurance. This article particularly focuses on how the knowledge of the insured and the insurer act as subjective requirements for the duty of disclosure. As these requirements are significant factors limiting the scope of the duty of disclosure, it is important to strike a fair balance between the interests of the insured and the insurer. Research has rarely been made on the subjective requirements for the duty of disclosure in the Korean Commercial Code Sec. 651. This study of IA may draw meaningful implications for the interpretation and reform of the Korean Commercial Code Sec. 651.The knowledge of the insured has two interesting aspects. First, IA reduces legal uncertainties by defining the insuredˈs knowledge in more detail. IA stipulates whose knowledge is to be understood as the insuredˈs knowledge especially when the insured is not an individual. This rule may be worth consulting in interpreting and reforming the Korean Commercial Code Sec. 651. Second, IA either narrows down or broadens the scope of the insuredˈs knowledge. The latter indicates the introduction of reasonable search. This means that the insured ought to know what should reasonably have been revealed by a reasonable search of information available to the insured. It is widely recognized that the requirement of reasonable search places a heavy burden on the insured as it expands the range of information for disclosure. The requirement of reasonable search is difficult to refer to in interpreting the Korean Commercial Code sec. 651 which forbids the insured’s fraudulent or grossly negligent disclosure. It would also be doubtful at this stage to introduce the concept of reasonable search into the Korean Commercial Code Regarding the insurerˈs knowledge, there have been no significant changes. IA stipulates in detail about the insurerˈs knowledge dividing it into what the insure knows, what the insurer ought to know, and what the insurer is presumed to know. A notable change is that IA sec. 5 subsec. 2 ⒝ includes readily available and relevant information held by the insurer into what the insurer ought to know. This rule may be worth consulting in interpreting and reforming the Korean Commercial Code sec. 651.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

But the best is in this present life to be directly a ‘Arhat’ or ‘jīvanmukti’, not to get away from further transmigration of souls. In this sense, vipassanā disciplinant, Mogok's teaching about nirvāṇa and saṁsāra in ‘present’' is meaningful.Based on  understanding of  ‘12 paṭiccasamuppāda(conditioned co-production)’, he said one life cycle in every moment of life, as well as common meaning of it. He said  depending on processing vedanā(sense), nirvana and cycle is divided. To recognize that anicca(evanescent) of vedanā(sensation) arising by phassa(mental contect), that moment is the nirvana.

Genome-wide insights of Ethiopian indigenous sheep populations reveal the population structure related to tail morphology and phylogeography,2020,['Fat-tail\xa0· Genetic diversity\xa0· Ovine 50\xa0K SNP\xa0· Population structure'],,"Background Ethiopian sheep living in diferent climatic zones and having contrasting morphologies are a most promising subject of molecular-genetic research. Elucidating their genetic diversity and genetic structure is critical for designing appropriate breeding and conservation strategies. Objective The study was aimed to investigate genome-wide genetic diversity and population structure of eight Ethiopian sheep populations. Methods A total of 115 blood samples were collected from four Ethiopian sheep populations that include Washera, Farta and Wollo (short fat-tailed) and Horro (long fat-tailed). DNA was extracted using Quick-DNA™ Miniprep plus kit. All DNA samples were genotyped using Ovine 50 K SNP BeadChip. To infer genetic relationships of Ethiopian sheep at national, continental and global levels, genotype data on four Ethiopian sheep (Adilo, Arsi-Bale, Menz and Black Head Somali) and sheep from east, north, and south Africa, Middle East and Asia were included in the study as reference. Results Mean genetic diversity of Ethiopian sheep populations ranged from 0.352±0.14 for Horro to 0.379±0.14 for ArsiBale sheep. Population structure and principal component analyses of the eight Ethiopian indigenous sheep revealed four distinct genetic cluster groups according to their tail phenotype and geographical distribution. The short fat-tailed sheep did not represent one genetic cluster group. Ethiopian fat-rump sheep share a common genetic background with the Kenyan fat-tailed sheep. Conclusion The results of the present study revealed the principal component and population structure follows a clear pattern of tail morphology and phylogeography.

A Study on Ch’oe Ch’iwǒn’s Literary Reputation and Its Grounds,2020,"['Ch’oe Ch’iw?n', 'Tongguk Munjong', 'Ky?k Hwang So s?', 'Kyew?n p’ilgy?ngjip', 'Tongmuns?n', '최치원', '동국문종', '계원필경집', '격황소서', '문창후', '교유']","최치원은 우리 학계에서 한문학의 鼻祖, 東國文宗 등으로 평가된다. 현전 문집 중 가장 오래된 《계원필경집》을 남겼다는 점, 〈격황소서〉로 공을 세웠다는 점, 《계원필경집》이 《唐書》 〈藝文志〉에 기록되어 있다는 점 등이 그러한 평가의 근거로 언급되어 왔다. 본고에서는 이에 더하여 최치원의 문학적 능력이 실제로 뛰어났는지, 그리고 과거역사에서는 최치원과 그의 능력을 어떻게 평가했는지를, 그동안 크게 주목하지 않았던 관련 자료를 살펴봄으로써, 동국문종이란 명성의 근거를 확인해보고자 하였다. 그 결과는 다음과 같다. 첫째, 당나라의 공식 史書인 《당서》 〈예문지〉에 《계원필경집》이 언급되었다는 것은 《계원필경집》의 수준이 사서에 등재할 만큼 가치가 있었다는 의미로 볼 수 있다. 그런데 《당서》 〈예문지〉에는 《계원필경집》 뿐만 아니라 《四六》 1권이 더 언급되어 있고, 《宋史》에는 그 《사륙》 1권을 《別集》 1권으로 지칭하고 있다. 중요한 점은 이 《사륙》집이 최치원이 헌강왕에게 바쳤던, 그러나 지금은 존재하지 않는 《중산복궤집》의 일부로 추정된다는 점이다. 이점은 《당서》, 《송사》가 편찬될 시기에 중국 학자들은 최치원의 여러 저술들을 주목했다는 의미를 지닌다. 둘째, 최치원이 唐에 있을 때 교유한 杜筍學, 羅隱, 顧雲 등은 당나라 말기의 시단을 대표하는 문인들인데, 이 중 두순학과 나은은 최치원에게 시를 지어 주면서 서로 우호적인 교유를 하였고, 고운은 ‘문장으로 중국을 감동시켰다’는 말로 최치원의 뛰어난 문학적 능력을 직접적으로 칭송한 바 있다. 셋째, 최치원이 귀국했을 때 헌강왕은 그를 ‘國士’로 대접해 주었고, 진성여왕은 최치원에게 고승들의 碑銘을 짓게 했다. 나라의 선생으로 인정해 주고 또 엄정한 글쓰기가 요구되는 碑銘 쓰기를 맡겼다는 것은 당시 왕들이 최치원의 詩文 능력을 높이 평가했다는 뜻이다. 넷째, 삼국사기와 新羅古記를 보면, 신라의 삼국통일에 있어서 武功으로는 김춘추, 문장으로는 强首가 으뜸이라고 하였다. 그런데도 고려 顯宗은 신라인들 중에 강수가 아닌 최치원을 文昌侯에 봉했다. 다섯째, 조선시대에 《계원필경집》은 史庫에 보관되었고, 또 冊板이 유실되었을 때에는 복각을 하는 등 매우 귀중한 문집으로 취급되었다. 이것은 《계원필경집》이 最古의 문집이자 전범으로서의 위상을 지녔기 때문이다. 위의 근거들로 볼 때, 우리는 ‘최치원=동국문종’이란 등식이 사실에 부합하는 평가임을 알 수 있다.","This study examines Ch’oe Ch’iwǒn’s path to becoming “Tongguk Munjong,” or patriarch of literature. After returning to Silla from Tang, Ch’oe compiled his writings into various anthologies and collections of poems. Some of these collected works were recorded in Xin Tang Shu. The fact that the work of Ch’oe, a foreigner from Silla, was recorded in the Tang dynasty’s history book meant that Ch’oe’s literary ability and the quality of his collected works were very highly regarded. While studying and holding an official position in Tang, Ch’oe socialized with exceptional poets, who spoke highly of Ch’oe in their works. Among Tang poets, Du Sunhe, Luo Yin, Gu Yin, Gao Pian, and Zhang Qiao particularly highly valued Ch’oe’s literary ability. The Korean records show that Ch’oe primarily gained his fame in Tang with the publication of Kyǒk Hwang So sǒ. This fact was first found out by Yi Kyubo. Yi recorded that Ch’oe had shivered Hwang So with Kyǒk Hwang So sǒ. Since then, Kyǒk Hwang So sǒ has become a work that symbolizes the high literary fame and status of Ch’oe. Kyewǒn p’ilgyǒngjip also played an important role in qualifying Ch’oe as Tongguk Munjong. Most of his writings in Kyewǒn p’ilgyǒngjip were included again in Tongmunsǒn because the writings in Kyewǒn p’ilgyǒngjip gained textbook-like status in Korean literature written in Chinese.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

The goal of this work is to better understand room acoustics conditions for real speech communication during actual lectures and to provide U50 values for achieving ‘good’ acoustical conditions for speech intelligibility in university classrooms. In the present work, U50 is determined from both measured C50 and SNR values during 15 actual lectures in 11 university classrooms in Korea. The linear regression results for speech transmission index (STI) and U50 values show that classrooms having U50 values greater than +4.1 ㏈ correspond to STI values of 0.60, indicating ‘Good’ acoustical conditions for speech intelligibility. The U50 value is 0.9 ㏈ lower than that of the previous study made in quietly occupied classrooms without student activities. The present result indicates that the noise level is not the same as experienced during actual lecturing situations in university classrooms. When the classroom has a SNR (125-4k) value of 7.7 ㏈ or lower a C50 (125-4k) value of 7.3 ㏈ or greater to be required for achieving good acoustical conditions during lectures in university classrooms.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

Mainland China is a complex distribution of languages belonging to various language families, such as the Sino-Tibetan languages, Kra-Dai languages, Austronesian languages, Austroasiatic languages, and Altaic languages. Since they have strong linguistic contacts over a long period of time, the study of language typology in mainland China has a very important meaning not only for the study of Chinese but also for the study of world language typology.  First of all, this paper compares and analyzes the classification of Chinese dialect area in the preceding studies to reconsider the criteria and methods for classifying language typology in Chinese dialect area, and discusses the need for subdividing Mandarin dialects and adding other ethnic languages.

To examine how the noodles are implicated in poems and the meaning that poets try to say through eating behaviors, Bourdieu and Deleuze’s discussions were referenced. Bourdieu said food is a mechanism that creates and recreates the sexism and Deleuze suggested rhizome or becoming- that would reinforce physical literacy to get out of this dominant system. Rhizome is a method of dissolving hierarchical aggregate and drawing the line of flight of molecular creation, and it is presented in female poems by relating to the noodles.In some female poems, food is materialized into jjajangmyeon (black bean sauce noodles), fried noodles, kalguksu (knife-cut noodles) and noodles, and eating the food is performed when consciousness is broken. Therefore, it may result in failure (CHOI, J.R), meeting strangers (HEO, S.K), arriving at an ambiguous state (JEONG, G.B), or result in spilling the food (LEE, G.H). During the process, a landscape of strange road-noodle is unfolded where bodies are mixed with past and present, myth and mundane world, and life and death, where ego is mixed with others, and where countless others are co-existed. Poets try to commune with others in that boundary. At this moment, road-noodle functions as a type of the line of flight to run away from the oppressive reality, and refuses colonization of malesㆍcapital while simultaneously shows poets’ ethical spirit of resistance who seek to share and communicate.On the other hand, an opposition between eating and being eaten sometimes releases destructive energy in poems. Preference of food that is materialized into ramen, noodle strips, spaghetti is mixed with other different series to function to shake the split line of binary opposition violently. That is the branch where history and civilization meet (SHIN, H.J), chunk of dough (KIM, S.W), red motorway (KIM H.S), face of others (LEE W). Eating by these cannibalistic subjects is different from eating by masculine subjects that make others to return to the coordinate of identity, it stays in a gap between ego and others, showing a movement that opposes subjectivation. As this movement is a poetic energy that creates new body and birth of sense, it shows political esthetics that females, as a minority who causes a rift in the senses of group, write poems.In female poems, the noodles response to the capital, nation, reason, and logic of rationality that capture individual lives into a fixed circuit while simultaneously function as a type of the line of flight to escape from hierarchical authority. It has significances in that it shows an opportunity of birth of new life after getting out of the major and dominant flow while simultaneously looks back the eating-being eaten method that preserves lives.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

We compared the persistence of NOAC and VKA treatment for AF in real-world practice.Methods: In a prospective observational registry (COmparison study of Drugs for symptom control and complication prEvention of Atrial Fibrillation [CODE-AF] registry), 7,013 patients with nonvalvular AF (mean age 67.2 ± 10.9 years, women 36.4%) were consecutively enrolled between June 2016 and June 2017 from 10 tertiary hospitals in Korea. This study included 3,381 patients who started OAC 30 days before enrollment (maintenance group) and 572 patients who newly started OAC (new-starter group). The persistence rate of OAC was evaluated.Results: In the maintenance group, persistence to OAC declined during 6 months, to 88.3% for VKA and 95.5% for NOAC (p < 0.0001). However, the persistence rate was not different among NOACs. In the new-starter group, persistence to OAC declined during 6 months, to 78.9% for VKA and 92.1% for NOAC (p < 0.0001). The persistence rate was lower for rivaroxaban (83.7%) than apixaban (94.6%) and edoxaban (94.1%, p < 0.001). In the new-starter group, diabetes, valve disease, and cancer were related to nonpersistence of OAC.Conclusions: Nonpersistence was significantly lower with NOAC than VKA in both the maintenance and new-starter groups. In only the new-starter group, apixaban or edoxaban showed higher persistence rates than rivaroxaban.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

And the characteristic of the dharmatā is defined as the manifestation of tathatā, which means the state where the untrue discrimination has disappeared. At this time, Vasubandhu explains that the dharmatā is characterized by the concept of parāvṛtti (or parivṛtti).Taking the expression 'transformation of āśraya' literally, what is the meaning of the āśraya? In this text, the āśraya of the dharma goes beyond the meaning of the body, mind, and personality of the practitioner. It also includes the external environment of the world. The āśraya of dharmatā is explained as with the sarvadharma and the all sūtra piṭaka. This transformation transmutation is firstly acquired on the darśana-mārga, and finally fully accomplished through the bhāvanā-mārga. On this point, it has a similarity with the Mahāyānasūtrālaṃkāra.We can also confirm the affinity with the Ratnagotravibhāga, on the point of dividing tathatā into samala and nirmala. The position of Vasubandhu, interpreting the metaphor of the ākāśa, is also in line with the tathāgatagarbha, which suggests there is no real change in the āśraya-parivṛtti.

Thus, comparing and examining this concept with the representative works of the two traditions, Mūlamadhyamaka-kārikā (MMK) and Brahma-sūtra-bhāṣya (BSB), will be useful for a better understanding of the methodology of Liberation, or the logic of Liberation, that penetrate each ontology and performance theory.First of all, while prapañca maintains its etymological meaning ‘to make clear by spreading or stretching, to say in detail, to cheat or distort’, it refers to in MMK all the linguistic and conceptual processes that mean ‘linguistic proliferation’, and in BSB the phenomenal world or the world of extension. Prapañca also has philosophical connotations such as ‘① spreading or proliferation, ② illusion or delusion, ③ obstruction’ in each system. From this, it is understood that prapañca is secondary, pointing to what is proliferated and what is delusional and what is obstructive in the primary ‘something’. In MMK, if the primary thing is phenomena of dependent origination, the secondary prapañca is the world of language that operates around conceptualization. In BSB, if the primary thing is Pure Consciousness or Ātman, the secondary prapañca is a psychological and physical world that works around epistemological ignorance. Even though the secondary prapañca creates a situation of bondage by distorting or concealing the primary prapañca, in a perspective that a return to the primary can be achieved only through that secondary, MMK and BSB have no choice but to use the ‘methodology of negation’. The way to deny or annihilate the secondary, that is a sort of deception or falsehood, is to break away from the ‘hypostatization’ of language in the case of Buddhism and, in the case of Vedānta, break away from the ‘objectification’ of ignorance. Through self-awareness of emptiness in the case of Buddhism and through the generation of knowledge in the case of Vedānta, if the secondary prapañca is negated or annihilated respectively, it is finally possible to recover the primary prapañca or liberation.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

Whereas the obligation to such a r egistration i s classified i n to two k inds o f duty, n amely pre-existent obligatory and proprietary duty, some Supreme Court decisions have conferred such an obligation and a corresponding right on parties who have not yet engaged in a pre-existent either obligatory or a proprietary relationship in the case where the corresponding right holder has a right against a third party to request performance and the debtor keeps invalid registration which hampers the realization of a third party’s obligation. Since conferring such an obligation on a party against the other party who has not yet engaged in a pre-existent legal relationship with the named debtor means acknowledging a kind of third party effect to the other party’s obligatory right to the third party, the related Supreme Court decisions have to be analysed to either back up or criticize. The purpose of this paper is to ascertain whether the obligation to register in the unmovable property registry is to be characterized as a duty by the debtor to reverse unjust en richment, i f the debtor w ho k eeps i n valid registration hampers t he r ealization of the creditor’s obligatory right against the third party without any legal justification and the obligation is the only way to rescue the creditor’s hampered obligatory right.This research was triggered by the controversial Supreme Court decision dated on 9th March 2017, 2015DA21798 among civil law scholars. But this paper reveals there have been many other Supreme Court decisions of the same characterization This paper argues that either creditors who have revoked a fraudulent transaction by a debtor or other creditors who can benefit from the revocation and restoration in accordance with Article 407 of Korean Civil Code are eligible to request any third party who keeps invalid registration by virtue of an invalid transaction with the said debtor holding an apparent right caused by revocation and restoration to delete invalid registration in the unmovable property registry to the effect that the restored property shall be subject to seizure by creditors in accordance with Article 407 of Korean Civil Code and that such an obligation by the debtor with invalid registration is to be deemed as a duty to reverse unjust enrichment, otherwise the creditors right which is allocated and guaranteed by that provision cannot be realized. In addition, this paper critically analyzed other Supreme Court decisions, which conferred an obligation to reverse unjust enrichment on a party who has not yet engaged in pre-existent either obligatory or proprietary relationship against the other party who has an obligatory right against a third party, and which cannot be classified as a unjust en richment case.

For this purpose, this article examined the Chinese language notes of the time based on the period of Song(宋), which is reflected in So, Ong(邵雍), and what principles were used to write down the Goryeo language. The actual translated patterns were examined according to the internal order of Gyerimyusa, and the transcription patterns of substantives, predicates, or sentences. As a result, substantives are usually transferred in a single form, which reflects the simplification of the word /h/ or consonant group. In the predicates or sentence, only one word(upper root) is divided into two types: transcription (amplification, command, origin, questioning), three-way transcription, and quadrupole transcription. It is difficult to decipher when transcribed in the same Chinese characters as the heading clause. The Gyerimyusa seems to have more function of indicating meaning than previously pointed out with the characteristic features of Chinese characters. This may result in the selection of the best transcription and the selection of the next best phonograph. Finally, depending on the phonological characteristics of the Chinese language, it can be seen that the consonant and vowel positions are the same or great in the next syllable transcription, as well as the link between the consonant and the vowel.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv
가로림만 표층 퇴적물 내 미량금속 분포 특성,2020,"['Trace metals', 'Sediments', 'Garolim Bay', 'Enrichment factor', 'Leached fraction']",,"In 2010 and 2015, total 77 surface sediment samples were collected to assess the anthropogenic effects of trace metals in surface sediments of Garolim Bay, and the physical characteristics (particle size and specific surface area) and geochemical components (major (Al, Ca, Fe, K, Ba) and trace metals (Mn, Cs, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb), organic carbon and calcium carbonate) were analyzed. Mean grain size of Garolim Bay surface sediments ranged from 0.51-5.58 Ø (mean 3.98 Ø) and increased from the inlet of bay to the inner bay, and from the waterway to the land. Most of the metal concentrations except for some elements showed the similar distribution to those of mean grain size and specific surface area. As the particle size decreased and the specific surface area increased, the metal concentration increased. In order to estimate the factors controlling the concentration of trace metals, factor analysis was performed, and three factors were extracted (92.7% of the total variation). Factor 1 accounted for 71.3% of the total variation, which was a grain size factor. Factor 2 accounted for 14.2% of the total variation, Factor 3 accounted for 7.2% of the total variance. Enrichment factor was calculated using the particle size corrected background concentration. Metals with a enrichment factor of 1.5 or higher and the number of samples were 4 for Cr (St. 1, 16, 27, 39) and 1 for Pb (St. 39), but there were little differences in the concentrations of 1M HCl leached metals for these metals. The percentage of 1M HCl leached fraction to total metal concentration decreased in the order of Pb~Co>Cu>Zn~Mn>Ni>Cr. Comparing this value with contaminated and clean sediments in other coastal areas, the percentages for each metal were similar regardless of the trace metal levels in all regions. This fact might be resulted from the reaction between the 1M HCl solution and the different sediment constituents, indicating that there is a limit to apply this percentage of leached metal to the estimation of the contamination extent.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv
Investigating the Au-Cu thick layers Electrodeposition Rate with Pulsed Current by Optimization of the Operation Condition,2020,"['Alloy Electrode position', 'Au-Cu Bath Composition', 'Average Current Density', 'Optimization of Deposition Rate', 'Duty Cycle', 'Formation of Layers and Gold Percentage']",,"The impact of effective parameters on the electrodeposition rate optimization of Au-Cu alloy at high thicknesses on the silver substrate was investigated in the present study. After ensuring the formation of gold alloy deposits with the desired and standard percentage of gold with the cartage of 18K and other standard karats that should be observed in the manufacturing of the gold and jewelry artifacts, comparing the rate of gold-copper deposition by direct and pulsed current was done. The rate of deposition with pulse current was significantly higher than direct current. In this process, the duty cycle parameter was effectively optimized by the ""one factor at a time"" method to achieve maximum deposition rate. Particular parameters in this work were direct and pulse current densities, bath temperature, concentration of gold and cyanide ions in electrolyte, pH, agitation and wetting agent additive. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and surface chemical analysis system (EDS) were used to study the effect of deposition on the cross-sections of the formed layers. The results revealed that the Au-Cu alloy layer formed with concentrations of 6gr·L<sup>-1</sup> Au, 55gr·L<sup>-1</sup> Cu, 24 gr·L<sup>-1</sup> KCN and 1 ml·L<sup>-1</sup> Lauryl dimethyl amine oxide (LDAO) in the 0.6 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup> average current density and 30% duty cycle, had 0.841 ㎛·min<sup>-1</sup> Which was the highest deposition rate. The use of electrodeposition of pure and alloy gold thick layers as a production method can reduce the use of gold metal in the production of hallow gold artifacts, create sophisticated and unique models, and diversify production by maintaining standard karats, hardness, thickness and mechanical strength. This will not only make the process economical, it will also provide significant added value to the gold artifacts. By pulsating of currents and increasing the duty cycle means reducing the pulse off-time, and if the pulse off-time becomes too short, the electric double layer would not have sufficient growth time, and its thickness decreases. These results show the effect of pulsed current on increasing the electrodeposition rate of Au-Cu alloy confirming the previous studies on the effect of pulsed current on increasing the deposition rate of Au-Cu alloy.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

Regression Model to Predict Nitrogen Mineralization Using Soil Parameters for Pepper Upland,2020,"['Nitrogen', 'Mineralization model', 'Upland soils']",,"One of the most important practices for nitrogen (N) management in arable lands is to minimize N loss using soil-customized N supply. Despite that N mineralization of soils is an useful parameter to manage N fertilization, it requires a lot of analysis. To predict N mineralization rate of upland soils, we performed regression analysis between N mineralization parameters (Mineralized N, N0, k) and soil properties. Experimental soils were randomly sampled from 40 pepper cultivation fields before fertilization. The rate of soil N mineralization was analyzed through incubation for 16 weeks at 27℃. N mineralization parameters of soils were estimated from first-order kinetic model, and a stepwise regression was conducted to predict the mineralized N, N0 and k using soil properties. Mineralized N was linearly correlated with EC (R²=0.745) which meant a good indicator to predict N mineralization rate. N0 as potentially mineralizable N was positively correlated with soil organic matter (SOM) and total N, and those represented a linear relationship (y=0.0682x, R²=0.729). SOM, sand, clay and C/N ratio were selected as parameters for prediction of N0 (R²=0.448). In addition, a regression equation for estimation of k was composed of EC, CEC, sand and clay (R²=0.508). In conclusion, we suggest that N mineralization rate by combination with soil properties could be determined with a regression equation. However, model equation represented in this study should be validated and improved through field experiments with different levels of N application and different types of soil property.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

This study tested whether ewes (Ovis aries) exposed to water deprivation and thermal–humidity stressors had altered mineral footprints in their wool, serum, urine, and feces.Methods: Nine ewes (age = 3 years; mean body weight = 41±3.5 kg) were divided among a control group with free access to water, and treatment groups with water deprivation lasting either 2 h (2hWD) or 3 h (3hWD) after feeding. Using a 3×3 Latin square design, animals were assigned to treatment groups for three sampling periods of 21 days each (n = 9). Blood was collected by jugular venipuncture. Wool was collected at the end of periods 2 and 3. Metabolic crates designed with metal grated floors were used for urine and feces collection. We measured sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), phosphorus (P), chloride (Cl), calcium (Ca), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn).Results: The wool mineral levels did not differ between the treatment groups, although K was marginally lower (p = 0.10) in the 2hWD group. The serum and urine mineral levels did not differ between the treatments (p>0.05). Fecal K was significantly lower in the 2hWD group than in the other groups (p≤0.05).Conclusion: In conclusion, water deprivation and thermal-humidity exposure altered the excretion of K, but not of other minerals, in the wool, urine, feces, or serum of ewes.

Fifteen weather stations were installed under each agrivoltaic to measure solar radiation and temperature, and yield and yield-related elements were investigated by points. The accumulated solar radiation during the rice growing season in fixing was no much difference between points, and that in tracing was much difference between points. However, the average solar radiations of two agrivoltaics were similar. The mean temperature, yield, and yield-related elements showed a significant difference for the shading rate, and decreased with increasing the shading rate except ripening grain rate and 1000 grain weight of fixing agrivoltaic. In the relationship between shading rate and yield, fixing and tracing were fitted to a logistic equation and a simple linear equation, respectively, and showed a high correlation (tracing: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.62, fixing: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.73).

Thermoplastic composite tubes with various length (40 mm and 80 mm) and fiber yarn orientation with respective tolengthwise (0 o/90 o, 15 o/75 o, 30 o/60 o and 45 o/45 o) were manufactured by pultrusion and welding from home-made woven glass fabric/PP prepreg sheets. Quasi-static axial compressive tests of the composite tubes were performed under various temperatures (298 K, 358 K, 398 K and 453 K). Three crushing modes were observed: progressive folding, splaying and weld seam cracking. The influence of fiber orientation, tube length-diameter ratio and testing temperature on the peak load, mean load, specific energy absorption and crush efficiency were investigated. The results show that the peak load is controlled by fiber orientation and testing temperature. The mean force, specific energy absorption and crush efficiency are related to the three mentioned factors. Both fiber orientation and testing temperature have obviously influence on crushing modes of thermoplastic composite tubes. Length-to-diameter ratio also plays a role in crushing modes when the testing temperature is higher than the melting point of the resin.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

The unit of headwords includes both smaller and larger units: from morphemes such as affixes, particles, endings to sentences such as famous quotes, and old sayings. It encompasses all the possible units suitable as an entry of a dictionary. Out of 440K headwords from the Joseonmal Unabridged Dictionary, only the noun has increased its proportion in the ratio of headwords based on lexical categories, compared to its first edition. The North Korea attempted to revise word notations for ‘am- (female), su- (male)’ in ‘Choseonmal Regulations’ (2010). As a normative dictionary, the Joseonmal Unabridged Dictionary also reflected this trend in its headwords, resulting in the different word notations for two Koreas. On the other hand, there were cases where the wording and meaning of words from two Koreas became identical. The macrostructure of Joseonmal Unabridged Dictionary has developed by articulately selecting adverb entries and supplementing the grammatical morpheme lists known as ‘To(토)’.

Why Do We Overlap Each Other?: Collaborative Overlapping Talk in English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) Communication,2020,"['English as a lingua franca', 'turn-taking', 'overlaps', 'involvement', 'cooperation']",,"Overlap is often considered as a breakdown of the one-at-a-time principle in conversational turn-taking and something to be resolved. However, in English as a lingua franca (ELF) interaction, the speakers are found to endeavour to achieve cooperative and supportive turn-taking and turn-management through a dynamic use of overlapping talk. This study aims to explore how the international students in the U.K university employ the interactional dynamics of overlap as a resource for co-constructing meanings and joint accomplishment of turn-taking by analysing naturally occurring ELF interactions with Conversation Analysis (CA). The findings reveal that the participants produced a high frequency of overlapping talk in interaction, and particularly overlaps occurred when the speakers made a backchannel, echoing response, and utterance completion. A delayed response or turn transition may cause a violation of turn-taking in conversation, and consequently the speakers attempt to provide frequent and timely responses, which may lead to the high frequency of overlaps and simultaneous talk. As a turn-switch between speakers is not completely smooth, and overlapping talk is an inevitable outcome of dynamic and collaborative turn-taking practices, classroom teaching needs to encourage English language learners to use more adaptive pragmatic strategies such as repair, accommodation, or clarification request when overlaps cause communicative problems.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

For that reason, this study was to analyze the effects of customary exercise on the olfactory function such as olfactory perception and threshould with physical and mental functions in older females. A total of 32 older females(mean age: 79.6±3.3 years) were participated in this study, and they were divided into control(n=15; mean age: 80.8±4.0 years) and exercise groups(n=17; mean age: 78.5±2.2 years). In the case of exercise group, they regularly performed the exercise such as swimming, aerobics or magic tennis, but control group mainly adhered sedentary lifestyle except for visiting senior citizen center. There were statistically significant differences in visceral fat area, percentage of abdominal fat, shoulder flexibility, timed up and go test(TUG) value and geriatric depression scale short form-K(GDSSF-K) score between control and exercise groups, respectively(p＜.05), suggesting the physical and mental health-promoting effects by the regular exercise in our elderly subjects. With respect to olfactory function, although slightly better performances of olfactory perception and threshould were detected in exercise group, there were no statistically significant improvement of both olfactory function dimensions in exercise group. In the case of older females, the olfactory function including olfactory perception and threshould might not significantly be influenced by the performance of regular exercise. Therefore, further studies using larger sample size behind more sophisticated study design will be required in order to clarify the precise relationship between the performance of regular exercise and sensory system functions including olfactory function in older peoples.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

Methods : This study developed a board game through basic survey and data analysis until October 2020, targeting two elderly people aged 65 years or older in Jeju-si. After a total of 13 times, MoCA-K and GDS-K were used before and after evaluation to feel overall cognitive function and depression. Results : Through consultation with occupational therapy professors and clinicians, 40 ADL elements were selected and the rules of the board game were created. In both subjects A and B, the results of the intervention period were higher than the mean ±2 standard deviation band of the 3 baseline sessions after they played the developed board game. In addition, the score of MoCA-K increased after the intervention compared to before the intervention, and the score of GDS-K decreased, leading to an increase in cognitive function and decrease in depression. Conclusion : Through the board game, a positive change in memory appeared. It was also confirmed that it has an effect on cognitive function and reduction of depression. However, it is difficult to generalize due to the small number of targets, and the method and components of the board game need to be modified. It is hoped that through further study, board games that complement the problems will continue to be developed and contribute to the improvement of cognitive function and quality of life of the elderly.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

Two radiologists independently determined mrTRG using a 5-point grading system with and without DWI in a one-month interval. Two pathologists graded pTRG using a 5-point grading system in consensus. Kaplan-Meier estimation and Cox-proportional hazard models were used for survival analysis. Cohen’s kappa analysis was used to determine interobserver agreement.Results: According to mrTRG on MRI with DWI, there were 6 mrTRG 1, 48 mrTRG 2, 109 mrTRG 3, 152 mrTRG 4, and 6 mrTRG 5. By pTRG, there were 7 pTRG 1, 59 pTRG 2, 180 pTRG 3, 73 pTRG 4, and 2 pTRG 5. A 5-year overall survival (OS) was significantly different according to the 5-point grading mrTRG (p = 0.024) and pTRG (p = 0.038). The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was significantly different among the five mrTRG groups (p = 0.039), but not among the five pTRG groups (p = 0.072). OS and DFS were significantly different according to post-CRT MR variables: extramural venous invasion after CRT (hazard ratio = 2.259 for OS, hazard ratio = 5.011 for DFS) and extramesorectal lymph node (hazard ratio = 2.610 for DFS). For mrTRG, k value between the two radiologists was 0.309 (fair agreement) without DWI and slightly improved to 0.376 with DWI.Conclusion: mrTRG may predict OS and DFS comparably or even better compared to pTRG. The addition of DWI on T2-weighted MRI may improve interobserver agreement on mrTRG.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

The meaning of literature on shuyosho is summarized in three categories: First, it is a representative text existing among the literatures of completely commentary on the preface of the Chinese monk Taofeng. Second, it is important in the sense that it reflects the critical view of Sen-yu on the existing preface interpretation. Third, while accepting the interpretation tradition of the existing on kyebon-jonygo, Sen-yu had actively represented Tae-hyǒn's position and builded his own ideas. From this point, shuyosho is a very important document in that it can know the trend and development of the annotation about the kyebon-jongyo of Tae-hyǒn. On the other hand, Tae-hyǒn is recognized as the lineage of Wǒnchuk, Xianzhang's most famous disciple. Second, there is a side to deepen Tae-hyǒn's theory while accepting Weonhyo and Fazang's theory. Third, in the difference of each theory such as Ki in China and Uijǒk in Silla, shuyosho is based in Tae-hyǒn's theory.

The experiment was conducted to investigate the relationship of both macro and micro minerals in sheep grazing in the highlands of six districts located in the Qilian Mountain of China. Methods: Samples of herbage (n = 240) and soil (n = 240) were collected at random in a ""W"" shape across the area designated for harvesting from 24 farms, where the sheep commonly graze in October (winter) for mineral analyses. In addition, serum samples were taken via jugular vein from 20 sheep per farm from 24 farms (n = 480 samples in total) for serum minerals analyses. Mean values of macro and micro minerals were statistically compared among districts and the correlations among soil-plant-animal were statistically analyzed and correlations were regressed, as well. Results: The results revealed that there were variations for both macro and micro minerals among districts. Statistical analysis of the correlation coefficients between herbage and sheep were significantly different for most of the minerals but not for P, Cu, and Se. Many correlation regression coefficients were found significantly different among minerals of herbage, soil, and sheep serum especially those of K, Na, Fe, Mn, and Zn (between herbage and sheep serum), and Fe and Mn (between herbage and soil), Na, Fe, Mn, and Zn (between soil and sheep serum), respectively. The regression coefficient equations derived under this experiment for prediction of Ca (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.618), K (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.803), Mg (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.767), Na (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.670), Fe (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.865),Zn (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.950), Mn (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.936), and Se (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.630), resulted in significant R<sup>2</sup> values. Conclusion: It is inferred that the winter herbage minerals in all the districts were below the recommended levels for macro minerals which indicated there would be some mineral deficiencies in sheep grazing the herbage in these regions. Supplemental minerals may therefore play an important role in balancing the minerals available from the herbage in winter and would lead to increased productivity in sheep on the highland areas of China. These findings could be potentially applied to the other regions for improving the livestock productivity.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

This essay is a pedagogical examination of the Five Aspects of Consciousness-Only, which aims to show why Kuiji organized them as he did.The Five Aspects of Consciousness-Only Buddhism consist of objective  conditions (境), interpretation of scripture (敎), principles (理), meditation and practice (行), and the fruit of Buddhahood (果). These five terms are not found in earlier Buddhist scriptures, and thus they can be considered as original terms defined by Kuiji. As for their respective meanings, the  aspect of objective conditions express the logic of Yogâcāra perceiving external objects from a perspective that focuses on what is observed cognitively. The aspect of interpretation lists teachings of Consciousness-Only as shown in various scriptures, while the aspect of principles analyzes the doctrine of Consciousness-Only as shown in scriptures based on the logic of transformation (轉變). Practice deals with the method of contemplating and observing the logic of Consciousness-Only and the practices related  to those teachings. Lastly, the fruit of Buddhahood explains wisdom and  the hierarchy of practice as the result of contemplating and observing the logic of Consciousness-Only.Based on the discussions appearing in each of these five aspects, this  study identifies key doctrines and further examines the background of Kuiji’s categorization of Yogâcāra teachings. The findings suggest that divisions within the structure of the ‘Triṃśikā-kārikā’ or ‘Ch'engwei-shih-jun’ were extended to the Five Aspects of Consciousness-Only by adding sections corresponding with ‘realization through teaching’ (敎證) and ‘realization through principle’ (理證) to cognitive objects (境), practice (行) and fruit (果). Kuiji particularly emphasized the importance of objective conditions. Expanding the discourse in the Dasheng Fayuan Yilin Chang, he further supplemented the aspect of objective conditions into six gates (六門). By doing so, he presumably attempted to reaffirm the core teaching of Consciousness-Only Buddhism, which is  that all phenomena are nothing but consciousness (萬法唯識). This was emphasized with an investigation into the denial of external objects (外境) from various points of view.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

Although article 750 of the Korean Civil Code, which constitutes the general provision for tortious liability in Korean civil law, discriminates neither intent from negligence nor pure economic loss from other losses in terms of the prerequisites as well as effects of tortious liability, the Korean Supreme Court has adopted more or less cautious approach on the compensability of pure economic loss. The same or similar approach has been observed in other countries, even though the ways to achieve this result are different. Some limit compensability of pure economic loss categorically (U.S. and U.K.), while others acknowledge compensability of loss either when it is derived from the infringement of absolute right or from the intentional commission against good moral (Germany, Austria and Switzerland). There is still other country which allow the compensation of pure economic loss in principle (France). The question is whether and how this limitation of compensability of pure economic loss is justified. In this regard, legal doctrine does not help so much. It explains why pure economic loss should not be compensated at any time, while it does not explain why and when pure economic loss should be compensated. On the contrary, economic analysis provides better explanation why and when pure economic loss should be or not be compensated. The basic intuition is as follows: Pure economic loss is a matter of redistribution and not of social cost, which is the reason why negligent inflict of pure economic loss should not be compensated. It might lead to overcaution. Even intentional or conscious infringement of pure economic loss might be allowed because it is a participation of efficient breach. An intentional participation of inefficient breach, however, should be deterred by imposing liability on the third party participants. An unfair competition with illegal means such as fraud or duress also should be deterred by imposing liability on the competitor even when he or she used these means not on the victim directly but on the counterpart of the victim. Last but not least, liability for pure economic loss of the investors who relied on the inaccurate information can be regarded as quasi-contract liability, which is an imputed contract corresponding to the hypothetical mutual intent between the prospective investors and the auditors or any other information providers. This analysis can be integrated to the legal doctrine of tortious liability and provide more detailed criteria to decide whether to compensate pure economic loss.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv
Dynamic Modelling of Low-Temperature Batch In-Bin Drying of Cobed Seed Maize: an Industrial Case Study,2020,['Drying . Energy . Humidity . Modelling . Moisture . Temperature'],,"Purpose In this paper, dynamic models have been developed to predict the air temperature, specific humidity and drying rate in an industrial seed grain dryer.Methods An industrial dryer was utilised for experimental measurements. The dyer was modelled as a system of serial cells characterised by heat and mass transfer with air back-mixing. Model equations were solved numerically based on the Levenberg– Marquardt algorithm in MATLAB. The model response was optimised by signal matching technique. The sensitivity of the model parameters on the prediction accuracy was assessed using Monte Carlo simulation tests. The accuracy of the models was statistically checked using the coefficient of determination (R2), the root mean square error (RMSE), and the probability value (p value) approach.Results The results revealed a good agreement between the measured data and model predictions with the highest mean relative deviation (MRD) of 2.37% and p value of 0.0298 at 5% significance level. The model accuracy was highly sensitive to the parameter that defines the air residence time inside the drying bin. The dryer exhibited air back-mixing level of 45.8% and moisture decay rate constant (k) of 0.028 per hour. The convective heat transfer between the air and seed grain was determined as 0.96 kJ/h m2 °C.Conclusions The dynamic models developed here can adequately predict the outlet air temperature, specific humidity and solids temperature and subsequently the drying curve. The models could help to provide real-time insights of drying characteristics, which is necessary for the achievement of a stable and effective control of the drying process.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv
Comparison of Physical Fitness Factors of High School and College TAEKWONDO Athletes with Anaerobic Exercise and Isokinetic Muscle Function,2020,"['Competition Players', 'Physical Fitness', 'Lsokinetic Muscle Function', 'Anaerobic Capacity', 'Wingate Test']",,"Purpose: Considering the development curve, there may be individual differences, but in the 2nd and 3rd grades of high school, it can be seen that there is no significant difference from that of adults in form. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the differences in body composition and physical strength factors of Taekwondo Gyeorugi players who are attending morphological similar high school and university in form, and provide basic data for physical fitness training of athletes based on the results of this study.Method: The subjects of this study were 13 competition players attending G high school in D city and 13 com-petition players attending K University, and body composition, physical factors, anaerobic exercise ability, and knee joint isokinetic muscle function were tested. For data processing, the mean and standard deviation of the measured items were calculated using the SPSS 25.0 statistical program. An independent t-test was conducted to find out the difference between high school taekwondo players and college students taekwondo players.Results: University Taekwondo competition players were statistically significantly higher in height, lean body weight, and lower extremity than high school competition players, and their body fat percentage was lower. In terms of physical strength, college competition players were superior to high school athletes in terms of strength, endurance, quickness, agility, coordination, and flexibility. The anaerobic exercise ability was significantly higher in college athletes than high school athletes in Peak Power(W), Average Power(W), and Total Energy(J). It was also found that college athletes were superior to high school athletes in knee joint isokinetic muscle function measured at an angular velocity of 60 degrees.Conclusion: The statistically significant difference in the height and lower extremities, which are the physique factors, is judged as the result of not considering weight class in the selection of subjects for this study. The differ-ence in physical strength factors is thought to be a result of the higher athlete experience and training amount of college players than the difference in shape development.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv
Relationship between diet quality and sarcopenia in elderly Koreans: 2008–2011 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,2020,"['Frailty', 'sarcopenia', 'elderly', 'diet', 'public health']",,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Given the increasing proportion of the Korean population that is aged 65 years and older, the present study analyzed the relationship between diet quality and sarcopenia in elderly persons by using data from the 2008–2011 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES).SUBJECTS/METHODS: Data for 3,373 persons aged 65 years and over (men: 1,455, 43.1%) were selected from the 2008–2011 KNHANES. Sarcopenia assessments are based on a formula that divides a subject""s appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) by their weight (wt) and multiplies that result by 100 ([ASM/wt] × 100). Sarcopenia is present if the subject""s result was less than one standard deviation (SD) below the sex-specific mean for a young reference group. For evaluation of diet quality, data obtained via the 24-hour recall method were used to calculate the Diet Quality Index for Koreans (DQI-K). A general linear model was applied in order to analyze general information and nutritional intake according to sarcopenia status. For analysis of the relationship between diet quality and sarcopenia, a binominal logistic regression analysis was undertaken.RESULTS: The sarcopenia prevalence rate among the study subjects aged 65 years and over was 37.6%. The DQI-K of those without sarcopenia was 3.33 ± 0.04 points, while that of those with sarcopenia was 3.45 ± 0.04 points (P < 0.05). The relationship between diet quality and sarcopenia revealed that subjects aged 75 and older had a poor diet quality, and their odds ratio (OR) of sarcopenia presence was significantly higher (OR: 1.807, 95% confidence interval: 1.003–3.254, P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that poor diet quality was related to sarcopenia presence in Koreans aged 75 and older. In order to improve the diet quality of the elderly (aged 75 and older), it is necessary to develop dietary improvement guidelines.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv
Short Term Intake of Undaria pinnatifida Does Not Affect Bone Biomarkers in Young Korean Women with Low Calcium Intake,2020,"['Seaweed', 'Calcium', 'Vitamin D', 'Biomarkers', 'Koreans']",,"Calcium intake is essential for bone health, but young Korean women have low calcium intakes. Seaweeds have high calcium content, which may affect calcium metabolism. Twenty nine females aged 18-39 years with low calcium intake (< 400 mg/day) participated in a 19-day open-label randomized controlled trial. During the first five days, participants adhered to a controlled-feeding protocol followed by a two-week supplementation period in free-living conditions. The treatment group (n = 14) received an additional 200 mg Ca/day through Undaria pinnatifida and Porphyra in meals during the controlled-feeding period, and as U. pinnatifida noodles during days 6-19. Mineral intake (Ca, P, Mg, Na, and K) was assessed from diet composites and three 24-hour recalls during the controlled-feeding and free-living periods, respectively. Fasting serum levels of calcium, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]D), phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were assessed at baseline, day 6, and day 19.

Electrical–Thermal–Mechanical Analysis of Focused Infrared Heating Process,2020,['Focused infrared heating · Local heat treatment · Elliptical reflector · Finite element method · Multi-physics analysis'],,"Demand of infrared (IR) heating technology has been increasing in industrial heat treatment processes to replace traditional heating methods because of this technology’s high energy efficiency. However, numerical analyses of IR heating have not been sufficiently reported. This work proposes a framework for electrical–thermal–mechanical analysis of a focused IR heating process using multi-physics analysis to obtain more information about the physical phenomenon. In the present model, the electrical-thermal analysis simulated the IR lamp converting electrical energy to infrared radiation, then the radiation heating and mechanical analyses of the target material was conducted. The temperature of the IR lamp in the simulation was 2357 °C (around 2600 K), which matches the well-known range of the temperatures (2500–3000 K) of IR lamps. For the radiation heating analysis, four simple models were proposed, based on geometrical-feature, to consider the distribution of IR radiation. With the present model, focused IR heating for a metal sheet was simulated and the results were compared to the experimental data. The normalized root mean square errors (RMSEs) of all of the proposed models were less than 10% for the central temperature, which is the most important heating position of the focused IR heating. The results show that the electrical–thermal–mechanical model provides good agreement with the measured data in predicting local heating eff ect of saving heating energy. In addition, this multi-physics simulation can provide information on the thermal expansion and stress distribution as well as the temperature field of the heated material.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

Methods: We divided 16 Sprague-Dawley rats into young (12 weeks old, n=8) and old (24 months old, n=8) groups and compared muscle and body weight (BW) between them. We also analyzed the expression levels of angiogenic and muscle growth proteins in soleus (slow-twitch) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL; fast-twitch) muscles by western blotting and assessed the number of skeletal muscle satellite cells and myonuclei and mean fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) using by immunofluorescence staining. Results: EDL/BW was significantly lower in old rats than in young rats (p=0.002). The vascular endothelial growth factor level in soleus muscles was significantly lower in old rats than in young rats (p=0.001). Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha and fetal liver kinase 1 levels in EDL muscles were lower in old rats than in young rats (p=0.001). The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), p70S6K, and 4E-BP1 levels were significantly lower in the soleus muscles of old rats than in those of young rats (p<0.01). Similarly, insulin growth factor-1, Akt, mTOR, and p70S6K levels were significantly lower in EDL muscles of old rats than in those of young rats (p<0.01). Additionally, myonuclei/fiber, Pax7/fiber, and mean fiber CSAs in both muscle types were significantly lower in old rats than in young rats (p<0.01).

The structural, optical and electrical transport properties have been explored through various analytical techniques. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns affirm single phase and polycrystalline nature of the samples. Rietveld refinement analysis of the XRD data is used to determine the various structural parameters. It reveals that both the samples belong to orthorhombic crystal system with Pnma space group. Using Scherrer’s equation, a lower value of crystallite size is found in the higher concentration of yttrium doped sample. The band gap as determined from the UV–visible DRS data by employing the Tauc’s relation is found to enhance with the increase of yttrium concentration in La0.7Ca0.3MnO3. The low temperature resistivity measurements establish semiconducting nature of the samples over the temperature range of ~ 110–300 K. Moreover, the electrical resistivity data are interpreted within the variable range hopping (VRH) model to estimate the density of states at the Fermi level N(EF), mean hopping distance Rh(T) and hopping energy Eh(T). It is observed that the electrical quantities vary gradually with the change of Y content. The conduction mechanism in this system is governed in the framework of thermally activated small polaron hopping (SPH) model and accordingly various parameters namely Debye temperature (θD), activation energy (Ep) and optical phonon frequency (νph) are evaluated. The obtained results support a strong connection between structure and electrical behavior in our samples and can be elucidated on the basis of localization of charge carriers induced by the substituting ions.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

For an empirical analysis, total 349 questionnaires were collected from the flight attendants in “K” airline in Korea. First, the 8 dimensions of professionalism in flight attendants based on the Yoo and Lee(2020), which are passion, open-mindedness, team-oriented attitude, job-related skills and knowledge, emotional self-control, professional ethics, role example, and perfectionism is also verified in this research. Second, two hypotheses that flight attendant’s self-directed learning and family support will have a positive effect on professionalism was verified by regression analysis. Especially, self-directed learning is more important variable which fosters the professionalism than family support. Third, a hypothesis 3 that professionalism in flight attendants is associated with career satisfaction was accepted through regression analysis.

First, Dharmacakrapravartanasūtra provides clues to understand the ‘four noble truths and the destruction of fluxes,’ the standard form of Āgamas and the Nikāyas. That is, the discovery of and insights into the ‘four noble truths’ made five monks understand the intrinsic nature of things. Since the ‘five skandhas’ are impermanence and unsatisfactoriness, which are the three characteristics of existence, recognizing the groups as samyakdṛṣṭi that they are ‘self’ or ‘non-self’ leads to the destruction of fluxes and the complete nirvāṇa of arhat. Here, the keywords ‘four noble truths’ and the demonstration of the ‘anātman of five skandhas’ play critical roles in Sarvāstivādins' practice, such as abhisamaya. “Saṅgītiparyāya,’ the earliest text of Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma, explains that the ‘four noble truths’ are satya, and the recognition that ‘saṃskārā is anitya, sāsravā saṃskārā is duḥkha, and sarve dharmā is śūnya and anātman’ leads to the acquisition of laukikāgra-dharma and anāsrava, which corresponds with dharmajñānakṣānti. Such characteristics of sarve dharmā are suggested by the four ākāras of duḥkhasatya among the sixteen ākāras of the noble truths in later Saṅgītiparyāya. Moreover, fragmentary concepts were presented in more details than in “Dharmaskandha.” Meanwhile, Dharmaskandha’ presents four noble truths enlightened by Buddha as a model of practice, and it also briefly explains darśanaheyakleśaparihāṇa and bhāvanāheyakleśaprahāṇa which are eliminated by recognizing the ‘four noble truths.’Unlike “Saṅgītiparyāya” and “Dharmaskandha” that explain abhisamaya from the practical aspect of law, “Prakaraṇapāda” adopts ‘five categories’ rather than the ‘five skandhas’ to describe the concept and correlation of sarve dharmā in detail. Abhisamaya is the function of prajñā with a nature of dharmapravicaya, which is classified as one of caitasika that corresponds with mind. Prajñā is interpreted as dharmapravicaya or vipaśyanā here, suggesting that dharmapravicaya, a unique interpretation of Sarvāstivādin unlike the path of Āgamas and Nikāyas, would soon combine with the theory of practice. Such characteristics become more apparent in the stage of Mahāvibhāṣa, meaning that the “Analysis by the formation of character of sarve dharmā and the theory of practice which leads to the extinguishment of sufferings.”",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

But there is a limit to how far Korea can be called an “open society” for the refugees. The system exists, but only with a limited scope of acceptance. Also, there is an absence of social consensus on how to approach the refugees, psychologically, culturally or policy-wise. For this reason, the main discussion of the refugees so far has only proceeded under the concept of human rights and national sovereignty. However, South Korea, as a nation aspiring to be inclusive, is at a point in time where it needs to think about how to accommodate the strangers within its territory, as the refugees’ request to enter the country continues. Therefore, this article aims to seek the direction of social engagement of the refugees. In particular, it suggests a cultural approach to narrow down the social distance between the citizens and refugees and form new relationships. To this end, we look at the meaning of social exclusion and inclusion, present the framework of conviviality, and discuss it through the cases of the U.K. and several other European countries with prior experiences. Using the framework of conviviality, we analyze the refugee-related arts and cultural activities at Coun-terpoint Arts in the U.K. and find that such activities work as a good medium to share the values of diversity and equality. Moreover, they facilitate reciprocal understanding between people. Thus, the arts and cultural approach may be a practical alternative to achieve a convivial society as it can contribute to expansion of one’s mind and enhance social cohesion.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

Traditional sensitivity-based updating methods cannot support updating based on static and dynamic measurement data at the same time. The finite element model is required in every optimization iteration which limits the efficiency greatly. A convenient but accurate Kriging surrogate model for updating of the finite element model of cable-stayed bridge is proposed. First, a simple cable-stayed bridge is used to verify the method and the updating results of Kriging model are compared with those using the response surface model. Results show that Kriging model has higher accuracy than the response surface model. Then the method is utilized to update the model of a long-span cable-stayed bridge in Hong Kong. The natural frequencies are extracted using various methods from the ambient data collected by the Wind and Structural Health Monitoring System installed on the bridge. The maximum deflection records at two specific locations in the load test form the updating objective function. Finally, the fatigue lives of the structure at two cross sections are calculated with the finite element models before and after updating considering the mean stress effect. Results are compared with those calculated from the strain gauge data for verification.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

First, North Korean immigrant men signified their re-migration as a plan to overcome life crises experienced as men/heads of family in South Korean society and to change their family status. Second, they judged that by moving to British society, they were able to function reliably as breadwinners and thus play a minimal role as ‘head of household.’ Third, this self-assessment and New Malden’s special locational characteristics have led them to various ‘social activities.’ Combining the cultural elements of North Korea and the hegemonic masculinity of the U.K., these ‘social activities’ can be regarded as both the achievement of their transnational migration and attempts to construct their identity as valuable and respected men.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

King Wongseong, who practically reformed the late Silla era (下代), tried to strengthen his kingdom by serving his prince because he was abnormally crowned. However, unlike his willing, Silla society in the late 8th c entury to early 9th c entury was politic ally very c onfused.Apart from the political situation, there was a peculiar phenomenon in Buddhism at this period. Monuments were built to establish temples or memorials of the ancient monarchs around King Wonseong. Before the crowning of King Wonseong, the father and mother of King Wonseong built Mujang Temple(鍪藏寺) and Galhang Temple(葛項寺), and their descendants continued to do Buddhist activities even after they came to the throne. King Ejang, who banned Shinchangbulsa(新創佛寺), also founded Haein Temple in his third year of reign(802). A year earlier, Gyeonghwa(桂花夫人), the mother of King Ejang, also built Amitabha in the Mujang Temple(鍪藏寺) worship her husband.The ancestors of King Wonseong were the forces that were pushed out of the mainstream throughout the middle period of Silla(中代). The middle period of Silla(中代) was a period in which power was secured around the direct descendants of King Muyeol, and the forces that were pushed out of the mainstream were born.Kim Kyungshin(King Wongseong) set up a transitional period for his ascension by placing King Yangsang(King Seondeok), who is close to the royal family at that time, in the confused gap of the King Hyegong. King Seondeok dies without aftermath and defeated Kim Joowon, eventually himself became the king. Therefore, King Wongseong had to present the vision of a new Silla society different from the previous era.It was Buddhism that King Wongseong presented as a vision of a new society. King Wongseong had to claim that the late period of Silla(下代) was different from the middle period of Silla(中代) and in that way, he pursuit the Middle-Ancient period of Silla(中古期). It is a remembranc e phenomenon of Lee Chadon, Ado, Wonhyo and Shinheng. So, the prohibition of Shinchangbulsa(新創佛寺) in the 7th year of King Ejang (806) can also be understood in the same context as the policy of King Wonseong. The time of prohibition of Shinchangbulsa(新創佛寺) and the time when remembrance was made about Lee Chadon(異次頓), Ado(阿道), Wonhyo(元曉) and Shinheng(神行) were same period.In addition, the ban on the usage of luxury goods, along with the prohibition of the Shinchangbulsa(新創佛寺), was intended to control the ec onomic base of the Jingol aristoc rats. This was due to the lac k of justification for the right of kings who had suffered in common with kings of the late period of Silla(下代) including King Wonseong. Because they were all threatened by kingship for different reasons, there were forces that threatened their throne. By regulating them, we can see that the intention was to increase the king's authority by distinguishing the king from the Jingol(眞骨) aristocrats.",k-means_2020_academic_riss.csv

Novel oversampling methods based on the generative adversarial networks (GAN) have been recently developed, but generated samples may have different degrees of impact on the performance of the classifier. Therefore, more efficient method that can capture the characteristics of the generated samples and select those samples that will be used to train and improve the performance of the classifier is necessary. This study proposes a GAN-based new oversampling method which generates artificial samples based on the distribution of existing minority class samples and extracts only those which are effective to expand the realm of samples of minority class using the k-nearest neighbor.

When companies analyze their products or compare them with competitors, appropriate criteria must be selected for objective evaluation. The criteria should show the features of products that consumers considered when they purchased, used and evaluated the products. However, current evaluation criteria do not reflect different consumers’ opinion from product to product. Previous studies tried to used online reviews from e-commerce sites that reflect consumer opinions to extract the features and topics of products and use them as evaluation criteria. However, there is still a limit that they produce irrelevant criteria to products due to extracted or improper words are not refined. To overcome this limitation, this research suggests LDA-k-NN model which extracts possible criteria words from online reviews by using LDA and refines them with k-nearest neighbor.  Proposed approach starts with preparation phase, which is constructed with 6 steps. At first, it collects review data from e-commerce websites. Most e-commerce websites classify their selling items by high-level, middle-level, and low-level categories. Review data for preparation phase are gathered from each middle-level category and collapsed later, which is to present single high-level category. Next, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and verbs are extracted from reviews by getting part of speech information using morpheme analysis module. After preprocessing, words per each topic from review are shown with LDA and only nouns in topic words are chosen as potential words for criteria. Then, words are tagged based on possibility of criteria for each middle-level category. Next, every tagged word is vectorized by pre-trained word embedding model. Finally, k-nearest neighbor case-based approach is used to classify each word with tags.  After setting up preparation phase, criteria extraction phase is conducted with low-level categories. This phase starts with crawling reviews in the corresponding low-level category. Same preprocessing as preparation phase is conducted using morpheme analysis module and LDA. Possible criteria words are extracted by getting nouns from the data and vectorized by pre-trained word embedding model. Finally, evaluation criteria are extracted by refining possible criteria words using k-nearest neighbor approach and reference proportion of each word in the words set.  To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, an experiment was conducted with review on ‘11st’, one of the biggest e-commerce companies in Korea. Review data were from ‘Electronics/Digital’ section, one of high-level categories in 11st. For performance evaluation of suggested model, three other models were used for comparing with the suggested model; actual criteria of 11st, a model that extracts nouns by morpheme analysis module and refines them according to word frequency, and a model that extracts nouns from LDA topics and refines them by word frequency. The performance evaluation was set to predict evaluation criteria of 10 low-level categories with the suggested model and 3 models above. Criteria words extracted from each model were combined into a single words set and it was used for survey questionnaires. In the survey, respondents chose every item they consider as appropriate criteria for each category. Each model got its score when chosen words were extracted from that model. The suggested model had higher scores than other models in 8 out of 10 low-level categories. By conducting paired t-tests on scores of each model, we confirmed that the suggested model shows better performance in 26 tests out of 30. In addition, the suggested model was the best model in terms of accuracy.

Road networks are highly dynamic; traffic situation changes constantly owing to vehicle movements and unpredicted constructions and accidents. Thus, it is crucial for road network applications to periodically reorganize the index to fully reflect the changes. In such a circumstance, rather than modifying the existing index for each of the changes, it is more efficient to quickly bulk load a new index for the entire road network. The previous M-tree bulk loading algorithms heavily conduct ‘expensive’ shortest-path distance computations and disk page accesses, thereby degrading their performances. The algorithm proposed in this study reduces the number of shortest-path distance computations using landmark multidimensional scaling (LMDS). In addition, since our algorithm stores M-tree nodes in disk and does not access them again, the number of disk page accesses is also dramatically reduced. Experimental results demonstrated that our algorithm outperformed the previous algorithm by up to 21.3 times (single-thread version) and 106 times (multi-thread version with 64 concurrent threads) for M-tree construction and that the performance of the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) search using the M-tree built by our algorithm was also improved by up to 1.22 times.",k-NN_2020_academic_riss.csv

The sensor was designed based on the principles of parallel capacitance measurement using conductive textile and the monitoring system was developed by C# language. Three separate experiments were carried out for performance evaluation of the proposed sensor: (1) varying the distance between two capacitance plates to examine changes in capacitance charges, (2) repeatedly applying 1 N of pressure for 5,000 times to evaluate consistency, and (3) gradually increasing force by 1 N (from 1 N to 46 N) to test the linearity of the sensor value.

Genotyping was performed using 16 selected polymorphic microsatellite markers distributed across 10 chromosomes.Results: The average observed and expected heterozygosity, mean number of alleles and polymorphic information content were found to be 0.67±0.01, 0.70±0.01, 10.7 and 0.748, respectively in the studied populations. The estimated overall fixation index across the loci (F), heterozygote deficiency within (FIS) and among (FIT) chicken populations were 0.04±0.02, 0.05 and 0.16, respectively. Analysis of molecular variance analysis revealed 88.07% of the total genetic diversity was accounted for within population variation and the rest 11.93% was incurred with population differentiation (FST). The highest pairwise genetic distance (0.154) was found between ND and AS while the lowest distance was between JF and AS (0.084). Structure analysis depicted that the studied samples can be categorized into four distinct types or varieties (ΔK = 3.74) such as ND, NN, and HI where AS and JF clustered together as an admixed population.

A study on defect detection in X-ray image castings based on unsupervised learning,2020,"['Defect detection', 'X-ray image', 'Castings', 'Unsupervised', 'Deep learning']",,"In this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based defect detection system for the non-destructive quality inspection of castings based on X-ray images. Our system comprises a defect classification network and a defect search network and achieves high classifi-cation performance with limited data by minimizing the overfitting for one type of object. The proposed defect classification network determines whether the acquired X-ray image is Defect by using a convolution neural network and outputs the defect probability through softmax. Compared to binarized defect classification or defect location tracking, this method of outputting the defect proba-bility does not require a separate reworking of the training dataset, because the data labeling is the same as the existing quality evalu-ation task. In addition, to detect the location of the defect causing the defect classification, our proposed defect search network estimates the region where the defect is likely to exist through a Grad-CAM based on the feature map of the classification network. The proposed network then determines the ROI around each peak of the estimated regions and detects the exact shape and location of the defect through boundary detection. It is, therefore, possible to minimize quality control costs through a precise quality analysis of each casting product by simultaneously detecting small defects that are easy to ignore because large defects are found in the image. To verify the validity of this study, an experiment was conducted by constructing a dataset of actual cast products, and the proposed detection model achieved an accuracy of 90%. In addition, by comparing the fully connected network and the SVM-based model, the model improved by about 20%, demonstrating that it is possible to detect defects without labeling defect locations.",unsupervised_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Thus, an unsupervised one-class classifier can be effectively used in anomaly detection. In this paper, to resolve this problem, we propose a model that can detect abnormal data by learning latent space along the distribution of normal data through one-class adversarial learning. It comprises three modules: an encoder, a decoder, and a classifier. The encoder and decoder have an autoencoder structure that compresses the input data to be transferred to the latent space and restores them to the original. The classifier is trained to determine if the standard or distorted normal data are transferred by inputting the transferred data. The encoder learns the distribution of the normal data more precisely by training it with the classifier in adversarial learning so that the distorted normal data is also classified as the standard normal data by the classifier.Our proposed model shows the detection performance of area under the ROC curve 0.91 and 0.72 using the MNIST and the UCSD Ped2 datasets, well-known benchmark datasets in anomaly detection.",unsupervised_learning_2020_academic_riss.csv

Therefore, a method with objective and accurate image analysis processing is required. In recent years, the methods using deep learning have been studied to detect cracks quickly and accurately.

The recent image translation technology enables changes between various domains. However, current image-to-image translation techniques do not provide stable performance through unsupervised learning, especially for shape learning in the face transition field. This is because the face is a highly sensitive feature, and the quality of the resulting image is significantly affected, especially if the transitions in the eyes, nose, and mouth are not effectively performed. We herein propose a new unsupervised method that can transform an in-wild face image into another face style through radical transformation.
