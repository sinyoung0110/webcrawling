The 8 years NIER indices with the water quality (T-N, NH4, NO3, T-P, PO4) showed that the deviation of AHI score is large when the concentration of water quality is low, and AHI score had negative correlation when the concentration is high. By using random forest, one of the Machine Learning techniques for classification analysis, the classification results for the 3 indices grade showed that all of precision, recall, and f1-score were above 0.81. The future SWAT hydrology and water quality results under HadGEM3-RA RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios of Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) showed that the future nitrogen-related water quality in watershed average increased up to 43.2% by the baseflow increase effect and the phosphorus-related water quality decreased up to 18.9% by the surface runoff decrease effect. The future FAI and BMI showed a little better Index grade while the future TDI showed a little worse index grade. We can infer that the future TDI is more sensitive to nitrogen-related water quality and the future FAI and BMI are responded to phosphorus-related water quality."
A Clustering Approach for Feature Selection in Microarray Data Classification Using Random Forest,2018,"['Classification', 'Clustering', 'Dimensional Reduction', 'Microarray', 'Random Forest']",,"Microarray data plays an essential role in diagnosing and detecting cancer. Microarray analysis allows the examination of levels of gene expression in specific cell samples, where thousands of genes can be analyzed simultaneously. However, microarray data have very little sample data and high data dimensionality. Therefore, to classify microarray data, a dimensional reduction process is required. Dimensional reduction can eliminate redundancy of data; thus, features used in classification are features that only have a high correlation with their class. There are two types of dimensional reduction, namely feature selection and feature extraction. In this paper, we used k-means algorithm as the clustering approach for feature selection. The proposed approach can be used to categorize features that have the same characteristics in one cluster, so that redundancy in microarray data is removed. The result of clustering is ranked using the Relief algorithm such that the best scoring element for each cluster is obtained. All best elements of each cluster are selected and used as features in the classification process. Next, the Random Forest algorithm is used. Based on the simulation, the accuracy of the proposed approach for each dataset, namely Colon, Lung Cancer, and Prostate Tumor, achieved 85.87%, 98.9%, and 89% accuracy, respectively. The accuracy of the proposed approach is therefore higher than the approach using Random Forest without clustering."

Prediction of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation using Time-domain Analysis and Random Forest,2018,"['atrial fibrillation prediction', 'random forest', 'Lorenz plot', 'Poincare plot']",,"The present study proposes an algorithm that can discriminate between normal subjects and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) patients, which is conducted using electrocardiogram (ECG) without PAF events. For this, time-domain features and random forest classifier are used. Time-domain features are obtained from Poincare plot, Lorenz plot of ${\delta}RR$ interval, and morphology analysis. Afterward, three features are selected in total through feature selection. PAF patients and normal subjects are classified using random forest. The classification result showed that sensitivity and specificity were 81.82% and 95.24% respectively, the positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 96.43% and 76.92% respectively, and accuracy was 87.04%. The proposed algorithm had an advantage in terms of the computation requirement compared to existing algorithm, so it has suggested applicability in the more efficient prediction of PAF."

Random forest classifier for real-time chemical leak source tracking using fence-monitoring sensors,2018,"['Chemical Leak Accident', 'Source Tracking', 'Inverse Problem', 'Random Forest', 'Artificial Intelligence']",,"Fast and reliable diagnosis of chemical leak and leak location(s) can save lives and reduce the damage from chemical accidents by enabling quick response. This paper presents a method that uses random forest (RF) classifier to track the location of chemical leak in real-time. A set of big data of leak accidents, which is needed to learn the RF classifier, is extracted by performing massive CFD simulations on a real chemical plant. The RF model is designed with optimal parameters and descriptors through parameter effect experiment. Feature ranking is also implemented to eliminate unnecessary attributes from the dataset. Using the pre-processed data, the optimal RF model achieved a test accuracy of 86.9% for the classification problem of predicting the leak location among 40-potential leak sources in the plant.Furthermore, when analyzing prediction errors by visualizing the classification boundary of RF model, most of the prediction errors are confirmed to be misclassification of adjacent leak locations. Considering the high prediction accuracy of the RF model, the RF-based leak source tracking model is expected to be effectively applied to industrial leak accidents."
Predicting Corporate Bankruptcy using Simulated Annealing-based Random Forests,2018,"['Simulated Annealing', 'Random Forests', 'Bankruptcy Prediction', 'Feature Selection', 'Business Analytics', '시뮬레이티드 어니일링', '랜덤 포레스트', '부도예측', '특징선택', '비즈니스 애널리틱스']",,"Predicting a company's financial bankruptcy is traditionally one of the most crucial forecasting problems in business analytics. In previous studies, prediction models have been proposed by applying or combining statistical and machine learning-based techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel intelligent prediction model based on the simulated annealing which is one of the well-known optimization techniques. The simulated annealing is known to have comparable optimization performance to the genetic algorithms. Nevertheless, since there has been little research on the prediction and classification of business decision-making problems using the simulated annealing, it is meaningful to confirm the usefulness of the proposed model in business analytics. In this study, we use the combined model of simulated annealing and machine learning to select the input features of the bankruptcy prediction model. Typical types of combining optimization and machine learning techniques are feature selection, feature weighting, and instance selection. This study proposes a combining model for feature selection, which has been studied the most. In order to confirm the superiority of the proposed model in this study, we apply the real-world financial data of the Korean companies and analyze the results. The results show that the predictive accuracy of the proposed model is better than that of the naïve model. Notably, the performance is significantly improved as compared with the traditional decision tree, random forests, artificial neural network, SVM, and logistic regression analysis."
An Assessment of a Random Forest Classifier for a Crop Classification Using Airborne Hyperspectral Imagery,2018,"['Crop type classification', 'Hyperspectral imagery', 'Random Forest', 'Parameter optimization', 'Out-Of-Bag error', 'Variable importance']",,"Crop type classification is essential for supporting agricultural decisions and resource monitoring. Remote sensing techniques, especially using hyperspectral imagery, have been effective in agricultural applications. Hyperspectral imagery acquires contiguous and narrow spectral bands in a wide range. However, large dimensionality results in unreliable estimates of classifiers and high computational burdens. Therefore, reducing the dimensionality of hyperspectral imagery is necessary. In this study, the Random Forest (RF) classifier was utilized for dimensionality reduction as well as classification purpose. RF is an ensemble-learning algorithm created based on the Classification and Regression Tree (CART), which has gained attention due to its high classification accuracy and fast processing speed. The RF performance for crop classification with airborne hyperspectral imagery was assessed. The study area was the cultivated area in Chogye-myeon, Habcheon-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do, South Korea, where the main crops are garlic, onion, and wheat. Parameter optimization was conducted to maximize the classification accuracy. Then, the dimensionality reduction was conducted based on RF variable importance. The result shows that using the selected bands presents an excellent classification accuracy without using whole datasets. Moreover, a majority of selected bands are concentrated on visible (VIS) region, especially region related to chlorophyll content. Therefore, it can be inferred that the phenological status after the mature stage influences red-edge spectral reflectance."

Noncontact Sleep Study Based on an Ensemble of Deep Neural Network and Random Forests,2018,,,"<P>Sleep quality, which is an undervalued health issue that affects well-being and daily lives, is checked through the polysomnography (PSG), considered as the gold standard for determining sleep stages. Due to the obtrusiveness of its sensor attachments, recent sleep stage classification algorithms using noninvasive sensors have been developed and commercialized. However, the newly developed devices and algorithms used in the previous studies have lacked the detection of non-rapid eye movement and rapid eye movement sleep, which are known to be correlated with the development of sleep disorders, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, and neurodegeneration. We devise a novel approach to employ ensemble of deep neural network and random forest for the performance of noncontact sleep stage classification. Notably, this paper is designed based on the PSG data of sleep-disordered patients, which were received and certified by professionals at Hanyang University Hospital. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is highlighted by contrasting sleep stage classification performance with previously proposed methods and a commercialized sleep monitoring device called ResMed S+. The proposed algorithm was assessed with random patients following gold-standard measurement schemes (PSG examination), and results show a promising novel approach for determining sleep stages in an economical and unobtrusive manner.</P>"

Overall, 17 tree species found in natural forest comprising 8 families while in the teak stand 6 species were recorded. In understory strata 23 species were recorded (18 herbs and 5 shrubs) in natural forest whereas in teak stand 20 herb species and 3 shrubs were found. Great variation was also seen in the population dynamics of the different vegetation stratum in concerned sites. The sapling, seedling and herb density was found to be highest in natural stand while tree and shrub density was more in teak stand. Results indicated that stand biomass of the natural site was 321.19 t ha-1 while in the teak stand it was 276.61 t ha-1. The total biomass of tree layer in plantation site was 245.22 t ha-1 and natural forest 241.44 t ha-1. The sapling, seedling, shrub and forest floor biomass was found highest under natural forest as compared to the teak plantation site. Carbon stock has similar trend as that of biomass accumulation in natural forest and teak stand. Higher biomass accumulation and carbon stock were recorded in the higher girth class gradation of the population structure.

Only tree with dbh ${\geq}10cm$ and dbh above 1.5 m above ground level were recorded as individual species. A total of 29 tree species belonging to 18 families were recorded from the three zones of the river. Tree species richness was highest at the middle zone (19) followed by upper (14) and lower zone (7). The most abundant species and family recorded at upper, middle and lower zones were Melia azaderach of Euphorbiaceae ($380\;stems\;ha^{-1}$), Terminalia chebula of Euphorbiaceae ($432.5\;stems\;ha^{-1}$) and Duabanga grandiflora of Lythraceae ($365\;stems\;ha^{-1}$) respectively. The ranges of diversity indices observed in the three zones were: Shannon-Wiener index (1.25-0.73), Simpson diversity index (0.42-0.93), Evenness index (0.47-0.37) and Index of co-dominance (0.75-0.94). Rest of other indices were also estimated and compared. Distribution of trees shows the contagious pattern common in the upper and middle zones and regular in the lower zone. The girth size class analysis demonstrated that the riparian forest is in less mature succession stage.

Least square method was used to convert the counted stumps into harvested stem cross-sectional areas. Six basal area models were fitted and evaluated. The BA-Ds relationship was best described by power model which gave least values of Root mean square error (0.0048), prediction error sum of squares (0.0325) and Akaike information criterion (-15391) with a high adjusted coefficient of determination (0.921).

Considering hetroscadasticity of variance, all functions were fitted using weighted nonlinear least square regression. To evaluate the performance of each model, five fit statistics-such as Coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), bias (E), absolute mean deviation (AMD), and coefficient of variation (CV%) were used. Among all the models tested, the Weibull type function of the form H¼1.3þa (1-exp (-bDc))þE was observed to give the best fit based on the model’s goodness of fit and predictive ability.Therefore, this model with three parameters has been conformed to provide reliable estimate of total tree height for Cupressus lusitanica in Gergeda forest, Ethiopia."

Geospatial technology based diversity and above ground biomass assessment of woody species of West Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh,2018,"['Species diversity', 'community composition', 'geospatial technique', 'satellite data', 'tree biomass']",,"Comprehending the prominence of forest carbon in climate change, this study was piloted in different land use of West Kameng district, Arunachal Pradesh, India to record the floristic composition, community characteristics, and above ground biomass (AGB) carbon using random sampling and geospatial approach. Preliminary field survey was done in 2016. Altogether 45 quadrats (0.1 ha each) were laid. Total tree richness recorded was 164 species from 49 families. Dominance and frequency distribution pattern of species revealed heterogeneity in composition with majority species showing clumped distribution. Plantations showed highest tree density while mixed dense forest showed maximum basal area (58.89 m2 ha¡1). Estimated AGB were 218.21 ton/ha for mixed dense forest, 84.94 ton/ha for abandoned forest, and 105.09 ton/ha for plantations. Total estimated carbon stocks were 120.01, 46.17, and 57.80 ton/ha for mixed dense, abandoned forest, and plantations, respectively. Predicted average AGB using Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques was 163.25 ton/ha. Field-based AGB was slightly greater than the values observed from satellite data.Findings of the study may be useful for calculating total biomass and carbon stored in the major land cover of the district in particular and region in general. It will also support in future studies for calculating the long-term data on biomass carbon sequestration."

A total of three soil samples were collected around the C. sinensis trees where the fruits were collected into well labeled polythene bags and thereafter taken to laboratory for analysis. Pb concentrations in C. sinensis and soil samples were analysed using atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS). The concentration of Pb in the air was measured for 14 days using Aeroquel 500. The significant relationship between Pb concentration in the C. sinensis fruits, soil and air was determined using Spearman's rank correlation. Findings showed that the mean weight and width of C. sinensis fruits were highest in the residential landuse while the mean length of C. sinensis fruits was highest in the industrial landuse. However, the mean Pb concentration in the C. sinensis fruit was highest in the industrial landuse ($0.46{\pm}0.15mg\;kg^{-1}$), commercial landuse ($0.33{\pm}0.09mg\;kg^{-1}$) and the least was found in the natural forest ($0.25{\pm}0.06mg\;kg^{-1}$). The mean Pb concentration in the soil was highest in the industrial landuse ($0.177{\pm}0.16mg\;kg^{-1}$) and commercial landuse ($0.121{\pm}0.10mg\;kg^{-1}$).

Assessment of different pretreatments to breakage dormancy and improve the seed germination in Elaeocarpus serratus L. - an underutilized multipurpose fruit tree from South India,2018,"['Elaeocarpaceae', 'germination capacity', 'mechanical scarification', 'pre-treatment', 'seed viability', 'water uptake']",,"The seeds of Elaeocarpus serratus, a tropical underutilized fruit tree are characterized by hard seed coat and consequent poor water uptake and low germination. To improve the regeneration through seeds, various parameters such as viability of seeds, water uptake, and effect of seed mass on germination and pretreatments were performed using a completely randomized design (CRD). Tetrazolium (TZ) test was conducted using fresh, mature seeds revealed 50±2.56% mean viability. Seeds of different weight classes showed similar pattern of water uptake and the saturation level was achieved at 60hrs of soaking. Seeds belong to weight class 2.6-3.5g were germinated (12.5±1.26%) with 175±1.75 days (d) of mean time taken for germination (MTG). Germination capacity of seeds varied significantly among different populations and Varkala population gave 12.5±1.1% germination with 174.6±2.5 d MTG. Among various seed treatments, mechanical scarification was superior in germination and significant reduction in MTG (p0.05). The mechanical scarification by complete removal of seed coat resulted in 49.2±1.52% germination within a short period of time (9.52±0.89 d MTG). However, the complete removal of seed coat without damaging to embryo is a difficult task. An alternate treatment (Mechanical scarification II) by making cracks on nut faces vertically followed by soaking in distilled water for 24hrs gave 48.4±1.73% germination with significantly reduced MTG (12.14±0.56 d) over unsoaked, untreated control (6.5±1.84% germination and 197.18±1.79 d MTG; p0.05). This treatment (Mechanical scarification II) is therefore recommended for E. serratus seeds as it can adopt easily and can achieve 7 fold increases in germination over control. The recorded germination through mechanical scarification is in tune with realized viability percentage of the seeds."

After separate incubation of bacteria and fungi on 3M Petrifilm plates, we counted the number of bacterial and fungal colonies appeared on the plates and compared the numbers among the temperature and density treatment groups. For temperature treatment, high-temperature group had fewer bacterial colonies, while low-temperature group had more fungal colonies than the other two groups. For density treatment, low-density group had fewer bacterial colonies than the other two groups, but the number of fungal colonies were not different among the groups. Our results suggest that small increased rearing water temperature and lowered rearing density could potentially reduce pathogens in farming frogs."

유도탄의 실시간 표적 재지정을 위한 랜덤 포레스트 기법과 시뮬레이션 기반 효과 분석,2018,,,"The study of air defense against North Korean tactical ballistic missiles (TBM) should consider the rapidly changing battlefield environment. The study for target re-designation for intercept missiles enables effective operation of friendly defensive assets as well as responses to dynamic battlefield. The researches that have been conducted so far do not represent real-time dynamic battlefield situation because the hit probability for the TBM, which plays an important role in the decision making process, is fixed. Therefore, this study proposes a target re-designation algorithm that makes decision based on hit probability which considers real-time field environment. The proposed method contains a trajectory prediction model that predicts the expected trajectory of the TBM from the current position and velocity information by using random forest and moving window. The predicted hit probability can be calculated through the trajectory prediction model and the simulator of the intercept missile, and the calculated hit probability becomes the decision criterion of the target re-designation algorithm for the missile. In the experiment, the validity of the methodology used in the TBM trajectory prediction model was verified and the superiority of using the hit probability through the proposed model in the target re-designation decision making process was validated."

Thus, meteorological factors as well as topographical and forest factors were considered in the fire danger rating systems. This study aims to develop an advanced national integrated daily weather index(DWI) using weather data in the spring and fall to support forest fire prevention strategy in South Korea. DWI represents the meteorological characteristics, such as humidity (relative and effective), temperature and wind speed, and we integrated nine logistic regression models of the past into one national model. One national integrated model of the spring and fall is respectively [1+exp{-(2.706+(0.088*Tmean)-(0.055*Rh)-(0.023*Eh)-(0.014*Wmean))}-1]-1, [1+exp{-(1.099+(0.117*Tmean)-(0.069*Rh)-(0.182*Wmean))}-1]-1 and all weather variables significantly (p<0.01) affected the probability of forest fire occurrence in the overall regions.

This paper described the development of a forest disaster detection method by combining the existing spectral methods and a state-of-the-art deep learning technique. NBR(Normalized Burned Ratio), BAI(Burn Area Index), and FBI(Fire Burn Index), which are mainly used fire damage indices, were applied to seven forest fires cases together with the satellite images from Kompsat-3A, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 5. The existing spectral methods have limitation of threshold adjustment for each region and for each season. To mitigate this problem, we used the FCN(Fully Convolutional Network)-based U-Net model, which produced more effective detectability of forest fire damages. For future work, the result of spectral methods and several deep learning techniques can be compared quantitatively to prove the performance of U-Net model objectively."

Time-series analysis on high resolution images requires to collect extensive amount of ground truth data. In this study, the potential of land coverage mapas ground truth data was tested in classifying high-resolution imagery. The study site was Wonju-si at Gangwon-do, South Korea, having a mix of urban and natural areas. KOMPSAT-3A imagery taken on March 2015 and land coverage map published in 2017 were used as source data. Two pixel-based classification algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), were selected for the analysis. Forest only classification was compared with that of the whole study area except wetland. Confusion matrixes from the classification presented that overall accuracies for both the targets were higher in RF algorithm than in SVM. While the overall accuracy in the forest only analysis by RF algorithm was higher by 18.3% than SVM, in the case of the whole region analysis, the difference was relatively smaller by 5.5%. For the SVM algorithm, adding the Majority analysis process indicated a marginal improvement of about 1% than the normal SVM analysis. It was found that the RF algorithm was more effective to identify the broad-leaved forest within the forest, but for the other classes the SVM algorithm was more effective. As the two pixel-based classification algorithms were tested here, it is expected that future classification will improve the overall accuracy and the reliability by introducing a time-series analysis and an object-based algorithm. It is considered that this approach will contribute to improving a large-scale land planning by providing an effective land classification method on higher spatial and temporal scales."

Financial characteristics help build prediction models that are expected to be contained in the assigning model of the bond rating agencies. However, the ranges of bond ratings in existing studies vary from 5 to 20 and the prediction models were developed with samples in which the target companies and the observation periods are different. Thus, a simple comparison of the prediction accuracies in each study cannot determine the best prediction model. In order to conduct a fair comparison, this study has collected corporate bond ratings and financial characteristics from 2013 to 2017 and applied prediction models to them. In addition, we applied the elastic-net penalty for the linear regression, the ordered logit, and the ordered probit. Our comparison shows that data-driven variable selection using the elastic-net improves prediction accuracy in each corresponding model, and that the random forest is the most appropriate model in terms of prediction accuracy, which obtains 69.6% accuracy of the exact rating prediction on average from the 5-fold cross validation."

However, starting from 2015 the Korean film industry entered a period of low growth and experienced a negative growth after all in 2016. To overcome such difficulty, stakeholders like production company, distribution company, multiplex have attempted to maximize the market returns using strategies of predicting change of market and of responding to such market change immediately. Since a film is classified as one of experiential products, it is not easy to predict a box office record and the initial number of audiences before the film is released. And also, the number of audiences fluctuates with a variety of factors after the film is released. So, the production company and distribution company try to be guaranteed the number of screens at the opining time of a newly released by multiplex chains. However, the multiplex chains tend to open the screening schedule during only a week and then determine the number of screening of the forthcoming week based on the box office record and the evaluation of audiences. Many previous researches have conducted to deal with the prediction of box office records of films. In the early stage, the researches attempted to identify factors affecting the box office record. And nowadays, many studies have tried to apply various analytic techniques to the factors identified previously in order to improve the accuracy of prediction and to explain the effect of each factor instead of identifying new factors affecting the box office record. However, most of previous researches have limitations in that they used the total number of audiences from the opening to the end as a target variable, and this makes it difficult to predict and respond to the demand of market which changes dynamically. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to predict the weekly number of audiences of a newly released film so that the stakeholder can flexibly and elastically respond to the change of the number of audiences in the film. To that end, we considered the factors used in the previous studies affecting box office and developed new factors not used in previous studies such as the order of opening of movies, dynamics of sales. Along with the comprehensive factors, we used the machine learning method such as Random Forest, Multi Layer Perception, Support Vector Machine, and Naive Bays, to predict the number of cumulative visitors from the first week after a film release to the third week. At the point of the first and the second week, we predicted the cumulative number of visitors of the forthcoming week for a released film. And at the point of the third week, we predict the total number of visitors of the film.In addition, we predicted the total number of cumulative visitors also at the point of the both first week and second week using the same factors. As a result, we found the accuracy of predicting the number of visitors at the forthcoming week was higher than that of predicting the total number of them in all of three weeks, and also the accuracy of the Random Forest was the highest among the machine learning methods we used. This study has implications in that this study 1) considered various factors comprehensively which affect the box office record and merely addressed by other previous researches such as the weekly rating of audiences after release, the weekly rank of the film after release, and the weekly sales share after release, and 2) tried to predict and respond to the demand of market which changes dynamically by suggesting models which predicts the weekly number of audiences of newly released films so that the stakeholders can flexibly and elastically respond to the change of the number of audiences in the film."

Methods: We retrospectively investigated the medical records of 162 OSA patients who had obesity [body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25] and undertaken successful CPAP titration study. We divided the data to a training set (90%) and a test set (10%), randomly. We made a random forest model and a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) regression model to predict the optimal pressure by using the training set, and then applied our models and previous reported equations to the test set. To compare the fitness of each models, we used a correlation coefficient (CC) and a mean absolute error (MAE). Results: The random forest model showed the best performance {CC 0.78 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43–0.93], MAE 1.20}. The lasso regression model also showed the improved result [CC 0.78 (95% CI 0.42–0.93), MAE 1.26] compared to the Hoffstein equation [CC 0.68 (95% CI 0.23–0.89), MAE 1.34] and the Choi’s equation [CC 0.72 (95% CI 0.30–0.90), MAE 1.40].

Scrambling and island constraints in Korean: An experimental approach,2018,"['island constraints', 'scrambling', 'GLM', 'DD scores', 'random forests']",,"There have been several controversies on the existence of island constraints in Korean. This paper takes an experimental approach to island constraints in Korean and examines the properties of islandhood in Korean. This paper basically adopts the experimental designs in Sprouse et al. (2012, 2014), but one more factor Scramble is also considered in the experiments as in Kim and Goodall (2014). Although the latter study includes only two island constraints (whether island and adjunct island), this paper contains all of four island constraints in the former studies. The experiments are conducted with the magnitude estimation (ME) method, and the acceptability scores are measured with line drawings for one hundred students. After the experiment, the collected data are analyzed with three types of analyses: generalized linear model (GLM), DD scores, and random forests. Through the analysis, the followings are observed: (i) Korean also has island phenomena, (ii) scrambling increases the DD scores in all of four types of island constraints, and (iii) the increases of the DD scores are not due to the violation of island constraints but can be explained by a processing-based account."

It tries to answer the question “Who leaves comments on online news articles or shares news stories with others?” Commenting on news articles and sharing news stories influence news consumption and society at large, but it is not clear who is leaving the comments and sharing the news. This study differs from previous studies because it applies statistical learning in order to obtain the closest answer to reality, not by making assumptions but by using real data. This paper proposes an optimal model for predicting comment writers and news sharers by applying logistic regression analyses, linear/nonlinear discriminant analyses, decision tree models, random forests, and support vector machines. As a result, we could predict the commenters and the sharers with 99% and 94% accuracy, respectively, using random forests. Furthermore, it is reasonable to consider commenters and news sharers the “leaders of the online news culture” because the groups were identified to be almost identical. They were highly educated, politically liberal or moderate, and active in social activities such as signing campaigns and making donations. In addition, people with a lower amount of trust in national news media tended to write comments and share news, and the more socially influential they regard journalists as being, the more likely they are to share news stories. Finally, the leaders of the online news culture spend a significant amount of time on social networking sites and messaging services. Particularly, news commenters consume or participate in new independent media such as podcasts or YouTube videos, and news sharers actively read news from various media, including social networking sites, messaging services, and political magazines."

There are many traditional instruments in Korea, and most of the traditional songs played using the instruments have similar patterns and rhythms. Although music information processing such as music genre classification and audio melody extraction have been studied, most studies have focused on pop, jazz, rock, and other universal genres. There are few studies on Korean traditional music because of the lack of datasets. This paper analyzes raw audio and MIDI phrases in Korean traditional music, performed using Korean traditional musical instruments. The classified samples and MIDI, based on our classification system, will be used to construct a database or to implement our Kontakt-based instrument library. Thus, we can construct a management system for a Korean traditional music library using this classification system. Appropriate feature sets for raw audio and MIDI phrases are proposed and the classification results―based on machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine, multi-layer perception, decision tree, and random forest―are outlined in this paper."

Therefore, the quality inspection of mass-produced products involves automatic checking and classifying by the machines in many processes. Although there are many preceding studies on improving or optimizing the process using the data generated in the production process, there have been many constraints with regard to actual implementation due to the technical limitations of processing a large volume of data in real time. The recent research studies on big data have improved the data processing technology and enabled collecting, processing, and analyzing process data in real time. This paper aims to propose the process and details of applying big data for quality inspection and examine the applicability of the proposed method to the dairy industry. We review the previous studies and propose a big data analysis procedure that is applicable to the manufacturing sector. To assess the feasibility of the proposed method, we applied two methods to one of the quality inspection processes in the dairy industry: convolutional neural network and random forest. We collected, processed, and analyzed the images of caps and straws in real time, and then determined whether the products were defective or not.

KT와 과학기술정보통신부는 2014년부터 국가 R&D사업의 일환으로 축산관련 차량의 이동경로를 분석하여 예측하는 빅데이터사업을 수행하고 있다. 동물감염병 예방을 위하여 연구진은 최초에는 차량이동 데이터를 활용한 회귀분석모델을 기반으로 한 예측모델을 개발하였다. 이후에는 기계학습을 활용하여 좀 더 정확한 예측 모델을 구성하였다.특히, 2017년 예측모델에서는 시설물에 대한 확산 위험도를 추가하였고 모델링의 하이퍼 파라미터를 다양하게고려하여 모델의 성능을 높였다. 정오분류표와 ROC 커브를 확인한 결과, 기계 학습 모델보다 2017년 구성된 모형이 우수함을 확인 할 수 있었다. 또한 2017에는 결과에 대한 설명을 추가하여 방역당국의 의사결정을 돕고이해관계자를 설득할 수 있는 근거를 확보하였다. 본 연구는 빅데이터를 활용하여 동물감염병예방시스템을 구축한 사례연구로 모델주요변수값, 이에따른 실제예측성능결과, 그리고 상세하게 기술된 시스템구축 프로세스는향후 감염병예방 영역의 지속적인 빅데이터활용 및 분석 모델 개발에 기여할 수 있을 것이다. 또한 본 연구에서구축한 시스템을 통해 보다 사전적이고 효과적인 방역을 할 수 있을 것으로 기대한다.","Animal infectious diseases, such as avian influenza and foot and mouth disease, occur almost every year and cause huge economic and social damage to the country. In order to prevent this, the anti-quarantine authorities have tried various human and material endeavors, but the infectious diseases have continued to occur. Avian influenza is known to be developed in 1878 and it rose as a national issue due to its high lethality. Food and mouth disease is considered as most critical animal infectious disease internationally. In a nation where this disease has not been spread, food and mouth disease is recognized as economic disease or political disease because it restricts international trade by making it complex to import processed and non-processed live stock, and also quarantine is costly. In a society where whole nation is connected by zone of life, there is no way to prevent the spread of infectious disease fully. Hence, there is a need to be aware of occurrence of the disease and to take action before it is distributed.Epidemiological investigation on definite diagnosis target is implemented and measures are taken to prevent the spread of disease according to the investigation results, simultaneously with the confirmation of both human infectious disease and animal infectious disease. The foundation of epidemiological investigation is figuring out to where one has been, and whom he or she has met. In a data perspective, this can be defined as an action taken to predict the cause of disease outbreak, outbreak location, and future infection, by collecting and analyzing geographic data and relation data. Recently, an attempt has been made to develop a prediction model of infectious disease by using Big Data and deep learning technology, but there is no active research on model building studies and case reports. KT and the Ministry of Science and ICT have been carrying out big data projects since 2014 as part of national R &D projects to analyze and predict the route of livestock related vehicles. To prevent animal infectious diseases, the researchers first developed a prediction model based on a regression analysis using vehicle movement data. After that, more accurate prediction model was constructed using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Lasso, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest. In particular, the prediction model for 2017 added the risk of diffusion to the facilities, and the performance of the model was improved by considering the hyper-parameters of the modeling in various ways. Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve show that the model constructed in 2017 is superior to the machine learning model. The difference between the2016 model and the 2017 model is that visiting information on facilities such as feed factory and slaughter house, and information on bird livestock, which was limited to chicken and duck but now expanded to goose and quail, has been used for analysis in the later model. In addition, an explanation of the results was added to help the authorities in making decisions and to establish a basis for persuading stakeholders in 2017. This study reports an animal infectious disease prevention system which is constructed on the basis of hazardous vehicle movement, farm and environment Big Data. The significance of this study is that it describes the evolution process of the prediction model using Big Data which is used in the field and the model is expected to be more complete if the form of viruses is put into consideration. This will contribute to data utilization and analysis model development in related field. In addition, we expect that the system constructed in this study will provide more preventive and effective prevention."

For the sake of improving the prediction performance more reliably, the proposed EPNN model is based on various types of activation functions like hyperbolic tangent, linear, and Gaussian functions, all of which are embedded in hidden nodes to improve its performance. In order to verify the validity of the proposed EPNN model, a number of HRV metrics were calculated from 20 valid and qualified participants whose emotions were induced by using money game. To add more rigor to the experiment, the participants’ valence and arousal were checked and used as output node of the EPNN. The experiment results reveal that the F-Measure for Valence and Arousal is 80% and 95%, respectively, proving that the EPNN yields very robust and well-balanced performance. The EPNN performance was compared with competing models like neural network, logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest. The EPNN was more accurate and reliable than those of the competing models.

In previous studies, input variables were selected with reference to past papers or by relying on the intuitions of the researchers. This paper attempts to address this issue by applying the stepwise regression model and the random forest model to the Cape-size bulk carrier market. The Cape market was selected due to the simplicity of its supply and demand structure. The preliminary selection of the determinants resulted in 16 variables. In the next stage, 8 features from the stepwise regression model and 10 features from the random forest model were screened as important determinants. The chosen variables were used to test both models. Based on the analysis of the models, it was observed that the random forest model outperforms the stepwise regression model. This research is significant because it provides a scientific basis which can be used to find the determinants in shipping market forecasting, and utilize a machine-learning model in the process.

A methodology to derive global maps of leaf traits using remote sensing and climate data,2018,"['Plant traits', 'Machine learning', 'Random forests', 'Remote sensing', 'Plant ecology', 'Climate', 'MODIS', 'Landsat']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>This paper introduces a modular processing chain to derive global high-resolution maps of leaf traits. In particular, we present global maps at 500 m resolution of specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen and phosphorus content per dry mass, and leaf nitrogen/phosphorus ratio. The processing chain exploits machine learning techniques along with optical remote sensing data (MODIS/Landsat) and climate data for gap filling and up-scaling of in-situ measured leaf traits. The chain first uses random forests regression with surrogates to fill gaps in the database (> 45<I>%</I> of missing entries) and maximizes the global representativeness of the trait dataset. Plant species are then aggregated to Plant Functional Types (PFTs). Next, the spatial abundance of PFTs at MODIS resolution (500 m) is calculated using Landsat data (30 m). Based on these PFT abundances, representative trait values are calculated for MODIS pixels with nearby trait data. Finally, different regression algorithms are applied to globally predict trait estimates from these MODIS pixels using remote sensing and climate data. The methods were compared in terms of precision, robustness and efficiency. The best model (random forests regression) shows good precision (normalized RMSE≤ 20<I>%</I>) and goodness of fit (averaged Pearson's correlation R = 0.78) in any considered trait. Along with the estimated global maps of leaf traits, we provide associated uncertainty estimates derived from the regression models. The process chain is modular, and can easily accommodate new traits, data streams (traits databases and remote sensing data), and methods. The machine learning techniques applied allow attribution of information gain to data input and thus provide the opportunity to understand trait-environment relationships at the plant and ecosystem scales. The new data products – the gap-filled trait matrix, a global map of PFT abundance per MODIS gridcells and the high-resolution global leaf trait maps – are complementary to existing large-scale observations of the land surface and we therefore anticipate substantial contributions to advances in quantifying, understanding and prediction of the Earth system.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  Presented a modular process chain for plant trait mapping including local effects </LI> <LI>  High-resolution global maps of leaf traits by fusing measured trait data, LANDSAT and MODIS </LI> <LI>  Scope for testing and parameterizing trait-enabled Earth System models </LI> <LI>  Implications for land management and Earth system science applications </LI> </UL> </P>"
A robust proposal generation method for text lines in natural scene images,2018,"['Scene text detection', 'Feature extraction', 'Text line proposals', 'Random Forest']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Motivated by the success of object proposal generation methods for object detection, we propose a novel method for generating text line proposals from natural scene images. Our strategy is to detect text regions which we define as part of text lines containing a whole character or transitions between two adjacent characters. We observe that, if we scale text regions to a small and fixed size, their image gradients exhibit certain patterns irrespective of text shapes and language types. Based on this observation, we propose simple features which consist of means and standard deviations of image gradients to train a Random Forest so as to detect text regions over multiple image scales and color channels. Text regions are then merged into text line candidates which are ranked based on the Random Forest responses combined with the shapes of the candidates, e.g., horizontally elongated candidates are given higher scores, because they are more likely to contain texts. Even though our method is trained on English, our experiments demonstrate that it achieves high recall with a few thousand good quality proposals on four standard benchmarks, including multi-language datasets. Following the One-to-One and Many-to-One detection criteria, our method achieves 91.6%, 87.4%, 92.1% and 97.9% recall on the ICDAR 2013 Robust Reading Dataset, Street View Text Dataset, Pan’s multilingual Dataset and Sampled KAIST Scene Text Dataset respectively, with an average of less than 1250 proposals.</P>"

Thus it is difficult to know how much they are exposed to crime. If the police can predict the crime risky area, it will be possible to cope with the crime efficiently even though insufficient police and enforcement resources. However, there is no prediction system in Korea and the related researches are very much poor. From these backgrounds, the final goal of this study is to develop an automated crime prediction system. However, for the first step, we build a big data set which consists of local real crime information and urban physicalor non-physical data. Then, we developed a crime prediction model through machine learning method. Finally, we assumed several possible scenarios and calculated the probability of crime and visualized the results in a map so as to increase the people's understanding. Among the factors affecting the crime occurrence revealed in previous and case studies, data was processed in the form of a big data for machine learning: real crime information, weather information (temperature, rainfall, wind speed, humidity, sunshine, insolation, snowfall, cloud cover) and local information (average building coverage, average floor area ratio, average building height, number of buildings, average appraised land value, average area of residential building, average number of ground floor). Among the supervised machine learning algorithms, the decision tree model, the random forest model, and the SVM model, which are known to be powerful and accurate in various fields were utilized to construct crime prevention model. As a result, decision tree model with the lowest RMSE was selected as an optimal prediction model. Based on this model, several scenarios were set for theft and violence cases which are the most frequent in the case city J, and the probability of crime was estimated by 250x250m grid. As a result, we could find that the high crime risky area is occurring in three patterns in case city J. The probability of crime was divided into three classes and visualized in map by 250 x 250m grid. Finally, we could develop a crime prediction model using machine learning algorithm and visualized the crime risky areas in a map which can recalculate the model and visualize the result simultaneously as time and urban conditions change."
Vision-based Railway Inspection System using Multiple Object Detection and Image Registration,2018,"['Railway inspection', 'Computer vision', 'Image processing', 'Random forest', 'Registration']",,"Image processing and computer vision techniques have been utilized for safety and maintenance in the railway field. Although a lot of research has been proposed to automatically inspect a facility, most diagnosis for facility maintenance is still dependent on a manager’s subjective judgment. This paper presents a novel railway-inspection system using object detection and image subtraction based on registration. For accurate deformation and defect inspection, the proposed system compares a pair of two high-resolution images acquired by a laser scan camera equipped on a railway vehicle. The proposed system consists of three parts: i) object detection using classifiers learned by random forest, ii) facility position alignment using phase correlation matching, and iii) deformation and defect detection using image registration and subtraction. The proposed inspection system performs automatic inspections by detecting facilities and any deformed regions. Therefore, the proposed system can provide improvement of a maintenance system at a cost reduction."

In each experiment, five susceptibility maps were produced based on support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), weight-of-evidence (WoE), ridge regression (Rid_R), and robust regression (RR) models. The highest accuracy (<I>AUC</I> =0.85) was achieved with the SVM model when either the full or limited landslide inventories were used. Furthermore, the RF and WoE models were severely affected when less landslide samples were used for training. The other models were affected slightly when the training samples were limited.</P>"

In this paper, empirical analysis based on data is performed referring to previous studies. Focusing on the policy interest rate among the factors affecting the housing price, the non-linear impulse responses of other variables to the interest rate shock are analyzed. Using the random forest algorithm, the variable importance scores of the macroeconomic variables presented in the previous studies are calculated. After selecting the variables through this process, the impulse responses are calculated using a model that can capture non-linearity. According to the model, the responses of housing prices to the policy rate is only significant when the rate is raised. Especially, the impulse response is amplified when the shock increases due to the non-linear characteristics that can not be captured by the traditional VAR methodology. The analysis results suggest that the interest rate as a policy instrument should be approached from a more cautious perspective."

Therefore, it is necessary to develop a predictive model to consider not only retail format choice (i.e., national chains or traditional market) but also the possibility of cross-shopping derived from the partial churn. In order to predict retail format choice and degree of cross shopping, the current study used logistic regression analysis, decision tree, random forest, GBM, neural network models, which can be simultaneously used for classification model and regression model. In order for the degree of cross-shopping, the visits to the favorite retail format for each shopper and the visits to the alternative store format were used as dependent variables. The ensemble method such as random forest and boosting were the most superior model in predicting the retail format choice. Through the appropriate use of machine learning method, superior prediction is possible from the retail format choice for each shopper to the degree of the cross shopping, affecting more effective customer relationship management (CRM)."

Evaluating Pedicle-Screw Instrumentation Using Decision-Tree Analysis Based on Pullout Strength,2018,"['Pedicle screws', 'Pullout strength', 'Osteoporosis', 'Machine learning', 'Decision-support']",,"Study Design: A biomechanical study of pedicle-screw pullout strength.Purpose: To develop a decision tree based on pullout strength for evaluating pedicle-screw instrumentation.Overview of Literature: Clinically, a surgeon’s understanding of the holding power of a pedicle screw is based on perioperative intuition (which is like insertion torque) while inserting the screw. This is a subjective feeling that depends on the skill and experience of the surgeon. With the advent of robotic surgery, there is an urgent need for the creation of a patient-specific surgical planning system.A learning-based predictive model is needed to understand the sensitivity of pedicle-screw holding power to various factors.Methods: Pullout studies were carried out on rigid polyurethane foam, representing extremely osteoporotic to normal bone for different insertion depths and angles of a pedicle screw. The results of these experimental studies were used to build a pullout-strength predictor and a decision tree using a machine-learning approach.Results: Based on analysis of variance, it was found that all the factors under study had a significant effect (p <0.05) on the holding power of a pedicle screw. Of the various machine-learning techniques, the random forest regression model performed well in predicting the pullout strength and in creating a decision tree. Performance was evaluated, and a correlation coefficient of 0.99 was obtained between the observed and predicted values. The mean and standard deviation of the normalized predicted pullout strength for the confirmation experiment using the current model was 1.01±0.04.Conclusions: The random forest regression model was used to build a pullout-strength predictor and decision tree. The model was able to predict the holding power of a pedicle screw for any combination of density, insertion depth, and insertion angle for the chosen range. The decision-tree model can be applied in patient-specific surgical planning and a decision-support system for spine-fusion surgery."

Predicting Surgical Complications in Adult Patients Undergoing Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion Using Machine Learning,2018,"['Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion', 'Predicting', 'Complications', 'Machine Learning', 'Spine']",,"Objective: Machine learning algorithms excel at leveraging big data to identify complex patterns that can be used to aid in clinical decision-making. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the performance of machine learning models in predicting postoperative complications following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF).Methods: Artificial neural network (ANN), logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest decision tree (RF) models were trained on a multicenter data set of patients undergoing ACDF to predict surgical complications based on readily available patient data. Following training, these models were compared to the predictive capability of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification.Results: A total of 20,879 patients were identified as having undergone ACDF. Following exclusion criteria, patients were divided into 14,615 patients for training and 6,264 for testing data sets. ANN and LR consistently outperformed ASA physical status classification in predicting every complication (p<0.05). The ANN outperformed LR in predicting venous thromboembolism, wound complication, and mortality (p<0.05). The SVM and RF models were no better than random chance at predicting any of the postoperative complications (p<0.05).Conclusion: ANN and LR algorithms outperform ASA physical status classification for predicting individual postoperative complications. Additionally, neural networks have greater sensitivity than LR when predicting mortality and wound complications. With the growing size of medical data, the training of machine learning on these large datasets promises to improve risk prognostication, with the ability of continuously learning making them excellent tools in complex clinical scenarios."

"Predicting the Potential Distribution of an Invasive Species, Solenopsis invicta Buren (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), under Climate Change using Species Distribution Models",2018,"['Invasive species', 'Quarantine plan', 'Red imported fire ant', 'Solenopsis invicta', 'Species distribution models']",,"The red imported fire ant is considered one of the most notorious invasive species because of its adverse impact on both humans and ecosystems. Public concern regarding red imported fire ants has been increasing, as they have been found seven times in South Korea. Even if red imported fire ants are not yet colonized in South Korea, a proper quarantine plan is necessary to prevent their widespread distribution. As a basis for quarantine planning, we modeled the potential distribution of the red imported fire ant under current climate conditions using six different species distribution models (SDMs) and then selected the random forest (RF) model for modeling the potential distribution under climate change. We acquired occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and bioclimatic data from WorldClim. We modeled at the global scale to project the potential distribution under the current climate and then applied models at the local scale to project the potential distribution of the red imported fire ant under climate change. Modeled results successfully represent the current distribution of red imported fire ants. The potential distribution area for red imported fire ants increased to include major harbors and airports in South Korea under the climate change scenario (RCP 8.5). Thus, we are able to provide a potential distribution of red imported fire ant that is necessary to establish a proper quarantine plan for their management to minimize adverse impacts of climate change."

Molecular Signature for Lymphatic Invasion Associated with Survival of Epithelial Ovarian Cancer,2018,"['Gene expression signature', 'Ovarian neoplasm', 'Human genome', 'Lymphatic metastasis']",,"Purpose We aimed to develop molecular classifier that can predict lymphatic invasion and their clinical significance in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients.Materials and Methods We analyzed gene expression (mRNA, methylated DNA) in data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. To identify molecular signatures for lymphatic invasion, we found differentially expressed genes. The performance of classifier was validated by receiver operating characteristics analysis, logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and support vector machine (SVM). We assessed prognostic role of classifier using random survival forest (RSF) model and pathway deregulation score (PDS). For external validation, we analyzed microarray data from 26 EOC samples of Samsung Medical Center and curatedOvarianData database.Results We identified 21 mRNAs, and seven methylated DNAs from primary EOC tissues that predicted lymphatic invasion and created prognostic models. The classifier predicted lymphatic invasion well, which was validated by logistic regression, LDA, and SVM algorithm (C-index of 0.90, 0.71, and 0.74 for mRNA and C-index of 0.64, 0.68, and 0.69 for DNA methylation).Using RSF model, incorporating molecular data with clinical variables improved prediction of progression-free survival compared with using only clinical variables (p < 0.001 and p=0.008). Similarly, PDS enabled us to classify patients into high-risk and low-risk group, which resulted in survival difference in mRNA profiles (log-rank p-value=0.011). In external validation, gene signature was well correlated with prediction of lymphatic invasion and patients’ survival.Conclusion Molecular signature model predicting lymphatic invasion was well performed and also associated with survival of EOC patients."

An Intelligent System Approach for Probabilistic Volume Rendering Using Hierarchical 3D Convolutional Sparse Coding,2018,,,"<P>In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning-based voxel classification method for highly-accurate volume rendering. Unlike conventional voxel classification methods that incorporate intensity-based features, the proposed method employs dictionary based features learned directly from the input data using hierarchical multi-scale 3D convolutional sparse coding, a novel extension of the state-of-the-art learning-based sparse feature representation method. The proposed approach automatically generates high-dimensional feature vectors in up to 75 dimensions, which are then fed into an intelligent system built on a random forest classifier for accurately classifying voxels from only a handful of selection scribbles made directly on the input data by the user. We apply the probabilistic transfer function to further customize and refine the rendered result. The proposed method is more intuitive to use and more robust to noise in comparison with conventional intensity-based classification methods. We evaluate the proposed method using several synthetic and real-world volume datasets, and demonstrate the methods usability through a user study.</P>"

The paper is facing and evaluating two methods to classify this additional lane information. Therefore the images from five cameras mounted around the car are used. Four of them with fisheye lenses. The methods have in common, that the input images are transformed into a bird view projection. First introduced method is to extract contours from the transformed images and collect geometrical features and Fourier coefficients. The second introduced way, is to calculate histograms of oriented gradients and use it as input for the classification step. Both classification approaches are implemented and evaluated as multiclass and single class detectors for each arrow type. Furthermore, the classification results from a support vector machine and random forest were faced for this classification problem. The results from the multiclass detectors are evaluated and presented in form of confusion matrices. With the introduced approaches a high detection confidence could be achieved, proofed with validation datasets and in practical use."

In this study, we constructed an automatic recognition system for facial expressions through two steps - a facial recognition step and a classification step. We compared various models with different sets of data with pixel information, landmark coordinates, Euclidean distances among landmark points, and arctangent angles. We found a fast and efficient prediction model with only 30 principal components of face landmark information. We applied several prediction models, that included linear discriminant analysis (LDA), random forests, support vector machine (SVM), and bagging; consequently, an SVM model gives the best result. The LDA model gives the second best prediction accuracy but it can fit and predict data faster than SVM and other methods.

Resource Prediction for Big Data Processing in a Cloud Data Center,2018,"['Machine learning techniques', 'Data centers', 'Workload forecasting', 'Energy-aware systems', 'Time series data']",,"The high demand for big data applications, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), healthcare, business, and academia, as well as government, fosters the creation of large-scale cloud data centers. Cloud data centers contain thousands of physical machines (PMs), so resource management is necessary for allocating the tremendous amount of data to them. Knowing the workload demand in advance enables control of those resources, saving energy, reducing CPU and memory usage, and improving service. Workload prediction can be used to determine how many resources need to be allocated in the future. In this paper, we propose machine learning–based techniques to predict the daily operational workload. The proposed approach can predict the amount of power consumption (PC) and the number of PMs required to fulfill the demands of the cloud data center. Workload prediction accuracy varies based on the prediction methods used and the type of workload. In this work, we investigate three different methods: polynomial regression, support vector regression, and random forest regression (RFR). Considering both accuracy and computation time, results show that RFR provides the best performance, in our case, with a minimum root-mean-square error of 11.68 for PMs and 4869.08 for PC prediction.

Evaluation of summer passive microwave sea ice concentrations in the Chukchi Sea based on KOMPSAT-5 SAR and numerical weather prediction data,2018,"['Sea ice concentration', 'Sea ice algorithm', 'Passive microwave sensor', 'KOMPSAT-5', 'Synthetic aperture radar', 'Numerical weather prediction', 'Chukchi Sea']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Satellite passive microwave (PM) sensors have observed sea ice in Polar Regions and provided sea ice concentration (SIC) data since the 1970s. SIC has been used as a primary data source for climate change prediction and ship navigation. However, the accuracy of PM SIC is typically low and biased in summer. To provide more accurate information for climatic research and ship navigation, it is necessary to evaluate quantitatively the accuracy of PM SIC and to account for its errors. In this research, we evaluated the SIC data derived from PM measurements using four representative sea ice algorithms: NASA Team (NT), Bootstrap (BT), Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSISAF) hybrid, and Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction STudy (ARTIST) Sea Ice (ASI). Analyses were performed for the Chukchi Sea in summer using KOrean Multi-Purpose SATellite-5 (KOMPSAT-5) Enhanced Wide-swath synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Ice/water maps were generated by binary classification of texture features in the SAR images based on Random Forest, a rule-based machine learning approach. SIC values estimated from the sea ice algorithms showed good correlation with those calculated from the KOMPSAT-5 ice/water maps, but the root mean square error was larger than 10%. SIC values estimated from the algorithms showed different error trends according to the KOMPSAT-5 SIC range. All algorithms overestimated SIC values in open drift ice zones (KOMPSAT-5 SICs ranged from 0% to 15%). In marginal ice zones (SICs ranged from 15% to 80%), the OSISAF SIC values were the least biased compared to those from KOMPSAT-5. The NT algorithm largely underestimated SIC values in marginal ice zones, while the BT and ASI algorithms overestimated them considerably. All algorithms, except for BT, underestimated SIC in consolidated pack ice zones (SICs ranged from 80% to 100%). By analyzing the correlations of biases of SIC from the algorithms with the numerical weather prediction (NWP) data from the European Reanalysis Agency Interim reanalysis, it was found that the overestimation of NT and ASI SICs was largely influenced by atmospheric water vapor content, while the underestimation of NT and OSISAF SICs was owing to ice surface melting. The overestimation of BT SICs was not significantly correlated with the NWP data. The underestimated SIC from the BT and ASI algorithms for high SIC regions might be compensated by the atmospheric water vapor content. The differences in SIC values estimated from each algorithm were due to different sensitivities to atmospheric water vapor content in the regions with KOMPSAT-5 SIC lower than 40% and to ice surface melting in the regions with higher KOMPSAT-5 SIC.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  Summer sea ice concentration (SIC) was derived from KOMPSAT-5 SAR ice/water maps. </LI> <LI>  SICs from four sea ice algorithms for passive microwave measurements were evaluated. </LI> <LI>  SICs from the algorithms show different error trends by the KOMPSAT-5 SIC ranges. </LI> <LI>  Bias from algorithms' SICs was analyzed by using numerical weather prediction data. </LI> <LI>  SIC products by the algorithms are highly inaccurate for the Chukchi Sea in summer. </LI> </UL> </P>"
Prediction of concrete compressive strength using non-destructive test results,2018,"['concrete', 'compressive strength', 'machine learning regression', 'non-destructive testing']",,"Concrete which is a composite material is one of the most important construction materials. Compressive strength is a commonly used parameter for the assessment of concrete quality. Accurate prediction of concrete compressive strength is an important issue. In this study, we utilized an experimental procedure for the assessment of concrete quality. Firstly, the concrete mix was prepared according to C 20 type concrete, and slump of fresh concrete was about 20 cm. After the placement of fresh concrete to formworks, compaction was achieved using a vibrating screed. After 28 day period, a total of 100 core samples having 75 mm diameter were extracted. On the core samples pulse velocity determination tests and compressive strength tests were performed. Besides, Windsor probe penetration tests and Schmidt hammer tests were also performed. After setting up the data set, twelve artificial intelligence (AI) models compared for predicting the concrete compressive strength. These models can be divided into three categories (i) Functions (i.e., Linear Regression, Simple Linear Regression, Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vector Regression), (ii) Lazy-Learning Algorithms (i.e., IBk Linear NN Search, KStar, Locally Weighted Learning) (iii) Tree- Based Learning Algorithms (i.e., Decision Stump, Model Trees Regression, Random Forest, Random Tree, Reduced Error Pruning Tree). Four evaluation processes, four validation implements (i.e., 10-fold cross validation, 5-fold cross validation, 10% split sample validation & 20% split sample validation) are used to examine the performance of predictive models. This study shows that machine learning regression techniques are promising tools for predicting compressive strength of concrete."

According to previous studies, taken together, one can see that different factors are considered depending on stock markets and prediction periods. This paper aims to analyze what data mining techniques show better performance with some representative index and stock price datasets in the Korea stock market. In particular, extreme gradient boosting technique, proving itself to be the fore-runner through recent open competitions, is applied to the prediction problem. Its performance has been analyzed in comparison with other data mining techniques reported good in the prediction of stock price movement directions such as random forests, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks. Through experiments with the index/price datasets of 12 years, it is identified that the gradient boosting technique is the best in predicting the movement directions after 1 to 4 days with a few partial equivalence to the other techniques."

A software classification scheme using binary-level characteristics for efficient software filtering,2018,,,"<P>Software filtering systems can be employed to detect and filter out pirated or counterfeit software on the Web sites and peer-to-peer networks. They determine whether a suspicious program is legal or not by comparing it with original programs in a database or in the market. To identify pirated or counterfeit software, software filtering systems need to measure software similarity when comparing a suspicious program with original ones. In this case, the comparison overhead might be very high because the suspicious program is compared with all programs in the database or market in the worst case. This paper proposes a software classification scheme for efficient software filtering systems. The scheme focuses specifically on the Windows portable executable files which have been prime targets for software pirates. The scheme extracts software characteristics from a suspicious program and classifies it into one of pre-defined categories quickly based on the characteristics. The suspicious program is compared only with the programs in the one of pre-defined categories in most cases; thus, the comparison overhead is reduced. We propose two classification methods. The first one extracts strings from GUI-related resources of a program and computes the relevance of the program to each category based on the pre-computed score of the strings. The second one extracts API call frequency from a program's execution codes and uses Random Forest technique to classify the program. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can classify programs effectively and can reduce the comparison overhead significantly.</P>"
Probabilistic Convective Initiation Nowcasting with Reduced Satellite - NWP Predictors over Iran,2018,"['Satellite .NWPmodel', 'Convective initiation', 'Dimensional reduction', 'Nowcasting']",,"Geostationary satellites are able to nowcast Convective Initiation (CI) for the next 0–6 h. Compared to using satellite predictors only, the incorporation of satellite and NumericalWeather Prediction (NWP) predictors can provide the possibility to reduce false alarm rates in 0–1:30 Convective Initiation Nowcasting (COIN). However, the correlation among these predictors not only can cause error in COIN, but also increases the runtime. In this study for the first time, all effective predictors in Satellite Convection Analysis and Tracking version 2 (SATCASTv2) and NWP were applied over Iran from22ndMarch 2015 to 9th January 2016. In applying SATCASTv2 over Iran, it was necessary to make some modifications to the algorithm, such as removing case specific thresholds of satellite predictors and rearranging COIN predictors. Then, SATCASTv2 was tested and evaluated with both the full and reduced set of predictors. The results suggested that using fixed thresholds for temporal difference predictors could miss COIN in some cases. To investigate the possibility of improving computational efficiency, a dimension reduction was conducted by Factor Analysis (FA) and the number of predictors was reduced from 22 to 11. TheNWP-satellite, reduced NWP-satellite, and satellite predictors were used as input in Random Forest (RF), as a parametric machine learning method, for COIN evaluation.The Combination ofNWP model and satellite predictors had lower false alarm rates in contrast with satellite predictors. This is in agreement with previous studies. The results from statistical metrics showed that the reduced NWP-satellite predictors had comparable performance to the NWP-satellite predictors over study area, but decreased the run time by almost 50%. The results indicated that Convective Inhibition (CIN) was the most significant predictor when the reduced set of predictors was used."

However, because of their similar appearance, it is difficult to distinguish between part-solid GGN and pure GGN when the part-solid GGN includes small solid components. In this paper, we propose a multi-class classification method for GGN using multiview-slab region of interest (ROI)-based features and data augmentation. First, data augmentation is performed to enlarge the training dataset of the classifier and to avoid the overfitting problem. Second, four ROIs are generated from a GGN. Third, features that reflect the characteristics of the solid component are extracted from each ROI, and significant features are selected for classification. Finally, GGNs are classified using the random forest (RF). In the experiments, the classification accuracy with 2.5-dimensional multiview-slab ROI was 84.05%, which was 6.27% and 4.44% higher than the classification accuracy with 3-dimensional ROI and 2.5-dimensional ROI, respectively."

However, the relationship between these factors and flood damages is yet to be investigated due to the lack of systematic post-disaster surveys. Therefore, we conducted a field survey focused on damaged single family houses and collected data about the factors influencing flood damages. The data was analyzed to evaluate the relationship between various influencing factors and flood damage by using correlation analysis, decision tree model, and random forest method. Through the analyses, the major factors influencing building structure damages were found to be the inundation depth and height of the entrance. Moreover, the inundation depth, debris, and flow velocity were identified as the major factors influencing the building content damages. In the future, it is necessary to explore ways to enhance the resilience of buildings and reduce the influence of major factors by establishing local flood mitigation measures."
Rural Systems Visioneering: Paradigm Shift from Flux Measurement to Sustainability Science,2018,"['Sustainability science', 'Ecological-societal systems', 'Self-organization', 'Rural systems visioneering', 'Sustainable Development Goals Lab']",,"Sustainability science is an emerging transdisciplinary research which necessitates not only the communication and collaboration of scientists, practitioners and stakeholders from different disciplines and interests, but also the paradigm shift from deterministic and reductionist approaches to the old basic. Ecological-societal systems (ESS) are co-evolving complex systems having many interacting parts (or agents) whose random interactions at local scale give rise to spontaneous emerging order at global scale (i.e., self-organization). Here, the flows of energy, matter and information between the systems and their surroundings play a key role. We introduce a conceptual framework for such continually morphing dynamical systems, i.e. self-organizing hierarchical open systems (SOHOs). To understand the structure and functionality of SOHOs, we revisit the two fundamental laws of physics. Re-interpretation of these principles helps understand the destiny and better path toward sustainability, and how to reconcile ecosystem integrity with societal vision and value. We then integrate the so-called visioneering (V) framework with that of SOHOs as feedback/feedforward loops so that 'a nudged self-organization' may guide systems' agents to work together toward sustainable ESS. Finally, example is given with newly endorsed Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Lab (i.e., 'Rural systems visioneering') by Future Earth, which is now underway in rural villages in Tanzania."

We analyzed how the scale of expenditure budget affects employment rate changes. 13 sectors of expenditure budget are categorized to achieve this goal. The local employment rates data, which is provided by the Statistical department, is used for the proxy of employment effects.As a result, the budget scale of general administration and the agricultural/forest/fishery areas are positively related with employment rates and contributed toward job creation spurring local economies. Meanwhile, those of education, industry, and local development are negatively related with employment rates. However, the areas of health and transportation are not significantly related to employment rates. These findings are consistent with previous studies that showed the scale of local budget expenditure raises employment rates.This study shows that policy decisions of the local government can affect the local employment rate. These results will provide insight to local policy makers for creating local jobs and guarantee job securities."
