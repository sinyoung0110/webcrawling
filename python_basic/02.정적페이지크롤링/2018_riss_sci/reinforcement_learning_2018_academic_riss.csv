Controller Learning Method of Self-driving Bicycle Using State-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms,2018,"['Reinforcement Learning', 'DDPG', 'Machine Learning', 'Bicycle Self Balancing', 'Deep Learning']",,"Recently, there have been many studies on machine learning. Among them, studies on reinforcement learning are actively worked. In this study, we propose a controller to control bicycle using DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) algorithm which is the latest deep reinforcement learning method. In this paper, we redefine the compensation function of bicycle dynamics and neural network to learn agents. When using the proposed method for data learning and control, it is possible to perform the function of not allowing the bicycle to fall over and reach the further given destination unlike the existing method. For the performance evaluation, we have experimented that the proposed algorithm works in various environments such as fixed speed, random, target point, and not determined. Finally, as a result, it is confirmed that the proposed algorithm shows better performance than the conventional neural network algorithms NAF and PPO."
Reinforcement Learning-based Duty Cycle Interval Control in Wireless Sensor Networks,2018,"['Duty cycle', 'Wireless Sensor Networks', 'Q-learning', 'Delay bound']",,"One of the distinct features of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is duty cycling mechanism, which is used to conserve energy and extend the network lifetime. Large duty cycle interval introduces lower energy consumption, meanwhile longer end-to-end (E2E) delay. In this paper, we introduce an energy consumption minimization problem for duty-cycled WSNs. We have applied Q-learning algorithm to obtain the maximum duty cycle interval which supports various delay requirements and given Delay Success ratio (DSR) i.e. the required probability of packets arriving at the sink before given delay bound. Our approach only requires sink to compute Q-leaning which makes it practical to implement. Nodes in the different group have the different duty cycle interval in our proposed method and nodes don’t need to know the information of the neighboring node. Performance metrics show that our proposed scheme outperforms existing algorithms in terms of energy efficiency while assuring the required delay bound and DSR."

Recognition of Human Motion with Deep Reinforcement Learning,2018,"['Gesture recognition', 'IoT device', 'Feature extraction', 'End-to-end process', 'Deep reinforcement learning', 'Deep Q-network (DQN)', 'Double DQN']",,"Human.computer interaction (HCI) has become an important research area for improving the user experience on Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In particular, gesture recognition and dailyactivity recognition have attracted the interest of numerous researchers. Human motions have been predicted by analyzing accelerometer data from which features were extracted to be classified into a specific activity. However, due to the memory limitations of IoT devices, it is hard to utilize all the raw data from an accelerometer sensor. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to recognize human arm movements using a commercial wearable device, the Myo armband. Agents learn the patterns that are the acceleration data of human motion. In addition, using raw accelerometer sensor data without feature extraction could make an end-to-end structure. In order to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, a deep neural network (DNN) and a deep reinforcement learning algorithm are compared. As a result, a deep reinforcement learning agent yielded accuracy similar to a DNN using less data, and the agent could learn time-series human motion acceleration data."

Reinforcement Q-learning based on Multirate Generalized Policy Iteration and Its Application to a 2-DOF Helicopter,2018,"['Adaptive optimal control', 'linear quadratic regulation', 'multirate generalized policy iteration', 'Q-learning']",,"In this paper, we propose a novel Q-learning method based on multirate generalized policy iteration (MGPI) for unknown discrete-time (DT) linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problems. Q-learning is an effective scheme for unknown dynamical systems because it does not require any knowledge of the system dynamics to solve optimal control problems. By applying the MGPI concept, which is an extension of basic GPI with multirate time horizon steps, a new Q-learning algorithm is proposed for solving the LQR problem. Further, it is proven that the proposed algorithm converges to an optimal solution i.e., it learns the optimal control policy iteratively using the states and the control-input information. Finally, we employ the two degree-of-freedom helicopter model to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and investigate its convergence properties."

Post-CCA and Reinforcement Learning Based Bandwidth Adaptation in 802.11ac Networks,2018,,,"<P>The new 802.11ac standard aims at achieving Gbps data throughput for individual users by exploiting enhanced physical-layer features, such as higher modulation levels, Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO), and wider bandwidths. However, the heterogeneity of bandwidth in a network can cause asymmetric interferences in which certain transmissions cannot be sensed by some other nodes. As a result, the conventional Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) may not work well in 802.11ac networks. We call this the <I>Hidden Channel</I> (HC) problem, which is shown to be <I>real</I> via experiments with USRP and WARP boards. To solve this problem, we propose bandwidth adaptation based on <I>post-CCA</I>, which is a clear channel assessment (CCA) procedure performed <I>after</I> completing a transmission. Post-CCA in wireless networks helps mimic the CSMA with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) mechanism in the wired Ethernet, thus enhancing channel assessment capability. Using post-CCA, we propose Post-CCA based Bandwidth Adaptation (PoBA) that alters bandwidth and channel configuration dynamically by applying a reinforcement learning mechanism. Post-CCA and PoBA do not require any hardware modification and are also compliant with the 802.11 standards. PoBA is shown via simulation to increase network-wide throughput, channel utilization and fairness, and also lower packet error probability.</P>"

To identify the response mechanism, including the classification of failure mode and the prediction of associated shear strength, of beam-column joints, this paper introduces the application of machine learning techniques. The efficiency of various machine learning techniques is evaluated using extensive experimental data from 536 experimental tests, all of which exhibited either non-ductile joint shear failure prior to beam yielding or ductile joint shear failure after beam yielding. It has been seen from the comparison that lasso regression has a better efficiency and reasonable accuracy in the classification and prediction.

AI기법의 Q-Learning을 이용한 최적 퇴선 경로 산출 연구,2018,"['Abandon Ship', 'Evacuation', 'Machine Learning', 'Reinforcement Learning', 'Q-Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence', '퇴선', '피난', '기계학습', '강화학습', 'Q-Learning', '인공지능']","선박은 해양사고 발생 시 최악의 경우 퇴선을 해야 하나 특성상 협소하고 복잡하며 해상에서 운항하므로 퇴선이 쉽지 않다. 특히, 여객선의 경우 해상에서의 안전훈련을 이수하지 않은 불특정 다수의 승객들로 인해 더욱 퇴선이 어려운 상황이 된다. 이런 경우 승무원들의 피난 유도가 상당히 중요한 역할을 하게 된다. 그리고 구조자가 사고 선박에 진입하여 구조 활동을 하는 경우 어느 구역으로 진입해야 가장 효과적인지에 대한 검토가 필요하다. 일반적으로 승무원 및 구조자는 최단경로를 택하여 이동하는 것이 일반적이나 최단 경로에 사고 상황 등이 발생했을 경우 제2의 최적 경로 선택이 필요하다. 이러한 상황을 해결하기 위해 이 연구에서는 머신러닝(Machine learning)의 기법 중에 하나인 강화학습(Reinforcement Learning)의 Q-Learning 이용하여 퇴선 경로를 산출하고자 한다. 강화학습은 인공지능(Artificial Intelligence)의 가장 핵심적인 기능으로 현재 여러 분야에 사용되고 있다. 현재까지 개발된 대부분의 피난분석 프로그램은 최단 경로를 탐색하는 기법을 사용하고 있다. 이 연구에서는 최단경로가 아닌 최적경로를 분석하기 위해 머신러닝의 강화학습 기법을 이용하였다. 향후 AI기법인 머신러닝은 자율운항선박의 최적항로 선정 및 위험요소 회피 등 다양한 해양관련 산업에 적용 가능할 것이다.","In the worst maritime accidents, people should abandon ship, but ship structures are narrow and complex and operation takes place on rough seas, so escape is not easy. In particular, passengers on cruise ships are untrained and varied, making evacuation prospects worse. In such a case, the evacuation management of the crew plays a very important role. If a rescuer enters a ship at distress and conducts rescue activities, which zones represent the most effective entry should be examined. Generally, crew and rescuers take the shortest route, but if an accident occurs along the shortest route, it is necessary to select the second-best alternative. To solve this situation, this study aims to calculate evacuation routes using Q-Learning of Reinforcement Learning, which is a machine learning technique. Reinforcement learning is one of the most important functions of artificial intelligence and is currently used in many fields. Most evacuation analysis programs developed so far use the shortest path search method. For this reason, this study explored optimal paths using reinforcement learning. In the future, machine learning techniques will be applicable to various marine-related industries for such purposes as the selection of optimal routes for autonomous vessels and risk avoidance."

To address the goal, this author examines what kind of teaching method flipped learning is grounded on theories and discusses how to apply it to speaking class intensively. Also, as a type of discourse, this researcher looks into the concept and characteristics of speechmaking and establishes the elements of contents for teaching speechmaking. According to the results about the components of contents for teaching speechmaking, this study has drawn ability to understand the types of discourse throughout the class, ability to recognize speaking situations, ability to construct contents, ability to express and deliver messages, and ability to cultivate public confidence. Based on that, this author has designed class steps and activities appropriately changing the general procedure of flipped learning class to that of speaking class and suggested a class model for speechmaking based on how it has been designed. As a step before class, ‘being ready for speaking activity’ is devised, as a step during class, ‘being involved in discourse activity independently’ is designed, and as a step after class, ‘reinforcing and internalizing speaking activity’ is come up with. Based on that, this researcher suggests a model for speechmaking class."
Dysfunctional Social Reinforcement Processing in Disruptive Behavior Disorders: An Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study,2018,"['Disruptive behavior disorder', 'Social reward', 'Ventral striatum', 'Posterior cingulate cortex', 'Caudate', 'Ventro-medial prefrontal cortex.']",,"Objective: Prior functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) work has revealed that children/adolescents with disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs) show dysfunctional reward/non-reward processing of non-social reinforcements in the context of instrumental learning tasks. Neural responsiveness to social reinforcements during instrumental learning, despite the importance of this for socialization, has not yet been previously investigated.Methods: Twenty-nine healthy children/adolescents and 19 children/adolescents with DBDs performed the fMRI social/ non-social reinforcement learning task. Participants responded to random fractal image stimuli and received social and non-social rewards/non-rewards according to their accuracy.Results: Children/adolescents with DBDs showed significantly reduced responses within the caudate and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) to non-social (financial) rewards and social non-rewards (the distress of others). Connectivity analyses revealed that children/adolescents with DBDs have decreased positive functional connectivity between the ventral striatum (VST) and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) seeds and the lateral frontal cortex in response to reward relative to non-reward, irrespective of its sociality. In addition, they showed decreased positive connectivity between the vmPFC seed and the amygdala in response to non-reward relative to reward.Conclusion: These data indicate compromised reinforcement processing of both non-social rewards and social non-rewards in children/adolescents with DBDs within core regions for instrumental learning and reinforcement-based decision- making (caudate and PCC). In addition, children/adolescents with DBDs show dysfunctional interactions between the VST, vmPFC, and lateral frontal cortex in response to rewarded instrumental actions potentially reflecting disruptions in attention to rewarded stimuli."

Q-learning is a popular reinforcement learning method, and is used much for robot learning for its characteristics which are simple, convergent and little affected by the training environment (off-policy). In this paper, Q-learning algorithm is applied to a lamp robot to learn multiple behaviors (human recognition, desk object recognition).

Neurological Nunction and Educational Implications of Oxytocin,2018,"['Oxytocin', 'Social behavior', 'Amygdala', 'Empathy', 'Functional MRI(fMRI)', 'Isolation']",,"This study examines the neurological functions of oxytocin and aims to reveal educational implications based on the neurological functions of oxytocin. People feel as satisfied and delighted with social rewards as they do with material rewards. Therefore, various social behaviors are carried out. Especially, adolescence is greatly influenced by social exchange in peer group. If they are not selected or recognized by peer groups, they experience emotional problems such as anxiety, depression, and isolation. In the field of neurophysiology, 'Oxytocin' is proposed as a substance related to sociality. Therefore, in this study, we confirmed the neurobiological function of oxytocin in relation to the social brain.Oxytocin improves empathy of people with low social cognitive abilities, recognizes emotions and increases social behavior. It also functions to reinforce social cohesion, such as reducing the sense of rejection toward others and improving the sense of trust. Oxytocin lowers the activity of amygdala, which is related to the fear of the subject and the fear response, to reduce the rejection and increase the confidence of the stranger. It strengthens motives such as pleasure and satisfaction due to social rewards in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the nucleus accumbens. Adolescence has widened the scope of social exchanges, and as the desire for belonging grows stronger, it causes severe suffering due to isolation. We recognize that such problems are the problem of the whole class, and we must work together to improve them. By actively engaging in social interaction and enhancing the secretion of oxytocin, it is expected that they can form a class culture that empathizes with each other and forms bonds with each other rather than against each other."

Six adaptation methods were applied to the process, such as simplifying, deleting, adding, rearranging, rewriting, and restructuring, which were chosen based on the analysis of the development principles and the characteristics of the MOOC course. The adaptation methods reflected the limitation of time, simplicity of construction and the need for communication in the operation of the MOOC.

Design of Reinforced Interval Type-2 Fuzzy C-Means-Based Fuzzy Classifier,2018,,,"<P>This paper is concerned with a new design methodology of a reinforced interval type-2 fuzzy c-means (FCM) based fuzzy classifier (FC). The key point of this study is to reduce the computational complexity of type-2 fuzzy set-based models and to alleviate the deterioration of its generalization abilities through the synergistic effect of two algorithms: First, interval type-2 FCM (IT2FCM) is used in the hidden layer of the network and connections (weights) are adjusted by invoking the least squares error estimation method. Second, an L<SUB>2</SUB>-norm regularization is considered in the cost function to avoid the construction of the network suffering from overfitting. In more detail, the hidden layer of the proposed FC is realized by interval type-2 FCM clustering to deal with the factor of uncertainty involved in the problem. This type of clustering is realized by using two values of the fuzzification coefficient resulting in the interval type-2 membership functions. Once completing type reduction, the membership grades of IT2FCM are used as the outputs of the hidden layer. Instead of the backpropagation training, least squares estimator based learning is applied to adjust the functional connection being regarded as linear functions mapping the hidden layer to the output layer. In order to reduce potential overfitting, L<SUB>2</SUB>-norm regularization is taken into account. The effectiveness of the proposed classifier is analyzed with the aid of a number of machine learning datasets as well as face image datasets. Thorough comparative studies are also included.</P>"

But reinforcement learning has high computational complexity and needs a lot of time to get solution, so it is not easily applicable to uncertain and continuous environments. To tackle the complexity problem, AC (actor-critic) method is used and it separates an action-value function into a value function and an action decision policy. Also, in transfer learning method, the knowledge constructed in one environment is adapted to another environment, so it reduces the time to learn in a reinforcement learning method. In this paper, we present AC method and transfer learning method to solve the problem of a reinforcement learning method. Finally, we analyze the case study which a transfer learning method is used to solve  BS(base station) switching problem in wireless access networks."

Currently, various media are introduced in the course of teaching - learning communication, which serves as a mediator between instructors, learners, learners and learners. In the emergence of social media, how to effectively utilize such pervasiveness media in the educational field, how to establish a harmonious relationship with the media environment, and what is the creative relationship between education, human, and media in the media environment and what is to be applied. Social learning is a combination of social networking and e-learning in a broad sense, reinforcing social interaction. It is a new model for producing, sharing, searching, consuming and learning information through collaborative activities. Because social effects are linked to learning, social media that support collaboration tools are the main basis for social learning, and social networking media such as blogs, Facebook, YouTube are the main learning platforms. Because social learning has the characteristics of context-based knowledge enhancement, extension of connectivity through network, and social diffusion of collaboration, it is necessary to use context, connectivity, And collaboration.

By doing so, they are expected to be able to evaluate their learning results as well. However, even though the policy on ‘self-directed learning’ was once emphasized in 1990’s, it was not able to be in practice due to its vagueness. Now, along with the new curriculum, primary physical education classes should take the ‘self-directed learning’ from 2018, and there are arguments against this matter. ‘Reinforcement of student’s motivation’ and ‘unrealistic and irresponsible education’ are the conflicting opinions. For this reason, this study was carried out to see the possibility of the ‘self-directed learning’ in primary physical education classes. Interviews with teachers and researches on references were covered. The result of this study was as follows: the future society needs people with self-directedness. Therefore, we have to help students likewise. The main reason for the self-directed learning is for the students to be intrinsically motivated. Moreover, through the meta-cognition process, they should learn how to set goals and perform self-directed learning based on their abilities. It is teachers’ role to encourage students with patience so they can overcome the obstacles. Educational Authorities should do its best. It should put its greatest effort, so that self-directed learning textbooks can be published. It should also support experts to develop appropriate teaching and learning contents."

이봉창 전기를 활용한 자아정체성 탐구 학습,2018,"['자아정체성', '이봉창', '전기', '가교로서의 정체성', '대안적 정체성', 'Self-identity', 'Lee Bong-chang', 'Biography', 'Identity as a Bridge', 'Alternative Identity']","역사교육에서 정체성을 다루는 것은 민감한 사안이지만, 그것을 회피해서는 안 된다. 학교 역사교육에서 정체성 문제를 다루지 않는다고 해도, 정체성은 학생들이 역사를 이해하고 평가하는 기반으로 작동한다. 역사교육은 국가･민족･종교 등 거대 집단의 정체성을 함양하는데서 벗어나, 갈등 속의 다른 집단에 대한 편견을 줄이고 서로를 연결시켜 주는 정체성들을 발전시키는데 기여해야 한다. 종교라는 하나의 기준으로 세계를 분할함으로 인해 일어나는 테러와 전쟁을 통해서도 잘 알 수 있듯이, 특정 집단의 단일한 정체성을 바탕으로 세상을 인식하는 것은 갈등과 폭력을 일으키는 근본적인 원인이다.집단 정체성의 함양에서 벗어나 개인의 정체성 변화･형성 과정을 탐구하는 학습은 세 가지 목표가 있다. 먼저 학생들이 과거의 사람들이 동일한 가치와 사고방식을 가졌다는 잘못된 생각을 가지지 않고, 특정 공동체의 구성원들이 각기 다양성을 가지고 있다는 것을 인식하게 해야 한다. 이는 다원적 민주주의 사회의 시민성을 함양하는데 도움을 줄 것이다. 다음으로 학생들이 개인이라는 작은 대상에 대한 세밀한 탐구를 통해 거시적 주제의 맥락과 의미를 더 잘 이해할 수 있도록 해야 한다. 이는 ‘공식적 역사’의 권위와 학습 내용의 ‘단순화･축소’로 인해, 역사적으로 중요한 주제에서 배제되거나 왜곡된 역사적 사실을 파악하게 해 줄 것이다. 이 학습의 마지막 목표는 학생들이 학습의 대상이 되는 인물과 공감하는 동시에 개인과 집단･구조 간의 역동적인 관계를 파악하는 것이다. 이를 통해 학생들은 현재 자신들의 삶과 사회적 변화가 무관하지 않음을 인지하게 되며, 이는 학생들의 사회적 참여의 가능성을 높여준다.우리가 소속한 집단으로 인해 생겨난 특정한 사회적 정체성이 갈등과 폭력을 조장한다고 해도, 그것을 완전히 제거하기는 어렵다. 하지만 우리는 문제가 되는 정체성과 경쟁하는 ‘대안적 정체성’을 인식하고 강화함으로써, 문제를 완화할 수는 있다. 역사교육에서도 우리와 그들을 구별하는 정체성을 강조하는 데서 벗어나, 우리와 그들을 연결시켜주는 ‘가교(架橋)’ 역할을 할 정체성을 발굴하고 형성하는데 노력할 필요가 있다. 과거의 타인이 가진 다양한 정체성들을 탐구하는 과정을 통해, 학생들은 타인과 자신이 연결되는 지점을 찾아가는 경험을 해나갈 수 있다. 이러한 노력은 정체성을 협소화시키려는 시도에 비해서는 자신뿐만 아니라 타인에 대한 이해를 증진시킬 것이며, 조금 더 사회를 평화롭게 만들 것이다. 이 글에서 사례로 제시한 독립운동사 학습의 경우, 학생들의 반응에서도 확인할 수 있듯이 독립운동가들의 위대함을 강조하는 것보다는 독립운동가들과 현재 학생들의 공유점을 만들어 나가는 것이 오히려 공동체에 대한 헌신과 참여를 촉진할 수 있다.","Discussing identity in history education is a sensitive issue, but it should not be avoided. Although history classes do not address identity issues, identity serves as a basis for students to understand and appreciate history. History education should contribute to the development of identities that reduce bias among conflict groups and connect one another, beyond its conventional role, cultivating the identity of large groups such as nations, ethnic groups, and religions. Recognizing the world with the eyes of a single identity of one certain group is a fundamental cause of conflict and violence, as can be seen through terrorism and war that arises from one religious standard that divides the world.There are three goals in the inquiry-based learning that explores the process of changing and shaping an individual's identity, beyond the development of group identity. First, students should be aware that individuals in a community have diversity, without thinking that people in the past had the same values ​​and mindset. It will help cultivate the citizenship in a pluralistic and democratic society. Next, students should be able to better understand the context and meaning of the macroscopic theme based on a detailed inquiry into the smaller subject of individuals. It will allow them to identify historical facts that are excluded or distorted from historically important themes due to the authority of “official history” and “simplification and reduction” of learning. The final goal of this learning is to let the students empathize with the individuals they meet in the learning and further acknowledge the dynamic relationship between individuals, groups, and structures. Consequently, students will realize that their lives and social changes are not irrelevant, which increases the likelihood of students' social involvement.Even if a particular social identity created by the group to which we belong promotes conflict and violence, it is difficult to completely eliminate them. However, we can mitigate the problem by recognizing and reinforcing “alternative identities” that compete with the problematic identities. In history education, it is necessary to strive to find and form an identity that plays a role of ‘bridge’ that connects them and us, not to emphasize the identity that distinguishes us from them. Through the process of exploring the diverse identities in the past, students can find themselves experiencing the connection with others. This effort will promote understanding of others as well as oneself, as opposed to attempting to narrow the identity, and will make the society a little more peaceful. In the case of the history of the Korean independence movement presented above as an example, it can be seen from the responses of the students that instead of highlighting the greatness of the independence activists, finding shared points between the activists and the students can rather encourage their contribution and engagement in a community."

The purpose of this study lies in examining aspects of his philosophy that are more clearly highlighted when viewed through a Neo-Confucian reading and reviewing his critical problematics. In my view, just as Ch'oe's thought clearly cannot be simply reduced to or converged into modern Western learning, it cannot possibly be understood in complete severance from the traditional learning of the Choson Dynasty, or Neo-Confucianism. This is because the establishment of universal learning encompassing both the East and the West, or the establishment of a new unified discipline connecting the learning and thought of the East and the West was the goal of Ch'oe's philosophy. Even if to use Western learning in a manner suited to the framework of his thought, Ch'oe inevitably would have had to presume intellectual discernment differing from that of the West. I reviewed the shared intellectual grammar premised by Ch'oe's thought and Neo-Confucianism with a focus on the following points of contention. First, by distinguishing between the positions of the active energy of all nature 運化氣(yunhuaqi)[天命之性] and the energy of individual physical forms 形質氣 (xingzhiqi)[氣質之性], he distinguished between the two levels of energy 氣(qi). Second, Ch'oe modified the theory of the whole being-function 體用 (tiyonglun) based on the traditional 理(li) 氣(qi) of Neo-Confucianism and reinterpreted it as the theory of whole being-function of the active energy of all nature 氣之體用. Third, he acknowledged the study of the transcendence which adopted the spiritual energy 神氣(shenqi) limited to individuals' physical forms 形質(xingzhi) and made it accord with the energy of all nature, and, furthermore, established accord between heaven and humans 天人一致 and the unity of all people 萬姓一體 as the goals of the theory of cultivation 修養. In addition, he presumed that changes in not only awareness but also the self [self-cultivation 修身] and others [observation of people 相人] were important effects of study by epistemic examination 推測(tuice). Such points of contention are issues that invariably must be scrutinized within their relationships to Neo-Confucianism, the traditional learning of Choson. Although Ch'oe stressed both Confucianism and its norms, he nevertheless did not establish rebuilding Confucianism during the latter half of the Choson Dynasty as the goal of his studies. Ch'oe aimed at a universal, unified discipline that would encompass the East and the West instead of creating or reinforcing a gradation or a hierarchy in the relationship between China and Korea or between the West and the East. Consequently, Ch'oe's philosophy inevitably distanced itself from not only Neo-Confucianism but also Western Learning 西學 and, conversely, was able to obtain valid intellectual cues as much from Neo-Confucianism, the country's traditional learning, as from Western Learning."

Nowadays it creates something new. Just a few years ago, artificial intelligence would not have thought of composing and drawing pictures by itself. Smart artificial intelligence produces works similar to human beings in the fields of  music and art, which were estimated as human’s creative area. Artificial intelligence even plays a role in the development of new drugs and computer programs. The paper starts from the question whether artificial intelligence should be regarded as a human tool or artifacts of artificial intelligence should be treated as protected inventions under the patent law.  Thus the paper focuses on the artifacts produced by artificial intelligence and how to protect them. Unlike the protection by copyright law, there would be considerable controversy about the claim that artifacts of artificial intelligence should be protected by patent law. Nevertheless the author intends to insist the necessity of protection because artificial intelligence may have meaningful legal impact. The pace of technological progress is much quicker than that had been in the past. However laws have a tendency of coping with the phenomenon slowly. The author wish to share results through the promotion of science and technology with my contemporaries.  The paper briefly reviewed technical features of artificial intelligence. In particular the author reviewed the operating principles of AlphaGo Zero, which can create a new way without human intervention through reinforcement learning. In the case of artificial intelligence, the creation of artworks without any human intervention is likely to correspond to the conceptual invention of Article 2 (1) of the patent law. Artificial intelligence can create new outcomes through self-learning, as seen in the use of artificial intelligence in the pharmaceutical industry and computer programs. There are two results that could be considered meaningful in the process of artificial intelligence. First, the ability of processing data in aspects of time and amount of data. It is superior than general computers due to self-learning. Second, some unpredicted unique results through its self-learning process. The first result may be difficult to be a meaningful invention under the patent law. However,  the second result may not be handled just as a tool. It is difficult to say that it is a natural phenomenon. If so, the result of artificial intelligence could be protected as inventions under the patent law. Considering the possibility of artificial intelligence technology being used in industries, the paper tried to think about how to look at artificial intelligence output.

심층학습을 이용한 대화시스템의 연구방법 분석,2018,"['Deep Neural Network', 'Task-oriented dialogue System', 'Deep Learning', 'Chit-chat Bot']",,"In this study, we discuss the basic technology of dialogue systems based on the deep neural network for natural language processing(NLP). Deep learning has become a basic technique in dialogue systems. Many researchers investigated on applying neural networks to the different components of a traditional task-oriented dialogue system, including natural language understanding, dialogue state tracking, and natural language generation, We study the recent technical advances on task-oriented dialogue systems and extent to the non-task-oriented system. We find that the end-to-end models are prevailing and representative in most of recent research papers. Also, it is blurring the boundaries between the task-oriented dialogue systems and non-task-oriented systems. In particular, the chit-chat dialogues of generative method are modeled by the end-to-end model directly. The task-oriented systems are also moving towards an end-to-end model with reinforcement learning. It is noting that current end-to-end models are still improving. We discuss some possible research directions and the technical challenges. In the future, we expect that accuracy of dialogue system will be improved further by employing reinforcement learning method."

Ultra-Reliable Communication in 5G mmWave Networks: A Risk-Sensitive Approach,2018,,,"<P>In this letter, we investigate the problem of providing gigabit wireless access with reliable communication in 5G millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output networks. In contrast to the classical network design based on average metrics, we propose a distributed risk-sensitive reinforcement learning-based framework to jointly optimize the beamwidth and transmit power, while taking into account the sensitivity of mmWave links due to blockage. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm achieves more than 9 Gbps of user throughput with a guaranteed probability of 90%, whereas the baselines guarantee less than 7.5 Gbps. More importantly, there exists a rate-reliability-network density tradeoff, in which as the user density increases from 16 to 96 per km<SUP>2</SUP>, the fraction of users that achieves 4 Gbps is reduced by 11.61% and 39.11% in the proposed and the baseline models, respectively.</P>"

By doing so, the present study attempts to provide implications and suggestions. First, in respect to educational changes in the curricula, it is interpreted that there have been significant improvements in Korean language education as public education. Secondly, it is also indicated that Korean language education has been reinforced. The current study interpreted that these changes have been made in an attempt to enhance foundation competence in order to minimize learning loss for school-age learners. Based on these evaluation, two suggestions are made: firstly, it is recommended that the categories of learners should be diversified. Both <2012 Korean Language Curriculum> and <2017 Korean Language Curriculum> encompass various learners of multicultural immigrants, international students, students from multicultural families, students from North Korean defector families, and students who have lived abroad. This study devises two categories: learners who have Korean language ability and learners who don’t have Korean language ability based on their Korean language competence. By inventing two different categories, it is possible to apply different learning and teaching method for different groups of learners. In addition, it is suggested that educational contents should be diversified according to the types of learners. Therefore, this study distinguishes contents focusing practical Korean from academic Korean. For practical Korean contents, they should be organized to enhance communicative competence for everyday life and learn classroom Korean expression. For academic Korean, it should be appropriate to organize educational contents which enhance fundamental learning competence, interpersonal competence, and community-identity competence of learners who have Korean language competence."

The result of this study shows that after-school English education is believed to be in urgent need of improving the quality of the programs in order to strengthen public performance and expertise in the program. First, it should be transformed into a way that the government should become an operating entity, develop and provide quality programs to schools from one in which individual schools operate programs themselves or on commission. Second, it should provide educational alternatives that allow students to learn more about participation and experience unlike traditional classes. In other words, it is necessary to supplement the limitations of regular classes by developing a model for English education based on Culports (Culture+Sports) combining play, culture and learning. Finally, in order to increase the professionalism and sustainability of teaching and programs, it is necessary to switch from temporary or non-regular-oriented teacher system to a regular teacher system dedicated to after-school education. This requires a mid- to long-term policy vision for after-school English education and a sophisticated implementation plan to implement it. The current study argues that the publicity of after-school English education should be reinforced in the way it absorbs private needs for English education."
Hierarchical Cloud Computing Architecture for Context-Aware IoT Services,2018,,,"<P>This paper presents a new cloud computing model for context-aware Internet of Things services. The proposed computing model is hierarchically composed of two layers: a cloud control layer (CCL) and a user control layer (UCL). The CCL manages cloud resource allocation, service scheduling, service profile, and service adaptation policy from a system performance point of view. Meanwhile, the UCL manages end-to-end service connection and service context from a user performance point of view. The proposed model can support nonuniform service binding and its real-time adaptation using meta-objects. Furthermore, it supports intelligent service-context management using a supervised and reinforcement learning-based machine learning framework. We implemented a lightweight prototype of the proposed computing model. Evaluations confirm that the proposed computing model offers enhanced performance compared with legacy uniform computing models.</P>"

In this reason, this study aims to provide a model of content-centered writing education using visual materials in writing education for foreign students. And I applied it to the class in S university and see if the model is efficient. Two discussion tasks were included in presenting the teaching - learning model. First, this study suggests how to activate the learner's schema using visual data instead of teacher’s direct suggestion about target knowledge in the second stage of the fourth stage of the lesson. Second, this study reinforces ‘confirmation stage’through rewriting instead of granting the exercise assignment in order for the learner’s scheme to be extended into writing knowledge. After this, this model induced the learner to select the extended writing knowledge strategically to derive the result in the task execution stage. A case study was conducted for freshmen students of S university’s foreign students in order to discuss the effects of learning. As a result, it has been verified that the activation of the schema using the visual data helps the learner to expand the knowledge of writing. In addition, it was confirmed that the learner can strategically select and apply writing knowledge to actively derive his writing results through the learning model presented here."
QoE 향상을 위한 Deep Q-Network 기반의 지능형 비디오 스트리밍 메커니즘,2018,"['Adaptive Video Streaming', 'DASH', 'Deep Q-Network', 'Quality of Experience(QoE)']",,"With recent development of high-speed wide-area wireless networks and wide spread of high- performance wireless devices, the demand on seamless video streaming services in Long Term Evolution (LTE) network environments is ever increasing. To meet the demand and provide enhanced Quality of Experience (QoE) with mobile users, the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) has been actively studied to achieve QoE enhanced video streaming service in dynamic network environments. However, the existing DASH algorithm to select the quality of requesting video segments is based on a procedural algorithm so that it reveals a limitation to adapt its performance to dynamic network situations. To overcome this limitation this paper proposes a novel quality selection mechanism based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN) model, the DQN-based DASH ABR(DQNABR) mechanism. The DQNABR mechanism replaces the existing DASH ABR algorithm with an intelligent deep learning model which optimizes service quality to mobile users through reinforcement learning. Compared to the existing approaches, the experimental analysis shows that the proposed solution outperforms in terms of adapting to dynamic wireless network situations and improving QoE experience of end users."

Recently, a deep Q-network (DQN), which is a combination of deep learning and Q-learning theory, has attracted attention as a reinforcement learning algorithm. It is used to train the robot to recognize obstacles and avoid collisions while it is moving toward a designated destination. However, the existing DQN method can handle only discrete tasks and low-dimensional spaces, meaning it is not suitable for continuous, especially the control of mobile robots. In addition, the existing LiDAR sensor method uses distance as the input for learning, with the system determining the next action based only on the distance from the mobile robot to the obstacle. In this process, due to the frequent fluctuation in the action values, unnatural acceleration/deceleration actions are required, which leads to physical shocks to the robot and low driving power efficiency. In this paper, this problem is solved by applying a replay buffer to store the output of the network. That is, the action values are stored in the memory and fed back as input again following the action order of the network. Experiments are carried out on an actual robot after reinforcement learning in ROS-GAZEBO simulations and the validity of the algorithm is verified through an analysis of the experimental data."

The developed module has an independent configuration for application in various driving environments and is based on a platform for organically operating them. Each module is studied for decision making on lane changes and for securing safety through reinforcement learning using a deep learning technique. The autonomous mobile moving body operating to change the driving state has a characteristic where the next operation of the mobile body can be determined only if the definition of the speed determination model (according to its functions) and the lane change decision are correctly preceded. Also, if all the moving bodies traveling on a general road are equipped with an autonomous driving function, it is difficult to consider the factors that may occur between each mobile unit from unexpected environmental changes. Considering these factors, we applied the decision model to the platform and studied the lane change decision system for implementation of the platform. We studied the decision model using a modular learning method to reduce system complexity, to reduce the learning time, and to consider model replacement."

The existing reinforcement learning algorithm is a model-free method that focuses on maximizing the expectation of the reward, and the adaptation speed is slow because it empirically learns the uncertainty of the environment. In contrast, the model-based method that learns the environmental model can adapt quickly to changes in the environment by applying the simulation results to the expectation reward. In this paper, we propose a model-based reinforcement learning method that finds a strategy that maximizes the expectation of reward based on the on-line learning of the probability transition model of the environment, simulates the scenario probabilistically using the learned model. We implemented the dynamic environment containing uncertainty using FrozenLake simulator of OpenAI and compared the performance of the proposed model with the existing method in various aspects. The proposed model provides a framework for strategy exploration even in extreme situations where both uncertainty of state transition and instability of environmental change exist."

We conducted a systematic literature review to search for academic papers published in recent five years (from 2013 to 2017) in the major databases. Forty papers were coded and analyzed by the established coding framework in four dimensions: (a) basic publication information, (b) learning context, (c) learning mechanism, and (d) learning benefits. Overall, the results show that tangible technology has been used more for young learners in the kindergarten and primary school contexts mainly for science learning, to achieve both cognitive and affective learning outcomes, by coupling tangible objects with tabletops and desktop computers. From the synthesis of the review findings, this study suggests that the affordances of tangible technology useful for learning include embodied interaction, physical manipulations, and the physical-digital representational mapping. With such technical affordances, tangible technologies have the great potential in three particular areas in education: (a) learning spatial relationships, (b) making the invisible visible, and (c) reinforcing abstract concepts through the correspondence of representations. In conclusion, we suggest some areas for future research endeavors."

After two preliminary surveys for ensuring the reliability and validity of the measurement tools, a two-part survey was conducted on employees in various industries to collect the data for analysis, which was performed using PROCESS macro(Hayes, 2013). The common method bias was minimized by placing a time interval before measuring the dependent variables. Also, the job rank, duration of employment, job type, duration of work under the supervisor, and team size were used as control variables.The direct effect between issue leadership and grit was confirmed, and issue leadership was also found to increase the grit of subordinates indirectly by strengthening self-efficacy and through reducing learned helplessness. Furthermore, it was verified that issue leadership significantly affected subordinates’ grit through the serial multiple mediation via self-efficacy and learned helplessness. In other words, this study confirmed that issue leadership reinforces the self-efficacy of subordinates, which mitigates their learned helplessness to lead to a positive effect on their grit.

Recently, teaching methods including AL, PBL, FL have been applied to the class to improve the quality of university education and their effectiveness have been verified and the teaching design strategies have been studied. However, since education can be changed from the understanding of the internal experience and the reflective reflection of an instructor who is the subject of education, it is necessary to understand the instructor s experience of implementing a curriculum and change of class as well as these studies. From this perspective, using the narrative inquiry method, the researcher is to understand the experiences of the newly appointed professor participating in the iClass lecture development program of Jeonju University who used the Flipped learning method to implement the curriculum. Based on the classcase of the newly appointed professor, the researcher collected field texts by conducting in-depth interviews and contents analysis and compiled several fragmentary stories and reconstructed them into stories that would allow the reader to imagine other possibilities. The main implications are as follows: The instructor can reinforce contentexpertise through the Flipped learning teaching method, which includes the development of pre-contents and effectively operate the learner-centered education by analyzing and appropriating vast knowledge."

For this, a machine learning approach called an Adaptive Support Vector Machine (ASVM) together with the limit equilibrium method were introduced to minimize the iteration numbers during the classification training of the tunnel stability. The proposed method was compared with the results of typical Monte Carlo simulations. It was concluded that the ASVM was very efficient and accurate to calculate the probability of failure having auxiliary umbrella arches and uncertain material properties of the tunnel.

First, the applications of BSC to the social welfare organizations show the potentials as the systems of performance management and strategic organizational administration.Second, the applications of BSC are expected to contribute to the evolution of the social welfare organizations into learning organizations.Third, BSC can be used as the effective communication vehicles among the inside of the organizations enabling appropriate monitoring and directions toward the specific activity goals under the common understanding of the objective of the organizations. Forth, the practice of BSC as a means of performance management facilitates active involvement in the communication and information sharing with resource providers.The suggestions based on the results of this study are like this. First, according to Kaplan and Norton, ‘the failures of the strategy occur in the process of performances rather than the stage of the establishment.’ The management of performance in BSC should be implemented through clarification of the organizational visions and strategies, and the balance of the ordinary tasks and the goals of the strategies. The importance of monitoring should not be neglected in that constant accomplishment of the performance is followed by monitoring the consistency in the process of goal achievement of individuals and the organization, the revision of the problems, decision making through the participation and teamwork. Second, the necessity of developing systems to reinforce the workers’ abilities and the learning organizations remains when managing the social welfare organizations with stable strategies. The administration of the organizations of social welfare depends on the abilities of the workers. Human resource development is the key factor of the satisfaction of the consumers and the contribution to the local communities. In that way, the social welfare organizations need to make all the workers recognize the facts that the stabilization of the management is accomplished by the results of the efforts to reach the direction points of the whole organization with the all members’ responsibilities and the visions for the future. An essential condition to cope with the dramatic change of the outside circumstances is the development of the learning culture of the organizations and the maintenance of the systems to consolidate individual capabilities. Third, in the aspect of the fact that the strategic management system of BSC is the administrative means to achieve the improvement of organizational assignments and promote the performances, the attention and support of the management is crucial. As this study shows, the crucial factors of the successful performance of BSC are the organizations and personnel taking full responsibilities of BSC, the development of expertise, and active participations with organizational support of the management"

The class was operated by adopting the method of co-teaching lecturing, where two lecturers, one majoring in humanities and the other majoring in musical education, jointly developed and designed the course curriculum and led the class by converging and integrating the lesson contents into one lesson. As a result, students could approach the two fields of music and humanities through balanced fusion lesson contents. This was a departure from the traditional teaching method for liberal arts classes, where one lecturer focuses on one field of study, and, consequently, the two lecturers could broaden their understanding of other academic areas and widen the scope of their research viewpoints. In addition, they were able to pioneer a new method for academic research by introducing other fields or majors into their own research area. Consequently, this study is expected to lay the foundation upon which liberal arts courses at universities can contribute toward cultivating creative talents in the future and aims to serve as a starting point for the development of fusion liberal arts education."

Therefore, there are a number of visits to the safety experience center as a family unit. Inaddition, safety education is being promoted through the curriculum of civic education and schoolusing experiences of safety accidents centering on the government.However, the supply rate is only 50.37% compared to the actual facility size required, and thepenetration rate differs for each municipality. In addition, the experience of safety is low,because the level of danger is warned and the code of conduct in case of a disaster is received.Therefore, this study intends to derive the design factor of the safety experience museum whichcan increase the efficiency of experience by reinforcing the reality and the immersion even if it isused during the short experience time in the limited facilities. In addition, we proposed a designmethod of safety experience facility that could reinforce reality and immersion by applying mixedreality combining storytelling and virtual reality and augmented reality technology.The results of this study are as follows: 1) To apply storytelling to the safety experienceexhibition, it is necessary to design the story by dividing into first, second, and third person. Inthe case of the first person, the victim 's gaze, in case of the second person, the gaze of aninjurious factor, and the last third person could include storytelling in order to give insight intothe whole situation at the global point of view. And 2) to add a discussion process to learn eachplot of the story so that students can share their insights once again. Finally, 3) Mixed reality isapplied to increase the sense of realism and immersion, and designed to cope with the crisis byexercising safety sense in a disaster situation."

To overcome the disadvantages of general learning problems, the proposed model uses a combination of features of EBP and OVSSA. In other words, the proposed method can construct a single model by taking advantage of each algorithm so that it can escape to the probability theory of OVSSA in order to reinforce the property that EBP falls into local minimum value. In the proposed algorithm, methods for reducing errors in EBP are used as energy functions and the energy is minimized to OVSSA. A simple experimental result confirms that two algorithms with different properties can be combined."

This study was conducted to investigate whether a clinical practice examination (CPX) preparation program improves students’ CPX score in terms of case specificity.Methods: One hundred and thirteen senior students in a medical school participated in this study. During the fourth-year clerkship, 28 students (24.8%) from three rotation groups took a 3-day CPX preparation course consist-ing of module development, role play, and comprehensive physical exam skills training. Eleven rotation groups (n=85) were compared as control. Both the intervention and control group took two comprehensive CPXs before and after the clerkship was completed.Results: There was no significant difference in age, sex, and school type between the two groups. On pre-test CPX, there was no significant difference in total and sectional scores between the two groups. On post-test CPX, total scores of the intervention group were higher than those of the control groups (69.5±4.3 vs. 67.5±4.4, P<0.05). History taking scores were higher in intervention groups (70.0±6.0 vs. 66.0±6.6, P=0.01). The station scores of vaginal dis-charge with case similarity were higher in the intervention groups (73.0±6.3 vs. 68.9±9.3, P=0.03).Conclusion: A short CPX preparation course improved history taking ability, but its effect was greater only in a spe-cific case, similar to the pre-course case. Whether this effect was due to the test experience or true improvement in competency requires further investigation."

The significance of their presence in Chosŏn, however, waned with the weakening of this ideology and the rise of Northern Learning in the nineteenth century. Under these adverse circumstances, the Ming loyalist families in the early nineteenth century employed various strategies to re-emphasize Ming loyalism and consolidate their Ming loyalist identity; an initiative they viewed as critical in justifying their presence in Chosŏn society. This article traces the variety of these identity-reinforcing efforts by the Ming loyalist families, ranging from shrine-building and compilation efforts to intermarriage. It focuses on the ritual structures built in Chojong’am by these descendants and analyzes how the symbols of Ming loyalism embedded in this place by the Chosŏn literati in the seventeenth century were manipulated by Ming descendants in the early nineteenth century. Through these initiatives, the descendants asserted a new version of Ming loyalism that not only potentially undermined the claims of the Chosŏn court/literati to be the inheritors of Ming culture but strengthened the symbolic significance of the Ming loyalist families. This study illuminates this implicit tension and disjuncture between the positions of the two parties, which is significant for understanding developments, rather than seeing the Ming loyalists’ activities as an outcome of ongoing cooperative interactions between the Chosŏn court and the Ming families nourished during the eighteenth century."

Liberal arts education in universities is necessary as it develops students’ competence. A writing course should allow students to improve the thinking skills, problem-solving skills, and expressive skills for problem-solving through the writing process, and ultimately reinforce their communicative competence. In particular, if writing is a method of communication, it is important to understand the contents in their context, and describe exactly what they are based on. Daechaekmun is an appropriate text for such needs. Careful reading and analysis should be carried out in advance, and answers should be given in accordance to the intention of the question. Therefore, the reading and writing strategies of Daechaekmun are suitable for the interconnecting class between reading and writing.  Daechaekmun should understand the exam writers’ intentions and give answers to those in need of them. A writing strategy for Daechaekmun is as follows: setting the proper status of Chaekmunja as a reader and Daechaekja as a writer, writing in deductive reasoning and first-to-end connecting (having a theme repeated at the beginning and ending) styles, building a main idea through constructive responses, answering to each question, inferring through a metaphor, and following the conventions of writing genres.  These strategies are applied to the reading and writing steps. The reading step includes reading Chaekmun and Daechaeck, and inferring the intention of the questions and answers demanded by the exam writers. The writing step applied to the real class consists of identifying the given questions-the question intention, proposing the corresponding content, and selecting the strategies matched with the exam writer’s intention. By engaging in these multiple steps, students have the opportunity to improve their own writing strategies for future logical and persuasive writing after they have learnt the writing strategy of Daechaekmun."

Furthermore, after considering condition, utilization, strategy of making use of languages, this study mainly focuses on foreign language education as well as Japanese education in Korea.The ultimate purpose of this study is to make sure introducing “CAN-DO” into actual education based on quality evaluation. However, such assessment has not been systematically and generally introduced in the field of education. On the other hand, Japan has struggled to develop 『JF-STANDARD』 for Japanese education, learning, evaluation, provided by The Japan Foundation. It leads to widespread use of Japanese internationally and forges framework for competence of Japanese. Such desirable language education not only reinforces education through distinctive characteristics, but also becomes effective education activity of communication as regards global language learners."

1920∼1930년대 식민지 조선의 여성 개념과 젠더 — 부정적 기표 ‘계집’과 구여성을 중심으로 —,2018,"['여성', '여성 혐오', '비하어', '계집', '구여성', 'women', 'misogyny', 'insulting terms', 'gyejib', 'old-fashioned woman']","본고는 근대한국의 여성 개념을 분석하려는 작업의 일환으로, 20세기 전반에 간행된 주요 잡지들에서 ‘계집’과 구여성이라는 부정적 기표가 사용된 양상을 분석하였다. 그를 통해 1920년대 후반부터 1930년대 초반에 걸쳐 여성 담론이 폭발하면서 긍정적인 것뿐 아니라 부정적인 여성 기표도 함께 증가한 배경에는 젠더관계의 재편이 있었음을 확인하였다. 가장 중요한 변화는 여성들이 공적 영역에등장했을 뿐 아니라 남성의 지배로부터도 해방되어 대등한 사람으로서 관계 맺기를 주장했다는 점이다. 지식인 남성들은 여성들도 민족 또는 계급해방운동에동참하기를 기대하면서 신여성의 등장을 환영했지만, 다른 한편으로는 사적 관계에서 자신이 이러한 새로운 여성들과 어떻게 관계를 맺어야 할 것인가 하는문제에 봉착했다. 이때 식민지 조선의 남성 대부분이 새로운 이상적 가정을 뒷받침할 수 있는 경제력이 없었다는 사실이 논의를 극단적으로 몰고 갔다. 성적 대상으로 치부된 ‘젊은’ 여성들은 남성을 유혹해서 타락시키는 존재이면서, 동시에남성들이 소유하고자 욕망하는 대상이 되었다. 또한 ‘배운’ 여성들은 연애결혼의상대로 설정되었지만, 남편에게 순종하지 않고 가난한 살림살이를 꾸려 내지 못하는 경우에는 조선의 현실에 맞지 않게 건방지고 사치를 부린다고 비난당했다.이 과정에서 젊은 여성을 가리키던 ‘계집’은 성적 대상을 비하하는 어휘로 전환되었고, 구여성은 신여성을 남성에게 순응하는 배우자이도록 제한하려는 의도에서만 긍정적으로 묘사되었다. 1930년대 후반 ‘계집’이 유흥업 종사자뿐 아니라 남편의 소유물이라는 의미에서 아내를 가리키게 된 현상은 가정 안팎에서 모두 남녀 관계를 성적으로 인식하게 되었다는 것, 그리고 가정 내에서는 아내가 남편과대등하기를 바라던 신여성들의 기획이 실패했다는 것을 의미한다. 이상과 같이근대 이후 남성 개념보다는 여성 개념이 논쟁의 중심에 서면서 시대 변화와 함께두드러지게 변화되었다","As part of the work to analyze the concept of women in Colonial Korea, this paper investigates the usage of negative signifiers such as gyejib (bitch) and ‘old-fashioned woman’ in major magazines published during the first half of the 20th century, confirming that there was a reorganization of gender relations between the late 1920s and early 1930s. The most important change is that women not only appeared in the public sphere, but also claimed equality with men. In the public sphere, male intellectuals welcomed the emergence of this female role, seeing women as potential allies in the national or class liberation movements, but they also faced a serious challenge in deciding how to engage with these new women in their personal relationships. At the time, most of the men of colonial Korea lacked the economic power to support the new ideal family, which drove the discussion to extremes. ‘Young’ women were regarded as sexual objects and targets for men to possess, but this also created a representation of fallen women who corrupt men. In contrast, ‘learned’ women were seen in the context of a loving marriage, but were condemned as impertinent if they did not obey their husbands and as extravagant if they could not manage their household. In this period, the meaning of gyejib, which referred to a young woman, was narrowed to become an object of sexual desire, and the meaning of ‘old-fashioned woman’ had a positive connotation only when it was used to make new women accept the role of compliant spouse. During the late 1930s, gyejib came to mean a wife as a chattel possessed by her husband, demonstrating the failure of the new woman’s aspiration to be her husband’s equal. There were significant changes to the concept of women, as compared with the concept of men, reinforcing the usefulness of a ‘special’ as opposed to a ‘universal’ focus in the study of conceptual history."

In addition, Native Languages Education is expected to make the Taiwanese society more competitive as they will serve as human resources there in the future (Taiwanese Ministry of Education, 2009). Furthermore, the third Native Languages Education by which multicultural students can choose their parents’ native language as the second language in public education will start in 2019.

Tool integration refers to the integration of the language skills learned in the language arts subjects into the means of learning in the contents subjects. As a results, the integration between the elementary Korean language and Science textbooks was generally good. A few policy were suggest. Developing the general curriculum in the future, the requirements for integration between the subjects is needed. Korean language arts should reinforce the multi-modal literacy required by science textbooks. In science textbooks, it is necessary to differentiate between the talking and discussion discourse. There is a need to reinvestigate 'talking' as a basic learning skills. 'Science writing' which regularly appears in science textbooks is a good writing environment that can enhance the authenticity of writing."

Structuring of data library is made by selecting 4 types of crops in the subject area to structure the orthophotograph as the base data for crop reading in accordance with the growth period and flight height. As a result of the visual reading by using the pattern of photo imaging for each elevation, the initial crop reading following the elevation and growth period had low recognition rate, but it gets heightened as it approaches to mid to later time of growth. In addition, the case of crop cultivation area of 1,000㎡ or more and the learning effect by pattern analysis have worked as an important factor in the increase of recognition rate. The result of this study is considered to be facilitated in the agriculture and statistics fields for the growth of crop and field survey works, and there is a need to reinforce the study on pattern recognition to overcome the limitation of visual reading structuring of various libraries for enhancing the crop recognition rate."

They have developed the idea of ‘small-Sinocentrism(小中華)’ which means that Chosun dynasty can be a country of small-Sinocentrism succeeding to Ming dynasty as long as they inherit and practice the traditions of Han Chinese(漢族) and reinforced existing Han Chinese-centered Sinocentrism for about 150 years. In this social atmosphere, Hong Dae-yong’s travelogs introduced the information about the reality of international situation related to the Han Chinese people’s point of view on international society and the advancement of Qing dynasty compared to the backwardness of Chosun.  Basically, Han Chinese people evaluated Qing dynasty, governed by Manchurian, not based on their ethnic group but on practical point of view such as political stability and people’s quality of life. They had the practical point of view about the Chinese queue(辮髮) and Manchurian costume which regarded as symbols of barbaric practice for Chosun people. And Han Chinese people presented embarrassed look with Hong Dae-yong’s speeches and behaviors based on Han Chinese-centered Sinocentrism.  Meanwhile, while he kept belittling Manchurian as a barbarian and highly appreciating Chosun as a country of small-Sinocentrism, Hong Dae-yong realized and admitted the fact that Qing was highly advanced country compared to Chosun in various ways from culture, technology, academic diversity and people’s character. Especially, Hong Dae-yong’s criticism on Chosun’s academic practices, scholars’ closed attitude focusing only on Confucianism and Chinese documents, connoted criticism on small-Sinocentrism.  Hong Dae-yong’s travelogs ended showing two contradictory point of view on Qing and Chosun society, but his records influenced the development of the idea of “the thoughts for learning Qing culture(北學)” which admitted virtues of Qing society and argued that Chosun should try to learn and introduce Qing ’s culture."

Secondly, the contents and the tendencies found in precedent Tasan studies that have been dealing with the above-mentioned concept at home and abroad are outlined. Thirdly, based on above discussions, the main points of issue that have been raised in preceding Tasan studies around the above-mentioned concept and this writer’s opinions about these main points of issue are presented in turn.In conclusion, this writer’s stands about the main points of issue that have been raised in precedent Tasan studies around the above-mentioned concept are as follows. Firstly, concerning ‘the origin’ of Jeong Yak-yong’s concept of ‘Sang-je’, ① the influences of Catholicism that are represented by Cheon-ju Sil-eu(『天主實義』, Tian-zhu Shi-yi, The True Meaning of the Lord of Heaven) which had claimed to stand for the accommodationist explanations of Confucianism ⓐ served in reality as a major momentum that reconfirmed and reinforced Jeong Yak-yong’s critical mind about the then current learning and his confident belief in his early scholarship held on since 21 years old and made him capable of finding some new expressions to embody it, ⓑ above all, gave him an objective eye enable to take a survey of the whole Confucian traditions in which he himself had been included and via this provided him some insights and clues to dig out and reinterpret the Confucian traditions. ② In view of these facts, a standpoint that denies Catholic influences on Jeong Yak-yong’s concept of ‘Sang-je’ entirely, not to mention a standpoint that overemphasizes Catholic influences on that exclusively, is not to the point.Secondly, regarding ‘the meaning’ of Jeong Yak-yong’s term of ‘Jo-hwa(造化, Zao-hua, the creation and the operation of the universe)’ that was recognized as one of Sang-je’s powers, ① Jeong Yak-yong used this term in a broad sense, namely, as a term that included not only the meaning of ‘the operation of the universe’ that implied the meanings of ‘the exercise of authority over heaven, earth and all things, the control and the management over them, the growth of them’ at the same time, but also the meaning of ‘the creation of them’. ② In this context, some studies which maintained that Sang-je is ‘the ruler of the cosmos, not its creator’ or it means only ‘the Mother Nature’s principle of producing and extinguishing all things’ may have room for reconsideration.Thirdly, referring to ‘the meaning’ of Jeong Yak-yong’s term of ‘Jae-je(宰制, zai-zhi, the control and the management of the universe)’ that was also recognized as one of Sang-je’s powers, especially a question of ‘ Does Jae-je involve the meaning of revelation?’, ① Jeong Yak-yong answered this question that Sang-je reveals its own order, that is, Cheon-myeong(天命, Tian-ming, Heaven’s decree) through ‘Do-sim(道心, Dao-xin, mind of the Way)’ and ‘divination by Ju-yeok(『周易』, Zhou-yi or Yi-jing, Book of Changes)’ to human beings continually. ② In this sense, among the existing Tasan studies, some arguments that appraise and recognize Jeong Yak-yong’s Sang-je merely as ‘a moral force’, ‘a dumb existence without revelation’, ‘a deistic supervisor’ or ‘an impersonal and an abstract existence’ may be problematic.Lastly, respecting ‘the conceptual position’ of Jeong Yak-yong’s concept of ‘Sang-je’ occupying in his philosophical world view and his learning system, ① Jeong Yak-yong’s ‘Sang-je’ can be seen at least as a core and an indispensable ca..."
고도화되어 가는 북한의 위협에 대응하여 한국은 무엇을 해야 하는가?,2018,"['North Korean Threats', 'Pakistan', 'Nuclear Weapon', 'Korean Peninsula', 'Military Provocation', 'Cold War', '북한 위협', '파키스탄', '핵무기', '한반도', '군사 도발', '냉전']","현재 북한은 핵전력을 고도화하고 있다. 향후 북한은 고도화된 핵전력에 기반하여 현상타파를 시도할 것이다. 하지만 파키스탄의 사례에서 나타나듯이, 북한의 국지도발과 위기조성 전략은 한국으로는 쉽게 억지할 수 없다. 인도는 군사력과 경제력에서 파키스탄을 압도하며 독자적인 핵전력을 가지고 있지만, 파키스탄의 도발 자체를 완벽하게 억지하지 못하였다. 안정-불안정 역설이 등장하면서, 한반도에서는 전략적 차원에서 대규모 전쟁 가능성은 줄어들지만 이러한 전략적 안정성에 기초하여 전술적 차원에서 국지도발 및 소규모 위기 가능성은 증가할 것이다. 그리고 북한은 이러한 안정-불안정 역설을 이용하여 자신의 요구조건을 관철하려고 할 것이다. 때문에 한국은 세 가지 측면에서 대비해야 한다. 첫째, 북한을 응징하기 보다는 위기 안정성을 유지하는 것이 중요하다. 둘째, 위기 안정성을 유지하면서 중간 정도의 수준에서 북한을 압박하는 것이 필요하다. 셋째, 민주주의 체제에 대한 신념을 가지고 냉전 기간 소련에 대응하였던 미국의 경험과 지난 20년 동안 파키스탄의 도발을 통제하고 있는 인도의 경험에서 교훈을 찾아야 한다.","North Korea's nuclear arsenal is growing and a classic Cold War dynamics is emerging. A full-scale war is highly improbable, but a series of local crises highly likely. For decades, South Asia has observed a series of Pakistan's provocations against India, despite New Delhi's material superiority and independent nuclear forces. A stability-instability paradox will enable North Korea to enjoy the nuclear shield and to challenge the status-quo in the Korean Peninsula. Under the circumstances, South Korea should (1) maintain crisis stability (2) challenge North Korea with medium level of risk and (3) learn the lessons from the Cold War America and the contemporary India."
