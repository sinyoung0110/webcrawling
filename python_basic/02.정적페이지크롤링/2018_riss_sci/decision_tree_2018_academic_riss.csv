To make the R&D game model practically, we consider a strategic decision making process for competing firms in R&D investment markets where one is with a relatively higher brand image or cost functions and the other with low investment cost through non-infringing imitation. The scenarios take into account the effect of the presence and absence of patent protection on the firms’ strategic decisions that cause change in the competition, uncertain patent acquisition and the two firms’ cooperation & licensing options. Through the decision-making tree analysis, this research analyzes factors influencing decisions on R&D investment of two competing companies, draws expected profits and R&D incentives along decision-making paths. Especially, through DT analysis using not only payoff but strategic and non-strategic R&D incentives, we structure various variables included in the asymmetric R&D investment game model, and compare decision-making process based on expected values of decision-making nodes and changes of R&D incentives. Our findings are as follows: (1) The best strategy in an asymmetric competition situation analyzed through Decision-Tree using payoffs and R&D incentives for both companies is to compete through R&D investment and technology licensing decision. (2) The second-best strategy is to choose no-R&D decision for the superior Firm 1, and R&D cooperation for inferior Firm 2. (3) DT using R&D incentive enables us to analyze the best and the second-best strategies of firms with half times as many as the number of DT needed in using payoff, enhancing computational efficiency."
Evaluating Pedicle-Screw Instrumentation Using Decision-Tree Analysis Based on Pullout Strength,2018,"['Pedicle screws', 'Pullout strength', 'Osteoporosis', 'Machine learning', 'Decision-support']",,"Study Design: A biomechanical study of pedicle-screw pullout strength.Purpose: To develop a decision tree based on pullout strength for evaluating pedicle-screw instrumentation.Overview of Literature: Clinically, a surgeon’s understanding of the holding power of a pedicle screw is based on perioperative intuition (which is like insertion torque) while inserting the screw. This is a subjective feeling that depends on the skill and experience of the surgeon. With the advent of robotic surgery, there is an urgent need for the creation of a patient-specific surgical planning system.A learning-based predictive model is needed to understand the sensitivity of pedicle-screw holding power to various factors.Methods: Pullout studies were carried out on rigid polyurethane foam, representing extremely osteoporotic to normal bone for different insertion depths and angles of a pedicle screw. The results of these experimental studies were used to build a pullout-strength predictor and a decision tree using a machine-learning approach.Results: Based on analysis of variance, it was found that all the factors under study had a significant effect (p <0.05) on the holding power of a pedicle screw. Of the various machine-learning techniques, the random forest regression model performed well in predicting the pullout strength and in creating a decision tree. Performance was evaluated, and a correlation coefficient of 0.99 was obtained between the observed and predicted values. The mean and standard deviation of the normalized predicted pullout strength for the confirmation experiment using the current model was 1.01±0.04.Conclusions: The random forest regression model was used to build a pullout-strength predictor and decision tree. The model was able to predict the holding power of a pedicle screw for any combination of density, insertion depth, and insertion angle for the chosen range. The decision-tree model can be applied in patient-specific surgical planning and a decision-support system for spine-fusion surgery."

Prognostic Factors and Decision Tree for Long-Term Survival in Metastatic Uveal Melanoma,2018,"['Uveal melanoma', 'Neoplasm metastasis', 'Long-term survivors', 'Decision trees']",,"Purpose The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the existence of a bimodal survival pattern in metastatic uveal melanoma. Secondary aims were to identify the characteristics and prognostic factors associated with long-term survival and to develop a clinical decision tree.Materials and Methods The medical records of 99 metastatic uveal melanoma patients were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were classified as either short ( 12 months) or long-term survivors (> 12 months) based on a graphical interpretation of the survival curve after diagnosis of the first metastatic lesion. Ophthalmic and oncological characteristics were assessed in both groups.Results Of the 99 patients, 62 (62.6%) were classified as short-term survivors, and 37 (37.4%) as long-term survivors. The multivariate analysis identified the following predictors of long-term survival: age  65 years (p=0.012) and unaltered serum lactate dehydrogenase levels (p=0.018); additionally, the size (smaller vs. larger) of the largest liver metastasis showed a trend towards significance (p=0.063). Based on the variables significantly associated with long-term survival, we developed a decision tree to facilitate clinical decision-making.Conclusion The findings of this study demonstrate the existence of a bimodal survival pattern in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma. The presence of certain clinical characteristics at diagnosis of distant disease is associated with long-term survival. A decision tree was developed to facilitate clinical decision-making and to counsel patients about the expected course of disease."

Predictors of intentional intoxication using decision tree modeling analysis: a retrospective study,2018,"['Decision support techniques', 'Intoxication', 'Suicide']",,"Objective The suicide rate in South Korea is very high and is expected to increase in coming years. Intoxication is the most common suicide attempt method as well as one of the common reason for presenting to an emergency medical center. We used decision tree modeling analysis to identify predictors of risk for suicide by intentional intoxication. Methods A single-center, retrospective study was conducted at our hospital using a 4-year registry of the institute from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016. Demographic factors, such as sex, age, intentionality, therapeutic adherence, alcohol consumption, smoking status, physical disease, cancer, psychiatric disease, and toxicological factors, such as type of intoxicant and poisoning severity score were collected. Candidate risk factors based on the decision tree were used to select variables for multiple logistic regression analysis. Results In total, 4,023 patients with intoxication were enrolled as study participants, with 2,247 (55.9%) identified as cases of intentional intoxication. Reported annual percentages of intentional intoxication among patients were 628/937 (67.0%), 608/1,082 (56.2%), 536/1,017 (52.7), 475/987 (48.1%) from 2013 to 2016. Significant predictors identified based on decision tree analysis were alcohol consumption, old age, psychiatric disease, smoking, and male sex; those identified based on multiple regression analysis were alcohol consumption, smoking, male sex, psychiatric disease, old age, poor therapeutic adherence, and physical disease. Conclusion We identified important predictors of suicide risk by intentional intoxication. A specific and realistic approach to analysis using the decision tree modeling technique is an effective method to determine those groups at risk of suicide by intentional intoxication."
Analysis of Klebsiella as a Prognostic Factor of Ocular Outcomes in Endogenous Endophthalmitis with Decision Tree Analysis,2018,"['Endogenous', 'Endophthalmitis', 'Klebsiella pneumoniae', 'Ocular outcome']",,"Background: Endogenous endophthalmitis (EE) is a fulminant ocular disease. This study was conducted to explore frequent pathogens and significant prognostic factors associated with poor ocular outcomes.Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed in a tertiary hospital in Korea. Thirty-nine patients, treated between January 2000 and June 2017, were eligible for the analysis. Ocular outcomes were classified as follows: 1) no light perception (NLP), 2) light perception (LP), 3) hand motion (HM), 4) counting fingers (CF), and 5) 20/200 or better. Logistic regression and decision tree analyses were used to identify risk factors that were associated with poor outcomes.Results: Pathogens were identified in 23 (58.9%) samples from blood, liver aspirate, and/or vitreous humor. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent organism (12/39, 30.8%), followed by Candida species (3/39, 8.3%). The most common combined infection was liver abscess (16/39, 41.0%). Acute pyelonephritis occurred in 30.8% of cases (12/39). Final ocular outcomes were as follows: 35.9% (14/39) NLP, 15.4% (6/39) LP, 15.4% (6/39) HM, 7.7% (3/39) CF, and 25.6% (10/39) 20/200 or better. K. pneumoniae was a poor prognostic factor in univariate (odds ratio [OR], 13.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1-130.9) and multivariate (OR, 17.5; 95% CI, 2.1-398.8) regression analyses (NLP and LP vs. HM, CF, and 20/200 or better). Other factors did not reach statistical difference. Decision tree analysis identified K. pneumoniae as a node that divided ocular outcomes (P = 0.017).Conclusions: In conclusion, K. pneumoniae is the most frequent causative pathogen of EE. Considering the poor prognosis and rapid progression of K. pneumoniae EE, physicians should test for K. pneumoniae EE in patients who experience acute systemic infections with ocular signs and symptoms."
Using multi-source data and decision tree classification in mapping vegetation diversity,2018,"['Classifier', 'Land cover', 'Optical indices', 'SAR polarimetric parameters', 'Mapping']",,"This study acknowledges the problem of land cover demarcation in diverse vegetation condition. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index is used for the preparation of base map. Further identification of mix and incorrect classes was done using ground truth. Radar data in combination with optical indices are used. In different NDVI classes, rRV with additional criteria on Normalized Difference Water Index successfully demarcated waterlogged area, polarization ratio rRV/rRH and backscattering coefficient rRH are found suitable to separate bare land from dry grass land, sparse and dense scrub could be separated by - (rRV ? rRH)/2 and NDVI is efficient to identify dense vegetation. The study area is taken as Keoladeo National Park in Bharatpur, India. Statistical similarity between ground truth and classified class has been assessed using Jaccard coefficient (JC), Jaccard distance (JD), Dice coefficient (DC) and F-score. High similarity values of JC, JD, DC and F-score are achieved for all land cover types except bare land. Although, dry grassland showed low value of F-score; the reason could be low precision of class. The overall accuracy (87.17%), producer’s accuracy (86.39%), user’s accuracy (85.81%) and Kappa Coefficient (0.84) are also utilized to analyze performance of classifier."
Characterizing wafer stage transmission errors via binary decision diagram and dynamic fault tree,2018,"['Wafer stage', 'Kinematic accuracy', 'Fault tree analysis', 'Binary decision diagram', 'Dynamic fault tree analysis']",,"The wafer stage, as a key subsystem of the dual-stage lithographic tool, possesses the characteristic of high moving accuracy. The fault tree analysis (FTA), which plays an important role in the design stage of the wafer stage, is performed to distinguish the critical events leading to the overall transmission error. However, in view of the complexity of the wafer stage’s structure and operation mechanism, the binary decision diagrams and dynamic fault tree analysis methods are implemented in this paper to obtain a simplified calculation process and a supplement with the dynamic characteristic respectively. This is not achieved by the traditional FTA method. The event “wafer stage’s repetitive error along X axis exceeds 5 nm” is viewed as the top event of the fault tree. In this paper, we identify the critical factors affecting the kinematic accuracy of the wafer stage."
An FPT 2-Approximation for Tree-Cut Decomposition,2018,,,"<P>The tree-cut width of a graph is a graph parameter defined by Wollan (J Combin Theory, Ser B, 110:47-66, 2015) with the help of tree-cut decompositions. In certain cases, tree-cut width appears to be more adequate than treewidth as an invariant that, when bounded, can accelerate the resolution of intractable problems. While designing algorithms for problems with bounded tree-cut width, it is important to have a parametrically tractable way to compute the exact value of this parameter or, at least, some constant approximation of it. In this paper we give a parameterized 2-approximation algorithm for the computation of tree-cut width; for an input n-vertex graph G and an integer w, our algorithm either confirms that the tree-cut width of G is more than w or returns a tree-cut decomposition of G certifying that its tree-cut width is at most 2w, in time . Prior to this work, no constructive parameterized algorithms, even approximated ones, existed for computing the tree-cut width of a graph. As a consequence of the Graph Minors series by Robertson and Seymour, only the existence of a decision algorithm was known.</P>"

Investment Decision Making under Uncertainty Using Real Options Approach: A Case Study in Solar Power Plants of Iran,2018,"['Project Valuation', 'Real Options', 'Photovoltaic System', 'Uncertainty', 'Binomial Tree Method', 'Taguchi design Experiments']",,"Nowadays, classic Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) approach is mostly used in order to evaluate various types ofprojects. Since projects in all around the world are confronting with different barriers, such as high risk, various kindsof uncertainty, the aforesaid classic approach cannot correctly determine the value of projects. Therefore, proposingpractical and efficient approaches in evaluation of project in uncertain environment has drawn the attention of researchersin recent years. In this study, an efficient approach for valuing of solar photovoltaic power plants in Iranwith real options is proposed and compared with the classic DCF approach. In order to evaluate the assumed real options,the binomial tree method is implemented. Eventually, Taguchi design experiment is used to analyze the performanceof binomial tree and figure out how real options parameters effect on the value of project. The obtained resultsshow that considering abovementioned real options increases the value of project comparing to the case with no realoptions (i.e. DCF approach). Moreover, the ranking of effective factors, participations percentage of each factors onresponse variable, and optimal combination of them are determined."

The study is based on the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES VI and VII) from 2013 to 2016. Methods: The sociodemographic and clinical data of 504 Korean cancer survivors aged 20-64 years was extracted from the KNHANES VI and VII database. Descriptive statistics for complex samples was used, and decision-tree analyses were performed using the SPSS WIN 24.0 program. Results: The mean age for survivors was approximately 51 years. The mean sleep duration was 6.97 hours; 36.2% of participants had short (<7 hours) and 9.9% had long (>8 hours) sleep duration. From the decision-trees analyses, the characteristics of the adult cancer survivors related to sleep problems were presented with six different pathways. Sleep problems were analyzed according to the survivors’ sociodemographic information (age, education, living status, and occupation), clinical characteristics (body mass index, hypercholesterolemia, and anemia) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The HRQoL (≤0.5 or >0.5 cutoff point) was a significant predictor of the participants’ sleep problems because all six pathways were started from this predictor in the model. Conclusion: Health care professionals could use the decision-tree model for screening adult cancer survivors with sleep problems in clinical or community settings. Nursing interventions considering these specific individual characteristics and HRQoL level should be developed to have adequate sleep duration for Korean adult cancer survivors."

As a result of the decision tree analysis, a total 16 nodes of Internet overdependence risk groups were identified. The main predicated variables were the amount of time spent per smart media usage in weekdays; amount of time spent per smart media usage in weekends; experiences of purchasing cash items; percentage of using smart media for leisure; negative personality; percentage of using smart media for information search and utilization; and awareness on good functions of the Internet, all of which in order had greater impact on the risk groups. Users in the highest risk node spent the smart media for more than 5 minutes per use and less than 5~10 minutes in weekdays, had experiences of cash item purchase, and had lower level of awareness on the good functions of the Internet. The analysis led to the following recommendations: First, even a short-time use has higher chances of causing Internet overdependence, and therefore, guidelines need to be developed based on research on the usage behavior rather than the usage time. Second, self-regulation is required because factors that affect overindulgence in games, such as the cash items, increase Internet overdependence. Third, using the Internet for leisure causes higher risk of overdependence and therefore, other means of leisure should be recommended."

The reason of the study is that the elderly welfare center as a provider of general welfare services could not only thinking about the state policy but also need to consider about the inherent role and function of the elderly. Especially for these elders living in rural areas, although the number of elderly welfare centers of the whole country has greatly increased in last 10 years, the effect and function of the facility are almost the same and they are still lack of leisure activities. This issue become a serious problem nowadays. For the above reasons, this article conducts a social survey of 360 elderly people over the age of 65 who lives in the Gimpo city which is a rural-urban type city. The research method is to examine the relationship between the predisposing factors, enabling factors and need factors of Andersen’s behavior model with binary logistic regression analysis and the decision tree analysis.The result of binary logistic regression shows the most of factors of Andersen’s model is significant. The factors of age, gender, education level in predisposing factors; monthly income in enabling factors and the reserve for old life, the preparation of economic activity for old life in need factors are significant. Then the result of decision tree analysis shows the interaction between factors; when the education level in predisposing factors is higher, the possibility of using of elderly welfare center becomes bigger. Also as the level of healthy promoting preparation in the need factors gets lower, the possibility of using of elderly welfare center still becomes bigger. Although differences were found in the interpretation of the results of regression analysis and decision tree analysis, the results of this study can still provide support for the necessity of elderly welfare centers providing integrated welfare services."

METHODS: To improve the proposed overall rehabilitation decision tree, current decision tree from Korea and decision trees from other countries were summarized and investigated. The problem when applying the current rehabilitation method obtained from the decision tree applied in Seoul was further analyzed. It was found that the current decision trees do not consider different distress characteristics such as crack type, road types and functions. Because of this, different distress values for IRI, crack rate and plastic deformation was added to the proposed decision tree to properly recommend appropriate pavement rehabilitation. Utilizing the 2017 Seoul pavement management system data and considering all factors as discussed, the proposed overall decision tree was revised and improved. RESULTS: In this study, the type of crack was included to the decision tree. Meanwhile current design thickness and special asphalt mixture were studied and improved to be applied on different pavement condition. In addition, the improved decision tree was incorporated with the Seoul asphalt overlay design program. In the case of Seoul's rehabilitation budget, rehabilitation budget can be optimized if a 25mm milling and overlay thickness is used. CONCLUSIONS: A practical and theoretical evaluation tool in pavement rehabilitation design was presented and proposed for Seoul City."

Distinguishing between closely related species of Allium and of Brassicaceae by narrowband hyperspectral imagery,2018,"['Classification', 'Decision-tree classifier', 'Full width at half maximum', 'Hyperspectral imagery', 'Spectral band']",,"<P>Classification of crop species is an actively studied topic in remote sensing using multispectral image sensors. Unfortunately, the spectral bands available in the multispectral imagery are broad and limited in number to classify the crop species. In this paper, we propose optimal spectral bands to classify Allium (garlic and onion) and Brassicaceae (Chinese cabbage and radish) by using higher-dimensional data from hyperspectral imagery. A decision-tree classifier was used to determine the optimal method to use the high-dimensional data. The high-dimensional data were analysed for all growth stages and considering bandwidths with different full width at half maximum (FWHM) values at 25, 40, 50 and 80 nm. The spectral bands selected for Allium were differentiated into green, blue, and NIR bands for each growth stage. The results show that Allium can be classified clearly as overall accuracy (OA) 1 and kappa coefficient 1 for all FWHM based on March 22 data. For each April 19 and May 12 data, the decision-tree classifier with each 80 nm FWHM and 50 nm FWHM yielded a better classification accuracy of more than OA 0.921 and kappa coefficient 0.839 than other FWHM. The spectral bands selected for Brassicaceae were found to be similar to blue band for all growth stages. Brassicaceae was classified clearly for all FWHM based on October 27 data. Also, Brassicaceae was classified clearly for 25 nm FWHM based on November 25 data and OA, kappa coefficient for 40 nm FWHM and 50 nm FWHM are high as 0.974, 0.947 respectively.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  We propose commercial band pass filters to identify Allium and Brassicaceae. </LI> <LI>  Decision-tree classifier based on hyperspectral data selects the spectral filters. </LI> <LI>  Hyperspectral data analysed depending on growth stages and different filter bandwidth. </LI> <LI>  Allium is efficiently classified in Green, Blue and NIR bands for each growth stage. </LI> <LI>  Brassicaceae is classified in Blue bands throughout all growth stages. </LI> </UL> </P>"

An online questionnaire was fielded to confirm predictions, and regression analysis was conducted to verify the model's validity. The results show that a promotion focus does not have a significantly positive effect on the automation level at which consumers will adopt AVs, but a prevention focus has a significantly positive effect on conditional AV adoption. Consumer innovativeness, consumers’ novelty-seeking have a significantly positive relationship with high and full AV adoption, and consumers’ independent decision-making has a significantly positive effect on full AV adoption. The higher the level of automation at which a consumer adopts AVs, the higher the willingness to pay for them. Finally, using a neural network and decision tree analyses, we show methods with which to describe three categories for potential adopters of AVs."

Using the derived rules, we proposed helpful strategies for improving the winning rate. Third, we derived four winning rules for both playoff teams and non-playoff teams; using the rules we proposed customized strategies for improving the winning rate of the two different groups. Finally, we confirmed the feasibility of the proposed strategies by comparing non-playoff teams’ actual player recruitment strategies."

As a result, there are three conclusions about it. First, the Ulsan Metropolitan government needs to prepare the countermeasure to encourage company’s interest in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. It is also necessary to establish an ecosystem for the Fourth Industrial Revolution through pre-emptive regulatory reform and system introduction. Second, in order to survive in the future market resulting from the forth revolution, companies in Ulsan city had better be educated on 3D Printing Technology, Big Data Utilization, and Smart Factory Technology. Third, the municipal government and educational institutions should make every effort to cultivate human resources through human resource development policies and educational programs. And the city government also need to inform companies that they try to set policies and programs for Human Resource Development of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The result is that they can help companies gain professional employees easily."
Prediction of concrete compressive strength using non-destructive test results,2018,"['concrete', 'compressive strength', 'machine learning regression', 'non-destructive testing']",,"Concrete which is a composite material is one of the most important construction materials. Compressive strength is a commonly used parameter for the assessment of concrete quality. Accurate prediction of concrete compressive strength is an important issue. In this study, we utilized an experimental procedure for the assessment of concrete quality. Firstly, the concrete mix was prepared according to C 20 type concrete, and slump of fresh concrete was about 20 cm. After the placement of fresh concrete to formworks, compaction was achieved using a vibrating screed. After 28 day period, a total of 100 core samples having 75 mm diameter were extracted. On the core samples pulse velocity determination tests and compressive strength tests were performed. Besides, Windsor probe penetration tests and Schmidt hammer tests were also performed. After setting up the data set, twelve artificial intelligence (AI) models compared for predicting the concrete compressive strength. These models can be divided into three categories (i) Functions (i.e., Linear Regression, Simple Linear Regression, Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vector Regression), (ii) Lazy-Learning Algorithms (i.e., IBk Linear NN Search, KStar, Locally Weighted Learning) (iii) Tree- Based Learning Algorithms (i.e., Decision Stump, Model Trees Regression, Random Forest, Random Tree, Reduced Error Pruning Tree). Four evaluation processes, four validation implements (i.e., 10-fold cross validation, 5-fold cross validation, 10% split sample validation & 20% split sample validation) are used to examine the performance of predictive models. This study shows that machine learning regression techniques are promising tools for predicting compressive strength of concrete."

However, as the table size increases, it takes more time to build or update the table. Since various cyber attacks recently emerge, the security policies in each network security equipment have the higher complexity and their size is rapidly increasing. Thus, existing algorithms can suffer from too large table under this situation. In this paper, we propose a new packet classification approach to resolve this problem. A variety of cut-based packet classification algorithms such as HiCuts and HyperCuts have been developed to search a matching policy fast in network security equipment. Cut-based algorithms are known for fast search performance using a moderate sized table. They usually use only one cutting scheme to build a decision tree. On the other hand, the proposed algorithm simultaneously applies two cutting schemes, therefore reducing the height of the decision tree significantly. In addition, it utilizes cache-aware design for building the decision tree, not only the packet classification speed can be greatly improved, but also the total size of the search table can be greatly reduced."

Prior studies applying data mining techniques for predicting disease can be classified into a model design study for predicting cardiovascular disease and a study comparing disease prediction research results. In the case of foreign literatures, studies predicting cardiovascular disease were predominant in predicting disease using data mining techniques. Although domestic studies were not much different from those of foreign countries, studies focusing on hypertension and diabetes were mainly conducted. Since hypertension and diabetes as well as chronic diseases, hyperlipidemia, are also of high importance, this study selected hyperlipidemia as the disease to be analyzed. We also developed a model for predicting hyperlipidemia using SVM and meta learning algorithms, which are already known to have excellent predictive power.  In order to achieve the purpose of this study, we used data set from Korea Health Panel 2012. The Korean Health Panel produces basic data on the level of health expenditure, health level and health behavior, and has conducted an annual survey since 2008. In this study, 1,088 patients with hyperlipidemia were randomly selected from the hospitalized, outpatient, emergency, and chronic disease data of the Korean Health Panel in 2012, and 1,088 nonpatients were also randomly extracted. A total of 2,176 people were selected for the study.  Three methods were used to select input variables for predicting hyperlipidemia. First, stepwise method was performed using logistic regression. Among the 17 variables, the categorical variables(except for length of smoking) are expressed as dummy variables, which are assumed to be separate variables on the basis of the reference group, and these variables were analyzed. Six variables (age, BMI, education level, marital status, smoking status, gender) excluding income level and smoking period were selected based on significance level 0.1. Second, C4.5 as a decision tree algorithm is used. The significant input variables were age, smoking status, and education level. Finally, C4.5 as a decision tree algorithm is used. In SVM, the input variables selected by genetic algorithms consisted of 6 variables such as age, marital status, education level, economic activity, smoking period, and physical activity status, and the input variables selected by genetic algorithms in artificial neural network consist of 3 variables such as age, marital status, and education level.  Based on the selected parameters, we compared SVM, meta learning algorithm and other prediction models for hyperlipidemia patients, and compared the classification performances using TP rate and precision.  The main results of the analysis are as follows. First, the accuracy of the SVM was 88.4% and the accuracy of the artificial neural network was 86.7%. Second, the accuracy of classification models using the selected input variables through stepwise method was slightly higher than that of classification models using the whole variables. Third, the precision of artificial neural network was higher than that of SVM when only three variables as input variables were selected by decision trees. As a result of classification models based on the input variables selected through the genetic algorithm, classification accuracy of SVM was 88.5% and that of artificial neural network was 87.9%. Finally, this study indicated that stacking as the meta learning algorithm proposed in this study, has the best performance when it uses the predicted outputs of SVM and MLP as input variables of SVM, which is a meta classifier.  The purpose of this study was to predict hyperlipidemia, one of the representative chronic diseases. To do this, we used SVM and meta-learning algorithms, which is known to have high accuracy.

The results indicated that teachers’ judgment of students’ learning difficulties and disabilities was barely consistent with the results of government recommended school-made tests. However, there were somewhat better, but still displayed a noticeable rate of inconsistency between teachers’ judgments and the standardized test results. Teachers had difficulty identifying learning disabilities from difficulties because the definition of both concepts was confusing in the current school system. It was also found that despite the poor information teachers are given, they nonetheless continued doing their best to identify students with learning difficulties and disabilities. The results also implied that if teachers are given accurate information such as standardized results on reading comprehension and phonological processing, the accuracy of teacher’s judgments would improve significantly."
Predicting Surgical Complications in Adult Patients Undergoing Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion Using Machine Learning,2018,"['Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion', 'Predicting', 'Complications', 'Machine Learning', 'Spine']",,"Objective: Machine learning algorithms excel at leveraging big data to identify complex patterns that can be used to aid in clinical decision-making. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the performance of machine learning models in predicting postoperative complications following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF).Methods: Artificial neural network (ANN), logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest decision tree (RF) models were trained on a multicenter data set of patients undergoing ACDF to predict surgical complications based on readily available patient data. Following training, these models were compared to the predictive capability of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification.Results: A total of 20,879 patients were identified as having undergone ACDF. Following exclusion criteria, patients were divided into 14,615 patients for training and 6,264 for testing data sets. ANN and LR consistently outperformed ASA physical status classification in predicting every complication (p<0.05). The ANN outperformed LR in predicting venous thromboembolism, wound complication, and mortality (p<0.05). The SVM and RF models were no better than random chance at predicting any of the postoperative complications (p<0.05).Conclusion: ANN and LR algorithms outperform ASA physical status classification for predicting individual postoperative complications. Additionally, neural networks have greater sensitivity than LR when predicting mortality and wound complications. With the growing size of medical data, the training of machine learning on these large datasets promises to improve risk prognostication, with the ability of continuously learning making them excellent tools in complex clinical scenarios."

In previous studies, prediction models have been proposed by applying or combining statistical and machine learning-based techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel intelligent prediction model based on the simulated annealing which is one of the well-known optimization techniques. The simulated annealing is known to have comparable optimization performance to the genetic algorithms. Nevertheless, since there has been little research on the prediction and classification of business decision-making problems using the simulated annealing, it is meaningful to confirm the usefulness of the proposed model in business analytics. In this study, we use the combined model of simulated annealing and machine learning to select the input features of the bankruptcy prediction model. Typical types of combining optimization and machine learning techniques are feature selection, feature weighting, and instance selection. This study proposes a combining model for feature selection, which has been studied the most. In order to confirm the superiority of the proposed model in this study, we apply the real-world financial data of the Korean companies and analyze the results. The results show that the predictive accuracy of the proposed model is better than that of the naïve model. Notably, the performance is significantly improved as compared with the traditional decision tree, random forests, artificial neural network, SVM, and logistic regression analysis."

In order to validate the spatial/temporal performance (accuracy and efficiency) of the model, a case study on landslide events in 2009 was modeled for early warning state changes. The model, which was developed by adopting the advantages and overcoming the limitations of existing internal and external early warning systems, is expected to function as an effective and rliable diasaster management tool for decision makers."

Furthermore, Land Cover Map (LCM) was also used to verify CO2 absorption rate availability per year. Great variations in CO<sub>2</sub> absorption rates occurred before and after the year 2010. This was due to improvement in precision and accuracy of the Forest Basic Statistics (FBS) in 2010, which resulted in rapid increase in growing stock. Thus, calibration of data prior to 2010 is necessary, based on recent FBS standards. Previous studies that employed Lim5000 and FBS (2015, 2010) did not take into account the CO<sub>2</sub> absorption rates of different tree species, and the combination of SCRMF and Lim5000 resulted in CO<sub>2</sub> absorption of 42,369 ton.

중소기업 프로파일링 분석을 통한 기술유출 방지 및 보호 모형 연구,2018,"['SME', 'Technology Leakage', 'Profiling Analysis', 'Data Mining', 'ICT']",,"PurposeCorporate technology leakage is not only monetary loss, but also has a negative impact on the corporate image and further deteriorates sustainable growth. In particular, since SMEs are highly dependent on core technologies compared to large corporations, loss of technology leakage threatens corporate survival. Therefore, it is important for SMEs to prevent and protect technology leakage. With the recent development of data analysis technology and the opening of public data, it has become possible to discover and proactively detect companies with a high probability of technology leakage based on actual company data. In this study, we try to construct profiles of enterprises with and without technology leakage experience through profiling analysis using data mining techniques. Furthermore, based on this, we propose a classification model that distinguishes companies that are likely to leak technology.Design/methodology/approachThis study tries to develop the empirical model for prevention and protection of technology leakage through profiling method which analyzes each SME from the viewpoint of individual. Based on the previous research, we tried to classify many characteristics of SMEs into six categories and to identify the factors influencing the technology leakage of SMEs from the enterprise point of view. Specifically, we divided the 29 SME characteristics into the following six categories: 'firm characteristics', 'organizational characteristics', 'technical characteristics', 'relational characteristics', 'financial characteristics', and 'enterprise core competencies'. Each characteristic was extracted from the questionnaire data of 'Survey of Small and Medium Enterprises Technology’ carried out annually by the Government of the Republic of Korea. Since the number of SMEs with experience of technology leakage in questionnaire data was significantly smaller than the other, we made a 1: 1 correspondence with each sample through mixed sampling. We conducted profiling of companies with and without technology leakage experience using decision-tree technique for research data, and derived meaningful variables that can distinguish the two. Then, empirical model for prevention and protection of technology leakage was developed through discriminant analysis and logistic regression analysis.FindingsProfiling analysis shows that technology novelty, enterprise technology group, number of intellectual property registrations, product life cycle, technology development infrastructure level(absence of dedicated organization), enterprise core competency(design) and enterprise core competency(process design) help us find SME’s technology leakage. We developed the two empirical model for prevention and protection of technology leakage in SMEs using discriminant analysis and logistic regression analysis, and each hit ratio is 65%(discriminant analysis) and 67%(logistic regression analysis)."

KOSDAQ 시장의 관리종목 지정 탐지 모형 개발,2018,"['관리종목', '로지스틱 회귀분석', '의사결정나무', '코스닥 기업', 'Administrative Issue', 'Logistic Regression', 'Decision Tree', 'KOSDAQ-listed Companies']",,"The purpose of this research is to develop a detection model for companies designated as administrative issue in KOSDAQ market using financial data. Administration issue designates the companies with high potential for delisting, which gives them time to overcome the reasons for the delisting under certain restrictions of the Korean stock market. It acts as an alarm to inform investors and market participants of which companies are likely to be delisted and warns them to make safe investments. Despite this importance, there are relatively few studies on administration issues prediction model in comparison with the lots of studies on bankruptcy prediction model. Therefore, this study develops and verifies the detection model of the companies designated as administrative issue using financial data of KOSDAQ companies. In this study, logistic regression and decision tree are proposed as the data mining models for detecting administrative issues.  According to the results of the analysis, the logistic regression model predicted the companies designated as administrative issue using three variables - ROE(Earnings before tax), Cash flows/Shareholder’s equity, and Asset turnover ratio, and its overall accuracy was 86% for the validation dataset. The decision tree (Classification and Regression Trees, CART) model applied the classification rules using Cash flows/Total assets and ROA(Net income), and the overall accuracy reached 87%.   Implications of the financial indictors selected in our logistic regression and decision tree models are as follows. First, ROE(Earnings before tax) in the logistic detection model shows the profit and loss of the business segment that will continue without including the revenue and expenses of the discontinued business. Therefore, the weakening of the variable means that the competitiveness of the core business is weakened. If a large part of the profits is generated from one-off profit, it is very likely that the deterioration of business management is further intensified. As the ROE of a KOSDAQ company decreases significantly, it is highly likely that the company can be delisted. Second, cash flows to shareholder’s equity represents that the firm`s ability to generate cash flow under the condition that the financial condition of the subsidiary company is excluded. In other words, the weakening of the management capacity of the parent company, excluding the subsidiary`s competence, can be a main reason for the increase of the possibility of administrative issue designation. Third, low asset turnover ratio means that current assets and non-current assets are ineffectively used by corporation, or that asset investment by corporation is excessive. If the asset turnover ratio of a KOSDAQ-listed company decreases, it is necessary to examine in detail corporate activities from various perspectives such as weakening sales or increasing or decreasing inventories of company. Cash flow / total assets, a variable selected by the decision tree detection model, is a key indicator of the companys cash condition and its ability to generate cash from operating activities. Cash flow indicates whether a firm can perform its main activities(maintaining its operating ability, repaying debts, paying dividends and making new investments) without relying on external financial resources. Therefore, if the index of the variable is negative(-), it indicates the possibility that a company has serious problems in business activities. If the cash flow from operating activities of a specific company is smaller than the net profit, it means that the net profit has not been cashed, indicating that there is a serious problem in managing the trade receivables and inventory assets of the company. Therefore, it can be understood that as the cash flows / total assets decrease, the probability of administrative issue designation and the probability of delisting are increased.  In summary, the logistic regression-based detectio"

The decision tree brings about five useful rules and their average classification accuracy is quite high (75.8%). In addition, the decision tree showed that high blood pressure and waist circumference are the most influential factors on the classification of the two groups. Our research results will serve as good guidelines for clinicians to provide better treatment for patients with MS, such that they do not develop diabetes."

The proposed model consists of three steps: segmentation and partitioning of trajectory step, feature extraction step, and behavioral learning step. First, the entire trajectory is fuzzy partitioned according to the motion characteristics, and then temporal features and spatial features are extracted. Using the extracted features, four pedestrian behaviors were modeled by decision tree learning algorithm and performance evaluation was performed. The experiments in this paper were conducted using Caviar data sets. Experimental results show that trajectory provides good activity recognition accuracy by extracting instantaneous property and distinctive regional property."

The present study examines botanical facts of the Kaizuka juniper, which is widely planted in historical sites around Korea. It delves into the issue by taking up the case of the alleged commemoration planting of two Kaizuka junipers by Joseon’s King Sunjong and Ito Hirobumi at the Dalseong historical site on January 12, 1909.The Japanese name, Kaizukaibuki, first appeared in 1928 in a plant nursery’s catalog at Yokohama, Japan. It is a horticultural product of Chinese juniper (Juniperus chinensis) which is phylogenetically endemic to the East Sea rim area with the Korean Peninsula at the center. Chronologically, there is no ground to believe that the trees planted in Dalseong were Kaizukaibuki; in fact, even such a tree name was nonexistent in the world in 1909. Furthermore, any tree planted in mid January could not have survived the frigid winter weather in Korea. These facts point to the possibility that the story of the two figures planting Kaizukabuki in Dalseong was fabricated.This situation seems to have resulted from the critical omission of paragraphs on the commemoration planting in Daegu iyagi (the Story of Daegu), the only Korean translation of Kawai’s 1930 Taikyū Monogatari (『大邱物語』). We conclude that there is no association between the two large old Kaizukaibuki trees in Dalseong and the story of commemoration planting by the King and Ito, and that the Kaizukaibuki is, in fact, a Korean ethnobotanical plant, Juniperus chinensis. In future research, a biosociological analysis needs to be made on the infiltration of closed exclusivism embued in the Japanese invasionist view of history, when it comes to the landscape restoration of historical sites, including the selection or exclusion of specific plant species."

This study tried to find the most significant factors predicting implant prognosis using machine learning methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS. The data used in this study was based on a systematic search of chart files at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital for one year. In this period, oral and maxillofacial surgeons inserted 667 implants in 198 patients after consultation with a prosthodontist. The traditional statistical methods were inappropriate in this study, which analyzed the data of a small sample size to find a factor affecting the prognosis. The machine learning methods were used in this study, since these methods have analyzing power for a small sample size and are able to find a new factor that has been unknown to have an effect on the result. A decision tree model and a support vector machine were used for the analysis. RESULTS. The results identified mesio-distal position of the inserted implant as the most significant factor determining its prognosis. Both of the machine learning methods, the decision tree model and support vector machine, yielded the similar results. CONCLUSION. Dental clinicians should be careful in locating implants in the patient's mouths, especially mesio-distally, to minimize the negative complications against implant survival."
"Assessing the impact of air pollution on mortality rate from cardiovascular disease in Seoul, Korea",2018,"['Air pollution', 'Cardiovascular disease', 'Decision tree model', 'PM2.5', 'Temperature']",,"The adverse health impact of air pollution is becoming more serious. The purpose of this study is twofold: One is to analyze the effect of air pollution and temperatures on human health by analyzing the number of deaths from cardiovascular disease in Seoul, Korea; the other is to determine what impact the location of a monitoring site has on the results of a health study. For this latter purpose, air pollution and temperature monitors are sited at three locations termed green, public, and residential. Then, a decision tree model is used to analyze factors linked with deaths occurring at each monitoring site. The results show that the environmental temperatures before death and the PM2.5 concentrations on the day of death are highly linked with the number of deaths regardless of the monitoring location. However, results are most accurate with residential data. The results of this study can be used as base data for a similar analysis and ultimately, as a guide to minimize the health impact of air pollution."

Thus it is difficult to know how much they are exposed to crime. If the police can predict the crime risky area, it will be possible to cope with the crime efficiently even though insufficient police and enforcement resources. However, there is no prediction system in Korea and the related researches are very much poor. From these backgrounds, the final goal of this study is to develop an automated crime prediction system. However, for the first step, we build a big data set which consists of local real crime information and urban physicalor non-physical data. Then, we developed a crime prediction model through machine learning method. Finally, we assumed several possible scenarios and calculated the probability of crime and visualized the results in a map so as to increase the people's understanding. Among the factors affecting the crime occurrence revealed in previous and case studies, data was processed in the form of a big data for machine learning: real crime information, weather information (temperature, rainfall, wind speed, humidity, sunshine, insolation, snowfall, cloud cover) and local information (average building coverage, average floor area ratio, average building height, number of buildings, average appraised land value, average area of residential building, average number of ground floor). Among the supervised machine learning algorithms, the decision tree model, the random forest model, and the SVM model, which are known to be powerful and accurate in various fields were utilized to construct crime prevention model. As a result, decision tree model with the lowest RMSE was selected as an optimal prediction model. Based on this model, several scenarios were set for theft and violence cases which are the most frequent in the case city J, and the probability of crime was estimated by 250x250m grid. As a result, we could find that the high crime risky area is occurring in three patterns in case city J. The probability of crime was divided into three classes and visualized in map by 250 x 250m grid. Finally, we could develop a crime prediction model using machine learning algorithm and visualized the crime risky areas in a map which can recalculate the model and visualize the result simultaneously as time and urban conditions change."

The second most satisfying group is the group of people who are lower- income and active in community activities. On the other hand, the group of people who are high-income and inactive in community activities are included to unsatisfying groups. These findings suggest that community participation can be a m ajor factor in enhancing the quality of life of residents in the rural communities. What is noteworthy is that m arital status is used as a major variable to classify the rural residents into some groups according to the level of community satisfaction.

However, in the case of the screen content video coding, it is difficult to apply the conventional early partition decision method because it shows different partition characteristics from natural content. The proposed method solves the problem by classifying the screen content blocks after partition decision, and it shows an increase of 3.11% BD-BR and 42% time reduction compared to the SCC common test condition."
Improving the Reliability of Pumped-Storage Power Plants in the Operational Phases using Data Mining Algorithms,2018,"['reliability', 'data mining', 'artificial intelligence', 'decision tree', 'case based reasoning', 'factor subset selection']",,"The sudden breakdowns of the power generation facilities caused a serious concern about the stable operation of the power system.However, since electricity system in South Korea is not connected to neighboring country, it is necessary to devise methods to counteract emergency such as unexpected failure of a power plant or sudden increase of electric power demand. In response, South Korea is operating seven pumped-storage power plants whose capacity is equal to that of about five nuclear power plants, accounts for 5.9% of the total power capacity of South Korea. The pumped turbine is a machine that operates through forward and reverse rotations to store energy and produce electric power. It requires high reliability for rapidly generating electricity on load. The losses caused by the shutdown of the power plants due to turbine failures, and the costs of their recovery, are enormous. Thus, improving the reliability of a pumped-storage power plant will have a significant influence on the national power system. In this regard, this research seeks to increase the reliability of the pumped storage power plant by identifying the problematic factors. This study proposes models of Case Based Reasoning (CBR) for eliminating possible problematic factors in pumped storage power plants before operation phase through predicting and checking failure. The development of the model involves analyzing operational data from 36 pumped-storage power plants; conducting decision tree analysis on 19 problems in order to select significant problems; and developing CBR models which can predict and check possible problems to improve the reliability of the pumped-storage power plant."

Raw data are divided into training data and test data. The order of predictability in training data is neural network, decision tree, and logistic regression. On the contrary, the results of test data show that logistic regression is the best model. This means that logistic regression has more data adaptability than neural network which is developed as the model optimized for training data. Determinants of initial sale are the location of floor, direction, the location of unit, the proximity of electricity and generator room, subscriber’s residential region and the type of subscription. This suggests that using two models together is more effective in exploring determinants of initial sales. This paper contributes to the development of convergence field by expanding the scope of data mining."

The more rigid sex role attitude is cumulated, the more rate of sex violence is increased. But in the case of sexual assertative factors, its tendency is reverse. Its means that self assertative factor were linked self esteem on the sexual offender. Empathy were significant variables on middle school adolescents. Especially, the most important variables were non empathic attitude linked sex violence tolerance. These results mean that the intervention about self esteem is not appropriate for youth at risk. The interactive offender-victim discriminant model suggested in this study was more valid and appropriate model than single independent perspective on the risk and protective factors model for youth at risk that suggested in studies.

Also missing covariates in the data are imputed using single imputation method. Using cluster analysis patients were classified to two clusters. Using survival analysis there was significant difference in recurrence time between the two clusters (p < 0.001). In the decision tree analysis in each cluster, different risk factors were chosen as the best optimal partitioning variables. In the first cluster, types of surgery, indication of surgery and time interval was chosen as the best optimal partitioning variable. On the other hand time interval was chosen in the second cluster. The result of this study suggest that different prediction model are necessary for different cluster group. Determining patient’s gender, disease status, family history etc, which can be termed as personalized medicine is in the limelight.

An Efficient One Class Classifier Using Gaussian-based Hyper-Rectangle Generation,2018,"['Imbalanced Dataset', 'One-Class Classification', 'Classifier Using Hyper-Rectangle', 'Classification Rate', 'Interpretability']",,"In recent years, imbalanced data is one of the most important and frequent issue for quality control in industrial field. As an example, defect rate has been drastically reduced thanks to highly developed technology and quality management, so that only few defective data can be obtained from production process. Therefore, quality classification should be performed under the condition that one class (defective dataset) is even smaller than the other class (good dataset). However, traditional multi-class classification methods are not appropriate to deal with such an imbalanced dataset, since they classify data from the difference between one class and the others that can hardly be found in imbalanced datasets. Thus, one-class classification that thoroughly learns patterns of target class is more suitable for imbalanced dataset since it only focuses on data in a target class. So far, several one-class classification methods such as one-class support vector machine, neural network and decision tree there have been suggested. One-class support vector machine and neural network can guarantee good classification rate, and decision tree can provide a set of rules that can be clearly interpreted. However, the classifiers obtained from the former two methods consist of complex mathematical functions and cannot be easily understood by users. In case of decision tree, the criterion for rule generation is ambiguous. Therefore, as an alternative, a new one-class classifier using hyper-rectangles was proposed, which performs precise classification compared to other methods and generates rules clearly understood by users as well. In this paper, we suggest an approach for improving the limitations of those previous one-class classification algorithms. Specifically, the suggested approach produces more improved one-class classifier using hyper-rectangles generated by using Gaussian function. The performance of the suggested algorithm is verified by a numerical experiment, which uses several datasets in UCI machine learning repository."

Those text data were produced and distributed through various media platforms such as World Wide Web, Internet news feeds, microblog, and social media. However, this enormous amount of easily obtained information is lack of organization. Therefore, this problem has raised the interest of many researchers in order to manage this huge amount of information. Further, this problem also required professionals that are capable of classifying relevant information and hence text classification is introduced. Text classification is a challenging task in modern data analysis, which it needs to assign a text document into one or more predefined categories or classes. In text classification field, there are different kinds of techniques available such as K-Nearest Neighbor, Naïve Bayes Algorithm, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Artificial Neural Network.  However, while dealing with huge amount of text data, model performance and accuracy becomes a challenge. According to the type of words used in the corpus and type of features created for classification, the performance of a text classification model can be varied. Most of the attempts are been made based on proposing a new algorithm or modifying an existing algorithm. This kind of research can be said already reached their certain limitations for further improvements. In this study, aside from proposing a new algorithm or modifying the algorithm, we focus on searching a way to modify the use of data. It is widely known that classifier performance is influenced by the quality of training data upon which this classifier is built. The real world datasets in most of the time contain noise, or in other words noisy data, these can actually affect the decision made by the classifiers built from these data. In this study, we consider that the data from different domains, which is heterogeneous data might have the characteristics of noise which can be utilized in the classification process.  In order to build the classifier, machine learning algorithm is performed based on the assumption that the characteristics of training data and target data are the same or very similar to each other. However, in the case of unstructured data such as text, the features are determined according to the vocabularies included in the document. If the viewpoints of the learning data and target data are different, the features may be appearing different between these two data. In this study, we attempt to improve the classification accuracy by strengthening the robustness of the document classifier through artificially injecting the noise into the process of constructing the document classifier.  With data coming from various kind of sources, these data are likely formatted differently. These cause difficulties for traditional machine learning algorithms because they are not developed to recognize different type of data representation at one time and to put them together in same generalization. Therefore, in order to utilize heterogeneous data in the learning process of document classifier, we apply semi-supervised learning in our study. However, unlabeled data might have the possibility to degrade the performance of the document classifier. Therefore, we further proposed a method called Rule Selection-Based Ensemble Semi-Supervised Learning Algorithm (RSESLA) to select only the documents that contributing to the accuracy improvement of the classifier. RSESLA creates multiple views by manipulating the features using different types of classification models and different types of heterogeneous data. The most confident classification rules will be selected and applied for the final decision making. In this paper, three different types of real-world data sources were used, which are news, twitter and blogs."

Using the Korean National Hospital Discharge In-depth Injury Survey from 2006 to 2015, the study population with disease code I60-I63 (KCD 7) were extracted for further analysis. Three tools were used for the severity-adjustment of comorbidity: the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), the Elixhauser comorbidity index (ECI), and the Clinical Classification Software (CCS). The severity-adjustment models for mortality prediction in patients with acute stroke were developed using logistic regression, decision tree, neural network, and support vector machine methods. The most common comorbid disease in stroke patients were hypertension, uncomplicated (43.8%) in the ECI, and essential hypertension (43.9%) in the CCS. Among the CCI, ECI, and CCS, CCS had the highest AUC value. CCS was confirmed as the best severity correction tool. In addition, the AUC values for variables of CCS including main diagnosis, gender, age, hospitalization route, and existence of surgery were 0.808 for the logistic regression analysis, 0.785 for the decision tree, 0.809 for the neural network and 0.830 for the support vector machine. Therefore, the best predictive power was achieved by the support vector machine technique. The results of this study can be used in the establishment of health policy in the future."
A New Scoring System for the Differential Diagnosis between Tuberculous Meningitis and Viral Meningitis,2018,"['Scoring System', 'Tuberculous Meningitis', 'Viral Meningitis']",,"Background: Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is associated with high mortality and morbidity despite administering anti-tuberculous chemotherapy to the patients. Differential diagnosis between TBM and viral meningitis (VM) is difficult in some clinical situations.Methods: We reviewed and analyzed records of adult patients who were admitted and diagnosed with TBM or VM at a tertiary hospital in Korea, between January 2006 and December 2015. Diagnostic criteria for TBM were categorized into three groups: definite, probable, and possible TBM. The VM group included patients with no evidence of other meningitis who achieved complete recovery with only conservative treatments. Clinical, laboratory and radiological findings, as well as outcomes, were compared between the TBM and VM groups.Results: Ninety-eight patients were enrolled. Among the study patients, 47 had TBM and 51 had VM. Based on univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression, sodium < 135 mmol/L in serum (hyponatremia), lactate dehydrogenase > 70 (U/L) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), protein > 160 (mg/dL) in CSF, voiding difficulty, and symptoms of cranial nerve palsy were significant predictive factors for TBM in the final model. We constructed a weighted scoring system with predictive factors from multiple regression analyses. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses and decision tree analyses were plotted to reveal an optimum cutoff point as 4 with this scoring system (range: 0–13).Conclusion: For differential diagnosis between TBM and VM, we created a new weighted scoring system. This scoring system and decision tree analysis are simple and easy to apply in clinical practice to differentiate TBM from VM."

However, lead-acid batteries have a serious problem in that deterioration of a battery makes progress quickly in the presence of that degradation of only one cell among several cells which is packed in a battery begins. To overcome this problem, previous researches have attempted to identify the mechanism of deterioration of a battery in many ways. However, most of previous researches have used data obtained in a laboratory to analyze the mechanism of deterioration of a battery but not used data obtained in a real world. The usage of real data can increase the feasibility and the applicability of the findings of a research. Therefore, this study aims to develop a model which predicts the battery deterioration using data obtained in real world. To this end, we collected data which presents change of battery state by attaching sensors enabling to monitor the battery condition in real time to dozens of golf carts operated in the real golf field. As a result, total 16,883 samples were obtained. And then, we developed a model which predicts a precursor phenomenon representing deterioration of a battery by analyzing the data collected from the sensors using machine learning techniques. As initial independent variables, we used 1) inbound time of a cart, 2) outbound time of a cart, 3) duration(from outbound time to charge time), 4) charge amount, 5) used amount, 6) charge efficiency, 7) lowest temperature of battery cell 1 to 6, 8) lowest voltage of battery cell 1 to 6, 9) highest voltage of battery cell 1 to 6, 10) voltage of battery cell 1 to 6 at the beginning of operation, 11) voltage of battery cell 1 to 6 at the end of charge, 12) used amount of battery cell 1 to 6 during operation, 13) used amount of battery during operation(Max-Min), 14) duration of battery use, and 15) highest current during operation. Since the values of the independent variables, lowest temperature of battery cell 1 to 6, lowest voltage of battery cell 1 to 6, highest voltage of battery cell 1 to 6, voltage of battery cell 1 to 6 at the beginning of operation, voltage of battery cell 1 to 6 at the end of charge, and used amount of battery cell 1 to 6 during operation are similar to that of each battery cell, we conducted principal component analysis using verimax orthogonal rotation in order to mitigate the multiple collinearity problem. According to the results, we made new variables by averaging the values of independent variables clustered together, and used them as final independent variables instead of origin variables, thereby reducing the dimension. We used decision tree, logistic regression, Bayesian network as algorithms for building prediction models. And also, we built prediction models using the bagging of each of them, the boosting of each of them, and RandomForest. Experimental results show that the prediction model using the bagging of decision tree yields the best accuracy of 89.3923%. This study has some limitations in that the additional variables which affect the deterioration of battery such as weather (temperature, humidity) and driving habits, did not considered, therefore, we would like to consider the them in the future research. However, the battery deterioration prediction model proposed in the present study is expected to enable effective and efficient management of battery used in the real filed by dramatically and to reduce the cost caused by not detecting battery deterioration accordingly."

Field data were measured from six plots of 2400 m2 at three different locations. Species diversity and species wise contribution to total biomass carbon (TBC) were also analyzed. Heritiera fomes has maintained its dominance (53.8%, relative density) of the stand. The mean above- and below-ground biomass carbon stock of the mangrove community was 76.8 Mg ha¡1 and 41.1 Mg ha¡1, respectively.Avicennia officinalis contributed the highest TBC accumulation. Individuals of different mangrove species having diameter  9.99 cm constituted more than 72% of the mangrove stand but contributed less in carbon accumulation, representing only 15.6% of the TBC. While individuals having diameter in the 10–56 cm range constituted only 28% of stand density but contributed to high carbon accumulation, representing 84.4% of the TBC. Mangrove communities growing along the oligohaline zone of the SRF show high species richness and carbon stock, indicating their ecological significance, This needs to be considered in future decision making processes for the area as well as in understanding the role of SRF on mitigating the effects of climate change."

Therefore, reducing the dimensionality of hyperspectral imagery is necessary.

The result shows that using the selected bands presents an excellent classification accuracy without using whole datasets. Moreover, a majority of selected bands are concentrated on visible (VIS) region, especially region related to chlorophyll content.

Among them, association rules are defined by using various association evaluation criteria such as support, confidence, and lift. Agrawal et al. (1993) first proposed this association rule, and since then research has been conducted by many scholars. Recently, studies related to crossover entropy have been published (Park, 2016b). In this paper, we proposed a purely symmetric J measure considering directionality and purity in the previously published J measure, and examined its usefulness by using examples. As a result, it is found that the pure symmetric J measure changes more clearly than the conventional J measure, the symmetric J measure, and the pure crossover entropy measure as the frequency of coincidence increases. The variation of the pure symmetric J measure was also larger depending on the magnitude of the inconsistency, and the presence or absence of the association was more clearly understood."
A 0.55 V 1.1 mW Artificial Intelligence Processor With On-Chip PVT Compensation for Autonomous Mobile Robots,2018,,,"<P>Autonomous mobile robots are receiving a lot of attention for many applications, such as package delivery and smart surveillance, however, the battery capacity is limited to implement intelligent decision making in robots because of the heavy computational costs. In this paper, an ultra-low-power artificial intelligence processor (AIP) is proposed for real-time decision making of autonomous mobile robots. To achieve low power consumption while maintaining high performance, it adopts four key features: 1) an 8-thread tree search processor for real-time path planning; 2) a reinforcement learning accelerator for the avoidance of unexpected obstacles; 3) a 3-level transposition table cache for the reduction of duplicated computations; and 4) a PVT compensation circuit for the stable operation at near-threshold voltage. The proposed 16 mm <TEX>$^{{{2}}}$</TEX> AIP is fabricated using 65-nm triple-well CMOS technology. It consumes only 1.1 mW at 0.55 V supply voltage and 7 MHz operating frequency, and 151 mW at 1.2 V supply voltage and 245 MHz operating frequency. The AIP achieves fast search speed (470 000 search/s) and low energy consumption (79 nJ/search), and it is successfully applied to a battery-powered robot system for autonomous navigation without any collision in dynamic indoor environments.</P>"

We used 432 sensor data from actual manufacturing plant collected for about 5 months to find out the variables that show a significant difference between the stable process period with low defect rate and the unstable process period with high defect rate. We set the range of the stable value of the variable to determine whether the selected final variable actually has an effect on the defect rate improvement. In addition, we measured the effect of the defect rate improvement by adjusting the process set-point so that the sensor did not deviate from the stable value range in the 14 day process. Through this, we expect to be able to provide empirical guidelines to improve the defect rate by utilizing and analyzing the process sensor data generated in the manufacturing industry."

As a result, the cross entropy is an unbalanced measure considering only a part of the confidence measures. The balanced cross entropy is a measure that takes account of all confidence measures, but the terms in each log term are not mutually exclusive. On the other hand, purely balanced cross entropy is a measure by which denominator and molecule are not affected by each other. In addition, when we compare the variation of the values of the cross entropy, the balanced cross entropy, and the purely balanced cross entropy, the purely balanced cross entropy becomes the largest."

Therefore, it is necessary to develop a predictive model to consider not only retail format choice (i.e., national chains or traditional market) but also the possibility of cross-shopping derived from the partial churn. In order to predict retail format choice and degree of cross shopping, the current study used logistic regression analysis, decision tree, random forest, GBM, neural network models, which can be simultaneously used for classification model and regression model. In order for the degree of cross-shopping, the visits to the favorite retail format for each shopper and the visits to the alternative store format were used as dependent variables. The ensemble method such as random forest and boosting were the most superior model in predicting the retail format choice. Through the appropriate use of machine learning method, superior prediction is possible from the retail format choice for each shopper to the degree of the cross shopping, affecting more effective customer relationship management (CRM)."
Using Statistical and Machine Learning Methods to Evaluate the Prognostic Accuracy of SIRS and qSOFA,2018,"['Sepsis', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Medical Informatics', 'Artificial Intelligence']",,"Objectives: The objective of this study was to compare the performance of two popularly used early sepsis diagnostic criteria, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), using statistical and machine learning approaches. Methods: This retrospective study examined patient visits in Emergency Department (ED) with sepsis related diagnosis. The outcome was 28-day in-hospital mortality. Using odds ratio (OR) and modeling methods (decision tree [DT], multivariate logistic regression [LR], and naïve Bayes [NB]), the relationships between diagnostic criteria and mortality were examined. Results: Of 132,704 eligible patient visits, 14% died within 28 days of ED admission.The association of qSOFA ≥2 with mortality (OR = 3.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.96–3.17) greater than the association of SIRS ≥2 with mortality (OR = 1.22; 95% CI, 1.18–1.26). The area under the ROC curve for qSOFA (AUROC = 0.70) was significantly greater than for SIRS (AUROC = 0.63). For qSOFA, the sensitivity and specificity were DT = 0.39, LR = 0.64, NB = 0.62 and DT = 0.89, LR = 0.63, NB = 0.66, respectively. For SIRS, the sensitivity and specificity were DT = 0.46, LR = 0.62, NB = 0.62 and DT = 0.70, LR = 0.59, NB = 0.58, respectively. Conclusions: The evidences suggest that qSOFA is a better diagnostic criteria than SIRS. The low sensitivity of qSOFA can be improved by carefully selecting the threshold to translate the predicted probabilities into labels. These findings can guide healthcare providers in selecting risk-stratification measures for patients presenting to an ED with sepsis."

The Sarfartoq carbonatite complex hosts ore deposits and occurrences of rare earth elements and niobium. In this study, airborne HyMap hyperspectral imagery and coincident airborne gamma-ray spectroscopy data were analysed for mineral exploration of Sarfartoq carbonatite complex. The study area included the carbonatite core zone and a hydrothermally altered shear zone prospective for rare earth elements mineralization in the southern margin of the carbonatite complex. The analysis of the hyperspectral imagery was focused on the mapping of the spatial distribution of carbonatite, fenite and limonite. Significant anomalies of uranium, thorium and potassium were outlined from the gamma-ray spectroscopy data. Decision trees were used to combine the results from the hyperspectral image analysis and airborne gamma-ray spectroscopy. Significant anomalies of thorium at the hydrothermally altered shear zone coinciding with the presence of carbonatite rocks are generally indicative of outcropping rare earth element mineralization. The study indicates the benefits of coincident airborne hyperspectral and gamma-ray spectroscopy surveys for the mineral exploration of carbonatite complexes."

A frame-based kidnapping detection scheme is generated according to the selection of J48 decision tree model from the comparison of several representative classification models. When a video has more frames of kidnapping situation than the threshold ratio after two people meet in the video, the proposed scheme detects and notifies the occurrence of kidnapping event. To check the feasibility of the proposed scheme, the detection accuracy of our newly proposed scheme is compared with that of the previous scheme. According to the experiment results, the proposed scheme could detect kidnapping situations more 4.73% correctly than the previous scheme."

Pegfilgrastim and pegteograstim, which are used for the prevention of FN as a granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), have been granted insurance coverage in the Republic of Korea for certain breast cancer patients using doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) from September 2016.Methods : The data of the patients with breast cancer using AC regimen and G-CSF were collected retrospectively. This study involves cost-utility analysis of pegfilgrastim and pegteograstim. In this study, we constructed a simple decision tree model for short-term observation and calculated qualityadjusted life year (QALY) and the direct medical costs from the medical provider’s perspective.Results : From September 2016 to May 2017, 15 patients were treated with pegfilgrastim and 15 patients were treated with pegteograstim. As a result of dividing the average cost by QALY for each treatment group, it was observed that pegfilgrastim and pegteograstim were consumed 24,923,384 won and 22,808,336 won per 1QALY, respectively. Consequently, incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) showed 2,115,048 won more per pegfilgrastim than pegteograstim per 1QALY, and the cost per 1QALY of both the drugs was lower than 30,500,000 won; the Koreans were willing to pay this amount.Conclusions : This study suggests that pegfilgrastim and pegteograstim can be used to improve the quality of life of breast cancer patients undergoing AC therapy. Among the two drugs, pegteograstim seems to be more cost-effective. However, since this study was conducted as a retrospective observation method on a small scale, it is associated with many limitations. Therefore, a long-term prospective cohort study is needed to supplement the present findings."

Although dynamic fingerprints are damage-sensitive, they are rarely applied to bridges in-situ due to environmental noise. Machine learning techniques can facilitate effective structural damage detection. This paper proposes a detection method based on dynamic fingerprints and machine learning techniques for multi-damage problems in bridges. Vibration analysis is conducted to acquire the dynamic fingerprints, then the Bayesian fusion is used to integrate these features and preliminarily locate the damage. The RSNB method, which combines Rough Set theory and the Naive-Bayes classifier, is introduced as a robust classification tool for damage qualification. A continuous bridge is numerically simulated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The RSNB method is compared with back propagation neural network, support vector machine, and decision tree techniques, it is found that the RSNB outperforms other three methods in terms of transparency, accuracy, efficiency, noise robustness, and stability."

There are few studies on Korean traditional music because of the lack of datasets. This paper analyzes raw audio and MIDI phrases in Korean traditional music, performed using Korean traditional musical instruments. The classified samples and MIDI, based on our classification system, will be used to construct a database or to implement our Kontakt-based instrument library.

Application: The cognitive workload classification model using the ensemble classifier in this study can contribute to the development of a system capable of providing warning signal in real time under pilot""s cognitive overload situation."
A Novel Feature Selection Method in the Categorization of Imbalanced Textual Data,2018,"['Feature selection', 'Imbalanced class', 'High dimensionality', 'Text classification']",,"Text data distribution is often imbalanced. Imbalanced data is one of the challenges in text classification, as it leads to the loss of performance of classifiers. Many studies have been conducted so far in this regard. The proposed solutions are divided into several general categories, include sampling-based and algorithm-based methods. In recent studies, feature selection has also been considered as one of the solutions for the imbalance problem. In this paper, a novel one-sided feature selection known as probabilistic feature selection (PFS) was presented for imbalanced text classification. The PFS is a probabilistic method that is calculated using feature distribution. Compared to the similar methods, the PFS has more parameters. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the feature selection methods including Gini, MI, FAST and DFS were implemented. To assess the proposed method, the decision tree classifications such as C4.5 and Naive Bayes were used. The results of tests on Reuters-21875 and WebKB figures per F-measure suggested that the proposed feature selection has significantly improved the performance of the classifiers."

However, the relationship between these factors and flood damages is yet to be investigated due to the lack of systematic post-disaster surveys. Therefore, we conducted a field survey focused on damaged single family houses and collected data about the factors influencing flood damages. The data was analyzed to evaluate the relationship between various influencing factors and flood damage by using correlation analysis, decision tree model, and random forest method. Through the analyses, the major factors influencing building structure damages were found to be the inundation depth and height of the entrance. Moreover, the inundation depth, debris, and flow velocity were identified as the major factors influencing the building content damages. In the future, it is necessary to explore ways to enhance the resilience of buildings and reduce the influence of major factors by establishing local flood mitigation measures."

The healthcare programs targeting NKDs are required to improve their health outcomes and help reduce health inequalities between NKDs and South Koreans. The objective of this study was to conduct cost-effective analysis of hepatitis A (HAV) vaccination program for NKDs performed by Seoul City in order to make suggestions as to how to manage and expand healthcare programs for NKDs. A cost-effectiveness analysis was carried out, taking into consideration NKDs’ age distribution, HAV immunity, and the prevalence of chronic hepatitis. A decision tree with Markov model was developed and NKDs were allocated to enter the Markov model based on their compliance with antibody test, 1st and 2nd HAV vaccination. In comparison to no vaccination program, HAV vaccination program led to incremental cost of 22,708 won and incremental effectiveness of 0.0005 QALY, resulting in ICER of 45,452,128 won/QALY. The subgroup analysis results indicated that the vaccination program was most cost-effective for those who suffer from chronic hepatitis and have no HAV immunity. In order to develop healthcare programs for NKDs, it would be recommended not only to consider the target population’s characteristics, but also to find the vulnerable subgroups that benefit from the healthcare program and encourage them to comply with the program."
Predicting Employment Earning using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,2018,['소득 예측'],"소득은 경제생활에서 중요하다. 소득을 예측할 수 있으면, 사람들은 음식, 집세와 같은 생활비를 지불 할 수 있는 예산을 세울 수 있을 뿐 아니라, 다른 재화 또는 비상사태를 위한 돈을 별도로 저축 할 수 있다. 또한 소득수준은 은행, 상점 및 서비스 회사에서 마케팅 목적 및 충성도가 높은 고객을 유치하는 데 활용 된다. 이는 소득이 다양한 고객 접점에서 사용되는 중요한 인구 통계 요소이기 때문이다. 따라서 기존 고객 및 잠재 고객에 대한 수입 예측이 필요하다. 이 연구에서는 소득을 예측하기 위해 SVM (Support Vector Machines), Gaussian, 의사 결정 트리, DCNN (Deep Convolutional Neural Networks)과 같은 기계 학습 기법을 사용하였다. 분석 결과 DCNN 방법이 본 연구에서 사용 된 다른 기계 학습 기법에 비해 최적의 결과(88%)를 제공하는 것으로 나타났다. 향후 PCA 같이 데이터 크기를 향상 시킨다면 더 좋은 연구 결과를 제시할 수 있을 것이다.","Income is a vital aspect of economic life.

First of all, geographical distribution of foreign workers vary upon the industrial structure by subregion, Si, Gun, and Gu in Busan.Based on the criteria of foreigner employment and establishment type, we devide firms by 4 categories and explore those characteristics with respect to their practice of foreign worker employment. Firms with foreign workers evaluate that foreign workers tend to be more productive over native non-regular workers, thus pay more to the foreigners. Furthermore, firms hiring foreign workers pay higher wages than firms not hiring foreign. These findings support the view that firms with foreign workers are more profitable and the relationship between native and foreign worker would be complementary each other, boosting productivity of the firm. However, these phenomenon seems to out of the intention of the Work Permit System that allows to hire foreign workers only in certain sectors and firms not being able to find native workers in it. The results of logit and decision tree model to find determinants of firms’ hiring foreign workers revealed that industry, firm size, union and sales volume are the most important variables whether a firm hires foreign worker. Firms in manufacturing sector with higher sales volume and no union tend to hire more foreign workers. However, job vacancies does not seem to have statistical association with firms’ decision to hire foreign workers. In the sense that the Work Permit System in Korea only allow firms with vacancies to hire foreign workers, this is a important check point whether the system works properly.Finally, this paper analyzes whether there are variances in firms’ performances by hiring foreign workers. In order to do so, this paper utilized 1-to-1 matching and PSM together. However, there is no statistically significant differences after controlling firms’ characteristics between firms with and without foreign workers.Based on our results, it would be necessary to find an appropriate policy measure for firms to hire more native workers if the practice of firms’ hiring foreign workers dose not related with their job vacancies and sales volume."

But most earlier studies on the hand gesture interface are using relatively simple hand gestures. In this paper, we classify intuitive and common hand gestures into certain types and present a hand gesture recognition algorithm based on the machine learning to improve the recognition ratio of each hand gesture. First of all, we use Leap Motion to get hand information and then preprocess the hand data to correct the input errors. Next, we classify the data through the binary decision tree and construct the hand feature data. Finally, the input gesture is recognized based on the MCSVM-based machine learning for static gesture and the HMM-based machine learning for dynamic gesture. Experimental results showed an average of 98.6% recognition ratio of 17 kinds of command hand gestures for interaction with a 3D object in a 'Virtual Block' game application. This hand gesture interface can be used as an input interface in various virtual reality application fields such as game, education, medical field, etc. without using mouse or keyboard device."

However, it is difficult for individual investors to obtain and analyze information on public offerings and IPO stocks compared to institutional investors. Therefore, this paper confirms whether individual investors can predict the rise and fall of the IPO’s closing price of offering day compared to its offering price by using multiple data analysis methodologies and non-financial data that is relatively easy to collect, and compares the accuracy of them.

It tries to answer the question “Who leaves comments on online news articles or shares news stories with others?” Commenting on news articles and sharing news stories influence news consumption and society at large, but it is not clear who is leaving the comments and sharing the news. This study differs from previous studies because it applies statistical learning in order to obtain the closest answer to reality, not by making assumptions but by using real data. This paper proposes an optimal model for predicting comment writers and news sharers by applying logistic regression analyses, linear/nonlinear discriminant analyses, decision tree models, random forests, and support vector machines. As a result, we could predict the commenters and the sharers with 99% and 94% accuracy, respectively, using random forests. Furthermore, it is reasonable to consider commenters and news sharers the “leaders of the online news culture” because the groups were identified to be almost identical. They were highly educated, politically liberal or moderate, and active in social activities such as signing campaigns and making donations. In addition, people with a lower amount of trust in national news media tended to write comments and share news, and the more socially influential they regard journalists as being, the more likely they are to share news stories. Finally, the leaders of the online news culture spend a significant amount of time on social networking sites and messaging services. Particularly, news commenters consume or participate in new independent media such as podcasts or YouTube videos, and news sharers actively read news from various media, including social networking sites, messaging services, and political magazines."
