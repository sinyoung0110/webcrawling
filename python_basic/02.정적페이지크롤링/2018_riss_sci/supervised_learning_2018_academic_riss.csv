Semi-supervised Multi-view Manifold Discriminant Intact Space Learning,2018,"['Semi-supervised learning', 'Manifold discriminant intact space', 'Generated multi-view data points', 'Intact feature representations', 'Image classification']",,"Semi-supervised multi-view latent space learning is gaining considerable popularity recently in many machine learning applications due to the high cost and difficulty to obtain the large amount of label information of data. Although some semi-supervised multi-view latent space learning methods have been presented, there is still much space for improvement: 1) How to learn latent discriminant intact feature representations by employing data of multiple views; 2) How to exploit the manifold structure of both labeled and unlabeled point in the learned latent intact space effectively. To address the above issues, we propose an approach called semi-supervised multi-view manifold discriminant intact space learning (SM2DIS) for image classification in this paper. SM2DIS aims to seek a manifold discriminant intact space for data of different views by making use of both the discriminant information of labeled data and the manifold structure of both labeled and unlabeled data. Experimental results on MNIST, COIL-20, Multi-PIE, and Caltech-101 databases demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed approach."
Feature Based Techniques for a Driver's Distraction Detection using Supervised Learning Algorithms based on Fixed Monocular Video Camera,2018,"['Distraction Detection', 'Safety Driving', 'Neural Network', 'Computer Vision', 'Driver Monitoring']",,"Most of the accidents occur due to drowsiness while driving, avoiding road signs and due to driver's distraction. Driver's distraction depends on various factors which include talking with passengers while driving, mood disorder, nervousness, anger, over-excitement, anxiety, loud music, illness, fatigue and different driver’s head rotations due to change in yaw, pitch and roll angle. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, a data set is generated for conducting different experiments on driver’s distraction. Secondly, novel approaches are presented that use features based on facial points; especially the features computed using motion vectors and interpolation to detect a special type of driver’s distraction, i.e., driver’s head rotation due to change in yaw angle. These facial points are detected by Active Shape Model (ASM) and Boosted Regression with Markov Networks (BoRMaN). Various types of classifiers are trained and tested on different frames to decide about a driver's distraction. These approaches are also scale invariant. The results show that the approach that uses the novel ideas of motion vectors and interpolation outperforms other approaches in detection of driver’s head rotation. We are able to achieve a percentage accuracy of 98.45 using Neural Network."
Supervised-Learning-Aided Communication Framework for MIMO Systems With Low-Resolution ADCs,2018,,,"<P>This paper considers a multiple-input multiple-output system with low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). In this system, we propose a novel communication framework that is inspired by supervised learning. The key idea of the proposed framework is to learn the nonlinear input–output system, formed by the concatenation of a wireless channel and a quantization function used at the ADCs for data detection. In this framework, a conventional channel estimation process is replaced by a system learning process, in which the conditional probability mass functions (PMFs) of the nonlinear system are empirically learned by sending the repetitions of all possible data signals as pilot signals. Then, the subsequent data detection process is performed based on the empirical conditional PMFs obtained during the system learning. To reduce both the training overhead and the detection complexity, we also develop a supervised-learning-aided successive-interference-cancellation method. In this method, a data signal vector is divided into two subvectors with reduced dimensions. Then, these two subvectors are successively detected based on the conditional PMFs that are learned using artificial noise signals and an estimated channel. For the case of 1-bit ADCs, we derive an analytical expression for the vector error rate of the proposed framework under perfect channel knowledge at the receiver. Simulations demonstrate the detection error reduction of the proposed framework compared to conventional detection techniques that are based on channel estimation.</P>"

Assessment of delaminated smart composite laminates via system identification and supervised learning,2018,"['System identification', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Smart composite laminates', 'Delamination damage', 'Optimal classifier']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>This paper proposes the synergetic integration of system identification and artificial intelligence for the detection and assessment of delamination damages in smart composite laminates. An electromechanically coupled mathematical model is developed for the healthy and delaminated smart composite laminates on the basis of improved layerwise theory, higher order electric potential field and finite element method. A discriminative feature space is constructed for the healthy and delaminated structures via system identification from their structural vibration responses. The discriminative features are used for the training and cross-validation of various supervised machine learning classifiers and an optimal classifier is identified. The optimal classifier is employed to make predictions on unseen test delamination cases, and its predictions are validated via a dimensionality reduction tool.

Deep Hashing for Semi-supervised Content Based Image Retrieval,2018,"['Semi-supervised deep hashing', 'binary hashing', 'convolutional auto-encoders', 'deep learning', 'image semantics']",,"Content-based image retrieval is an approach used to query images based on their semantics. Semantic based retrieval has its application in all fields including medicine, space, computing etc. Semantically generated binary hash codes can improve content-based image retrieval. These semantic labels / binary hash codes can be generated from unlabeled data using convolutional autoencoders. Proposed approach uses semi-supervised deep hashing with semantic learning and binary code generation by minimizing the objective function. Convolutional autoencoders are basis to extract semantic features due to its property of image generation from low level semantic representations. These representations of images are more effective than simple feature extraction and can preserve better semantic information. Proposed activation and loss functions helped to minimize classification error and produce better hash codes. Most widely used datasets have been used for verification of this approach that outperforms the existing methods."
Deep BBN Learning for Health Assessment toward Decision-Making on Structures under Uncertainties,2018,"['deep learning', 'probabilistic learning', 'deep Bayesian belief network learning', 'structural condition assessment']",,"Structural systems are often exposed to harsh environment, while these environmental factors in turn could degrade the system over time. Their health state and structural conditions are key for structural safety control and decision-making management. Although great efforts have been paid on this field, the high level of variability due to noise and other interferences, and the uncertainties associated with data collection, structural performance and in-service operational environments post great challenges in finding information to assist decision making. The machine learning techniques in recent years have been gaining increasing attentions due to their merits capturing information from statistical representation of events and thus enabling making decision. In this study, the deep Bayesian Belief Network Learning (DBBN) was used to extract structural information and probabilistically determine structural conditions. Different to conventional shallow learning that highly relies on the quality of the hand-crafted features, the deep learning is an end-to-end method to encode the information and interpret vast amount of data with minimizing or no features. A case study was conducted to address the methods for structure under viabilities and uncertainties due to operation, damage and noise interferences. Numerical results revealed that the deep learning exhibits considerably enhanced accuracy for structural diagnostics, as compared to the supervised shallow learning. With predetermined training set, the DBBN could accurately determine the structural health state in terms of damage level, which could dramatically help decision making for further structural retrofit or not. Note that the noise interference could contaminate the data representation and in turn increase the difficulty of the data mining, though the deep learning could reduce the impacts, as compared to conventional shallow learning techniques."
Exploring Factors Hindering Workplace Learning for Clothing Fashion Design Students at One University of Technology in Zimbabwe,2018,"['Workplace Learning', 'Clothing Fashion Design', 'Worker Competencies', 'Barriers', 'Mentor']",,"This study sought to establish factors which hindered learning for Clothing Fashion Design students during workplace learning at one University in Zimbabwe. The study was located in the interpretivist research paradigm, following a qualitative research approach and a descriptive case study design. The research sample was purposively drawn from third-year Clothing Fashion Design students on workplace learning and workplace mentors. In-depth face-to-face individual interviews and document analysis were employed to collect data. The data were analysed thematically. The factors that hindered workplace learning included strikes by mentors, shortage of material resources such as fabrics, under qualified mentors, sexual harassment and improper supervision, financial challenges and inadequacy of time to attend to university academic work. The study concludes that there were some barriers to workplace learning including mentor strikes, shortage of material resources, underqualified mentors, mentor actions, to include sexual abuse, negative attitude by mentors, financial problems, insufficient time and lack of proper supervision.

Deep learning-based sensor fault detection using S-Long Short Term Memory Networks,2018,"['structural health monitoring', 'sensor fault', 'Long Short-Term Memory Networks', 'fault threshold', 'stochastic gradient decline', 'deep learning']",,"A number of sensing techniques have been implemented for detecting defects in civil infrastructures instead of onsite human inspections in structural health monitoring. However, the issue of faults in sensors has not received much attention. This issue may lead to incorrect interpretation of data and false alarms. To overcome these challenges, this article presents a deep learning-based method with a new architecture of Stateful Long Short Term Memory Neural Networks (S-LSTM NN) for detecting sensor fault without going into details of the fault features. As LSTMs are capable of learning data features automatically, and the proposed method works without an accurate mathematical model. The detection of four types of sensor faults are studied in this paper. Non-stationary acceleration responses of a three-span continuous bridge when under operational conditions are studied. A deep network model is applied to the measured bridge data with estimation to detect the sensor fault. Another set of sensor output data is used to supervise the network parameters and backpropagation algorithm to fine tune the parameters to establish a deep self-coding network model. The response residuals between the true value and the predicted value of the deep S-LSTM network was statistically analyzed to determine the fault threshold of sensor. Experimental study with a cable-stayed bridge further indicated that the proposed method is robust in the detection of the sensor fault."
Diagnosis and prediction of periodontally compromised teeth using a deep learning-based convolutional neural network algorithm,2018,"['Artificial intelligence', 'Machine learning', 'Periodontal diseases', 'Supervised machine learning']",,"Purpose: The aim of the current study was to develop a computer-assisted detection system based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm and to evaluate the potential usefulness and accuracy of this system for the diagnosis and prediction of periodontally compromised teeth (PCT). Methods: Combining pretrained deep CNN architecture and a self-trained network, periapical radiographic images were used to determine the optimal CNN algorithm and weights. The diagnostic and predictive accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the ROC curve, confusion matrix, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using our deep CNN algorithm, based on a Keras framework in Python. Results: The periapical radiographic dataset was split into training (n=1,044), validation (n=348), and test (n=348) datasets. With the deep learning algorithm, the diagnostic accuracy for PCT was 81.0% for premolars and 76.7% for molars. Using 64 premolars and 64 molars that were clinically diagnosed as severe PCT, the accuracy of predicting extraction was 82.8% (95% CI, 70.1%–91.2%) for premolars and 73.4% (95% CI, 59.9%–84.0%) for molars. Conclusions: We demonstrated that the deep CNN algorithm was useful for assessing the diagnosis and predictability of PCT. Therefore, with further optimization of the PCT dataset and improvements in the algorithm, a computer-aided detection system can be expected to become an effective and efficient method of diagnosing and predicting PCT."

Binarization of degraded document images based on hierarchical deep supervised network,2018,"['Document image binarization', 'Convolutional neural network', 'Document analysis']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>The binarization of degraded document images is a challenging problem in terms of document analysis. Binarization is a classification process in which intra-image pixels are assigned to either of the two following classes: foreground text and background. Most of the algorithms are constructed on low-level features in an unsupervised manner, and the consequent disenabling of full utilization of input-domain knowledge considerably limits distinguishing of background noises from the foreground. In this paper, a novel supervised-binarization method is proposed, in which a hierarchical deep supervised network (DSN) architecture is learned for the prediction of the text pixels at different feature levels. With higher-level features, the network can differentiate text pixels from background noises, whereby severe degradations that occur in document images can be managed. Alternatively, foreground maps that are predicted at lower-level features present a higher visual quality at the boundary area. Compared with those of traditional algorithms, binary images generated by our architecture have cleaner background and better-preserved strokes.

Deep-Learning Approach for Text Detection Using Fully Convolutional Networks,2018,"['Text Detection', 'FCN', 'Deep Learning', 'Nature Scene Image']",,"Text, as one of the most influential inventions of humanity, has played an important role in human life since ancient times.

Predicting the Relationship between Corporate Financial Information and Credit Rating Using Deep Learning,2018,"['Deep learning', 'Artificial Neural Network', 'Credit Ratings', 'Financial Information', 'Investment Risks', '딥러닝', '인공신경망', '신용등급', '재무정보', '투자위험']",,"One of the best ways by which accounting information users reduce investment risks through corporate information is to predict corporate credit ratings, exactly. Thus, this study would utilize deep learning based on an artificial neural network to predict credit ratings relatively exactly based on the corporate financial information. In other words, this study designed a model for the prediction of credit ratings as a neural network consisting of an input layer, two hidden layers and an output layer and evaluated the model through 10-layer cross-validation.Since most preceding studies analyzing the correlation between corporate financial information and credit ratings presupposed the linearity between explanatory variables and dependent variables, there was a limitation for the model’s reflection of the complex real world. To overcome this limitation, this study presupposed a nonlinear activation function based on an artificial neural network and utilized deep learning based on a deep neural network with the increased number of hidden layers. According to the results of this study, the accuracy of the model for the prediction of credit ratings utilizing deep learning was much higher than the random prediction of credit ratings, and through this, it was proven that utilizing deep learning would be useful in predicting credit ratings.Reducing accounting information users’ investment risks through the accurate prediction of credit ratings allows efficient allocation of resources. In addition, this study would provide useful resources for the supervisory institution that supervises the capital market. In other words, when a supervisory institution prepares a system related to corporate credit ratings by providing an accurate model on corporate financial information affecting corporate credit ratings, the results of this study can be utilized as reference data."
Deep Facial Age Estimation Using Conditional Multitask Learning With Weak Label Expansion,2018,,,"<P>Accurate age estimation from a facial image is quite challenging, since physical age and apparent age can be quite different, and this difference is dependent on gender, ethnicity, and many other factors. Multitask deep learning is one of the approach to improve age estimation by employing auxiliary tasks, such as gender recognition, that are related to the primary task. However, in traditional multitask learning for age estimation, the relationship between the primary and auxiliary tasks is difficult to describe; how the auxiliary tasks enhance the model for the primary objective is ambiguous. In this letter, we propose a conditional multitask learning method that architecturally factorizes an age variable into gender-conditioned age probabilities in a deep neural network. The lack of accurate training labels with discrete age values is another critical limitation to training age estimation models. Therefore, we propose a label expansion method that increases the number of accurate labels from weakly supervised categorical labels. To verify the generality of the proposed method, we perform intensive experiments on the publicly available MORPH-II and FG-NET datasets. The proposed methods outperform state-of-the art methods in both age estimation and gender recognition accuracy. These performance gains are verified on well-known deep network architectures—VGG-16, CASIA-WebFace, and Alexnet—to confirm the proposed methods generality.</P>"
Minimally Supervised Relation Identification from Wikipedia Articles,2018,"['relation identification', 'Wikipedia mining', 'unsupervised clustering']",,"Wikipedia is composed of millions of articles, each of which explains a particular entity with various languages in the real world. Since the articles are contributed and edited by a large population of diverse experts with no specific authority, Wikipedia can be seen as a naturally occurring body of human knowledge. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically identify key entities and relations in Wikipedia articles, which can be used for automatic ontology construction. Compared to previous approaches to entity and relation extraction and/or identification from text, our goal is to capture naturally occurring entities and relations from Wikipedia while minimizing artificiality often introduced at the stages of constructing training and testing data. The titles of the articles and anchored phrases in their text are regarded as entities, and their types are automatically classified with minimal training. We attempt to automatically detect and identify possible relations among the entities based on clustering without training data, as opposed to the relation extraction approach that focuses on improvement of accuracy in selecting one of the several target relations for a given pair of entities. While the relation extraction approach with supervised learning requires a significant amount of annotation efforts for a predefined set of relations, our approach attempts to discover relations as they occur naturally. Unlike other unsupervised relation identification work where evaluation of automatically identified relations is done with the correct relations determined a priori by human judges, we attempted to evaluate appropriateness of the naturally occurring clusters of relations involving person-artifact and person-organization entities and their relation names."

Collecting sufficient labeled data is an expensive and time-consuming task. To build a HAR system in a new environment (i.e., the target domain) with very limited labeled data, it is unfavorable to naively exploit the data or trained classifier model from the existing environment (i.e., the source domain) as it is due to the domain difference. While traditional machine learning approaches are unable to address such distribution mismatch, transfer learning approach leverages the utilization of knowledge from existing well-established source domains that help to build an accurate classifier in the target domain. In this work, we propose a transfer learning approach to create an accurate HAR classifier with very limited data through the multitask neural network. The classifier loss function minimization for source and target domain are treated as two different tasks. The knowledge transfer is performed by simultaneously minimizing the loss function of both tasks using a single neural network model. Furthermore, we utilize the unlabeled data in an unsupervised manner to help the model training. The experiment result shows that the proposed work consistently outperforms existing approaches."

This study proposed four input and output patterns for solar and sunrise prediction. In addition, we predicted solar power generation using the predicted solar and solar radiation data and power generation data of Youngam solar power plant in Jeollanamdo . As a experiment result, the model 4 showed the best prediction results in the sunshine and solar radiation prediction, and the RMSE of sunshine was 1.5 times and the sunshine RMSE was 3 times less than that of model 1. As a experiment result of solar power generation prediction, the best prediction result was obtained for model 4 as well as sunshine and solar radiation, and the RMSE was reduced by 2.7 times less than that of model 1."

Especially, the scale of E-commerce industry in which Amazon and E-bay are standing out is exploding in a large way. As E-commerce grows, Customers could get what they want to buy easily while comparing various products because more products have been registered at online shopping malls.However, a problem has arisen with the growth of E-commerce. As too many products have been registered, it has become difficult for customers to search what they really need in the flood of products.When customers search for desired products with a generalized keyword, too many products have come out as a result. On the contrary, few products have been searched if customers type in details of products because concrete product-attributes have been registered rarely.In this situation, recognizing texts in images automatically with a machine can be a solution. Because bulk of product details are written in catalogs as image format, most of product information are not searched with text inputs in the current text-based searching system. It means if information in images can be converted to text format, customers can search products with product-details, which make them shop more conveniently.There are various existing OCR(Optical Character Recognition) programs which can recognize texts in images. But existing OCR programs are hard to be applied to catalog because they have problems in recognizing texts in certain circumstances, like texts are not big enough or fonts are not consistent.Therefore, this research suggests the way to recognize keywords in catalog with the Deep Learning algorithm which is state of the art in image-recognition area from 2010s. Single Shot Multibox Detector(SSD), which is a credited model for object-detection performance, can be used with structures re-designed to take into account the difference of text from object. But there is an issue that SSD model needs a lot of labeled-train data to be trained, because of the characteristic of deep learning algorithms, that it should be trained by supervised-learning. To collect data, we can try labelling location and classification information to texts in catalog manually. But if data are collected manually, many problems would come up. Some keywords would be missed because human can make mistakes while labelling train data. And it becomes too time-consuming to collect train data considering the scale of data needed or costly if a lot of workers are hired to shorten the time. Furthermore, if some specific keywords are needed to be trained, searching images that have the words would be difficult, as well.To solve the data issue, this research developed a program which create train data automatically. This program can make images which have various keywords and pictures like catalog and save location-information of keywords at the same time. With this program, not only data can be collected efficiently, but also the performance of SSD model becomes better. The SSD model recorded 81.99% of recognition rate with 20,000 data created by the program.Moreover, this research had an efficiency test of SSD model according to data differences to analyze what feature of data exert influence upon the performance of recognizing texts in images. As a result, it is figured out that the number of labeled keywords, the addition of overlapped keyword label, the existence of keywords that is not labeled, the spaces among keywords and the differences of background images are related to the performance of SSD model. This test can lead performance improvement of SSD model or other text-recognizing machine based on deep learning algorithm with high-quality data.SSD model which is re-designed to recognize texts in images and the program developed for creating train data are expected to contribute to improvement of searching system in E-co..."

An Oakeshottian solution to these crises consists of two aspects: one is to reexamine the nature of a university, and the other is to redefine its function and role in higher education. Firstly, the unique nature of a university is that it teaches students how to be a human being by examining and reflecting on their living circumstances. Human beings live in a world of meaning, and learning to understand and express these meanings is a necessary condition for being a man. Secondly, the university can be recognized as a place of conversation where freedom and imagination become the subject of students’ self-examination. Students in a conversation of this kind learn to recognize various voices, to identify their different modes of expression, and to develop the intellectual and moral habits that are suitable for this sort of conversational relationship. Thirdly, we points out the different roles that a university plays in the world of business and the world of liberal learning respectively by analyzing the relationship between university and society. Universities can neither rely too much on either side nor be completely detached from one side. Finally, we understand that what a university gives us is not a way of survival, but some conceptual knowledge about morality and emotion. The knowledge of this sort helps us more comprehensively to understand the world and ourselves. Oakeshott’s concept of a university in modern education plays an irreplaceable role for educational organizations and institutions, especially for parents and teachers, who guide and supervise students foster their moral characters of autocriticism, self-discipline and self-education in the process of liberal learning."

In order to solve this problem, it is necessary to classify information in units of academic papers. However, in Korea, there is no academic database in which such information is provided. In this paper, we propose an automatic classification system that can classify domestic academic literature into multiple classes. To this end, first, academic documents in the technical science field described in Korean were collected and mapped according to class 600 of the DDC by using K-Means clustering technique to construct a learning set capable of multiple classification. As a result of the construction of the training set, 63,915 documents in the Korean technical science field were established except for the values ​​in which metadata does not exist. Using this training set, we implemented and learned the automatic classification engine of academic documents based on deep learning. Experimental results obtained by hand-built experimental set-up showed 78.32% accuracy and 72.45% F1 performance for multiple classification."

Thus it is difficult to know how much they are exposed to crime. If the police can predict the crime risky area, it will be possible to cope with the crime efficiently even though insufficient police and enforcement resources. However, there is no prediction system in Korea and the related researches are very much poor. From these backgrounds, the final goal of this study is to develop an automated crime prediction system. However, for the first step, we build a big data set which consists of local real crime information and urban physicalor non-physical data. Then, we developed a crime prediction model through machine learning method. Finally, we assumed several possible scenarios and calculated the probability of crime and visualized the results in a map so as to increase the people's understanding. Among the factors affecting the crime occurrence revealed in previous and case studies, data was processed in the form of a big data for machine learning: real crime information, weather information (temperature, rainfall, wind speed, humidity, sunshine, insolation, snowfall, cloud cover) and local information (average building coverage, average floor area ratio, average building height, number of buildings, average appraised land value, average area of residential building, average number of ground floor). Among the supervised machine learning algorithms, the decision tree model, the random forest model, and the SVM model, which are known to be powerful and accurate in various fields were utilized to construct crime prevention model. As a result, decision tree model with the lowest RMSE was selected as an optimal prediction model. Based on this model, several scenarios were set for theft and violence cases which are the most frequent in the case city J, and the probability of crime was estimated by 250x250m grid. As a result, we could find that the high crime risky area is occurring in three patterns in case city J. The probability of crime was divided into three classes and visualized in map by 250 x 250m grid. Finally, we could develop a crime prediction model using machine learning algorithm and visualized the crime risky areas in a map which can recalculate the model and visualize the result simultaneously as time and urban conditions change."

This study was conducted to segment and classify road objects using 3D point cloud data acquired by terrestrial mobile mapping system provided by National Geographic Information Institute. For this study, the original 3D point cloud data were pre-processed and a filtering technique was selected to separate the ground and non-ground points. In addition, the road objects corresponding to the lanes, the street lights, the safety fences were initially segmented, and then the objects were classified using the support vector machine which is a kind of machine learning. For the training data for supervised classification, only the geometric elements and the height information using the eigenvalues extracted from the road objects were used. The overall accuracy of the classification results was 87% and the kappa coefficient was 0.795. It is expected that classification accuracy will be increased if various classification items are added not only geometric elements for classifying road objects in the future."

In the modern East Asian history of thought, the beginning of the emergence of subjectivity and the silsim as the main philosophical topic comes from the Neo-Confucianism of Song Dynasty in China. Cheng Yi is the first thinker to emphasize subjectivity and consciousness. Zhu Xi and Wang Yang-ming inherit the Neo-Confucian thought based on Cheng Yi's principle of subjectivity, but only show difference in methodology. In the Chosun Dynasty, Jeong Je-Doo and his School were one example of the Neo-Confucian spirit of subjectivity and the silsim. Although Jeong In-Bo (鄭寅普) belongs to Jeong Je-Doo's school of Ganghwa in the school curriculum, he has only used it methodologically since he believed that Yangming's learning is more effective in the awareness and practice of the silsim. Especially noteworthy is that the principle of subjectivity led Jeong In-Bo to follow the frame of Zhu Xi's moral theory. Jeong's claim that selfish desire (jasasim 自私心) should be controlled by a conscious mind (silsim) being aware of the right and 'ought to do' corresponds to Zhu Xi's view that the moral mind (dosim 道心) should be selected in the conflict situation between sensual desire (insim 人心) and moral consciousness so that the insim should be supervised by the dosim. Such ethics is a position to emphasize the inner motive and the sense of duty of conduct, and there is no fundamental difference in Zhu Xi and Wang Yang-ming. At least on this point, it is necessary to look at modern and contemporary Korean studies from the perspective of continuity, not discontinuity from Confucian tradition."

With its extremely high-level feature extraction capabilities, CNN has been expected to resolve automatic target recognition(ATR) problems. Since the automatic tareget recogntion(ATR) data is military-purpose data, it has a limited amount of labeled data, which is a problem in learning deep CNN. Thus, previous ATR methods have tried to supplement the data using simulated data or other available data. However, most of them are homogeneous sensor data rather than heterogeneous sensor due to distinctly different charateristics even though they have abundant knowledge to train CNN. To address these issues, we propose a transfer learning-based framework that can teach ATR algorithms using heterogeneous sensor data. As verification data of the method, we use unlabeled infrared(IR) data as target data and labeled electro optical(EO) data as source data. The verification results demonstrate that the transfer learning scheme can train IR-ATR CNN to learn sensor invariant features of the target with labeled heterogeneous sensor data i.e. EO, which is not possible with normal supervised learning."

Falls often lead to fatal consequences due to lack of prompt response and rescue. Therefore, a more accurate fall detection system and an effective feature extraction technique are required to prevent and reduce the risk of such incidents. In this paper, we proposed an efficient feature extraction technique based on multiple sliding windows and validated it through a series of experiments using supervised learning algorithms. The experiments were conducted using the public datasets obtained from tri-axial accelerometers. The results depicted that extraction of the feature from adjacent sliding windows led to high accuracy in supervised machine learning-based fall detection. Also, the experiments conducted in this study suggested that the best accuracy can be achieved by keeping the window size as small as 2 seconds. With the kNN classifier and dataset from wearable sensors, the experiments achieved accuracy rates of 94%."

There have been growing concerns that the traditional specialty-based clerkship in fragmented and highly specialized clinical environments may not be the optimal choice for basic clinical education. As a result, a new model of clinical clerkship called longitudinal integrated clerkships (LICs) has emerged. There is increased interest in LICs due to the growing evidence of positive outcomes for students, patients, and supervising clinicians. Emphasizing continuity as one of the main organizing principles of an LIC, this article reviews the introduction of LICs into medical education, the key concepts and educational theories which underpin LICs, and the typology of LICs.

Binary Hashing CNN Features for Action Recognition,2018,"['Action Recognition', 'CNN Feature', 'Binary Hashing', 'Feature Normalization']",,"The purpose of this work is to solve the problem of representing an entire video using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) features for human action recognition. Recently, due to insufficient GPU memory, it has been difficult to take the whole video as the input of the CNN for end-to-end learning. A typical method is to use sampled video frames as inputs and corresponding labels as supervision. One major issue of this popular approach is that the local samples may not contain the information indicated by the global labels and sufficient motion information. To address this issue, we propose a binary hashing method to enhance the local feature extractors. First, we extract the local features and aggregate them into global features using maximum/minimum pooling. Second, we use the binary hashing method to capture the motion features. Finally, we concatenate the hashing features with global features using different normalization methods to train the classifier. Experimental results on the JHMDB and MPII-Cooking datasets show that, for these new local features, binary hashing mapping on the sparsely sampled features led to significant performance improvements."

Also, most of the students with developmental disabilities wanted to work more on their own without support or supervision. In general, the findings indicate that, if students' negative judgment about their own abilities are removed, they can exercise them to the best advantage. Therefore, it is necessary to provide various supports to accomplish them in a lifelong education program."
Hierarchical Cloud Computing Architecture for Context-Aware IoT Services,2018,,,"<P>This paper presents a new cloud computing model for context-aware Internet of Things services. The proposed computing model is hierarchically composed of two layers: a cloud control layer (CCL) and a user control layer (UCL). The CCL manages cloud resource allocation, service scheduling, service profile, and service adaptation policy from a system performance point of view. Meanwhile, the UCL manages end-to-end service connection and service context from a user performance point of view. The proposed model can support nonuniform service binding and its real-time adaptation using meta-objects. Furthermore, it supports intelligent service-context management using a supervised and reinforcement learning-based machine learning framework. We implemented a lightweight prototype of the proposed computing model. Evaluations confirm that the proposed computing model offers enhanced performance compared with legacy uniform computing models.</P>"

At this time, humanity refers to ideal human characteristics oriented in education. The personality education of narrow meaning is the education for human behaviors. At this time, personality means the ideal behavior characteristics. Therefore, if we distinguish the special field of personality education in education, it is close to personality education of narrow meaning. In the top-down direction of personality education, it is an effort to define ideal characteristic of behavior as value and cultivate it. On the other hand, if we look down-up in personality education, it is an effort to cope with behaviors that are contrary to prescribed values. No matter how you approach personality education, it is closely related to moral education which focuses on issues related to behavior. Since moral education is a curriculum that cultivates the core values ​​of humanity through teaching and learning, moral education is a core subject in the character education of top-down approach. And moral education is a curriculum that reflects the behavior problem on the basis of various curriculum learning. Therefore, moral education is the subject of supervision in the personality education of the down-up approach.In this paper, attention is paid to moral education as a supervision of humanity education, and to approach to humanity education from the viewpoint of humanity through reflection. Moral education, which supervise personality education, is intended to cope with the problems that arise from behavior. It has the nature of moral counseling that reflects on its own behavior through moral discourse based on humanistic reason and reflection. We can refer to the ideas of 'Institute for the Advancement of philosophy for children' which developed and practiced to encourage philosophical thinking for children. The moral counseling text that can be used in the moral counseling can be constructed by referring to the teaching manual of philosophy education for children."

This paper proposes a method for classifying human emotions through multiple neural networks based on multi-modal signals which consist of image, landmark, and audio in a wild environment. The proposed method has the following features. First, the learning performance of the image-based network is greatly improved by employing both multi-task learning and semi-supervised learning using the spatio-temporal characteristic of videos. Second, a model for converting 1-dimensional (1D) landmark information of face into two-dimensional (2D) images, is newly proposed, and a CNN-LSTM network based on the model is proposed for better emotion recognition. Third, based on an observation that audio signals are often very effective for specific emotions, we propose an audio deep learning mechanism robust to the specific emotions. Finally, so-called emotion adaptive fusion is applied to enable synergy of multiple networks. The proposed network improves emotion classification performance by appropriately integrating existing supervised learning and semi-supervised learning networks.

Those text data were produced and distributed through various media platforms such as World Wide Web, Internet news feeds, microblog, and social media. However, this enormous amount of easily obtained information is lack of organization. Therefore, this problem has raised the interest of many researchers in order to manage this huge amount of information. Further, this problem also required professionals that are capable of classifying relevant information and hence text classification is introduced. Text classification is a challenging task in modern data analysis, which it needs to assign a text document into one or more predefined categories or classes. In text classification field, there are different kinds of techniques available such as K-Nearest Neighbor, Naïve Bayes Algorithm, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Artificial Neural Network.  However, while dealing with huge amount of text data, model performance and accuracy becomes a challenge. According to the type of words used in the corpus and type of features created for classification, the performance of a text classification model can be varied. Most of the attempts are been made based on proposing a new algorithm or modifying an existing algorithm. This kind of research can be said already reached their certain limitations for further improvements. In this study, aside from proposing a new algorithm or modifying the algorithm, we focus on searching a way to modify the use of data. It is widely known that classifier performance is influenced by the quality of training data upon which this classifier is built. The real world datasets in most of the time contain noise, or in other words noisy data, these can actually affect the decision made by the classifiers built from these data. In this study, we consider that the data from different domains, which is heterogeneous data might have the characteristics of noise which can be utilized in the classification process.  In order to build the classifier, machine learning algorithm is performed based on the assumption that the characteristics of training data and target data are the same or very similar to each other. However, in the case of unstructured data such as text, the features are determined according to the vocabularies included in the document. If the viewpoints of the learning data and target data are different, the features may be appearing different between these two data. In this study, we attempt to improve the classification accuracy by strengthening the robustness of the document classifier through artificially injecting the noise into the process of constructing the document classifier.  With data coming from various kind of sources, these data are likely formatted differently. These cause difficulties for traditional machine learning algorithms because they are not developed to recognize different type of data representation at one time and to put them together in same generalization. Therefore, in order to utilize heterogeneous data in the learning process of document classifier, we apply semi-supervised learning in our study. However, unlabeled data might have the possibility to degrade the performance of the document classifier. Therefore, we further proposed a method called Rule Selection-Based Ensemble Semi-Supervised Learning Algorithm (RSESLA) to select only the documents that contributing to the accuracy improvement of the classifier. RSESLA creates multiple views by manipulating the features using different types of classification models and different types of heterogeneous data. The most confident classification rules will be selected and applied for the final decision making. In this paper, three different types of real-world data sources were used, which are news, twitter and blogs."

However, it is difficult to discriminate sea ice types in optical images using spectral information based machine learning algorithms. This study addresses two topics. First, we propose a semantic segmentation which is a part of the state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to identify ice types by learning hierarchical and spatial features of sea ice. Second, we propose a new approach by combining of semi-supervised and active learning to obtain accurate and meaningful labels from unlabeled or unseen images to improve the performance of supervised classification for multiple images. Therefore, we successfully added new labels from unlabeled data to automatically update the semantic segmentation model.

Research on arousal and valence analysis, which uses images, texts, and physiological signals that employ deep learning, is actively underway; research investigating how to improve the recognition rate is needed. The goal of this research was to design a deep learning framework and model to classify arousal and valence, indicating positive and negative degrees of emotion as high or low. Methods: The proposed arousal and valence classification model to analyze the affective state was tested using data from 40 channels provided by a dataset for emotion analysis using electrocardiography (EEG), physiological, and video signals (the DEAP dataset). Experiments were based on 10 selected featured central and peripheral nervous system data points, using long short-term memory (LSTM) as a deep learning method. Results: The arousal and valence were classified and visualized on a two-dimensional coordinate plane. Profiles were designed depending on the number of hidden layers, nodes, and hyperparameters according to the error rate. The experimental results show an arousal and valence classification model accuracy of 74.65 and 78%, respectively.The proposed model performed better than previous other models. Conclusions: The proposed model appears to be effective in analyzing arousal and valence; specifically, it is expected that affective analysis using physiological signals based on LSTM will be possible without manual feature extraction.

The propagation velocity and direction are calculated by tracing the atmospheric disturbance of each meteo-tsunami event predicted by the WRF model. Then, the Froude number is calculated using the propagation velocity of atmospheric waves and oceanic long waves from bathymetry data. To derive the critical condition for the occurrence of meteo-tsunami, supervised learning using a logistic regression algorithm is conducted. It is concluded that the threshold distance of meteo-tsunami occurrence, from a propagation direction, can be calculated by the amplitude of air-pressure tendency and the resonance factor, which are found using the Froude number. According to the critical condition, the distance increases logarithmically with the ratio of the amplitude of air-pressure tendency and the square of the resonance factor, and meteo-tsunami do not occur when the ratio is less than 5.11 hPa/10 min."

In this paper, we present a novel method for web scale open information extraction, which employs cosine distance based on Google word vector as the confidence score of the extraction. The proposed method is a purely unsupervised learning algorithm without requiring any hand-labeled training data or dependency parse features. We also present the mathematically rigorous proof for the new method with Bayes Inference and Artificial Neural Network theory. It turns out that the proposed algorithm is equivalent to Maximum Likelihood Estimation of the joint probability distribution over the elements of the candidate extraction. The proof itself also theoretically suggests a typical usage of word vector for other NLP tasks. Experiments show that the distance-based method leads to further improvements over the newly presented Open IE systems on three benchmark datasets, in terms of effectiveness and efficiency."

"Two Dimensional Slow Feature Discriminant Analysis via L<sub>2,1</sub> Norm Minimization for Feature Extraction",2018,"['sparse projection', 'slow feature discriminant analysis', 'feature extraction', 'L<sub>2', '1</sub> norm']",,"Slow Feature Discriminant Analysis (SFDA) is a supervised feature extraction method inspired by biological mechanism. In this paper, a novel method called Two Dimensional Slow Feature Discriminant Analysis via L<sub>2,1</sub> norm minimization (2DSFDA-L<sub>2,1</sub>) is proposed. 2DSFDA-L<sub>2,1</sub> integrates L<sub>2,1</sub> norm regularization and 2D statically uncorrelated constraint to extract discriminant feature. First, L<sub>2,1</sub> norm regularization can promote the projection matrix row-sparsity, which makes the feature selection and subspace learning simultaneously. Second, uncorrelated features of minimum redundancy are effective for classification. We define 2D statistically uncorrelated model that each row (or column) are independent. Third, we provide a feasible solution by transforming the proposed L<sub>2,1</sub> nonlinear model into a linear regression type. Additionally, 2DSFDA-L<sub>2,1</sub> is extended to a bilateral projection version called BSFDA-L<sub>2,1</sub>. The advantage of BSFDA-L<sub>2,1</sub> is that an image can be represented with much less coefficients. Experimental results on three face databases demonstrate that the proposed 2DSFDA-L<sub>2,1</sub>/BSFDA-L<sub>2,1</sub> can obtain competitive performance."

As this trend affected the new education in the same period, the education for western sciences was added besides the foreign language education in Tongwen Guan(foreing language college), and various technical schools were set up.Technical schools were built especially to train and rear technical experts for the basic industries of state like ship-building, electric wire, rail road, mine and medical science. The education in the technical school of this period had some important characteristics.First, if though there was diversification in the field of technical education, it was not clearly divided according to military purpose or civilian purpose. Even though one among two purposes was considered more important in a school, the other aim was never excluded completely.Attaching a Rail-road school to Nanjing Military School in 1896, Zhang Zhidong said, A railroad is closely connected not only with the national interest but the military affair of the state., which is a good evidence. Though Northern Medical School(Tianjin Medical School) was primarily a military medical school established for military sake, treatment for civilians was never ignored. It was at first established to cope with military demand in the national emergency, but in reality tended to take care of civilian patients more and more.Technical schools, in fact most of Yangwu schools, had the nature of foreign language school as one outstanding characteristic, as the Front School of Fujian Ship Administration School was called the French School, and the Rear School as The English School. Because proper Chinese words for the modern scientific & technological terms were not established yet and its education had to depend on the western teachers, they should learn foreign languages first. Consequently they preferred the children who had studied western languages in Shanghai, Hongkong and Guangjou for years in technical schools.Though Zhang Zhidong emphasized the Chinese traditional learning as an educational element, it had just the meaning of proclamation, which sometimes impeded the development of Yangwu schools. Most of the schools were financially pressed due to the high wages of western teachers, which as a result hindered the extension and the establishment of Yangwu schools.Another important feature of technical schools was that they supplied for the students not only inhabitation and food but paid living expenses and prize money depending on their achievements in examinations. This policy was a desperate attempt to attract students to overcome peoples' hostility on the western schools. It resulted in the situation that schools were filled with low-levelled poor students aiming at the government supply, which again obstructed the development in long term light. Students were forced extremely restrictive and complex rules and suffered from the oppressive atmosphere of school. Restrictions and incentives were exchanged.The number and scale of technical schools were trivial at first, compared with the size and population of China, but increased and extended gradually. For example, Shanghai Telegraph School started with 20 students in 1882, but the students' number increased to 300 in 1891, which was caused by the increase in the demand for the telegraph. Railroad school started later than telegraph school, which was the reflection of the Chinese peoples' resistance against the construction of railroad.The alumni of Yangwu schools played significant roles for the society as well as made personal success, on the basis of new knowledge and skills in drastically changing China, though they had been looked upon as heretics in the traditional society. Yian Fu(嚴復) who had entered fabrication major in Fujian Ship Administration School as a top talented student among the first term students became the president of Tianjin Navy School, after studying in England Navy School. Shen Yuch'ing(沈瑜慶) and Jiang Chaoying(蔣超英) became the president of Nanjing Navy School later, some others took the president of Guangdong Navy School. Before 1911 Revolution the alumni who majored in fabrication were 143 for 7 terms, those who majored in navigation 241 for 17 terms, and those who majored in engineer 126 for 11 terms. These total 510 alumni made a tremendous contribution to the warship building and the development of the navy in modern China, though at the same time they left a harmful effect on politics by organizing a closed group called Mintang(閩黨)in the bureaucracy. And Tinjin Medical School produced 218 army doctors for 37 years until 1933. Other technical experts who graduated from different technical schools must have opened their new futures on the basis of their knowledge and technologies learned in the school, leaving significant achievements in modern China."

This new and increasingly evolving technology, especially ICT, can not be confident in its effectiveness and safety, so it need to be allowed within the bounds of a pre-determined. In this regard, regulatory sandboxing is a regulatory technique that coincides with the incentives of companies, consumers, and supervisory agencies. Therefore, it is meaningful as an attempt in the field of financial supervision policy to cope with the current rapid changes in information and communication technology.Recently, in Korea, legislation introducing regulated sandboxes has been proposed to the National Assembly. In this paper, I review the system and main contents of the regulation of sandbox in the context of Special Law on Financial Innovation Support. In this paper, I propose some improvements after analyzing and reviewing the contents comparing with the case of foreign countries from the viewpoint of law to increase competition and efficiency between industries and increase the convenience of consumers.First of all, it is the capacity and role of the supervisory authority that is most important in the use of the regulatory sandbox. If the regulatory paradigm shifts from the conventional regulation to the ex-post regulation, the supervision of the administrative supervision agency alone has little effect on the damage of the consumers. Therefore, smart strategic regulatory operation is necessary. In other words, it is desirable to allow actual market launch only in a small scale, and it is desirable to expand the scale to the entire industry by increasing the size of the system, if it is confirmed that the risk is monitored in real time for a certain period of time and the damage prevention device can be quickly detected.Second, through testing, both companies and financial supervisory organization are collecting vivid evidence on regulatory reforms and various information obtained during the test implementation process. The regulatory sandbox allows companies, users, and supervisory agencies to learn from each other, and its effects are very useful for setting and agreeing codes of conduct in today's rapidly changing society.Third, it needs to be complemented by RegTech. As the development of ICT technology, related regulations are likely to be preemptive and complicated for financial consumer protection and supervision enhancement is expected. As it becomes increasingly difficult for regulators to prepare and respond to new risks from new technologies developments, both FinTech and regulatory authorities need to leverage technology in relation to regulation.Finally, it is necessary to prepare measures to prevent and relieve more rapidly in case of the possibility of (mass) consumer disputes due to rapid technological change. For example, it is necessary to consider setting up a victim relief fund."

Immunological Recognition by Artificial Neural Networks,2018,"['T-cell receptor diversity', 'Immunological recognition', 'Artificial neural networks']",,"The binding anity between the T-cell receptors (TCRs) and antigenic peptides mainly deter- mines immunological recognition. It is not a trivial task that T cells identify the digital sequences of peptide amino acids by simply relying on the integrated binding anity between TCRs and antigenic peptides. To address this problem, we examine whether the anity-based discrimination of peptide sequences is learnable and generalizable by artificial neural networks (ANNs) that pro- cess the digital experimental amino acid sequence information of receptors and peptides. A pair of TCR and peptide sequences correspond to the input for ANNs, while the success or failure of the immunological recognition correspond to the output. The output is obtained by both theoretical model and experimental data. In either case, we confirmed that ANNs could learn the immuno- logical recognition. We also found that a homogenized encoding of amino acid sequence was more effective for the supervised learning task."
자율화의 관점에서 현행 인정교과서 제도에 대한 비판적 고찰,2018,"['Approved textbooks', 'Textbook screening', 'Textbooks', 'Autonomy', 'Curriculum', '인정교과서', '인정도서', '교과서 제도', '자율화', '교육과정']","우리나라에서 교육과정 및 교과서와 관련하여 자율화의 가치를 계속적으로 추구해온 정책적 방향을 고려하면서, 인정교과서 제도를 정리하고, 국정 및 검정교과서와의 차이점과 공통점을 분석하여, 인정교과서 제도가 교육의 자율성을 확보하는 데 있어 갖는 한계를 분석하는 것이 본 연구의 목적이다. 따라서 인정교과서 제도를 자율화라는 관점을 중심으로 논증의 방식에 따라 분석하고자 하였다. 이를 위해 첫째, 교육에 있어 자율화 방향이 교과서에 대한 인식 및 제도 변화에 어떤 영향을 미쳤는지 살펴보고, 둘째, 자율화와 인정교과서 제도의 관련성을 살펴본 후, 마지막으로 쟁점을 중심으로 인정교과서 제도가 자율화에 기여하였는지 분석하였다. 인정교과서의 지위가 국·검정교과서보다 낮게 정해져 있다는 점, 인정교과서의 심사도 여전히 까다롭게 진행된다는 점, 감수라는 별도의 과정이 도입되었다는 점, 심사의 주체가 시·도교육청으로 바뀌었을 뿐 여전히 중앙·지방 정부의 간섭이 심하다는 점, 그리고 헌법에 보장된 학생의 학습권을 위배했다는 점 등에 의거하여 인정교과서 제도는 자율화에 기여하지 못했다고 결론내릴 수 있다. 현재 자유발행제가 논의되고 있다. 2013년 한국사 교과서 파동, 박근혜 정부의 한국사에 대한 국정교과서 추진 등으로 말미암은 반작용과 현 정부의 정치적 성향에 힘입은 일시적 현상일 수도 있지만, 정치적 논리를 떠나서 학교현장의 가장 특수하고도 미시적인 상황에서 활용되는 교과서에 관한 권한을 학교현장에 돌려준다는 점에서 의미 있다고 할 수 있다. 교사 전문성 확보라는 전제조건이 확실하게 마련된다면, 학교현장의 최전선에 있는 교수·학습자료인 교과서에 대해서는 관련 권한을 조금씩 학교현장에 이양할 필요가 있을 것이다.","The purpose of this study is to analyze whether the approved textbook system was a system suitable for achieving autonomy in the educational field, considering the policy direction that has pursued the value of autonomy in textbooks, which is one of the tools of curriculum management. Therefore, I tried to analyze the system of approved textbooks according to the method of argument based on the viewpoint of autonomy. First, I examined how the direction of autonomy in education affected the perception of textbooks and institutional change. Second, I examined the relevance of the autonomy and the approved textbook system. Finally, I analyzed whether the approved textbook system contributed to the autonomy in the educational field. The analyzed issues are as follows. First, the status of approved textbooks is lower than that of national textbooks. Secondly, screening of approved textbooks is still difficult. Third, a separate process of supervision was introduced. Fourth, the subject of the screening was changed from the central government to the local government, and still the intervention of central and local governments was severe. Fifth, the approved textbook system violated the student's right to learn under the Constitution. Based on this point, it can be concluded that the approved textbook system did not contribute to the autonomy in the educational field. It is necessary to return all autonomy for textbooks, which are teaching and learning materials at the forefront of the school scene, to the school site."
A Study on Effects of Mentoring Education Program by Advisor onto Adaptation and Relationship of University Freshmen,2018,"['University Freshmen', 'Mentoring Education', 'Adaptation to a University', 'Policies on Educational Welfare & Educational Innovation']",,"The identity of each university is threatened due to severe changes in the university entrance exam environment including a low birthrate and an increase in the drop-out rate by the students maladaptive to their majors. Accordingly, in this study, the effects of the mentoring program which was implemented during a semester targeting the university freshmen were examined and analyzed in order for the students to establish each identity as an adult and to enhance their adaptation ability to the university environment.Based from the results of the study, most of the freshmen showed very positive responses regarding some enhancement of the levels of the satisfaction with some academic courses, a help for the adaptation to the university life, a help for their understanding of each major course, some enhancement of their prides in the university, some enhancement of their interests in studying, some enhancement of the levels of closeness with each classmate and some enhancement of the learning atmosphere, etc. This study emphasized the formation of useful relationship between a mentoring program and the supervision to university freshmen. An advisor, as a mentor, will participate in the program as part of the curriculum to help freshmen adapt to the university environment. Therefore, this study is intended to suggest some baseline data for preparing for various kinds of policies on educational welfare and proposals on educational innovation in order for the future Korean university freshmen."

The ban on Korean contents brought on by Terminal High Altitude Area Defense(THAAD) left lessons of reflection and awakening in Korea and China. This research analyzed synchronically regulation on Chinese cultural industry taking the opportunity of ban on Korean contents. Was there any regulation on Korean cultural industry before the ban on Korean Culture in Korea from now? In addition this paper analyzed the flow and direction of policy and regulatory measure in cultural industry of Chinese government before and after the ban on Korean contents in China surrounding research theme of 'Was there no regulation on Chinese cultural industry?'.In conclusion, Chinese government is strongly regulating overall cultural industry. It has regulated all the cultural contents of overseas as well as Korean cultural contents and its own cultural industry is more strictly regulated. Its point is in that Chinese government is effectively manage and supervise cultural industry. This basis is not limited to cultural industry but is Chinese government's policy and orientation. As shown in 19th National Peoples' Congress of the Communist Party of China in October, 2017 and Double Congress in March, 2018. Xi Jin-ping government cracks down on the internal through anti-corruption action and is making China strong by establishing Sole Ruling System. Regulation on journal and media integrating newspaper and publication into Central Propaganda Department has been strengthened and in particular legal system to regulate all the company home and abroad for ICT area based on Internet has been established through <Internet Safety Law>.Taking an opportunity of THAAD, China put the brake on spreading Korean cultural industry. Whenever political issues has occurred on the Korean Peninsula, cultural industry surrounding Korean Wave is highly likely to be hit first. After learning lessons from this ban on Korean contents, we need to establish action while strengthening essence and durability of Chinese cultural industry. That is the lesson of the ban on Korean cultural contents."
Subclassification and Detection of New Markers for the Discrimination of Primary Liver Tumors by Gene Expression Analysis Using Oligonucleotide Arrays,2018,"['Cholangiocarcinoma', 'Carcinoma', 'hepatocellular', 'Oligonucleotide arrays', 'Gene expression analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry']",,"Background/Aims: The failure to correctly differentiate between intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a significant clinical problem, particularly in terms of the different treatment goals for both cancers. In this study a specific gene expression profile to discriminate these two subgroups of liver cancer was established and potential diagnostic markers for clinical use were analyzed. Methods: To evaluate the gene expression profiles of HCC and intrahepatic CC, Oligonucleotide arrays (AffymetrixU133A) were used. Overexpressed genes were checked for their potential use as new markers for discrimination and their expression values were validated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry analyses. Results: 695 genes/expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in HCC (245 up-/450 down-regulated) and 552 genes/ ESTs in CC (221 up-/331 down-regulated) were significantly dysregulated (p< 0.05, fold change >2, ≥70%). Using a supervised learning method, and one-way analysis of variance a specific 270-gene expression profile that enabled rapid, reproducible differentiation between both tumors and nonmalignant liver tissues was established. A panel of 12 genes (e.g., HSP90β, ERG1, GPC3, TKT, ACLY, and NME1 for HCC; SPT2, T4S3, CNX43, TTD1, HBD01 for CC) were detected and partly described for the first time as potential discrimination markers. Conclusions: A specific gene expression profile for discrimination of primary liver cancer was identified and potential marker genes with feasible clinical impact were described.

The increase of its diplomatic activities led to more foreign affairs, which were organized and developed by its diplomatic office, the Hong Ryeo Department(鴻臚).The scope of diplomatic affairs in the Hong Ryeo Department of the Tang Dynasty was so extensive and detailed that it organized and hosted polo sports games from Persia.It served a series of diplomatic functions that the current Foreign Ministry officials in charge of foreign envoys have, including the protocol for the reception and escorting of foreign envoys, distinguishing country-specific ranks of the arriving foreign envoys, receiving and delivering diplomatic documents submitted by the foreign envoys, manners at an imperial reception, receiving of tribute, hosting a banquet, managing guest house and food, treating diseases among foreign envoys, funeral rituals, arranging and supervising activities for the foreign envoys, interpreting and translating, and acquiring foreign information.Historical materials regarding the Hong Ryeo Department of the Tang Dynasty confirm that the diplomatic functions of the Hong Ryeo Department were equally applied to its neighboring countries such as Koguryo(高句麗), Baekje(百濟), Silla(新羅), Wa (倭國), Japan(日本), Balhae(渤海), Tibet(吐蕃), Kyrgyzstan(堅昆), Turkic(突厥), and Uighur(回紇). In particular, it should be noted that the diplomatic relations between the Tang Dynasty and its neighbors progressed on a reciprocal and equal footing. However, some recent Chinese studies have not interpreted Koguryo as an independent country.In this paper, I present some diplomacy and protocol examples of the Hong Ryeo Department that were implemented in its neighboring countries. Subsequently, I emphasize on their implementation in Koguryo during the Han-Tang period, just as they were implemented in other neighboring countries.In the process, I discovered that Koguryeo also had a government official equivalent to the Hong Ryeo Department of the Tang Dynasty, called Balgochuga(拔古鄒加), which was in charge of the diplomatic affairs regarding the Tang envoys. I also learned about the existence of a special guest house for the diplomatic envoys of Koguryeo and of an ancient interpreter named Tongsha(通事), who interpreted in diplomatic scenes between Koguryeo and the Tang Dynasty. Furthermore, I found a case that demonstrates that the Tang Dynasty had a special respect for Koguryeo compared to other countries.These examples will serve as a useful basis for reaffirming the internationality of the relationship between Koguryeo and the Tang Dynasty."

사회네트워크분석을 통한 시니어 기술창업교육참여자들의 네트워크 활성화 사례 연구,2018,"['니어기술창업교육', '사회네트워크', '네트워크 중심성', '전략적 제휴', 'Senior technology start-up education', 'Social network', 'Network centrality', 'Strategic alliance']","본 연구의 목적은 정부의 주도하에 진행되고 있는 시니어 대상 창업교육과정 참가자들의 교육 전‧후 사회네트워크 분석을 통해 네트워크 활성화를 위한 창업교육 프로그램의 필요성을 제시함에 있다. 본 연구는 경남 G대학에서 주관한 시니어기술창업교육을 수료한 대상자 60명을 선발하여 교육 전‧후 친밀도를 분석하고, 참여자들간의 전략적 제휴 정도를 포함하는 관계변화를 분석하였다. 경남 G대학의 시니어기술창업교육은 기술교육과 더불어 참여자 네트워크 형성에 초점을 두어 액션러닝을 기반한 교육을 기획, 진행한 특징을 가지고 있다. 본 연구는 대상자들 간의 관계에 대해 설문(있다/없다)을 진행하고, 데이터를 수집 및 정제하여 사회네트워크 중심성을 분석하였다. 네트워크 중심성은 네트워크 내 영향력을 분석할 수 있는 요소이다. 중심성이 높다는 것은 네트워크 내에서 업무와 관련한 영향력과 명성도가 높다는 것과 의사결정 과정에 중요한 영향을 미친다는 것을 의미한다. 구체적으로 본 연구는 첫째, 사회네트워크 분석을 통해 교육전과 교육후 친밀도 기반 네트워크 변화를 분석하고 통계적으로 그 의미를 해석하였다. 둘째, 창업교육 수료생이라는 대상의 특성을 고려하여 창업단계에서 네트워크 내의 참여자 간에 이루 어질 수 있는 전략적 제휴 정도를 분석하였다. 셋째, 전략적 제휴를 기반으로 분석한 자료에서 네트워크 중심성이 높은 대상자들을 추출하여 인터뷰를 진행하였다. 인터뷰를 통해 추가적으로 확보한 구체적 사례로 서베이 연구를 보완하였다. 연구 결과, 친밀도 기반 네트워크의 변화는 통계적으로 유의미했으며, 인터뷰 결과, 농업기반 창업의 초기단계에서 이루어질 수 있는 전략적 제휴 사례를 확인할 수 있었다. 전략적 제휴 네트워크에서 중심성이 높은 참여자들은 모두 경남 G대학의 시니어기술창업스쿨 교육과정 중 형성된 네트워크를 창업단계에서 절대적으로 필요한 무형자산으로 생각할 뿐만 아니라 네트워크의 중요성을 인지하고 있었다. 본 연구결과는 시니어를 위한 창업교육프로그램 설계와 창업활성화를 위한 전략의 설계 방향으로 유용하게 활용될 것으로 기대한다. 마지막으로 본 연구의 한계점과 향후 연구방향을 논의하였다.","The purpose of this study is to present the necessity of entrepreneurship education program for network activation through analyzing pre - and post - social networks of the participants in senior technology start-up education. We selected 60 people who completed the senior technology start-up education which was supervised at Gyeongnam G university, analyzing not only density (intimacy) before and after education but also the change in the relationship including the degree of strategic alliances among the participants. Senior start-up education at Gyeongnam G University is characterized by action learning focusing on the formation of network among participants as well as technical education. We conducted the questionnaires on the relationship with the subjects’ answers of yes or no, gathered and refined the data, analyzing the social network centrality. Network centrality measures the degree of influence in the network. The high centrality means that it has a significant influence on the decision making process, and that the influence and reputation associated with work in the network are also high. Specifically, we first analyzed the change of intimacy-based network before and after education through social network analysis. Secondly, we analyzed the degree of strategic partnership (alliances) that can be carried out among participants in the network at the start-up stage. Thirdly, in the data analyzed on the strategic alliance, we selected to interview the people of high network centrality. We complemented the analyses and results of survey data with the concrete examples of interviews. As the result of survey data analyses, changes in intimacy-based network were statistically significant, while we were able to confirm the cases of strategic alliances that can be done in the early stages of farm foundation by the interviews. All participants of high centrality in the strategic alliances network regarded the network formed in the senior technology start-up education program as an absolutely necessary intangible asset at the inception stage, recognizing the importance of the network. The results would imply the desirable directions for designing the start-up education program for seniors as well as the strategy of activating start-ups. Lastly, we discussed the limitations and future research directions."
