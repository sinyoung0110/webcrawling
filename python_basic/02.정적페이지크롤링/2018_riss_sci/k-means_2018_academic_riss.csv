암호화된 데이터에 대한 프라이버시를 보존하는 k-means 클러스터링 기법,2018,"['Privacy-preserving clustering', 'Fully homomorphic encryption', 'k-means clustering']",k-means 클러스터링 알고리즘은 주어진 데이터를 비슷한 k개의 그룹으로 묶어서 시장 세분화나 의료연구 등의다양한 분야에서 활용되고 있다. 본 논문에서는 다수의 사용자 데이터를 노출하지 않고 암호화하여 외부 서버에 저장하는 환경에서 프라이버시를 보존하는 클러스터링 알고리즘을 제안한다. 분산된 서버에 평문으로 저장된 데이터를다자간 계산프로토콜을 기반으로 수행된 기존 클러스터링 알고리즘 연구와 비교했을 때 제안하는 기법은 모든 데이터를 안전하게 암호문으로 저장할 수 있다는 뚜렷한 장점이 있다. 데이터 간의 거리를 측정하고 비교하기 위해서 덧셈과 곱셈 연산이 가능한 완전동형암호로 데이터를 암호화한다. 프로토콜 수행과정에서 사용자 데이터의 안전성을분석하고 통신량과 연산량을 다른 연구들과 비교한다.,"The k-means clustering algorithm groups input data with the number of groups represented by variable k. In fact, thisalgorithm is particularly useful in market segmentation and medical research, suggesting its wide applicability. In this paper,we propose a privacy-preserving clustering algorithm that is appropriate for outsourced encrypted data, while exposing noinformation about the input data itself. Notably, our proposed model facilitates encryption of all data, which is a largeadvantage over existing privacy-preserving clustering algorithms which rely on multi-party computation over plaintext datastored on several servers. Our approach compares homomorphically encrypted ciphertexts to measure the distance betweeninput data. Finally, we theoretically prove that our scheme guarantees the security of input data during computation, and alsoevaluate our communication and computation complexity in detail."

Rao. et. al. proposed a k-Means clustering algorithm that supports the protection of information by using a paillier crypto system. However, since the algorithm selects initial center points randomly, the result of clustering is irregular. Because it uses a comparison operator based on bit arrays, it has a disadvantage in that its computation cost greatly increases in proportion to the size of the array. To solve this problem, we propose an efficient k-Means clustering algorithm that supports the protection of information. To do this, we propose a cryptographic operation protocol that compares encrypted data. In addition, we performs efficient clustering by selecting initial center points in terms of the entire data distribution.

The partial discharge data Information is preliminarily processed through simulation using an Epoxy Mica Coupling sensor and an internal Phase Resolved Partial Discharge Analysis algorithm. The obtained information is processed according to the characteristics of the pattern using a Motor Insulation Monitoring System program. At this time, the processed data are total 4 types that void discharge, corona discharge, surface discharge and slot discharge. The partial discharge data with high dimensional input variables are secondarily processed by principal component analysis method and reduced with keeping the characteristics of pattern as low dimensional input variables. And therefore, the pattern classifier processing speed exhibits improved effects. In addition, in the process of extracting the partial discharge data through the MIMS program, the magnitude of amplitude is divided into the maximum value and the average value, and two pattern characteristics are set and compared and analyzed. In the first half of the proposed partial discharge pattern classifier, the input and hidden layers are classified by using the K-means clustering method and the output of the hidden layer is obtained. In the latter part, the cross entropy error function is used for parameter learning between the hidden layer and the output layer. The final output layer is output as a normalized probability value between 0 and 1 using the softmax function. The advantage of using the softmax function is that it allows access and application of multiple class problems and stochastic interpretation. First of all, there is an advantage that one output value affects the remaining output value and its accompanying learning is accelerated. Also, to solve the overfitting problem, L2-normalization is applied. To prove the superiority of the proposed pattern classifier, we compare and analyze the classification rate with conventional radial basis function neural networks."

Incremental basis estimation adopting global k-means algorithm for NMF-based noise reduction,2018,"['Nonnegative matrix factorization', 'Basis training', 'Incremental approach', 'Global k-means', 'Source separation']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a data decomposition technique enabling to discover meaningful latent nonnegative components. Since, however, the objective function of NMF is non-convex, the performance of the source separation can degrade when the iterative update of the basis matrix in the training procedure is stuck to a poor local minimum. In most of the previous studies, the whole basis matrix for a specific source is iteratively updated to minimize a certain objective function with random initialization although a few approaches have been proposed for the systematic initialization of the basis matrix such as the singular value decomposition and k-means clustering. In this paper, we propose an approach to robust bases estimation in which an incremental strategy is adopted. Based on an analogy between clustering and NMF analysis, we estimate the NMF bases in a similar way to the global k-means algorithm popular in the data clustering area. Experiments on audio separation from noise showed that the proposed methods outperformed the conventional NMF technique using random initialization by about 2.04dB and 2.34dB in signal-to-distortion ratio when the target source was speech and violin, respectively.</P>"

The results of this paper indicate that 227 customers were segmented into VIPs among 1866 customers. And according to 51,080 transactions data of VIPs, home product and women wear are frequently associated with food, which means that the purchase of home product or women wears mainly affect the purchase of food.

Therefore, recording the amount of winter snowfall and preparing for a sudden disaster became another homework to cope with the global warming. Since Korea has traditionally not suffered by heavy snow damage, the number of snow observation stations is smaller than that of rainfall observation stations. Therefore, it is necessary to install additional snow observation stations, but before this, the current distribution of snow observation stations should be analyzed. Monthly maximum fresh daily snow depth and observational altitude data of January, February, and December were used as the four parameters of K-mean algorithm. Total 94 snowfall stations were classified by data retention period and cluster analysis was performed. As a result of the cluster analysis, a cluster was formed into four: the west coast area, the inland mountainous area along the Taebeek - Sobaek mountain vein, Gyeongsang and South coast, and Jeju island, Ulleungdo and Daegwallyeong. In addition, since the snow observation station in Jeju Island is only installed on the coastal area, additional snow observation stations should be considered in the mountainous area."

First, we examine the relationship between analyst coverage and accounting conservatism, and then examine whether K-IFRS adoption has a significant effect on the relationship between analyst coverage and accounting conservatism. Conservatism is measured by the method of Ball and Shivakumar (2008) and Khan and Watts (2009). Analyst coverage is measured as the total number of analysts who issue earnings forecasts and the natural logarithm after adding 1 to the number of analysts who issue earnings forecasts.The most significant changes in the adoption of K-IFRS are the principle-based standard framework, introduction of consolidated financial statements as basic financial statements, and the expansion of fair value. This suggests that there will be a change in environment of analysts and accounting conservatism of managers due to characteristic accounting environment change.Introduction of consolidated financial statements as basic financial statements and the principle-based standard framework are expected to cause additional costs to analysts who need to interpret additional information, and the increase in the annotation disclosure due to the principle-based framework and the expansion of the fair value are expected to improve the information environment by providing additional information to the analyst. Meanwhile, in the K-IFRS ‘conceptual framework for financial reporting’, the word ‘conservatism’ has been replaced by ‘prudence’, but from 2012, it has been removed from the qualitative characteristics of accounting information. Accordingly, the adoption of K-IFRS will reduce the bias of underestimation of net assets by showing the fair value of the economic condition of firms (Joyong et al., 2014). In addition, accounting conservatism is expected to decrease due to the characteristics of K-IFRS, which emphasizes relevance rather than a faithful representation of information.Our study is meaningful in that it examines whether the analysts fully understand the change of accounting environment and perform the forecasting activities, and whether those appropriate monitor the change of accounting conservatism of the forecasting company. Thus, we examine whether financial analysts accept the decline in accounting conservatism due to the adoption of K-IFRS and apply them appropriately to the forecasting activities of the firms.The empirical results of our study are as follows. First, there is a significant positive (+) association between analyst coverage and accounting conservatism. This means that firms adopt more conservative accounting when they are followed by more analysts than when they are followed by fewer analysts. These results are consistent with domestic and foreign studies that examined the association between analyst coverage and accounting conservatism in the pre-K-IFRS period (Sun and Liu 2011; Oh et al., 2013). Second, the adoption of K-IFRS has a significant negative (-) effect on the association between analyst coverage and accounting conservatism. This indicates that analysts are well aware of the changes in the accounting environment caused by the adoption of K-IFRS, and are used appropriately in forecasting for firms. In addition, these findings suggest that high analyst coverage may lead to high accounting conservatism if analyst coverage serves as a corporate governance role.Our study contributes to the literature in the following ways.

The Korean Idols also have positive effects on Korean culture. They spread new wave of korean culture activities to the international world. For instance, growing numbers of the international fans have interested in learning korean language to understand K-pop culture. Their musics can connect fans around the world and make people share ideas and messages. In this respect, understanding the impacts of the contemporary designs related to K-pop culture is important as a means of communication platform. So the K-pop fans are leading a new world of fandom and creating new design trends in terms of the symbolic aspects. This Study, in these respect, investigates a graphic symbol of K-pop boy and girl groups in the age of new korean wave. K-pop has been impacted on the music industry, dance, performance and fashion field, also on the fandom as well. Moreover, K-pop spread not only among korean, but also out toward the abroad growing as an international symbolic icon. Now, the South Korean idol groups 3.0 more actively communicate with fans around the world using social network system than idol groups 1.0-2.0 in 1990s. The purpose of this study is to interpret the Graphic symbols of Idols in Modular system and applied to the symbols in the aspect of the design culture."

This means that the company may overestimate DTA, which may result in a different valuation for the DTA. Therefore, this study aimed at verifying the value relevance of DTA after applying K－IFRS. for this purpose First, this study examined the effect of DTA on stock prices. Second, we investigated the effect of realization of DTA on stock prices. The analysis period and the sample target were 1,605 companies that are registered in the securities market(in December from 2014 to 2016) and the value relevance was verified using the Ohlson(1995) model.The results of this paper are summarized as follows. First, DTA had a positive(＋) impact on share prices. Second, DTA showed differentiated value relevance depending on the feasibility. Empirical results means that DTA are still being valued as positive information in the capital market even after the recognition standards of DTA have been relaxed. also this study suggests that investors value the deferred tax assets recognized by the corporation differently according to their feasibility, without trusting them. Our findings contribute to the validation of the value relevance of DTA in a relaxed recognition standard environment after K－IFRS."

Rahner’s argues that the divine nature of human beings is transcendent, therefore any human being is an anonymous christian. In this article, Rahner has examined the phenomenon of divine phenomena claimed by Rahner.The transcendence of divinity tells humans that human beings have become human beings to cultivate and transcend their uniqueness. Because of this transcendence, human transcendence is beyond historical circumstances. It is not left as a separate part of life and is involved in historical circumcision.Historically, it's called the ‘transcendental Experience.’ The relationship between the sexes refers to the status of a human being in a way that can relate to God. Because God is a part of the ‘Self-sufficiency’ that God gave to humans, God is a human nature. Based on the divine nature, you can't fully understand the God’s, but you can’t fully understand God.There’s a relationship that can be found and figured out. It has a relationship that can’t be separated from human beings.Transcendental existence, it’s a human existence. Beyond death, it means that you’re already connected to God, and if you don’t have a connection with God, the divine nature of a transcendent nature should not be sustainable.The persistence of divinity is meaningful and persistent, and it is divine. It appears as a metaphor for God who wants to maintain relationships with humans and interact with humans.And as a persistence, divine identity is God. It is self-transmitting and self-sufficient."

The results of this study are expected to serve as a basis for the creation and operation of a college curriculum of vocational key competencies and as a guide to career development for the graduates. To achieve the purpose of the study, ten vocational key competencies were chosen as research variables, and hypotheses were formulated accordingly. The research hypotheses were tested using empirical data collected from 384 graduates of K College in Gyeonggi-do (204 of them are currently employed) in February 2018. The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS and MS Excel software packages. Research findings indicated that occupational ethics, interpersonal ability, and self-development ability were among the competencies seen as the most important in both the employed and unemployed groups. On the other hand, information and technology abilities were ranked lower in both groups. The employed group was found to be superior to the unemployed group with regards to ten vocational key competencies. The difference in the means of vocational key competencies between the two groups was statistically significant for mathematical ability, problem solving ability, self-development ability, organizational understanding ability, and interpersonal ability. However, information ability, communication ability, technical ability, resource management ability, and professional ethics were not statistically significant. The findings of this study are expected to be a cornerstone of the research on the relationship between vocational key competencies and employment as a performance measure. Furthermore, it will contribute to the expansion of the horizon and opportunities in the research on vocational key competencies. Our research results imply that it is imminent to overcome the limitations of the existing curriculum through an innovative liberal education program which is suited to the changes in the environment.

Although previous studies have focused on male K-pop stars as the object of heterosexual desire, the phenomenon of “fan cosplay,” or “fancos” for short, demonstrates that these male stars also serve as a means for cross-gender identification for female fans. This paper explores K-pop’s role as a space for its young female fans to explore gender and sexual identity, as well as its influence on local queer subculture in terms of gendered styling, gendered pairing, and queer terminology. Furthermore, an examination of the historical changes in the popularity of fancos reveals the transformation in the recognition of homosexuality and its backlash in Korea as well as the strategies of the queer subculture to focus on invisibility and in-group differentiation. Therefore, a queer perspective on K-pop studies includes domestic queer fans in the study of K-pop, complicates the heteronormative assumptions of fandom studies, and the relationship between commercial media and desire and sheds light on sexual politics in South Korea."

Honorifics are far different from polite languages. While the polite languages have their wide scope and amplitude including the interactions between symmetrical and asymmetrical roles, the honorifics are mainly used among asymmetric roles. It is possible to assert that honorifics are indispensable in Koreans’ polite communication and so that they are considered as a means of communication and an intrinsic part of the communication strategies. In Korean polite communication, therefore, the communication roles should focus on honorifics and their expressive ways in order to achieve the most effective communication."

Specifically, our concern is to examine hypertension suspicious (prehypertension) patients who might develop their symptoms to established hypertension in the future. The proposed method uses fuzzy C-means clustering as quantization engine with careful seeding of the number of clusters from histogram analysis. The experiment verifies that the proposed method is feasible in that the successful extraction rates are 96% (successful in 48 out of 50 test cases) and demonstrated better performance than K-means based method in specificity and sensitivity analysis but the proposed method should be further refined as the retrospective analysis pointed out."

We have been thinking about the limitation of oral history arising from the fact that it is written and used by letters. In order to overcome this limitation, we conducted an experimental class in which we produced a verbatim theatre play that combined oral history and play. It was a class specifically on conducting interviews with descendants of Korean independence activists and making a play based on these interviews. The interviewees were the descendants of Kim Kyu-sik, Yun Bong-gil, Lee Hoe-yeong, Jung Jeong-hwa and Jo So-ang. Five history students and ten theatre students attended the class. They were divided into five groups. Each group consisted of one history student and two theatre students. The groups explored the life of an independence activist, interviewed with his or her descendant, and made a script for a 10-minute play. And they themselves performed the play on stage. The interviewees attended the performance and shared the meaning of the play which represented their voices with the students and audiences. This work has been highly successful in the following respects. First, it is not only possible but also effective to deliver oral history not by letters but by oral representation. Second, the verbatim theatre which uses transcripts of oral history interviews could be a very useful and effective means of overcoming the alienation of interviewees and honoring their lives with many audiences. Third, the performance of oral history could be effectively linked to the accumulation of interview data. Fourth, the link between oral history and education could achieve positive effects not only on history education but also on social education, practical education, emotional education and communication between generations."

Honorifics are far different from polite languages. While the polite languages have their wide scope and amplitude including the interactions between symmetrical and asymmetrical roles, the honorifics are mainly used among asymmetric roles. It is possible to assert that honorifics are indispensable in Koreans’ polite communication and so that they are considered as a means of communication and an intrinsic part of the communication strategies. In Korean polite communication, therefore, the communication roles should focus on honorifics and their expressive ways in order to achieve the most effective communication."

Second, consideration is given to the characteristics of the logistics industry and the development. Third, I would like to look at ways to revitalize the logistics industry. Fourth, we want to derive implications for the research results. As a result of this study, the following results provide implications: First, if you look at the problems at the national level, you can see problems such as poor laws and systems of third-party logistics, insufficient global logistics laws, and delayed integration of global standardization. Second, the method of professional logistics services and the level of management management of logistics companies are insufficient. The Chinese logistics industry is rapidly developing, but the size of Chinese logistics companies is smaller than that of developed countries, and the recognition and quality of services are lower. Third, service methods and means are relatively simple, and high-dimensional logistics services have yet to be fully opened. Fourth, the organization of logistics companies is very small and lacks the necessary functions in competition. Fifth, the difficulty of integrating logistics management and the traditional and regional limitations should be pursued in a competitive and open logistics market economy."
Stable Ferroelectric Behavior of Nb-Modified Bi0.5K0.5TiO3-Bi(Mg0.5Ti0.5)O3 Lead-Free Relaxor Ferroelectric Ceramics,2018,,,"<P>Crystal structure, dielectric, ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and electric field-induced strain properties of lead-free Nb-modified 0.96Bi(0.5)K(0.5)TiO(3)-0.04Bi(Mg0.5Ti0.5)O-3 (BKT-BMT) piezoelectric ceramics were investigated. Crystal structure analysis showed a gradual phase transition from tetragonal to pseudocubic phase with increasing Nb content. The optimal piezoelectric property of small-signal d (33) was enhanced up to similar to 68 pC/N with a lower coercive field (E (c)) of similar to 22 kV/cm and an improved remnant polarization (P (r)) of similar to 13 mu C/cm(2) for x = 0.020. A relaxor-like behavior with a frequency-dependent Curie temperature T (m) was observed, and a high T (m) around 320A degrees C was obtained in the investigated system. This study suggests that the ferroelectric properties of BKT-BMT was significantly improved by means of Nb substitution. The possible shift of depolarization temperature T (d) toward high temperature T (m) may have triggered the spontaneous relaxor to ferroelectric phase transition with long-range ferroelectric order without any traces of a nonergodic relaxor state in contradiction with Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-based systems. The possible enhancement in ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties near the critical composition x = 0.020 may be attributed to the increased anharmonicity of lattice vibrations which may facilitate the observed phase transition from a low-symmetry tetragonal to a high-symmetry cubic phase with a decrease in the lattice anisotropy of an undoped sample. This highly flexible (at a unit cell level) narrow compositional range triggers the enhancement of d (33) and P (r) values.</P>"

Each of them has the exclusion of others respectively through apoha’s function, namely, the exclusion of non‐blue things and that of non‐lotuses. A question arises: How could the exclusion of non‐blue things and that of non‐lotuses be identical with the same object which consist in exclusively two kinds of exclusion; how could the two different words establish the relation of qualifier-qualificand and that of co‐referentiality? To resolve these difficulties, Dignāga discusses in PS(V) 5.14 that the exclusion of non‐blue things and that of non‐lotuses are different from each other, because the non‐blue things and the non‐loutses, which are what is to be excluded, are different from each other. Two different words with different meanings can thus have be established such relations by his original theory.Conclusionally, in PS(V) 5.36d Dignāga argues that his apoha theory is superior to (guṇotkarṣāt) other schools’ tadvat theory because of non-existence of four mistakes (doṣa) on word’s meaning (śabdārtha), and therefore a word could denote things exclusively as qualified by the exclusion of others (arthāntaranivṛttiviśiṣṭān)."

Most K-pop fans, like other popular culture fans, enjoy photographing or filming their favorite musicians. Some fans, taking high quality pictures of K-pop stars with professional cameras, share these photos through their own websites, also known as “homes.” These fans, commonly nicknamed as “hommas,” and their photography are widely recognized in fandom as many other fans visit the homes to appreciate and download the good photos. However, hommas are frequently stigmatized just as paparazzi both within and outside of fandomsince they followK-pop stars’ everymove at every corner─ranging fromthe stars’ live performances at concert halls to their arrival and departure at airports─to shoot more photographs. The first objective of this paper is to challenge this negative bias against hommas. For this objective, the paper first describes how K-pop fans engage in not only shooting but also producing and consuming fan merchandise in addition to the consumption of K-pop official goods produced and sold by K-pop labels. This paper also demonstrates howthese photograph-related fan practices especially at homes can shape a form of various cultures and/or subcultures in the K-pop scene. The paper then claims that a K-pop fan’s home functions as a “blackmarket,” an alternativemarket outside of officially certified producers or sellers, as well as that a homma serves as an inclusive cultural producer embracing a photographer, editor, webmaster, seller, supporter, and investor in K-pop fandom."

This study investigated the psychometric properties of the Korean version of the Adult Playfulness Trait Scale(K-APTS; Shen, Chick, & Zinn, 2014a), a new measurement of playfulness that assesses an individual’s disposition for uninhibitedness and spontaneous fun. A total of 540 college students  participated in the survey. Confirmative factor analyses(CFA) and multiple-group CFA in M-plus 7.4, was used for the verification of construct validity, the Pearson correlation coefficients in SPSS 23.0  was used for the verification of criteria validity and Cronbach’s ɑ in SPSS 23.0  was used for the verification of reliability. The three-level construct of K-APTS was confirmed. The 19 items of K-APTS were explained by five clearly interpretable factors: fun belief, initiative, reactivity, fun belief, initiative, and reactivity. High-order factor analyses confirmed the underlying hierarchical model of K-APTS that comprises three additional sub-dimensions: fun-seeking motivation, uninhibitedness, and spontaneity, wherein fun-seeking motivation includes three sub-dimensions: fun belief, initiative, and reactivity. In third order model, one overarching construct supports the interpretation of a general “playfulness” factor underlying all subscales. Evidence of criteria validity was obtained from correlations of the K-APTS with the K-PSA. The three-level construct of K-APTS demonstrated good internal consistency. Greater playfulness in the K-APTS was associated positively with extraversion, openness to new experiences, agreeability, conscientiousness, it was negatively associated with neuroticism in K-BFI. The multi-group CFA was conducted to compare male and female samples. Given the configural invariance, the metric invariance and partial scalar invariance were held across multiple groups. The latent mean analysis examined whether the mean level of latent construct was invariant across groups.

Methods: After completing the final translation through verification, to verify the tool’s reliability and validity, 218 senior drivers, aged 65 plus, were assessed through translated versions of Drivers 65 plus, K-DBQ and MoCA-K. Results: The translated version was completed after verification of translation and reverse translation, participant comprehensibility, and suitability; no questions were deleted or added. In reliability testing of the translated version of Drivers 65 plus, the internal reliability of the items was Cronbach’s α=0.575, and test-retest reliability was .95 by ICC. In the confirmatory factor analysis to verify construct validity, the model fit indices were as follows: NC=2.954, CFI=.806, TLI=.736, NFI=.742 and RMSEA=.095. K-Drivers 65 plus and K-DBQ had a significant positive correlation(r=.470, p<.01) while there was a significant negative correlation with MoCA-K(r=-.495, p<.01). When we tested the usefulness of the K-Drivers 65 plus to assess driving suitability in senior drivers, the AUC (.726) was confirmed to have normal accuracy in selecting suitability. K-Driver 65 plus distinguished those with a total score of 31 or more as Risk drivers and those with scores of less than 31 as Safe drivers. Conclusion: Although K-Drivers 65 did not show high reliability and validity in this study, it was proven to be an adequate self-assessment tool for two reasons: 1) it can be easily provided to a large number of elderly drivers and 2) it is possible to prevent accidents by predicting driving suitability based on the results."

The first is abolished by the realization of philosophy. The second is abolished by the transformation of philosophy into the social theory. The third, philosophy is abolished when it survives as formal logic or dialectical logic. However, he criticizes these points of the view and makes his Marxism into humanistic Marxism by capturing the activities of the human subject in the philosophy of the practice. It defines the position of the human beings in the world and contributes to clarifying the moments of the practice in the human being as a meaning of the labour and the existence. Human beings are defined not by the totality pseudo-wholeness or fiction but by concrete totality. In order to grasp the true reality, we have to combine the concrete totality with the dialectics that pursue the things themselves. Furthermore, through the dialectical thinking, the human being can orient themselves toward an the open world through the practice, not only as the sum of the processes of the relations and facts, but also as the structures, occurrences, and totals.Eventually, such practice is established when the man is defined through the totality of the world revealed in the history."

Most of the studies have focused on case analysis of MOOC or development and operation strategies from a perspective of instructors since it’s on early stage. However, understanding students should take a precedence in order for a sustained growth of K-MOOC and it is not sufficiently accomplished with survey or quantitative research. This study attempts to explore the process and essence of learners’ experience in K-MOOC, which is difficult to achieve by positivism approach. We recruited a total number of 17 participants through criterion sampling and snowball sampling. The participants were interviewed 1:1 and recorded data were transcribed. The data were analyzed using Colazzi’s phenomenological method and resulted in 2 categories, 8 theme clusters, and 19 themes. The findings are as follow: For learners’ experience process, participants demonstrated 1) low level of awareness and expectation, 2) freedom with no burden, 3) little achievement and satisfaction. 4) lack of learner support & quality control, and 5)expectations of differentiated online courses. With regard to learners’ meaning, participants expressed 1) expansion of thoughts and get out of a man of narrow view, 2) self-regulated and mature learning experiences, and 3) foundation for continuous learning for adults. Based on the findings, we suggested implication for instructors and administrators at K-MOOC."

Five validation metrics are used to obtain an overalland quantitative evaluation of the performance of SST k-ω models: the fractional bias (FB), the geometric meanbias (MG), the normalized mean square errors (NMSE), the geometric variance (VG), and the factor of 2 of theobservations (FAC2). The results of vertical concentration profile and longitudinal surface concentration of the1:1:2 building illustrate the reasonable performance for all five metrics. However, the lateral concentration profileat X = 3H (where X is the distance from the source) shows poor performance for all of the metrics with theexception of NMSE, and the lateral concentration profile at X = 10H shows poor performance for FB and MG."

The oldest age of 562 ± 2 Ma among three reported K-Ar ages in the schist led to the claim that the depositional period of the lowermost Jangsan Formation in the Joseon Supergroup is late Neoproterozoic. Its depositional age is important for understanding the tectonic evolution of the Korean Peninsula including the formation and evolution histories of its sedimentary basins. Thus, the reliability and geological meaning of three K-Ar ages in the original paper (Yun, 1983) were revisited in the review. Quartz grains in the analyzed sample contain a considerable amount of excess Ar, and therefore it is inappropriate to use the ages as a basis for a depositional age constraint of the Jangsan Formation. The timing of mylonitization in the schist is recalculated as ~170 Ma."

SPATIALLY VARYING SMALL-STRAIN STIFFNESS IN SOILS SUBJECTED TO K0 LOADING,2018,"['spatial variability', 'effective stiffness', 'K0 coefficient', 'uniaxial compaction', 'zero-lateral strain loading']",,"Grain-scale characteristics and formation history determine spatial variability in granular masses. We investigate the effect ofspatially varying stiffness on the load-deformation response under zero-lateral strain conditions using numerical simulations ofcorrelated random fields, where the granular medium is represented by a non-linear stress-dependent meso-scale model. Resultsshow that stiffness heterogeneity results in higher global compressibility as compared to the homogeneous medium with the samearithmetic mean stiffness. Furthermore, the non-homogeneous stress field that develops inside the granular mass is characterized byfocused load transfer along columnar regions, higher stress anisotropy and lower horizontal-to-vertical stress ratio K0 than in agranular medium of homogenous stiffness. As the applied stress increases, the inherent stress-dependent response of the granularmaterial leads to a more homogenous stress field. While greater variance in stiffness causes lower global stiffness, a longercorrelation length results in greater variance in global mechanical response among multiple realizations."

Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted on the data of 252 adults (Mean age=34.83, SD=7.6) to check factorial validation. After 10 items that cross-loaded onto two factors were removed, three factors of 22 items were confirmed. Based on the EFA, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted on the data of 253 adults (Mean age=34.12, SD=8.5) to test the stability and generalization of the factor structure.The original Inventory had two subscales: “fear of humiliation” (F1), and “cumulative humiliation” (F2). When a third factor, “humiliation of incompetence” (F3), was added to K-HI, the model fit (TLI=.90, CFI=.91, RMSEA=.09) was better than that of the two-factor model. This result may reflect cultural distinctiveness. Korea is a highly competitive society,-; therefore, “fear of humiliation” and “humiliation of incompetence” may have different meanings among the Korean people. Also, K-HI exhibited appropriate concurrent validity. It correlated with Internalized Shame positively and with Rosenberg’s Self-Esteem negatively. Assuming that humiliation correlates with anger and aggression, correlation analyses were carried out with the State-Trait Anger Expression. They showed significantly positive correlations and demonstrated the clinical utility of K-HI.Cronbach’s αs of the three factors were good (F1=.96, F2=.94, F3=.81). K-HI is expected to be used in the studies of other themes, such as anger, aggression, depression, suicide, and psychotherapy.”"

With the difference of the titles, the translations of the two shows a considerable problematic difference at the beginning part about the first verse. In suggesting the claims of outside-realist that ""the ālambana of cognition (e.g., a visual) is an external object"", Xuanzang described the five types of consciousness, while Paramārtha described the six types of consciousness. This difference is due to Paramārtha’s assumption that it is necessary to dispute all the six objects of cognition including mental consciousness, while Xuanzang assumed it enough to dispute the five objects of cognition.When we look at the translations of the commentary by Dharmapāla, while Yijing interpreted that it includes the fivefold assembly of consciousness in the Guan suoyuan lunshi (觀所緣論釋), Vinītadeva interpreted that it subsumes the mind (意), including eyes and ears and so on, in the Ālambanaparīkṣāṭīkā. There is some difference in interpretations between the line of ‘Xuanzang-Yijing’ explaining with the five kinds of consciousness and the line of ‘Paramārtha-Vinītadeva’ explainig with the six kinds of consciousness.Nevertheless, we can notice that the problem of the mind consciousness is not completely excluded from the interpretation of the former. The reason for omitting the mind consciousness was that it is not ‘consistent like one [一向]’ such as the previous five kinds of consciousness (前五識). For the mental consciousness perceived both the ultimate existence and conventional existence. Therefore, the meaning of the commentary that “the mental consciousness is not treated with a trouble”, should be interpreted to involve a kind of mental consciousness naturally, but it was too burdensome to discuss.And we can find that the position of Dignāga about the two conditions of cognition in the first verse has the purpose to refute the two conditions suggested by the Sautrāntika. The external object are not able to meet both conditions of cognition. Dignāga's intention only borrows their logic to point out that the two conditions are the cause of the wrong view. Rather than the two conditions correspond with the inside part of cognition, that is to say the grasped part, namely ālambana (所緣), Dignāga's original intention as a Yogācāra philosopher can be noticed from the point of refuting the two conditions. Therefore, we should not overlook the fact that his motive, which seems to accept the two conditions of cognition, was to borrow the logic intentionally in order to dispute the Sautrāntika."

The results of an exploratory and a confirmatory factor analysis supported that the LCS-K has one factor consisted of 6 items. The internal consistency of the LCS-K was good. Internal and external work values were used to test convergent and discriminant validities. The LCS-K was found to have stronger correlations with the internal values such as work meaning than adequate compensation. According to the results of criterion-related and incremental validity, work volition significantly predicted living a calling. Additionally, living a calling explained significant additional variance of career commitment, burnout, withdrawal intention, life meaning, and life satisfaction even when the effect of perceiving a calling was controlled. Ultimately, the LCS-K is considered as a valid measurement for Korean adult employees. Implications for career education and future research were discussed."

Feedback Design for Multi-Antenna <tex> $K$</tex>-Tier Heterogeneous Downlink Cellular Networks,2018,,,"<P>We characterize the ergodic spectral efficiency of a non-cooperative and a cooperative type of <TEX>$K$</TEX>-tier heterogeneous network with limited feedback. In the non-cooperative case, a multi-antenna base station (BS) serves a single-antenna user using maximum-ratio transmission based on limited feedback. In the cooperative case, a BS coordination set is formed by using dynamic clustering across the tiers, wherein the intra-cluster interference is mitigated by using multi cell zero-forcing also based on limited feedback. Modeling the network based on stochastic geometry, we derive analytical expressions for the ergodic spectral efficiency as a function of the system parameters. Leveraging the obtained expressions, we formulate feedback partition problems and obtain solutions to improve the ergodic spectral efficiency. Simulations show the spectral efficiency improvement by using the obtained feedback partitions. Our major findings are as follows: 1) in the non-cooperative case, the feedback is only useful in a particular tier if the mean interference is small enough; 2) in the cooperative case, allocating more feedback to stronger intra-cluster BSs is efficient; and 3) in both cases, the obtained solutions do not change depending on the instantaneous signal-to-interference ratio.</P>"
Validation of the Korean Version of the Quality of Life–Cancer Survivors (QOL-CS-K) Questionnaire in Lymphoma Survivors,2018,"['Survival', 'Quality of life', 'Lymphoma', 'Validation studies']",,"Purpose The objective of this study was to validate the Korean version of the Quality of Life–Cancer Survivors (QOL-CS-K) in a sample of lymphoma survivors.Materials and Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey of lymphoma survivors who had survived for at least 24 months since diagnosis. Participants were recruited at the outpatient clinics and at a hospital event in a tertiary hospital in Seoul, Korea. Survivors were asked to complete the QOLCS- K and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) questionnaires. To determine test-retest reliability, a second questionnaire was sent to participants who completed the first questionnaire adequately.Exploratory factor analysis and Pearson’s correlations were used for evaluating reliability and validity of the QOL-CS-K.Results Among 257 survivors, 245 (95.3%) completed all questionnaires and had no missing data.The mean age of study participants was 52.2 years, 54.9% were men, and the mean time since diagnosis was 4.0±1.6 years. The Cronbach’s # for the overall QOL-CS-K was 0.90, and the # coefficients for each subscale ranged from 0.73 to 0.83. The test and retest reliability was 0.88. Moderate correlations were found between comparable subscales of the QOL-CS-K and subscales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 (r=0.51-0.55) except for the spiritual well-being subscale of the QOL-CS-K, which did not correlate with any of the EORTC QLQC30 subscales (–0.08 to 0.16).Conclusion The QOL-CS-K is a reliable and valid scale for measuring the QOL in long-term lymphoma survivors."

PAR K Formula Can Replace “Guide to Medical Certificate” Published by Korean Medical Association in Deciding the Treatment Duration,2018,"['Treatment duration', 'Casualty medical certificate', 'Abbreviated injury scale', 'Formula', 'Korean Medical Association']",,"Purpose: Many doctors have difficulty in deciding the treatment duration in trauma patients to write in the casualty medical certificate. We tried to find a solution for this problem by using abbreviated injury scale (AIS).Methods: A total of 39 patients treated in our regional trauma center who requested an author to write treatment duration on casualty medical certificate from January 2014 to April 2017 were included. And the treatment duration was decided based on the PARK Formula (AIS). PARK Formula (AIS)=(AIS×2) ~ ([AIS×2]+2)Results: Among 39 patients included and 36 (92.3%) had treatment duration on casualty medical certificate within the range of treatment duration calculated by PARK Formula (AIS). Compared to the PARK Formula (AIS), the mean value was 0.13 week (0.90 day) smaller. Comparing the treatment duration between Korean Medical Association (KMA) guideline and PARK Formula (AIS), only 22 patients (56.4%) showed agreement. The mean value was 1.02 week (7.18 days) smaller in KMA guideline.Conclusions: For the decision of the treatment duration in trauma patients, utilizing worldwide used AIS scoring system is very efficient. Using PARK Formula (AIS), doctors can document the treatment duration in the casualty medical certificate with ease. KMA should provide more practical ‘treatment duration of each diagnosis in writing casualty medial certificate’ for the doctors. We recommend PARK Formula (AIS) as a good alternative for KMA guide."

As a result of the analysis, the three-factor structure similar to the factor structure of the original scale, the factors 1 and 3 were constructed similar to the factor structure of the original scale. However, in Factor 2, the items of Factor 3 of the original scale and the further developed items were grouped together, confirming that Korean patriarchal culture constitutes one factor with patriarchal beliefs in the micro scale of the original scale. In addition, the three sub-factors were conceptualized as male influence in public domain(11-items), family culture centered on paternity(10-items), and perception of female inferiority(9-items). In a main study for over 18 male and female adults(N=300), confirmatory factor analysis and validity analysis of the factor structure of the final scale were conducted and the mean difference between the sub-factors was tested according to gender and age. As a result of the study, the good fit of the three-factor model of final scale was confirmed and the internal consistency showed high reliability of .94 ~ .96. In the mean difference test according to sex and age, it was found that the male had higher patriarchal beliefs than the female and the older age was higher.

Morphological descriptors showed significant diversity among cultivars; on morphological cluster analysis, the cultivars 9 and 7 were more related, while cultivars 10 and 3 were distinct. Fifty accessions (5 from each cultivar) were characterized using a DNA-based molecular marker, ISSR. In all, 108 amplification products were generated with 17 ISSR primers, 6.35 fragments with an average \per primer. Out of these, 83 were found to be polymorphic with an overall percentage polymorphism of 75.2%. Total genetic diversity (Ht) and the mean genetic diversity estimated within populations (HS) was 0.2613 and 0.0803, respectively. Gene flow (Nm) and Coefficient of gene differentiation (Gst) among the cultivars was 0.2220 and 0.6926, respectively. Nei’s genetic diversity index (H) and (I) were the lowest for cultivar 10 (H = 0.037; I = 0.056) and the highest for cultivar 8 (H = 0.121; I = 0.176). Analysis of molecular variance revealed 35% within group and 65% among group genetic diversity. Based on cluster analysis, cultivar 10 appeared distinct from rest of the cultivars. The high genetic diversity detected in the present study can be utilized in maize breeding programs, wherein the elite genotypes could be crossed with the existing cultivars to form novel gene and trait combinations."

Thus, complex data can be easily classified, but the amount of learning computation and memory increases due to increase of the number of weights. Deep learning, which requires a lot of computation and memory, usually is trained on cloud environments. However, the cloud environment must be maintained in good communication state with user and have burden on service cost and risk of leakage of personal information. To solve this problem, deep learning needs to be learnt on the embedded device, and be light-weighting. Pruning and quantization methods are widely used for the light-weighting. Existing quantization methods usually use K-means, one of the unsupervised learning methods, in order to determine representative values of clustering weights. In the K-means method, the number of groups is set through trial-and-error method, which results in the computation overhead. To alleviate the overhead, we propose an instant weight quantization method using statistical information of weights Also, it can improve learning performance by quantizing sequentially with considering the dependency between layers in the network."

Enterprises that are supported by policies should have a high potential for future growth. That is, these policies should be supported by enterprises that are capable of sustainable growth. In order to find a start-up enterprise capable of sustainable growth, information of SMEs having a structure similar to a start-up enterprise can be used. In this paper, we conduct enterprise clustering using k-means cluster analysis and t-SNE for start-up enterprises and SMEs that have been provided with technology-based start-up enterprises and SMEs support programs at Daejeon Center for Creative Economy & Innovation in South Korea. The clustering of companies using k-means cluster analysis is performed, and the enterprise information is learned by t-SNE and projected in a two-dimensional space to confirm the characteristics of each cluster. As a result of applying the experiment to 169 start-up enterprises and SMEs, we found clusters of start-up enterprises with high growth potential."

An onsite survey of visitors to Daebu Haesol 1 gil, Gyeonggi Province, was conducted from late November 2016 to early January 2017. An exploratory factor analysis and K-means cluster analysis were employed to identify market segments by using data collected from 434 respondents. The results showed three distinct segments labelled ‘Nature Seeking Responsible Tourists’, ‘Passive Nature Seeking Tourists’ and ‘Nature/Cohesion Seeking Responsible Tourists.’ All three segments had different levels of ‘escape’, ‘health’ and ‘cohesion’ motivations but commonly they all had a relatively high level of ‘nature’ motivation. As they also differed from each other in terms of sociodemographic and travel related characteristics as well as satisfaction level, it was concluded that motivation and attitudes of responsibility can be used for ecotourism market segmentation. A significant implication is that this research confirmed that the indicators on tourists’ attitude of responsibility toward local communities are useful in segmenting visitors to ecotourism sites, which have been rarely studied in previous ecotourism market studies."
百濟 遷都 地名 ‘枳慕蜜地’와 俗地名 ‘모질매’,2018,"['variation ([*ki]~[*kʌ]~[*ko])(枳~支~只)', 'variation ([*mo]~[*ma]~[*mʌ])(慕~牟~馬)', 'meaning of different transcriptions 枳慕~支牟~只馬~古馬(large', 'big', 'great', '大', '雄)', 'allophone 固麻/格們', 'meaning of 格們(도회지', '대도시', '대처', '서울', '首都)', 'synonym(密地~彌知~彌里~彌離)', 'general meaning of 枳慕密地(large city', 'great village', '大邑', '雄邑).', '枳慕蜜地(大邑‧雄邑)', '枳慕~支牟~只馬~古馬(大‧雄)의 이표기', '固麻(格們의 전음', '도회지', '서울', '首都)', '蜜地~彌知~彌里~彌離', '密地(邑)의 이음동의성', '[k]와 [ʧ]의 인지적 유사성.']","‘枳慕蜜地’에서의 ‘枳(~支~只)’는 [*ki]~[*kʌ]~[*ko]의 변이 관계를 나타내고, ‘慕(~牟~馬)’는 [*mo]~[*ma]~[*mʌ]의 변이 관계를 나타내므로 ‘枳慕~支牟~只馬~古馬’ 등은 이표기임을 알 수 있다. 그런데 다음 기록은 ‘馬’를 ‘古馬’와 대응시키고 있다. 馬邑縣 本百濟古馬彌知縣 景德王改名 今遂寧縣(삼국사기 권36 잡지5 지리3). 위의 ‘馬’는 訓을 차용한 것이고, ‘古馬’는 音을 차용한 것이다. ‘馬邑’은 ‘大邑, 雄邑’을 의미하므로 ‘古馬’의 의미는 ‘大, 雄’과 같게 된다. 이로 미루어 ‘古馬~只馬~枳慕~支牟’ 등의 의미도 ‘大, 雄’으로 추론할 수 있다. 또한 중국측 사서에는 ‘固麻’를 ‘格們’의 전음으로 본다. ‘격문(格們)’이란 ‘도회지(대도시, 대처)’ 또는 ‘서울’ 즉 수도(首都)를 가리키는 것으로 ‘固麻’를 비롯해서 ‘枳慕~支牟~只馬~古馬’ 등은 ‘大’의 의미를 갖는다.‘枳慕蜜地’의 후행 요소 ‘蜜(密)地’는 [*mʌlj-ti]로 재구할 수 있다. 이때 [lj]가 모음화하면 [*mʌj-ti]가 되므로 ‘蜜地’는 ‘彌知[*mʌj-ti]’와 동음성을 보인다. 이것은 고대국어 한자음에서 ‘未, 米, 彌’ 등의 한자음이 중세국어와 같은 [mi/미]가 아니라 [mʌj/ᄆᆡ], [mɨj/믜], [məj/메], [maj/매] 등에 가까운 音(김무림 2015: 116-8)이었다는 것을 의미하는 것이다. 또한 ‘知, 地, 遲, 至’의 고대국어 한자음은 모두 [ti/디]로 재구할 수 있다. [l/ㄹ]이 지닌 [+continuantclassic] 자질이 후행 모음의 자질과 이화를 일으키면 [t/ㄷ]으로 변해 ‘彌里[*mʌj-li/ᄆᆡ리]’는 ‘彌知[*mʌj-ti/ᄆᆡ디]’로 변하게 된다. 그리하여 ‘蜜(密)地~彌知~彌里~彌離’ 등은 이음동의어 관계를 이룬다. 아울러 현대국어의 潮水名에서 ‘한매-한물, 두매-두물, 세매-세물’(도수희 2005: 176) 등과 같이 북방인 어청도에서는 ‘-매’이고, 남방인 흑산도에서는 ‘-물’인 점도 ‘買, 未, 米, 彌’와 ‘勿, 蜜(密)’의 고대 음가 및 관련성을 보여주는 실례가 된다. 馬邑縣 本百濟古馬彌知縣에서 ‘彌知’가 ‘邑’으로 개칭되었음을 알 수 있다. 즉, ‘邑 = 彌知~蜜(密)地~彌里~彌離~密’이 된다. ‘彌里 鄕之小者’(遼史 卷116)라 한 것을 보면, ‘枳慕蜜地’의 일반적인 의미는 ‘大邑, 雄邑’이 된다. 시대에 따라 聚落의 규모가 커지거나 작아져 의미가 확장되면 首都, 城, 村(일어 mura), 要塞 등의 의미도 가지게 되었을 것이다.‘枳慕蜜’과 속지명 ‘모질매’의 음운론적 관련성은 첫째, 어두 음절에서의 도치 현상을 들 수 있다. 왜냐하면 고지명 표기에서의 도치(臨津縣 本高句麗津臨城 景德王改名 今因之(三國史記 地理 二) 현상은 흔히 볼 수 있기 때문이다(도수희 1975: 61). 두 번째는 ‘-蜜(密)’과 ‘-매’의 음운론적 관련성이다. ‘-蜜(密)’의 고대 한자음은 [*mʌlj]([*ᄆᆞᆯ])~[*mʌj]([*ᄆᆡ])로 재구되며, 그 의미는 ‘邑’으로 추정되었다. 따라서 ‘枳慕+蜜/慕枳+蜜’의 구성을 이루어 ‘大+邑’의 의미를 갖는다. 세 번째는 k-구개음화와 관련된 것이다. 전설 고모음 앞의 연구개 파열음이 동일 환경의 경구개-치경 파찰음과 음향적으로 유사해서 청자들이 쉽게 혼동한다는 사실(Guion 1998)은 밝혀진 바 있다. 연구개음의 구개음화는 단일한 음 변화에 있어서 조음적 요인 및 음향적·인지적 요인이 모두 중요하다는 사실을 보여 준다(박종희‧권병로 2011). [ʧ]와 비슷한 스펙트럼 정점의 진동수를 가지는 전설 고모음 앞의 [k]는 인지적으로 [ʧ]와  ...","‘枳慕密地’ was the well known place name where the King Mu of Paek Je Dynasty had trnsferred the Capital from PuYeo. In this paper I would like to investigate the phonetic value of the several Chinese characters in the Old Korean relating with this place name. In general ‘枳(~只~支)’ represented the variants which had the phonetic value of [*ki~*kʌ~*ko] and 慕(~牟~馬) represented the variants which had the phonetic value of [*mo~*ma~*mʌ]. Therefore I would presume that ‘枳慕~支牟~只馬~古馬’ etc. had been used as a different transcriptions at the old times. Among these, ‘古馬彌知’ was correspondent with ‘馬邑’ in the place name reformed by the King Kyung Deok at the time of Unified Sylla Dynasty. In this case ‘馬’ represented the meaning of ‘big’ or ‘large’ which modified the following noun ‘邑’(town, city) and so ‘馬邑’ was intended to record for the meaning of a ‘big town’. According to this analysis I would like to interprete that ‘古馬彌知’ was used to represent ‘a big town/city’ or ‘a large community’.In the Chinese records ‘固麻’ was correspondent with Old Korean ‘古馬’ and then it referred to ‘格們’ in the Manchuria historical records. At the Keum Dynasty, ‘格們’ meaned to ‘a big town’. So I should ascertain that they all had the same meaning of ‘big’ or ‘large’.‘密’ could be reconstructured as the [*mʌlj/*mɨlj/*ᄆᆞᆯ/*믈] which was the same as the phonetic value of ‘彌, 未, 米’ etc. Because [*mʌlj/ᄆᆞᆯ] had experienced a vocalization to [*mʌj/ᄆᆡ] and then it became to [mæ/매] by the monothongization. Vowel harmony variants [*mɨlj/믈] was changed to [*mɨ] by [j] deletion or [*mi] by [ɨ] deletion. ‘地, 知, 遲, 至’ etc. could be also reconstructured as [*ti/디] which was historically changed to [ci/지] by the palatalization in Modern Korean. The feature [+continuantclassic] of the [l/ㄹ] would be dissimilated with the following vowel feature [+continuant] and then [l/ㄹ] should become to [t/ㄷ] having a feature [+continuant]. Therefore ‘密地~彌知~彌里~彌離’ etc. could be composed of synonyms. These variants like [mʌj~mɨj~mɨ~mʌ~mi] and [mæ] were respectively distributed according to their regional and social situation. For example the name of tides was divided into two group depending on the location of South and North. In the South ‘한물, 두물, 세물, …’ were widely used on the other hand ‘한매, 두매, 세매, …’ were used in the North. The different forms of ‘물’ and ‘매’ were used at present. The ‘물’ was originated from the ‘密’ and ‘勿’ which had the same phonetic value as that of ‘水/water’. On the other hand the ‘매’ was originated from ‘彌, 未, 米, 買’ which had the same phonetic value [*mʌj]. These synonymous ‘密地, 彌知, 彌里, 彌離’ etc. had the same meaning as a ‘邑, 城, 村, 首都, 聚落’.The frequency of a velar and a palatal-alveolar was more similar before a front vowels other than back vowels. Moreover in the casual speech style the frequency of a [k] and [c] was appeared more similar before a front high vowel other than non-front high vowels. The acoustic similarities of [k] and [c] would be showed up their perceptive similarity. Consquently a hearer seemed to confuse [t] with [c] easily before a front high vowels. ‘枳慕[*kimo/기모]’ was frequently confused with the [*cimo] and would become to [*moci] by the syllable inversion of [*cimo] in Old Korean. The result of syllables movement still survive within the modern place name ‘모질매’ where the site of the Paek-Je Royal Palace was located at Ik-San."

Each retelling reflects the values, beliefs, social fabric, and the ties of kinship, etc. according to its regions and dates.  In Sanskrit literature, one of the most representative poets of Rāma-Kathā after Vālmiki is Kālidāsa. Unlike Vālmiki’s traditional heritage, Kālidāsa, in his epic poem Raghuvanśam (literally means ‘lineage of Raghu’), narrates the kings of Raghu dynasty where Rāma belongs to. In this respect, Raghuvanśam has a unique status in the Rāma-Kathā tradition.  Kālidāsa himself mentions in the preface of the poem (sarga 1/ślokas 1-10) that he will recites the story of the kings of Raghu dynasty following Vālmiki’s traditional heritage, but differently from other narratives.  Kālidāsa enumerates the characteristics of Raghu dynasty at the beginning, and then illustrates how those characteristics are manifest in the kings’ life and reign in sarga 19. In this article, based on Raghuvanśam text, the story of the kings of Raghu dynasty has been analyzed from the perspective of Rājadharma (literally means ‘dharma of the rulers’). In Raghuvanśam, Rāma-Kathā is described from sarga 9 to sarga 15, and here, Rāma is identified as the 7th avatar of Lord Viṣṇu, and the features of Rāma-Kathā of Raghuvanśam show the influence of Rājadharma. On that basis, I have looked into the reflection of Kālidāsa ’ s times and society throughout Raghuvanśam; and through this, I tried to identify an indigenous status of the work in the Rāma-Kathā tradition.  To Sum up, Kālidāsa wrote Raghuvanśam with the object of presenting Rājadharma necessary for his times and society; Raghuvanśam is Rāma-Kathā with Raghu dynasty story written for showing Rājadharma in which rules of kings and Brāhmaṇas centered Hindu culture of the Gupta period is reflected."

Motivated by this observation, we propose an efficient node deployment algorithm that determines the boundaries by using the well-known K-means algorithm and find the potential node locations based on the bi-section method for low-complexity design. We demonstrate through experiments that the proposed algorithm achieves significant localization performance over random node allocation with a substantially reduced complexity as compared with a full search."
실루엣을 적용한 2단계 인공벌군집 데이터 클러스터링,2018,"['Silhouette', 'Number of Clusters', 'Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)', 'Data Clustering']",,"A popular data clustering K-means uses the only intra-cluster distance for valid index with given fixed number of clusters in prior. We can’t use K-means without fixed number of clusters for the unsupervised data. K-means is also sensitive for initialization and has the possibility to be stuck in local optimum because of hill climbing clustering method. Silhouette valid index can be used to decide the number of clusters with considering the intra and inter cluster distances. But, it needs much computation time to evaluate the solutions. So, we need more efficient data clustering method. The objective of this paper is to propose the two-step Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) which is based on Silhouette in the second step using initial solutions using K-means in the first step to find the global optimal data clustering solution with appropriate number of clusters within limited computation time for the unsupervised data. The performance of ABC using Silhouette is validated using several real data sets by experiment and analysis."
Partial Discharge Data Analysis with Unsupervised Classification,2018,"['Partial Discharge', 'Unsupervised Classification', 'PRPD', 'K-means clustering']",,"This study described partial discharge(PD) distribution analysis between the XLPE( Cross-Linked PolyEthylene)and EPDM(Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) interface with unsupervised classification. The φ-q-n patterns were analyzed using phase resolved partial discharge(PRPD). K-means cluster analysis forms a cluster based on similarities and distances among scattered individuals, and analyzes the characteristics of the formed clusters, dividing the multivariate data into several groups according to the similarity of each characteristic, Is a statistical analysis that makes it easier to navigate. It was confirmed that the phase angle of the cluster with the maximum discharge charge was concentrated around 0 ° and 180 ° at 30 kV after the initial phase distribution localized around 90 ° and 300 ° expanded to the whole phase angle according to the voltage rise. The Euclidean distance between the center of gravity and the discharge charge in the Φ-q cluster increased with increasing applied voltage."
Clustering Algorithm for Time Series with Similar Shapes,2018,"['Time Series', 'Clustering', 'Similar Shape', 'Modified K-Means']",,"Since time series clustering is performed without prior information, it is used for exploratory data analysis. In particular, clusters of time series with similar shapes can be used in various fields, such as business, medicine, finance, and communications. However, existing time series clustering algorithms have a problem in that time series with different shapes are included in the clusters. The reason for such a problem is that the existing algorithms do not consider the limitations on the size of the generated clusters, and use a dimension reduction method in which the information loss is large. In this paper, we propose a method to alleviate the disadvantages of existing methods and to find a better quality of cluster containing similarly shaped time series. In the data preprocessing step, we normalize the time series using z-transformation. Then, we use piecewise aggregate approximation (PAA) to reduce the dimension of the time series. In the clustering step, we use density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) to create a precluster. We then use a modified K-means algorithm to refine the preclusters containing differently shaped time series into subclusters containing only similarly shaped time series. In our experiments, our method showed better results than the existing method."

박은식의 ‘종교’ 담론,2018,"['Park Eun-sik(박은식(朴殷植))', 'discourse on religion', 'civilization', 'Confucianism', 'morality(K: dodeok 도덕(道德))', 'the national spirit(K: gukhon 국혼(國魂))', 'public virtues(K: gongdeok 공덕(公德))', 'Great Unity(K: daedong 대동(大同))', 'study of mind-heart(K: simhak 심학(心學))', 'innate knowledge of the good(K: Yangji 양지(良知))', 'substance of morality', 'sacred inner master']",,"This paper seeks to illuminate BaekAm(白巖) Park Eun-sik(朴殷植, 1858~1927)’s discourse on religion formed in the context of Confucian reformation during the modern transitional period, focusing on the status and features of ‘Confucianism’.First of all, BaekAm saw the essence of religion as morality(K: dodeok 道德) and defined the religion as the learning of morality. Regarding the Christian Reformation as a major cause of western modern civilization, he pursued the protection of nation and achievement of civilization through the reformation of Confucianism. At the level of nation-state, religion as the national principia was the root of politics. He believed that Confucianism, the main religion having the cultural legitimacy, would contribute to the construction of a unified nation state based on the moral maturity of people with Confucian education. In particular, He insisted that forest of Confucianists(K: yurim 儒林) should be people-oriented moral practical subjects devoting themselves to the nation state with the enthusiasm of saving the world.Second, Park Eun-sik, in the situation of Korea’s independence movement, emphasized the ethnicity of religion on which “the national spirit(K: gukhon 國魂)” had relied. From the viewpoint of the evolution of morality, he stressed the public virtues(K: gongdeok 公德) for the country and the people rather than the private virtues(K: sadeok 私德) only for oneself and one’s own family.Third, Park Eun-sik stressed the importance of communication with other religious cultures or thoughts as the source of religious creativity in an age of Great Unity(K: daedong 大同). He presented the Confucius’s teaching of Great Unity making the world shared publicly on the basis of humanity (K: In 仁) as the substance making all things one body. The bliss and pleasure of Great Peace (K: taepyeong 太平) in time of Great Unity, had the meaning of resistance and criticism against all inequalities and violence. BaekAm, in the position of moral cosmopolitanism, insisted on winning the national independence and freedom through pacifism and humanism against the Japanese Empire’s militarism.Fourth, Park Eun-sik, on the basis of study of mind-heart(K: simhak 心學), posited that the fundamental core study dealing with the mind-heart practice should preside the rational science. Especially he, classifying the Dohak(道學, the study of Tao) and the Sokhak(俗學, ordinary study) by the standard of moral substance as the Heaven’s mandate, reduced the Dohak as the problem of innate knowledge of the good(K: yangji 良知). And the inner sacred master as the moral substance was presented as the ontological foundation of all religions. The spiritual civilization based on philosophy should preside the material civilization based on rational science. He believed that philosophy and religion shared the common task of constructing moral community through the subjective awareness of moral substance and the practical actualization of it.In conclusion, Park Eun-sik, defining religion as the learning of morality leading to modern civilization, stressed the religion’s public morality at the level of nation-state, and presented the sacred inner master as the ontological foundation of all religions. In particular he imagined the complementary relation between philosophy and religion for the complete realization of morality. In this sense, it can be said that Park Eun-sik’s discourse on religion, based on the modern study of mind-heart, creatively converged Confucian tradition and Western modernity."

First, he posited that humans could “communicate directly (K: jiktong 直通)” with the Lord on High as the transcendent sovereign through the mind-heart of spiritual intelligence. On the horizontal level, the human as a being of spiritual intelligence would have everyday encounters with other people with the ethical responsibility of fulfilling the good nature. Man, transcending all other creatures on the basis of spiritual intelligence, has the right to utilize them and the duty to care for their natural lives through political management policies. Jeong Yag-yong, criticizing the Joseon(朝鮮)’s Neo-Confucian theory on human mind-heart and nature based on Principle-Material force(K: IGi 理氣) metaphysics, constructed a new theory of human mind-heart and nature grounded on the concept of “spiritual body (K: yeongche 靈體)”, namely the original body of spiritual intelligence. His concept of spiritual body consisted of nature (K: seong 性) as ethical appetites (K: kiho 嗜好) for the good, balance (K: gwonhyeong 權衡) corresponding to the free will, and the actual practice (K: haengsa 行事). He classified all phenomenological modes of mind-heart into the way mind (K: dosim 道心) manifested from the ethical appetite for the good and the human mind (K: insim 人心) issued from bodily desires. Jeong Yag-yong especially stressed the existential conflict between the way mind and the human mind throughout the course of ethical practice; he came to the new spiritual awareness that the way mind is the Heaven’s mandate(K: dosimjeukcheonmyeong 道心卽天命).Jeong Yag-yong’s notion of the way mind as Heaven’s mandate carries distinctive features in its form, status, and content. First, Heaven’s mandate is conveyed every moment not through a natural phenomenon or the physical body but through the formless way mind. Second, the way mind, not only the manifestation of good nature but also the Heaven’s mandate, combines the immanent goodness of human nature in the Mencius (『孟子』)and the transcendent authority of Heaven’s mandate in the Mean (『中庸』). In this sense, it has attained the status of wondrous combination of Heaven and man (K: cheoninmyohap 天人妙合). Third, unlike the mystical quest for pure consciousness or the monotheistic worship of God as the Wholly Other, the way mind as Heaven’s mandate does not transgress human ethics. The heart of Jeong Yag-yong’s new spirituality lies in his sensitive religious consciousness accepting the ethical voice of the way mind as Heaven’s mandate.Jeong YagYong’s new Confucian spirituality based on human ethics as the way of relationships practiced by honoring virtuous nature (K: jondeokseong 尊德性) has the following characteristics. First of all, it shows the characteristics of humanly orientation(K: hyangin 嚮人) for ethical relationship rather than the characteristics of heavenly orientation(K: hyangcheon 嚮天) for the transcendent personal God or the characteristics of earthly orientation(K: hyangji 嚮地) for the cosmological unity of material world.

SAR 간섭기법을 활용한 하와이 킬라우에아 화산의 2018 분화 활동 관측,2018,"['Kīlauea Volcano', 'Eruptive activity', 'Interferometric SAR', 'Magma source modeling', 'Timeseries deformation']","2018년 4월 말부터 감지되기 시작한 킬라우에아 화산의 최근 마그마 분화 활동은, 5월과 6월에 걸쳐 용암의 분출과 함께 급격한 지표 변형을 발생시켰다. 킬라우에아 정상부에 위치한 Halema`uma`u 분화구에서는 용암호의 수위가 빠르게 하강하여 대규모 지반 침하 및 지반 붕괴가 나타났으며, GPS와 경사계의 기록을 통해 약 2미터 가량의 변화를 감지할 수 있었다. 이 연구에서는 단 기간에 큰 변화를 보인 킬라우에아 분화 활동의 초기과정에 대해 다중 시기 COSMO-SkyMed SAR 영상을 이용한 시계열 지표변위 분석을 수행하고자 하였다. 전체 관측기간에 대해 측정된 최대의 지표 변위는 위성의 관측방향으로 약 -1.5미터이며, 입사각을 고려하여 수직변위로 변환할 때 약 -1.9미터의 침하를 나타낸다. 또한 대부분의 지표 변위는 분화 직후인 5월 초에서 6월말 사이에 발생하며, 7월부터는 안정기에 들어선 것을 확인할 수 있다. 시계열 지표변위를 통해 마그마 소스 모델링을 실시한 결과, 마그마 챔버가 지표로부터 2-3 km 사이에 위치하는 것으로 산출되었으며, 마그마 소스의 중심 위치는 남서부 방향으로 이동하는 것으로 관측되었다. 이러한 마그마 모델의 시계열 변화는 편향된 관측자료를 통한 초기 결과이므로 이후의 연구에서 정밀한 3차원 관측을 이용한 보완이 필요할 것으로 보여진다.","Recent eruptive activity at Kīlauea Volcano started on at the end of April in 2018 showed rapid ground deflation between May and June in 2018. On summit area Halema`uma`u lava lake continued to drop at high speed and Kīlauea’s summit continued to deflate. GPS receivers and electronic tiltmeters detected the surface deformation greater than 2 meters. We explored the time-series surface deformation at Kīlauea Volcano, focusing on the early stage of eruptive activity, using multi-temporal COSMO-SkyMed SAR imagery. The observed maximum deformation in line-of-sight (LOS) direction was about -1.5 meter, and it indicates approximately -1.9 meter in subsiding direction by applying incidence angle. The results showed that summit began to deflate just after the event started and most of deformation occurred between early May and the end of June. Moreover, we confirmed that summit’s deflation rarely happened since July 2018, which means volcanic activity entered a stable stage. The best-fit magma source model based on time-series surface deformation demonstrated that magma chambers were lying at depths between 2-3 km, and it showed a deepening trend in time. Along with the change of source depth, the center of each magma model moved toward the southwest according to the time. These results have a potential risk of including bias coming from single track observation. Therefore, to complement the initial results, we need to generate precise magma source model based on threedimensional measurements in further research."

The investigator as their sub-homeroom teacher monitored their free play in the forest from November 3, 2017 to the end of January 2018 36 time, and performed interviews with paintings in addition to analyzing the meaning of their happiness. Based on the study results, first was ‘the release of instinct to run’ as the meaning of their happiness from their free play in the winter forest. The children who left limited indoor place to go to the wider place ran without feeling the cold weather. Second, it was ‘play with imagination and creation.’ In the winter forest where there was a lack of playing things, they acknowledged the snow-covered forest as the new space and enjoyed the process to make their own imaginative play using the snow and nature. Third, it was ‘challenge, cooperation, and a sense of collaborative accomplishment.’ They showed scenes to take care each other’s safety when challenging their friends with difficult play situations. The fourth one was ‘calm space to think and search something.’ The children often sought their own space to think in the wide forest space and became silent because they were absorbed by their activities. The fifth one was ‘meeting with my friends and nature.’ They showed they experienced the different weather and changes in insects by seasons, and considered nature as a living friend, and accordingly, consider living creatures to be precious. Based on the results of this study, changes in the educational space of early childhood education institutions and changes in the new role of teachers are proposed using winter forest free play for children."

"Estimating Ocean Tidal Constituents Using SAR Interferometric Time Series over the Sulzberger Ice Shelf, W. Antarctica",2018,,,"Ocean tides in Antarctica are not well constrained mostly due to the lack of tidal observations. Especially, tides underneath and around ice shelves are uncertain. InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) data has been used to observe ice shelf movements primarily caused by ocean tides. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to estimate tidal constituents underneath the Sulzberger ice shelf, West Antarctica, solely using ERS-1/2 tandem mission DInSAR (differential InSAR) observations. In addition, the tidal constituents can be estimated in a high-resolution (~200 m) grid which is beyond any tidal model resolution. We assume that InSAR observed ocean tidal heights can be derived after correcting the InSAR data for the effect of atmospheric loading using the inverse barometric effect, solid earth tides, and ocean tide loading. The ERS (European Remote Sensing) tandem orbit configuration of a 1-day separation between SAR data takes diminishes the sensitivity to major tidal constituents including K1 and S2. Here, the dominant tidal constituent O1 is estimated using 8 differential interferograms underneath the Sulzberger ice shelf. The resulting tidal constituent is compared with a contemporary regional tide model (CATS2008a) and a global tide model (TPXO7.1). The InSAR estimated tidal amplitude agrees well with both models with RMS (root-mean-square) differences of < 2.2 cm and the phase estimate corroborating both tide models to within 8˚.

However, previous researches for measuring similarity between crime cases have some limitation which makes it difficulty to be applied to real investigation document analysis. In this paper, we develop a new measure to quantify the similarity between two crimes by measuring similarities items related to investigation, come from the index of dissimilarity in demography. In addition, focused on break-in burglary, we apply this measure to the real data set which is extracted from investigation-related documents for real break-in burglary cases occurred in 2011~2015.

Liberal arts colleges had to compete with universities equipped with vocational majors such as agriculture and mechanical arts. But it was not until 1980s that the number of liberal arts colleges fell dramatically. Worries grow as some liberal arts colleges merged with bigger universities and others closed operations. Many predict the majority of liberal arts colleges will disappear or lose their identity. In the mean time, some universities in Korea introduced liberal arts colleges (K-LAC). K-LAC is unique in that it is a college covering liberal education within a university. We may expect K-LAC will restore liberal education, once neglected or distorted in Korean university system.

A comparative study of low-complexity MMSE signal detection for massive MIMO systems,2018,"['simplified matrix inversion', 'classical iterative method', 'minimum mean square error', 'signal detection', 'massive MIMO']",,"For uplink multi-user massive MIMO systems, conventional minimum mean square error (MMSE) linear detection method achieves near-optimal performance when the number of antennas at base station is much larger than that of the single-antenna users. However, MMSE detection involves complicated matrix inversion, thus making it cumbersome to be implemented cost-effectively and rapidly. In this paper, we first summarize in detail the state-of-the-art simplified MMSE detection algorithms that circumvent the complicated matrix inversion and hence reduce the computation complexity from □(K<sup>3</sup>) to □(K<sup>2</sup>) or □(NK) with some certain performance sacrifice. Meanwhile, we divide the simplified algorithms into two categories, namely the matrix inversion approximation and the classical iterative linear equation solving methods, and make comparisons between them in terms of detection performance and computation complexity. In order to further optimize the detection performance of the existing detection algorithms, we propose more proper solutions to set the initial values and relaxation parameters, and present a new way of reconstructing the exact effective noise variance to accelerate the convergence speed. Analysis and simulation results verify that with the help of proper initial values and parameters, the simplified matrix inversion based detection algorithms can achieve detection performance quite close to that of the ideal matrix inversion based MMSE algorithm with only a small number of series expansions or iterations."

First, faculty members defined as well balanced competence type were more than the average level in TPACK. Second, faculty members belonged to development required competence type reported below the average level in TPACK. Thus, faculty members in this type were required to increase teaching competence. Finally, faculty members in lack of technology competence type were needed to enhance competence related to technology because their overall TK level was relatively low.

Ihak 理學 C. lixue) as its ruling ideology. The learning of principle was also called the “learning of the Way”(K. Tohak 道學 C. daoxue). While the learning of principle is a value neutral concept used to explain all things by the principle, the learning of the Way is a concept that contains the logic of regarding other theories as heterodox teachings along with the strong sense of the lineage of the Way. The learning of the Way of Chosŏn has been mostly used as a term merely referring to meanings and principles focusing on practicality(義理實踐) of the Confucian scholars, including Kim Goeng-pil and Cho Kwang-jo. As the learning of the Way was introduced during the late Koryŏ period, however, the diverse usages of the term were found and moreover, its characteristics changed over a period of time.In the late 14th century the learning of the Way was used as a term indicating Cheng-Zhu learning from the Yuan dynasty or the learning of the principle itself. The learning of the Way focused on the way of study maintaining constant inquiry and study(道問學) and regulating the world(經世實踐). Especially the characteristics stood out as the logic of regarding Buddhism and Taoism as heterodox teachings. In the 15th century, the usage of the learning of the Way also based on classical studies and focused on the way of study maintaining constant inquiry and study(道問學) and regulating the world(經世實踐). The learning of the Way based on classical studies played a role as statecraft learning or ideology for rulers as well as literati. However, as hegemonic rulers like King Sejo or Prince Yŏnsan and corrupt political forces such as old meritorious elites emerged, it came to be difficult to rectify the society only with the learning of the Way valuing the classical studies based on the explication of the classics. Hence, from the late 15th century, the learning of the Way related to cultivate oneself(節義實踐) was advocated while the learning attitudes of honoring virtuous nature(尊德性), such as controlling the mind, nourishing inner nature, and abiding in reverence, were greatly encouraged. The learning of the Way was extended to the learning of the heart-mind (K. simhak 心學 C. xinxue), which was concerned with the cultivation of mind.Above all, the key point of the learning of the Way is carrying on the orthodox lineage of the Way. Among the scholars pursuing the learning of the principle in the late Koryŏ and early Chosŏn it was Yi Saek who was aware of the orthodox lineage of the Way. Yi Saek claimed the authenticity of the learning of principle from Yuan dynasty by putting Xu Heng on the rank of the orthodox lineage of the Way. The arguments on the orthodox lineage of the Way in the late Koryŏ and Early Chosŏn are divided into three categories: the argument on the shrine service to Chinese Confucian scholars, on the shrine service to Korean Confucian scholars, and on the Confucian scholars who were not served in the shrines. It is remarkable to note that opinions on the orthodox lineage of the Way were swayed by the social value of the time resulted in the incessant replacement of spirit tablets in the shrines.Arguments on the lineage of the Way in the late Koryŏ and early Chosŏn are characterized by the argument on the orthodox lineage of rulers and that of Confucian scholars. The argument on the orthodox lineage of rulers was an attempt to reestablish the royal lineage by the kings of Chosŏn, which was a state of the learning of the Way. This royal lineage was considered to have ceased since Emperor Wu of the Zhou dynasty. This was exposed in the idea proposed by Chŏng To-jŏn and Park ŭi-Jung. The argument on the orthodox lineage of Confucian scholars was the assertion that, after Confucius, the Way passed down to the Chinese literati was again transmitted to the Confucian scholars of Chosŏn. The argument is subdivided into the officially recognized form of shrine service and the form of the orthodox lineage of the Way approved by the Confucian scholars.The orthodox lineage from Yi Che-hyŏn through Yi Saek to Kwŏn Kŭn was mainly accepted by the literati up to the 15th century. All of them, however, were removed from the object of spirit tablets by reason of either inclination to Buddhism or lack of fidelity. In reality, in the late Koryŏ and early Chosŏn there were various arguments about the orthodox lineage based on transmission of scholarship. The first of them was the lineage of the Way from Xu Heng to Yi Saek. The second was the lineage from Yi Che-hyŏn through Yi Saek to Kwŏn Kŭn. The third was the lineage from Yi Saek through Chŏng To-jŏn to Kwŏn Kŭn. The fourth was the lineage from Kwŏn Kŭn, Kil Jae, Kim Suk-ja, and Kim Jong-jik to Kim Gwing-pil. Besides, Pak Yŏng suggested the lineage from Chŏng Mong-ju, Kil Jae, Kim Suk-ja, Kim Jong-jik, Kim Gwing-pil, and Chŏng Pung to Pak Yŏng as well as we can see the movement of putting Kim An-kuk on the spirit tables, before Yi Hwang says four sages. In conclusion, as for the argument on the orthodox lineage in the late Koryŏ and early Chosŏn, there were various lineages of the Way, regardless of the orthodox lineage made by rural Neo-Confucian literati after the middle of the 16th century."

The 1958 International Tchaikovsky Competition and American winner Van Cliburn at the inaugural piano contest represents the most salient example of such duality of cultural contact during the Cold War. The present research proposes a way to cultivate regularized cultural bridgebuilding in inter-Korean relations modelled after the 1958 inaugural International Tchaikovsky Competition. The paper argues that a competition hosted by the cultural authorities of the two Koreas in the form of a traditional musical competition could be useful as a format for inter-Korean cultural exchange on a regular basis, as opposed to the sporadic nature of concerts and performances."
Coefficient of Earth Pressure at Rest of a Saturated Artificially Mixed Soil from Oedometer Tests,2018,"['sandstone-mudstone particle mixture', 'coefficient of earth pressure at rest', 'oedometer test', 'property of test specimen', 'property of test material']",,"The present study focuses on the coefficient of earth pressure at rest (K0) of a saturated crushed binary soil mixture. The mixture isartificially mixed by crushed sandstone and mudstone particles according to presupposed weight ratios and particle size distributioncurves. The oedometer tests are performed to determine the coefficient K0. From test data, the values of coefficient K0, which rangefrom 0.242 to 0.381, with a mean value of 0.300, are obtained. Just as other mechanical parameters of soils, the K0 value is affectedby many factors. The effects of the properties of test specimen and material are discussed on the basis of the test data. Strong negativecorrelation between the values of K0 and initial dry bulk density of test specimen, one between the values of K0 and median particlesize diameter of test material, and one between the values of K0 and gravel content by weight of test material, respectively, areobserved from the test data. The mudstone particle content by weight of the mixture may also affect the value of K0. The effects ofthese factors on the K0 value may exhibit interlocking effect. Higher interlocking effect results in higher shear strength, and thereforeresults in lower K0 value."

Tuning the surface morphology and local atomic structure of Mn-TiO2 thin films using rapid thermal annealing,2018,,,"<P>In this study, Ti0.95Mn0.05O2-delta nanostructured thin films were fabricated by pulsed laser deposition technique followed by rapid thermal annealing (RTA) in pure O-2 and N-2 atmospheres. The RTA process induced a substantial change in the surfaces morphology and local atomic structure around Ti4+ cation that have been studied by means of atomic force microscopy, Raman scattering and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. Raman spectra of the films were resembled to that of TiO2 rutile phase, and the change in the width of E-g (434 cm(-1)) Raman active modes has been attributed to oxygen non-stoichiometry. NEXAFS spectra were carried out in synchrotron facility at Ti/Mn L (3,2) edges and O-K edge. The ligand-field splitting, estimated from the energy difference between t(2g) and e(g) features in O K-edge spectra were similar to 2.81 eV for pristine and annealed film, which is a characteristic of the TiO2 rutile structure, and the asymmetry of t(2g) and e(g) bands at the O-K edge has been ascribed to oxygen vacancy (Vo(2+)). The annealing of film in O-2 gas optimized the surface structure and healed the Vo(2+) bridging, while the RTA in N-2 gas introduced Vo and reduced the valence state of Ti4+ (TiO2) into Ti3+ (Ti2O3) that have been probed by comparing the NEXAFS spectra of N-2 annealed film with the reference spectra of Ti2O3. Experimental and atomic multiplet calculations revealed that the Mn ions exist in 2+ valence state.</P>"

Bhabha, 1949~ )의 탈식민주의 담론 안에서 해석하는 작업을 통해, 작가의 미술 실천이 함의한 정치적인 의미와 효과를 밝히고, ‘정치’ 그 자체가 아닌 ‘미술’을 경유해 정치를 발화하는 미술가의 작품 근원에 놓인 미학적 의의를 고찰하는데 목적을 둔다.쇼니바레는 1980년대 후반, 서구중심적 미술 헤게모니에 대한 반동으로 야기된 ‘탈식민적 전환’기에 활동을 시작한 예술가다. 서구중심주의와 인종과 문화적 타자에 대한 문제들을 탈식민주의 관점에서 가시화한 작가이다. 탈식민주의 관점을 견지하는 쇼니바레는 ‘차이’를 초역사적이고 고정된 것으로 사유하는 본질주의에서 벗어나 의미 생산 과정에서의 담론적 ‘혼종성’을 인식함으로써, 서양과 동양, 흑과 백, 문명과 야만 등과 같은 위계적이고 적대적인 이항대립 구조를 단순히 역전하는 것이 아니라, 근본적으로 해체하고자 한다. 본고에서는, 최초의 탈식민주의 전시회로 기록된 2002년 ≪도큐멘타 Documenta 11≫에 출품했던 <정사와 간통(Gallantry and Criminal Conversation)>(2002)을 중심으로 혼종성에 기반한 텍스트 정치의 의미와 효과를 분석하고자 한다. 쇼니바레의 작품은 위계적이고 적대적인 이항대립의 조건들을 혼종적으로 연결함으로써, 그 ‘사이’에서 현존하는 ‘차이’들의 교섭 과정을 가시화하여, ‘사유의 공간’을 개방한다. 이를 통해, 쇼니바레의 작품은 우리의 사유를 제약하는 대립적이고 위계적인 이분법적 세계관에서 벗어나, ‘차이’ 구조와 상호 개입의 순간을 용인하고 통제할 수 있는 정치적 행위에 대한 이해의 계기를 제공한다.","This paper’s purpose is to determine the political and discursive effect  inherent in contemporary artist Yinka Shonibare’s artistic practice who is ‘writing back’ colonialism which has been forgotten by many of the contemporaries and to consider aesthetic meaning based on his artistic practice which tells us not ‘politics itself’ but ‘politics by art’.In this paper, I will to analyze the meaning and effect of textual  politics based on hybridity, focusing on Shonibale’s work, <Gallantry and Criminal Conversation>(2002). By recognizing the discursive ‘hybridity’ in the process of production, Shonibale does not simply reverse the dichotomous hierarchy or play hasty the integration of social hostility and contradiction. Rather, it links the conditions of the given opposition and visualizes the process of negotiation of the existing ‘differences’ in the ‘in between’. Through this, Shonibale’s work provides an opportunity for understanding the political act that can tolerate and control the ‘difference’ structure and the moment of mutual intervention instead of the hostile and confrontational politics based on a dichotomical worldview that restricts our reason."

First Near-infrared Imaging Polarimetry of Young Stellar Objects in the Circinus Molecular Cloud,2018,,,"<P>We present the results of near-infrared (NIR) linear imaging polarimetry in the J, H, and K-s bands of the low-mass star cluster-forming region in the Circinus Molecular Cloud Complex. Using aperture polarimetry of point-like sources, positive detection of 314, 421, and 164 sources in the J, H, and Ks bands, respectively, was determined from among 749 sources whose photometric magnitudes were measured. For the source classification of the 133 point-like sources whose polarization could be measured in all 3 bands, a color-color diagram was used. While most of the NIR polarizations of point-like sources are well-aligned and can be explained by dichroic polarization produced by aligned interstellar dust grains in the cloud, 123 highly polarized sources have also been identified with some criteria. The projected direction on the sky of the magnetic field in the Cir-MMS region is indicated by the mean polarization position angles (70 degrees) of the point-like sources in the observed region, corresponding to approximately 1.6 x 1.6 pc(2). In addition, the magnetic field direction is compared with the outflow orientations associated with Infrared Astronomy Satellite sources, in which two sources were found to be aligned with each other and one source was not. We also show prominent polarization nebulosities over the Cir-MMS region for the first time. Our polarization data have revealed one clear infrared reflection nebula (IRN) and several candidate IRNe in the Cir-MMS field. In addition, the illuminating sources of the IRNe are identified with near-and mid-infrared sources.</P>"

Arrow)의 “불가능성 정리”(impossibility theorem)를 적용해보려고 시도하였다. 즉, 불가능성 정리를 이용하여 이 글에서는 개인들 간의 의견의 차이가 있을 경우에 입법절차의 결과를 지배한 의견이 입법의도라고 보는 것이 타당하지 않을 수 있음을 보여주고자 하였다.이를 위하여 먼저 제2장에서는 입법기관의 입법의도에 관한 종래의 논의를 살펴보고 구체적으로 어떤 점이 문제가 되는지 검토하였다. 제3장에서는 입법의도에 관한 논의를 전개하기 위하여 입법기관을 구성하는 개인이 가지고 있는 것으로 전제해야만 하는 선호의 합리성에 대하여 설명하였다. 이후에 제4장에서는 입법기관의 선택이 그 기관에 속한 개인들의 선호를 올바르게 반영한 것일 수 있기 위한 조건들을 살펴보았다. 그리고 제5장에서는 그러한 조건들을 만족하는 사회후생함수란 존재하지 않는다는 애로우의 불가능성 증명을 검토하였다. 끝으로 제6장에서는 이러한 애로우의 불가능성 증명이 역사적 해석과 관련하여 가지는 의미를 살펴보고자 하였다.","The historical interpretation has long been emphasized on “legislative intention” among other theories of legal interpretation. It might be because of the fact that law itself is the institution that gives a significance to a legislator’s authority. Nevertheless, the position putting emphasis on legislative intention in legal interpretation comes to meet with a problem as follows: What does the legislative intention concretely signify in an legislative body or an organization other than one individual? This study attempted to apply K. Arrow’s “Impossibility Theorem” as regards such a problem. In other words, this study tried to show that it could not be legitimate to regard an opinion, which governs the result of legislative proceedings, as legislative intention in case of the existence of a difference in views between individuals.To this end, this study looks into the existing discussion about legislative intention of the legislative body in Chapter 2, and examines which aspects become a problem in the concrete. In Chapter 3, this study gives an explanation about rationality of preference ,which must be premised as a being possessed by an individual who composes the legislative body, in order to develop a discussion about legislative intention. Afterwards, in Chapter 4, this study looks into the conditions for making it possible for a choice of the legislative body to properly reflect the preference of the individuals belonging to the agency. In addition, In Chapter 5, this study examines Arrow’s “Impossibility Theorem”, the argument that social welfare function which meets such conditions, doesn’t exist. In Chapter 6, this study intends to look into its meaning in the relation to the historical interpretation of law."

Methods: A descriptive survey was conducted from January 2013 to April 2014 in South Korea. 222 pregnant women responded to three questionnaires developed by the authors. The questionnaire for I-PGSD consisted of 19 questions; 18 questions for K-PGSD; and 10 questions for ATP. Results: Mean scores were 80.46±11.73 for I-PGSD; 14.86±3.74 for K-PGSD; and 33.71±6.13 for ATP. The ATP score was positively correlated with the I-PGSD and K-PGSD scores, but statistically significant with only I-PGSD (p=.006). I-PGSD scores were higher than average on three genetic syndromes (Down, Patau, and Edwards syndrome), on management after the diagnosis of positive fetal aneuploidy, and on test result interpretation after the amniocentesis and level II fetal ultrasonogram. Conclusions: In light of current legal and moral controversy regarding terminating pregnancy and rapidly advancing prenatal genetic testing technology, more prenatal genetic education for nurses and nursing students who teach pregnant women is needed. In addition, more professional counseling services provided by trained nurses are also required."

It is important to examine the labor of K-pop idols in that K-pop idol industry is at the center of the entertainment service industry, which consistently expands. In order to construct a theoretical lens, this study firstly considers the implication of the concept of ‘emotional labor’ advanced by Hochschild, focusing on how workers’ emotion is exploited by capital and how they experience alienated during their labor. This study also incorporates the implications of the notion, ‘affective labor’, advanced by Hardt and Negri. The concept affective labor implies that its mode triggers human interactions, exchanges, and relations. This means that human interactions and relations can be exploited by capital. Based on the implications of the two notions, this study finds that idol trainees in the audition show work along with the ethics of ‘competition’ and ‘solidarity’. The show emphasizes the ‘ethics of competition’ to the trainees in order to encourage them to improve their merit, as well as ‘the ethics of solidarity and mutual benefit’ as a means to promote their affective labor. Traditionally, the formation of a community based on solidarity and reciprocity was regarded as a solution to the problems of personalization and fragmentation that occur in overheated competition. In other words, solidarity has been understood as a cornerstone of anti-capitalist projects and the realization of democracy. However, it was found in the show that the ethics of solidarity and reciprocity were instrumentalized and capitalized in the entertainment service industry as work ethics."
Transport Velocity of Perilla Grain on Oscillating Sieve in Elliptical Motion,2018,"['Elliptical motion', 'Four-bar linkage', 'Throwing index', 'Screening', 'Thresher sieve']",,"Purpose: The objective of this study was to propose a formula for the theoretical grain mean transport velocities of an elliptically moving oscillator by modifying the grain mean transport velocity formula applied to linear motion and to compare the calculated values with the experimental values of grain mean transport velocity. Methods: The values of the throwing index (K<sub>v</sub>) and the maximum horizontal velocities for various positions on the elliptical oscillator were obtained using kinematic analysis. To obtain the actual grain transport velocity, the mean transport velocities of perilla grains at six positions on the sieve surface were measured using a high-speed camera and compared with the theoretical values. The cam with an eccentric bearing on the oscillator was designed to be eccentric by 1.6 cm so that the lengths of the major axis of the elliptical motion were 3.2-3.6 cm. The material used in the experiments was perilla grain. Results: The experimental result was consistent with the theoretical value calculated using the proposed formula (R<sup>2</sup> is 0.80). It is considered that the angle difference between the maximum accelerations in the directions vertical and horizontal to the sieve has as much influence on the grain mean transport velocity as the value of Kv itself. Conclusions: It was possible to theoretically obtain the grain mean transport velocities through a screening device in elliptical motion by modifying the formula of the grain mean transport velocities used in linear motion."

The process is as follows: Based on the preliminary spiritual practices of the Six-fold mind (ṣaṭ citta), Liberating Insight into dharmadhātu which is defined as the existence of non-existence is produced by the method of asllakṣaṇapraveśalakṣaṇa. The Six-fold mind is an intellectual method for spiritual practice, which examines the words and meanings of the teaching of sutra. The Six-fold mind could be said to be the internalization of the method of exegesis on the sutra. On the contrary, asallakṣaṇapraveśalakṣaṇa is a mystical method that removes the ordinary and mundane distinction between the grasped and the grasper, but gives rise to the direct and supra-mundane insight into dharmadhātu defined as the existence of non-existence. In the Avavādānuśāsanyadhikāra, asallakṣaṇapraveśalakṣaṇa is considered as the main method to produce Liberating Insight and the Six-fold mind is considered as a preliminary method for asllakṣaṇapraveśalakṣaṇa. In this regard, the Avavādānuśāsanyadhikāra appears to integrate the mystical method as the main position with an intellectual method as subordinate position.The Liberating Insight that is generated as a result of asallakṣaṇapraveśalakṣaṇa is basically defined as a non-discriminating cognition (nirvikalpajñāna) that lacks the grasped and the grasper as its object. It has the existence of non-existence, namely dharmadhātu, as its object. This non-discriminating cognition of dharmadhātu is a transcendental recognition that arises when the ordinary discriminating cognition disappears. At the same time it is also intellectual recognition, because it recognizes a sort of conceptual object, namely the existence of non-existence. Liberating Insight of Avavādānuśāsanyadhikāra is, on the one hand, a mystical recognition in terms of the disappearance of the mundane and dualistic mode of mind. On the other hand, it is a rational recognition in terms of the appearance of supra-mundane insight into the highly conceptual object defined as the existence of non-existence.In conclusion, Liberating Insight of Avavādānuśāsanyadhikāra could be regarded as a harmonious integration of a mystical tradition and a rational tradition."

Korean-Parental Overprotection Scale (K-POS) was administered to 1,035 high school students. 33 students who reported high K-POS score (1.5 SD above the mean) were assigned to overprotected group and non-overprotected group of 33 students was randomly selected from the students reporting scores within the average range. Participants were asked to provide consultation to a partner under conflict of interest situation. The results showed that overprotected students were more likely to pursue private profits than control group. However, the pursuit of private profits in overprotected group significantly decreased after morality priming. These results implied that parental overprotection negatively affect adolescents’ moral behavior and priming has an effect on promoting moral behavior.

Generalized Moment-Based Estimation of Gamma-Gamma Fading Channel Parameters,2018,,,"<P>In this paper, we propose generalized moment-based estimators of the Gamma-Gamma fading distribution. Specifically, the moment-based estimators are defined by using the <TEX>$k$</TEX> -th, the <TEX>$(k+1)$</TEX>-th, the <TEX>$l$</TEX>-th, and the <TEX>$(l+1)$</TEX>-th order moments. Hence, the new moment-based estimators, which can choose lower order moments, have more degrees of freedom than existing estimators. In order to compare their performance, the normalized mean square error is taken into account. We validate, by Monte Carlo simulations, that the new moment-based estimators with lower order moments are superior to the existing estimators over various channel conditions.</P>"

Stenhouse’s Curriculum Model appeared as an alternative to R. Tyler’s Curriculum Model. Tyler’s Model has been called the Objectives Model in which the objectives(intended learning outcome) are regarded as standard of teaching (or making of teaching materials). L. Stenhouse’s Curriculum Model is called the Process Model because in that model the processes of teaching are regarded as standard of teaching. L. Stenhouse’s Model has another aspect which manifests itself by the name of the Research Model. In that model, developed curriculum are not regarded as something final or finished but as something to be revised or improved. The Research Model has been influenced by K. Popper’s Piecemeal Social Engineering which denies the existence of utopian ideal standard in the social reform. Developed curriculum must be revised or improved. But by whom? In what places? According to the Research Model, it must be revised by teachers themselves in no other places than the classroom. The Research Model has been influenced by K. Lewin’s Action-Research. Action-Research stresses the practicality of research and performance. L. Stenhouse’s Curriculum Model which is composed of the Process Model and the Research Model, has its own way of thinking.

As a result of analyzing the students’ works and the results report, they led positive responses such as artistic expression of everyday life, meaning making process, self-reflection and communication of doctrine, possibility of creative expression. On the other hand, the understanding and application of the postmodern art making strategies on a superficial level and the intuitive and subjective process of individual meaning making without social and contextual inquiry are pointed out as the limit. In order to improve this, it is necessary to faithfully explore the postmodern art making strategies, and it is necessary to elaborate the expression system through reflection on the process of meaning making."
Role of Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography in Evaluation of Choledocholithiasis in Patients with Suspected Cholecystitis,2018,['Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography Choledocholithiasis Multidetector Computed Tomography Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography Sensitivity and Specificity'],,"Purpose: To determine the role of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in evaluation of choledocholithiasis in patients with suspected cholecystitis.Materials and Methods: A total of 78 patients (mean age: 66.06 ± 15.63 years; range: 21–94 years, Male:Female = 31:47) who had experienced symptoms of cholecystitis and who underwent computed tomography (CT), MRCP, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography from January 2013 to February 2015 were included in this study. Two reviewers independently interpreted CT and MRCP images to determine the presence or absence of choledocholithiasis and cholelithiasis.Diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy) was compared between CT and MRCP. Interobserver agreement was also evaluated.Results: Forty-three patients underwent cholecystectomy. The accuracy of CT and MRCP for detection of gallbladder stones showed no significant difference. The sensitivity and accuracy of MRCP for detection of extrahepatic duct stones were superior to those of CT for both reviewers (reviewer 1: MRCP: sensitivity, 73.3%; accuracy, 76.9%; CT: sensitivity, 50%, accuracy 59%; p = 0.01; reviewer 2: MRCP: sensitivity, 75%; accuracy, 73.1%; CT: sensitivity, 50%; accuracy, 56.4%; p = 0.018). The interobserver agreement was consistent for both CT (k-value: 0.738) and MRCP (k-value: 0.701).Conclusion: MRCP showed superior diagnostic performance for the detection of choledocholithiasis with reliable interobserver agreement. Considering the lack of radiation and contrast enhancement, MRCP would be an appropriate first-line modality in evaluation of common bile duct stones in patients with suspected cholecystitis."

One hundred six controls were recruited from each middle school in two cities of South Korea. The parent version of the original MDQ-A was translated into Korean. The parents of all participants completed the K-MDQ-A. The diagnoses of bipolar disorders were determined based on the Korean version of K-SADS-PL. The test-retest reliability with a 10-month interval was investigated in 33 bipolar adolescents.Results: K-MDQ-A yielded a sensitivity of 0.90 and a specificity of 0.92 when using a cut-off score of endorsement of 5 items, indicating that symptoms occurred in the same time period and caused moderate or serious problems. The internal consistency of the K-MDQ-A was good. The correlations between each item and the total score ranged from 0.40 to 0.76 and were all statistically significant. Factor analysis revealed 3 factors that explained 61.25% of the total variance. The mean total score was significantly higher in bipolar adolescents (7.29) than in controls (1.32). The Pearson correlation coefficient for the total test-retest score was 0.59 (p＜0.001).Conclusion: The K-MDQ-A completed by parents showed the excellent validity and reliability and may be a useful screening tool for adolescents with bipolar disorders attending in- and outpatient psychiatric clinics."

An eclecticism that considers national benefit and protection of the law which is a country’s proper function of judicature judgment as a major benefit and protection of the law and incidentally and indirectly protects personal benefit and protect of the law such as legal safety of the falsely accused has been accepted as a conventional wisdom and a precedent for over 50 years. Such a eclecticism seems to import a Germany’s theory through Japan’s calumny. Korea’s calumny differs from Germany and Japan’s legal penalties. Other countries’ legal penalties on calumny are higher than on perjury protecting a country’s judgmental function. However, Korea’s upper limit of legal penalties on perjury or destruction of evidence are two times higher. Thus, to establish the benefit and protection of the law of Korea’s calumny, its content needs to be different from the eclecticism of Germany and Japan protecting either national benefit and protection of the law or personal benefit and protection of the law selectively.There is no disagreement in establishment of calumny on the grounds of approvals by the falsely accused or abetting false accusation against oneself in the eclecticism and precedents in Korea. It means that calumny is established without a violation of personal benefit and protection of the law. On the contrary, can individuals’ legal safety be in danger while there is no violation of national benefit and protection of the law? It cannot take place according to Korean legal provisions related to calumny. Thus, the substance of Korea’s eclecticism should be considered as a theory to judge the establishment of calumny on the basis of national benefit and protection of the law. The falsely accused which a criterion that has been put up when judging the number of crimes of calumny by eclecticism is not accurate. That is because it does not judge the number of crimes based on benefit and protection of the law and there is no reason to put up secondary benefit and protection of the law as a standard of judgement. Therefore, the judgment on the number of crimes of calumny by eclecticism and the judgement by national benefit and protection of the law lead to the same conclusion according to the general theory of the theories of the number of crimes.Calumny is not to protect a country’s judgmental function itself but people who could be in danger if such a function does not work properly. That relationship between national benefit and protection of the law and personal benefit and protection of the law is common to every crime classified as criminal offenses related to national benefit and protection of the law in the present penal code.  Therefore, it is appropriate that the benefit and protection of  the law of calumny  is also understood as national benefit and protection of the law. However, if calumny is understood as national benefit and protection of the law, its relation with obstruction of justice by deception becomes problematic. Such a problem has not been discussed due to a common notion which understands the two crimes’ benefit and protection of the laws differently, and they become crimes protecting the same benefit and protection of the law. The judiciary has recognized the responsibility to uncover truths of investigative agencies in only obstruction of justice by deception, not in calumny. Because of this, a phenomenon of distortion that calumny of which legal penalty is much higher is constituted easier has been tolerated. Apart from criminal law, there is a　number of special laws which have separate calumny according to crimes regarded as calumny and they are contradictory to the basic principle of law of calumny, so they need to be deleted."

I focused on the concepts of the true body (眞身, saṃbhoga-kāya) and the avatar (化身, nirmāṇa-kāya) of the Kwaneum Bodhisattva (觀音菩薩, Avalokiteśvara) which are identified in the story of Euisang (義相) and Wonhyo in 「Naksan-edaesoung Kwaneum Joungchuy Choshin」. The narrative of Euisang discusses the experience of the true body (saṃbhoga-kāya) of Kwaneum based on 『Hwaeomkyeong (華嚴經)』.In Wonhyo’s story however, the incarnation (avatar, nirmāṇa-kāya) of Kwaneum happened to be an ordinary person who lived in Shilla (新羅). This demonstrated that familiar and vulgar beings encountered on this country could be regarded as incarnations of Kwaneum.Wonhyo’s story is one of the articles collected under the heading 「Naksan-edaesoung Kwaneum Joungchuy Choshin」 which is centered on the Kwaneum Bodhisattva who was believed to have lived in Naksan (洛山). This reveals that the avatar of Kwaneum, who appeared as the Shilla citizen Wonhyo saw on the way to Naksan, was a manifestation of Kwaneum residing in Naksan. In this story, Wonhyo was employed as a mediator for, and witness of, an indigenized avatar of Kwaneum. It was attributed to his role as the forerunner of Buddhist teachings for the general public in Shilla society.The 「Bomunpum (普門品)」 of 『Beophwakyeong (法華經)』 which had been circulated in Shilla society before the introduction of Huayan thought (華嚴思 想) by Euisang became the basis of Wonhyo’s faith in Kwaneum. This is a representative scripture that emphasizes the avatar of Kwanuem as a means (方 便, upāya) of salvation for people. From this perspective, the article 「Naksanedaesoung Kwaneum Joungchuy Choshin」 combines Euisang and Wonhyo’s practical orientation toward the faith of Kwaneum. It also shows the way in which Kwanuem beliefs became indigenous to Shilla society."

The sound value of '音汁' reconstructed in Late Old Chinese is same as or close to [<sup>*</sup>ʔrimʨip]. Sometimes initial <sup>*</sup>ʔ was used to express <sup>*</sup>k- and the medial -r- was used to express the liquids ending -r by metathesis in translation of Old Korean. So the Chinese character 音汁[<sup>*</sup>ʔrimʨip] could be used for expressing [<sup>*</sup>kirmʨip] in ancient Korea. The word meaning 'red' in Turkish is kırmızı[kirmizi], and those of some Altaic languages around the Black Sea resemble each other. They are similar to [<sup>*</sup>kirmʨip]. The place names of '檢丹, 金谷, 거름, 갈뫼' in Angang(安康) originated from [kirm], for the sound values of 檢[<sup>*</sup>kramʔ], 金[<sup>*</sup>krЩm], 거름[kərim], 갈뫼[kalmø] are similar to [kirm]. In conclusion, we could argue that the place name '音汁伐[<sup>*</sup>kirmʨipəl]' meant 'red field'.Sabak-ri(士朴里) near Eumjeupbeol located to the south of Violet Jade Mountain(紫玉山) in Angang also have relation with the Sabok-hol(沙伏忽) and Sabi-geul(沙非近乙) in Goguryeo(高句麗) and Sobi-po(所比浦) in Baekje(百濟). The Words of 'Sabok, Sabi and Sobi' meaning 'red' in Old Korean are similar to <sup>*</sup>ǯibi of Mongol which originated from Proto-Altaic <sup>*</sup>ĺip‘ú meaning 'dark red, violet and purple'. Old Chinese initial <sup>*</sup>lj- changed to Middle Chinese initial z-, and [z] is close to [ʒ], and [z], [ʒ] were pronounced as [s] in Old Korean. So <sup>*</sup>ĺip‘ú of Proto-Altaic and <sup>*</sup>ǯibi of Mongol correspond to sabak(士朴), sabok(沙伏), sabi(沙非) and sobi(所比) of Old Korean. They meant dark red, purple or violet. The place name of Eumjeup-beol(音汁伐) and Sabak-ri(士朴里) are closely related to the word meaning red and dark red in Turkish and Mongol belonging to Altaic family. It is very suggestive concerning the origin of Korean."

For this, a survey on the perception of learning ethics was conducted targeting total 112 freshmen including 54 liberal arts students and 58 science & engineering students of K university in Seoul, taking the writing course opened for freshmen. The composition of the questionnaire was largely divided into two parts such as items related to general academic performance and items related to completion of assignments, and for the responses to the survey questions, the 5-point Likert Scale was used.. In the results of this study, the mean value of ethics related to general academic performance was 4.0 or up, which was relatively high. However, the items related to assignment were lower than the mean, which showed the low level of perception of learning ethics. Meanwhile, regarding the differences in the perception of ethics in accordance with sex and affiliation, overall, the male students and the freshmen in science & engineering showed the lower perception of learning ethics than female students and freshmen in liberal arts. The items of ethics related to the completion of assignments showing the low mean values included ‘double submission of assignments, transfer of assignments, joint marking of non-participants in assignments, partial marking of sources, plagiarism of development structure/methods of the original text, and the act of changing into his/her own words without marking the source of the original .

場所の助詞「に」と「で」の誤用の原因の分析,2018,"['日本語の助詞「に」と「で」', '場所', '使い分け', '誤用', '韓?人日本語?習者', 'Japanese particles “ni” and “de”', 'location', 'usage', 'usage errors', 'Korean Japanese learner']",,"Among the particles used in two countries with similar morphology, Japanese particles “に(ni)” and “で(de)” and Korean particles “에(e)“ and”에서(eseo)“ have a common meaning to express location. Particles ""ni"" and ""e"" are used to indicate ”place of existence“ and ""de"" and ""eseo"" are used to indicate ""place where behavior and action occur."" A Korean Japanese learner corresponds the particles one to one without difficulty. In doing so, a problem may arise as the correct answer rate surpasses 90%.  Therefore, regarding the selection of particles “ni” and “de,” Lee (2017)(2018)’s study shows that Korean Japanese language learners (major, non-major) in the initial learning stage have tendencies to use fixed phrases ""position+ni"" and ""place name+de."" In addition, Lee (2017)(2018) backed up the tendency of selection of such particles in precedent study, and clearly supports the results of the usage errors of particles ""ni"" and ""de"" to represent place in relation to the influence of learning and of one’s mother tongue through an experiment conducted on November 2013. (Examinees: majors in Busan P. University (73 students), non-majors in Busan K. University (73 students))  Although the method of experiment follows a similar pattern to previous studies of Lee (2017)(2018), this study analyzes the survey conducted on November 2013 and reclassifies the questionnaire based on learning level and not the period of learning. More than 95% of non-major students were excluded form the survey as they do not have a qualified language certificate.  The following results were obtained based on the comparison and contrast of location particles “ni” and “de” used by major students of different level. The causes of usage errors can be largely divided into four. ① Difference in level: the accuracy rate of semi-advanced level (N2) learners is slightly higher than advanced level (N1) learners. ② Influence of learning: A: excessive use of ""ni"" compared to “de” and over-generalization of the fixed phrases ""position+ni"" and “place name+de.“ (Su et al. (2006)) B: A unit of noun+particle formation is created when selecting particles ""ni"" and ""de."" (Noda et al. (2001), Sakuda (2001)) ③ Frequency of learning materials: ”Mae(前)“ and ”naka(中)“ used to represent location comes up fewer times than ”ni“ and ”de“ in ”Minnano Nihongo 1,2.“ ④ Influence of mother tongue: Korean Japanese learners are influenced greatly by the mother tongue in expressions ”to live (~sumu)“ and ”to stay (~tomaru).“ Especially the results that the accuracy rate of beginning level students are ranked slightly higher than semi-advanced to advanced level students in the case of ""tomaru"" shows discrepancies with the study done by Ozeki (2007)."

Wells', 'The War of the Worlds', 'Ambivalence', 'Japanese translation', 'Acculturation']",,"This paper looks at how the text was written in the late Victorian period, how it was then translated into the Japanese Empire during the 1940’s and how its original message was transformed by comparing H. G.Wells’ The War of the Worlds to the Japanese translation, Kasejin to no Sensō (War with the Martians, 1941). In The War of the Worlds, we can read the ambivalence in Wells’ critique of imperialism and colonialism. The text encourages patriotic anxiety by imagining Britain invaded by Martians. It advocates that the Martians are driven by an incessant struggle for existence and cannot help invading the earth. It thus criticizes western imperialism and colonialism by comparing the relationship between the Martians and Earthlings to that of the animals and indigenous people, whose civilizations have gone extinct. However, the Japanese translation weakens this ambivalence and turns it into a text promoting imperialist aggression. The death of the Martians in The War of the Worlds means a defeat to the history of the struggle for survival on Earth. Thus, the death of the Martians is inevitable.The deletion of this evolutionary context in Kaseijin to no Sensō turns the Martians’ death into a coincidence with the help of allies, not something inevitable. As the death of the Martians changes from inevitable to accidental the patriotic anxiety of the original text is further emphasized and the message of the imperialist criticism of the original text weakened."

In Korea, because of the foreign exchange crisis in the late 1990s, accounting transparency issues have become important to enterprises, the expansion of the stock market and the use of K-IFRS have proved it already. However, despite of the growth of Korean companies and accounting systems, the IMD(International Institute for Management Development) ranked Korea as the lowest among 61 countries surveyed in the accounting transparency category in 2016. To guarantee accounting transparency to overcome this problem is a very emergency task because it is closely related to economic growth. Therefore, this paper studies the subject of earnings transparency.This study examines the effect of earnings transparency on the firm value and also the differences of the impact by corporate governance characteristics. In this study, earnings transparency is proxied by measures developed by Cheng and Subramanyam(2008) and firm value proxied by Tobin s Q. The sample consists of firm-year which has December fiscal year-end and listed on the securities market over 2011-2017.Empirical results are as follows. First, earnings transparency is significantly and positively associated with the firm value. This means that higher the earnings transparency is, the greater the firm value is. Second, this study finds that the firm value increased on the earnings transparency when firms with business group affiliation, outside director system and board size, foreign ownership ratio are high. Non-significant results are observed when the largest shareholder ownership ratio are low. This results support some arguments that earnings transparency can be used as one of the explanatory variables for accounting transparency. Our research findings will facilitate the management of earnings transparency in domestic enterprises and contribute to the practical assessment of the company s intrinsic value."

As a result, regardless of the contraction lengths, the minimum value of the axial mean velocity component at the entrance of the plenum chamber is increased through the contraction and has the maximum value in the test section. When the flow passes through the inner space of the analytical models, the average pressure and axial force due to the surface pressure acting at the inlet of the plenum chamber is the smallest at the contraction length of 1,000 mm, but the axial force due to the surface stress increases as the contraction length increases. The maximum turbulent kinetic energy in the test section decreases as the contraction length increases. Comprehensively, it can be concluded that the contraction length of 1,000 mm at the contraction area ratio of 9:1 is the best choice for wind tunnel selection with superior performance."

In this paper, we proposed a purely balanced cross entropy measure by modifying the balanced cross entropy for association threshold. As a result, the cross entropy is an unbalanced measure considering only a part of the confidence measures. The balanced cross entropy is a measure that takes account of all confidence measures, but the terms in each log term are not mutually exclusive. On the other hand, purely balanced cross entropy is a measure by which denominator and molecule are not affected by each other.

Sipjipum 十地品), in the Collection of Annotations of Avatamsaka Sutra (K. Hwaeomsocho 華嚴疏鈔) in order to highlight the unique features and differences of their understandings of Buddhism. Earlier studies, such as an account by a Buddhist monk from the modern period, Park Han-young, have revealed that Yeondam and Inak had a distant relationship, in regard of the periodical surroundings of their times and their different views on Buddhism. But this study tries to suggest definite evidences of an academic interchange between them by examining their annotations on the Avatamsaka Sutra. Shown below is the three evidence of the contention. Firstly, only from Yeondam’s collection of annotations, Yumanggi (Ch. 遺忘記), explanatory diagrams (K. Gwado 科圖) are found. Secondly, the comments on the annotations of the Avatamsaka Sutra made by Seolpa, Yeondam, and Inak all have traces of amendments. Thirdly, the collections of annotations of Yeondam and Inak have dealt with the same issue but they explained it in a different manner. On the basis of these three evidences, it is possible to assume that they each made annotations on the Avatamsaka Sutra in different times and manners. Given the fact that the annotations from latter date added new explanations to its preceding writings, it is reasonable to understand that there were academic interchanges between the three monks. As a result of examinations on Yeondam and Inak’s annotations, the former seems to have pursued deeper understandings on the meaning of the Avatamsaka Sutra while the latter have aimed to conduct meticulous examinations. This study also tried to elucidate the difference of Yeondam and Inak’s understandings on the meaning of the Avatamsaka Sutra. As an example, about the meaning of a phrase “都無所得”, which is read as “there is nothing to gain”, from the Collection of Annotations of Avatamsaka Sutra, Yeondam tried to interpret those words from the perspective of Yogacara Thought, while Inak tried to read them in the relation with the Avatamsaka Study. Yeondam’s approach to deal with the issue on the basis of the phenomenal world and Inak’s approach to explain it from the view of fundamental world suggest their different Buddhist perception. This study examines only a small part of the two monks’ annotations on the Avatamsaka Sutra in order to highlight the differences in their thought. It is anticipated that more detailed analysis on the rest of their writings will reveal further distinctive features of their ideas on Buddhism."

Protective Role of Parenting Attitude on the Behavioral and Neurocognitive Development of the Children from Economically Disadvantaged Families,2018,"['Parenting', 'Home environment', 'Nurturing', 'Behavior', 'Neurocognitive', 'Development']",,"Objective Association between home environment and the behavioral and neurocognitive development of children from a community childcare center for low-income families was examined (aged 6 to 12 years, n=155).Methods The parents performed a questionnaire on home environment (K-HOME-Q) to assess home environment including parenting attitude and the Child Behavior Checklist (K-CBCL). The children performed the Wechsler Intelligence (IQ) Scale, Stroop interference test (Stroop), word fluency test (WF), and design fluency test (DF) to assess their neurocognitive development.Results ‘Nurturing of Development’ and ‘Variety of Language Interaction’ scores from the K-HOME-Q, were inversely associated with total behavior problems, externalization, rule-breaking, and aggressive behavior subscales of K-CBCL, and ‘Emotional atmosphere’and ‘Tolerance toward the child’ scores showed inverse associations with the total behavior problems, rule-breaking, aggressive behavior, and withdrawn/depressed subscales. Despite economic hardship, the mean scores of the neurocognitive tests were comparable to the average level of Korean children’s normative sample. However, ‘Nurturing of Development’ and ‘Tolerance toward the Child’ score of KHOME-Q were associated with better executive function (IQ, WF, DF).Conclusion These results suggest that parental stimulation of development and tolerant parenting attitude may offer protection against the negative effects of suboptimal economic environment on children’s behavior and neurocognitive development."
Automatic Glaucoma Detection Method Applying a Statistical Approach to Fundus Images,2018,"['Glaucoma', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Optic Neuropathy', 'Fundus', 'Classification']",,"Objectives: Glaucoma is an incurable eye disease and the second leading cause of blindness in the world. Until 2020, thenumber of patients of this disease is estimated to increase. This paper proposes a glaucoma detection method using statisticalfeatures and the k-nearest neighbor algorithm as the classifier. Methods: We propose three statistical features, namely,the mean, smoothness and 3rd moment, which are extracted from images of the optic nerve head. These three features areobtained through feature extraction followed by feature selection using the correlation feature selection method. To classifythose features, we apply the k-nearest neighbor algorithm as a classifier to perform glaucoma detection on fundus images.Results: To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, 84 fundus images were used as experimental data consistingof 41 glaucoma image and 43 normal images. The performance of our proposed method was measured in terms of accuracy,and the overall result achieved in this work was 95.24%, respectively. Conclusions: This research showed that the proposedmethod using three statistics features achieves good performance for glaucoma detection"

To do this, we conducted a questionnaire survey of 157 college students of K University by using Kolb's Learning Styles Inventory(LSI) tool. The SPSS statistical package was used to conduct descriptive statistics, frequency analysis, and correlation analysis.The results of this study are as follows: First, these students preferred in order, Active Experimentation(AE), Concrete Experience(CE), Reflective Observation (RO), and Abstract Conceptualization(AC) based on Kolb’s Experiential Learning Model. Especially, in the case of Active Experimentation(AE), this tendency became more prominent as the school year goes up, Second, from Learning Styles of Kolb, it was in the order of Assimilator, Diverger, Accommodator, and Convergent.Third, from anticipated and final letter grades that are considered to be representative tools for measuring academic achievement, the higher the expected letter grades, the more likely students are to receive higher letter grades. In addition, they receive higher grades than their expected grades.Lastly, as anticipated grades of Assimilator students increase, final letter grades of their major study tended to increase. However, the students from the rest of Learning Styles did not predict their final letter grades. This means that Assimilator students are likely to predict the degree of learning performance based on their anticipated grades .This study identifies the distinctive Learning Styles among students’ majoring in Photography & Motion. The result reflects the typical educational environment of Visual Arts centered on image collection and development. Given the increasing educational and commercial interest and demand for persons with convergent talents that can solve various problems and create new knowledge, this study proposes to educate visual arts’ students to focus on problem solving rather than focusing media centered education."

This means that unless the consumer is interested in seeing the advertisement and is interested in the advertisement, the advertisement can not be delivered to the consumer. In other words, only a small number of meaningful information is accepted selectively (Robert guerin, 1957) because of the limitless information that can attract consumers' attention, and the maximum amount of information that consumers can simultaneously consider is 4 ~ 7 (John G.

Classification of Iris Colors and Patterns in Koreans,2018,"['Iris', 'Color', 'Pattern', 'Classification', 'Koreans']",,"Objectives: The iris is the part of the eye that is colored, and it is an important feature in making an artificial eye. To address the lack of information about the brown Korean irises, we classified the colors and patterns of the irises of 100 Korean eyes.Methods: The iris colors were extracted from 100 different digital photographs of each eye using K-mean clustering image analysis. The RGB data of the extracted colors were converted to CIELAB color space data and analyzed to determine the representative color of the iris in each photograph. The color differences were calculated to form groups of similar colors by matching the 100 samples into several groups with minimum color differences among them. The average hue value for each group was calculated, and the corresponding representative color was selected from 2 to 3 colors in one group. Results: The iris colors were classified into seven brown color groups with 2 to 3 colors in each group. The coloration of Koreans’ eyes appears to vary in a similar hue with differences in chroma and lightness. In addition, the iris patterns were classified into three basic patterns, namely, crown, sunshine, and flower, as well as three complex patterns that are mixtures of two basic patterns.Conclusions: We classified Korean iris colors and patterns for application in the design of artificial eyes."

Toquz Tatar is suggested as one evidence of the migration. Toquz Tatar means ‘Tatar with nine family names’ (九姓達靼), and the word is inscribed on Kül-Tegin Epitaph established in 731 as well as on Bilgä Qaγan Epitaph in 734 in the era of Second Türk Empire.

Development of Highway Safety Policies by Discriminating Freeway Curve Alignment Features,2018,"['highway safety', 'geometric complexness', 'cluster-based crash severity', 'multidirectional', 'cost-effective', 'policies']",,"In the Republic of Korea, severe crashes with injuries and fatalities have most frequently occurred in freeway sections withcombinations of horizontal and vertical curves. To address this issue related to geometric complexness, this study quantitativelyverified the adequacy of Korean highway safety policy and identified supplemental strategies required for the freeway sections withhorizontal and vertical curve combinations. Based on in-depth road geometric data, this study combined K-means clustering withbinomial logit regression to identify the effects of contributing factors on cluster-based crash severity levels. Resultantly, six clusterbasedcrash severity estimation models were produced. Single vehicle to roadside protective facility and multivehicle crash typeswere significant to decrease the likelihood of injury crashes for both full- and three cluster-based regression models. Compared withfull data model, driver’s age, action, crash occurrence time, and traffic management related factors were significantly identified inonly single cluster. The resultant findings show that multidirectional highway safety policies are further required for the currentKorean highway safety policy associated with curve alignment features. This study will assist in researchers and field practitioners’decision-making for future cost-effective highway safety policies provision related to freeway sections with geometric complexness."

A Comparison between Wet-only and Bulk Deposition at Two Forest Sites in Japan,2018,"['Atmospheric deposition', 'Dry deposition', 'Forests', 'Urban areas', 'Rural areas']",,"To investigate the effects of forest and the surrounding natural and anthropogenic sources on the bulk depositions on forested land, this study examined differences in ion concentrations between wet-only and bulk samples at two forested sites in Japan. The surrounding natural and anthropogenic sources at each site were different; Shirasaka is in a rural area and Tanashi is an urban environment. The volume weighted (vw) mean concentrations of K+ and Ca2+ in the bulk samples were significantly (p<0.05) higher than those in the wet-only samples at both sites. The forest canopy and a nearby incineration plant were hypothesized to be the main sources of K+ contaminants at Shirasaka and Tanashi, respectively. The transport of sea salt and urban dust may explain the presence of enriched Ca2+ concentrations in the bulk samples at Shirasaka and Tanashi, respectively. The NH4 + concentrations in the Shirasaka bulk samples were significantly (p<0.05) lower than those in the wet-only samples. The vw mean SO4 2- and NO3 - concentrations in both sample types were not significantly different at either site. This study demonstrated that the ion concentration differences between wet-only and bulk samples were affected by nearby natural and anthropogenic sources even at forest sites, similar to previous findings for non-forested locations. However, the K+ concentration differences between wet-only and bulk samples may be higher owing to forest sources, even in the absence of anthropogenic sources."

Myeongneung (明陵) was one of the most important royal tombs during late Joseon Dynasty, and is the burial place for King Sukjong (肅宗, 19th King of the Joseon Dynasty) and his 2 wives Empress Yinhyeon and Yinweon. King Sukjong’s two sons, Gyeongjong ( 20th King of the Joseon Dynasty) and Yeongjo (英祖, 21st King of the Joseon Dynasty) ruled after their father Sukjong, and were subsequently followed by Sukjong’s great grandson, King Jeongjo (正祖 22nd King of the Joseon Dynasty), who led the renaissance during the late Joseon dynasty. Myeongneung is not far from Seoul, which enabled easy visits by Sukjong’s descendants. The Academy of Korean studies has investigated the late Joseon Dynasty’s Neungguan system (陵官制度) in great depth through studying The Myeongneung Seonsaengan (明陵先生案, K2-524) and Myeongneung Chambong Seonsaengan ( 明陵參奉先生案, K2-4989), both which are owned by Jangseogak.  The royal mausoleum contains the ancestor king’s tombs and represented the service king’s filial devotion. In addition, the Neungguan’s role afforded him an opportunity to move up within the government bureaucracy, whether a new member of the bureaucracy or an existing member looking to take on a new position. The Neungguan’s role was not overly burdensome, and opened up opportunities to connect with influential people.It was also possible to quickly get promoted to the level of local government official.  Futhermore, the Neungguan position was a means to reduce officer promotion backlog in the late Joseon dynasty bureaucracy given Neungguan openings were regularly available in comparison to other roles within the limited bureaucracy system. To allay hiring and promotion issues within the late Joseon dynasty, the governing body created a hierarchy system within the Neungguan position itself, allowing for the promotion of individual’s within the role to a higher status Neunguan."

Nonparametric Bayesian test of homogeneity using a discretization approach,2018,"['Bayesian nonparametrics', 'contingency table', 'Dirichlet process prior', 'discretization', 'homogeneity test', 'small areas']",,"In this paper, we consider nonparametric Bayesian test of homogeneity using a hierarchical multinomial model with Dirichlet process priors in small area setup. If we discretize a continuous variable properly, the discretization approach could find some association between the groups and the variable even if the groups are homogeneous through k-sample tests involving one-way ANOVA. It could also be used to look at heterogeneity at specific levels of the variable of interest among groups. We use the clustering by the k-means and Dirichlet process to discretize the continuous variable. When we discretize the continuous variable, it can be treated as an analysis of the contingency table. Then the chi-squared test is the most common thought. If more slices are added, however, chi-squared test is less accurate. So we use the Bayes factor through the nonparmetric Bayesian model and apply it to the test of homogeneity."

In this study, we analyzed the mass concentrations and chemical compositions of the PM2.5 from May 2017 to May 2018. The average concentration of the PM2.5 was 25.8 μg/m3, and the mean concentrations of OC, SO4 2-, and NO3 - were 5.6 μg/m3, 4.4 μg/m3, and 3.9 μg/m3, respectively. The PM2.5 was highly correlated with the OC, SO4 2-, NO3 -, NH4 +, and K+, suggesting that biomass burning would be a main source of the PM2.5. During the high concentrations of the PM2.5, the fraction of the NO3 - was increased remarkably while the fraction of the OC, SO4 2-, and metals was decreased. From the CPF model, it showed that the source of the PM2.5 would be originated from the west side of Jeonju. In addition, using the HYSPLIT backward trajectories, it showed that the air masses during the entire periods were originated mainly from Mongolia and China."
영상정보에 기초한 전차 자율탐지 및 조준점탐색 연구,2018,,,"This paper presents an autonomous detection and aiming point computation of a battle tank by using RGB images. Maximally stable extremal regions algorithm was implemented to find features of the tank, which are matched with images extracted from streaming video to figure out the region of interest where the tank is present. The median filter was applied to remove noises in the region of interest and decrease camouflage effects of the tank. For the tank segmentation, k-mean clustering was used to autonomously distinguish the tank from its background. Also, both erosion and dilation algorithms of morphology techniques were applied to extract the tank shape without noises and generate the binary image with 1 for the tank and 0 for the background. After that, Sobel's edge detection was used to measure the outline of the tank by which the aiming point at the center of the tank was calculated. For performance measurement, accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure were analyzed by confusion matrix, resulting in 91.6%, 90.4%, 85.8%, and 88.1%, respectively."

Investigating Language Learning Strategies in English Conversation Using Non-hierarchical Cluster Analysis,2018,"['language learning strategies', 'non-hierarchical cluster analysis', 'conversation classes']",,"This paper on language learner strategies utilizes a little used quantitative, datamining technique called cluster analysis to investigate characteristics of groups of South Korean learners of English. After 71 students in three first-year university liberal arts English conversation courses completed the Strategy Inventory for Language Learning (SILL), and the number of learning strategies was reduced from 50 to 26 based on standard deviation (SD) results, the non-hierarchical (K-means) 3-cluster procedure was applied to the self-reported data. Following statistical analysis, each of the three cluster groups could be profiled according to achievement scores. At this point, six items emerged as particularly meaningful with regard to the latter, including direct strategies (a memory one and a cognitive one) and indirect strategies (two affective and two metacognitive). These strategies and their significance with reference to the local context as well as results previously reported in the literature are discussed. Finally, limitations of the study and implications for future research using cluster analysis are reported."

Non-Motor Symptom Burdens Are Not Associated with Iron Accumulation in Early Parkinson's Disease: a Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping Study,2018,"['Parkinson Disease', 'Iron', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging']",,"Background: Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) has been used to measure iron accumulation in the deep nuclei of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). This study examined the relationship between non-motor symptoms (NMSs) and iron accumulation in the deep nuclei of patients with PD.Methods: The QSM data were acquired from 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 29 patients with early PD and 19 normal controls. The Korean version of the NMS scale (K-NMSS) was used for evaluation of NMSs in patients. The patients were divided into high NMS and low NMS groups. The region-of-interest analyses were performed in the following deep nuclei: red nucleus, substantia nigra pars compacta, substantia nigra pars reticulata, dentate nucleus, globus pallidus, putamen, and head of the caudate nucleus.Results: Thirteen patients had high NMS scores (total K-NMSS score, mean = 32.1), and 16 had low NMS scores (10.6). The QSM values in the deep were not different among the patients with high NMS scores, low NMS scores, and controls. The QSM values were not correlated linearly with K-NMSS total score after adjusting the age at acquisition of brain MRI.Conclusion: The study demonstrated that the NMS burdens are not associated with iron accumulation in the deep nuclei of patients with PD. These results suggest that future neuroimaging studies on the pathology of NMSs in PD should use more specific and detailed clinical tools and recruit PD patients with severe NMSs."

The level of life satisfaction positively correlated with the score for the problem-focused CS subscale in the HOP group (r = 0.40, P = 0.027).Conclusion: We should pay more attention to the CSs of hemodialysis patients and provide interventions that promote problem-focused CSs, especially for nonadherent patients with high comorbidity rates who mainly use a hopeful-thinking CS."
Petrogenesis of the late Mesozoic highly fractionated I-type granites in the Luanchuan district: implications for the tectono-magmatic evolution of eastern Qinling,2018,"['geochemistry', 'petrogenesis', 'tectono-magmatic evolution', 'Luanchuan district', 'eastern Qinling']",,"Late Mesozoic granites are extensively distributed in the Luanchuan district of eastern Qinling and can be divided into two types: Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous granites (ore-related plutons) and Late Cretaceous granites (Laojunshan batholith). This study presents new geochemical and zircon U-Pb-Hf isotopic data from the Shibaogou and Yuku plutons to provide robust constraints on the petrogenesis and tectonic significance of the late Mesozoic granites in the Luanchuan district. Zircon U-Pb dating results yielded weighted mean 206Pb/238U ages of 149.1 ± 0.8 Ma and 150.5 ± 0.8 Ma, which were interpreted as the crystallization ages of the Shibaogou and Yuku plutons, respectively. We propose that the late Mesozoic granites contain high concentrations of SiO2 and alkali elements (Na2O + K2O) and feature metaluminous to weakly peraluminous characteristics. Enrichment in light rare earth elements and large ion lithophile elements and depletion in high field strength elements are observed. Mineralogical and geochemical evidence reveal that the late Mesozoic granites are highly fractionated I-type granites with fractional crystallization of feldspar, plagioclase and accessory minerals (e.g., apatite and titanite or magnetite). Based on the Hf composition, we suggest that the parental magmas of the ore-related plutons were derived from remelting of the Taihua and Xiong’er groups with minor contributions of mantle-derived materials and that the Laojunshan batholith was generated by the hybridization of ancient crust- (Kuanping group) and mantle-derived components. Collectively, the above arguments indicates a tectonic transition from compression to post-collisional extension during the late Mesozoic, that was likely triggered by the continental collision of the North China Block and the Yangtze Block, which generated numerous contemporaneous granites and Mo-W-Pb-Zn-Ag-Au poly-metallic deposits."

Kirschner-wire was used to directly reduction the bony fragment, and extension block pinning and dis-tal interphalangeal joint fixation were additionally performed to minimize the loss of reduction. Postoperative pain, range of motion, and radiological evaluation were performed. Duration of bone healing, functional recovery and complication rate were evaluated and Crawford’s criteria was used to determine functional outcome after surgery.Results: Bone union was achieved in all cases after a postoperative mean of 6 weeks (5-7 weeks). An average of 2.8° (0°-10°) extension loss occurred in all patients. All patients showed satisfactory joint congruency and reformation of the joint surface, the mean flexion angle of the distal interphalangeal joint at the final follow-up was 72.2° (70°-75°). According to Crawford’s classification, 12 patients (66.7%) were excellent and 6 patients (33.3%) were good.Conclusion: Modified-intrafocal pinning technique is a method of obtaining anatomical bone healing by directly reduc-tion and fixation of the bony fragment. Combined with other conventional percutaneous pinning procedures, it is expected that good results can be obtained if applied to appropriate indications."

To do this, we first extracted a set of keywords by applying TF-IDF methods selected by a series of comparative experiments on various statistical weighting schemes that can measure the importance of individual words in a large set of texts. In order to effectively calculate the semantic relation between extracted keywords, a set of word embedding vectors was constructed by using about 1,000,000 news articles collected separately. Individual keywords extracted were quantified in the form of numerical vectors and clustered by K-means algorithm. As a result of qualitative in-depth analysis of each keyword cluster finally obtained, we witnessed that most of the clusters were evaluated as appropriate topics with sufficient semantic concentration for us to easily assign labels to them."
State Estimation Network Design for Water Distribution Systems,2018,,,"<P>State estimation (SE) involves estimating state variables of interest that cannot be directly measured by using measurable variables. In water distribution system (WDS) SE, nodes are often aggregated to reduce the number of unknowns. To achieve high SE accuracy, the optimal observation locations in the WDS should be determined. This paper proposes an optimal meter placement and node grouping (OMPNG) model for WDS demand estimation (DE). The nonlinear Kalman filter (NKF) method is used to estimate the nodal group demand (NGD) from pipe flow measurements at meter locations. A k-means clustering method is introduced to generate the initial node grouping for the proposed OMPNG model. An elitism-based genetic algorithm is employed to minimize the sum of the NGD root-mean-square errors (RMSEs). The proposed OMPNG model was applied to the modified Austin network DE problem, and the results were compared with those obtained by optimizing node grouping with fixed meter locations based only on engineering sense. The results showed that the proposed OMPNG model significantly improves the DE accuracy and reliability.</P>"

This study aimed to estimate effects of the source of household income on health care expenditure of the retirees. Based on the Korean Retirement and Income Survey (KReIS) data in 2011 and 2013, households were classified into one of the four groups―Asset income, Public pension income, Private transfer income, or Social security dependent―based on the income composition using K-means cluster analysis. Next, the effect of the major source of income on health care utilization of the retirees was estimated using the Two-Part Model analysis, after controlling for the determinants of health care utilization suggested by the Andersen Model. The results that, compared to the asset income dependent households, the health care expenditure of the pension income dependent households was 18.2% lower. In addition, the odds of using health services and the health care expenditure of the social security income dependent were 0.044 times and 53.6% lower, respectively. This results suggest that the source of household income is an important determinant of health care utilization alongside the income level."

Anomaly Detection in Sensor Data,2018,"['Sensor Data', 'Exploratory Data Analysis', 'Control Chart', 'ARIMA Model', 'Unsupervised Learning Algorithm']",,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to set up an anomaly detection criteria for sensor data coming from a motorcycle.Methods: Five sensor values for accelerator pedal, engine rpm, transmission rpm, gear and speed are obtained every 0.02 second from a motorcycle. Exploratory data analysis is used to find any pattern in the data. Traditional process control methods such as X control chart and time series models are fitted to find any anomaly behavior in the data. Finally unsupervised learning algorithm such as k-means clustering is used to find any anomaly spot in the sensor data.Results: According to exploratory data analysis, the distribution of accelerator pedal sensor values is very much skewed to the left. The motorcycle seemed to have been driven in a city at speed less than 45 kilometers per hour. Traditional process control charts such as X control chart fail due to severe autocorrelation in each sensor data. However, ARIMA model found three abnormal points where they are beyond 2 sigma limits in the control chart. We applied a copula based Markov chain to perform statistical process control for correlated observations. Copula based Markov model found anomaly behavior in the similar places as ARIMA model. In an unsupervised learning algorithm, large sensor values get subdivided into two, three, and four disjoint regions. So extreme sensor values are the ones that need to be tracked down for any sign of anomaly behavior in the sensor values.Conclusion: Exploratory data analysis is useful to find any pattern in the sensor data. Process control chart using ARIMA and Joe’s copula based Markov model also give warnings near similar places in the data. Unsupervised learning algorithm shows us that the extreme sensor values are the ones that need to be tracked down for any sign of anomaly behavior."

수출신용보험 청구권 양도와 보험자의 대위권 행사가능성에 대한 고찰,2018,"['Medium and Long-term Export Insurance', 'transfer of right', 'subject matter insured', 'subrogation', '중장기수출보험', '해외사업금융보험', '채권양도', '보험의 목적', '보험자대위']","중장기성 수출보험의 목적은 금융계약으로, 보험계약자는 현금유동성 확보 등을 이유로 보험에 부친 채권(금융채권)을 제3자에게 양도할 수 있을 것이다. 이는 보험목적의 이전으로, 중장기성 수출보험의 관계자 변경이 필연적으로 발생하게 된다. 이 때 관계자 변경은 보험계약자의 변경, 보험계약자가 피보험자를 지정하는 방법, 보험계약자가 보험금청구권자를 지정하는 방법의 세 가지 형태가 있다. 이 중 보험금청구권자를 지정한다는 것은 보험계약자가 금융채권을 제3자에게 양도하였으나, 보험계약 상의 지위는 자신이 보유한 채 보험금청구권만을 양도하는 것을 의미한다. 중장기성 수출보험에 부보된 금융채권이 양도되고 수출보험의 청구권이 양도되는 것은 보험계약의 효력 및 보험자의 대위권 행사의 문제가 발생한다.중장기성 수출보험의 목적이 양도되었음에도 불구하고 보험관계자 변경의 수단으로 보험의 목적의 양수인을 보험금청구권자로 지정하면, 채권양도의 실체에 따라 보험계약의 효력이 다르게 발생한다. 진정매매로 양도한 경우에는 피보험이익의 부재로 보험계약의 효력이 상실되고, 양도담보로 양도한 경우에는 보험계약의 효력을 유지할 수 있다. 다만, 보험금 지급 후 보험자대위권을 행사할 수 있는지의 문제에서 전자는 보험자대위권을 유효하게 행사할 수 없다는 문제점이 있고, 후자는 보험자대위권을 행사할 수는 있으나 수출보험의 경쟁력 및 금융창출의 효율성이 저하된다는 단점이 있다.위와 같은 문제에 대하여 무역보험기금의 건전성 및 보험계약자 등의 수출보험 이용 편의성을 제고하고자 다음과 같은 방안을 제시하고자 한다. 첫째, 보험금 청구권의 양도는 극히 제한적인 상황에서만 인정되어야 한다. 특히 보험의 목적이 양도되는 경우에 보험관계자 변경의 수단으로 보험금청구권을 양도하는 것은 보험계약의 효력 및 보험금청구권자의 경제적 실질에 부정적인 영향을 초래할 수 있으므로 지양해야 할 것이다. 둘째, 피보험자 지정을 적극적으로 활용한다. 현재 중장기성 수출보험의 약관은 자기를 위한 보험으로 구성되어 있어 피보험자에 관한 별도의 언급은 없다. 중장기성 수출보험의 약관은 기본적으로 자기를 위한 보험이라 할지라도, 경우에 따라서 보험계약자를 지정하는 것이 아닌 피보험자를 지정하는 것이 서로에게 더 큰 경제적 효익을 가져다 줄 수 있다.금융이 다변화된 모습을 취한다 하더라도, 수출보험에 부보된 금융계약의 내용변경은 금융계약 뿐만 아니라 보험계약의 법률관계에도 변경을 가져오기 때문에, 그 금융계약의 내용변경에 있어 앞으로도 신중하고 자세한 법리 검토가 필요할 것이다. 특히, 수출보험은 K-SURE의 자체 운영수익과 무역보험기금으로 운영되고 있기 때문에, 국가 정책적 차원에서 그 기금건전성을 유지하기 위한 많은 노력을 지속해야 한다.","The subject matter insured under the Medium and Long-term Export Insurance is right under the Financial Documents. A bank as a party of Financial Documents and Medium and Long-term Export Insurance contracts has incentives to transfer the right under the Financial Documents for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to cash liquidity, the management of the country risk, and funding through asset securitization. Once the Financial Documents is transferred, the related party of the Medium and Long-term Export Insurance will be changed. The type of change in related party includes the change of the policyholder, what the policyholder designates the insured, and what the policyholder designates the claimant.The designation of the claimant means that the policyholder only assigns the right under the Medium and Long-term Export Insurance without transfer of position as policyholder or insured. If the right under the Medium and Long-term Export Insurance is transferred and the assignee of the subject matter insured is designated as the claimant, the effect of the insurance contract is different according to the realization of the transfer or assignment. In the case of a real sale, the insurance contract will be invalid. However, the insurance contract may be retained if the right under the Financial Documents is transferred as collateral. The former has the problem that the insurer can not exercise the right of subrogation after the payment of insurance claim, and the latter can let the insurer exercise the right of subrogation.In order to improve the soundness of the trade insurance fund and the convenience of the use of export insurance by policyholders, the suggestions are the following measures. First, the transfer of right for insurance claim should be permitted only in very limited circumstances. The transfer of claim rights without the transferring right under the Financial Documents should be permitted because creditors can freely dispose of their property. However, if the subject matter insured is transferred, transferring claim right as a means of changing the Medium and Long-term Export Insurance contract party should be avoided as it may have a negative impact on the effect of the Medium and Long-term Export Insurance contract and the economic realities of the claimant.Second, actively use the designation of insured persons. Currently, the general terms and conditions of the Medium and Long-term Export Insurance consist of insurance for policyholder themselves, so there are no clauses in relation to the insured person. The general terms and conditions is based on an insurance for oneself, but in some cases, designating an insured rather than changing policyholder may lead greater economic benefits to related parties.Even if the financing is diversified, the change of the contents of the Financial Documents under the Medium and Long-term Export Insurance will have effects as not only modification of the Financial Documents but also change of legal relationships under the Medium and Long-term Export Insurance. The further study will be needed and meaningful because as export credit insurance is operated by K-SURE with their own operating revenues and trade insurance funds, it should continue its efforts to maintain the fund’s soundness at the national policy level."

초발 정신병 환자에서 기저핵 구조물 부피의 패턴분석,2018,,,"Objectives Dopamine dysregulation has been regarded as one of the core pathologies in patients with schizophrenia. Since dopamine synthesis capacity has found to be inconsistent in patients with schizophrenia, current classification of patients based on clinical symptoms cannot reflect the neurochemical heterogeneity of the disease. Here we performed new subtyping of patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) through biotype-based cluster analysis. We specifically suggested basal ganglia structural changes as a biotype, which deeply involves in the dopaminergic circuit. Methods Forty FEP and 40 demographically matched healthy participants underwent 3T T1 MRI. Whole brain parcellation was conducted, and volumes of total 6 regions of basal ganglia have been extracted as features for cluster analysis. We used K-means clustering, and external validation was conducted with Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Results K-means clustering divided 40 FEP subjects into 2 clusters. Cluster 1 (n = 25) showed substantial volume decrease in 4 regions of basal ganglia compared to Cluster 2 (n = 15). Cluster 1 showed higher positive scales of PANSS compared with Cluster 2 (F = 2.333, p = 0.025). Compared to healthy controls, Cluster 1 showed smaller volumes in 4 regions, whereas Cluster 2 showed larger volumes in 3 regions. Conclusions Two subgroups have been found by cluster analysis, which showed a distinct difference in volume patterns of basal ganglia structures and positive symptom severity. The result possibly reflects the neurobiological heterogeneity of schizophrenia. Thus, the current study supports the importance of paradigm shift toward biotype-based diagnosis, instead of phenotype, for future precision psychiatry."
Recognition of damage pattern and evolution in CFRP cable with a novel bonding anchorage by acoustic emission,2018,"['CFRP cable anchorage', 'acoustic emission', 'clustering-based pattern recognition', 'ultimate bearing capacity']",,"Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) cable has good mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. However, the anchorage of CFRP cable is a big issue due to the anisotropic property of CFRP material. In this article, a high-efficient bonding anchorage with novel configuration is developed for CFRP cables. The acoustic emission (AE) technique is employed to evaluate the performance of anchorage in the fatigue test and post-fatigue ultimate bearing capacity test. The obtained AE signals are analyzed by using a combination of unsupervised K-means clustering and supervised K-nearest neighbor classification (K-NN) for quantifying the performance of the anchorage and damage evolutions. An AE feature vector (including both frequency and energy characteristics of AE signal) for clustering analysis is proposed and the under-sampling approaches are employed to regress the influence of the imbalanced classes distribution in AE dataset for improving clustering quality. The results indicate that four classes exist in AE dataset, which correspond to the shear deformation of potting compound, matrix cracking, fiber-matrix debonding and fiber fracture in CFRP bars. The AE intensity released by the deformation of potting compound is very slight during the whole loading process and no obvious premature damage observed in CFRP bars aroused by anchorage effect at relative low stress level, indicating the anchorage configuration in this study is reliable."

Sizes of 25 microsatellite markers were decided using GeneMapper Software(v 5.0) after analyzing ABI 3130XL. A total of 153 alleles were observed and the range was 2 to 10 per each locus. The mean of expected and observed heterozygosity and PIC (Polymorphism Information Content) value was 0.53, 0.50, 0.46 respectively. The lowest genetic distance (0.073) was observed between YSO and SUO, and the highest distance (0.937) between the RIR and CBO. The results of clustering analysis suggested 3 clusters (ΔK=7.96). Excluding GBO population, 5 Ogye populations (YSO, ARO, CBO, CNO, SUO) were grouped in same cluster with high genetic uniformity (0.990, 0.979, 0.989, 0.994, 0.985 respectively). But GBO population was grouped in cluster 1 with low genetic uniformity (0.340). The results of this study can be use to basic data for the genetic evaluation and management of Ogye populations in Korea."
Anomaly Detection in Sensor Data,2018,"['Sensor Data', 'Exploratory Data Analysis', 'Control Chart', 'ARIMA Model', 'Unsupervised Learning Algorithm']",,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to set up an anomaly detection criteria for sensor data coming from a motorcycle. Methods: Five sensor values for accelerator pedal, engine rpm, transmission rpm, gear and speed are obtained every 0.02 second from a motorcycle. Exploratory data analysis is used to find any pattern in the data. Traditional process control methods such as X control chart and time series models are fitted to find any anomaly behavior in the data. Finally unsupervised learning algorithm such as k-means clustering is used to find any anomaly spot in the sensor data. Results: According to exploratory data analysis, the distribution of accelerator pedal sensor values is very much skewed to the left. The motorcycle seemed to have been driven in a city at speed less than 45 kilometers per hour. Traditional process control charts such as X control chart fail due to severe autocorrelation in each sensor data. However, ARIMA model found three abnormal points where they are beyond 2 sigma limits in the control chart. We applied a copula based Markov chain to perform statistical process control for correlated observations. Copula based Markov model found anomaly behavior in the similar places as ARIMA model. In an unsupervised learning algorithm, large sensor values get subdivided into two, three, and four disjoint regions. So extreme sensor values are the ones that need to be tracked down for any sign of anomaly behavior in the sensor values. Conclusion: Exploratory data analysis is useful to find any pattern in the sensor data. Process control chart using ARIMA and Joe's copula based Markov model also give warnings near similar places in the data. Unsupervised learning algorithm shows us that the extreme sensor values are the ones that need to be tracked down for any sign of anomaly behavior."

The proposed HMSV algorithm is 85%. These results are stable and high. It can be seen that this is better classified than using a general classification algorithm. The algorithm proposed in this paper is a stochastic modeling of the generation process of the characteristics included in the signal, and a good recognition rate can be obtained with a small amount of calculation, so it will be useful to study the relationship with diseases by showing fast and effective performance improvement with an algorithm that clusters nodes by simulating the stochastic flow of Gene Data through data mining of BigData."
"Arsenic speciation in environmental multimedia samples from the Youngsan River Estuary, Korea: A comparison between freshwater and saltwater",2018,"['Arsenic speciation', 'Bioaccumulation', 'Distribution coefficient (Kd)', 'Estuary', 'Salinity']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Differences in the distribution, partitioning, and bioaccumulation characteristics of arsenicals between freshwater and saltwater systems remain poorly understood. To determine the characteristics of distribution and behavior of arsenicals, multimedia environmental samples including water, suspended particles, zooplankton, sediments, and porewater were collected from inner (five sites, freshwater) and outer (five sites, saltwater) regions of the estuary dike of the Youngsan River Estuary in South Korea (Nov., 2012). Six organic and inorganic forms of As were separated and measured using HPLC–ICP/MS equipped with an anion exchange column. Concentrations of arsenicals in water samples of the inner region (mean = 1.5 μg As L<SUP>−1</SUP>) were significantly lower than in those of the outer region (mean = 5.2 μg As L<SUP>−1</SUP>). Conversely, concentrations of As in suspended particles in the inner region (mean = 14 μg As g<SUP>−1</SUP>) were much greater than in the outer region (mean = 5.7 μg As g<SUP>−1</SUP>). The field-based distribution coefficient (K<SUB>d</SUB>) for As depended strongly on salinity; relatively greater K<SUB>d</SUB> values were found in freshwater compared with saltwater. The As<SUP>V</SUP> was found to be the major form of As in all water and particle samples in both inner and outer regions. The zooplankton species were significantly distinguishable between the inner and outer regions; cladocerans were the most dominant species in freshwater and cyclopoida were predominantly found in saltwater. The As concentrations in zooplankton were shown to be particle-concentration dependent, suggesting that dietary exposure plays a substantial role in the bioaccumulation of As. Inorganic arsenicals, such as As<SUP>V</SUP> and As<SUP>III</SUP> were the most dominant forms found in zooplankton.

Gait Patterns in Parkinson's Disease with or without Cognitive Impairment,2018,"['Gait', ""Parkinson's Disease"", 'Cognitive Impairment']",,"Background and Purpose: Cognitive and gait disturbance are common symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Although the relationship between cognitive impairment and gait dysfunction in PD has been suggested, specific gait patterns according to cognition are not fully demonstrated yet. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate gait patterns in PD patients with or without cognitive impairment. Methods: We studied 86 patients at an average of 4.8 years after diagnosis of PD. Cognitive impairment was defined as scoring 1.5 standard deviation below age- and education-specific means on the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE). Threedimensional gait analysis was conducted for all patients and quantified gait parameters of temporal-spatial data were used. Relationships among cognition, demographic characteristics, clinical features, and gait pattern were evaluated. Results: Cognitive impairment was observed in 41 (47.7%) patients. Compared to patients without cognitive impairment, patients with cognitive impairment displayed reduced gait speed, step length, and stride length. Among K-MMSE subcategories, “registration,” “attention/calculation,” and “visuospatial function” were significantly associated with speed, step length, and stride length. However, age, disease duration, Hoehn-Yahr (HY) stage, or Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score was not significantly related to any gait analysis parameter. Conclusions: Our present study shows that cognitive impairment is associated with slow and short-stepped gait regardless of HY stage or UPDRS motor score, suggesting that cognitive impairment may serve as a surrogate marker of gait disturbance or fall in PD patients."

Microarray analysis allows the examination of levels of gene expression in specific cell samples, where thousands of genes can be analyzed simultaneously. However, microarray data have very little sample data and high data dimensionality. Therefore, to classify microarray data, a dimensional reduction process is required. Dimensional reduction can eliminate redundancy of data; thus, features used in classification are features that only have a high correlation with their class. There are two types of dimensional reduction, namely feature selection and feature extraction. In this paper, we used k-means algorithm as the clustering approach for feature selection. The proposed approach can be used to categorize features that have the same characteristics in one cluster, so that redundancy in microarray data is removed. The result of clustering is ranked using the Relief algorithm such that the best scoring element for each cluster is obtained. All best elements of each cluster are selected and used as features in the classification process. Next, the Random Forest algorithm is used. Based on the simulation, the accuracy of the proposed approach for each dataset, namely Colon, Lung Cancer, and Prostate Tumor, achieved 85.87%, 98.9%, and 89% accuracy, respectively. The accuracy of the proposed approach is therefore higher than the approach using Random Forest without clustering."

Methods: We used the US National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries over a 19-year period (1988-2006) to examine survivorship disparities in age, sex, race/ethnicity, and marital status of patients and risk status classified by histologic grade, stage, size of tumor, and number of multiple primary tumors among NMIBC patients (n=29 326). We applied Kaplan-Meier (K-M) and Cox proportional hazard methods for survival analysis. Results: Among all urinary bladder cancer patients, the majority of NMIBCs were in male (74.1%), non-Latino white (86.7%), married (67.8%), and low-risk (37.6%) to intermediate-risk (44.8%) patients. The mean age was 68 years. Survivorship (in median life years) was highest for non-Latino white (5.4 years), married (5.4 years), and low-risk (5.7 years) patients (K-M analysis, p<0.001). We found significantly lower survivorship for elderly, male (female hazard ratio [HR], 0.96), Latino (HR, 1.20), and unmarried (married HR, 0.93) patients. Conclusions: Survivorship disparities were ubiquitous across age, sex, race/ethnicity, and marital status groups. Non-white, unmarried, and elderly patients had significantly shorter survivorship. The implications of these findings include the need for a heightened focus on health policy and more organized efforts to improve access to care in order to increase the chances of survival for all patients."

Methods: Five sensor values for accelerator pedal, engine rpm, transmission rpm, gear and speed are obtained every 0.02 second from a motorcycle. Exploratory data analysis is used to find any pattern in the data. Traditional process control methods such as X control chart and time series models are fitted to find any anomaly behavior in the data. Finally unsupervised learning algorithm such as k-means clustering is used to find any anomaly spot in the sensor data.  Results: According to exploratory data analysis, the distribution of accelerator pedal sensor values is very much skewed to the left. The motorcycle seemed to have been driven in a city at speed less than 45 kilometers per hour. Traditional process control charts such as X control chart fail due to severe autocorrelation in each sensor data. However, ARIMA model found three abnormal points where they are beyond 2 sigma limits in the control chart. We applied a copula based Markov chain to perform statistical process control for correlated observations. Copula based Markov model found anomaly behavior in the similar places as ARIMA model. In an unsupervised learning algorithm, large sensor values get subdivided into two, three, and four disjoint regions. So extreme sensor values are the ones that need to be tracked down for any sign of anomaly behavior in the sensor values.  Conclusion: Exploratory data analysis is useful to find any pattern in the sensor data. Process control chart using ARIMA and Joe’s copula based Markov model also give warnings near similar places in the data. Unsupervised learning algorithm shows us that the extreme sensor values are the ones that need to be tracked down for any sign of anomaly behavior."

Itsearly appearing symptoms include tremor, rigidity, andvocal impairment (dysphonia). Consequently, speechindicators are important in the identification of PD basedon dysphonic signs. In this regard, computer-aided-diagnosissystems based on machine learning can be useful inassisting clinicians in identifying PD patients. In this work,we evaluate the performance of machine learning basedtechniques for PD diagnosis based on dysphonia symptoms.Several machine learning techniques were consideredand trained with a set of twenty-two voice disordermeasurements to classify healthy and PD patients. Thesemachine learning methods included linear discriminantanalysis (LDA), k nearest-neighbors (k-NN), naı¨ve Bayes(NB), regression trees (RT), radial basis function neuralnetworks (RBFNN), support vector machine (SVM), andMahalanobis distance classifier. We evaluated the performanceof these methods by means of a tenfold cross validationprotocol. Experimental results show that the SVMclassifier achieved higher average performance than allother classifiers in terms of overall accuracy, G-mean, andarea under the curve of the receiver operating characteristicplot. The SVM classifier achieved higher performancemeasures than the majority of the other classifiers also interms of sensitivity, specificity, and F-measure statistics.The LDA, k-NN and RT achieved the highest averageprecision. The RBFNN method yielded the highestF-measure.; however, it performed poorly in terms of otherperformance metrics. Finally, t tests were performed toevaluate statistical significance of the results, confirmingthat the SVM outperformed most of the other classifiers onthe majority of performance measures.

Micro-computed tomographic evaluation of canal retreatments performed by undergraduate students using different techniques,2018,"['Endodontics', 'Retreatment', 'X-ray microtomography']",,"Objectives This study evaluated the amount of remaining root canal filling materials after retreatment procedures performed by undergraduate students using manual, rotary, and reciprocating techniques through micro-computed tomographic analysis. The incidence of instrument fracture and the instrumentation time were also evaluated.Materials and Methods Thirty maxillary single rooted teeth were prepared with Reciproc R25 files and filled with gutta-percha and AH Plus sealer by the continuous wave of condensation technique. Then, the specimens were assigned to 3 groups (n = 10), according to the retreatment technique used: manual, rotary, and reciprocating groups, which used K-file, Mtwo retreatment file, and Reciproc file, respectively. Retreatments were performed by undergraduate students. The sample was scanned after root canal filling and retreatment procedures, and the images of the canals were examined to quantify the amount of remaining filling material. The incidence of instrument fracture and the instrumentation time were recorded.Results Remaining filling material was observed in all specimens regardless of the technique used. The mean volume of remaining material was significantly lower in the Reciproc group than in the manual K-file and Mtwo retreatment groups (p < 0.05). The time required to achieve a satisfactory removal of canal filling material and refinement was significantly lower in the Mtwo retreatment and Reciproc groups (p < 0.05) when compared to the manual K-file group. No instrument fracture was observed in any of the groups.Conclusions Reciproc was the most effective instrument in the removal of canal fillings after retreatments performed by undergraduate students."
Validity and Reliability of the Korean Version of the Hyperthyroidism Symptom Scale,2018,"['Thyrotoxicosis', 'Hyperthyroidism symptom scale', 'Validity']",,"Background: Thyrotoxicosis is a common disease resulting from an excess of thyroid hormones, which affects many organ systems.The clinical symptoms and signs are relatively nonspecific and can vary depending on age, sex, comorbidities, and the durationand cause of the disease. Several symptom rating scales have been developed in an attempt to assess these symptoms objectivelyand have been applied to diagnosis or to evaluation of the response to treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the reliabilityand validity of the Korean version of the hyperthyroidism symptom scale (K-HSS).Methods: Twenty-eight thyrotoxic patients and 10 healthy subjects completed the K-HSS at baseline and after follow-up at SeoulNational University Bundang Hospital. The correlation between K-HSS scores and thyroid function was analyzed. K-HSS scoreswere compared between baseline and follow-up in patient and control groups. Cronbach’s α coefficient was calculated to demonstratethe internal consistency of K-HSS.Results: The mean age of the participants was 34.7±9.8 years and 13 (34.2%) were men. K-HSS scores demonstrated a significantpositive correlation with serum free thyroxine concentration and decreased significantly with improved thyroid function. K-HSSscores were highest in subclinically thyrotoxic subjects, lower in patients who were euthyroid after treatment, and lowest in the controlgroup at follow-up, but these differences were not significant. Cronbach’s α coefficient for the K-HSS was 0.86.Conclusion: The K-HSS is a reliable and valid instrument for evaluating symptoms of thyrotoxicosis in Korean patients."

The Influence of Hen Aging on Eggshell Ultrastructure and Shell Mineral Components,2018,"['aging', 'eggshell ultrastructure', 'eggshell components ions', 'chicken']",,"The eggshell, which is a complex and highly ordered structure, is very important factor for food safety and egg marketing. This study investigated the changes in eggshell structure and shell components in relationship to hen age. For this study, we examined the histological change of the endometrium of the 30-, 60-, and 72-wk-old commercial layers, and analyzed the ultrastructure and ionic composition of their eggshells. The results showed that histological deformation, fibrosis, atrophy and elimination of micro-villi in the uterus endometrium were found through microscopic observation that was associated with increasing hen age. Concentration of blood-ion components such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions did not change with age. Along with the results from the ultrastructure analysis of the eggshell, the palisade layer ratio and the density of mammillary knobs were significantly decreased in older hens. In addition, the type B mammillary knobs were frequently observed with increasing hen age. In the mineral element assay from the eggshell, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, S<sup>2-</sup> , and Co<sup>2+</sup> significantly decreased with increasing hen age, whereas Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and V<sup>2+</sup> significantly increased. Therefore, the damages of endometrial tissue inhibit the processes of ion transmission and the crystallization of eggshell formation, resulting in a large and non-uniform mammillary knob formation. This means the conditions of endometrial cells affect the formation of the eggshell structure. In conclusion, hen aging causes the weakness of the eggshell and degrades the eggshell quality."
Demographic and Survivorship Disparities in Non–muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer in the United States,2018,"['Risk', 'Urinary bladder neoplasms', 'Aged', 'Survival analysis']",,"Objectives: To examine survivorship disparities in demographic factors and risk status for non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), which accounts for more than 75% of all urinary bladder cancers, but is highly curable with early identification and treatment.Methods: We used the US National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries over a 19-year period (1988-2006) to examine survivorship disparities in age, sex, race/ethnicity, and marital status of patients and risk status classified by histologic grade, stage, size of tumor, and number of multiple primary tumors among NMIBC patients (n=29 326). We applied Kaplan- Meier (K-M) and Cox proportional hazard methods for survival analysis.Results: Among all urinary bladder cancer patients, the majority of NMIBCs were in male (74.1%), non-Latino white (86.7%), married (67.8%), and low-risk (37.6%) to intermediate-risk (44.8%) patients. The mean age was 68 years. Survivorship (in median life years) was highest for non-Latino white (5.4 years), married (5.4 years), and low-risk (5.7 years) patients (K-M analysis, p<0.001). We found significantly lower survivorship for elderly, male (female hazard ratio [HR], 0.96), Latino (HR, 1.20), and unmarried (married HR, 0.93) patients.Conclusions: Survivorship disparities were ubiquitous across age, sex, race/ethnicity, and marital status groups. Non-white, unmarried, and elderly patients had significantly shorter survivorship. The implications of these findings include the need for a heightened focus on health policy and more organized efforts to improve access to care in order to increase the chances of survival for all patients."

고추와 배추 재배지에서 요소분해효소 억제제 함유 원예용 비료 시용에따른 아산화질소 배출 저감 효과,2018,"['Horticultural Fertilizer', 'Mitigation', 'NBPT', 'Nitrous Oxide', 'Urease Inhibitor']",,"BACKGROUND: About 81% of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural land to the atmosphere is due to nitrogen (N) fertilizer application. Mitigation of N2O emissions can be more effective in controlling biochemical processes such as nitrification and denitrification in the soil rather than decreasing fertilizer application. The use of urease inhibitors is an effective way to improve N fertilizer efficiency and reduce N2O emissions. Several compounds act as urease inhibitors, but N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) has been used worldwide.METHODS AND RESULTS: Hot pepper and chinese cabbage were cultivated in five treatments: standard fertilizer of nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium(N-P-K, NP2O5- K2O: 22.5-11.2-14.9 kg/ha for hot pepper and N-P2O5-K2O: 32.0-7.8-19.8 kg/ha for chinese cabbage), no fertilizer, and NBPT-treated fertilizer of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 times of nitrogen basal application rate of the standard fertilizer, respectively in Gyeonggi-do Hwaseong-si for 2 years(2015-2016). According to application of NBPTtreated fertilizer in hot pepper and chinese cabbage, N2O emission decreased by 19-20% compared to that of the standard fertilizer plot.CONCLUSION: NBPT-treated fertilizer proved that N2O emissions decreased statistically significant in the same growth conditions as the standard fertilization in the hot pepper and chinese cabbage cultivated fields. It means that NBPT-treated fertilizer can be applied for N fertilizer efficiency and N2O emissions reduction."

초기 불교의 식생활과 현대 사회의 웰빙,2018,"['음식에서 분량 알기(bhojane mattan?n?ut?)', '요니소 마나시까라(yoniso m?nasik?ra)', '사띠·삼빠쟌나(sati-sampaj?n?n?a)', '중도(中道', 'majjhima-pa?ipad?)', '슬로푸드(slow food)', 'Moderation in Eating (bhojane mattan?n?ut?)', 'Wise Reflection (yoniso m?nasik?ra)', 'Mindfulness and Awareness (sati- sampaj?n?n?a)', 'The Middle Path (majjhima-pa?ipad?)', 'Slow Food']","이 논문은 초기 불교의 식생활을 오늘날 정신적·육체적 웰빙을 추구하는 현대인들에게 적용해보려는 시도이다. 붓다는 식생활에서 단식과 과식 사이의 중간적 입장을 취할 것을 강조하였다. 붓다는 단식이 신체를 학대하는 고행의 일환으로 보아서 단식을 승인하지 않았다. 그렇다고 해서 붓다는 과식을 칭찬하지도 않았다. 왜냐하면 그것은 감각적 쾌락에 탐닉하는 것이며, 신체적 졸림과 정신적 나태(thīna-middha)에 이른다고 보았기 때문이다. 그래서 단식과 과식이라는 식생활에서의 양 극단을 벗어난 중도적 입장이란 음식에서 분량 알기(bhojane mattaññutā)’이다. 초기 불교에 따르면, 물질(色, rūpa)로서의 음식은 중생을 욕계(欲界, kāmā-dhātu)에 얽어매는 오하분결(五下分結, pañca-orambhāgiyāni-saṃyojanāni)의 하나인 감각적 욕망(kāma-rāga)의 대상이 될 수 있다. 이러한 이유에서 붓다는 ‘무엇을 먹느냐’보다 ‘어떻게 먹느냐’를 훨씬 더 중요하게 여겼다. 올바른 식사 태도는 식사 직전의 요니소 마나시까라(yoniso manasikāra)와 식사하는 동안의 사띠·삼빠쟌나(sati-sampajāñña)에 의해서 생긴다. 식사하는 동안에 요니소 마나시까라는 “비구는 지혜롭게 숙고하면서 음식을 수용하며, 그것은 즐기기 위해서도 아니고 취하기 위해서도 아니며 치장하기 위해서도 아니며 단지 이 몸을 지탱하고 존속하고 잔인함을 쉬고 성스러운 삶을 잘 지키기 위해서이다.”라는 붓다의 조언에서 잘 나타난다. 한편 식사하는 동안에 사띠·삼빠쟌나가 없으면 혀에서 일어나는 즐거운 느낌(sukha-vedanā)을 알아차리지 못하여 빨리 먹게 되고 과식과 폭식으로 이어진다. 어떤 의미에서 초기 불교의 식생활은 우리가 음식을 먹을 때 온전히 나의 몸과 마음의 반응에 집중해서 먹는 ‘마인드풀 잇팅(mindful-eating)’이나, 지역 전통을 지키고, 건강한 음식, 맛의 음미, 느린 삶을 추구하는 ‘슬로푸드(slow food)’와도 일맥상통한다. 그러므로 우리는 초기 불교의 식생활은 비단 출가자뿐만 아니라 정신적·신체적 웰빙을 추구하는 현대인들에게도 적용시킬 수 있다고 자신 있게 말할 수 있다.","The present paper attempts to apply early Buddhist dietary practice into those who seek physical and mental well-being in contemporary society. The Buddha emphasized the middle position between fasting and over-eating in dietary practice. He did not approve fasting nor over-eating because the former was a kind of self-mortification and the latter was a kind of indulgence in sensual pleasure and generated sloth-and-torpor (thīna-middha). For the Buddha, both were not conductive to awakening. Therefore, the middle position between fasting and over-eating is moderation in eating (bhojane mattammutā). According to Early Buddhism, food as an materiality (rūpa) can be an object of sensual craving (kāma-rāga) which belongs to the five lower fetters (pamca-orambhāgiyāni-saṃyojanāni) tie us to the sensuous sphere (kāmādhātu). It is for this reason that ‘how to eat’ is more important than ‘what to eat’ in Early Buddhism. This attitude is comes about through wise attention (yoniso manasikāra) before taking food and mindfulness and awareness (sati-sampajāmma) while taking food. Wise attention (yoniso manasikāra) for taking food is shown in the Buddha’s admonition for monastics to take food neither for amusement nor for intoxication nor for the sake of physical beauty and attractiveness, but only for the endurance and continuance of his body, for ending discomfort, and for assisting the holy life. Eating without mindfulness and awareness (sati-sampajāmma) tends to eat fast without noticing pleasurable sensation (sukha-vedanā) on tongue, and thus leads to over-eating and gluttony. In a sense, the early Buddhist dietary practice is closely related to the modern concept of ‘mindful eating’ which means eating with the attention necessary for noticing and enjoying your food and ‘slow food movement’ which initially aims to defend regional traditions, good food, gastronomic pleasure and a slow pace of life.

It is often difficult to apply traditional statistical techniques to research using big data because of the vastness of the data and complexity of the relationships. Therefore, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques which can handle such problems is becoming popular.Classical machine learning techniques, such as k-means clustering, support vector machine, and decision tree are still efficient and useful for some research problems. The deep learning techniques, such as multi-layer perceptron, convolutional neural network, and recurrent neural network have been spotlighted by the success of deep belief networks and convolutional neural networks in solving various problems that are difficult to solve by conventional methods. The results of recent research using artificial intelligence techniques are comparable to human experts. This article introduces technologies that help researchers conduct medical research and understand previous literature in the era of AI."

In this paper, we integrate microarray data with biological network data using a modified PageRank algorithm to identify prognostic genes.We also predict the prognosis of patients with 6 cancer types (including breast carcinoma) using the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. Before we apply the modified PageRank, we separate samples by K-Means clustering to address the heterogeneity of cancer. The proposed algorithm showed better performance than traditional algorithms for prognosis. We were also able to identify cluster-specific biological processes using GO enrichment analysis."

We classified one-person households by consumer type based on dietary lifestyle and compared the differences in characteristics and satisfaction levels among the different types. We also tested the moderating effects of consumer competency on dietary life satisfaction levels in each type. Data were obtained on 570 one-person households from the 2016 Food Consumption Survey conducted by the Korea Rural Economic Institute. K-means cluster analysis and two-way analysis of variance were performed.Among the one-person households, there were four different types of dietary lifestyles: (1)the type that was passive and preferred small-packed foods(PS), (2)the type that was high- quality-oriented and health-oriented(HH), (3)the type that preferred eating-out, home meal replacement products, and lower-priced foods(HL), and (4)the type that was indifferent to the dietary life(ID). Differences in demographic characteristic, dietary characteristics, and dietary life satisfaction levels were statistically significant among the four consumer types. Households of the HH type had the highest nutritional intake and satisfaction levels. The ID type was the most vulnerable type with regard to eating habits, dietary satisfaction, and consumer competency. Also, we found that it was useful to focus on the PS and HL types in strengthening consumer competency to increase dietary satisfaction. The results of this study provide useful strategies for differentiated dietary improvement and enhancement of consumer competency to improve dietary life satisfaction, based on the understanding of dietary patterns and characteristics of one-person households."
Development of Data-Driven In-Situ Monitoring and Diagnosis System of Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) Process Based on Support Vector Machine Algorithm,2018,"['Additive manufacturing', 'Data-driven approach', 'Fused deposition modeling', 'Process monitoring and diagnosis', 'Software module', 'Support vector machine algorithm']",,"Fused deposition modeling (FDM), one of representative additive manufacturing (AM) technologies, has been widely used for fabricating functional parts with geometrical complexity. However, it has suffered from degraded part quality and low process reliability and controllability. Therefore, it is of much significance to develop a monitoring and diagnosis system for the FDM process to overcome such drawbacks. In this paper, a data-driven FDM process monitoring and diagnosis system is developed by using two types of sensors – an accelerometer and an acoustic emission (AE) sensor. A large number of experimental data, collected from the accelerometers and AE sensor under healthy and faulty process states, are processed to obtain a critical feature – a root mean square (RMS). The RMS values are then used for training the FDM process monitoring and diagnosis models based on a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm and a k-fold cross validation approach. In particular, the SVM-based models for the odd- and even-numbered layers of one FDM specimen are developed. For a real-time validation in a factory floor, the non-linear SVM-based models using the acceleration signals are used for the software development. The diagnosis accuracy is better than 87.5%, and an applicability of the models is verified."

Experimental Study on the Permeability Characteristics of Sandstone in Different Chemical Solutions,2018,"['soft rock', 'experiment', 'permeability characteristics', 'water-rock interaction', 'seepage pressure']",,"Groundwater seepage is one of the important factors which affect the physical and mechanical properties of soft rock. In this study, the permeability evolution of sandstone was investigated using water solution seepage tests with different pH values. The results show that the chemical nature of the solutions has a great influence on the evolution of the permeability coefficients of sandstone specimens. Over time, it was determined that the permeability coefficient under the solution with PH = 2 was significantly greater than those under the PH = 7 and PH = 12 solutions used in this study. During the infiltrations, the ions of H+ and OH- which were involved in the water-rock interaction made the pH value of the solution change with different degrees. After the seepage, the ions in the solutions changed significantly. The ion concentrations seeping from sandstone specimen in the acidic solution, such as Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe3+ (Fe2+), Al3+ and K+, were found to be much greater than in the neutral and alkaline solutions. However, the ion concentrations seeping from sandstone specimen in the neutral solution displayed little differences from those in the alkaline solution. The concentration of the Si ion in the alkaline solution was much higher than those of the acid and neutral solutions, and the concentration of the acid solution was slightly higher than that of the neutral solution. The changes in the ion concentration in the osmotic solution reflected that there had been different forms of chemical reactions between the minerals of the sandstone and the solutions. The seepage pressures also had some effects on the permeability coefficients, pH values, and concentrations of ions in the solutions. After the seepage tests, the rock microstructures were observed by the means of a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM).The results show that some new holes have been formed in the sandstone specimen due to the seepage, especially in the sample with the acid solution. The internal structural changes of the sandstone are found to be the main reasons for the changes in the permeability coefficients."
An Approach to Differentiate Alzheimer’s Conditions using MR Image–based Zernike Moments and Fractal Features,2018,"['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Magnetic resonance images', 'Ventricle segmentation', 'Zernike moment shape descriptor', 'Fractal shape descriptor']",,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that affects a large population. The early detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can help to diagnose AD and assist in further treatment strategies. The morphological alterations of lateral ventricles and the corpus callosum are considered a significant imaging biomarker for the early diagnosis of MCI and AD. Shape-based features provide distinct morphological variations of brain structures during disease progression. In this research, an attempt has been made to analyze the variations of lateral ventricles and the corpus callosum using Zernike moments and fractal box count features. These shape features help to classify the morphological structure of lateral ventricles and the corpus callosum as control, MCI, and AD. The proposed method can quantify the shape variations using Zernike moments and fractal box count features. Here, Zernike moments and fractal box count measures show differences in mean values for control, MCI, and AD subjects with a statistical significance of p<0.05. Performance is analyzed using multilayer perceptron, K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and linear support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Linear SVM provides better differentiation for controls vs. MCI and controls vs. AD on the order of 93% and 98%, respectively. Results show that the classification of shape descriptors performs better with respect to accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity measures. Therefore, this study is clinically important for the early diagnosis of AD."

But this technique has a very low convergence, needs a lot of iterations to get solution of considering problems and therefore a lot of time for processing even on modern multi-core computers and clusters. Tchebychev iteration technique is well-known in Numerical Linear Algebra as an attractive candidate to decrease the number of iterations in Machine Learning iteration algorithms and also to decrease the running time of these algorithms those is very important especially in run time applications.

This creates incentives to avoid negative OCF through OCF management.The main findings of this study are summarized as follows. First, we observe an abnormal distribution of OCF around zero, which is analogous to that of earnings. Specifically, we find lower-than-expected frequencies of small negative OCF and higher-than-expected frequencies of small positive OCF. Second, we investigate specific means through which managers avoid negative OCF. Particularly, we focus on the adoption of K-IFRS which allows cash flows arising from the receipt/payment of interest or dividend to be classified as one of operating/investing/financing activities in accordance with their economic substance. We analyze whether firms use their discretion to avoid reporting negative OCF and find that firms engage in the opportunistic activity classification when negative OCF under the classification method of K-GAAP turns positive through the OCF maximizing classification method.This study contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence that firms have incentives to avoid negative OCF in addition to the incentives to avoid losses and that the discretion in the activity classification offered by K-IFRS can be exploited as a means to that end."

However, there is no current analysis of how the Korean social security system handles the multidimensional elderly poverty problem. Therefore, this study was conducted to examine whether there is a difference in the level of social security benefits depending on the type. The descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA, and crossover analysis were performed using the survey data of the elderly from 2014 in order to analyze the relationship between poverty characteristics of income, assets, labor, health, interpersonal relationship, social participation, and housing as well as public assistance, social insurance, and social service security characteristics. The main results are as follows.Multidimensional poverty types were classified into three deficiency types as a result of k-means cluster, group 1 (non-deficiency), group 2 (health+social participation deficiency) and group 3(overall deficiency) and were used to analyze the level of social security benefits. As a result, the characteristics of the use of social services by multidimensional poverty types were shown distinctively. Political and practical implications were derived by seeking a development strategy for the social security system reflecting this."

For this purpose, the data were collected through in-depth interviews during online and offline mentorings and through records of experiences of online meetings for preservice child care teachers and the meaning of those experiences were interpreted. The research question in this study is as follow. What are the experiences and those meanings of preservice child care teachers in online and offline mentorings? 5 preservice child care teachers who took a course of child care practice in K-university affiliated lifelong learning center, volunteered the participation in this study. They participated in 4-month online mentoring and 9-times offline mentoring from March to June, 2017. The offline mentoring was composed based on participants' needs and the researcher's suggestions. The results were found as two: 'online and offline mentoring experience for child care practice' and 'meaning of mentoring experience of oline and offline for child care practice'. The results of this study are as follows: First, the experience of online and offline mentoring for child care practice gave preservice teachers a chance to improve their professionalism while participating in mentoring. The participants reported their experiences: 'Mentoring, the beginning of eagerness'; 'Small droplets gather to make a big droplet'; 'I do not always walk the flowering route'; 'Going beyond limit together'; and 'Be smart and stand as the master of my life'. Second, the experience of online and offline mentoring for child care practice meant that they started to stand as a quality child care teacher through reflection and communication with the right view of teachers. The meaning of online and offline mentoring experience for child care practice were 'Lanterns revealed only to the prepared ones'; 'Reflection and maturity'; and 'Opening gate of communication beyond time and space'. In this study, it was found that all the preservice teachers could be together with researcher and could participate in emotional and professional support through online and offline mentoring beyond limitations of mentoring after child care practice, which played a helping role for effective child care practice. The online and offline metoring became a effective way for preservice teachers to participate in child care practice and to develop their personality and professionalism as a teacher in the future. In addition, the mentoring became a way in which mentors and mentees could communicate and cooperate together through reflection and maturity, because of emotional support."
Path Generation Method of UAV Autopilots using Max-Min Algorithm,2018,"['Autopilot', 'Max-Min Algorithm', 'Path Generation', 'Unmanned Aerial Vehicle']",,"In recent times, Natural User Interface/Natural User Experience (NUI/NUX) technology has foundwidespread application across a diverse range of fields and is also utilized for controlling unmanned aerialvehicles (UAVs). Even if the user controls the UAV by utilizing the NUI/NUX technology, it is difficult forthe user to easily control the UAV. The user needs an autopilot to easily control the UAV. The user needs aflight path to use the autopilot. The user sets the flight path based on the waypoints. UAVs normally flystraight from one waypoint to another. However, if flight between two waypoints is in a straight line, UAVsmay collide with obstacles. In order to solve collision problems, flight records can be utilized to adjust thegenerated path taking the locations of the obstacles into consideration. This paper proposes a natural pathgeneration method between waypoints based on flight records collected through UAVs flown by users.Bayesian probability is utilized to select paths most similar to the flight records to connect two waypoints.These paths are generated by selection of the center path corresponding to the highest Bayesian probability.While the K-means algorithm-based straight-line method generated paths that led to UAV collisions, theproposed method generates paths that allow UAVs to avoid obstacles."

Also, the shopping orientation of consumers has been proven to be an important determinant of consumer behavior. Therefore, the study investigated the differences in online WOM behavior based on shopping orientation. Hedonic, loyal, and syntonic styles were the types of shopping orientation considered, and the study focused on information retrieval tendencies, the motivation of online WOM search, searching online WOM sources, and the contents for the online WOM behavior. The research conducted an off-line survey targeting females in their twenties. The total number of data sets used in the empirical study was 125, and these were analyzed by SPSS 20.0: factors analysis, Cronbach’s α, k-means cluster, ANOVA, Duncan’s multiple range test, Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney, and Bonferroni correction. The participants were divided into 3 kinds of shopping orientation groups named 'trend-pursuit', 'passive', and 'loyal'. As a result, there were significant differences in online WOM behavior discovered between the groups. Firstly, the ‘trend-pursuit’ group had the highest number of ongoing searches while the ‘loyal’ group had the highest number of pre-purchase search. Secondly, the ‘trend-pursuit’ and ‘loyal’ groups both had the motivations of online WOM search, hedonic and utility, whereas the ‘passive’ group had the lowest motivations for both motivations. Thirdly, the 'loyal' group frequently referred to reviews on shopping malls as online WOM sources. The research provided a better understanding of the online WOM behavior of present consumers and suggests that fashion related corporations map out marketing strategies with the understanding of these behaviors."

A Scalable Feature Based Clustering Algorithm for Sequences with Many Distinct Items,2018,"['Sequence data', 'Feature-based clustering', 'Frequent sequential patterns']",,"Various sequence data have grown explosively in recent years. As more and more of such data become available, clustering is needed to understand the structure of sequence data. However, the existing clustering algorithms for sequence data are computationally demanding. To avoid such a problem, a feature-based clustering algorithm has been proposed. Notwithstanding that, the algorithm uses only a subset of all possible frequent sequential patterns as features, which may result in the distortion of similarities between sequences in practice, especially when dealing with sequence data with a large number of distinct items such as customer transaction data. Developed in this article is a feature-based clustering algorithm using a complete set of frequent sequential patterns as features for sequences of sets of items as well as sequences of single items which consist of many distinct items. The proposed algorithm projects sequence data into feature space whose dimension consists of a complete set of frequent sequential patterns, and then, employs K-means clustering algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm generates more meaningful clusters than the compared algorithms regardless of the dataset and parameters such as the minimum support value of frequent sequential patterns and the number of clusters considered. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can be applied to a large sequence database since it is linearly scalable to the number of sequence data."
Prospective Clinical Trial of Corneal Reconstruction With Biomaterial-Free Cultured Oral Mucosal Epithelial Cell Sheets,2018,,,"PURPOSE:: To investigate the efficacy and safety of transplantation with biomaterial-free cultured oral mucosal epithelial cell sheets (COMECs) for ocular reconstruction in subjects with total limbal stem cell deficiency. METHODS:: A prospective clinical trial (NCT02149732) was conducted in 8 subjects with total limbal stem cell deficiency after approval from the institutional review board of Seoul National University Hospital (H-0707-043-213) and the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety of Korea. COMECs were prepared in a culture system without the use of any temperature-sensitive polymers or carriers. The COMECs were transplanted without suture fixation. Four subjects underwent penetrating keratoplasty after stabilization of the COMEC transplant. Stable epithelialization, changes in visual acuity, and postoperative complications were evaluated for 6 months. Corneal cytokeratins (K) of 4 subjects who underwent penetrating keratoplasty were stained with an immunofluorescent agent. RESULTS:: The ocular surface was successfully reconstructed in 6 eyes. Complete stable epithelialization was achieved within a mean of 53.6 days. Visual improvement (≥2 lines) was achieved in 62.5% of the eyes. K12 (corneal phenotype), K4, and K13 (mucosal phenotype) were well expressed in grafts after keratoplasty, whereas K1, K8, and K19 were barely expressed. No ocular infections, local tumor formation, or remarkable systemic complications were observed. Ocular reconstruction using COMECs failed in 2 eyes, which had full symblepharon in 4 quadrants. CONCLUSIONS:: Transplanting biomaterial-free COMECs seems to be an efficient and safe procedure to reconstruct the ocular surface in patients who are completely limbal stem cell deficient without a full symblepharon."
Accuracy of swimming wearable watches for estimating energy expenditure,2018,"['Wearable device', 'Swimming', 'Lap count', 'Stroke count', 'Energy expenditure']",,"With the recent installation of waterproof function on wearable watches, various sports activities including walking, running and even swimming are monitored. Commercially available swimming wearable watches automatically identified stroke type, swim distance, stroke counts and energy expenditure (EE). Although the accuracy of estimating EE of walking, bilking and activities of daily life on activity monitors have been evaluated, it has not been examined for swimming. Thus, the purpose of the study was to evaluate the accuracy of estimating EE for swimming wearable watches (Apple Watch S2, Apple and Garmin Finex 3HR, Garmin). A total of 78 swimmers aged 20-59 years (female: 48%) participated in the study. All the participants wore Apple and Garmin and completed a set of swimming protocol comprising various speeds (0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2 m/s). At each swimming speed they were asked to swim for four minutes. Lap counts, stroke counts and energy expenditure (EE) from the Apple and Garmin were evaluated with the criterion measures. Lap counts and stroke counts were directly counted by the research assistant. The portable respiratory gas analyzer (K4b2, Cosmed, Italy) and a swimming snorkel (Aqua Trainer Snorkel, Cosmed, Italy) was used as the criterion measure of EE. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of lap counting and stroke counts at various swimming speed were within 10% for Apple (lap counts: 0.5-6.1%, stroke counts: 6.2-9.3%) and about 20% for Garmin (lap counts: 0-20.6%, stroke counts: 6.8-17.6%). However, the MAPE of EE was higher for Apple (17.1%-151.7%) than for Garmin (17.9%-32.7%). The accuracy of estimating EE tended to improve with increasing swimming speed for both Apple and Garmin. The EEs from Apple were outside the equivalence zone except for at 1.2 m/s and were overestimated compared to the criteria. On the other hand, EEs from Garmin were within the equivalence zone at all speeds except for 1.2 m/s. In conclusion, Apple and Garmin wearable watches accurately measure lap counts and stroke counts. However, the accuracy of estimating EE are poor at slow to medium swimming speed. Further improvement is needed to estimate energy expenditure of swimming at various speed."
Lung Function Trajectory Types in Never-Smoking Adults With Asthma: Clinical Features and Inflammatory Patterns,2018,"['Adult', 'asthma', 'disease progression', 'forced expiratory volume', 'inflammation', 'phenotype']",,"Purpose: Asthma is a heterogeneous disease that responds to medications to varying degrees. Cluster analyses have identified several phenotypes and variables related to fixed airway obstruction; however, few longitudinal studies of lung function have been performed on adult asthmatics. We investigated clinical, demographic, and inflammatory factors related to persistent airflow limitation based on lung function trajectories over 1 year.Methods: Serial post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume (FEV) 1% values were obtained from 1,679 asthmatics who were followed up every 3 months for 1 year. First, a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using Ward's method to generate a dendrogram for the optimum number of clusters using the complete post-FEV1 sets from 448 subjects. Then, a trajectory cluster analysis of serial post-FEV1 sets was performed using the k-means clustering for the longitudinal data trajectory method. Next, trajectory clustering for the serial post-FEV1 sets of a total of 1,679 asthmatics was performed after imputation of missing post-FEV1 values using regression methods.Results: Trajectories 1 and 2 were associated with normal lung function during the study period, and trajectory 3 was associated with a reversal to normal of the moderately decreased baseline FEV1 within 3 months. Trajectories 4 and 5 were associated with severe asthma with a marked reduction in baseline FEV1. However, the FEV1 associated with trajectory 4 was increased at 3 months, whereas the FEV1 associated with trajectory 5 was persistently disturbed over 1 year. Compared with trajectory 4, trajectory 5 was associated with older asthmatics with less atopy, a lower immunoglobulin E (IgE) level, sputum neutrophilia and higher dosages of oral steroids. In contrast, trajectory 4 was associated with higher sputum and blood eosinophil counts and more frequent exacerbations.Conclusions: Trajectory clustering analysis of FEV1 identified 5 distinct types, representing well-preserved to severely decreased FEV1. Persistent airflow obstruction may be related to non-atopy, a low IgE level, and older age accompanied by neutrophilic inflammation and low baseline FEV1 levels."

Indian Buddhist narrative genres of Jātaka and Avādana refer to such practices as Bodhisattva’s heroic examples of abandoning the body. In East Asian countries and Vietnam, auto-cremation has been most commonly practiced among many forms of self-immolation to protest against persecution, or to pay homage to the Buddha. This act is not confined to Mahāyāna Buddhist world. There have been cases, if not many, of this striking forms of self-immolation in Theravāda Buddhist world these days. With this paper, I discuss Buddhist perspectives on self-immolation on the basis of Pāli canon and its commentaries. Firstly, as in the case of suicide, self-immolation cuts short his or her opportunity to attain liberation, before having made proper use of human life to its fullest potential. Secondly, self-immolation should be included in self-modification or asceticism because it causes extreme physical pains and even leads to death. As is well known, the Buddha does not consider the undertaking of austerities as a necessary prerequisites for liberation. Thirdly, self-immolation is an act motivated or urged by craving for non-existence (vibhava-taṇhā) and is rooted in personality-belief (sakkāya-diṭṭhi) or ego-belief (atta-diṭṭhi). Self-immolation is against self-love (attā-piya) or self-affection (atta-kāma) which is highly appreciated as a source for lovingkindness (mettā) towards other beings. Thus, I can safely say that self-immolation is not in keeping with the original teaching of the Buddha and that self-immolation cannot be recognized as heroic or noble by no means."
Female Body Shape Classifications and Their Significant Impact on Fabric Utilization,2018,"['Body shape clustering', 'Moore neighbor algorithm', 'Region prop function', 'PCA', 'Fabric utilization']",,"In apparel manufacturing, more than 50 % cost is consumed by the textile fabric. Therefore companies have significant apprehensions in the fabric utilization. It can result in more efficient and cost-effective in fabric utilization if they are related to different body shapes. The purpose of this study is to classify female body shapes and evaluate fabric utilization efficiency for each category of the body shape. To this end, three dimensional (3D) body scans are collected from 124 young female subjects. For the body shape analysis, 3D body scans are processed by using Moore neighbor algorithm and region prop function to perceive the outermost shell. Moreover, both front and side view of the scans is processed for data reduction using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering using K-Means ++. It has been observed through our analysis of a dataset that female bodies can be categorized into four body shapes, that is, oval shape, circle shape, triangle shape, and rectangle shape. It has also been observed that all four body shape categories exhibit dissimilar anthropometric size measures. The result implies that these body shapes have devoured different fabric utilization for the garments (fitted trouser and fitted shirt). It has been noted that in fitted trouser and fitted shirt the most effective is the rectangle shape (cluster 4) and the least is the circle shape (cluster 2) in the fabric consumption. Similarly, the fitted trousers utilize less fabric while the fitted shirts consume more fabric in all body shapes. These findings provide a better reference of fabric utilization and cost-effectiveness to the apparel manufacturers while producing garments for different categories of the body shape."
군집화 기법을 이용한 GIS 열화 패턴 연구,2018,"['Gas insulation switch (GIS)', 'Clustering', 'Partial discharge', 'Power equipment']",,"In recent years, increasing electricity use has led to considerable interest in green energy. In order to effectively supply, cut off, and operate an electric power system, many electric power facilities such as gas insulation switch (GIS), cable, and large substation facilities with higher densities are being developed to meet demand. However, because of the increased use of aging electric power facilities, safety problems are emerging. Electromagnetic wave and leakage current detection are mainly used as sensing methods to detect live-line partial discharges. Although electromagnetic sensors are excellent at providing an initial diagnosis and very reliable, it is difficult to precisely determine the fault point, while leakage current sensors require a connection to the ground line and are very vulnerable to line noise.

SWOT 분석을 통해 이들 국가의 내외부 환경에 대한 사 전 인식을 바탕으로 우리나라에 비해 저렴한 노동임금과 풍부 한 노동력을 보유하고 있고 지리적으로 유라시아 시장의 중심 부에 위치하여 향후 급변하는 남북의 철도시대를 대비한 중앙 아시아의 물류 허브의 역할을 수행할 수 있는 이들 지역에 지 금이나마 진출을 활성화해야 할 것이다. 또한, K-Pop, 드라마 등 한류문화의 유입으로 인한 한국제 품에 대한 선호도가 높으며 다양한 발전 정책으로 인해 시장 이 열려 있어 철저한 준비를 통한다면 무한한 기회가 될 것이며 상대적으로 높은 우리 기자재의 가격 경쟁력만 확보 된다 면 수출 가능성이 있을 것으로 예측된다.","Central Asia (Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan) is a hot and arid continental climate, with most areas (68%) consisting of barren vegetation, desert, and meadows. The main agricultural areas for crop production include irrigated farmland, non-irrigated farmland, grassland, prairie and mountain. We are experiencing climate change with recent climate variability increasing. Agriculture is one of major economic sectors and provides a means of livings for the rural population of Central Asia, especially the poor. In the past two decades, Central Asia has experienced a high population growth rate, with Kazakhstan at 16.8%, Uzbekistan at 34.5% and Kyrgyzstan at 28.4%. As a major industry, Kazakhstan has the largest share of exports of agricultural products followed by petroleum, mineral resources, steel, and chemicals. Uzbekistan is the fifth largest cotton exporter as well as the sixth largest cotton producer in the world. Kyrgyzstan exports ores, stones, cultured pearls, and minerals. These three countries are rich in mineral resources, agricultural products, and energy resources. However, not only do they have difficulties in economic development due to the weakness of logistics and industrial infrastructure, but they also have imperceptible cooperation and investment among countries due to insufficient research and development. Through this study, we will investigate national outlook, economic indicators, major agricultural products, import and export status, and agricultural technology cooperation status, and study how Korean agricultural industry advances into these countries through SWOT analysis. Through this, we hope to contribute to the basic data of Central Asian studies and cooperation and investment in agriculture in each country. In addition, in order to increase cooperative exchange and investment in these countries, we will prepare a Central Asia logistics hub for the rapidly changing interKorean railroad era."

For this purpose, I clarified the contents of āsavas and proposed methods to destruct them and, as a result, to lead people to the liberation. Specifically, I scrutinized the achievement of cetovimutti and paññāvimutti by insight of ariyasaccāni that is the way of destruction of āsavas in the system of cattāri ariyasaccāni.The four āsavas in the Pāli literature are in a corresponding relationship with the ten saṃyojanas removed at each stage of the saints; how to remove the saṃyojanas is the way to destroy the āsavas. Each āsava is destroyed by the achievement of jhāna and the insight of aniccaㆍdukkhaㆍanattā the way that is equal but different in its degrees. This way of destruction of āsavas is not only the content of ‘the insight of ariyasaccāni’ functioning in the destruction of each āsava but also the way of achieving the insight itself.The liberation in the system of cattāri ariyasaccāni is the emancipation from dukkha, pañcupādānakkhandhā, by destroying taṇhā which is the cause of dukkha. Taṇhā is destroyed by the insight of aniccaㆍdukkhaㆍanattā, following the achievement of the fourth jhāna, which means sammāsamādhi, the last factor of ariya aṭṭhaṅgika magga. This state that taṇhā is destroyed is cetovimutti. Since the destruction of taṇhā means the destruction of dukkha, Arahant’s cetovimutti is not different from the actual liberation in the cattāri ariyasaccāni. However, complete liberation is accomplished by achieving the insight of ariyasaccāni which is attained by that realization and destroying avijjā, that is, by achieving paññāvimutti. In this way, the liberation of Arahant is completed with the state of these two liberations."
1960년대 이어령 문학에 나타난 세대의식 연구,2018,"['이어령', '한국문학', '제3세대', '4.19세대', '환각의 다리', 'Lee Eoryeong', 'Korean Literature(Hankookmoonhak)', 'the Third Generation', '4.19 Generation', 'The Phantom Leg(Hwangakui-Dari)']","기존의 이어령 연구는 주로 1950년대 비평으로 그 대상을 한정하거나, 4.19 이후 저항문학의 종언 선언이나 불온시 논쟁에서의 온건성을 문제 삼고 있다. 또 에세이 연구 역시 지성과 교양에 방점을 둔 이어령의 에세이가 당대 청년들의 저항 동력을 정치성이 탈각된 문화적 순치의 방향으로 이끌고 갔다고 평하고 있다. 그러나 1960년대 이어령의 비평가·편집자로서의 활동, 에세이·소설 창작 등의 문학활동을 검토해보면, 등단 당시 그 자신이 1950년대 문단의 주류에 반기를 들며 세대교체를 주장하고 나섰던 것과 마찬가지로, 4.19세대의 등장을 통한 문단의 세대 구도 재편을 모색하고 있음을 확인할 수 있다.신세대 주도의 문예지들 즉 『창작과비평』과 『산문시대』, 『68문학』 등이 등장하기 시작하던 1960년대 후반 이어령은 현암사 발행 『한국문학』을 창간하며 『창작과비평』과 함께 월간지 중심이었던 당대 문단 분위기의 쇄신을 이끈다. 이 잡지는 창간 당시부터 세대 담론을 적극적으로 개진하였다. 이어령은 제2세대, 즉 전후세대 문학인의 책무를 강조하는 한편, 다음 세대인 제3세대 문학인을 호명함으로써 한국문학의 세대교체를 기획하였다. 신세대 즉 제3세대 비평가 주도의 『창작과비평』과 나란히 제2세대 중심의 『한국문학』을 창간함으로써 당대의 월간지 중심, 문인 단체 중심의 구도를 계간지 중심, 세대 중심의 구도로 전환하였던 것이다.이와 같은 세대의식은 이어령의 소설 「환각의 다리」에도 드러나 있다. 이 소설은 대학생 주인공 사미와 K교수의 문학수업 장면을 통하여 당대의 세대 구도를 상징화하고 있으며 특히 전후세대의 관념성에 저항하고 자기 세대의 역사적 감각에 기반하여 텍스트를 주체적으로 읽어나가는 4.19세대 사미를 형상화함으로써 제3세대 문학·비평의 가능성을 그 핵심 주제로 제시하고 있다.","The existing researches on the Lee Eoryeong's literature in the 1960s criticized the declaration of the end of the resistance literature after 4.19 and the moderate position in the dispute with Kim Sooyoung. Studies on essays also point out that Lee’s essay focused on intelligence and cultural Buildung has neutralized the resistance movement of young people of the time. However, reconsidering his work as an editor, and rereading his creative activities such as columns, essays, and novels, one can confirm that Lee, who argued against the literary mainstream of the 1950s, is seeking a reformation of the literary generations again after 4.19.In the late 1960s, when the literary magazines of new generation, such as Creation and Criticism(Changjakwabipyeong) began to appear, leading the reform of the literary atmosphere with the quaterly magazine system, the first issue of Korean literature(Hankookmoonhak, Hyeonam publisher) was published. The magazine has leaded generation discourse since its first publication.Lee understood this period as the proper time of generational shift in Korean literature. He wanted to seek a change in Korean literature by naming the next generation as the third generation after liberation of Korea, while setting up a new mission of degagement for the postwar generation(the second generation) of writers. And by launching the Korean literature as a center of the postwar generation, he wanted to make a change the magazine system and shift the literary field from structure of the group to the structure of the generation. the overcoming of shamanism and nihilism, which was set by Lee as the goal of the third generation literature, meant the overcoming the first and second generations' literatures.Such a view on the generations is also revealed in Lee’s novel, “the Phantom Leg(Hwangakui-Dari).” The novel, which shows the structure of the contemporary generation through the relationship between the main character Sami and the professor K, focuses on the possibility of a new generation of literature, or the third-generations’ literature, represented through the Sami."

Scale development was comprised of two stages. The first stage is the theoretical studies of researchers and it selected the HRM features ofKorean companies needing assertive management related to the major factors. In the second stage, group discussions were held with working-level employees of HR organizations of Korean companies focusing mainly on the contents sorted through the theoretical reviews to develop the detailed scales for each of the final factors. Thedeveloped scales were divided into seven factors such as leadership, human resources, processes, strategy, customer/market, environmental response, and performance. For each individual factor, 3-4 sub-factors were included and for each of the sub-factors, scales comprised of three questions were developed. In addition, the Korean companies were categorized as manufacturing and non-manufacturing (service) businesses to check thestatistical significance level of the developed scale through empirical analyses on the surveys. Furthermore, based on the results of the empirical analyses, discussions were held on the qualitative/practical utilization of the developed scales, as well as the meaning of the research, future research projects, and directions for improving thedeveloped scale."

Sipjipum 十地品), in the Collection of Annotations of Avatamsaka Sutra (K. Hwaeomsocho 華嚴疏鈔) in order to highlight the unique features and differences of their understandings of Buddhism. Earlier studies, such as an account by a Buddhist monk from the modern period, Park Han-young, have revealed that Yeondam and Inak had a distant relationship, in regard of the periodical surroundings of their times and their different views on Buddhism. But this study tries to suggest definite evidences of an academic interchange between them by examining their annotations on the Avatamsaka Sutra. Shown below is the three evidence of the contention. Firstly, only from Yeondam’s collection of annotations, Yumanggi (Ch. 遺忘記), explanatory diagrams (K. Gwado 科圖) are found. Secondly, the comments on the annotations of the Avatamsaka Sutra made by Seolpa, Yeondam, and Inak all have traces of amendments. Thirdly, the collections of annotations of Yeondam and Inak have dealt with the same issue but they explained it in a different manner. On the basis of these three evidences, it is possible to assume that they each made annotations on the Avatamsaka Sutra in different times and manners. Given the fact that the annotations from latter date added new explanations to its preceding writings, it is reasonable to understand that there were academic interchanges between the three monks. As a result of examinations on Yeondam and Inak’s annotations, the former seems to have pursued deeper understandings on the meaning of the Avatamsaka Sutra while the latter have aimed to conduct meticulous examinations. This study also tried to elucidate the difference of Yeondam and Inak’s understandings on the meaning of the Avatamsaka Sutra. As an example, about the meaning of a phrase “都無所得”, which is read as “there is nothing to gain”, from the Collection of Annotations of Avatamsaka Sutra, Yeondam tried to interpret those words from the perspective of Yogacara Thought, while Inak tried to read them in the relation with the Avatamsaka Study. Yeondam’s approach to deal with the issue on the basis of the phenomenal world and Inak’s approach to explain it from the view of fundamental world suggest their different Buddhist perception. This study examines only a small part of the two monks’ annotations on the Avatamsaka Sutra in order to highlight the differences in their thought. It is anticipated that more detailed analysis on the rest of their writings will reveal further distinctive features of their ideas on Buddhism."
바르뜨리하리의 행위(kriyā)와 존재(sattā) 개념,2018,"['문법학파', '바르뜨리하리', '『문장단어론』', '샥띠', '개별', '보편', '행위', '존재', 'Vaiy?kara?a', 'Bhart?hari', 'V?kyapad?ya', '?akti', 'Vyakti', 'J?ti', 'Kriy?', 'Satt?']","바르뜨리하리(Bhartṛhari)에 따르면 세계는 모든 것의 씨앗(질료인)인 유일자 샤브다브라흐만이 언어원리를 통하여 현현한 것이므로, 언어와 실재는 결코 분리되지 않는다. 그는 브라흐만의 일원성과 세계의 다양성이라는 모순을 해결하기 위하여 샥띠(śakti) 개념을 도입한다. 바이셰시까의 다원론적 실재인 6범주를 재정의하며 정립된 샥띠를 통하여, 브라흐만은 세계 다양성의 원인이 되면서도 동시에 자신의 일원성을 확보할 수 있게 된다.  바르뜨리하리는 그의 주저 『문장단어론』의 제3권인 “빠다깐다”에서 방향, 수단, 행위, 시간 등 네 가지의 주요 샥띠를 다룬다. 방향과 시간은 모든 행위를 추동하는 샥띠(동력인)이자 인식의 토대이지만, 유일자로부터 세계가 전개되게 하는 과정의 중심에는 항상 행위가 있다. 그러므로 행위에 대한 그의 이론은 필연적으로 존재론과 더불어 전개된다.  본고에서는 “빠다깐다”의 ‘행위편’에 기술된 내용을 중심으로 바르뜨리하리의 행위와 존재 개념을 다룬다. 먼저 행위의 정의, 인식, 표현을 검토하고, 이어 계사(繫辭)에 불과한 상태 동사 어근 √as가 모든 행위를 포괄하는 보편적 개념이 되는 과정을 검토한다. 그리고 √as의 추상 명사에 불과한 사따(sattā)가 최고의 보편 또는 최고의 존재의 의미를 갖게 되어, 브라흐만이라는 구체적 호칭을 대체하게 되는 근거도 분석한다. 이를 통하여 그의 행위론이 형이상학적 존재론으로 귀결되는 과정을 밝히고자 한다.","According to Bhartṛhari, the phenomenal world is manifested through the language principle of Śabdabrahman, the seed of everything (sarvabīja), so language and reality are never separate. He introduces the concept of śakti to solve the contradiction between the unity of Brahman and diversity of the world. Through Bhartṛhari’s redefinition of the six categories (padārtha) of Vaiśeṣika, Brahman can become a cause of world diversity and at the same time secure its own unity.  Bhartṛhari deals with four major śaktis, that is, direction (dik), means (sādhana), action (kriyā), and time (kāla), in the Padakāṇḍa, the third volume of his main work, Vākyapadīya. Direction and time are the basis of recognition, which is the driving force for all actions, but there is always action at the heart of the process of making the world evolve from the One. Therefore, his theory of action necessarily evolves with ontology.   In this paper, I focus on the contents of ‘Kriyāsamuddeśa’ of the Padakāṇḍa and Bhartṛhari’s concepts of action and being. First, I examine the definition, recognition, and expression of action, and then examine the process in which the verb root √as, which is only a copula, becomes a universal concept covering all acts. And I analyze the reason that sattā, which is only an abstract noun of √as, has the meaning of the Universal or Supreme Being, and substitutes the specific title of Brahman. Through these analyses, I intend to reveal the process in which Bhartṛhari’s theory of action results in a metaphysical ontology."
차명계좌를 이용한 비상장주식의 장외거래 시 명의신탁 증여의제 적용에 대한 소고,2018,"['nominal trust', 'deemed donation', 'unlisted stocks', 'off-board transactions', 'stockholders’ registry', '명의신탁', '증여의제', '비상장주식', '장외거래', '주주명부']","우리나라는 「상속세 및 증여세법」(‘상증세법’) 제45조의2에 따라 차명주식에 대해 증여세 과세를 하고 있다. 명의신탁 증여의제규정은 차명재산에 대한 규제를 세금으로 하는 것을 의미한다. 이 규정은 1974. 12. 21. 상속세법 개정 시 입법화된 후 조문위치 및 적용대상 자산을 비롯한 세부적인 적용요건의 변화를 거쳐 오늘날에 이르고 있다. 이 글에서는 명의신탁 증여의제규정과 관련하여 최근 실무에서 다툼이 되었던, 주식취득과 차명계좌가 결합되면서 나타난 주식 명의신탁 증여의제규정의 특수한 쟁점을 다루었다. 현재 상장주식에 대한 쟁점에 대해서는 대법원 판결은 나왔지만 비상장주식의 경우에는 대법원의 법해석이 나오지 않은 상태에서 종전 판례의 분석과 이러한 분석을 토대로 한 새로운 쟁점에 대한 해석론을 제시한다는 점에 이 글의 의의가 있다고 할 것이다. 본 연구는 종전의 학술지에 게재된 논문 및 학위논문, 대법원 및 헌법재판소의 판례 등 문헌조사를 토대로 한다.이 글에서는 자녀 명의로 증권계좌를 이용하여 주식투자를 하면서 보유하게 된 상장주식에 관하여 수회에 걸쳐 명의개서한 경우 최초 명의개서 이후 명의개서된 각 주식에 대해서도 증여의제가 되는지가 다투어진 대법원 2017. 2. 21. 선고 2011두10232 판결을 분석한 후, 비상장주식도 증권계좌를 통해 차명거래를 하는 경우 상장주식의 경우와 동일하게 명의신탁 증여의제에 대한 규정이 적용될 것인지에 대해 결론을 내렸다.실제 소유자가 차명 증권계좌를 이용하여 주식투자를 하면서 증권계좌들을 통하여 보유하게 된 상장주식으로서 실제 소유자가 아닌 명의자로 명의개서까지 한 경우 명의신탁 증여의제규정의 적용을 제한적으로 한 대법원 2017. 2. 21. 선고 2011두10232 판결의 결론은 타당하다. 다만 실제소유자와 명의자간 명의신탁의 합의를 제한된 범위내에서 인정하기 때문이라는 근거제시가 명확하지 않은 아쉬움이 있다.비상장주식의 경우에 점차 거래가 시장화되고 있는 상황으로 실질적으로 K-OTC를 통한 거래의 경우 상장주식과 동일한 명의신탁과 관련된 문제가 발생할 소지가 있다. 비상장주식의 증권계좌에 따른 거래시 명의신탁 증여의제의 적용여부는 상장주식의 경우와 다르지 않다고 할 것이다. 상장주식과 비상장주식의 세법상 취급이 양도소득세 등에서 나타나기는 하지만, 증권계좌를 통한 주식거래시 명의신탁 증여의제 적용여부에 대해 최초 취득한 주식이후 취득한 주식에 대해 합의요건 미충족으로 이를 부정하는 것은 비상장주식과 상장주식간 차이를 둘 필요가 없다. 결국 증권계좌를 개설하여 비상장주식 거래를 할 때 최초 취득한 주식의 매도대금이 차명 증권계좌에 있고 그 매도대금으로 다른 비상장주식을 취득한 경우 최초 취득한 비상장주식 이외의 비상장주식에 대해 명의신탁 증여의제규정이 적용되는지에 대해서는 적용부정설이 타당하다. 대법원 2017. 2. 21. 선고 2011두10232 판결의 결론과 합의요건의 제한적 해석의 필요성을 바탕으로 앞으로 비상장주식에 대한 판례 형성이 되어야 할 것이다.","In Korea a gift tax is levied on borrowed stocks according to “Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Law” Article 45, Paragraph 2. Nominal trust deemed gift regulations refer to regulating borrowed properties by means of tax. The regulation has been legalized up until now by way of changes in detailed application requirements including the location of articles and the asset which is the object of application since the Inheritance Law was amended on December 21, 1974. This study addresses special issues that have caused disputes in the field concerning various regulations of stock nominal trust donation that has emerged when stock acquisition and borrowed account have come together The current study is significant in that it comes up with the methodology of interpreting new issues based on an analysis of previous judicial precedents and new issues based on such analysis at a time when an interpretation of the law is not available as yet in the case of unlisted stocks while judicial decision is now available concerning the issue of listed stocks. The study is based on literature research including dissertations published in previous academic journals, dissertations for academic degrees, precedents by the Supreme Court and Constitutional Court and so forth.The study analyzes the judicial decision Supreme Court 2017.2.21, Announcement 2011DU10232, where it was at issue whether deemed donation applies to each of the stocks where the title was transferred after transfer of the title for the first time in case the title was transferred several times regarding listed stocks acquired while investing in stocks using securities account in the children’s name, and draws the conclusion with regard to whether regulations on nominal trust deemed donation are to apply.In case the actual owner has gone so far as to transfer the title of listed stocks he or she came to own while investing in stocks using borrowed securities accounts to a person other than the actual owner, the conclusion that the judicial decision of the Supreme Court 2017. 2. 21. Announcement 2011DU10232 drew that has limitedly applied the Regulation of name trust donation is valid. However, the conclusion leaves something to be desired in that the ground for the agreement on the nominal trust between the actual owner and the nominee has not been evidently presented.In case of a non-listed stock, where transactions are gradually being market-oriented, actually in the case of transactions via K-OTC, chances are that problems associated with nominal trust equal to listed stocks will arise. In the case of transactions according to securities account of unlisted stocks, whether nominal trust deemed donation applies would not differ from the case of listed stocks. Though the handling of listed and unlisted stocks in terms of tax laws shows itself in transfer income tax and so forth, denial of the stock acquired after the stocks initially acquired on the ground of failing to meet the requirement for consensus does not need to be differentiated between listed and unlisted stocks. Ultimately, when a securities account is opened and unlisted stock transactions are made, and in case the sale price of the stock initially acquired is entered in the borrowed securities account, and other unlisted stocks were acquired with the sale price, as to whether nominal trust donation regulations apply to unlisted stocks other than unlisted stocks initially acquired, “the application negation theory” is appropriate. A judicial precedent would have to be set concerning unlisted stocks based on the needs for restricted interpretation of the conclusion and requirements for consensus of Supreme Court 2017. 2. 21. Announcement 2011DU10232 judicial decision in the days to come."

The emotions induced by a particular color may differ among individuals, but many previous experiments, study papers, reports, and other literature support the hypothesis that color could have psychological effects.In visual media such as television and films, we can see numerous examples of psychological and symbolic interpretation of colors being perceived as a significant component of visual atmosphere production and used to form a dramatic atmosphere or imply a character’s emotional status of the narrative. Color expression in visual media has overcome many of its limitations through technological developments in both hardware and software dimensions, and it is now possible to display lively colors on screen. Furthermore, it is no longer difficult to select and apply colors on the computer graphics system. Nevertheless, it remains challenging for artists to select the best color that induces emotional reaction while being in line with the narrative of the clip from the enormous set of colors of the analog spectrum.The study of this paper aims to provide a reference basis for color selection contingent upon narratives for emotional expression of ocean scenes which frequently appear on video contents such as films, television programs, advertisements, and media arts. The sample selection of the colors is based on scenes of Disney’s animated film <Moana, 2016> which livelily expresses various emotions of the ocean even more than the reality. For color analysis, 195 emotional colors of the ocean are extracted based on the PAD model through the K-Mean Clustering method with three emotional groups: relaxation, pleasure, and excitement.This Study has led to a meaningful conclusion to analyze the ocean color characteristics affecting emotional change. This paper discusses emotional color expressions of the relaxed ocean, pleasant ocean, and excited ocean."

The stock price forecasting research is classified into structured data and unstructured data, and it is divided into technical analysis, fundamental analysis and media effect analysis in detail.  In the big data era, research on stock price prediction combining big data is actively underway. Based on a large number of data, stock prediction research mainly focuses on machine learning techniques. Especially, research methods that combine the effects of media are attracting attention recently, among which researches that analyze online news and utilize online news to forecast stock prices are becoming main.  Previous studies predicting stock prices through online news are mostly sentiment analysis of news, making different corpus for each company, and making a dictionary that predicts stock prices by recording responses according to the past stock price. Therefore, existing studies have examined the impact of online news on individual companies. For example, stock movements of Samsung Electronics are predicted with only online news of Samsung Electronics. In addition, a method of considering influences among highly relevant companies has also been studied recently. For example, stock movements of Samsung Electronics are predicted with news of Samsung Electronics and a highly related company like LG Electronics.These previous studies examine the effects of news of industrial sector with homogeneity on the individual company. In the previous studies, homogeneous industries are classified according to the Global Industrial Classification Standard. In other words, the existing studies were analyzed under the assumption that industries divided into Global Industrial Classification Standard have homogeneity.  However, existing studies have limitations in that they do not take into account influential companies with high relevance or reflect the existence of heterogeneity within the same Global Industrial Classification Standard sectors. As a result of our examining the various sectors, it can be seen that there are sectors that show the industrial sectors are not a homogeneous group. To overcome these limitations of existing studies that do not reflect heterogeneity, our study suggests a methodology that reflects the heterogeneous effects of the industrial sector that affect the stock price by applying k-means clustering. Multiple Kernel Learning is mainly used to integrate data with various characteristics. Multiple Kernel Learning has several kernels, each of which receives and predicts different data. To incorporate effects of target firm and its relevant firms simultaneously, we used Multiple Kernel Learning. Each kernel was assigned to predict stock prices with variables of financial news of the industrial group divided by the target firm, K-means cluster analysis.  In order to prove that the suggested methodology is appropriate, experiments were conducted through three years of online news and stock prices.  The results of this study are as follows. (1) We confirmed that the information of the industrial sectors related to target company also contains meaningful information to predict stock movements of target company and confirmed that machine learning algorithm has better predictive power when considering the news of the relevant companies and target company’s news together. (2) It is important to predict stock movements with varying number of clusters according to the level of homogeneity in the industrial sector. In other words, when stock prices are homogeneous in industrial sectors, it is important to use relational effect at the level of industry group without analyzing clusters or to use it in small number of clusters. When the stock price is heterogeneous in industry group, it is important to cluster them into groups.  This study has a"

Ihak 理學 C. lixue) as its ruling ideology. The learning of principle was also called the “learning of the Way”(K. Tohak 道學 C. daoxue). While the learning of principle is a value neutral concept used to explain all things by the principle, the learning of the Way is a concept that contains the logic of regarding other theories as heterodox teachings along with the strong sense of the lineage of the Way. The learning of the Way of Chosŏn has been mostly used as a term merely referring to meanings and principles focusing on practicality(義理實踐) of the Confucian scholars, including Kim Goeng-pil and Cho Kwang-jo. As the learning of the Way was introduced during the late Koryŏ period, however, the diverse usages of the term were found and moreover, its characteristics changed over a period of time.In the late 14th century the learning of the Way was used as a term indicating Cheng-Zhu learning from the Yuan dynasty or the learning of the principle itself. The learning of the Way focused on the way of study maintaining constant inquiry and study(道問學) and regulating the world(經世實踐). Especially the characteristics stood out as the logic of regarding Buddhism and Taoism as heterodox teachings. In the 15th century, the usage of the learning of the Way also based on classical studies and focused on the way of study maintaining constant inquiry and study(道問學) and regulating the world(經世實踐). The learning of the Way based on classical studies played a role as statecraft learning or ideology for rulers as well as literati. However, as hegemonic rulers like King Sejo or Prince Yŏnsan and corrupt political forces such as old meritorious elites emerged, it came to be difficult to rectify the society only with the learning of the Way valuing the classical studies based on the explication of the classics. Hence, from the late 15th century, the learning of the Way related to cultivate oneself(節義實踐) was advocated while the learning attitudes of honoring virtuous nature(尊德性), such as controlling the mind, nourishing inner nature, and abiding in reverence, were greatly encouraged. The learning of the Way was extended to the learning of the heart-mind (K. simhak 心學 C. xinxue), which was concerned with the cultivation of mind.Above all, the key point of the learning of the Way is carrying on the orthodox lineage of the Way. Among the scholars pursuing the learning of the principle in the late Koryŏ and early Chosŏn it was Yi Saek who was aware of the orthodox lineage of the Way. Yi Saek claimed the authenticity of the learning of principle from Yuan dynasty by putting Xu Heng on the rank of the orthodox lineage of the Way. The arguments on the orthodox lineage of the Way in the late Koryŏ and Early Chosŏn are divided into three categories: the argument on the shrine service to Chinese Confucian scholars, on the shrine service to Korean Confucian scholars, and on the Confucian scholars who were not served in the shrines. It is remarkable to note that opinions on the orthodox lineage of the Way were swayed by the social value of the time resulted in the incessant replacement of spirit tablets in the shrines.Arguments on the lineage of the Way in the late Koryŏ and early Chosŏn are characterized by the argument on the orthodox lineage of rulers and that of Confucian scholars. The argument on the orthodox lineage of rulers was an attempt to reestablish the royal lineage by the kings of Chosŏn, which was a state of the learning of the Way. This royal lineage was considered to have ceased since Emperor Wu of the Zhou dynasty. This was exposed in the idea proposed by Chŏng To-jŏn and Park ŭi-Jung. The argument on the orthodox lineage of Confucian scholars was the assertion that, after Confucius, the Way passed down to the Chinese literati was again transmitted to the Confucian scholars of Chosŏn. ..."
북한과 미국에 대한 중국의 입장:과거와 현재의 중국의 대 한반도 전략변화,2018,"['North Korea', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Nuclear Program', 'THAAD', 'Foreign Policy', '북한', '미국', '중국', '핵문제', '사드', '대외전략']","북한이 대륙간탄도미사일(ICBM)을 발사하고 ‘핵무력 완성’을 선언하자 동북아 정세가 다 시 격랑에 빠졌다. 작년 6차 핵실험과 ICBM급 시험 발사 도발은 시진핑 중국 주석의 대북 특사가 북한 설득에 실패하고, 미국은 북한을 테러지원국으로 재지정한 상황에서 벌어졌다. 핵 보유를 눈앞에 둔 북한이 미국은 물론 중국의 어떠한 협상·설득에도 응하지 않겠다며 ‘마 이 웨이’를 선언한 것이다. 레드 라인(red line)을 넘어 이미 레드 존(red zone)에 진입한 것 과 다름없다. 지금까지와는 다른 위기가 찾아오고 있는 것이다. 핵탄두 소형화 기술까지 확 보하면  동북아 안보지형을 근본적으로 바꿀 수 있는 게임 체인저(Game changer)가 될 것 이기 때문이다.1) 북한의 계속되는 도발을 두고 관련국들도 동상이몽이다. 미국의 트럼프 대통령은 무모하고 위험한 행동이라며 필요한 모든 조치를 취할 것을 경고했고 북한의 자금줄 을 차단할 실질적 방안이 계속 강구되고 있다. 세컨더리 보이콧(Secondary boycott)에 준하는 조치를 통한 중국 압박 카드도 숨어있다. 중국은 늘 그렇듯 북한에 유엔 안보리 결의를 준수와 긴장 조성 행위 자제를 촉구하면서 관련 각국이 냉정을 유지해야한다는 말만 되풀이 하고 있다. 북한의 도발을 보고도 오히려 사드 반대를 천명하는 등 북한의 도발을 미·중 관 계의 틀에서 사드 문제와 연계하려는 속셈을 숨기지 않고 있다. 북핵과 미사일을 중·미 관계 카드의 하나로 인식하는 단면을 보이는 것이다.핵심 사안인 북핵 문제는 점점 꼬이고 있다. 북핵 해결 방식을 둘러싸고 미·중간의 대립 이 지속되고 있고, 한·중 간에도 합의가 무색하게 사드 갈등이 가라앉지 않고 있다. 또 미국 은 중국에게 대북 원유공급 중단이나 무역 중단 등 초강력 대북 압박을 계속 주문하면서 군 사타격이 고려되고 있음을 끝없이 암시하고 있다. 한·미·중 세 나라가 모두 북한의 핵보유를 절대 용인할 수 없으며, 북핵 사태는 외교적 방식으로 해결돼야 한다는 점에서 이견이 없다. 그러나 접근 방식이 다르다. 미국은 최대의 압박으로 북한의 생각을 바꿔야 한다는 입장이 며, 한국 정부는 이를 협상으로 이끄는 수단으로 이해하면서 일차적으로 미국과 입장을 같 이하고 있다. 그러나 중국은 이러한 선제적 압박 방식으로는 북한을 설득할 수 없다면서 북 한의 핵·미사일 실험 중단과 한·미의 연합 군사훈련 중단이 동시에 진행돼야 한다는 쌍 중단 (雙中斷)을 주장한다. 한국 정부는 미국의 군사타격 논의에 대해 한반도에서의 전쟁 재발 절 대불가를 강력히 표명하고 있다. 중국의 쌍 중단 논의에 대해서도 자국 안보를 지키려는 합 법적 한·미 연합 군사훈련과 국제적 규범을 깨고 핵보유국이 되려는 북한의 불법행위는 결 코 교환할 수 없다는 논리로 수용을 거부하고 있다. 자칫 핵보유국 북한과 불안한 평화 사이 가 공존하는 매우 비상식적인 상황이 출현할 수도 있기 때문이다.분명한 것은 더 이상 과거와 같은 대북 인식과 북핵 불용·한반도 비핵화 등과 같은 표면적 수사(修辭)로는 북핵 문제의 해결 방향을 잡을 수 없다는 점이다. 미국에서는 북핵 완성 시 간이 3개월도 남지 않았다는 주장도 나온다. 북한 역시 한편으로는 중국의 영향력을 반감시 키려 러시아와의 밀착을 시도하면서, 방북한 유엔 사무차장과의 회담을 통해 각급 소통 정 례화에 합의하는 등 시간도 벌고 미국의 예봉도 피하려는 전략...","Northeast Asian region has been stirred again by North Korea launching an ICBM and declaring “the final stage for completing nuclear deterrence.” Last year, the situation where North Korea conducted the 6th nuclear test and made a nuclear provocation by test-launching an ICBM-grade rocket happened as China’s president Xi Jinping’s envoy failed to persuade North Korea and the U.S. designated a state sponsor of terrorism again. It means that North Korea declared to go “my way” without listening to any negotiation or persuasion of not only the U.S. but also China as it is facing completion of nuclear program. It is like crossing the red line and entering into the red zone. A completed different type of crises is coming. If North Korea secures the technology of miniaturizing nuclear warheads, it will be a game changer that can fundamentally change the security landscape in Northeast Asia. In the face of North Korea’s relentless provocation, concerned countries are taking it differently. U.S. President Donald Trump called North Korea’s provocation a reckless and dangerous action and warned North Korea that the U.S. would take all necessary measures to deal with it. There are continuous efforts to find practical ways to cut off source of North Korea’s funds. On the back side of such measures, President Trump is taking measures as strong as a secondary boycott to put pressure on China. As always, China keeps saying that North Korea should comply with the UN Security Council’s decisions and asking the regime to refrain from creating tension, and the concerned countries should stay calm. In front of North Korea’s provocation, China announced opposition to installation of the THAAD not hiding its purpose to bind North Korea’s provocation with the issue of installing the THAAD in the frame of the U.S.-China relationship. It shows an aspect of how China considers North Korean nuclear programs and missiles a card it can play with in the U.S.-China relationship.However, the key issue of North Korean nuclear program is getting more complicated. The U.S. and China are still arguing about how to resolve the problem of North Korean nuclear program, leading to ongoing conflict over the THAAD between South Korea and China negating the agreements between the two. In addition, the U.S. keeps requesting China to take measures super that strongly pressure North Korea including cutting oil supply to North Korea and stopping trade with it while relentlessly implying that the U.S. has been considering military attack on North Korea. South Korea, the U.S., and China has reached an agreement on the basic principle that North Korean nuclear program would never be allowed and the nuclear problem should be solved in a diplomatic way. But each country has a different approach to deal with this. The U.S. believes that it should change North Korea by putting maximum pressure on it and the South Korean administration regards this approach as a means to bring North Korea to the negotiation table, standing in line with the U.S. for the meantime. However, Chinabelieves that such a preemptive measure pressuring North Korea cannot convince it, arguing for “freeze for freeze” initiative that stops both North Korean nuclear missile tests and ROK-US Joint Military Exercise at the same time. The South Korean government is expressing its strong intension to absolutely prevent another war in the Korean peninsula against the military attack discussed by the U.S. In regards to China’s approach to the “freeze for freeze” initiative that stops both the U.S. and North Korea, South Korea has been avoiding taking China’s idea on the basis of the logic and principle that the legal ROK-US Joint Military Exercise for protecting national security cannot be exchanged with North Korea’s illegal attempt to become a nuclear power breaking the international norms. It is because such an idea may lead to a very preposterous situation where South K..."
디자인권의 간접침해 규정에 대한 검토,2018,"['디자인권', '직접침해', '간접침해', '수출', '속지주의', 'Design Right', 'Direct Infringement', 'Indirect Infringement', 'Export', 'Territoriality']","디자인권의 간접침해 규정은 직접침해의 예비 또는 방조행위를 일정한 요건하에 권리침해로 봄으로써 장래의 디자인권 침해에 대한 권리구제의 실효성을 높이기 위한 취지에서 특허법의 간접침해 규정을 참고하여 마련된 것이다. 1973년 개정 의장법에 이 규정이 도입된 후 특허법의 간접침해 규정과 대동소이한 내용을 유지해 오다가, 2011년 개정 디자인보호법에서 간접침해 행위에 ‘수출’이 추가되면서 특허법 규정과는 다르게 되었는데, 이와 같은 개정은 다음과 같은 점에서 문제가 있다고 보인다.우선 개정의 기초가 된 한ㆍEU FTA 협정문 제10.28조는 ‘등록디자인이 적용된 물품’의 수출을 규율하는 내용으로 디자인권의 직접침해에 관한 내용이므로, 협정문 내용을 반영하는 조치로는 등록디자인의 실시 행위에 ‘수출’을 포함하는 것으로 충분했을 것인데, 협정문 반영에 필요한 범위를 벗어나는 내용(간접침해 행위 등에 ‘수출’을 추가하는 것)에 대한 충분한 검토 없이 개정된 것이 아닌가 생각된다.또한, 특허권의 간접침해 사안에서 침해물건 해외 생산의 예비적 행위가 간접침해에 해당하지 않음을 분명히 한 대법원 2014다42110 판결에 비추어 보면, 간접침해 행위에 ‘수출’을 추가하는 것에 대해 속지주의 측면에서 충분한 검토가 필요한데 당시 국회 심사보고서에서는 이러한 논의를 아예 찾아볼 수 없어 적절한 개정이었는지 의문이 든다. 속지주의 측면에서 디자인보호법의 간접침해 규정을 특허법과 다르게 정할 이유가 없으므로, 특허법과 같이 디자인보호법도 간접침해 행위에서 ‘수출’을 삭제할 필요가 있다고 생각된다.한편 주요국의 간접침해 규정을 비교해 보면, 유럽의 경우 간접침해 규정이 없고, 우리나라 일본 미국의 경우 간접침해 규정은 있지만 간접침해가 문제되는 경우는 거의 없는 것으로 보인다. 그렇다면 간접침해 규정을 존치할 필요성이 있는지 의문이 들 수 있지만, 향후 3D 프린팅 활용에 의한 디자인권 침해의 확산에 대응하기 위해서는 간접침해 규정을 존치하되 간접침해 대상물을 확대하는 개정을 검토할 필요가 있다고 생각된다. 즉, 디자인권에 의해 보호되는 물품의 3D 데이터 배포행위가 간접침해에 해당하기 위해서는 3D 데이터가 간접침해 대상물에 해당해야 하는데, 현행 디자인보호법은 간접침해 대상물을 ‘물품’에 한정하고 있기 때문에 간접침해 인정은 곤란할 것이기 때문이다. 따라서 독일 영국 특허법상 간접침해 규정을 참고하여 간접침해 대상물을 ‘물품’에서 ‘수단’으로 확대함으로써 3D 데이터도 간접침해 대상물에 포함될 수 있도록 하고 그러한 수단을 제공하는 행위를 간접침해에 포함하는 방안을 검토해 볼 수 있을 것이다.","The indirect infringement provision of the Design Protection Act was enacted by referring to the analogous provision of the Patent Act in order to provide effective measures for threatened infringement by holding a person who assists in preparatory acts of direct infringement liable for infringement under certain circumstances. The indirect infringement provision, after being enacted in 1973, had little difference with that of the Patent Act until the Design Protection Act included ‘export’ in the provision in 2011. This article points out what is wrong with this amendment.First of all, Article 10.28 of the Korea-EU Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which was the basis of the 2011 amendment, is a direct infringement provision regulating the export of ‘products bearing or embodying the protected design.’ Although it may have been sufficient to include ‘export’ in the definition of ‘working’ of a design in Article 2, it seems that the Design Protection Act has been revised more than necessary to reflect the FTA agreement by adding ‘export’ as an indirect infringing act without in-depth analysis.In addition, the Supreme Court of Korea held in a patent infringement case that if a party who exports a product that has an exclusive infringing use but the product is only used abroad, the party is not liable for indirect infringement (Supreme Court Decision 2014Da42110 Decided July 23, 2015.). In view of this decision, adding ‘export’ as an indirect infringing act must be reviewed in-depth from the perspective of the territoriality. It is doubtful whether the revision was appropriate because it was not possible to find such a discussion in the National Assembly Standing Committee examination report at that time. Since there is no reason to differentiate between the Design Protection Act and the Patent Act from the perspective of the territoriality, it is necessary to remove ‘export’ from indirect infringing acts of the Design Protection Act.The indirect infringement regulations of design right are not the same between the countries. While Korea, Japan and the United States have the indirect infringement provision in the relevant Acts, there is no such provision in EU Community Design Regulation. Since relevant cases are rare, it would be doubtful whether to maintain the indirect infringement provision. However, in order to cope with the proliferation of design rights infringement by utilizing 3D printing in the future, it is necessary to figure out whether to expand the scope of object of the indirect infringement while maintaining the indirect infringement provision. Under the current provision, only ‘a product’ exclusively used for producing an article bearing or embodying the protected design is the object of the indirect infringement. Because a CAD file of an article protected by design right is not ‘a product’, the distribution of a CAD file is not an indirect infringement. Under the German and the U.K. Patent Acts, the object of the indirect infringement is not ‘a product’ but ‘a means’ which is interpreted to encompass not only physical products but also digitally processed data. It would be a solution to include ‘supplying a means exclusively used for producing an article bearing or embodying the protected design’ in the indirect infringement provision by referring to the relevant provisions of the German and the U.K. Patent Acts."

라마 이야기 전통에서 뜨리자따의 변모 양상과 다르마,2018,"['Rāma-kathā', 'Rākṣasa', 'Rākṣasī', 'Trijaṭā', 'Dharma', '라마 이야기', '락샤사', '락샤씨', '뜨리자따', '다르마']","본 논문은 라마 이야기(Rāma Kathā) 전통에서 락샤씨(Rākṣasī, ‘여성 락샤사(Rākṣasa)’) 뜨리자따(Trijaṭā)가 보여주는 존재 양식과 기능 및 역할의 변모 양상과 그 의미를 살피는 것을 목적으로 한다.라마 이야기는 다르마(dharma)의 이야기로, 다르마와 다르마가 아닌 것, 즉 아다르마(adharma, ‘비(非) 다르마’) 사이의 대립과 다르마의 승리를 그린다. 이때 라마(Rāma)는 다르마를, 라바나(Rāvaṇa)와 그의 수하에 있는 락샤사들은 아다르마를 각각 표상한다. 라마 이야기에는 여러 보조인물들이 등장하는데, 그 중에서 뜨리자따는 다르마를 아는 락샤씨다. 발미끼(Vālmīki)의 『라마야나』(Rāmāyaṇa)에서 뜨리자따는 납치되어 아쇼까 정원에 갇힌 씨따에게 라마의 승리를 예견한 꿈을 들려주고, 그녀를 괴롭히던 락샤씨들을 내쫓았다. 또한 전장에서 심한 상처를 입고 쓰러진 라마와 락슈마나(Lakṣmaṇa)가 죽었다고 생각하는 씨따가 마음을 다잡을 수 있게 이성적인 조언으로 그녀를 달랬다.후대 라마 이야기에서 뜨리자따는 종종 비비샤나(Vibhīṣaṇa)의 딸이나 누이로 등장한다. 이와 함께 그녀의 기능과 역할은 보다 확대되고, 다른 인물의 자리를 대신하기도 한다. 뜨리자따라는 인물 형상화 양상의 변화에는 다르마가 강력한 기제로 작용했다고 볼 수 있다. 다시 말해 락샤씨임에도 불구하고 다르마를 따른다는 뜨리자따의 역설적 특성을 뒷받침하기 위해 가장 다르마에 가까운 락샤사이자 뿔라스땨(Pulastya)의 후손인 비비샤나와의 관계성이 요구되었고, 그에 따라 자연스럽게 기능과 역할이 확대된 것이다.","The objective of this paper is to examine literary transformation of Rākṣasī Trijaṭā in Rāma-kathā Tradition and the interrelationship between it and dharma. Rāma-kathā, which literally means Rāma’s story, is the phrase by which scholars refer to the basic narrative of Rāma’s marriage, exile, and battle with Rāvaṇa. The theme of Rāma-kathā is dharma which is a key concept with multiple meanings in Indian thoughts. The main plot of Rāma-kathā is Rāma’s victory over Rāvaṇa; in other words, the victory of dharma over adharma. There are several minor characters in Rāma-kathā; among them Trijaṭā is a rākṣasī on the side of dharma.In Vālmīki’s Rāmāyaṇa, Trijaṭā reprehended rākṣasīs who were threatening and frightening Sītā; she then proceeded to tell them about her dream foreshadowing the fall of Rāvaṇa and the triumph of Rāma, and made them apologize to Sītā. The other intervention of Trijaṭā takes place after the first major incident of the war. Sītā along with Trijaṭā had been sent by Rāvaṇa to view the battlefield, where Rāma lay helpless. At this sight, Sītā began to lament piteously, and Trijaṭā put heart into her assuring her that Rāma were alive.Rāma-kathā has been handed down over centuries, across regions, and among different communities, by different types of media. Several cultural/linguistic groups in India have shared this story which became a symbol of national unity and integration. Rāma-kathā has been told hundreds of times in diverse ways; its diverse set of tellings is called ‘Rāma-kathā tradition’. Trijaṭā’s characterization has been changed in later Rāma-kathās. She is generally depicted as Vibhisana’s daughter or sister. Her function and role have been enlarged; sometimes have replaced other characters’. Dharma is a strong machinery of this literary transformation of Trijaṭā."

In the present study we developed and validated CPAS-K(Creative Product Assessment Scale-K) to investigate college students' everyday problem solving creativity. CPAS-K was developed through theoretical and experiential approach, and validated using empirical data of three different creative products collected from 436 adults. We split the data into two sets. One set of 300 observations was analyzed by exploratory factor analysis using ESEM(exploratory structural equation modeling), and the other set of 136 observations was analyzed by confirmatory factor analysis using MTMM(Multitrait-Multimethod) approach. Then, the total data were used in a multi-group analysis. exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses yielded two factors that were interpreted as Originality and Appropriateness/Resolution. As a result of the multi-group analysis, factor means of the three products were compared. There were some differences between factor means in the Originality and the Appropriateness/Resolution dimensions so that the degree of creativity of products could be differentiated. Finally, implications, limitations, and potential future research directions were discussed."

Feeding by the heterotrophic nanoflagellate <i>Katablepharis remigera</i> on algal prey and its nationwide distribution in Korea,2018,"['Feeding', 'Grazing', 'Growth', 'Harmful algal bloom', 'Ingestion', 'Red tide']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Heterotrophic nanoflagellates are ubiquitous in natural waters, and most heterotrophic nanoflagellates are known to grow on bacteria. Recently, the heterotrophic nanoflagellate <I>Katablepharis japonica</I> has been reported to be an effective predator of diverse toxic or harmful algal prey. To date, 7 <I>Katablepharis</I> species have been identified, and therefore important questions arise as to whether other <I>Katablepharis</I> species can feed on algal prey, and further whether the types of prey of other <I>Katablepharis</I> species differ from those of <I>K. japonica</I>. To answer these important questions, feeding by <I>Katablepharis remigera</I> on diverse algal prey was examined. Specific growth and ingestion rates of <I>K. remigera</I> feeding on the raphidophytes <I>Heterosigma akashiwo</I> and <I>Chattonella subsalsa</I> were determined. Furthermore, the abundance of <I>K. remigera</I> at 28 stations along the coastline of Korea from January 2015 to October 2017 was quantified using qPCR method and newly designed specific primer-probe sets. Among 25 potential algal prey tested, <I>K. remigera</I> fed on only <I>H. akashiwo</I> and <I>C. subsalsa</I>; however, it did not feed on a diatom, a prymnesiophyte, a prasinophyte, cryptophytes, dinoflagellates, <I>Mesodinium rubrum</I>, a mixotrophic ciliate, and another raphidophyte <I>Fibrocapsa japonica</I>. The number of prey types on which <I>K. remigera</I> could feed (2 species) was considerably smaller than that of <I>K. japonica</I> (14 species). With the increase in the mean prey concentration, the specific growth rates of <I>K. remigera</I> on <I>H. akashiwo</I> and <I>C. subsalsa</I> increased as well before becoming saturated. The maximum specific growth rates of <I>K. remigera</I> on <I>H. akashiwo</I> and <I>C. subsalsa</I> were 0.717 and 0.129 d<SUP>−1</SUP>, respectively. In addition, the maximum ingestion rates of <I>K. remigera</I> on <I>H. akashiwo</I> and <I>C. subsalsa</I> were 0.333 and 0.661 ng C predator<SUP>−1</SUP> d<SUP>−1</SUP> (3.33 and 0.23 cells predator<SUP>−1</SUP> d<SUP>−1</SUP>), respectively. The results of this study clearly indicate that <I>K. remigera</I> is an effective predator of 2 red tide-causing raphidophyte species, and additionally, the feeding activity of <I>K. remigera</I> differs greatly from that of <I>K. japonica</I>. The abundance of <I>K. remigera</I> was ≥0.1 cells mL<SUP>−1</SUP> at 24 stations located in the East, West, and South Sea of Korea. Thus, <I>K. remigera</I> has a nationwide distribution in Korea.

The purpose of this paper is to examine historical change pattern and predict the long-term supply-demand for lodging rooms in Seoul. The quantitative method is based on McIntosh & Goeldner’s(1995) model, using an empirical dataset with the hotel and other accommodations from 2007 to 2016. The primary results of research are briefly summarized as follows; First, change pattern of lodging rooms are gradually imbalanced between supply-demand in Seoul, after effects on special laws enforcement(2012). Second, the outlook of supply-demand for lodging rooms was quite different by alternative simulations. According to alt 1(min) with the restricted only hotel, supply-demand for rooms are well balanced in the next three years. But at the end of 2021, supply(75K) can’t meet rising demand(80K) that additional expansion(5K) will be needed to reach an equilibrium. Consequently, it means that most of the hotel rooms will have already full at the same time. In case of alt 2(max), supported various lodging types such as guesthouse, hostel, serviced residence, supply(98K) will continue to outpace demand(80K) until 2021. The gap between supply-demand for lodging room is roughly 17K, which has sufficient to meet the high demand because of the newly built project(16K). This situation facing over-supply can cause severe damage to sales performance in operation(e.g. drop in OCC, ADR level, and revenue loss. Finally, these findings imply that adjusting or total management of supply-demand is very important to seek market stability in the future. Also it can provide a useful solution regarding mismatch problem between supply-demand as well as development the systematic forecasting model for lodging market participants(policy maker, investor, owner, operator, user)."

Most outlier detection methods calculate an outlier score that indicates the extent to which a data sample is out of normal state and determine it to be an outlier when its outlier score is above a given threshold. However, since the range of an outlier score is different for each data and the outliers exist at a smaller ratio than the normal data, it is very difficult to determine the threshold value for an outlier score. Further, in an actual situation, it is not easy to acquire data including a sufficient amount of outliers available for learning. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based outlier detection method by constructing a model representing a normal data region using only normal data and performing binary classification of outliers and normal data for new data samples. Then, by dividing the given normal data into chunks, and constructing a clustering model for each chunk, we expand it to the ensemble method combining the decision by the models and apply it to the streaming data with dynamic changes. Experimental results using real data and artificial data show high performance of the proposed method."

The RANSAC uses Gaussian function to extract the parameters of straight or curved lane. The proposed RANSAC is different from the conventional one, in the following two aspects. One is the selection of sample with different probability depending on the distance between sample and camera. Another is the inlier sample score that assigns higher weights to samples near to camera.

Various cases in other countries imply that the success of an internet-only bank depends on securing a fixed range of customers and its capability to provide them with innovative and differentiated services. Moreover, as the level of information and communication technologies and the penetration rate of mobile devices are higher than ever, alliance with ICT companies is the key element to the success of an internet-only bank.Recently the first and the second internet-only bank of Korea, K Bank and Kakao Bank, launched their businesses. They look successful, for now, since not long after their opening they accomplished outstanding business performance, which drove commercial banks to increase their competitiveness. But the prospect is not bright enough. K Bank is struggling with raising capital. Their financial products are not differentiated from those of commercial banks. ICT companies cannot actively participate in operating the internet-only banks. This is partially due to applying the same regulatory scheme to internet-only banks as applied to commercial banks regardless of characteristics of internet-only banks. For the internet-only banks to overcome the limitations to which they are confronted, regulatory scheme for internet-only banks needs to be redesigned which includes alleviation of the principle of separation of financial and industrial capital for an internet-only bank and restriction of the banking activities permissible for them so that it should support the settlement and growth of internet-only banks."

The influence of urbanized areas on particulate matter concentration was lower compared to the influence of forests. This study provided evidence that the particulate matter concentration was lower for regions with higher ratios of forests, and subsequent studies are required to identify the role of green space to manage particulate matter concentration in cities."

In this regard, Ru and Co have been recently considered as attractive alternatives for next-generation interconnect materials because the significantly shorter electron mean free paths for Ru (6.6 nm) and Co (11.8 nm) have been predicted to lead to a dramatically reduced resistivity size effect, which may allow lower resistivity of these materials than Cu at sufficiently reduced interconnect dimensions despite their relatively high bulk resistivies. In this study, the impact of surface and grain boundary scattering for Ru and Co was assessed based on the Fuchs-Sondheimer surface scattering model and the Mayadas-Shatzkes grain boundary scattering model, first by fitting these models to the resistivity data reported in the literature and second by artificially varying the scattering parameters in the models. The results predict that the wire resistivities of Ru and Co will cross below that of Cu at wire-widths of 10-15 nm."

As a result of the cluster analysis of CCPFs by this methodology, it was found that the constituents related to the modal meaning could be bundled into [Cluster 1]－[Cluster 4] and constituents related to the aspectual meaning could be bundled into [Cluster 5]－[Cluster 8]."
Spiral-shaped SU-8 cantilevers for monitoring mechanical response of cardiomyocytes treated with cardiac drugs,2018,"['Spiral SU-8 cantilever', 'Cardiomyocytes', 'Contraction force', 'Drug assay']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>In this paper, a spiral-shaped SU-8 cantilever with biocompatibility was proposed to monitor the changes of cardiac contraction in response to injection of drug in real time. The cantilever comprises a thick quadrate body and a filmy spiral cantilever with micro-grooves and gold patterns on the top of its surface. The longitudinally patterned micro-grooves facilitate the aligned growth of cardiomyocytes in order to increase the contraction force. In addition, the spiral shape increases the cantilever’s effective length and decreases its spring constant, which means its bending displacement can be increased for the same force as compared to that observed in a conventional rectangular cantilever. The bending displacement of the spiral SU-8 cantilever induced by the contraction of cardiomyocytes can be precisely measured at the nanoscale using a homemade laser-based measurement system. The displacement in the spiral SU-8 cantilever without micro-grooves was much greater than that in the case of traditional rectangular SU-8 cantilevers. The displacement produced by the spiral cantilever with grooves is 240% greater than that without grooves. Following preliminary experiments, cardiac drugs including Verapamil, Quinidine, Lidocaine, E-4031, and Bay K 8644 were used to evaluate their side effects on cardiomyocytes. Quantitative analysis of measurements shows that not only Verapamil and Quinidine but also Lidocaine and E-4031 treatment can decrease the cell beating frequency, and both the Verapamil and Lidocaine treatment can decrease the cell contraction force. Furthermore, Bay K 8644 assay results indicate that it can decrease the contraction force and increase the beating frequency of cardiomyocytes.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  Spiral cantilever integrated with micro-grooves is proposed for a real time monitoring of cardiac contractibility. </LI> <LI>  Home-made measurement system is developed to precisely measure the contractibility of cardiomyocytes at the nanoscale. </LI> <LI>  Five different kind of drugs have been employed for the preliminary study of drug-induced cardiac toxicity. </LI> <LI>  Spiral cantilever arrays are expected to be applied as a new method to support for the drawbacks of conventional methods. </LI> </UL> </P>"
"The TOP-SCOPE Survey of <i>Planck</i> Galactic Cold Clumps: Survey Overview and Results of an Exemplar Source, PGCC G26.53+0.17",2018,,,"<P>The low dust temperatures (< 14 K) of Planck Galactic cold clumps (PGCCs) make them ideal targets to probe the initial conditions and very early phase of star formation. 'TOP-SCOPE' is a joint survey program targeting similar to 2000 PGCCs in J = 1-0 transitions of CO isotopologues and similar to 1000 PGCCs in 850 mu m continuum emission. The objective of the 'TOP-SCOPE' survey and the joint surveys (SMT 10 m, KVN 21 m, and NRO 45 m) is to statistically study the initial conditions occurring during star formation and the evolution of molecular clouds, across a wide range of environments. The observations, data analysis, and example science cases for these surveys are introduced with an exemplar source, PGCC G26.53+0.17 (G26), which is a filamentary infrared dark cloud (IRDC). The total mass, length, and mean line mass (M/L) of the G26 filament are similar to 6200 M-circle dot, similar to 12 pc, and similar to 500 M-circle dot pc(-1), respectively. Ten massive clumps, including eight starless ones, are found along the filament. The most massive clump as a whole may still be in global collapse, while its denser part seems to be undergoing expansion owing to outflow feedback. The fragmentation in the G26 filament from cloud scale to clump scale is in agreement with gravitational fragmentation of an isothermal, nonmagnetized, and turbulent supported cylinder. A bimodal behavior in dust emissivity spectral index (beta) distribution is found in G26, suggesting grain growth along the filament. The G26 filament may be formed owing to large-scale compression flows evidenced by the temperature and velocity gradients across its natal cloud.</P>"

As for “empathy” utterances, it seems that Japanese speakers are not affected by the style of utterance, while Korean learnersare significantly affected, as can be seen in the high perception rate of plain style.In the case of Japanese speakers’ “comprehension” utterances, the pitch varies greatly and the duration time is short, and in the case of “empathy” utterances, the pitch does not vary considerably and decreases gradually, and the duration time is long. Furthermore, if the pitch does not exhibit a systematized pattern but the duration time is reasonably long, the utterance tends to be interpreted as “empathy,”while if the duration time is not reasonably long, the perception rate is low. In the case of the variant of Japanese produced by Korean learners, a notable point of difference in pitch patterns from Japanese speakers’ utterances is observed in “comprehension,” but decrease in perception rates is not detected when the durationtime constraints are satisfied."

(ⅱ) The police authorities are generally subject to the same liabilities in tort as private individuals and bodies. Therefore, the police can come under a duty of care to prevent the occurrence of harm if he or she causes the harm, only insofar as the police could be reasonably expected to have foreseen. (ⅲ) Basically, the police authorities owe no duty of care toward individuals to prevent them from being harmed by the conduct of a third party. However, the police may owe a duty of care where the police create or increase a danger of harm which would not otherwise have existed, has assumed a responsibility for an individual’s safety on which the individual has relied, has assumed a status which controls the third party. (ⅳ) The public policy may be considered in determining whether to impose a duty of care on the police. For example, they include the risk of defensive administration or floodgates.

In the present army, the radar signal is classified according to the type of threat based on the library of the radar signal parameters mostly built by the preliminary investigation. However, since radar technology is continuously evolving and diversifying, it can not properly classify signals when applying this method to new threats or threat types that do not exist in existing libraries, thus limiting the choice of appropriate jamming techniques. Therefore, it is necessary to classify the signals so that the optimal jamming technique can be selected using only the parameter data of the radar signal that is different from the method using the existing threat library. In this study, we propose a method based on machine learning to cope with new threat signal form. The method classifies the signal corresponding the new jamming method for the new threat signal by learning the classifier composed of the hidden Markov model and the neural network using the existing library data."

Thermal Characterization of Alkali Treated Kenaf Fibers and Kenaf-Epoxy Composites,2018,"['Natural fiber composites', 'Kenaf fiber treatment', 'Thermal characterization', 'TET (transient electrothermal technique)', 'SEM (scanning electron microscopy)']",,"Chemical treatment of natural fibers is a well-defined means of mechanical property improvement in natural fiberreinforced composites. An understanding of mechanical and thermal properties in these media is essential for evaluating heat transfer, thermal degradation, and overall performance of these composites over their product lifetime. However, very little information is available illustrating the effect of such treatment on the thermal properties of kenaf composites. Also, no study to date has reported the thermal conductivity of individual kenaf fibers. This study reports the effects of fiber treatment (in 6 % NaOH) on thermal transport in unidirectionally oriented kenaf-epoxy composites and individual kenaf fibers. The effective thermal conductivities and thermal diffusivities of chemically treated fiber composites show a general increase over untreated fiber composites (0.210 to 0.232 W/m/K at 28 ℃, 0.206 to 0.234 W/m/K at 200 ℃). This improvement may be attributed to improved interfacial contact between the fibers and epoxy matrix shown in microstructural images after chemical treatment. The thermal conductivity of individual fibers was evaluated at room temperature using two techniques. Results from both techniques showed slight increases after chemical treatment (0.58±0.53 to 1.0±0.13 W/m/K and 1.2±0.54 to 1.6±0.28 W/m/K) but lacked statistical significance. Any improvement in surface crystallinity after chemical treatmentdoes not appear to affect overall fiber thermal conductivity. A better understanding of thermal transport in kenaf fibers and composites enables better estimation of the performance of these composites in different applications. Moreover, the thermal conductivities of individual fibers are useful in understanding the fiber’s contribution to conduction in different fiber reinforcement configurations."

Transport Velocity of Perilla Grain on Oscillating Sieve in Elliptical Motion,2018,"['Elliptical motion', 'Four-bar linkage', 'Throwing index', 'Screening', 'Thresher sieve']",,"Purpose: The objective of this study was to propose a formula for the theoretical grain mean transport velocities of an elliptically moving oscillator by modifying the grain mean transport velocity formula applied to linear motion and to compare the calculated values with the experimental values of grain mean transport velocity. Methods: The values of the throwing index ($K_v$) and the maximum horizontal velocities for various positions on the elliptical oscillator were obtained using kinematic analysis. To obtain the actual grain transport velocity, the mean transport velocities of perilla grains at six positions on the sieve surface were measured using a high-speed camera and compared with the theoretical values. The cam with an eccentric bearing on the oscillator was designed to be eccentric by 1.6 cm so that the lengths of the major axis of the elliptical motion were 3.2-3.6 cm. The material used in the experiments was perilla grain. Results: The experimental result was consistent with the theoretical value calculated using the proposed formula ($R^2$ is 0.80). It is considered that the angle difference between the maximum accelerations in the directions vertical and horizontal to the sieve has as much influence on the grain mean transport velocity as the value of Kv itself. Conclusions: It was possible to theoretically obtain the grain mean transport velocities through a screening device in elliptical motion by modifying the formula of the grain mean transport velocities used in linear motion."

Dietary Sodium to Potassium Ratio and the Incidence of Chronic Kidney Disease in Adults,2018,"['dietary sodium', 'dietary potassium', 'sodium to potassium ratio', 'chronic kidney disease']",,"The aim of this study was to explore the association of dietary sodium to potassium (Na/K) ratio and the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in general Iranian adults. In this prospective cohort study, 1,780 adults, free of baseline CKD with complete follow-up data, were selected from among participants of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study and followed for 6.3 years for development of CKD. Dietary sodium and potassium were assessed using a valid and reliable 168-item food frequency questionnaire. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation, and CKD was defined as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 ㎡. Mean dietary intakes of sodium and potassium were 4,547±3,703 and 3,753±1,485 mg/d, respectively, and their ratio was 1.35±1.29. No significant association was found between dietary intakes of sodium and potassium and the risk of CKD after 6.3 y of followup, whereas in the case of dietary Na/K ratio, participants in the highest compared to lowest tertile (2.43 vs 1.61) had a significantly increased risk of CKD (odds ratio＝1.52, 95% confidence interval＝1.01∼2.30); an increasing trend in the risk of CKD across tertiles of dietary sodium to potassium ratio was also observed (P for trend＝0.05). Present findings demonstrate that the dietary Na/K ratio is a stronger predictor of CKD than the dietary sodium or potassium per se. Decreased dietary Na/K ratio may be considered as an effective dietary approach to modify the risk of kidney dysfunction."

A comprehensive molecular dynamics study of a single polystyrene chain in a good solvent,2018,"['Polystyrene', 'Molecular characteristics', 'Toluene', 'Dilute solutions', 'Molecular dynamics simulation']",,"In this study, molecular characteristics of polystyrene (PS) was calculated measuring its dilute-solution properties in toluene at 288.15 K via molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The solution models consisted of PS chains with different number of repeating units all of which were in a dilute regime. In order to investigate the compatibility between the polymer and the solvent molecules, interaction energy and Flory-Huggins (FH) interaction parameter were estimated. The simulation results indicate that increasing the chain repeating units enhanced the interaction between the solute and the solvent. Additionally, the chain dimensions were evaluated calculating the radius of gyration (Rg) and end-to-end distance, r0. To determine the dynamic behavior of the chains in the solutions, mean square displacement (MSD) and diffusivity coefficient were calculated. The simulation results indicated that the chain rigidity at low molecular weight and chain flexibility with increasing the molecular weight influenced chains dynamic behavior and diffusivity. Moreover, radial distribution function (RDF) illustrated the effect of steric hindrance of the chains in dilute solution on capturing the solvent molecules. In addition, solution viscosity was calculated by performing non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation (NEMD). The obtained results of chain characteristics and viscosity showed a good agreement with experimental results published previously. This agreement confirms the accuracy of the applied simulation method to characterize the dilute solutions and the chains characteristics."

"Biomass, Primary Nutrient and Carbon Stock in a Sub-Himalayan Forest of West Bengal, India",2018,"['biomass', 'carbon storage', 'nutrient', 'litter', 'eastern himalayas']",,"Quantitative information on biomass and available nutrients are essential for developing sustainable forest management strategies to regulate atmospheric carbon. An attempt was made at Chilapatta Reserve Forest in Duars region of West Bengal to quantify its above and below ground carbon along with available “N”, “P” and “K” in the soil. Stratified random nested quadrats were marked for soil, biomass and litter sampling. Indirect or non-destructive procedures were employed for biomass estimation. The amount of these available nutrients and organic carbon quantified in soil indicates that the forest soil is high in organic carbon and available “K” and medium in phosphorus and nitrogen. The biomass, soil carbon and total carbon (soil C＋C in plant biomass) in the forest was 1,995.98, 75.83 and 973.65 Mg ha-1. More than 90% of the carbon accumulated in the forest was contributed by the trees. The annual litter production of the forest was 5.37 Mg ha-1. Carbon accumulation is intricately linked with site quality factors. The estimated biomass of 1,995.98 Mgㆍha-1 clearly indicates this. The site quality factor i.e. tropical moist deciduous with optimum availability of soil nutrients, heavy precipitation, high mean monthly relative humidity and optimum temperature range supported luxuriant growth which was realized as higher biomass accumulation and hence higher carbon accumulated."
Overexpression of TFF3 is involved in prostate carcinogenesis via blocking mitochondria-mediated apoptosis,2018,,,"The overexpression of trefoil factor family 3 (TFF3) is observed in a variety of cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa), and its potential role in carcinogenesis, such as activating the PI3K/AKT pathway, is suggested. However, its role and its related mechanisms in prostate tumorigenesis remain unknown. To elucidate the role of TFF3 overexpression in PCa, we silenced TFF3 in two PCa cell lines that overexpressed TFF3 and explored the molecular mechanism behind its antiapoptotic role. We also examined TFF3 expression in 108 Korean PCa specimens and 106 normal prostate tissues by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. The mean TFF3 IHC score in the tumor tissues was significantly higher than that in the normal tissues (4.702 vs. 0.311, P = 2.52 × 10-24). TFF3-silenced cells showed suppressed tumor cell growth and migration. TFF3 silencing decreased BCL2 and increased BAX expression. The translocation of BAX to the mitochondria was also confirmed. After TFF3 silencing, the expression of the mitochondrial proapoptotic proteins, cytochrome C and Smac/DIABLO, was elevated, and these proteins were released from the mitochondria to the cytosol. Downstream mediators of mitochondrial apoptosis, including cleaved caspase-3, caspase-9, and PARP, were also elevated. Accordingly, the proportion of apoptotic cells was significantly higher among TFF3-silenced cells.There was no difference in extrinsic apoptosis-related molecules after TFF3 silencing. All the results support that TFF3 silencing induces the downstream signaling pathway of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanism of prostate tumorigenesis, suggesting TFF3 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target of PCa."

Experimental and theoretical investigation of micellization behavior of sodium dodecyl sulfate with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide in aqueous/urea solution at various temperatures,2018,"['Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS)', 'Mixed Micelle', 'Interaction Parameter', 'Activity Coefficient', 'Thermodynamic Parameter']",,"Mixed micelle formation behavior of cationic surfactant-cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in aqueous as well as in urea medium from 303.15K to 323.15K at 5K interval was carried out by conductometric method. The differences between the experimental values of critical micelle concentrations (cmc) and ideal critical micelle concentrations (cmcid) illustrate the interaction between the amphiphiles studied. The values of micellar mole fraction (X1Rub (Rubingh), X1 M (Motomura), X1Rod (Rodenas) and X1 id (ideal) of surfactant CTAB determined by different proposed models and outcome indicate high involvement of CTAB in SDS-CTAB mixed micellization, which enhance by means of the augment of mole fraction of CTAB. The negative value of interaction parameter (  ) showed an attractive interaction involving CTAB and SDS. Activity coefficients were less than unity in all case, which also reveals the presence of interaction between CTAB & SDS. The negative G0 m values imply the spontaneous mixed micellization phenomenon. The attained values of H0 m were positive at inferior temperature, while negative at superior temperature. The negative H0 m values in urea (NH 2CONH2) medium illustrate exothermic micellization process. The magnitudes of S0 m were positive in almost all cases.

As a result, it was assumed that the text of Guyeokinwanggyeong(舊譯仁王經) was closer to the original text of Inwanggyeonso(仁王經疏, sutra-interpretation) rather than the Tripitaka Koreana version. Therefore In order to decrypt Seokdokgugyol(釋讀口訣) of the sutra tect in Guyeokinwanggyeong(舊譯仁王經), I tried to use the Inwanggyeonso(仁王經疏). In fact, I refer to the contents of Inwanggyeonso(仁王經疏) to discuss the difference between the meaning of ‘方’(方s) and ‘方’(方?) in the decoding of the Seokdokgugyol(釋讀口訣) in Guyeokinwanggyeong(舊譯仁王經). We discussed the possibility of that the meanings of the two letters are different. In addition, it is proved that gugyol letter ‘’ can be transcribed as a causative form ‘’(hʌyyə).  Second, it analyzed the form of time expressive grammatical expressions in the texts of the Seokdokgugyol(釋讀口訣) written in the Guyeokinwanggyeong(舊譯仁王經). Analyzed grammatical form from the sentences """", """", """" and """" And ‘--(-kə-)’ and ‘--(-nʌ-)’ respectively. And the function of this grammatical form is examined by analyzing the reading of the sentence. And the analysis of ‘--(-kə-)’ and ‘--(-nʌ-)’, ‘--(-nu-)’, ‘--(-no-)’ indicates that the speaker recognizes the events of ‘future’ and ‘present’."

Eight students from a 4-year K university and a 3-year C college were observed during their lessons and were interviewed. The results were as follows. The students wanted practical lessons that connect their experiences and concrete examples to internalize their learning from the lessons. In terms of methodology, they also wanted professional lessons that consist of various activities and lessons that require appropriate content and proper quantity of assignments. Such experience of lessons includes the meaning of the awareness of virtual reality, the exit of problem solving, the preparation and challenge as a process of preparation and growth to become an early childhood teacher. This study suggests the direction of lessons to train pre-service teachers before and after early childhood field practicum."

The future-oriented values of unification were dominant rather than the issue of anti-communism. The actual battle of the white horse is a battle in which the 9th Division of the ROK Armed Forces repulsed the Chinese army several times in the Cheolwon Baekmagoji in October 1952. The movie “Gojijeon” is a little out of the box, but it is the center of the battle between the Korean Army and the Chinese Army, but it is described as being the center of the Korean and Chinese forces. Also, the KSC (Korean Service Corps) mentioned above has little or no weight. It will be completed in the middle of the movie for a while. They were not remembered at the time, but many died.The meaning of ‘Aero-k highland’ means Korea as KOREA when AERO-K is reversed. The 14 bunkers of Aero-k highland should be interpreted as a space of communication through the fact that the National Defense Army and the People’s Army exchange goods. Until now, it has been interpreted as a space of confrontation with antagonism but it is not so when we look at the narrative of the movie. Rather, it is based on ideology on the upper line, but through this space, soldiers are communicating and exchanging. Although the pre-war song is a cinematic setting, the depth of the emotions felt by the people living with the common emotion of ‘mother’ in the atmosphere of the time would have been very different.Shin Il-young, who survived the war and returned to his hometown and parents’ arms, wrote for it, knocked down the enemy, and became a crocodile company captain, fired guns at other soldiers who wanted to abandon their platoon in Pohang battle.

"Comparison of Anterior, Posterior, and Total Corneal Astigmatism Measured Using a Single Scheimpflug Camera in Healthy and Keratoconus Eyes",2018,"['Astigmatism', 'Cornea', 'Keratoconus', 'posterior corneal astigmatism', 'total corneal astigmatism']",,"Purpose: To compare the effect of posterior corneal astigmatism on the estimation of total corneal astigmatism using anterior corneal measurements (simulated keratometry [K]) between eyes with keratoconus and healthy eyes. Methods: Thirty-three eyes of 33 patients with keratoconus of grade I or II and 33 eyes of 33 age- and sexmatched healthy control subjects were enrolled. Anterior, posterior, and total corneal cylinder powers and flat meridians measured by a single Scheimpflug camera were analyzed. The difference in corneal astigmatism between the simulated K and total cornea was evaluated. Results: The mean anterior, posterior, and total corneal cylinder powers of the keratoconus group (4.37 ± 1.73, 0.95 ± 0.39, and 4.36 ± 1.74 cylinder diopters [CD], respectively) were significantly greater than those of the control group (1.10 ± 0.68, 0.39 ± 0.18, and 0.97 ± 0.63 CD, respectively). The cylinder power difference between the simulated K and total cornea was positively correlated with the posterior corneal cylinder power and negatively correlated with the absolute flat meridian difference between the simulated K and total cornea in both groups. The mean magnitude of the vector difference between the astigmatism of the simulated K and total cornea of the keratoconus group (0.67 ± 0.67 CD) was significantly larger than that of the control group (0.28 ± 0.12 CD). Conclusions: Eyes with keratoconus had greater estimation errors of total corneal astigmatism based on anterior corneal measurement than did healthy eyes. Posterior corneal surface measurement should be more emphasized to determine the total corneal astigmatism in eyes with keratoconus."

"Biomass, Primary Nutrient and Carbon Stock in a Sub-Himalayan Forest of West Bengal, India",2018,"['biomass', 'carbon storage', 'nutrient', 'litter', 'eastern himalayas']",,"Quantitative information on biomass and available nutrients are essential for developing sustainable forest management strategies to regulate atmospheric carbon. An attempt was made at Chilapatta Reserve Forest in Duars region of West Bengal to quantify its above and below ground carbon along with available ""N"", ""P"" and ""K"" in the soil. Stratified random nested quadrats were marked for soil, biomass and litter sampling. Indirect or non-destructive procedures were employed for biomass estimation. The amount of these available nutrients and organic carbon quantified in soil indicates that the forest soil is high in organic carbon and available ""K"" and medium in phosphorus and nitrogen. The biomass, soil carbon and total carbon (soil C＋C in plant biomass) in the forest was 1,995.98, 75.83 and $973.65Mg\;ha^{-1}$. More than 90% of the carbon accumulated in the forest was contributed by the trees. The annual litter production of the forest was $5.37Mg\;ha^{-1}$. Carbon accumulation is intricately linked with site quality factors. The estimated biomass of $1,995.98Mg{\cdot}ha^{-1}$ clearly indicates this. The site quality factor i.e. tropical moist deciduous with optimum availability of soil nutrients, heavy precipitation, high mean monthly relative humidity and optimum temperature range supported luxuriant growth which was realized as higher biomass accumulation and hence higher carbon accumulated."

Thermodynamic properties (density, viscosity, refractive index and speed of sound) of DES1 and DES2 were determined in temperature range from 288.15K to 333.15K and at atmospheric pressure. Extraction ability of the investigated eutectics yielded promising results in comparison with conventional solvents. Besides a high selectivity towards ethanol, an advantage of DES2 is its lower viscosity and higher distribution ratio values, which is an important aspect for a potential industrial application. Another advantage of both investigated eutectics is their easy and high recoverability from the extract layer based on their negligible vapor pressure."
“Start Again” Vs. “End Again”: Breaking the Cycle of Violence in Pinter’s Ashes to Ashes,2018,"['start again', 'end again', 'the vicious cycle of violence', 'subject positions']",,"This essay examines the possibility of redemption and healing from the powerful presence of the Holocaust atrocity Harold Pinter offers through his female protagonist, Rebecca, in Ashes to Ashes. Postulating Devlin’s demand to have her “[k]iss [his] fist” as his attempt to perpetuate the vicious cycle of violence, this essay interprets Rebecca’s rejection of Devlin’s request as her struggle to stop the repetition and expansion of memories of atrocity in which she has been kept entrapped. Rebecca’s refusal to oblige Devlin with his request is a definitive moment in their power struggle in that she no longer needs to “start again” and thereby allow him to continue to instill a sense of guilt in her as a victim of sexual abuse. By resisting Devlin’s endeavor to circle back to the topic of her ex-lover and keep her recognizing the essentially mutable and versatile nature of her self, Rebecca manages to “end again” and begin to dictate the terms of her future existence. That Rebecca refuses to “start again” does not necessarily mean that she has the power to end once and for all. What she is really interested in is ending “again and again and again,” which means that she can take the subject position of a victim as well as other subject positions whenever and if necessary. Nonetheless, it does not have to happen on Devlin’s terms now that she has recognized that they “started . . . a long time ago.” From now on, they can break the “[l]ong silence” and start “end[ing] again” only when she wants to."
Validity and reliability of the Korean version of the Quality of Recovery-40 questionnaire,2018,"['Cross-cultural comparison', 'Korean', 'Postoperative recovery', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaire']",,"Background: The Quality of Recovery-40 (QoR-40) is a widely-used, self-rated, and self-completed questionnaire for postoperative patients. The questionnaire is intended to elicit information from each patient regarding the quality of recovery during the postoperative period. It is noteworthy, however, that an official Korean version of the QoR-40 (QoR- 40K) has not been established. The purpose of this study was to develop the QoR-40K by translation and cultural adaptation process and to evaluate the validity and reliability of the QoR-40K.Methods: After pre-authorization from the original author of the QoR-40, the translation procedure was established and carried out based upon Beaton’s recommendation to create a QoR-40K model comparable to the original English QoR- 40. Two hundred surgical patients were enrolled, and each completed the questionnaire during the preoperative period, on the third day, and 1 month after surgery. The QoR-40K was compared with the visual analogue scale (VAS) and another health-related questionnaire, the Short-form Health Survery-36 (SF-36). The method of validation for QoR-40K included test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and level of responsiveness.Results: Spearman’s correlation coefficient for test-retest reliability was 0.895 (P < 0.001), and Cronbach’s alpha of the global QoR-40K on the third day after surgery was 0.956. A positive correlation was obtained between the QoR-40K and the mental component summary of SF-36 (ρ = 0.474, P < 0.001), and a negative correlation was observed between QoR- 40K and VAS (ρ = −0.341, P < 0.001). The standardized responsive mean of the total QoR-40K was 0.71.Conclusions: The QoR-40K was found to be as acceptable and reliable as the original English QoR-40 for Korean patients after surgery, despite the apparent differences in the respective patients’ cultural backgrounds."

The education was guided by two professors of emergency medical technology, two Basic Iife Support instructors, and two emergency rescue directors. Pre-hospital BLS was measured by a 5-point Likert scale. Higher score means higher performance skills. The data were analyzed using SPSS/WIN 22.0 program set at significance level of p<05. The effect of simulation education was much more significant than the conventional education in BLS. The simulation education is very important and effective in improving the clinical performance skills of paramedics than the conventional education. The simulation education can provide the virtual environment of cardiac arrest to the paramedics. In conclusion, the simulation education can provide the effective teaching methods for various practice performance skills and solution by critical thinking in the paramedics and healthcare providers in the future."

It owes his originality of academic and calligraphic achievements largely to his revivalism in “Guwen/gomun(古文)” that can mean both “ancient style of writing” and “ancient script”. Heo Mok sought ideal “guwen/gomun” that was described in his literary theory as “ideal style of writing in ancient ages” and that was described in his graphonomical theory as “ideal type of script in ancient ages”. In his view, “ancient style of writing” in the remote past has the foremost value, but depreciated styles of writing in the near past are not necessarily excluded; in a similar way, however foremost the “ancient script” of ancient sages in the remote past is, the modified scripts in the near past can be utilized as models of secondary importance. His “gomun” theory described above were demonstrated in his practice of calligraphy that revealed its details in his manuscript seal script dictionaries. These dictionaries are core texts to understand the aspect of his effort to restore “ancient scripts”. Especially in Heo Mok’s Rhyme Dictionary of Ancient Scripts(古文韻律) he was focusing on the Zhou script (Zhouwen 籒文) that he mentioned in his graphonomical theory as secondary important script, and in practice he mainly adopted the Zhou scripts in Shuwen Jiezi(說文解字), a.k.a.

“Start Again” Vs. “End Again”: Breaking the Cycle of Violence in Pinter’s Ashes to Ashes,2018,"['start again', 'end again', 'the vicious cycle of violence', 'subject positions']",,"This essay examines the possibility of redemption and healing from the powerful presence of the Holocaust atrocity Harold Pinter offers through his female protagonist, Rebecca, in Ashes to Ashes. Postulating Devlin’s demand to have her “[k]iss [his] fist” as his attempt to perpetuate the vicious cycle of violence, this essay interprets Rebecca’s rejection of Devlin’s request as her struggle to stop the repetition and expansion of memories of atrocity in which she has been kept entrapped. Rebecca’s refusal to oblige Devlin with his request is a definitive moment in their power struggle in that she no longer needs to “start again” and thereby allow him to continue to instill a sense of guilt in her as a victim of sexual abuse. By resisting Devlin’s endeavor to circle back to the topic of her ex-lover and keep her recognizing the essentially mutable and versatile nature of her self, Rebecca manages to “end again” and begin to dictate the terms of her future existence. That Rebecca refuses to “start again” does not necessarily mean that she has the power to end once and for all. What she is really interested in is ending “again and again and again,” which means that she can take the subject position of a victim as well as other subject positions whenever and if necessary. Nonetheless, it does not have to happen on Devlin’s terms now that she has recognized that they “started . . . a long time ago.” From now on, they can break the “[l]ong silence” and start “end[ing] again” only when she wants to."

수도관 부식에 대한 잔류염소 농도 영향 및 부식제어 방안,2018,"['top water', 'corrosion', 'LI', 'Chlorine', 'calcium hydroxide']",,"Langelier Index (LI) is used as a tap water corrosiveness index. Residual chlorine in tap water induces corrosion inside water pipes. This study takes a deeper look into the effect of residual chlorine in water pipes. Comparison between tap waters of Y and K water treatment plant (WTP) shows that the LI index of K WTP is lower than that of Y. However, the corrosion rate of Y WTP is higher than that of K WTP. This means that the higher the concentration of residual chlorine in tap water, the higher the corrosion rate of pipe materials. When calcium hydroxide was added to tap water, the corrosiveness index was improved and thus the corrosion rate reduced. It is possible to increase the disinfection efficiency by increasing the duration of residual chlorine and suppressing the rust generation of water pipes and to supply minerals. A guideline for corrosion control with residual chlorine should be set up. The effects of residual chlorine should be included in the corrosiveness index of tap water."
Study on the Thermionic-Emission-Type Cs-Ion Source,2018,"['Thermionic emission', 'Cs$^+$ ion', '$', 'beta$-eucryptite', 'Decay constant']",,"A thermionic-emission-type Cs$^+$-ion source based on a $\beta$-eucryptite-like material was fabricated, and its emission characteristics were investigated. The results obtained by using a residual gas analyzer showed that the material had a small amount of outgassing in an ultra-high vacuum even at high source temperature. The estimated Cs$^+$ ion emission energy was 4.03 eV, meaning that Cs$^+$ ions could be easily emitted. The current density at the source surface was 0.46 A/m$^2$ $\sim$ 48 A/m$^2$, the temperature was 1173 K $\sim$ 1373 K, and the filament potential was 300 V. The halflives of this specimen were 2.31 $\times$ 10$^3$ min, 1.98 $\times$ 10$^2$ min and 2.77 $\times$ 10 min for filament temperatures of 1173 K, 1273 K and 1373 K, respectively, meaning that this material has a very long lifetime. The estimated decay time constant function is very useful for determining the ion beam current or the total dose in an ion implantation study. In conclusion, these results can be applied to various research fields, such as depth profiling and secondary-ion mass spectroscopy, and can be used to construct Cs$^+$ emitting devices with a simple structure."

Homogenization at a high pressure resulted in a smaller droplet size and narrower droplet size distribution. The D[4,3] (volume-weighted mean) and D[3,2] (surface-weighted mean) values of the emulsions decreased with an increase in the SFAE concentration. The flow properties of the emulsions homogenized with SFAE showed shear-thinning (n=0.21-0.46) behavior. The apparent viscosity (ηa,10) and consistency index (K) of the homogenized emulsions were lower than those of the control sample that is non-homogenized and without SFAE, and decreased with an increase in SFAE concentration. The storage modulus (G ) and loss modulus (G ) of all emulsions homogenized with SFAE were also lower than those of the control sample. The stability of all emulsions with SFAE did not show any significant change for 30 d at 5℃. However, the emulsions stored at 40℃ were unstable over the storage period. Therefore, the addition of SFAE enhanced the stability of dairy cream emulsions during storage at refrigeration temperature (5℃)."

The knitting time for the sample produced by the knitting process 1 was the shortest among the 4 different types of samples. It means that the knitting process 1 would have benefits of higher productivity if there is no yarn breakage during the knitting of the cable stitches. In the test for tensile strength, the samples produced by knitting processes 3 and 4 have tensile values of approximately 8~11% higher than the sample produced by knitting process 1. The test for elongation also shows that the samples produced by knitting processes 3 and 4 have up to 18% higher elongation values than the sample produced by knitting process 1. On the other hand, the stiffness test showed no significant difference between the 4 samples. This study is expected to increase the competitiveness of the local knitting industry as a result of providing basic data on the mechanical properties of special knitted stitches, such as cable stitches."

This study illustrates how rights to be forgotten is described in recent Google case in U.K. high court, and recently established GDPR(General Data Protection Regulation) in EU, and examines issues in perspective of financial burden of business regarding data protection. Through sketching how the enormous online business named Google faced legal attack, and thereby faced the disfavoring ruling illuminating a number of standards the business should consider in dealing with consumers’delisting requests, also how business should cope with financial burden in the dawn of GDPR which is expected to keep increasing, it is expected that this study can be a small footstep that business can refer in legal action regarding rights to be forgotten in the near future."
｢지도의 암실｣에 나타난 기독교 인유,2018,"['“The Dark Room of the Map”', 'christianity', 'theory of trinity', 'crucifixion', 'allusion']",,"The purpose of this thesis is to find a new way to access to Yi Sang’s second novel, “The Dark Room of the Map”. This novel has been regarded as a Gordian Knot in the field of Yi Sang’s literature. Though he looks like a patient suffering from schizophrenia because of the abnormal expressions in “The Dark Room of the Map”, he thoroughly intend to show a certain message. Thus, three characters(‘I’, Lee-sang, ‘K’) in the work doesn’t mean the crack of writer consciousness and it cannot be treated as the part of schizophrenia. Yi Sang designed three characters but they are actually the one. When we interpret this, we need to consider ‘Theory of Trinity’ in Christianity. It is because Yi Sang drew Jesus Christ’s image into his other literary works. The reason is associated with his poor growth environment. Yi Sang(Kim, Hae-gyeong) had to support his biological father, Young-chang who made Yi Sang adopted to Young-chang’s elder brother. Especially, “The Dark Room of the Map” includes an allusion associated with Crucifixion. The characters in the work indicate the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. He may have thought that Jesus Christ was in the same situation."

"Geochemistry of Late Carboniferous sedimentary rocks from the Zongwulong structural belt and adjacent areas, Qaidam Basin, China: implications for provenance and tectonic setting",2018,"['geochemistry', 'Zongwulong structural belt', 'Late Carboniferous', 'povenance', 'tectonic setting']",,"This paper documents the geochemistry of clastic sedimentary rocks from the Upper Carboniferous Zongwulong Group in the Zongwulong structural belt of the Qaidam Basin, NW China, in order to trace the sources of the sediments and to understand their tectonic settings at the time of deposition of the Zongwulong Group. Although the major elements differ among different samples, their low mean chemical index of alteration mean CIA = 51.04–64.79), plagioclase index of alteration (mean PIA = 51.41–69.54), and relatively high mean index of compositional variability (mean ICV = 1.18–1.56) indicate relatively low maturity and weak to moderate chemical weathering of their source. The Zr/Sc-Th/Sc diagram and relatively high mean ICV suggest that all sediments of Zongwulong Group have undergone no significant sediment recycling. All samples yield relatively high Al2O3/TiO2 ratios (16–27), strong LREE/HREE differentiation (mean LaN/YbN = 10.83–12.66), and obvious negative Eu anomalies (mean Eu/Eu* = 0.61–0.79). Combined with characteristic ratios (La/Sc, Th/Sc, Cr/Th, and Th/Co) and the provenance discriminant diagrams (Al2O3-(CaO* + Na2O)-K2O and Ni-TiO2), these results indicate felsic source rocks. Combined with the findings of previous studies, the representative values (La, Ce, ΣREE, V, Rb/Sr, Eu/Eu*, La/Sc, Th/Sc, and Zr/Th) and tectonic setting discriminants (SiO2-K2O/Na2O, Fe2O3 + MgO-Al2O3/SiO2, La/Sc-Ti/Zr, and Th-Sc-Zr/10) indicate that the Zongwulong Group sediments were deposited in a back-arc extensional basin behind the active continental margin-continental island arc tectonic setting."

다양한 지종의 모세관 현상에 의한 흡수도 동특성 평가,2018,"['Sizing degree', 'Klemm method', 'dynamics', 'water penetration', 'first order process model']",,"This study was conducted to elucidate and to model the dynamics of capillary rise of water in various papers using the Klemm method. Dynamics of water absorption by capillary rise in various papers such as fine paper, newsprint, tissues, and color paper were measured and the relationships between the Klemm method and other sizing test methods were evaluated. It was found that the dynamics of water absorption in paper by capillary rise can be modelled using the first order process model and thus the first order transfer function. The Klemm sizing degree had a high positive correlation (r=0.98) with the process gain K of the water absorption model while it has a negative correlation (r=-0.67) with the time constant τ, meaning that the transfer rate of water was faster when the height of water absorption was higher. Klemm sizing degree was highly influenced by bulk and ash content of paper, and contact angle of water on paper. Correlation coefficients between each sizing test methods were not so high, meaning that any sizing degree test method can not represent all methods and a proper testing method shall be selected considering the purpose of usage."
Correlation analysis between the karyotypes and phenotypic traits of Chinese cymbidium cultivars,2018,"['Chinese cymbidium', 'Karyotype parameter', 'Flower trait', 'Leaf trait', 'Correlation analysis', 'Cytotaxonomy']",,"Chinese cymbidium are a group of valuable ornamental plants that is formed by genetically distinct species. Currently, arobust Chinese cymbidium classification system, such as that based on cytotaxonomy, is lacking. To investigate the geneticvariation within Chinese cymbidium, we selected 28 individual Chinese cymbidium cultivars as experimental materialto perform karyotype analysis. The results showed that chromosome number among these 28 cultivars was constant anddiploid (i.e., 2n = 40). In addition, no satellite chromosomes were observed. The karyotypes were more symmetrical andconsisted mainly of 1B and 2B types with a small number of 2A and 2C types. Based on principal component analysis, thefive karyotype parameters with the highest classification values were screened, which revealed that the mean of long to shortarm ratio, the mean relative length of long arms, and the asymmetry coefficient of karyotypes (As.K.) were reliable parametersfor use in Chinese cymbidium cytotaxonomy. Cluster analysis of karyotype parameters successfully identified cultivarsof the bamboo petal, narcissus petal, and plum petal types, thus confirming the accuracy of the cytological classificationsystem. Furthermore, flower traits of Chinese cymbidium were strongly correlated with karyotype parameters. Overall, weconclude that karyotype parameters can provide valuable information for studies on the classification, identification, andgenetic diversity of Chinese cymbidium."

Comparative kinetic study of coal gasification with steam and CO2 in molten blast furnace slags,2018,"['Coal Gasification', 'Molten Blast Furnace Slag', 'Heat Carrier', 'Kinetic Analysis', 'Isothermal Thermo-gravimetric']",,"To make a comparison between coal gasification in molten blast furnace slag (MBFS) in different ambience and choose an appropriate agent to recover BF slag’s waste heat entirely, coal gasification with steam and CO2 in molten blast furnace slags was studied by isothermal thermo-gravimetric analysis. The effects of temperature and addition of MBFS were studied. Carbon conversion and reaction rate increased with increasing temperature and MBFS.Volumetric model (VM), shrinking core model (SCM), and diffusion model (DM) were applied to describe the coal gasification behavior of FX coal. The most appropriate model describing the coal gasification was SCM in steam ambience and VM in CO2 ambience, respectively. The reaction rate constant k(T) in CO2 ambience is greater than that in steam ambience, which means the gasification reactivity of coal in CO2 ambience is better than that in steam ambience.BF slag can effectively reduce the activation energy EA of coal gasification reaction in different ambiences. But, the difference of activation energies is not large in different ambiences. Based on the results of kinetic analysis including k(T) and EA calculated by the established model, CO2 was chosen to be the most appropriate agent."

A Constructional Analysis of Old English Nominal Compounds,2018,"['Old English nominal compounds', 'Construction Morphology', 'word-formation']",,"Analysis of Old English Compounds. English Language and Linguistics 24.3, 1-45. This study provides a constructional analysis of Old English (OE) nominal (N) compounds (8,034 in total) based on the theoretical framework of Construction Morphology (Booij 2010c). A constructional analysis gives the solution to overcome the limitation of a traditional descriptive analysis, which makes a dichotomous classification, ‘Endocentric’ and ‘Exocentric’. This study mainly shows two things. First, OE N compounds are seen as constructions with form and meaning, and hence the formal and semantic properties of both regular and idiosyncratic N compounds can be simply and straightforwardly specified by abstract schemas (templates). Second, with the notion of ‘Default Inheritance’, this study demonstrates that both schemas for regular and idiosyncratic N compounds inherit the default properties from the most abstract schema for OE N compounds ([[X] k [N] i ] Nj ↔ [SEM i with relation R to SEM k ] j ) at the top of the hierarchy: a default override of idiosyncratic compounds is allowed. As a result, a classification of OE N compounds can be made in a unified and simple way with an inheritance tree."
Development of Efficient Strategy for Square Peg-in-Hole Assembly Task,2018,"['Robotic assembly', 'Square peg-in-hole task', 'Error recovery', 'Blind search', 'Clustering algorithm']",,"In this paper, we present a dexterous gripper with an angle measurement system and efficient strategy for estimating a hole position from reaction force measurements in a square peg-in-hole task. The contact conditions between a square peg and hole have been analyzed to show that the redundancy in reaction force-moment relation around hole originated from contact conditions. In order to remove such redundancy in contact conditions, an angular error between a square peg and hole is first corrected with the help of the angle measurement system. Then, the positional error between them is identified by applying two clustering algorithms (K means algorithm and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) algorithm) to the reaction moment data obtained by the XY search. For grasping and manipulating a peg precisely, a 4-DOF dexterous gripper is designed, which consists of two fingers equipped with 6-axis force/torque sensor at fingertip. The extensive experiments using the proposed gripper with the angle measurement system demonstrate that during the square peg-in-hole task, the proposed strategy ensures the tact time of around 5 sec with the estimation accuracy of less than 0.35 mm and the deviation of less than 0.44 mm, respectively."

This article would seek alternative ways of sustainable economic cooperation in the future based on the experience of Pyeonghwa Motors. In this article, I will review the achievement of corporation management in North Korea based on the financial materials of Pyeonghwa Motors and suggest a strategy for progressive economic cooperation.As you know, private property of production means are not allowed at all in North Korea. Neither do businesses belong to individuals. Pyeonghwa Motors entered market in the early stages of this cooperation project. Many experts consider Pyeonghwa Motors’ management as a pilot business activity in North Korea which controls all economic factors and business through the planned economy. Of course, there were also some challenges. Party committee of N.K limits major decisions of corporate management such as employment and wages while interfering in management. Especially, the company could not maximize its expected profit by forcing the company to keep the unit price at its lowest level.Definitely, there are two sides in the condition that North Korean authorities’ intervention. North Korea applied tax burden of corporate very flexibly. Even though Pyeonghwa Motors started paying after the initial three year exemption period, but it has been applied a variety of preferred policies. It is the result of the Pyeonghwa Motors’ strategy that not only it entered the market of N.K’s preferred industries, also continued close cooperation with the authorities. In addition, there is a part of the cornerstone for development by getting exceptional consideration in selecting sites. There have been unusual experiments such as advertisement of corporate products for the first time in North Korea.However, North Korea on planned economy should ease the regulations to sustainable development. It is necessary to ensure the autonomy of management to maximize the effectiveness of corporate management and increase its expected profit. They should also prepare institutions guaranteed to produce financial materials and oversee corporate management strictly."
Performance Prediction of a Laser-guide Star Adaptive Optics System for a 1.6 m Telescope,2018,"['Adaptive optics', 'Atmospheric turbulence', 'Telescope', 'Strehl ratio']",,"We are currently investigating the feasibility of a 1.6 m telescope with a laser-guide star adaptive optics (AO) system. The telescope, if successfully commissioned, would be the first dedicated adaptive optics observatory in South Korea. The 1.6 m telescope is an f/13.6 Cassegrain telescope with a focal length of 21.7 m. This paper first reviews atmospheric seeing conditions measured over a year in 2014~2015 at the Bohyun Observatory, South Korea, which corresponds to an area from 11.6 to 21.6 cm within 95% probability with regard to the Fried parameter of 880 nm at a telescope pupil plane. We then derive principal seeing conditions such as the Fried parameter and Greenwood frequency for eight astronomical spectral bands (V/R/I/J/H/K/L/M centered at 0.55, 0.64, 0.79, 1.22, 1.65, 2.20, 3.55, and 4.77 μm). Then we propose an AO system with a laser guide star for the 1.6 m telescope based on the seeing conditions. The proposed AO system consists of a fast tip/tilt secondary mirror, a 17 × 17 deformable mirror, a 16 × 16 Shack-Hartmann sensor, and a sodium laser guide star (589.2 nm). The high order AO system is close-looped with 2 KHz sampling frequency while the tip/tilt mirror is independently close-looped with 63 Hz sampling frequency. The AO system has three operational concepts: 1) bright target observation with its own wavefront sensing, 2) less bright star observation with wavefront sensing from another bright natural guide star (NGS), and 3) faint target observation with tip/tilt sensing from a bright natural guide star and wavefront sensing from a laser guide star. We name these three concepts ‘None’, ‘NGS only’, and ‘LGS + NGS’, respectively. Following a thorough investigation into the error sources of the AO system, we predict the root mean square (RMS) wavefront error of the system and its corresponding Strehl ratio over nine analysis cases over the worst (2σ) seeing conditions. From the analysis, we expect Strehl ratio >0.3 in most seeing conditions with guide stars."
"Raman Lidar for the Measurement of Temperature, Water Vapor, and Aerosol in Beijing in the Winter of 2014",2018,"['Lidar', 'Rotational Raman', 'Temperature', 'Water vapor', 'Aerosol']",,"To measure atmospheric temperature, water vapor, and aerosol simultaneously, an efficient multi-function Raman lidar using an ultraviolet-wavelength laser has been developed. A high-performance spectroscopic box that utilizes multicavity interference filters, mounted sequentially at small angles of incidence, is used to separate the lidar return signals at different wavelengths, and to extract the signals with high efficiency. The external experiments are carried out for simultaneous detection of atmospheric temperature, water vapor, and aerosol extinction coefficient in Beijing, under clear and hazy weather conditions. The vertical profiles of temperature, water vapor, and aerosol extinction coefficient are analyzed. The results show that for an integration time of 5 min and laser energy of 200 mJ, the mean deviation between measurements obtained by lidar and radiosonde is small, and the overall trend is similar. The statistical temperature error for nighttime is below 1 K up to a height of 6.2 km under clear weather conditions, and up to a height of 2.5 km under slightly hazy weather conditions, with 5 min of observation time. An effective range for simultaneous detection of temperature and water vapor of up to 10 km is achieved. The temperature-inversion layer is found in the low troposphere. Continuous observations verify the reliability of Raman lidar to achieve real-time measurement of atmospheric parameters in the troposphere."

The data collected were processed using the SPSS 18.0K for descriptive statistics, T-test, ANOVA and regression analysis.Findings: The results of this study can be summed up as follows. The empowerment of the subjects scored 3.73 on average on the 5-point scale. To be specific, the sub-factor 'meaning' scored the highest or 4.01, while the sub-factor 'impact' was lowest. Subjects' job satisfaction scored 3.37 and their organizational commitment scored 3.54 both on the 5-point scales.Practical Implications: Meaning and self determination of empowerment positively related to subjects' job satisfaction and organizational commitment, and particularly, meaning of empowerment was more strongly related. Hence, it is required of the general hospitals to operate a customized competence build-up program and educational courses on a continual basis. Besides, it would also be important to create a working environment wherein the administrative staff can demonstrate their deliberation, autonomy and independent services."

But Europe is not the most welcoming place for North Koreans at the moment. The European Alliance for Human Rights in North Korea, an advocacy group, reported in 2015 that many European countries had rejected the vast majority of North Korean asylum cases. Partly this is to do with how governments view North Korean defectors: the UK “considers North Koreans as South Korean citizens, thus excluding them from refugee status”"

This study points to wide-spread consumer harm cases such as mis-selling scandals of debt-cancellation-debt-suspention products and ‘cardsurance’ sales by credit card companies where financial companies mis-sold financial products to consumers by misrepresenting the terms and conditions of such products. While we expect the uprise of similar cases of widespread consumer harm in the future, existing current law is ill-suited to amend these types of harm because they are limited to cumbersome and time–consuming means such as litigation and financial dispute resolution systems. Furthermore, (unlike certain foreign jurisdictions studied in this case study) Korean national laws lack the explicit legal grounds to mandate financial companies to reimburse consumers in cases of widespread consumer harm. Widespread mis-selling is not a phenomenon exclusive to Korea. In the United States, widespread mis-selling of credit card add-on products called the attention of the CFPB, while in the United Kingdom, mis-selling of payment protection insurance has also caused the FSA/FCA to perform drastic measures for consumer redress of these products. Notably, in these two nations consumer redress in cases of widepspread financial harm are done efficiently and effectively. Financial companies were required by their financial authorities to reimburse directly to the consumers of the financial harm caused by mis-selling (in the U.S. by way of consent order), or to notify their consumers of the possibility of financial harm caused by mis-selling (in the U.K. by way of PPI consumer redress schemes).Most importantly, in the U.S. and the U.K., consumer redress schemes are imposed and operated by explicit legal mandates, guidelines and procedures promulgated by financial authorities, and are closely supervised by financial authorities. This paper argues that the Financial Consumer Protection Bill which is submitted to the Korean legislature should include new provisions on consumer-friendly consumer redress schemes which are modeled after these foreign examples."

Mesozoic magmatism in the eastern North China Craton: Insights on tectonic cycles associated with progressive craton destruction,2018,"['Petrology', 'Geochemistry', 'Zircon U-Pb geochronology and Lu-Hf isotopes', 'Mesozoic magmatism', 'North China Craton']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>The North China Craton (NCC) provides a classic example for lithospheric thinning associated with craton destruction (or decratonization) through multiple tectonic events. The peak of craton destruction is considered to have occurred during Mesozoic, especially in Early Cretaceous, linked to the subduction/collision between the NCC and Yangtze Craton during the Triassic in the south and the Paleo-Pacific plate subduction during Early Cretaceous in the east. Here we investigate a suite of intrusive and volcanic suites including granite, gabbro, diorite, basalt, andesite, volcanic tuff, agglomerate, siliceous tuff and trachyte from the southern Yishui and Juxian domains to gain insights into the Mesozoic tectonic evolution of the eastern NCC in relation to decratonization. Zircon U-Pb data from basalt show multiple populations with xenocrystic grains ranging in age from Paleoproterozoic (2457–1940 Ma), through Neoproterozoic (896–559 Ma), to Paleozoic (442–380 Ma) and Mesozoic (204–122 Ma). Inherited grains from the granite and gabbro yield weight mean <SUP>206</SUP>Pb/<SUP>238</SUP>U ages of 650.0 ± 13 to 773.4 ± 2.6 Ma suggesting the involvement of components from the Yangtze Craton. Magmatic zircons from diorite show weight mean <SUP>206</SUP>Pb/<SUP>238</SUP>U ages of 121.5 ± 1.2 Ma representing the emplacement age of this rock. Magmatic zircon grains from the volcanic suite (andesite, volcanic tuff, agglomerate, siliceous tuff and trachyte), show weighted mean <SUP>206</SUP>Pb/<SUP>238</SUP>U ages of 132.4 ± 1.4 Ma, 123.02 ± 0.71 Ma, 122.97 ± 0.69 Ma, 121.96 ± 0.49 Ma, and 124.6 ± 1.1 Ma respectively, corresponding to the timings of their eruption. The Paleoproterozoic zircon grains correspond to xenocrysts captured from the NCC basement rocks, whereas the Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic grains were inherited from the Yangtze Craton. The Late Triassic to Jurassic zircon grains can be correlated to delamination of the thickened continental crust during deep subduction of Yangtze continental crust and the continent-continent collision between NCC and the Yangtze Craton. The Early Cretaceous population can be linked to the subduction of the Paleo-Pacific plate from the east and related extensional setting. The geochemical data display significant enrichment in LREE along with negative Eu anomalies, with high Th/Ta and La/Nb ratios, negative Nb–Ta anomalies, and high concentration of LILE (K, Rb, Ba and Pb) than HFSE (Nb, Ta and Ti), suggesting subduction-related arc magmatic setting in an active continental margin. Zircon Lu-Hf data from these rocks display dominantly negative εHf(t) values ranging from −36.8 to −3.1, T<SUB>DM</SUB> in the range of 1105–2572 Ma, and T<SUB>DM</SUB> <SUP>C</SUP> between 1785 Ma and 3776 Ma, indicating that the magma sources involved Paleoproterozoic components with minor input of reworked Archean crust through different degrees of enrichment with crustal material and minor input from extension-related mantle melting. In conjunction with the results from previous studies in the eastern NCC, we propose that the late Paleozoic southward subduction of the Paleo-Asian Ocean, the Triassic northward subduction and collision of the Yangtze Craton with the NCC, and the Early Cretaceous westward subduction of the Paleo-Pacific plate jointly contributed to the cratonic destruction of NCC. The Paleo-Pacific plate subduction beneath the NCC (major contributing mechanism) with the slab rollback induced lithospheric extension likely facilitated back-arc spreading, asthenospheric upwelling resulting in lithospheric thinning including delamination, melting of lithosphere mantle, and underplating of the modified mantle beneath the lower crust of the NCC during the Early Cretaceous.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  Early Cretaceous magmatic suite from the eastern NCC"
多音字에 걸친 陽聲韻의 互用에 관한 考察,2018,"['Multi-sound characters', 'Old Chinese', 'Nasal finals', 'Confusing', 'Syllable system', '音字', '陽聲韻', '上古音', '互用', '音節構造']",,"This study explored changes in the syllable structure in Old Chinese by analyzing instances of the alternation of Nasal finals with other finals through multi-sound characters in Ancient Chinese. The following conclusions were drawn.  (1) Word-final Nasals in Language A of Early Old Chinese changed to Vowel u · i · ∅ in Language B of Middle Old Chinese.  (2) Early Old Chinese had closed syllables, for example, CɑC and C1C2ɑC1C2. The syllable C1C2ɑC1C2 in Early Old Chinese changed to an open syllable, such as C1ɑ∅ · u · i or C2ɑ∅ · u · i in Middle Old Chinese. Therefore, the initial a double consonant can be reconstructed easily, but athe final double consonant waiss difficult to reconstruct.  (3) In Language AB in Middle Old Chinese, which was formed through a contact between Language A and Language B, there existed many sub-language groups such as AB1(C)→AB2(Q・N)→AB3(t · k · n · ŋ)→AB4(p · t · k · m · n · ŋ), according to the word-final consonant. This is also observed in changes in word-final consonants form Ancient Chinese to Modern Chinese as well as in Chinese dialects.  (4) Early Old Chinese had closed syllables wherein many consonants continued, such as CɑC or C1C2ɑC1C2 or C1C2C3ɑC1C2C3. These syllable structures suggest that meant Early Old Chinese was influenced by asome language that was dissimilar tohad totally different syllable structures from Chinese .  (5) It is necessary to further study many Altaic languages around China and Old Korean in order to clarify the double consonant syllable system in Early Old Chinese."

However, since cross-border working of a patented invention is increasing due to the globalization and internationl networking, it is difficult to determine the country where the patented invention is being worked (whether it is the location of the server, the location of the terminal receiving the service, or the location of the service provider).First of all, the interpretation that patent infringement does not exist unless all elements of a patented invention (a product or a process) are physically present in the country is not inevitably derived from the principle of territoriality. In addition, according to the case law of the U.S., the U.K. and Germany, even where the patented system or method is partly worked abroad, it may still constitute patent infringement. Furthermore, it is necessary to cope with the cross-border patent infringement situation that is frequent in the digital and network technology environment. Thus, the possibility and necessity of flexible interpretation of territoriality can be recognized.Next, in relation to the flexible interpretation of territoriality, it would be a solution to determine the place of patent infringement based on where the ‘main act’ has been performed. The ‘main act’ test has an affinity with the patent law system and the specific requirements of the test can be established by accumulation of cases. When determining where the ‘main act’ has been performed, it is necessary to comprehensively consider factors such as (i) the physical location of the decision maker of the working and (ii) the place where the technical effect of a patented invention is realized. This test, which is similar to the ‘control and beneficial use’ criteria set out in the US case law, should be applied equally regardless of the category of the invention, whether it is a system claim or a method claim.By the way, in case of network related inventions, profit is usually generated through ‘use’ of the system rather than through manufacture and sale of the system. In addition, many network related inventions are claimed as processes. Therefore, the working act of ‘use’ is more important than before when determining patent infringement. In these situations, it is necessary to interpret the meaning of ‘use’ of the product or process, not formally but normatively. Furthermore, if it is not sufficient to cope with cross-border patent infringement with these interpretations, it will be necessary to amend the provisions of infringing act to incorporate the specially adapted infringing act in relation to network-related inventions.Finally, in case of cross-border working of a patented invention carried out by a plurality of actors, both the issue of divided infringement and the issue of territoriality matter. In this situation, it should first be determined whether the infringing act has been committed in this country or not and, if so, it should then be determined who among the plurality of actors is responsible for the infringing act."
A Novel MEMS Microheater Based Alcohol Gas Sensor using Nanoparticles,2018,"['Thin film MEMS', 'titanium dioxide', 'polysilicon', 'micro-heater']",,"This work reports the simulation of nanoparticle coated MEMS based Alcohol Gas Sensor analysis with various parameters like power consumption, temperature uniformity, resistance change, sensitivity and selectivity. It is achieved by measuring the change in resistance when gas is exposed over the sensing layer. This instantaneous response in detection of gases helps in various application such as breath analyzer in vehicles, breath analyzer, food quality control etc. The gas sensor employs a mesh type poly silicon micro-hotplate structure. The sensor holds a very thin conducting film made of titanium which detects the presence of ethyl alcohol vapors on it. The temperature generated by the hot-plate influences various factors such as the conductance of the film and the quantity of a particular gas adsorbed on it. When sensor film is bring to the right boiling point temperature it evaporates residual vapor particles. For effective sensing of alcohol gas, we optimize the supply voltage (around 3 Volts) and the uniform temperature profile of the micro heater was analyzed (619.29 K) along with sensitivity and selectivity. For the gas sensing analysis, we have compared the sensitivity of thin film coating of ZnO, TiO₂, and SnO. The design was simulated by means of joules heating, thermal expansion and Electric current FEM simulation."

The microbolometer sensor features 80x60 pixels low-resolution format and enables the use of wafer-level vacuum packaging (WLVP) technology. Read-out IC (ROIC) implements infrared signal detection and offset correction for fixed pattern noise (FPN) using an internal digital to analog convertor (DAC) value control function. A reliable WLVP thermal sensor was obtained with the design of lid wafer, the formation of Au80%wtSn20% eutectic solder, outgassing control and wafer to wafer bonding condition. The measurement of thermal conductance enables us to inspect the internal atmosphere condition of WLVP microbolometer sensor. The difference between the measurement value and design one is 3.6×10-9 [W/K] which indicates that thermal loss is mainly on account of floating legs. The mean time to failure (MTTF) of a WLVP thermal sensor is estimated to be about 10.2 years with a confidence level of 95 %. Reliability tests such as high temperature/low temperature, bump, vibration, etc. were also conducted. Devices were found to work properly after accelerated stress tests. A thermal camera with visible camera was developed. The thermal camera is available for non-contact temperature measurement providing an image that merged the thermal image and the visible image."
Hierarchical topic modeling with pose-transition feature for action recognition using 3D skeleton data,2018,"['3D action recognition', 'Topic modeling', 'Pose-transition feature', 'Pachinko allocation model', 'Depth camera']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Despite impressive achievements in image processing and artificial intelligence in the past decade, understanding video-based action remains a challenge. However, the intensive development of 3D computer vision in recent years has brought more potential research opportunities in pose-based action detection and recognition. Thanks to the advantages of depth camera devices like the Microsoft Kinect sensor, we developed an effective approach to in-depth analysis of indoor actions using skeleton information, in which skeleton-based feature extraction and topic model-based learning are two major contributions. Geometric features, i.e. joint distance, joint angle, and joint-plane distance are calculated in the spatio-temporal dimension. These features are merged into two types, called pose and transition features, and then are provided to codebook construction to convert sparse features into visual words by <I>k</I>-means clustering. An efficient hierarchical model is developed to describe the full correlation of feature - poselet - action based on Pachinko Allocation Model. This model has the potential to uncover more hidden poselets, which have been recognized as the valuable information and help to differentiate pose-sharing actions. The experimental results on several well-known datasets, such as MSR Action 3D, MSR Daily Activity 3D, Florence 3D Action, UTKinect-Action 3D, and NTU RGB+D Action Recognition, demonstrate the high recognition accuracy of the proposed method.

The guilt and shame of the survivors was the driving force of the literary representation and testimony which continued from the short story 「Spring Day」 to the long story 『Spring day』. Therefore, after the 『Spring day』, Lim Chul-woo should have been able to escape from the historical crush. However, repetitive writing could not express the impatience of shame and shame left by the subject. 『One hundred years inn』 was requested when the reappearance could not be reached. 『One hundred years inn』 is not the writing of the representation and testimony but the ethical writing which keeps on looking back the subject continuously is the place of literature after the incident.For this purpose, this study focused on the relationship between ‘K’ and ‘you’ in the works. ‘K’ (Park Hyo-sun) calls three times to ‘You’, the speaker of the work on May 18. It was a summons of alive Kay. However, when you ignore ‘K’, the embarrassment and embarrassment of the self is born. The attempt to express this was the driving force of repetitive writing. However, the conversation with ‘Seonok’ makes us realize that self - compassion - centered self - writing does not allow us to look into the pain and sorrow of our neighbor. When I reached an ethical point of view that I was insensitive to the suffering of a neighboring neighbor through the continuous action of ‘I - look back’, a 『One hundred years inn』could be used. And this ‘me - look back’ act together with 5·18 provide the grounds to summon those who can not speak like the 4·3 Jeju events, the Korean War, and the wars of the Vietnam War to the island of Youngdo.Based on this analysis, this essay analyzed the existence of ‘K’ on three layers, interpreted it as a representation of each other by Lim Chul - woo and tried to reveal that each method of writing is different. The first ‘K’ represents the self, called Lim Chul-woo, who feels guilty and shame as being out of the eavesdropping. The writing of self-confessions corresponds to this. The second ‘K’ represents the self, called Lim Chul-woo, who attempts to reproduce Gwangju through literature as a testament to the truth of May Gwangju. Reproduction and writing of testimony correspond to this. The last ‘K’ is a voice calling ‘You’ from ‘Youngdo’ after death. It makes you listen to the suffering and groaning of the other person. It was the most powerful way to constantly summon the event to reality, as it was beyond the realistic language and the reappearance could not reach it, as if it were ‘apples-to-be’ writing, which conveys the stories of the ghosts like ‘applause shaman.’ In this study, I would like to present the conclusion that it is the writing method of Lim Chul - woo, who continuously makes the meaning of May - Gwangju as the ‘writing of the other-being’."
Comparison of removal torques between laser-etched and modified sandblasted acid-etched Ti implant surfaces in rabbit tibias,2018,"['Sandblasted large-grit acid-etched', 'Laser treatment', 'Removal torque', 'Scanning electron microscope', 'Energy dispersive spectroscopy']",,"PURPOSE. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of two different implant surface treatments on initial bone connection by comparing the Removal Torque Values (RTQs) at 7 and 10 days after chemically modified, sandblasted, large-grit and acid-etched (modSLA), and Laser-etched (LE) Ti implant placements. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Twenty modSLA and 20 LE implants were installed on the left and right tibias of 20 adult rabbits. RTQs were measured after 7 and 10 days in 10 rabbits each. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) photographs of the two implants were observed by using Quanta FEG 650 from the FEI company (Hillsboro, OR, USA). Analyses of surface elements and components were conducted using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, Horiba, Kyoto, Japan). RESULTS. The mean RTQs were $12.29{\pm}0.830$ and $12.19{\pm}0.713$ Ncm after 7 days (P=.928) and $16.47{\pm}1.324$ and $16.17{\pm}1.165$ Ncm after 10 days (P=.867) for LE and modSLA, respectively, indicating no significant inter-group differences. Pore sizes in the LE were $40{\mu}m$ and consisted of numerous small pores, whereas pore sizes in the modSLA were $5{\mu}m$. In the EDS analysis, Ti, O, and C were the only three elements found in the LE surfaces. Na, Ca, Cl, and K were also observed in modSLA, in addition to Ti, O, and C. CONCLUSION. The implants showed no significant difference in biomechanical bond strength to bone in early-stage osseointegration. LE implant can be considered an excellent surface treatment method in addition to the modSLA implant and can be applied to the early loading of the prosthesis clinically."

Furthermore, in 1997, the Korean government made the day of May 18th an official national holiday. In 2002, an enactment of a new Act honored people who related to 5.18 Uprising persons of national merit. Also, 5.18’s regional limitations pointed out that the unleash of a pro-democracy movement after 1979’s 10.26. As such, 5.18 can’t be evaluated with Gwangju region’s limited subject The reason why 5.18 Uprising couldn’t spread to the whole country was because of the military influence as a result of the 12.12 military coup. Their ‘K-Operation plan’ for the seizure of power that right before the emergency martial law, preventive custody was imposed upon active students of demonstration and major politicians.They placed army to universities, and blocked Gwangju not only areal but also journal, communication and phone line.This paper urges the Constitution to reflect the 5.18 spirit in the preamble to the constitution with meaning of ‘sovereignty revolution’ which our history never experienced with the name of modern civil revolution. 5.18 Uprising has the constitutional value of ‘democracy’ and ‘resistance’ in that it was right action to maintain and recover the constitutional order with protecting civil freedom and rights against violent dictatorship of government power."

This study points to wide-spread consumer harm cases such as mis-selling scandals of debt-cancellation-debt-suspention products and ‘cardsurance’ sales by credit card companies where financial companies mis-sold financial products to consumers by misrepresenting the terms and conditions of such products. While we expect the uprise of similar cases of widespread consumer harm in the future, existing current law is ill-suited to amend these types of harm because they are limited to cumbersome and time –consuming means such as litigation and financial dispute resolution systems. Furthermore, (unlike certain foreign jurisdictions studied in this case study) Korean national laws lack the explicit legal grounds to mandate financial companies to reimburse consumers in cases of widespread consumer harm. Widespread mis-selling is not a phenomenon exclusive to Korea. In the United States, widespread mis-selling of credit card add-on products called the attention of the CFPB, while in the United Kingdom, mis-selling of payment protection insurance has also caused the FSA/FCA to perform drastic measures for consumer redress of these products. Notably, in these two nations consumer redress in cases of widepspread financial harm are done efficiently and effectively. Financial companies were required by their financial authorities to reimburse directly to the consumers of the financial harm caused by mis-selling (in the U.S. by way of consent order), or to notify their consumers of the possibility of financial harm caused by mis-selling (in the U.K. by way of PPI consumer redress schemes).  Most importantly, in the U.S. and the U.K., consumer redress schemes are imposed and operated by explicit legal mandates, guidelines and procedures promulgated by financial authorities, and are closely supervised by financial authorities. This paper argues that the Financial Consumer Protection Bill which is submitted to the Korean legislature should include new provisions on consumer-friendly consumer redress schemes which are modeled after these foreign examples."

The objectives were to assess growth and yield response of twenty newly released cowpea genotypes to different planting dates (July, August and September). Plant height, number of leaves/plant, number of branches/plant, shoot biomass, total dry matter, number of nodules/plant, weight of pod, number of seeds/pod, seed weight/pod and grain yield varied amongst the genotypes and across the different planting dates in both years. The association between grain yield and other variables analysed across both years was significant and positive except 100-seed weight and the phenological characters of the plant. Path coefficients analysis across two years indicated that seed weight/pod followed by number of branches/plant and number of seeds/pod had positive direct effect on grain yield of cowpea in contrast to characters that exhibited negative but direct effect on yield. The other traits had relatively negligible to low indirect effects that were positive through other component traits. The grain yield sequence of interaction between genotype and date of planting was in this order: IT06K-141 planted in July ＞ IT11K-61-82 planted in September ＞ IT99K-573-1-1 planted in August. IT06K-141 genotype was considered to be better endowed genetically while the mean across both years indicated August as appropriate planting date to ensure high and sustainable grain yield."

For that reason, the administrative laws and concerned ordinances have a variety of administrative means like administrative penalties, administrative enforcement and administrative immediate enforcement and so on. Among these means, the administrative penalties refers to “he punishment imposed by the state or the local government as a sanction based on the administrative law against those who break down the administrative laws.” We cannot emphasize too much the significance of the administrative penalties in that we are able to secure the effectiveness of the administration and to set the desirable direction of the administrative order thorough the administrative penalties. Particularly, the administrative penalties are divided into the administrative punishment and administrative order punishment. And the former is a sanction against the acts to violate the laws materially and the latter is a sanction against the trivial violations against the laws, which can lead to the administrative disruptions to some extent, though it does not influence the general social interests. In particular, administrative order punishment, that is, the administrative fine for minor violation against the laws, is essential means for the sake of establishment of strict administration order. Furthermore as the administrative fine is simple to impose, it is possible to secure the immediate procedure. And we can not deny the meaning and interest of the administrative fine, in that policy to adopt and apply the administrative fine is harmonious with current trend, decriminalization.  Nevertheless, it is well known that the administrative fine is a penalty that lacks the effective enforcement and imposes a trivial violation against the law. Moreover he fact that there is no clear criterion in deciding the amount of imposed administrative fine shows that the system relating to the operation of the administrative penalty is still to be improved. Thus it is necessary for us to refer to the experience of United Kingdom because the State has operated the system of the administrative fine fairly and flexibly. Taking into the consideration of the system for the sake of administrative fine in U.K., we are able to consider the diversification of the fine imposition procedure, effective provision of related information for the payment and resilience of the amount of fines and the various operation of the appeal system etc. As mentioned, it is necessary to emphasize the fact that as the administrative penalties is the sanction which is aimed to slight violation, we can not focus on the enforcement for the administrative fine too much. Therefore we had better have the reverse idea focusing on the voluntary payment of the fine rather than enforcement."

OECD의 BEPS 프로젝트가 주목한 대상 중에는 혼성단체를 이용한 cross-border tax arbitrage가 포함되어 있고, OECD는 국내 세법상 대응 방안으로 연계 규정(linking rule)의 도입을 권고하였다. 덴마크와 영국처럼 BEPS 프로젝트 이전부터 혼성단체를 이용한 cross-border tax arbitrage에 대한 대응 입법을 마련한 나라가 있는가 하면, 멕시코와 미국은 BEPS 프로젝트 발표 이후에 연계 규정을 도입하였다.  연계 규정은 다른 나라의 세법상 법률 효과를 근거로 국내 세법을 적용하는 것이어서 이론적으로나 실무적으로나 여러 가지 어려움이 발생할 수 있으며, 이 점은 연계 규정의 입법 과정에서 간과되어서는 안 될 부분이다. 또한 우리나라는 cross-border tax arbitrage에 대한 대응 입법이나 연계 규정에 관한 경험이 많지 않아 입법이나 운용 과정에서 시행착오를 겪을 수 있다. 따라서 연계 규정의 도입 과정에서는 다른 나라의 입법례 분석이 더욱 중요하다.  우리나라가 BEPS 프로젝트 논의를 토대로 연계 규정을 도입한다면, 우선 덴마크, 영국, 멕시코, 미국의 입법례와 운용 사례를 면밀히 검토하여야 한다. 또한 다른 OECD 회원국의 입법 동향을 주의 깊게 살펴보면서 앞서 검토한 입법례 이외의 다른 형태로 입법을 할 수 있는지도 연구할 필요가 있다. 우리나라의 도입 초기에는 멕시코 및 미국의 입법례를 참고삼아 제한적 범위에서 연계 규정을 시행한 후, 운용 결과를 토대로 미비점을 보완할 수 있다. 멕시코와 미국의 입법례를 도입 초기의 모범으로 삼은 까닭은, BEPS 프로젝트의 논의를 반영한 가장 최근의 입법례일 뿐 아니라 우리나라의 현실과도 맞기 때문이다. 물론 연계 규정의 도입에 앞서, 혼성단체를 이용한 cross-border tax arbitrage 에 관한 우리나라의 실태를 정확히 파악하는 작업도 결코 소홀히 할 수 없다.","Hybrid entities can cause double taxation, but at the same time they can also be used as tools for tax arbitrage. “Tax arbitrage"" refers to transactions that make use of different or conflicting tax laws between two countries in order to result in double non-taxation. Tax arbitrage using hybrid entities can be distinguished into “Deduction/No Inclusion (D/NI)"" types and “Deduction/Deduction (D/D)"" types.  Recently, the OECD has advised OECD member states and G20 countries to counter these cases of tax arbitrage by taking legislative action. The legislative means recommended by the OECD is the so-called linking rule. The linking rule is a tax provision that links one country’s tax treatment to the tax treatment in the other country. In essence, the OECD’s linking rule suggests that in cases of the aforementioned D/NI type and D/D type tax arbitrage, domestic reverse hybrid entities should be prohibited from making deductions. The OECD further has recommended that use of the linking rule should be limited to transactions among related parties or to structured arrangements.   A look at legislative trends in other countries reveals that some countries have already adopted the linking rule prior to the OECD’s recommendation. For instance, Denmark has enacted legislation to respond to use of hybrid entities for tax arbitrage in transactions among related parties. The U.K. also has adopted provisions prohibiting U.K. corporate entities from making deductions in order to prevent tax arbitrage through hybrid entities. After the OECD’s BEPS Project, Mexico and the United States have newly enacted provisions in its tax laws that are similar to the linking rule proposed by the OECD.   Should Korea intend to prevent tax arbitrage through hybrid entities by prohibiting deduction by domestic reverse hybrid entities, it will be necessary to enact a linking rule provision which sets out the specific requirements and legal effects. First, legislation against such tax arbitrage should indeed include the other country’s tax treatment as a criterion. Second, the problem in tax arbitrages through hybrid entities lies in the double deduction of costs, which makes denial of costs deductions by domestic reverse hybrid entities an appropriate measure. Lastly, while the scope of the new legislated provision should be limited to related parties, if structured arrangements are to be included in such scope, a clear definition of the scope of structured arrangements must be given so as to grant taxpayers sufficient predictability."

The Japanese were fascinated by the way an ancient dinosaur contaminated with radioactivity trampled over the city of Tokyo. Since then, most of the monsters in the Godzilla series have destroyed the city. Their attachment to the monsters destroying cities was related to the unconsciousness of Japanese society about rapid urbanization.  Various social issues such as the loss of traditional culture, the collapse of traditional communities, the decline in rural population, the regional inequality and the gap between the rich and the poor had emerged through the era of rapid economic growth from 1955 to 1973. Therefore, the cities had become important backgrounds of stories in art, literature, and movies. It was also a subject of reflection and consideration, and sometimes a field of visual experimentation.  In the series of Eki-Mae(means ‘in front of train station’) produced in Toho Studio from 1958 to 1969, ‘Eki-Mae’, the symbolic space in the era of rapid economic growth was the important background of the stories. The themes of the stories were conflicts of old and new, the nostalgia of the past, and adjustment to new social surroundings. Film directors who were interested in social issues often covered the subject of urbanization and the changes in lifestyle. In She and He directed by Hani Susumu, he dealt with urbanization from different perspectives on the backdrop of the same place as Kigeki Eki-Mae Danchi(Comedy – The Housing Estate in Front of the Train Station) the second film in Eki-Mae series. He raised the question of loss of humanity in the film.  By the 1960s, urbanization became even faster. In particular, during the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and the 1970 Osaka World Expo, Japan was developed and reorganized around major cities such as Tokyo and Osaka. Due to the lack of urban workers, young local workers moved to the big cities through ‘the mass employment.’ They were called ‘the golden eggs’ and had become one of the driving force of advanced economic growth with cheap labor. Nagayama Norio who killed four people with a gun in four cities – Tokyo, Kyoto, Hakodate, and Nagoya – in October and November of 1968, also moved to Tokyo by the mass employment as a generation of the golden eggs and then changed his employment from city to city.  The landscape film A.K.A Serial Killer, about Nagayama Norio, contained urban landscapes all over Japan in the late 1960s. Adachi Masao and Matsuda Masao discovered uniformized landscapes originating from Tokyo.

종합 평점과 다기준 평점을 선택적으로 활용하는 협업필터링 기반 하이브리드 추천 시스템,2018,"['추천시스템', '하이브리드 추천시스템', '다기준 평점', '협업필터링', '선택적 활용', 'Recommender system', 'Hybrid recommender system', 'Multicriteria ratings', 'Collective filtering', 'Selective use']",,"Recommender system recommends the items expected to be purchased by a customer in the future according to his or her previous purchase behaviors. It has been served as a tool for realizing one-to-one personalization for an e-commerce service company. Traditional recommender systems, especially the recommender systems based on collaborative filtering (CF), which is the most popular recommendation algorithm in both academy and industry, are designed to generate the items list for recommendation by using ‘overall rating’ – a single criterion. However, it has critical limitations in understanding the customers’ preferences in detail. Recently, to mitigate these limitations, some leading e-commerce companies have begun to get feedback from their customers in a form of ‘multicritera ratings’. Multicriteria ratings enable the companies to understand their customers’ preferences from the multidimensional viewpoints. Moreover, it is easy to handle and analyze the multidimensional ratings because they are quantitative. But, the recommendation using multicritera ratings also has limitation that it may omit detail information on a user’s preference because it only considers three-to-five predetermined criteria in most cases.  Under this background, this study proposes a novel hybrid recommendation system, which selectively uses the results from ‘traditional CF’ and ‘CF using multicriteria ratings’. Our proposed system is based on the premise that some people have holistic preference scheme, whereas others have composite preference scheme. Thus, our system is designed to use traditional CF using overall rating for the users with holistic preference, and to use CF using multicriteria ratings for the users with composite preference.  To validate the usefulness of the proposed system, we applied it to a real-world dataset regarding the recommendation for POI (point-of-interests). Providing personalized POI recommendation is getting more attentions as the popularity of the location-based services such as Yelp and Foursquare increases. The dataset was collected from university students via a Web-based online survey system. Using the survey system, we collected the overall ratings as well as the ratings for each criterion for 48 POIs that are located near K university in Seoul, South Korea. The criteria include ‘food or taste’, ‘price’ and ‘service or mood’. As a result, we obtain 2,878 valid ratings from 112 users. Among 48 items, 38 items (80%) are used as training dataset, and the remaining 10 items (20%) are used as validation dataset. To examine the effectiveness of the proposed system (i.e. hybrid selective model), we compared its performance to the performances of two comparison models – the traditional CF and the CF with multicriteria ratings. The performances of recommender systems were evaluated by using two metrics - average MAE(mean absolute error) and precision-in-top-N. Precision-in-top-N represents the percentage of truly high overall ratings among those that the model predicted would be the N most relevant items for each user. The experimental system was developed using Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).  The experimental results showed that our proposed system (avg. MAE = 0.584) outperformed traditional CF (avg. MAE = 0.591) as well as multicriteria CF (avg. AVE = 0.608). We also found that multicriteria CF showed worse performance compared to traditional CF in our data set, which is contradictory to the results in the most previous studies. This result supports the premise of our study that people have two different types of preference schemes – holistic and composite. Besides MAE, the proposed system outperformed all the comparison models in precision-in-top-3, precision-in-top-5, and precision-in-top-7. The results from the paired samples t-test presented that our proposed system outperformed traditional CF with 10% statistical significance level, and multicriteria CF with 1% statistical significance l"

Sie erfolgt also nicht, wenn es um andere Freiheitsentziehungen als Strafe, die im Ausland verhängt und vollstreckt worden sind, geht. So könne eine erlittene Untersuchungshaft im Ausland nur bei der Zumessung der Strafe berücksichtigt werden. Es steht also im pflichtgemäßen Ermessen des Richters, ob und in welchem Umfang er die Untersuchungshaft im Ausland bei der Zumessung der Strafe berücksichtigen will.Gegner der herrschenden Meinung sind dagegen bemüht zu behaupten, dass die Vorschrift des §7 StGB für eine erlittene Untersuchungshaft im Ausland entsprechend gelten sollte, nach der die vollstreckte Strafe im Ausland auf die neue Strafe angerechnet wird. So solle sie bei Fällung des Urteils auf die erkannte Strafe ganz und teilweise angerechnet werden. Gegner gehen davon aus, dass derjenige, der verurteilt wird, durch Anrechnung des Übels auf die Strafe entschädigt wird.Der Verfasser ist der Meinung, dass die erlittene Untersuc hungshaft im Ausland nicht der vollstreckten Strafe im Ausland gleichstellt, da das eine Fiktion ist, die systemwidrig und gegenüber den Funktionen, welche die Strafe haben soll, bedenklich erscheint. Aus der Tatsache, dass die Untersuchungshaft im Ausland regelmäßig auch dann anzurechnen ist, wenn sie sich auf eine ganze andere Tat bezog als auf die, die zur Verurteilung führte, läßt sich ferner ablesen, dass hinter der Anrechnung ein anderer Gedanke stecken muß als der einer nachträglich vorweggenommen Strafe."

The research was carried out from March to June, 2018 and the participants were 32 students who listened to Creativity Education for Young Children at K university in Y city. The students participated in early childhood creative education classes, including contemporary art appreciation and expression activities, once a week for 10 weeks. Participants of the study filled an open questionnaire about creativity education, made a reflective journal about the contemporary art appreciation and expression activity, and wrote a reflection paper at the end of term. The researcher observed and documented the activities of the curriculum and conducted a focus group interview. As a result, it was found that the pre-service early childhood teachers experienced a) joyful imagination, b) intrinsic motivation and immersion, c) communication and cooperation, d) discovering their own creativity, e) a change of perception about creativity, and f) greater confidence in creativity education. These results show that it is of educational value to utilize contemporary art appreciation activities for creativity education for pre-service early childhood education teachers. Furthermore, it suggests that the learner’s direct involvement in the education of creativity for pre-service teachers, the utilization of art activities, imagination, immersion, cooperation experience and opportunities for reflective thinking should be provided."

To meet this goal, I examined the significance and status of ‘Clear Comprehension of Movement’ in Early Buddhism and revealed the relationship between the ‘Clear Comprehension of Movement’ and Mindfulness (Sati) by investigating the use of Sampajañña, the inner mechanism of ‘Clear Comprehension of Movement’, in the Early Buddhist texts. ‘Clear Comprehension of Movement’ is a practice to be aware of the act and behavior of everyday life. In the early scriptures, ‘Clear Comprehension of Movement’ is a particularly emphasized practice in 21 subjects of the Cattāro Satipaṭṭhanā. It is a powerful daily practice in which the monk’s whole life becomes an object of performance, keeping a clear perception and developing wisdom. In the early scriptures, Sampajañña was almost used along with Sati for complementary action of functions that capture the object and know the object clearly, which leads to developing wisdom. However, when Sampajañña was used alone, he knew that he only knew some facts but lacked elements of wisdom. I examined the possibility of practicing meditation in everyday life with contemporary meaning of ‘Clear Comprehension of Movement’ and applied ‘Clear Comprehension of Movement’ in the daily life such as washing dishes. The significance of this study is that the application of ‘Clear Comprehension of Movement’ to modern daily practice was proved to be possible and that the use of Sampajañña in early Buddhist texts was examined carefully."

As a result, the book confirmed that King Jeongjo(正祖) had compiled it as part of a policy of encouraging and nurturing Sungkyunkwan(成均館) students' academic knowledge. King Jeongjo(正祖) can not immediately help students with the test, but he tried to get the effect of improving student achievement by giving tae-kwa(大科) kŭp-che(及第) to chang-wŏn(壯元). In addition he expected the effect of expanding participation and interest in the nominal Sungkyunkwan(成均館) test.

As a text, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels' declaration on the Communist Alliance and the reform program of the peasant Donghak were choose.This Declaration and the Reformation are the works of philosophical practice discourse of the 1800s in this article, which unfolds paradigmatically, deriving its common symbolic meaning in the semiotic sense, and evolving ideologically towards a democracy free of property.In the end, these two historical incident which are published in the contemporary breath, constitute an accusation against a nonhuman policy of surveillance and punishment. Twice a day, the space of the church is transformed into a factory, the act of dividing into two categories by capitalist and work and divorcing by accident is embodied as a social ethic. It is against the phenomenon that the structure of which no man exists is no longer institutionalized.The revolutionary movement aimed at breaking the framework of this hunt manifests itself in the two manifestos mentioned above, and Karl Marx completes the culmination of the utopia that must be achieved through the Declaration of the Communist Alliance by placing his being in the position of ""eternal refugee"". By choosing to die in his freedom developed during Jeon Bong-joon's trial, he also completes the people's spirit of revolution.In the case of simultaneous exploitation in East and West, the form of oppression is the withdrawal of capital from domination and power, and a new alternative to this is the philosophical context that allows the establishment of a new paradigm with ""man is the greatest capital""."

We propose new quantile-based tests for exponentiality against decreasing mean residual quantile function (DMRQ) and new better than used in expectation (NBUE) classes of alternatives. The exact null distribution of the test statistic is derived when the alternative class is DMRQ. The asymptotic properties of both the test statistics are studied. The performance of the proposed tests with other existing tests in the literature is evaluated through simulation study. Finally, we illustrate our test procedure using real data sets."
