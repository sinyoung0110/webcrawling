k-NN Join Based on LSH in Big Data Environment,2018,"['Big data', 'High dimension', 'k-NN join', 'LSH', 'Spark']",,"k-Nearest neighbor join (k-NN Join) is a computationally intensive algorithm that is designed to find k-nearest neighbors from a dataset S for every object in another dataset R. Most related studies on k-NN Join are based on single-computer operations. As the data dimensions and data volume increase, running the k-NN Join algorithm on a single computer cannot generate results quickly. To solve this scalability problem, we introduce the locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) k-NN Join algorithm implemented in Spark, an approach for high-dimensional big data. LSH is used to map similar data onto the same bucket, which can reduce the data search scope. In order to achieve parallel implementation of the algorithm on multiple computers, the Spark framework is used to accelerate the computation of distances between objects in a cluster. Results show that our proposed approach is fast and accurate for high-dimensional and big data."
Analysis of Market Trajectory Data using k-NN,2018,"['Data Analytics', 'Statistical Analytics', 'K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm', 'Point of Sales Data', 'Trajectory Data']",,"Recently, as the sensor and big data analysis technology have been developed, there have been a lot of researches that analyze the purchase-related data such as the trajectory information and the stay time. Such purchase-related data is usefully used for the purchase pattern prediction and the purchase time prediction. Because it is difficult to find periodic patterns in large-scale human data, it is necessary to look at actual data sets, find various feature patterns, and then apply a machine learning algorithm appropriate to the pattern and purpose. Although existing papers have been used to analyze data using various machine learning methods, there is a lack of statistical analysis such as finding feature patterns before applying the machine learning algorithm. Therefore, we analyze the purchasing data of Songjeong Maeil Market, which is a data gathering place, and finds some characteristic patterns through statistical data analysis. Based on the results of 1, we derive meaningful conclusions by applying the machine learning algorithm and present future research directions. Through the data analysis, it was confirmed that the number of visits was different according to the regional characteristics around Songjeong Maeil Market, and the distribution of time spent by consumers could be grasped."
Constraints on jet quenching in p–Pb collisions at <sub> s NN </sub> = 5.02 TeV measured by the event-activity dependence of semi-inclusive hadron-jet distributions,2018,,,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>The ALICE Collaboration reports the measurement of semi-inclusive distributions of charged-particle jets recoiling from a high-transverse momentum trigger hadron in p–Pb collisions at    <SUB>  s   NN  </SUB>   = 5.02  TeV. Jets are reconstructed from charged-particle tracks using the anti- <SUB>  k   T  </SUB>  algorithm with resolution parameter  R = 0.2  and 0.4. A data-driven statistical approach is used to correct the uncorrelated background jet yield. Recoil jet distributions are reported for jet transverse momentum  15 <   p   T , jet   ch   < 50  GeV / c  and are compared in various intervals of p–Pb event activity, based on charged-particle multiplicity and zero-degree neutral energy in the forward (Pb-going) direction. The semi-inclusive observable is self-normalized and such comparisons do not require the interpretation of p–Pb event activity in terms of collision geometry, in contrast to inclusive jet observables. These measurements provide new constraints on the magnitude of jet quenching in small systems at the LHC. In p–Pb collisions with high event activity, the average medium-induced out-of-cone energy transport for jets with  R = 0.4  and  15 <   p   T , jet   ch   < 50  GeV / c  is measured to be less than 0.4  GeV / c  at 90% confidence, which is over an order of magnitude smaller than a similar measurement for central Pb–Pb collisions at    <SUB>  s   NN  </SUB>   = 2.76  TeV . Comparison is made to theoretical calculations of jet quenching in small systems, and to inclusive jet measurements in p–Pb collisions selected by event activity at the LHC and in d–Au collisions at RHIC.</P>"

However, it is difficult to identify the wave characteristics of an epileptic EEG signals as it is very weak, non-stationary and has strong background noise. In this paper, we analyse the effect of dimensionality reduction methods on Epileptic EEG feature selection and classification. Three dimensionality reduction methods: Pincipal Component Analysis（PCA）, Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis （LDA）were investigated. The performance of each method was evaluated using Support Vector Machine （SVM）, Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearestneighbor (K-NN), Decision Tree (DR) and Random Forest (RF). From the experimental result, PCA recorded 75% highest accuracy in SVM, LR and K-NN. KPCA recorded 85% best performance in SVM and K-KNN while LDA achieved 100% accuracy in K-NN.

Noise-tolerance Investigation into Dual-kNN Pattern Classification,2018,"['k-NN', 'Dual-kNN', 'Logistic regression', 'Neural network', 'Robustness']",,"The performance of an algorithm is usually measured in three dimensions (simplicity, processing time, and prediction power). In addition, we should take into account the noise resistance level in those measures. For this reason, this paper focuses on investigating the noisetolerance level of dual k-nearest neighbors (dual-kNN) primarily based on five noisy medical diagnosis problems. Literally, dual-kNN is a reborn version of the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm with a new observation idea in the classification process with a collaborative effort between the first and second nearest neighbors of an observed instance. It was recently proven that dual-kNN has high prediction accuracy for a variety of real-world data sets, especially so in unbiased data sets. Thus, in this report, not only the prediction accuracy of dual-kNN is compared with normal k-NN, logistic regression, and the neural network, but we additionally investigate the noise tolerance in the aforementioned approaches. The practical data sets applied in this paper are medical data files from the University of California, Irvine, Machine Learning Repository. In this report, the new approach to dual-kNN commences with better prediction accuracy, and higher noise resistance is presented, in comparison with normal k-NN, logistic regression, and neural networks."
Investigation into Tolerance of Mislabeling when Classifying Patterns with Dual-kNN,2018,"['Dual-kNN', 'Density-based kNN', 'k-NN', 'Mislabeled noise']",,"As we know, machine learning algorithms are powerful tools for a variety of application domains, giving widely divergent dimensions, such as reliability, precision, robustness, high-speed solutions, etc. Likewise, the other critical dimension that a well-designed learning algorithm should occupy is strength against unpredictable and phenomenal noise. For this critical dimension, we introduce a new approach, dual k-nearest neighbors (dual-kNN), to investigate the tolerance level for mislabeling based on different injected-noise levels. Literally, dual-kNN is a reborn algorithm of k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) aiming to reduce the influence of a steady decrease in prediction accuracy over increasing k values. What is more, dual-kNN is proven to have higher classification accuracy in many application domains. For the primary goal of this paper, we mainly emphasize investigating dual-kNN’s resistance level to mislabeled classes. Provably, our empirical experimentations describe how dual-kNN has a higher resistance level to mislabeling than normal k-NN, density-based kNN, and logistic regression, for noise levels of up to 50%. The practical datasets applied within this paper are medical data files from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository."
Short-term Prediction of Localized Heavy Rain from Radar Imaging and Machine Learning,2018,"['Dual-kNN', 'kNN', 'Machine learning', 'Robustness', 'Weather forecasting']",,"Heavy rainfall has frequently caused serious flooding and landslides, increasing traffic delays in most parts of the world. Consequently, the people in areas battered by heavy rainfall face many hardships. Thus, the negative effects of torrential rainfall always remind researchers to keep seeking the ways to prevent such damage. Therefore, we designed a system for short-term prediction of localized heavy downpours by using radar images coupled with a machine learning method. Here, we introduce a new approach, named dual k-nearest neighbor (dual-kNN), for shortterm rainfall prediction by upgrading the ordinary classification routines of classical k-nearest neighbors (k-NN). dual-kNN is able to maintain highly robust classification of various K values with an advanced simple dual consideration, where observation of a targeted object can be found not only in the specified region but also in other related regions. We conducted experimentations using 2011, 2013, and 2014 data sets collected from the WITH small-dish aviation radar installed on the rooftop of Information Engineering, University of the Ryukyus. Then, we compared the prediction accuracy of our new approach with classical k-NN. It was experimentally confirmed with test cases and simulations that the performance of dual-kNN is more effective than classical k-NN."

Recognition of damage pattern and evolution in CFRP cable with a novel bonding anchorage by acoustic emission,2018,"['CFRP cable anchorage', 'acoustic emission', 'clustering-based pattern recognition', 'ultimate bearing capacity']",,"Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) cable has good mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. However, the anchorage of CFRP cable is a big issue due to the anisotropic property of CFRP material. In this article, a high-efficient bonding anchorage with novel configuration is developed for CFRP cables. The acoustic emission (AE) technique is employed to evaluate the performance of anchorage in the fatigue test and post-fatigue ultimate bearing capacity test. The obtained AE signals are analyzed by using a combination of unsupervised K-means clustering and supervised K-nearest neighbor classification (K-NN) for quantifying the performance of the anchorage and damage evolutions. An AE feature vector (including both frequency and energy characteristics of AE signal) for clustering analysis is proposed and the under-sampling approaches are employed to regress the influence of the imbalanced classes distribution in AE dataset for improving clustering quality. The results indicate that four classes exist in AE dataset, which correspond to the shear deformation of potting compound, matrix cracking, fiber-matrix debonding and fiber fracture in CFRP bars. The AE intensity released by the deformation of potting compound is very slight during the whole loading process and no obvious premature damage observed in CFRP bars aroused by anchorage effect at relative low stress level, indicating the anchorage configuration in this study is reliable."

Elliptic Flow of Charm and Strange Hadrons in High-Multiplicity p+Pb Collisions at sNN=8.16 TeV,2018,,,"<P>The elliptic azimuthal anisotropy coefficient (upsilon(2)) is measured for charm (D-0) and strange (K-S(0), Lambda, Xi(-), and Omega(-)) hadrons, using a data sample of p + Pb collisions collected by the CMS experiment, at a nucleonnucleon center-of- mass energy of root(NN)-N-s = 8.16 TeV. A significant positive upsilon(2) signal from long- range azimuthal correlations is observed for all particle species in high- multiplicity p + Pb collisions.

A New Fine-grain SMS Corpus and Its Corresponding Classifier Using Probabilistic Topic Model,2018,"['Spam SMS corpus', 'Topic Model', 'LDA', 'SMTM']",,"Nowadays, SMS spam has been overflowing in many countries. In fact, the standards of filtering SMS spam are different from country to country. However, the current technologies and researches about SMS spam filtering all focus on dividing SMS message into two classes: legitimate and illegitimate. It does not conform to the actual situation and need. Furthermore, they are facing several difficulties, such as: (1) High quality and large-scale SMS spam corpus is very scarce, fine categorized SMS spam corpus is even none at all. This seriously handicaps the researchers’ studies. (2) The limited length of SMS messages lead to lack of enough features. These factors seriously degrade the performance of the traditional classifiers (such as SVM, K-NN, and Bayes). In this paper, we present a new fine categorized SMS spam corpus which is unique and the largest one as far as we know. In addition, we propose a classifier, which is based on the probability topic model. The classifier can alleviate feature sparse problem in the task of SMS spam filtering. Moreover, we compare the approach with three typical classifiers on the new SMS spam corpus. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is more effective for the task of SMS spam filtering."

Background: Pilots can experience high cognitive workload conditions by performing various tasks simultaneously during air operation mission. Accurate detection of the cognitive workload state is required to improve the survivability of pilots and ensure flight safety.  Method: Five student pilots in 20s performed dual task consisting of simulated flight task with baseline task and three levels of N-back task (0-back, 1-back, 2-back). Three flight performance features (standard deviation of altitude, heading, airspeed) and two heart rate variability features (standard deviation of NN (SDNN), Low Frequency to High Frequency ratio (LF/HF)) were measured from the flight simulation experiment with photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor. Cognitive workload classification model was developed by pre-processing input features and output classes, applying five classifiers (Decision tree (DT), Support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Bayesian, Ensemble), and validating the model performance.  Results: High cognitive workload level (2-back) was 327%, 161%, and 1.2% higher than baseline in terms of standard deviation of altitude, standard deviation of airspeed, and LF/HF respectively. DT, SVM, KNN, Bayesian, and Ensemble classifier performance was 94.4%, 91.1%, 96.6%, 93.3%, and 96.6% with two output classes, 62%, 51.4%, 64.6%, 57.1%, and 64.6% with three output classes, 36.3%, 36%, 48%, 36.3%, and 49% with four output classes respectively.  Conclusion: The best classifier performance for detecting cognitive workload levels of pilots was acquired from an ensemble classifier with two output classes (baseline, 2-back) with an accuracy of 96.6%.  Application: The cognitive workload classification model using the ensemble classifier in this study can contribute to the development of a system capable of providing warning signal in real time under pilot""s cognitive overload situation."
A Comparative Study on Similarity Measure Techniques for Cross-Project Defect Prediction,2018,,,"Software defect prediction is helpful for allocating valuable project resources effectively for software quality assurance activities thanks to focusing on the identified fault-prone modules. If historical data collected within a company is sufficient, a Within-Project Defect Prediction (WPDP) can be utilized for accurate fault-prone module prediction. In case a company does not maintain historical data, it may be helpful to build a classifier towards predicting comprehensible fault prediction based on Cross-Project Defect Prediction (CPDP). Since CPDP employs different project data collected from other organization to build a classifier, the main obstacle to build an accurate classifier is that distributions between source and target projects are not similar. To address the problem, because it is crucial to identify effective similarity measure techniques to obtain high performance for CPDP, In this paper, we aim to identify them. We compare various similarity measure techniques. The effectiveness of similarity weights calculated by those similarity measure techniques are evaluated. The results are verified using the statistical significance test and the effect size test. The results show k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), LOcal Correlation Integral (LOCI), and Range methods are the top three performers. The experimental results show that predictive performances using the three methods are comparable to those of WPDP."

The PIL uses image data from the visualized FFT graph to detect robust points, and compares the average image similarity with a reference FFT template associated with a target of interest. The server visualizes each client's detection status including machine learning result, and trains Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with extensive regional samples from clients. Afterwards, the server tests its ANN model whenever the client reports drone detection. The accuracy rate of client's PIL test is 83% and server's ANN test accuracy rate is 86%.
