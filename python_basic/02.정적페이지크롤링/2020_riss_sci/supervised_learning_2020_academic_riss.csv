A supervised-learning-based spatial performance prediction framework for heterogeneous communication networks,2020,"['5G', 'heterogeneous communication network', 'machine learning', 'performance prediction', 'supervised learning']",,"In this paper, we propose a supervised-learning-based spatial performance prediction (SLPP) framework for next-generation heterogeneous communication networks (HCNs). Adaptive asset placement, dynamic resource allocation, and load balancing are critical network functions in an HCN to ensure seamless network management and enhance service quality. Although many existing systems use measurement data to react to network performance changes, it is highly beneficial to perform accurate performance prediction for different systems to support various network functions. Recent advancements in complex statistical algorithms and computational efficiency have made machine-learning ubiquitous for accurate data-based prediction. A robust network performance prediction framework for optimizing performance and resource utilization through a linear discriminant analysis-based prediction approach has been proposed in this paper. Comparison results with different machine-learning techniques on real-world data demonstrate that SLPP provides superior accuracy and computational efficiency for both stationary and mobile user conditions."
Supervised-learning-based algorithm for color image compression,2020,"['color image compression', 'interchannel redundancy', 'LapRLS', 'prediction model', 'supervised learning', 'total prediction error']",,"A correlation exists between luminance samples and chrominance samples of a color image. It is beneficial to exploit such interchannel redundancy for color image compression. We propose an algorithm that predicts chrominance components Cb and Cr from the luminance component Y. The prediction model is trained by supervised learning with Laplacian-regularized least squares to minimize the total prediction error. Kernel principal component analysis mapping, which reduces computational complexity, is implemented on the same point set at both the encoder and decoder to ensure that predictions are identical at both the ends without signaling extra location information. In addition, chrominance subsampling and entropy coding for model parameters are adopted to further reduce the bit rate. Finally, luminance information and model parameters are stored for image reconstruction. Experimental results show the performance superiority of the proposed algorithm over its predecessor and JPEG, and even over JPEG-XR. The compensation version with the chrominance difference of the proposed algorithm performs close to and even better than JPEG2000 in some cases."

This system has a high recognition rate of about 98% or more for the environments such as parking lots where non-vehicle is restricted; however, the environments where non-vehicle objects are not restricted, the recognition rate is about 50% to 70%. This low performance is due to the changes in the environment by non-vehicle objects in real-time situations that occur anomaly data which is similar to the license plates. In this paper, we implement the appropriate anomaly detection based on semi-supervised learning for the license plate OCR system in the real-time environment where the appearance of non-vehicle objects is not restricted.

EEMD assisted supervised learning for the fault diagnosis of BLDC motor using vibration signal,2020,['· Condition monitoring · Continuous wavelet transform · Ensemble empirical mode decomposition · Fault diagnosis · Principal component analysis'],,"Predictive maintenance (PdM) has become a major issue in system health monitoring, as machines are operating under more complex and diverse conditions nowadays.Besides minimizing the risk of a catastrophic failure, a proper maintenance scheme can amplify system yield as well as largely reduce production and maintenance costs. This paper presents a comprehensive study of a permanent magnet brushless DC (BLDC) motor’s fault diagnosis using vibration signals. Based on the degree of deviation from the normal operating condition, three health states are chosen from the entire lifecycle of motor. Acquired signals are decomposed using ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and the appropriate intrinsic mode function (IMF) is selected based on the similarity index. Later, selected IMF is analyzed in time-frequency domain by using continuous wavelet transform (CWT) for better localization of fault frequencies. Several statistical features that indicate the health state of the motor are also extracted to diagnose different fault states. Later, feature dimensions were reduced using principal component analysis (PCA) technique and classified using a supervised machine learning technique named k-nearest neighbor (KNN). Extracted IMF from EEMD provides significant fault related information to detect and diagnose different fault states. Proposed method is effectively used to diagnose fault at the incipient stage as well as classify different fault states at incipient stage and severe stage."
A Semi-supervised Learning of HMM to Build a POS Tagger for a Low Resourced Language,2020,"['HMM', 'NLP', 'Odia', 'POS tagger']",,"Part of speech (POS) tagging is an indispensable part of major NLP models. Its progress can be perceived on number of languages around the globe especially with respect to European languages. But considering Indian Languages, it has not got a major breakthrough due lack of supporting tools and resources. Particularly for Odia language it has not marked its dominancy yet. With a motive to make the language Odia fit into different NLP operations, this paper makes an attempt to develop a POS tagger for the said language on a HMM (Hidden Markov Model) platform. The tagger judiciously considers bigram HMM with dynamic Viterbi algorithm to give an output annotated text with maximum accuracy. The model is experimented on a corpus belonging to tourism domain accounting to a size of approximately 0.2 million tokens. With the proportion of training and testing as 3:1, the proposed model exhibits satisfactory result irrespective of limited training size."
"Supply Chain Analysis in Public Works: The Role of Work Climate, Supervision and Organizational Learning",2020,"['Discipline', 'Supervision', 'Work Climate', 'Organizational Learning', 'Service Performance']",,"The study aims to analyze the supply chain role of supervision, discipline, work climate, and organizational learning on the performance of community services at the public works. This study took a sample of employees through purposive sampling technique at the Public Works Office and Bina Marga in a regency in East Java. Data through questionnaire was collected through a 5-point Likert scale model. The results show that the application of employee discipline affects the performance of public services, with a contribution of 39.7%, meaning that discipline and organizational learning are implementation factors that have an effect on public service performance. In stepwise regression analysis, the supervisory factor has a correlation with service performance, but it is less relevant, while the work climate is not relevant as a predictor variable to improve public service performance. The study revealed the importance of the supply chain policy of implementing good and clean governance and the enactment of the performance appraisal of the government apparatus established through Good Corporate Governance of the state apparatus.

As a result, it is necessary to promptly inspect and repair the structure, since it can cause lost of fundamental functions and bring unexpected problems. Therefore, personnel-based inspections and repairs have been underway for maintenance of underground structures, but nowadays, objective inspection technologies have been actively developed through the fusion of deep learning and image process.

Semi-supervised based Unknown Attack Detection in EDR Environment,2020,"['Endpoint Security', 'EDR', 'Unknown Attack Detection', 'AutoEncoder', '1D CNN']",,"Cyberattacks penetrate the server and perform various malicious acts such as stealing confidential information, destroying systems, and exposing personal information. To achieve this, attackers perform various malicious actions by infecting endpoints and accessing the internal network. However, the current countermeasures are only anti-viruses that operate in a signature or pattern manner, allowing initial unknown attacks. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) technology is focused on providing visibility, and strong countermeasures are lacking. If you fail to respond to the initial attack, it is difficult to respond additionally because malicious behavior like Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack does not occur immediately, but occurs over a long period of time. In this paper, we propose a technique that detects an unknown attack using an event log without prior knowledge, although the initial response failed with anti-virus. The proposed technology uses a combination of AutoEncoder and 1D CNN (1-Dimention Convolutional Neural Network) based on semi-supervised learning. The experiment trained a dataset collected over a month in a real-world commercial endpoint environment, and tested the data collected over the next month. As a result of the experiment, 37 unknown attacks were detected in the event log collected for one month in the actual commercial endpoint environment, and 26 of them were verified as malicious through VirusTotal (VT). In the future, it is expected that the proposed model will be applied to EDR technology to form a secure endpoint environment and reduce time and labor costs to effectively detect unknown attacks."
EER-ASSL: Combining Rollback Learning and Deep Learning for Rapid Adaptive Object Detection,2020,"['Object Detection', 'Active Learning', 'Semi-Supervised Learning', 'Convolutional Neural Network']",,"We propose a rapid adaptive learning framework for streaming object detection, called EER-ASSL. The method combines the expected error reduction (EER) dependent rollback learning and the active semi-supervised learning (ASSL) for a rapid adaptive CNN detector. Most CNN object detectors are built on the assumption of static data distribution. However, images are often noisy and biased, and the data distribution is imbalanced in a real world environment. The proposed method consists of collaborative sampling and EER-ASSL. The EER-ASSL utilizes the active learning (AL) and rollback based semi-supervised learning (SSL). The AL allows us to select more informative and representative samples measuring uncertainty and diversity. The SSL divides the selected streaming image samples into the bins and each bin repeatedly transfers the discriminative knowledge of the EER and CNN models to the next bin until convergence and incorporation with the EER rollback learning algorithm is achieved. The EER models provide a rapid short-term myopic adaptation and the CNN models an incremental long-term performance improvement. EER-ASSL can overcome noisy and biased labels in varying data distribution. Extensive experiments shows that EER-ASSL obtained 70.9 mAP compared to state-of-the-art technology such as Faster RCNN, SSD300, and YOLOv2."

Resident Learning Curve for Laparoscopic Appendectomy According to Seniority,2020,"['Laparoscopic appendectomy', 'Learning curve', 'Residency', 'Education']",,"Purpose: This study sought to delineate the learning curve (LC) for laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) in surgical residency according to seniority and experience.Methods: Between October 2015 and November 2016, 150 patients underwent LA performed by one of 3 residents (who were in their first [A], second [B], or third [C] year of training) under supervision. The patients were nonrandomly assigned to each resident. Data from a prospectively collected database were reviewed and analyzed retrospectively. Perioperative outcomes including operation time, complications, and conversion were compared among the 3 residents. The LC was evaluated using the moving average method and cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) for operation time and surgical completion.Results: Baseline characteristics and perioperative outcomes were similar among the 3 groups except for age and location of the appendix. The operation time did not vary among the 3 residents (43.9, 45.3, and 48.4 minutes for A, B, and C, respectively; P=0.392). The moving average method for operation time showed a decreasing tendency for all residents. CUSUM results for operation time revealed peak points achieved at the 24th, 18th, and 31st cases for residents A, B, and C, respectively. In terms of surgical failure, residents A, B, and C reached steady states after their 35th, 11th, and 16th cases, respectively. Perforation of the appendix base was the only risk factor for surgical failure.Conclusion: The resident LC for LA was 11 to 35 cases according to multidimensional statistical analyses. The accumulation of surgical experience among residents might influence the LC for surgical completion but not that for operation time."
Automatic Determination of the Number of Clusters for Semi-Supervised Relational Fuzzy Clustering,2020,"['Semi-supervised clustering', 'Relational data', 'Fuzzy clustering', 'Local distance measure learning', 'Optimal number of clusters']",,"Semi-supervised clustering relies on both labeled and unlabeled data to steer the clustering process towards optimal categorization and escape from local minima. In this paper, we propose a novel fuzzy relational semi-supervised clustering algorithm based on an adaptive local distance measure (SSRF-CA). The proposed clustering algorithm utilizes side-information and formulates it as a set of constraints to supervise the learning task. These constraints are expressed using reward and penalty terms, which are integrated into a novel objective function. In particular, we formulate the clustering task as an optimization problem through the minimization of the proposed objective function. Solving this optimization problem provides the optimal values of different objective function parameters and yields the proposed semi-supervised clustering algorithm. Along with its ability to perform data clustering and learn the underlying dissimilarity measure between the data instances, our algorithm determines the optimal number of clusters in an unsupervised manner. Moreover, the proposed SSRF-CA is designed to handle relational data. This makes it appropriate for applications where only pairwise similarity (or dissimilarity) information between data instances is available. In this paper, we proved the ability of the proposed algorithm to learn the appropriate local distance measures and the optimal number of clusters while partitioning the data using various synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets that contain varying numbers of clusters with diverse shapes. The experimental results revealed that the proposed SSRF-CA accomplished the best performance among other state-of-the-art algorithms and confirmed the outperformance of our clustering approach."

Data Science and Machine Learning in Anesthesiology,2020,"['Artificial intelligence', 'Data science', 'Electronic health record', 'Machine learning', 'Predictive analytics', 'Risk score system.']",,"Machine learning (ML) is revolutionizing anesthesiology research. Unlike classical research methods that are largely inference-based, ML is geared more towards making accurate predictions. ML is a field of artificial intelligence concerned with developing algorithms and models to perform prediction tasks in the absence of explicit instructions. Most ML applications, despite being highly variable in the topics that they deal with, generally follow a common workflow. For classification tasks, a researcher typically tests various ML models and compares the predictive performance with the reference logistic regression model. The main advantage of ML lies in its ability to deal with many features with complex interactions and its specific focus on maximizing predictive performance. However, emphasis on data-driven prediction can sometimes neglect mechanistic understanding. This article mainly focuses on the application of supervised ML to electronic health record (EHR) data. The main limitation of EHR-based studies is in the difficulty of establishing causal relationships. However, the associated low cost and rich information content provide great potential to uncover hitherto unknown correlations. In this review, the basic concepts of ML are introduced along with important terms that any ML researcher should know. Practical tips regarding the choice of software and computing devices are also provided. Towards the end, several examples of successful ML applications in anesthesiology are discussed. The goal of this article is to provide a basic roadmap to novice ML researchers working in the field of anesthesiology."

Multimodal Biometrics Recognition from Facial Video with Missing Modalities Using Deep Learning,2020,"['Auto-encoder', 'Deep Learning', 'Multimodal Biometrics', 'Sparse Classification']",,"Biometrics identification using multiple modalities has attracted the attention of many researchers as it producesmore robust and trustworthy results than single modality biometrics. In this paper, we present a novel multimodalrecognition system that trains a deep learning network to automatically learn features after extracting multiplebiometric modalities from a single data source, i.e., facial video clips. Utilizing different modalities, i.e., leftear, left profile face, frontal face, right profile face, and right ear, present in the facial video clips, we trainsupervised denoising auto-encoders to automatically extract robust and non-redundant features. The automaticallylearned features are then used to train modality specific sparse classifiers to perform the multimodalrecognition. Moreover, the proposed technique has proven robust when some of the above modalities weremissing during the testing. The proposed system has three main components that are responsible for detection,which consists of modality specific detectors to automatically detect images of different modalities present infacial video clips; feature selection, which uses supervised denoising sparse auto-encoders network to capturediscriminative representations that are robust to the illumination and pose variations; and classification, whichconsists of a set of modality specific sparse representation classifiers for unimodal recognition, followed byscore level fusion of the recognition results of the available modalities. Experiments conducted on theconstrained facial video dataset (WVU) and the unconstrained facial video dataset (HONDA/UCSD), resultedin a 99.17% and 97.14% Rank-1 recognition rates, respectively.

Vision-Based Obstacle Avoidance for UAVs via Imitation Learning with Sequential Neural Networks,2020,"['Obstacle avoidance', 'Robot vision', 'Mobile robot navigation', 'Neural networks', 'Imitation learning', 'Machine learning']",,"This paper explores the feasibility of a framework for vision-based obstacle avoidance techniques that can be applied to unmanned aerial vehicles, where such decision-making policies are trained upon supervision of actual human flight data. The neural networks are trained based on aggregated flight data from human experts, learning the implicit policy for visual obstacle avoidance by extracting the necessary features within the image. The images and flight data are collected from a simulated environment provided by Gazebo, and Robot Operating System is used to provide the communication nodes for the framework. The framework is tested and validated in various environments with respect to four types of neural network including fully connected neural networks, two- and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Among the networks, sequential neural networks (i.e., 3D-CNNs and RNNs) provide the better performance due to its ability to explicitly consider the dynamic nature of the obstacle avoidance problem."
Prediction of Chronic Disease-Related Inpatient Prolonged Length of Stay Using Machine Learning Algorithms,2020,"['Length of Stay', 'Chronic Disease', 'Inpatients', 'Machine Learning', 'Discharge Planning']",,"Objectives: The study aimed to develop and compare predictive models based on supervised machine learning algorithms for predicting the prolonged length of stay (LOS) of hospitalized patients diagnosed with five different chronic conditions.Methods: An administrative claim dataset (2008–2012) of a regional network of nine hospitals in the Tampa Bay area, Florida, USA, was used to develop the prediction models. Features were extracted from the dataset using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Five learning algorithms, namely, decision tree C5.0, linear support vector machine (LSVM), k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and multi-layered artificial neural networks, were used to build the model with semi-supervised anomaly detection and two feature selection methods. Issues with the unbalanced nature of the dataset were resolved using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). Results:LSVM with wrapper feature selection performed moderately well for all patient cohorts. Using SMOTE to counter data imbalances triggered a tradeoff between the model’s sensitivity and specificity, which can be masked under a similar area under the curve. The proposed aggregate rank selection approach resulted in a balanced performing model compared to other criteria. Finally, factors such as comorbidity conditions, source of admission, and payer types were associated with the increased risk of a prolonged LOS. Conclusions: Prolonged LOS is mostly associated with pre-intraoperative clinical and patient socio-economic factors. Accurate patient identification with the risk of prolonged LOS using the selected model can provide hospitals a better tool for planning early discharge and resource allocation, thus reducing avoidable hospitalization costs."
Outlier Detection in Indoor Localization and Internet of Things (IoT) using Machine Learning,2020,"['Internet of things', 'localization', 'outliers', 'outliers detection.']",,"In Internet of things (IoT) millions of devices are intelligently connected for providing smart services. Especially in indoor localization environment, that is one of the most concerningtopic of smart cities, internet of things and wireless sensor networks. Many technologies are being used for localization purposein indoor environment and Wi-Fi using received signal strengths(RSSs) is one of them. Wi-Fi RSSs are sensitive to reflection, refraction, interference and channel noise that cause irregularity insignal strengths. The irregular and anomalous RSS values, used ina Wi-Fi indoor localization environment, cannot define the locationof any unknown node correctly. Therefore, this research has developed an outlier detection technique named as iF_Ensemblefor Wi-Fi indoor localization environment by analyzing RSSs using the combination of supervised, unsupervised and ensemble machine learning methods. In this research isolation forest (iForest)is used as an unsupervised learning method. Supervised learningmethod includes support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and random forest (RF) classifiers with stacking thatis an ensemble learning method. For the evaluation purpose accuracy, precision, recall, F-score and ROC-AUC curve are used. Theevaluation of used machine learning method provides high accuracy of 97.8 percent with proposed outlier detection methods andalmost 2 percent improvement in the accuracy of localization process in indoor environment after eliminating outliers."

The process of extracting feature information of an object grasp and estimating the joint angles of the robot are performed at one time from one deep neural network. There is a time-consuming and difficult pre-processing for deep learning in the robot grasping that sufficient data such as a high-quality three-dimensional object model composed of multi-modal sensor information must be secured. We use a relatively small amount of RGB images captured by the head camera and wrist camera to minimize the effort. We present a system that performs the entire grasping operation with two identical structures of deep neural networks, and generate an image focused on a target object using a semantic segmentation technique to maximize efficiency by using it as an input of the first deep neural network. We propose a method to solve various one-to-many matching situations that occur in robot grasping by modifying the Mixture Density Network(MDN) to output the amount of change from the current to the next joint angles. Each learning weight of joints is trained as a learning variable or random constants are given to the training weights of robot joints in the kernel function. Training systems show a high improvement of the success rate.

This study seeks to develop a defect inspection model using machine learning. Defect detection problems for images correspond to classification problems, which are the method of supervised learning in machine learning. In this study, defect detection models are developed based on algorithms that automatically extract features and algorithms that do not extract features. One-dimensional CNN and two-dimensional CNN are used as algorithms for automatic extraction of features, and MLP and SVM are used as algorithms for non-extracting features. A defect detection model is developed based on four models and their accuracy and AUC compare based on AUC. Although image classification is common in the development of models using CNN, high accuracy and AUC is achieved when developing SVM models by converting pixels from images into RGB values in this study."

Most dehazing studies have used datasets that consist of pairs of images, one hazy and one haze-free of the same scene, for training purposes. However, in the real world, it is almost impossible to acquire this kind of data where the hazy image and the haze-free image are perfectly matched except for the haze. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a network that removes haze using hazy images and images without haze that are not paired. The proposed model uses the CycleGAN architecture with this unpaired data. In order to improve the haze removal performance, we propose a dehazing model consisting of a smoothed dilated convolution, a perceptual loss function and a rotational loss function under self-supervised learning. For objective performance evaluation of the proposed techniques, we conducted experiments on the D-HAZY dataset and with real hazy images. The performance of the proposed method was demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative analysis."

The results showed that the image accuracy for the DRL model was higher than that for the supervised deep learning model, and the image noise for the DRL model was smaller than that for the supervised deep learning model. Also, the DRL model reduced the noise of the CT images, which had different characteristics with training images. Therefore, the DRL model is able to reduce image noise as well as maintain the structural information of CT images."

Existing studies related to local festivals have been actively conducted in tourism and related academic fields. Empirical studies to understand the effects of latent variables on local festivals and studies to analyze the regional economic impacts of festivals occupy a large proportion. Despite of practical need, since few researches have been conducted to predict the number of visitors, one of the criteria for evaluating the performance of local festivals, this study developed a model for predicting the number of visitors through various observed variables using a machine learning algorithm and derived its implications.Design/methodology/approach: For a total of 593 festivals held in 2018, 6 variables related to the region considering population size, administrative division, and accessibility, and 15 variables related to the festival such as the degree of publicity and word of mouth, invitation singer, weather and budget were set for the training data in machine learning algorithm.

According to this work, during the monarch’s reign, 153 items of books amounting to over 4,000 fascicles were compiled. Texts compiled under his direct supervision 御定書 alone amount to over 2,000 fascicles. When works compiled by the king’s closest scholar-officials 士大夫 including those affiliated with the Royal Library and Archives 奎章閣 at his order 命撰書 are included here as well, the total amounts to more than 4,000 fascicles. Included in this collection are numerous unique works that provide a glimpse of King Jeongjo’s academic and political opinions such as his poetry collection, Gyeongsa Gangui 經史講義 (records of academic seminars on Confucian classics and ancient East Asian histories between him and his ministers), Simnirok 審理錄 (his trial records), and Ildeungnok 日得錄 (records of his oral statements).Out of the many documents compiled during King Jeongjo’s reign, the Daehak Yuui 大學類義 was the most crucial one as a textbook on statecraft for future rulers. For the effective governance and edification of the populace, the Xiaoxue 小學, Oryun Haengsildo 五倫行實圖, and Hyangnye Happyeon 鄕禮合編 (collection of compacts for self-governing villages) were the most important texts. However, a task that was very important both politically and ideologically was the monarch’s collection of Zhu Xi studies 朱子學 texts for over 20 years and compilation of the best versions. Moreover, he planned to compile a complete edition of the Zhuzi Quanshu 朱子全書 in his late years. When King Jeongjo’s academic tendency is summarized, he saw Zhu Xi studies as the highest learning and truth. This was not simply an academic question but was a question linked to the validity of the ruler’s political power and power management. Because the validity of power was granted through the legitimacy of learning in Joseon, as a politician and the supreme commander, the monarch had no choice but to declare that Zhu Xi studies was the correct learning.The compilation of immense documents and the plan to compile the Zhuzi Quanshu under King Jeongjo’s rule constituted public declarations that the synthesizer of Confucianism, or the inheritor of the ideology’s lineage, was the monarch himself. Indeed, he prided himself on having succeeded to the truth of Confucianism from the wise kings of the three ancient Chinese dynasties, Confucius, and Zhu Xi. King Jeongjo believed that he was capable of practicing the way of a teacher 師道 and the way of a ruler 君道 at the same time, that he could become a true ruler-teacher 君師. He held the belief that only monarchs could become true ruler-teachers. At the same time, he also had the conviction that he had become a ruler-teacher based on his learning and morality and therefore was capable of establishing ji 極, the standard of human life. While kings could become ruler-teachers by cultivating themselves academically and morally, scholar-officials, even if they performed the same task, could not necessary become kings. Consequently, King Jeongjo thought that, in the end, the only one who could bridge the gap between learning and politics, between knowledge and reality, was none other than himself.Both King Jeongjo and contemporary Korean Confucians sought to find the validity of political actions or political power in the perfection of character or the completion of learning. In this respect, they can seem to have stressed morality and learning based on a theory of human nature or metaphysics rather than the uniqueness of politics or power itself. Furthermore, their attitude of pondering on political actions or political power in terms of the moral standard of the perfection of learning and character can be criticize..."

Self-supervision has been regarded as the process of applying all things the supervisee has learned from the supervisor to his(her) own clinical work. However, with the influence of constructionism, self-supervision has come to imply all dynamics, feelings, and thoughts between counselor and client of the present time and the process after counseling sessions. From that point of view, self-supervision cannot be regarded as a future goal but can be a goal from the early stage of supervisee training. Reflection is the core concept of self-supervision, Reflection means to think deeply about something in the past. Also, reflection focuses on relational dynamics, feeling, thinking, belief, value, attitude, and insight of the present time. However, general reflective questions and reflective thinking are not enough to make our counseling become pastoral counseling. For this reason, this study accepts the frame of theological reflection by Patricia O’Connell Killen and John de Beer. Theological reflection pursues the conversation between our experiences and Christian spiritual traditions. A spiritual journal can be a tool to process conversation between our experiences and Christian spiritual traditions and as a vessel to exteriorize and contain insights gained from the process. If counselor trainees use a spiritual journal as a tool of self-supervision from the early stage of clinical training, they can proceed with self-supervision independently even after completing their mandatory training course. In their self-supervision, all things that they had learned from previous supervision will be reactivated. Furthermore, a spiritual journal will contribute to open the field to experience intimacy with God and the dynamic work of the Holy Spirit in pastoral counseling and supervision."

In this study, we propose a deep-learningbased network for deformable medical image registration using unsupervised learning.Materials and Methods: In this paper, we solve the image-registration optimization problem by modelling a function using a convolutional neural network with polyphase decomposition to learn the spatial transformable parameters based on the input images and to generate the registration field. A spatial transformer is used to reconstruct the output warped image while imposing smoothness constraints on the registration field. With polyphase decomposition, our proposed method learns more features based on the input image pairs without the need for any ground-truth registration field.Results: Experimental results using 3D T1 brain MRI volume scans and compared with state-of-the-art image-registration methods demonstrated that our method provides better 3D-image registration.Conclusion: Our proposed method uses less computational time in registering unseen pairs of input images during inference and can be applied for other unimodal image registration tasks, and the hyper-parameters can be adjusted for the specific task."

Such abnormal neurological interaction might provoke a deleterious side-effect, which is called cybersickness. In order to guarantee viewer’s safety, producer and provider have to predict the degree of cybersickness prior to regulating the related attribute of a VR content. Unfortunately, previous researches on cybersickness have only focused on the mutually independent factors. To cope with this problem, we propose a novel scheme for prediction of the level of cybersickness by employing the supervised learning. Towards this, 52 synthetic VR scenes are newly generated, and then the subjective opinions are collected through a large-scale clinical evaluation with participation of 150 volunteers. To capture the robust representations of cybersickness, 17 spatial perceptual features are extracted including the processed raw data which represent the visual-vestibular sensory conflict, the estimated visual sensitivity and complexity from RGB images, and the depth information. Moreover, the extracted spatial perceptual features are transformed to the temporal perceptual features by deploying four pooling methods which reflects the human’s visual characteristics. The extracted features are regressed onto the ground-truth (i.e., the rated score), thus the prediction of quantified level of cybersickness can be achieved by using the trained model, and whose predictive performance has ∼76% correlated relationship with the subjective opinions."

However, electrodes must be placed in the correct positions, and due to the high volume of noise, professional knowledge and accurate hardware design are required. In this paper, a system is constructed to improve the sEMG signal measurement environment by producing small multichannel sEMG modules. In addition, deep neural network supervised learning algorithms are implemented to estimate the torque using only the sEMG signal. Based on this, we analyze the organization of algorithms, the processing of the sEMG data, and how the number of channels aff ects learning. The optimal deep natural network model selected by the analysis is implanted to embedded after learning. The implanted model performs a portable real-time torque optimization (PRTE) according to the sEMG signal entered.

Automated Analysis Approach for the Detection of High Survivable Ransomware,2020,"['Ransomware', 'supervised machine learning', 'Support Vector Machine', 'Artificial Neural Network', 'Term Frequency-Inverse document frequency']",,"Ransomware is malicious software that encrypts the user-related files and data and holds them to ransom. Such attacks have become one of the serious threats to cyberspace. The avoidance techniques that ransomware employs such as obfuscation and/or packing makes it difficult to analyze such programs statically. Although many ransomware detection studies have been conducted, they are limited to a small portion of the attack's characteristics. To this end, this paper proposed a framework for the behavioral-based dynamic analysis of high survivable ransomware (HSR) with integrated valuable feature sets. Term Frequency-Inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) was employed to select the most useful features from the analyzed samples. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were utilized to develop and implement a machine learning-based detection model able to recognize certain behavioral traits of high survivable ransomware attacks. Experimental evaluation indicates that the proposed framework achieved an area under the ROC curve of 0.987 and a few false positive rates 0.007. The experimental results indicate that the proposed framework can detect high survivable ransomware in the early stage accurately."

The subjects of the simulated instructional improvements were 45 students in their third year in the department of early childhood education and three kindergarten field experts who provided supervision. To meet the objectives, the action researchers collected various data to conduct an inductive analysis. These data included the contents of conferences with kindergarten field experts, videos of the primary and secondary simulated instructions by pre-service early childhood teachers, lesson plans and teaching aids for the primary and secondary simulated instructions, reflective journals for simulated instructional improvement, and research notes by the researchers. The implementation process to improve the simulated instructions in connection with field experts was classified into three stages. The first stage was planning, including the reflection and correction of existing simulated instructions as well as the fundamental consultation with field experts for instructional improvement. The second stage of execution involved preparation for the primary simulated instruction, execution and recording, and conducting an assessment conference on the primary simulated instruction with fellow pre-service teachers and university professors. The third stage was re-execution, where pre-service early childhood teachers discussed the direction of the secondary simulated instruction with field experts and prepared for the instruction, based on the primary simulated instruction execution and assessment process. Subsequently, the secondary simulated instruction execution and re-reflection process was followed through in-person guidance by the field experts visiting the university with the aim of instructional improvement. As a result of the simulated instructional improvement process implemented in connection with field experts, the pre-service early childhood teachers came to be able to more precisely recognize the current status of the kindergarten field. In addition, they were able to understand instructional improvement in the direction possible to more effectively interact with the actual learning level of preschoolers. All of these procedures also provided both field experts and pre-service early childhood teachers, including the action researchers, with an opportunity to enhance teaching professionalism. For the action researchers, this study served as a insightful turning point where they could assess the foundation, plans, interrelation, and development possibility for field-related simulated instructional improvement with field experts, based on the results of this study. Moreover, they were able to grow into high-quality teaching professionals specializing in training pre-service early childhood teachers."

中国上市公司员工持股制度问题研究,2020,"['Employee stock ownership', 'A listed company', 'Shareholder rights', 'Employee motivation', '员工持股', '上市公司', '股东权利', '员工激励']",,"Employee stock ownership system (esop) is an employee incentive system originated from the United States. It is a system whereby the company distributes part of the shares to employees in a certain form according to established rules, and the owner shares the ownership and future earnings with employees. In practice, there is not only a conflict of interest between the company and the employees, but also a conflict caused by the dual identity of the employees. How to resolve this contradiction and prevent the legal risks caused by the implementation of the employee shareholding system has become an urgent problem to be solved. From the perspective of practice and combining with theory, this paper takes the employee shareholding system of listed companies as the research object, focuses on the overall system construction of the employee shareholding system of listed companies, learns experience from relevant laws and regulations of employee shareholding system outside the region, and puts forward Suggestions for the construction of relevant legal system in China. The employee stock ownership system has been developed for decades in China, and so far three shareholding modes have been formed, namely: trust shareholding mode, limited partnership shareholding mode and corporate enterprise mode. The mode of trust shareholding mainly establishes a trust shareholding platform according to the provisions of the trust law and manages the employee shareholding plan in the form of trust fund. Limited partnership shareholding mode is a kind of shareholding mode according to the partnership law. It is a way to establish multiple limited partnerships in a nested way, so as to establish and manage employee shareholding plan with minimum cost. The shareholding mode of the company system requires the enterprise to manage the employee shareholding plan by establishing a joint stock limited company and using the articles of association according to the provisions of the company law. Through the analysis of the employee stock ownership system in China, it is found that there are such problems as the high proportion of senior executives, the lack of supervision of the employee stock ownership system, the imperfect exit mechanism and the obvious externalization of employee stock. In view of these problems, it is suggested that the employee stock ownership system should be supervised and managed at both central and local levels. From the central level, the “management measures of employee stock ownership system” is formulated, and the problems in the acquisition of employee stock, equity exercise and withdrawal of employee stock ownership system are regulated, and the regulatory system of employee stock ownership system is regulated from the two aspects of clarifying the regulatory subject and improving the internal supervision. It is suggested that the local government issue relevant regulations to guide the development of esop in the region. The paper consists of introduction, text and conclusion, forming a relatively complete article system. In the first chapter of the main body, the general concept of the ESOP of listed companies is expounded, and from the concept, characteristics and significance of employee stock ownership, we have a comprehensive understanding of the ESOP of listed companies. The second chapter focuses on the domestic employee shareholding system, first, to review the development process of employee shareholding system in our country, and through the analysis of employee shareholding system in our country listed company of three models, and our country listed company employees within the ESOP, exercise, and exit the three stages of law system, it is concluded that China’s listed company employee shareholding system in the legislative and regulatory shortcomings. Next to the employee shareholding system outside of comparative analysis, from the perspective of comparative law research on the outside of employee shareholding system mode and the legal system is analyzed, in expanding the scope of the shareholding employees subject and ensure employee stock shareholders' rights and interests of the shareholders, complete and comprehensive of employee shareholding system legislation protecting and comprehensive guide, make the employee shareholding system perfecting of our country. But because the countries outside with economic system and legal system in our country some difference in different degree, therefore to the outside of employee shareholding system take the essence to the dregs, from standard system, establish the regulators and perfect the laws and regulations and so on omni-directional constructing China’s legal system of employee shareholding stake, promote the development of employee shareholding system of listed companies in our country."

It is easy to use since it does not require a mesh, in contrast with the finite element method. However, the method of finite spheres uses rational interpolation functions based on the Shepard functions. Thus, it requires more integration points to integrate the element matrices accurately, resulting in poor computational efficiency. In this regard, research on Gaussian quadrature for the method of finite spheres has been conducted, however, it still implies a large computational cost. Therefore, we propose an algorithm for optimizing the weights of Gaussian quadrature using supervised learning.

The results establish that the number of integration points used in the Gaussian quadrature can be reduced, thereby significantly reducing the computational cost."

The analysis discusses and compares the 2018 major work plan to that of year 2020. The study analyzed the current status of supervision in terms of goals, contents, methods, and subjects of the 17 Provincial of Education.  The results are as follow: First, the term, “supervision” was first used in one major work plan (Ulsan) in 2018, to three by 2020 (Incheon, Gwangju, Gangwon-do, Korea). Second, compared to 2018, the number of supervision methods increased in 2020. There was an increase in the autonomous and customizing supervision methods. There was a decrease in consulting and supportive supervision methods. Third, five education offices in 2018 included supervision term goals for their major work plans (Seoul, Busan, Daejeon, South Chungcheong and South Jeolla provinces), but only four education offices included supervision goals in 2020 (Seoul, Busan, North Chungcheong and South Gyeongsang provinces). Fourth, in regard to supervision work, the subjects of specialized learning community and the provincial education officers on the subject of supervision were highly mentioned. Through the above analysis results, the transfer of supervision authority from the Office of Education to the school, a supervision method that varies with occasion arises, a change to low position of Consulting Supervision, and the supervision based on learning community were confirmed."

Recently, the field of natural language processing has been actively researched using pre-trained language representation models with a large amount of corpus. In particular, the named entity recognition, which is one of the fields of natural language processing, uses a supervised learning method, which requires a large amount of training dataset and computation. Reinforcement learning is a method that learns through trial and error experience without initial data and is closer to the process of human learning than other machine learning methodologies and is not much applied to the field of natural language processing yet. It is often used in simulation environments such as Atari games and AlphaGo. BERT is a general-purpose language model developed by Google that is pre-trained on large corpus and computational quantities. Recently, it is a language model that shows high performance in the field of natural language processing research and shows high accuracy in many downstream tasks of natural language processing. In this paper, we propose a new named entity recognition DeNERT model using two deep learning models, DQN and BERT. The proposed model is trained by creating a learning environment of reinforcement learning model based on language expression which is the advantage of the general language model. The DeNERT model trained in this way is a faster inference time and higher performance model with a small amount of training dataset. Also, we validate the performance of our model’s named entity recognition performance through experiments."

The National Artificial Intelligence R&D Strategy, published in 2019, emphasizes the importance of artificial intelligence education for K-12 students. It also mentions STEM education, AI convergence curriculum, and budget for supporting the development of teaching materials and tools. However, it is necessary to create a new type of curriculum at a time when artificial intelligence curriculum has never existed before. With many attempts and discussions going very fast in all countries on almost the same starting line. Also, there is no suitable professor for K-12 students, and it is difficult to make K-12 students understand the concept of AI. In particular, it is difficult to teach elementary school students through professional programming in AI education. It is also difficult to learn tools that can teach AI concepts. In this paper, we propose an educational model for elementary school students to improve their understanding of AI through play or experience. This an experiential education model that combineds exploratory learning and discovery learning using multi-intelligence and the PLAY teaching-learning model to undertand the importance of data training or data required for AI education. This educational model is designed to learn how a computer that knows only binary numbers through UA recognizes images. Through code.org, students were trained to learn AI robots and configured to understand data bias like play.

In this paper, a number of studies have been analyzed to classify and compare the research directions. We examined a technical challenges after BERT. In the pre-training process, self-supervised learning is performed, which relies entirely on training data. If we introduce the linguistic knowledge in the course of the training, it would be possible to get better result more effectively. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a method to insert external knowledge such as linguistic information in the training process. The mask language model and the next sentence prediction are being used in BERT's pre-training tasks. Though, to get much deeper understanding of the natural language, some other effective methods are to be studied and developed. Lastly, we should aim to develop eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) technology in natural language processing, helping us look into the transparent processing. The pre-trained language model focuses on the development of skills that can be used for all the tasks of natural language understanding. A lot of researches are focused on how to adapt language model effectively to downstream tasks based on common language models, even with the case with little data. It is also hoped that the technical analysis reviewed in this study will provide linguists and computer researchers with an opportunity to understand recent technological  achievements in the field of natural language processing and to seek joint research."

Development and Optimization of Deep Belief Networks Applied for Academic Performance Prediction with Larger Datasets,2020,"['Student performance', 'Deep learning', 'Restricted Boltzmann machine', 'Deep belief network', 'Feature selection', 'Hyperparameters', 'Regularization']",,"Deep learning has recently attracted increasing interest for several applications, and great progress has been made. This paper introduces a novel application of a deep learning framework called deep belief networks (DBNs) that can be used to predict the predicting academic performance of larger datasets. First, unsupervised training is considered a so-called pre-training section. The stacked restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) was trained to obtain the trained weights instead of random initial weights. Subsequently, supervised learning was adopted using backpropagation in the fine-tuning section to classify the student performance levels. An optimization approach for improving the classification performance of the proposed DBN was proposed. The optimization approach consisted of using a feature selection method to obtain the optimal feature subset, optimizing the DBN model with the optimal values of the hyperparameters, and applying the L2-regularization method for weight decay. The experiment was carried out with two phases. Phase1 was implemented with an actual dataset. Phase 2 was then implemented with four artificial datasets of increasing sizes. Many experiments were performed independently on each dataset. With a larger dataset, the improved DBN generated the highest accuracy and lowest root mean square error with more accuracy and effectiveness than the other proposed algorithms."

Image classification is to determine which category the given image belongs to. Since the image classification is a typical supervised learning, test images and the corresponding answers, i.e., labels are also given. And, with the given test images and labels, a neural network is trained to minimize a loss function defined by error between the label and the inference result. Therefore, as the loss decreases, the inference accuracy increases. As a result, the accuracy is a criteria of the performance of the neural network in image classification. In this paper, a new method for high accuracy image classification is suggested. Authors thinks that recognizing things mean seeing the shape of the things. With the intuition, in the proposed method, additional edge information is applied to the image and around 3% accuracy improvement is achieved in the experiment. In order to clarify the improvement, compared feature maps in the hidden layers are visualized and analyzed. And, it is also confirmed that the feature map of the proposed method is more clear and sharp than that of the conventional one. Another merit of the proposed method is that this method can easily improve the accuracy of the conventionally existing neural networks through the transfer learning because the proposed method just modifies the first layer of the conventional neural networks."
Intelligent Hybrid Fusion Algorithm with Vision Patterns for Generation of Precise Digital Road Maps in Self-driving Vehicles,2020,"['Intelligence', 'Vision', 'Deep learning', 'High precision digital map', 'Self-driving vehicles']",,"Due to the significant increase in the use of autonomous car technology, it is essential to integrate this technology with high-precision digital map data containing more precise and accurate roadway information, as compared to existing conventional map resources, to ensure the safety of self-driving operations. While existing map technologies may assist vehicles in identifying their locations via Global Positioning System, it is however difficult to update the environmental changes of roadways in these maps. Roadway vision algorithms can be useful for building autonomous vehicles that can avoid accidents and detect real-time location changes. We incorporate a hybrid architectural design that combines unsupervised classification of vision data with supervised joint fusion classification to achieve a better noise-resistant algorithm. We identify, via a deep learning approach, an intelligent hybrid fusion algorithm for fusing multimodal vision feature data for roadway classifications and characterize its improvement in accuracy over unsupervised identifications using image processing and supervised vision classifiers. We analyzed over 93,000 vision frame data collected from a test vehicle in real roadways. The performance indicators of the proposed hybrid fusion algorithm are successfully evaluated for the generation of roadway digital maps for autonomous vehicles, with a recall of 0.94, precision of 0.96, and accuracy of 0.92."

Document Image Binarization by GAN with Unpaired Data Training,2020,"['document image binarization', 'unpaired training data', 'gan', 'unsupervised learning']",,"Data is critical in deep learning but the scarcity of data often occurs in research, especially in the preparation of the paired training data. In this paper, document image binarization with unpaired data is studied by introducing adversarial learning, excluding the need for supervised or labeled datasets. However, the simple extension of the previous unpaired training to binarization inevitably leads to poor performance compared to paired data training. Thus, a new deep learning approach is proposed by introducing a multidiversity of higher quality generated images. In this paper, a two-stage model is proposed that comprises the generative adversarial network (GAN) followed by the U-net network. In the first stage, the GAN uses the unpaired image data to create paired image data. With the second stage, the generated paired image data are passed through the U-net network for binarization. Thus, the trained U-net becomes the binarization model during the testing. The proposed model has been evaluated over the publicly available DIBCO dataset and it outperforms other techniques on unpaired training data. The paper shows the potential of using unpaired data for binarization, for the first time in the literature, which can be further improved to replace paired data training for binarization in the future."

However, it was confirmed that teaching theory, strategies and benefits for learners were not considered. This study suggests that teaching-learning theories can provide a useful frame for evidence-based art therapy education and that research on teaching-learning models that take into account the characteristics of art therapy should be considered."

Therefore, it is crucial to accurately predict breaker index such as breaking wave height and breaking depth, when designing coastal structures. Numerous scientific efforts have been made in the past by many researchers to identify and predict the breaking phenomenon. Representative studies on wave breaking provide many empirical formulas for the prediction of breaking index, mainly through hydraulic model experiments. However, the existing empirical formulas for breaking index determine the coefficients of the assumed equation through statistical analysis of data under the assumption of a specific equation. In this paper, we applied a representative linear-based supervised machine learning algorithms that show high predictive performance in various research fields related to regression or classification problems. Based on the used machine learning methods, a model for prediction of the breaking index is developed from previously published experimental data on the breaking wave, and a new linear equation for prediction of breaker index is presented from the trained model. The newly proposed breaker index formula showed similar predictive performance compared to the existing empirical formula, although it was a simple linear equation."

In addition, a cyber security framework and a security control center were opened for systematic prevention and response. However, due to the document-oriented cybersecurity framework and limited security personnel, the reality is that it is difficult to escape from the control form of fragmentary infringement response of important detection events of TMS / IPS.

Survival models are also used to predict plant failures based on past anomaly cycles. In particular, special machine that reflect the fluid flow and process characteristics of chemical plants are connected to hundreds or thousands of sensors, so there are not many factors that need to be considered, such as process and material data as well as application of derivative variables. In this paper, the data were preprocessed through time series anomaly detection based on unsupervised learning to predict the abnormalities of these special machine. Next, clustering results reflecting clustering-based data characteristics were applied to produce additional variables, and a learning data set was created based on the history of past facility abnormalities. Finally, the prediction methodology based on the supervised learning algorithm was applied, and the model update was confirmed to improve the accuracy of the prediction of facility failure.

Multi-Label Classification of Historical Documents by Using Hierarchical Attention Networks,2020,"['Deep learning', 'Recurrent neural network', 'Text analysis', 'Big data', 'History']",,"The quantitative analysis of digitized historical documents has begun in earnest in recent years. Text classification is of particular importance for quantitative historical analysis because it helps to search literature efficiently and to determine the important subjects of a particular age. While numerous historians have joined together to classify large-scale historical documents, consistent classification among individual researchers has not been achieved. In this study, we present a classification method for large-scale historical data that uses a recently developed supervised learning algorithm called the Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN). By applying various classification methods to the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty (AJD), we show that HAN is more accurate than conventional techniques with word-frequency-based features. HAN provides the extent that a particular sentence or word contributes to the classification process through a quantitative value called `attention'. We extract the representative keywords from various categories by using the attention mechanism and show the evolution of the keywords over the 472-year span of the AJD. Our results reveal that largely two groups of event categories are found in the AJD. In one group, the representative keywords of the categories were stable over long periods while the keywords in the other group varied rapidly, exhibiting repeatedly changing characteristics of the categories. Observing such macroscopic changes of representative words may provide insight into how a particular topic changes over a historical period."

To extract evaluativesentiment sentences, we proposed a novel approach that clusters the barrages from the same commenter to solvethe problem of scattering the information for each barrage. The method developed in this paper contains twosubtasks: in the data preprocessing phase, we cluster the sentences from the same commenter and removeunavailable sentences; and we use a semi-supervised machine learning approach, the naïve Bayes algorithm, toanalyze the sentiment of the barrage. According to our experimental results, this method shows that it performswell in analyzing the sentiment of online webcast barrages."

However, it is very likely to cause an accident such as a collision or fall, due to external environmental factors, and research is needed to increase safety. To prevent such risks, UAVs are often equipped with sensors such as laser scanners or cameras. But laser scanners are very heavy and consume high power. Stereo cameras are much lighter and use less power than laser scanners, making them ideal for use in small UAV environments. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a method for estimating the disparity map using a stereo camera and deep learning without using a LiDAR(Lighting Detection And Ranging). The proposed method constructs semi-supervision based neural network to estimate disparity maps. This algorithm can estimate more precise disparity maps than existing matching algorithms."

Cascaded Residual Dense Networks for Dynamic MR Imaging with Edge-Enhanced Loss Constraint,2020,"['Dynamic MR imaging', 'Deep learning', 'Compressed sensing', 'Dense', 'Local feature', 'Global feature', 'Total variation']",,"Dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has generated great research interest, because it can provide both spatial and temporal information for clinical diagnosis.However, slow imaging speed or long scanning time is still a challenge for dynamic MR imaging. Most existing methods reconstruct dynamic MR images from incomplete k -space data under the guidance of compressed sensing (CS) or lowrank theory, which suffer from long iterative reconstruction time. Recently, deep learning has shown great potential in accelerating dynamic MR. Our previous work proposed a dynamic MR imaging method with both k-space and spatial prior knowledge integrated via multi-supervised network training. Nevertheless, there was still some smoothing needed in the reconstructed images at high acceleration. In this work, we propose cascaded residual dense networks for dynamic MR imaging with edge-enhanced loss constraint, dubbed cascaded residual dense networks (CRDN).Specifically, the cascaded residual dense networks fully exploit the hierarchical features from all the convolutional layers with both local and global feature fusion.We further use the higher-degree total variation loss function, which has the edge enhancement properties, for training the networks."

The output vector consists of six simulation parameters that have a significant influence on deriving the corresponding drape result. To generate a plausible and unbiased training data set, we first collect simulation parameters for 400 knit fabrics and generate a Gaussian Mixed Model (GMM) generation model from them. Next, a large number of simulation parameters are randomly sampled from the GMM model, and cloth simulation is performed for each sampled simulation parameter to create a virtual static drape. The generated training data is fitted with a log-linear regression model. To evaluate our method, we check the accuracy of the training results with a test data set and compare the visual similarity of the simulated drapes."

However, the meaning of some words can be different or even the original meaning can disappear across domains. As such, many sentiment words are likely to depend on a specific domain. For example, the verb phrase “slept well” usually has a negative meaning, while it has a positive meaning in movie domains. Thus, given a particular domain such as hotel, the sentiment lexicon should be constructed so that many of the domain-dependent words reflect the meaning of the domain. Using the domain-dependent sentiment lexicon will render more accurate results than using existing sentiment lexicons that do not consider domain-dependent words in the sentiment analysis. To build the domain-dependent sentiment lexicons, various studies have been presented, but there are many limitations including the human intervention and the use of local information rather than contextual information. In this paper, we propose a novel method of automatically constructing a domain-dependent sentiment lexicon based on the global and contextual information and an existing sentiment lexicon (i.e., KNU sentiment lexicon, Glove vector, Conjunction relation)."

In order to recognize the same pattern at all times despite the electrode locations, the data acquisition of the circular structure is proposed so that all sEMG channels can be connected to one another. For the performance verification of the sEMG pattern recognition and classification using the developed algorithm, several experiments are conducted. First, although there are no differences in the sEMG signals themselves, the similar patterns are much better identified in the case of the circular structure algorithm than that of conventional linear ones. Second, a comparative analysis is shown with the supervised learning schemes such as MLP, CNN, and LSTM. In the results, the classification recognition accuracy of the circular structure is above 98% in all postures. It is much higher than the results obtained when the linear structure is used. The recognition difference between the circular and linear structures was the biggest with about 4% when the MLP network was used."
Estimation of Maximum Strains and Loads in Aircraft Landing Using Artificial Neural Network,2020,['Structural health monitoring \xa0· Hard landing \xa0· Artifi cial neural network \xa0· Supervised learning'],,"Hard landings account for a large proportion of aircraft accidents and are generally judged by the intuition of pilots. For this reason, there are frequent false judgments that lead to unnecessary and costly ground inspections. False judgments can be reduced significantly if detailed load information is available, such as strains or loads on critical areas of aircraft structures. This study used an artificial neural network (ANN) to develop a numerical model that can estimate the maximum strains for areas of interest and landing loads from basic flight parameters. The results can be used to provide the required detailed load information. An efficient and accurate landing simulation model was constructed and used to build reliable datasets for training. Basic flight parameters from immediately after touchdown were used as input data for training, and the corresponding maximum values of strains and landing loads were obtained from the landing simulation model as target data for training. This information was used to train the ANNs with the Levenberg–Marquardt backpropagation algorithm. A performance evaluation using test data confirmed that the trained ANNs can successfully estimate strains and landing loads with sufficient accuracy."

In this article, the author shows the curent situation of contact arangements decided by courts in Korea, and then studies the contemporary condition of contact arangements and supervised contact under the new policies and legal systems which came into force in 2009 in BGB and SGB VII. These put emphasis on child welfare, especialy with regard to safety of the child. The author has concluded that it is necesary for Korea to both improve the support system for parties to make reasonable contact arangements and implement these contact arangements consistently in order to promote each child’ welfare and the best interests of the child."

HLM 8.0소프트웨어를 활용한 다수준 음이항 회귀분석 결과, 특정 차수의 집단괴롭힘 피해수준이 증가할수록 해당차수 비행의 정도가 증가하였으며, 평균적으로 친구의 비행성이 높을수록 이러한 효과는 증폭되었다. 즉, 평균적인 비행친구와의 차별적 접촉수준은 특정차수 집단괴롭힘 피해수준이 해당차수 비행의 정도에 미치는 영향을 유의하게 조절하였다. 이러한 결과는 비행친구와의 부정적 관계(집단 괴롭힘 피해) 뿐 아니라 긍정적 관계(차별적 접촉) 역시 중첩적으로 다문화청소년의 비행을 증가하는 방향으로 작용한다는 사실을 말해준다. 이상의 연구결과를 바탕으로 이론적, 정책적 의의를 논하였다.","Multicultural youth in Korea are more likely to suffer from bullying victimization than other youth. If their parents neglect supervision, they will also be more likely to hang out with delinquent peers. Based on general strain theory and social learning theory, this study analyzed the interaction effects of bullying victimization and differential associations with delinquent peers on delinquency using data from the 4th, 5th, and 6th waves of a multicultural youth panel survey. As a result of multi-level negative binomial regression analysis using HLM 8.0 software, as the level of bullying victimization of a specific wave increased, the level of delinquency at the same wave also increased. Also, this effect was amplified as the level of average delinquent peer association across waves increased. This result shows that both negative association with delinquent peers (bullying victimization) and positive association with delinquent peers (differential association) cumulatively increase the level of multicultural youth’s delinquency. With this result, theoretical and practical implications are discussed."
DeepCleanNet: Training Deep Convolutional Neural Network with Extremely Noisy Labels,2020,"['Image Classification', 'Noisy Labels', 'Corrupted Labels', 'CNN.']",,"In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been successfully implemented in different tasks of computer vision. Since CNN models are the representatives of supervised learning algorithms, they demand large amount of data in order to train the classifiers. Thus, obtaining data with correct labels is imperative to attain the state-of-the-art performance of the CNN models. However, labelling datasets is quite tedious and expensive process, therefore real-life datasets often exhibit incorrect labels. Although the issue of poorly labelled datasets has been studied before, we have noticed that the methods are very complex and hard to reproduce. Therefore, in this research work, we propose Deep CleanNet - a considerably simple system that achieves competitive results when compared to the existing methods. We use K-means clustering algorithm for selecting data with correct labels and train the new dataset using a deep CNN model. The technique achieves competitive results in both training and validation stages. We conducted experiments using MNIST database of handwritten digits with 50% corrupted labels and achieved up to 10 and 20% increase in training and validation sets accuracy scores, respectively."

In order to maintain the impact of big data on safety evaluation classified in four stages, risk identification must be conducted. Next, the hazard characteristics should be described. In addition, more accurate information collection should be conducted by evaluating the disclosure of the evaluation data and describing the characteristics of risk.In relation to the improvement of the legal system of food safety management by applying big data, first, the standardization of the food management supervision and legal system should be drastically progressed. In particular, the standards for information processing and distribution of agricultural products in rural areas should be significantly complemented. In addition, the type and scope of safety evaluation, evaluation time, and evaluation unit must also be determined by law. It is also necessary to seriously discuss the extent to which the information is collected and the degree of sharing of the collected data. In the process, there should be no excessive infringement or misunderstanding of personal information. For this, first of all, a dual system should be established, led by a government agency in relation to food safety management, and actively involved with food safety management entities. Domestic and international cooperation measures should be prepared.Providing user feedback should also be provided appropriately. The confusion due to the overlapping management of the governmental organizations should also accurately share the roles according to their respective tasks. First of all, it is necessary to construct a big data platform for food tracking, because there has been no unified tracking system related to food distribution. Five institutions, including home, school, city office of education, market supervisory authority and franchise department, monitor channels according to remote remote control methods, learn platform-directed management supervision, build a reporting system when finding issues at each stage, interlock three-step actions and take action results A five-dimensional food safety management system called satisfaction evaluation must be established.In the case of a food tracking system represented by beef using a blockchain, the parts that can be a certain topic are as follows. Since Ethereum is a safe and authoritative authority in blockchain technology, it is necessary to actively utilize Ethereum. In the process of promoting the beef supply chain tracking system, the authority management of system users is an issue. With this in mind, the Ethereum system does not have a solution on its own, but will be able to satisfy the actual demand by adding a rights management model outside the blockchain system.Speaking of the consumer, through the sequence number of the food packaging, detailed distribution information corresponding to it in the database protected by the Consumer Protection Agency will be investigated, and if the integrity of the information is checked, the key information stored in the blockchain and database search Data is compared and if both are equally unchanged since the system’s registration of the data, data can be considered complete. Two ways of the Ethereum platform can store data on the blockchain. First, the block is considered as a unit element, and data is added within every single block. Second, it takes the form of a transaction and sends the data to the blockchain. More research should be conducted on tracking systems such as the Java Web system."

The most important issue in the medical field shortly after the founding of Joseon was who would be responsible for medical practice, such as the establishment and implementation of medical policy, medical learning, and patient treatment.The founding forces of Joseon, who witnessed the problems of medical care at the end of Goryeo, educated the young people of the Yangin (良人) class and instated the current literary officials into medical affairs. Subsequently, under the reign of King Sejong (世宗), the medical learning officer program (醫書習讀 官) was conducted. The program was a system for training medical professionals by intensively educating the young people of the ruling class.This position to train medical professionals at the national level can be called a well-informed Confucianist theory (通儒論). The position of this theory that Confucian scholars should be fluent in all fields is also seen in the Chilhak (七 學, seven schools) under the reign of King Sejo (世祖).The well-informed Confucianist theory was strongly opposed by the Yangban(兩班) class, including current officials who promoted the discrimination theory (職分論). They argued that everyone has a fixed position, and that the medical bureau was the position that professional medical personnel were in charge of.These two positions were challenged throughout the 15th century until a compromise was reached. The compromise was that the ruling class would be in charge of the supervision of the medical bureau and a part of the medical education, while professional medical personnel would be in charge of the practice of medical care such as patient treatment, medical book compilation, and medical profession."

Most of the previous studies overlooked this problem and focused only on improving the structure of their artificial neural networks. As a result, a number of new attacks were frequently classified as normal traffic, and attack traffic classification performance was severly degraded. On the other hand, the softmax function, which outputs the probability that each class is correctly classified in the multi-class classification as a result, also has a significant impact on the classification performance because it fails to calculate the softmax score properly for a new type of attack traffic that has not been trained. In this paper, based on this characteristic of softmax function, we propose an efficient method to improve the classification performance against new types of attacks by classifying traffic with a probability below a certain level as attacks, and demonstrate the efficiency of our approach through experiments."

His supervision was given from time to time in a form of Dhamma Debate(擧揚) which was a kind of active discussion about Dhamma between the master and the practitioners. He grafted onto the Ganhwaseon discipline three elements of Great Faith(大信心: deep belief in the truth), Great Indignation(大憤心: indignation for oneself who can’t attain mastery) and Great Doubt(大疑心: deep question for disciplines). In other words, he passed down the spirit of Great Doubt & Enlightenment. He was longing for the bhikkhunis to keep the tradition of Seon practice and to succeed the identity of Joseon Buddhism as integrity of national value. That was the reason why he handed down the poetic writings & praising to the bhikkhunis which stimulated their devotion of learning, and inquired them into the development of Seon practice.On the other hand their Spirit succeeded the right disciplines and wisdom of Buddha, they rejected the Japanese style buddhism or Japanese colonialism against the Joseon Buddhism, which became integrated the Spirit of the Times.Like this, Ven.

Impurity profiling and chemometric analysis of methamphetamine seizures in Korea,2020,"['methamphetamine', 'impurity profiling', 'chemometric analysis', 'GC-FID/MS']",,"Methamphetamine (MA) is currently the most abused illicit drug in Korea. MA is produced by chemical synthesis, and the final target drug that is produced contains small amounts of the precursor chemicals, intermediates, and by-products. To identify and quantify these trace compounds in MA seizures, a practical and feasible approach for conducting chromatographic fingerprinting with a suite of traditional chemometric methods and recently introduced machine learning approaches was examined. This was achieved using gas chromatography (GC) coupled with a flame ionization detector (FID) and mass spectrometry (MS). Following appropriate examination of all the peaks in 71 samples, 166 impurities were selected as the characteristic components. Unsupervised (principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and K-means clustering) and supervised (partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), support vector machines (SVM), and deep neural network (DNN) with Keras) chemometric techniques were employed for classifying the 71 MA seizures. The results of the PCA, HCA, K-means clustering, PLS-DA, OPLS-DA, SVM, and DNN methods for quality evaluation were in good agreement. However, the tested MA seizures possessed distinct features, such as chirality, cutting agents, and boiling points. The study indicated that the established qualitative and semi-quantitative methods will be practical and useful analytical tools for characterizing trace compounds in illicit MA seizures. Moreover, they will provide a statistical basis for identifying the synthesis route, sources of supply, trafficking routes, and connections between seizures, which will support drug law enforcement agencies in their effort to eliminate organized MA crime."

In this paper, clustering algorithm which is one of non-supervised learning algorithms was assessed in order to check whether using only T, N, M stages with a data science method is effective for classifying the group of patients in the aspect of survival days. The final stage groups and T, N, M stage clustering groups of lung cancer patients were compared by using the cox proportional hazard model. It is confirmed that the accuracy of prediction of survival days with only T, N, M stages becomes higher than the accuracy with the final stages of patients. Especially, the accuracy of prediction of survival days with clustering of T, N, M stages improves when more or less clusters are analyzed than the seven clusters which is same to the number of final stage of AJCC."

The survey was conducted online and data was analyzed using the SPSS 20.0 program. The results of the study are as follows. First, the intervention of applied behavior analysis for children was applied early and frequently. In addition, parents and special education teachers' learning experiences for applied behavior analysis had many 'reading books and papers', but the biggest effect was 'expert supervision or advice'. Second, as a barrier to implementing applied behavior analysis, parents highly recognized the intervention aspect and special education teachers recognized the support aspect. As a barrier to choice and proposal of intervention, parents highly perceived the 'budgetary problem'. The attitudes of parents and special education teachers toward the applied behavior analysis were recognized, but it were perceived that it took a considerable amount of time to implement the strategy. Third, parents and special education teachers recognized the need for collaboration between relevant persons and related fields in order to effectively apply the applied behavior analysis. In addition, parents and special education teachers needed various learning opportunities and supports to implementation the intervention. The results of this study are meaningful in providing basic data confirming social perception for effective application of applied behavior analysis by quantifying the perception of applied behavior analysis."
Optimum LED Coverage Utilization in OCC for Effective Communication with Mobile Robot,2020,"['Bit-error rate (BER)', 'image sensor', 'light emitting diode (LED)', 'mobile robot (MR)', 'tilt angle.']",,"Optical camera communication (OCC) is a promisingtechnology for camera-mounted mobile robots (MRs), where it canuse its camera to communicate with light-emitting diode (LED) infrastructures. Due to the limited angle of view of current commercial cameras used in MRs, the cameras cannot detect LED everywhere inside an area illuminated by an LED; hence, much ofthe illumination surface remains unutilized. Herein, we propose anautomatic camera inflection algorithm to successfully detect LEDanywhere inside an LED cell (the total coverage area illuminatedby LED). The inflection mechanism is a supervised learning approach. The technique utilizes the coordinate information (i.e., Xand Y coordinates) of an LED cell, which is further employed totrack the position of the LED. The coordinate data is automaticallyupdated when the MR travels from one position to another. Furthermore, we perform simulations that include a discussion on tiltangle variation with increasing distance traveled by the MR and aperformance analysis that demonstrates the importance and feasibility of the developed algorithm. Finally, a testbed prototype forOCC is implemented to demonstrate the proof of angle measurement theory and bit-error-rate performance of the proposed system."

He succeeded to Gi, Jeong-jin's unique thinking system of the one principle with different manifestations (理一分殊) and idea of protecting the orthodox and repelling the heterodox through this, and based on Nosa studies, he understood the theory of Sinmyeongsado(神明舍圖) in Nammyeong and the theory that Hangju(寒洲) Lee JinsangYi(李震相) claimed that the mind was reasonable.Since then, Jeong, Jae-gyu has deepened the aspect of the theory of Li in the theory of Nosa having academic discussions between alumni and academic arguments with Ganjae Jeonwu.He established the aspect of the theory of Li in the theory of human nature and mind as well as the theory of i and ki by expanding the one principle with different manifestations more. He integrated mind of supervision and wonderful operation with human nature as systematic organization (條理) and true nature (實體) saying that mind is supervision and suggestion, nature of humaneness, rightness, ritual decorum, and wisdom means when mind is expressed and gets to be different, which is the expansion of the theory of one principle with different manifestations. Accordingly, for divine beings (神明) and numinous emptiness (虛靈), he defined divine beings as Body of Li, numinous emptiness as Use of Li, and Myeongdeok as Li (理). Like this, the viewpoint to combine mind and nature with each other and consider Myeongdeok as Li deepened Nosa's theories of human nature and mind and i and ki.the Deepening Process of the Theory of Li (主理論) represses self- interest, restores courtesy, and has the significance of administration theory that emphasizes human order. For this reason, Jeong Jae-gyu and his literary men strongly developed the movement for protecting the orthodox and repelling the heterodox with the spirit of defending great enlightenment desperately (守死善道)"

The principal provided legal knowledge for designing the curriculum. In the curriculum implementation, the principal tried to settle the importance of the class into the culture. In order to improve the quality of the teaching and learning, the principal has set up a consulting service and has established NSLB and diploma system. In order to evaluate the curriculum, the principal conducted questionnaires, interviewed department heads, and operated the TRF to investigate the problems and remedies of the school curriculum. Finally, the principal created a department responsible for the school curriculum and an operating system centered on the curriculum. The principals operated GAT, TRF, supervision and in-service training in order to raise job maturity and psychological maturity.  Based on this, a recommendation for future research is as follows. Due to the context of the new school, the principal was able to actively participate in the process of developing the school curriculum, and after that, it was possible to manage the entire school curriculum under the supervision of the principal. This suggests that it is limited to the heads of general schools, which are difficult to participate from the development stage of the school curriculum. In the future study, we hope that research will be conducted to reveal the best practices of the principal’s school curriculum management in high schools."
