Flood Hazard Rating Prediction for Urban Areas Using Random Forest and LSTM,2020,"['Urban flooding', 'Observed rainfall', 'Hazard rating', 'Machine learning', 'Flood prediction', 'Random forest']",,"A flood hazard rating prediction model was developed that is based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network and random forest. The target area was Samseong District in Seoul, which has a history of severe flooding. The Storm Water Management Model was used to generate training data for the LSTM model to predict the total overflow as the rainfall input data. Two-dimensional numerical analysis was performed to calculate inundation and flow velocity maps for training the random forest, which was used to generate a map of the predicted flood hazard rating of grid units given the total accumulative overflow of the target area. To confirm the goodness of fit, the proposed model was used to predict a flood hazard rating map for a rainfall event observed on July 27, 2011. The prediction accuracy for the flood hazard rating of each grid was 99.86% when the debris factor was considered and 99.99% when the debris factor was not considered."

Random forest ensemble using a weight-adjusted voting algorithm,2020,"['classification', 'ensemble', 'random forest', 'voting', 'wave']",,"A classification ensemble is a learning method that aggregates different classifiers to obtain more accurate class predictions. Among many developed methods, Random Forest is known as one of the most accurate ensemble methods. It combines many randomized decision trees using simple majority voting scheme. Wave, a weighted voting algorithm, has proven to outperform simple majority voting when combined with bagging. In this paper, we investigated whether random forest using the wave voting scheme can further improve classification accuracy. Experiments show that the larger the ensemble size, the more accurate it is than other methods including single tree, bagging, AdaBoost, random forest (simple majority voting). The result also shows that random forest with wave is more accurate than bagging with wave when the ensemble size is large enough."
Correlation Analysis of Airline Customer Satisfaction using Random Forest with Deep Neural Network and Support Vector Machine Model,2020,"['Random Forest', 'Support Vector Machine', 'SVM', 'Deep Neural Network', 'DNN', 'Correlation Analysis', 'Airline Customer Satisfaction', 'Kaggle']",,"There are many airline customer evaluation data, but they are insufficient in terms of predicting customer satisfaction in practice. In particular, they are generally insufficient in case of verification of data value and development of a customer satisfaction prediction model based on customer evaluation data. In this paper, airline customer satisfaction analysis is conducted through an experiment of correlation analysis between customer evaluation data provided by Google's Kaggle. The difference in accuracy varied according to the three types, which are the overall variables, the top 4 and top 8 variables with the highest correlation. To build an airline customer satisfaction prediction model, they are applied to three classification algorithms of Random Forest, SVM, DNN and conduct a classification experiment. They are divided into training data and verification data by 7:3. As a result, the DNN model showed the lowest accuracy at 86.4%, while the SVM model at 89% and the Random Forest model at 95.7% showed the highest accuracy and performance."

The measured MT data were severely distorted by electrical noise caused by subways, power lines, factories, houses, and farmlands, and by vehicle noise from passing trains and large trucks. Using machine-learning methods, we classified the MT time series data obtained near the railway and highway into two groups according to the inclusion of traffic noise. We applied three schemes, stochastic gradient descent, support vector machine, and random forest, to the time series data for the highspeed train noise. We formulated three datasets, Hx, Hy, and Hx & Hy, for the time series data of the large truck noise and applied the random forest method to each dataset. To evaluate the effect of removing the traffic noise, we compared the time series data, amplitude spectra, and apparent resistivity curves before and after removing the traffic noise from the time series data. We also examined the frequency range affected by traffic noise and whether artifact noise occurred during the traffic noise removal process as a result of the residual difference."
A Simple Rule for Monitoring the Error Rate of Random Forest for Classification,2020,"['Random forest', 'Margin of victory', 'Convergence diagnostic', 'Out-of-bag error']",,"Statistics are proposed to assist in choosing the number of trees in random forests for classification, one of which is very useful in monitoring of the out-of-bag (OOB) error rate. These statistics are used sequentially as the forest is constructed and are computed from OOB votes or test set votes. They provide a measure of the expected disagreement between the current forest and the limiting forest with infinitely many trees. Examples and simulation studies of the statistic for monitoring of the OOB error rate are provided to illustrate the performance of these statistics."

Through this, we studied the diabetes-related relationship between BMI, triglyceride, and cholesterol as well as blood sugar, a factor that diabetic patients should pay much attention to."
Ransomware Detection using Random Forest Technique,2020,['Ransomware detectionMachine learningRandom forestCyber security'],,"Nowadays, the ransomware became a serious threat challenge the computing world that requires an immediate consideration to avoid financial and moral blackmail. So, there is a real need for a new method that can detect and stop this type of attack. Most of the previous detection methods followed a dynamic analysis technique which involves a complicated process. The present study proposes a novel method based on static analysis to detect ransomware. The significant characteristic of proposed method is dispensing of disassemble process by direct extraction of features from raw byte with the use of frequent pattern mining which remarkably increases the detection speed. The Gain Ratio technique was used for feature selection which exhibited that 1000 features was the optimal number for detection process. The current study involved using random forest classifier with a comprehensive analysis to the effect of both tree and seed numbers on the ransomware detection. The results showed that tree numbers of 100 with seed number of 1 achieved best results in terms of time-consuming and accuracy. The experimental evaluation revealed that the proposed method could achieve a high accuracy of 97.74% for detection ransomware."
Assessment of Carbon Sequestration Potential in Degraded and Non-Degraded Community Forests in Terai Region of Nepal,2020,"['biomass', 'carbon', 'carbon pools', 'climate change', 'community forest']",,"This study was carried out in degraded and non-degraded community forests (CF) in the Terai region of Kanchanpur district, Nepal. A total of 63 concentric sample plots each of 500 m2 was laid in the inventory for estimating above and below-ground biomass of forests by using systematic random sampling with a sampling intensity of 0.5%. Mallotus philippinensis and Shorea robusta were the most dominant species in degraded and non-degraded CF accounting Importance Value Index (I.V.I) of 97.16 and 178.49, respectively. Above-ground tree biomass carbon in degraded and non-degraded community forests was 74.64±16.34 t ha-1 and 163.12±20.23 t ha-1, respectively. Soil carbon sequestration in degraded and non-degraded community forests was 42.55±3.10 t ha-1 and 54.21±3.59 t ha-1, respectively. Hence, the estimated total carbon stock was 152.68±22.95 t ha-1 and 301.08±27.07 t ha-1 in degraded and non-degraded community forests, respectively. It was found that the carbon sequestration in the non-degraded community forest was 1.97 times higher than in the degraded community forest. CO2 equivalent in degraded and non-degraded community forests was 553 t ha-1 and 1105 t ha-1, respectively. Statistical analysis showed a significant difference between degraded and non-degraded community forests in terms of its total biomass and carbon sequestration potential (p＜0.05). Studies indicate that the community forest has huge potential and can reward economic benefits from carbon trading to benefit from the REDD+/CDM mechanism by promoting the sustainable conservation of community forests."
"Estimation of Carbon Stock in the Chir Pine (Pinus roxburghii Sarg.) Plantation Forest of Kathmandu Valley, Central Nepal",2020,"['climate change', 'CO2 stock', 'community forest', 'd-d curve', 'regeneration']",,"Vegetation carbon sequestration and regeneration are the two major parameters of forest research. In this study, we analyzed the vegetation carbon stock and regeneration of community-managed pine plantation of Kathmandu, central Nepal. Vegetation data were collected from 40 circular plots of 10 m radius (for the tree) and 1m radius (for seedling) applying a stratified random sampling and nested quadrat method. The carbon stock was estimated by Chave allometric model and estimated carbon stock was converted into CO2 equivalents. Density-diameter (d-d) curve was also prepared to check the regeneration status and stability of the plantation. A d-d curve indicates the good regeneration status of the forest with a stable population in each size class. Diversity of trees was very low, only two tree species Pinus roxburghii and Eucalyptus citriodora occurred in the sample plots. Pine was the dominant tree in terms of density, basal area, biomass, carbon stock and CO2 stock than the eucalyptus. The basal area, carbon stock and CO2 stock of forest was 33±1.0 m2 ha-1, 108±5.0 Mg ha-1 and 394±18 Mg ha-1, respectively. Seedling and tree density of the plantation was 4,965 ha-1 and 339 ha-1 respectively. The forest carbon stock showed a positive relationship with biomass, tree diameter, height and basal area but no relationship with tree density. Canopy cover and tree diameter have a negative effect on seedling density and regeneration. In conclusion, the community forest has a stable population in each size class, sequestering a significant amount of carbon and CO2 emitted from densely populated Kathmandu metro city as the forest biomass hence have a potentiality to mitigate the global climate change."

Acacia Dominated Area Exclosures Enhance the Carbon Sequestration Potential of Degraded Dryland Forest Ecosystems,2020,"['area exclosure', 'biomass', 'carbon sequestration', 'vegetation', 'northern Ethiopia']",,"Area exclosure is a widely practiced intervention of restoring degraded lands though its impact in sequestering terrestrial and soil carbon is scanty. The study was initiated to investigate the effect of exclosure of different ages on carbon sequestration potential of restoring degraded dryland ecosystems in eastern Tigray, northern Ethiopia. Twelve plots each divided into three layers were randomly selected from 5, 10 and 15 years old exclosures and paired adjacent open grazing land. Tree and shrub biomasses were determined using destructive sampling while herb layer biomass was determined using total harvest. The average total biomass obtained were 13.6, 24.8, 27.1, and 55.5 Mg ha-1 for open grazing, 5 years, 10 years, and 15 years exclosures respectively. The carbon content of plant species ranged between 48 to 53 percent of a dry biomass. The total carbon stored in the 5 years, 10 years and 15 years age exclosures were 39 Mg C ha-1, 46.3 Mg C ha-1, and 64.6 Mg C ha-1 respectively while in the open grazing land the value was 24.7 Mg C ha-1. Carbon stock is age dependent and increases with age. The difference in total carbon content between exclosures and open grazing land varied between 14.3-40 Mg C ha-1. Although it is difficult to extrapolate this result for a longer future, the average annual carbon being sequestered in the oldest exclosure was about 2.7 Mg C ha-1 yr-1. In view of improving degraded area and sequestering carbon, area exclosures are promising options."

Selection of dipterocarp species for enrichment planting in a secondary tropical rainforest,2020,"['Dipterocarp', 'growth', 'survival rate', 'species trial']",,"The selection of species for enrichment planting that involves native species in a secondary lowland dipterocarps forest as one of the tropical rainforest types should be conducted to maintain the sustainable management of tropical rainforests. The research of species trial of dipterocarp species was planted under a randomized complete block design with four repli�cations. The following parameters were examined: survival rate, diameter breast height (DBH), pilodyn penetration (PP), and stress wave velocity (SWV). The survival rate (F ¼ 1.72; p ¼ 0.047), DBH (F ¼ 6.67, p < 0.0001), and pilodyn penetration (F ¼ 14.19; p < 0.001) signifi�cantly differed at 12.5 years after planting. The survival rate of Shorea leprosula was the high�est (85%) of all the species, and the survival rate of other species, namely, S. macrophylla, S.ovalis, S. johorensis, S. scaberima, and S. parvifolia, was more than 70%. The best growth of DBH parameter was observed in S. platyclados. The DBH growth of S. platyclados 12.5 years after planting were 27.62 cm (mean annual diameter increment [MADI]¼ 2.2 cm/year).The species whose growth in DBH was similar to those of S. platyclados were S. leprosula, S.parvivolia, and S. ovalis. However, stress wave velocity (SWV) was not significantly different among dipterocarp species (F ¼ 1.26; p ¼ 0.234). Pilodyn penetration (PP) was significantly correlated with DBH (Pearson’s correlations ¼ 0.306; p < 0.001), whereas stress wave velocity was not significantly correlated with DBH and PP (p > 0.05), and their Pearson’s correlations were 0.043 and 0.012, respectively. These results suggested that each dipterocarp species varied in terms of their growth and wood properties. Thus, choosing the species for enrich�ment planting in secondary tropical rainforests depends on the characteristics of each spe�cies and the desired final product of forest management."
"Productivity of highland bamboo (Yushania alpina) across different plantation niches in West Amhara, Ethiopia",2020,"['Biomass', 'culm', 'density', 'plantation niche']",,"Highland bamboo as part of Agroforestry practice is planted and managed by farmers in various plantation niches. However, the planation niches which are types of management on the productivity of bamboo is not yet understood. The research evaluates the impact of plantation niches on the productivity of highland bamboo in potential bamboo growing areas of West Amhara, Ethiopia. Farta, Banja, Dega Damot, and Sinan districts were selected for the study to represent potential highland bamboo growing areas in West Amhara. In each district, three kebeles (smaller administrative units in Ethiopia) were also selected based on their resource status and prevalence growing niches. Finally, a total of 324 sample plots were randomly selected over study areas for data collection. The Productivity and basal area of the bamboo stand were estimated by using DBH of the culm. Whereas the volume of bamboo stands was estimated using DBH, the height of culm breast, and total culm size. The diameter distribution of bamboo culms along plantation niches shows positively skewed between 4 and 8 cm ranges. The standing stock of culm ranges from 19,188 ± 336 culms ha1 to 23,129 ± 390 culms ha1 in woodlot and riverbank niches, respectively. The biomass storage capacity of highland bamboo varies from 92.2 ± 4.2 ton ha1 to 118.6 ± 4.2 ton ha1 total dry weight (TDW) from the roadside to riverbank plantation niches. Generally bamboo has a higher potential of accumulating huge dry weight, which is a good indicator of its potential for carbon sequestration and environmental protection. Therefore, it needs great attention from respective stakeholders to get twin benefits of bamboo as production and climate change mitigation."

This study was carried out to determine key statistical characteristics of rainfall affecting the occurrences of flooding by using observed rainfall, one- and two-dimensional hydraulic analysis models, and random forests. The target area selected was the Centum City area of Busan, where flooding occurs frequently with heavy rainfall. For analysis, the rainfall data from the Automatic Weather System (AWS) and radar observatory in the entire city of Busan were collected. Using the results from the one- and two-dimensional numerical models, the occurrence of flooding was determined according to the observed rainfall events. The random forest was used to classify the presence or absence of flooding according to the statistical characteristics of rainfall, and the importance evaluation function was applied to determine the impact of each statistical factor. The three main statistical factors of rainfall with the greatest impact on the occurrence of flooding were analyzed as the 1-hr maximum rainfall, the average rainfall, and the skewness. On the other hand, the three main factors affecting the maximum flood depth were the 3-hrs maximum rainfall, the 1-hr maximum rainfall, and the total rainfall. It is judged that the results of this study will be useful in suggesting quantitative urban flood forecasting standards when rainfall is examined in real-time by using various observation equipment."

Using random forests, artificial neural networks, and support vector machines method, we estimate office market rent determinant model based on 507 office rental information data in Seoul. We attempt to identify the best performed model and also adopt the Partial Dependence(PD) Plots to examine the relative impact of research variables on predicted value. We classify the sample data into Class A, Class B, Class C, and the below Class C group. We apply the same method for each of those group. In general, we find that the support vector machines model performs best followed by random forests model and artificial neural networks model. The results indicate that the rent has a positive relation with rentable/usable ratio, floor, building age, and number of elevator.

Nonetheless, due to the several defects, such as restricted analytic models, limited variables of dataset, and endogeneity problems caused by the omitted variable bias, the findings of prior studies has not been consistent. Considering those limitations, this study proposed the application of Random Forests(RF), one of the representative methods of machine learning, and investigated the factors to predict each individual’s private tutoring expenditure using the 2nd year dataset of the Korea Education and Employment Panel Ⅱ. Furthermore, this study attempted to find more desirable model in predicting individual student’s private tutoring expenditure based on the comparison among OLS, Fixed Effect Model, and Random Effect Model. This study found that the following variable affected the expenditure for private tutoring: male parent’s monthly income, number of book to read in a month, the degree of satisfaction on creative experience activities & career education, and month expenditure on after-school classes for advancement, etc. Also this study identified that the school random effect model was the most appropriate in predicting each individual student’s private tutoring expenditure. Based on these results, this study provided useful policy implications for reducing demands for private tutoring and suggestions for future research regarding more rigorous methods for predicting variable related to private tutoring expenditure."

In the pre-processing step, 10 bands and 6 vegetation spectral index were generated from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images. In image-classification step is consisted of extracting the vegetation area through 8-class land cover classification and performing the vegetation species classification. The image classification algorithm used Random Forest to evaluate the accuracy and calculate feature importance through Out-Of-Bag(OOB). To identify the advantages of multi- temporary Sentinel-2 for vegetation classification, the overall accuracy was compared according to the number of images stacked and vegetation spectral index. Overall accuracy was 77% when using single-time Sentinel-2 images, but improved to 81% when using multi-time Sentinel-2 images. In addition, the overall accuracy improved to about 83% in learning when the vegetation index was used additionally.

Sentinel 위성영상과 기계학습을 이용한 국내산불 피해강도 탐지,2020,"['machine learning', 'wildfire', 'Wildfire-damaged area', 'Sentinel-1', 'Sentinel-2']","국토 대부분이 산림으로 구성되어 있는 대한민국은 매 년 많은 산불이 발생한다. 산불은 토양의 전단강도를 약화시켜 산사태에 취약한 토양층을 만들기도 하고, 수목의 복구가능여부에 따라 다른 계획 설립이 필요하기 때문에 산불피해면적 뿐만 아니라 피해강도에 대한 파악도 중요하다. 위성 원격탐사를 통한 산불피해강도 추정 연구가 많이 수행되어 왔으나, NDVI(Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)와 NBR(Normalized Burn Ratio) 등과 같은 단일 인자의 시계열 변화만을 이용하여 피해강도를 파악하기에는 한계가 있다. 본 연구에서는 Sentinel-1A SAR-C (Synthetic Aperture Radar-C)와 Sentinel-2A MSI(Multi Spectral Instrument)센서의 자료를 이용하여 기계학습방법을 통한 산불 피해강도 탐지 모델들을 제시하였다. 2017년 5월 삼척, 2019년 4월 강릉·동해, 2019년 4월 고성·속초 총 세개의 산불사례를 이용하여 RF(Random forest), LR(Logistic regression), SVM(Support Vector Machine)기계학습 모델을 구축하였다. 연구결과, random forest 모델이 82.3%의 총정확도로 가장 높은 성능을 보여주었다. 모델의 범용성 및 학습자료 민감도 확인을 위해 사례교차검증도 추가 시행하였는데, 그 결과 사례들의 시기적 차이에 의한 식생활력 및 재생도의 차이에 민감도가 높음을 확인하였다. 이는 추후 다양한 시공간적 사례를 추가할 시 개선이 될 것으로 보인다.","In South Korea with forest as a major land cover class (over 60% of the country), many wildfires occur every year. Wildfires weaken the shear strength of the soil, forming a layer of soil that is vulnerable to landslides. It is important to identify the severity of a wildfire as well as the burned area to sustainably manage the forest. Although satellite remote sensing has been widely used to map wildfire severity, it is often difficult to determine the severity using only the temporal change of satellite-derived indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR).In this study, we proposed an approach for determining wildfire severity based on machine learning through the synergistic use of Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar-C data and Sentinel-2A Multi Spectral Instrument data. Three wildfire cases–Samcheok in May 2017, Gangreung·Donghae in April 2019, and Gosung·Sokcho in April 2019–were used for developing wildfire severity mapping models with three machine learning algorithms (i.e., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine). The results showed that the random forest model yielded the best performance, resulting in an overall accuracy of 82.3%. The cross-site validation to examine the spatiotemporal transferability of the machine learning models showed that the models were highly sensitive to temporal differences between the training and validation sites, especially in the early growing season. This implies that a more robust model with high spatiotemporal transferability can be developed when more wildfire cases with different seasons and areas are added in the future."

The traditional approach for this was to construct a mathematical model that considers the characteristics of infectious diseases, so prior knowledge about their characteristics is required. Recently, machine learning-based approach based on relevant data such as weather and past occurrences has drawn much attention. Although this approach is free from the limitation of the traditional approach, the input variables should be selected so that good prediction performance can be achieved. However, the importance of each input changes depending on when the prediction point is. In this paper, we propose a random forest-based prediction model for analyzing the change of variable importances according to the prediction point. To do this, we first collect and pre-process relevant data for the analysis. Then, we train a random forest and obtain the variable importances while changing the prediction point. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted various experiments for domestic infectious diseases and classified them into three clusters. Then, we extracted features from each cluster, such as important input variables and major changes."

This study explores the main drivers of satisfaction with PT and their interactions by training the PT satisfaction forest. The results of the random forest in-depth analysis show PT passengers see the service attributes service frequency, departure time accuracy, safety at stops, vehicle cleanliness, seating capacity, and information provision before the journey as the most important followed by ticket seller behavior, time table information provision, driver behavior, and ticket price. Hence the policies aimed at achieving these attributes could potentially improve the PT satisfaction. Furthermore, the results of the PT service attributes interaction analysis showed the fact that there is no strong interaction between satisfaction with different PT service attributes. This suggests treating them individually in models rather than considering their interactions as well. Furthermore, a multiple linear regression PT satisfaction model has been developed and validated in the current study that could be used as a policy tool in PT decision making."

In order to estimate the non-use value of the heterogeneous green space of Seoul—namely, the Han River, the urban forest, and Bukhansan Mountain—we acquired the actual transaction price for apartments—the main housing type in Seoul—and conducted a hedonic price analysis. Due to the nature of collective buildings, there were a number of transaction records with the same location information and the same housing characteristics. This resulted in a spatial autocorrelation in the transaction price and a hierarchical structure in the explanatory variables. To manage them, spatial lag variables, data grouping by the same housing characteristics, and the application of the hierarchical linear model were considered. Among these models, the spatial autocorrelation in the regression residuals decreased significantly when a two-level random intercept linear model was applied to the grouped transaction data. In case of estimation of the hedonic housing price model using the transaction data of collective housing in Korea, the method presented above is might be worth considering as an alternative if spatial econometric models cannot be directly applicable due to the large number of transactions. The results show that housing prices in Seoul are positively associated with views of Bukhansan Mountain, but not with other urban forests. For the Han River, relatively large view values were measured compared to those of other urban green spaces."

This has led to continuous reports of cases of forest damage due to physiological stress, not pest damage. In 2014, pine trees were collectively damaged in the forest genetic resources reserve of Sogwang-ri, Uljin, South Korea. An investigation was launched to determine the causes of the dieback, so that a forest management plan could be prepared to deal with the current dieback, and to prevent future damage. This study aimedto 1) understand the topographic and structural characteristics of the area which experienced pine tree dieback, 2) identify the main causes of the dieback, and 3) predict future risk areas through the use of machine-learning techniques. A model for identifying risk areas was developed using 14 explanatory variables, including location, elevation, slope, and age class. When three machine-learning techniques-Decision Tree, Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were applied to the model, RF and SVM showed higher predictability scores, with accuracies over 93%. Our analysis of the variable set showed that the topographical areas most vulnerable to pine dieback were those with high altitudes, high daily solar radiation, and limited water availability. We also found that, when it came to forest stand characteristics, pine trees with high vertical stand densities (5-15 m high) and higher age classes experienced a higher risk of dieback. The RF and SVM models predicted that 9.5% or 115 ha of the Geumgang Pine Forest are at high risk for pine dieback. Our study suggests the need for further investigation into the vulnerable areas of the Geumgang Pine Forest, and also for climate change adaptive forest management steps to protect those areas which remain undamaged."

The developed Random Forest model could predict the cooling load and illuminance with appropriate accuracy (CVRMSE of 1.55% and 3.58%, respectively) compared to the ground truth from the IDA ICE simulation. The optimal shape of the shading device is determined among several alternatives using the TOPSIS method that is one of the multi-criteria decision making methods. In this process, two objectives (cooling load and illuminance) could have different weights to reflect the priority or preference of decisionmakers. As a result, the optimal shape of the dynamic shading device derived from the multi-objective optimization process could provided improved performances both on cooling load and visual comfort. Besides, our process was able to consider different weights of each objective depending on the decision makers’ preferences."

And the subjects of this study were the 6,630 students in the 168 schools who participated in PISA 2018 and the 286 variables of student, parents, teacher, and school were used for analysis. As a result, the variables of student were found to play a major role in classifying students into the general group rather than the below basic literacy level group. Specifically, the group classification was influenced by the variables related to the various reading strategies, the experiences, frequency and cognition of reading activities, and the difficulty or effort of the PISA testing or survey. Also, other variables related to individual and family backgrounds affected the classification of groups. In addition, by using the random forest, this research confirmed the nonlinear relationship between group classification and affecting variables, taking into account complex relationships among variables.

The data used in the analysis totaled 10,545 rows, consisting of 160 columns including 38 in the statement of financial position, 26 in the statement of comprehensive income, 11 in the statement of cash flows, and 76 in the index of financial ratios. Unlike most previous prior studies used the default event as the basis for learning about default risk, this study calculated default risk using the market capitalization and stock price volatility of each company based on the Merton model. Through this, it was able to solve the problem of data imbalance due to the scarcity of default events, which had been pointed out as the limitation of the existing methodology, and the problem of reflecting the difference in default risk that exists within ordinary companies. Because learning was conducted only by using corporate information available to unlisted companies, default risks of unlisted companies without stock price information can be appropriately derived. Through this, it can provide stable default risk assessment services to unlisted companies that are difficult to determine proper default risk with traditional credit rating models such as small and medium-sized companies and startups. Although there has been an active study of predicting corporate default risks using machine learning recently, model bias issues exist because most studies are making predictions based on a single model. Stable and reliable valuation methodology is required for the calculation of default risk, given that the entitys default risk information is very widely utilized in the market and the sensitivity to the difference in default risk is high. Also, Strict standards are also required for methods of calculation. The credit rating method stipulated by the Financial Services Commission in the Financial Investment Regulations calls for the preparation of evaluation methods, including verification of the adequacy of evaluation methods, in consideration of past statistical data and experiences on credit ratings and changes in future market conditions. This study allowed the reduction of individual models bias by utilizing stacking ensemble techniques that synthesize various machine learning models. This allows us to capture complex nonlinear relationships between default risk and various corporate information and maximize the advantages of machine learning-based default risk prediction models that take less time to calculate. To calculate forecasts by sub model to be used as input data for the Stacking Ensemble model, training data were divided into seven pieces, and sub-models were trained in a divided set to produce forecasts. To compare the predictive power of the Stacking Ensemble model, Random Forest, MLP, and CNN models were trained with full training data, then the predictive power of each model was verified on the test set. The analysis showed that the Stacking Ensemble model exceeded the predictive power of the Random Forest model, which had the best performance on a single model. Next, to check for statistically significant differences between the Stacking Ensemble model and the forecasts for each individual model, the Pair between the Stacking Ensemble model and each individual model was constructed. Because the results of the Shapiro-wilk normality test also showed that all Pair did not follow normality, Using the nonparametric method wilcoxon rank sum test, we checked whether the two model forecasts that make up the Pair showed statistically significant differences. The analysis showed that the forecasts of the Staging Ensemble model showed statistically significant differences from those of the MLP model and CNN model.

We adopt four models (generalized linear model, generalized additive model, random forest (RF), and artificial neural network) for projection based on 630 presence and 600 pseudo-absence data points. The RF model yielded the highest performance. The presence probability of M. capillaris was highest within an annual temperature range of 12 to 24℃ and with precipitation from 800 to 1,300 mm. The occurrence of M. capillaris was positively associated with the precipitation of the driest quarter. The projection map showed that suitable areas for M. capillaris are mainly concentrated in the southern coastal regions of South Korea, where temperatures and precipitation are higher than in other regions, especially in the winter season. We can conclude that M. capillaris is not considered to be invasive based on a habitat suitability map. However, there is a possibility that rising temperatures and increasing precipitation levels in winter can accelerate the expansion of this plant on the Korean Peninsula."

Subsequent epidemiological analyses suggested contaminated feed was the most likely transmission pathway. The primary objective of this study was to describe general biosecurity and management practices implemented in PEDV-positive sow herds and matched control herds at the time the virus emerged. The secondary objective was to determine if any of these general biosecurity and farm management practices were important in explaining PEDV infection status from January 22, 2014 to March 1, 2014. A case herd was defined as a swine herd with clinical signs and a positive test result for PEDV. A questionnaire was used to a gather 30-day history of herd management practices, animal movements on/off site, feed management practices, semen deliveries and biosecurity practices for case (n = 8) and control (n = 12) herds, primarily located in Ontario. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and random forests (RFs). Case herds were larger in size than control herds. Case herds had more animal movements and non-staff movements onto the site. Also, case herds had higher quantities of pigs delivered, feed deliveries and semen deliveries on-site. The biosecurity practices of case herds were considered more rigorous based on herd management, feed deliveries, transportation and truck driver practices than control herds. The RF model found that the most important variables for predicting herd status were related to herd size and feed management variables. Nonetheless, predictive accuracy of the final RF model was 72%."

The load forecasting is one of the key technologies for the efficient operation of the businesses, so many related studies have been published. However, since loads of individual buildings are more volatile than a large-scale load in general, forecasting individual consumers’ loads is much more challenging and only limited studies have been published. In this paper, we propose a hybrid method to forecast electricity loads of individual buildings in a day-ahead manner. Using DTW similarities in load profiles was calculated focusing on their shapes, and clustering is conducted for pattern recognition. We estimate the pattern for the next day by random forest, and combined historical loads with weather information to forecast the hourly load of the day. For performance evaluation, 1,065 days of building load data were tested. The clustering method in our study provided better quality clusters and the classification model outperformed the benchmark model. Also, the hybrid structure recorded high prediction accuracy compared to a single structure."

In other words, from the point of view of behavioral economics, we define that humans can make biased judgments by relying on the heuristic rather than making decisions by rational and reasonable judgments. From this perspective, the domestic real estate market has continuously developed behavioral economics research to explain the behavior of economic players in the housing market since the early 2000s. From the perspective of behavioral economics, this study attempts to identify the factors of decision-making on housing sales in each group through quantitative economic models through logistic regression analysis and machine learning models such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBost, LightGBM, Gradient Boosting, and MLP. It is also different from prior research in that it has applied a metering economy model and machine learning model to build a more predictable model of decision-making on housing sales. This study established the most predictable MLP model for decision-making on housing sales in each group, and the analysis showed that the loss group did not sell the house as the housing price rose, which can be interpreted as a result of the tendency to avoid selling and retain it even if the housing price is lost."

The highest accuracy was achieved with SVM for December–January combination with Overall Accuracy of 74.36% and a kappa coefficient of 0.6905. SVM algorithm performed the best followed by DT, ANN and RF. It was observed that the accuracy of classification increased with multi-temporal datasets. In SVM and RF the accuracy increased by almost 8% from single to dual date, but no increase in accuracy was observed irrespective of taking three dates. For DT and ANN, the accuracy from single to dual date increased by[10% and by approximately 3% (Marginal) for three dates. The single date ANN achieved very poor results but with an increase in the datasets, good accuracy was attained. This study, therefore, reveals that with single and dual datasets, SVM and RF performs well and with multitemporal datasets, DT and ANN can also achieve good accuracy."
A Novel Network Anomaly Detection Method based on Data Balancing and Recursive Feature Addition,2020,"['Network anomaly detection', 'data balancing', 'recursive feature addition', 'parameters combination optimization', 'random forests']",,"Network anomaly detection system plays an essential role in detecting network anomaly and ensuring network security. Anomaly detection system based machine learning has become an increasingly popular solution. However, due to the unbalance and high-dimension characteristics of network traffic, the existing methods unable to achieve the excellent performance of high accuracy and low false alarm rate. To address this problem, a new network anomaly detection method based on data balancing and recursive feature addition is proposed. Firstly, data balancing algorithm based on improved KNN outlier detection is designed to select part respective data on each category. Combination optimization about parameters of improved KNN outlier detection is implemented by genetic algorithm. Next, recursive feature addition algorithm based on correlation analysis is proposed to select effective features, in which a cross contingency test is utilized to analyze correlation and obtain a features subset with a strong correlation. Then, random forests model is as the classification model to detection anomaly. Finally, the proposed algorithm is evaluated on benchmark datasets KDD Cup 1999 and UNSW_NB15. The result illustrates the proposed strategies enhance accuracy and recall, and decrease the false alarm rate. Compared with other algorithms, this algorithm still achieves significant effects, especially recall in the small category."

The input matrices marked with damage location were produced by ARMCs, and then those matrices were sent to the proposed CNN for training. The trained CNN was employed for damage identification and localization. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by the damage identification and localization of a three-storied frame structure. The performance of the proposed CNN was compared with multilayer perception (MLP), random forest, and support vector machine (SVM). Meanwhile, the prediction results from different sample types were also discussed. Furthermore, parametric study in relation to the number of accelerometers and ARMCs used is conducted.

Long-term exposure to SO2 can result in a negative effect on the human body causing respiratory or cardiovascular disease, which makes the effective and continuous monitoring of SO2 crucial. In South Korea, SO2 monitoring at ground stations has been performed, but this does not provide spatially continuous information of SO2 concentrations. Thus, this research estimated spatially continuous ground-level SO2 concentrations at 1 km resolution over South Korea through the synergistic use of satellite data and numerical models. A stacking ensemble approach, fusing multiple machine learning algorithms at two levels (i.e., base and meta), was adopted for ground-level SO2 estimation using data from January 2015 to April 2019. Random forest and extreme gradient boosting were used as based models and multiple linear regression was adopted for the meta-model. The cross-validation results showed that the metamodel produced the improved performance by 25% compared to the base models, resulting in the correlation coefficient of 0.48 and root-mean-square-error of 0.0032 ppm. In addition, the temporal transferability of the approach was evaluated for one-year data which were not used in the model development. The spatial distribution of ground-level SO2 concentrations based on the proposed model agreed with the general seasonality of SO2 and the temporal patterns of emission sources."

In addition, a random selection of flies on the sticky trap was carried out for molecular identification of a total of 18 flies. A total of 20 collections were performed, and a total of 1,139 flies were observed in the entire trap. Most of the areas where flies were more collected were a pine forest and a meadow. It was confirmed that the temperature were lower in the pine forest than in other regions, and the humidity in the pine forest was maintained at 70-80%. At the beginning of the trap installation, many flies were collected, and the number of flies collected thereafter decreased. After the rain, the number of flies collected briefly increased. The number of flies was estimated to be related to temperature and humidity, and the Mantel test was used to determine their correlation. As a result, it was confirmed that the number of flies varies with temperature. As a result of molecular identification using COI markers to determine which flies mainly came from, they were identified: Chrysomya pinguis, Anthomyia illocata, H y d r o t a e a ig n a v a and H y d r o t a e a le u c o st o m a .

Although the cutter spacing at the minimum specific energy is mainly reflected in the cutter head design, since the optimum cutter spacing at the same cutter penetration depth varies depending on the rock conditions, studies on deciding the optimum cutter spacing should be actively conducted. The machine learning techniques such as the decision tree-based regression model and the SVM regression model were applied to predict the optimum cutter spacing ratio for the nonlinear relationship between cutter penetration depth and cutter spacing. Since the decision tree-based methods are greatly influenced by the number of data, SVM regression predicted optimum cutter spacing ratio according to the penetration depth more accurately and it is judged that the SVM regression will be effectively used to decide the cutter spacing when designing the cutter head if a large amount of data of the optimum cutter spacing ratio according to the penetration depth is accumulated."

We collect data through a field survey from the randomly selected 66 households in the townships of Hmawbi, Taikkyi and Kunyangon of the Yangon Province, Myanmar. The relationship between social capital and household poverty was analyzed using a binary logistic regression and correlation analysis. Results of our case study show that social capital has a significant impact on alleviating the poverty of households in Myanmar. Because community forestry (CF) members are relatively poor, the local level strategy of REDD+ should target CF members to build up their social capital for supporting forest tenures and benefit sharing among marginalized people. The results of this study suggest that forest policy makers should consider CF areas as potential REDD+ sites when it comes to the effectiveness of REDD+ programs."
Practical evaluation of encrypted traffic classification based on a combined method of entropy estimation and neural networks,2020,"['deep neural networks', 'encrypted traffic classification', 'entropy estimation', 'PCA']",,"Encrypted traffic classification plays a vital role in cybersecurity as network traffic encryption becomes prevalent. First, we briefly introduce three traffic encryption mechanisms: IPsec, SSL/TLS, and SRTP. After evaluating the performances of support vector machine, random forest, naïve Bayes, and logistic regression for traffic classification, we propose the combined approach of entropy estimation and artificial neural networks. First, network traffic is classified as encrypted or plaintext with entropy estimation. Encrypted traffic is then further classified using neural networks. We propose using traffic packet's sizes, packet's inter-arrival time, and direction as the neural network's input. Our combined approach was evaluated with the dataset obtained from the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity. Results show an improved precision (from 1 to 7 percentage points), and some application classification metrics improved nearly by 30 percentage points."

To achieve this goal, a landslide inventory map was prepared based on aerial photograph analysis as well as field observations. A total of 550 landslides have been counted in the entire study area. For model analysis and validation, extracted landslides were randomly selected and divided into two groups. The landslide causative factors such as slope, aspect, curvature, topographic wetness index, elevation, forest type, forest crown density, geology, land-use, soil drainage, and soil texture were used in the analysis. Moreover, to identify the correlation between landslides and causative factors, pixels were divided into several classes and frequency ratio was also extracted. A landslide susceptibility map was constructed using a bayesian predictive model (BPM) based on the entire events.In the cross validation process, the landslide susceptibility map as well as observation data were plotted with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve then the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated and tried to extract a success rate curve. The results showed that, the BPM produced 85.8% accuracy. We believed that the model was acceptable for the landslide susceptibility analysis of the study area. In addition, for risk assessment, monetary value (local) and vulnerability scale were added for each social thematic data layers, which were then converted into US dollar considering landslide occurrence time. Moreover, the total number of the study area pixels and predictive landslide affected pixels were considered for making a probability table. Matching with the affected number, 5,000 landslide pixels were assumed to run for final calculation. Based on the result, cropland showed the estimated total risk as US $ 35.4 million and man-made infrastructure risk amounted to US $ 39.3 million."

For this, making curriculums together with young children was implemented for eight months with three teachers of classes for four year old children in the Forest Day Care Center located in K city. As a result, while reconstructing curriculums, teachers began to become disillusioned from fantasies of predicted paths of planned curriculums and they began to go beyond the representations of reconstructed curriculums while listening attentively to young children. Also, through attentive listening, they became aware of encounting with young children that occurs during curriculum implementation and came to implement curriculums in which unpredictable and random events are created. Through this process, teachers felt confusion and anxiety regarding uncertainty and incompleteness but they also felt joy making curriculums together with young children while experiencing curriculums that unfold as pluralistic and complex open systems. Also, they came to understand curriculums as grounds where new experiments and movements are created. It seems that such processes will have a bridging role in allowing teachers to create creative curriculums together with young children in an age that emphasizes the practice of teachers autonomously creating curriculums."

Actually, HVS is extremely sensitive to color degradation and complex texture changes. In this paper, we firstly reveal that many existing full reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) methods can hardly measure the image quality with contrast and masking texture changes. To solve this problem, considering texture masking effect, we proposed a novel FR-IQA method, called Texture and Color Quality Index (TCQI). The proposed method considers both in the masking effect texture and color visual perceptual threshold, which adopts three kinds of features to reflect masking texture, color difference and structural information. Furthermore, random forest (RF) is used to address the drawbacks of existing pooling technologies. Compared with other traditional learning-based tools (support vector regression and neural network), RF can achieve the better prediction performance. Experiments conducted on five large-scale databases demonstrate that our approach is highly consistent with subjective perception, outperforms twelve the state-of-the-art IQA models in terms of prediction accuracy and keeps a moderate computational complexity. The cross database validation also validates our approach achieves the ability to maintain high robustness."

Prognosticating idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) is an important challenge. In our study, a dataset was split into training and test sets and cross-validation was implemented on the training set, thereby determining the hyperparameters for machine learning models with high test accuracy and low bias. The effectiveness of the following five machine learning models for predicting the hearing prognosis in patients with ISSNHL after 1 month of treatment was assessed: adaptive boosting, K-nearest neighbor, multilayer perceptron, random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM).Methods. The medical records of 523 patients with ISSNHL admitted to Korea University Ansan Hospital between January 2010 and October 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. In this study, we analyzed data from 227 patients (recovery, 106; no recovery, 121) after excluding those with missing data. To determine risk factors, statistical hypothesis tests (e.g., the two-sample t-test for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables) were conducted to compare patients who did or did not recover. Variables were selected using an RF model depending on two criteria (mean decreases in the Gini index and accuracy).Results. The SVM model using selected predictors achieved both the highest accuracy (75.36%) and the highest F-score (0.74) on the test set. The RF model with selected variables demonstrated the second-highest accuracy (73.91%) and F-score (0.74). The RF model with the original variables showed the same accuracy (73.91%) as that of the RF model with selected variables, but a lower F-score (0.73). All the tested models, except RF, demonstrated better performance after variable selection based on RF.Conclusion. The SVM model with selected predictors was the best-performing of the tested prediction models. The RF model with selected predictors was the second-best model. Therefore, machine learning models can be used to predict hearing recovery in patients with ISSNHL."

As one such approach, the paper develops a model to predict the likelihood of hospital admission for Medicare and Medicaid insurers in the U.S. The analysis draws from the health insurance claims data of 45,000 patients with 939 features, spanning eight quarters from 2014 and 2015. Six models are adopted to predict patients' hospital admissions in 2016, based on their sociodemographic and health-related characteristics. The paper presents the rationale, processes, and results of analysis from logistic regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, feed-forward Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolution Neural Network, and Recurrent Neural Network. The best performing model, evaluated against recall and precision scores, is the MPL. This simple deep learning model was correct about 80% of the time for patient admissions to hospital. Additionally, tree-based algorithms provide important features related to hospital admission, such as medical risk scores. As a policy implication, the paper discusses predictive risk modeling to provide preventive care for at-risk populations. The paper concludes by suggesting strategies for using the data science approach in the allocation of social welfare programs and services."
Frequency Ratio와 Evidential Belief Function을 활용한 산사태 유발에 대한 환경지리적 민감성 분석과 검증 - 2013년 춘천 산사태를 중심으로 -,2020,"['Landslide', 'Landslide Susceptibility Map', 'Geo-environmental Variables', 'Frequency Ratio', 'Evidential Belief Function', '산사태', '산사태 민감성 지도', '환경지리변수', '빈도비']",,"The objective of this study is to characterize landslide susceptibility depending on various geo-environmental variables as well as to compare the Frequency Ratio (FR) and Evidential Belief Function (EBF) methods for landslide susceptibility analysis of rainfall-induced landslides. In 2013, a total of 259 landslides occurred in Chuncheon, Gangwon Province, South Korea, due to heavy rainfall events with a total cumulative rainfall of 296~721mm in 106~231 hours duration. Landslides data were mapped with better accuracy using the geographic information system (ArcGIS 10.6 version) based on the historic landslide records in Chuncheon from the National Disaster Management System (NDMS), the 2013 landslide investigation report, orthographic images, and aerial photographs. Then the landslides were randomly split into a testing dataset (70%; 181 landslides) and validation dataset (30%; 78 landslides). First, geo-environmental variables were analyzed by using FR and EBF functions for the full data. The most significant factors related to landslides were altitude (100~200m), slope (15~25°), concave plan curvature, high SPI, young timber age, loose timber density, small timber diameter, artificial forests, coniferous forests, soil depth (50~100cm), very well-drained area, sandy loam soil and so on. Second, the landslide susceptibility index was calculated by using selected geo-environmental variables. The model fit and prediction performance were evaluated using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and the Area Under Curve (AUC) methods. The AUC values of both model fit and prediction performance were 80.5% and 76.3% for FR and 76.6% and 74.9% for EBF respectively. However, the landslide susceptibility index, with classes of ‘very high’ and ‘high’, was detected by 73.1% of landslides in the EBF model rather than the FR model (66.7%). Therefore, the EBF can be a promising method for spatial prediction of landslide occurrence, while the FR is still a powerful method for the landslide susceptibility mapping."

Landslide susceptibility maps can provide a probability of landslide prone areas to mitigate or proper control this problems and to take any development plan and disaster management. A landslide inventory map of the study area was prepared based on past historical information and aerial photography analysis. A total of 550 landslides have been counted at the whole study area. The extracted landslides were randomly selected and divided into two different groups, 50% of the landslides were used for model calibration and the other were used for validation purpose. Eleven causative factors (continuous and thematic) such as slope, aspect, curvature, topographic wetness index, elevation, forest type, forest crown density, geology, land-use, soil drainage, and soil texture were used in hazard analysis. The correlation between landslides and these factors, pixels were divided into several classes and frequency ratio was also extracted. Eventually, a landslide susceptibility map was constructed using a logistic regression model based on entire events. Moreover, the landslide susceptibility map was plotted with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calculated the area under the curve (AUC) and tried to extract a success rate curve. Based on the results, logistic regression produced an 85.18% accuracy, so we believed that the model was reliable and acceptable for the landslide susceptibility analysis on the study area. In addition, for risk assessment, vulnerability scale were added for social thematic data layer. The study area predictive landslide affected pixels 2,000 and 5,000 were also calculated for making a probability table. In final calculation, the 2,000 predictive landslide affected pixels were assumed to run. The total population causalities were estimated as 7.75 person that was relatively close to the actual number published in Korean Annual Disaster Report, 2006."

Researchers have proposed numerous classification schemes of these motor imagery to incorporate it with various neurorehabilitation, neuroprosthetics and gaming applications. However, the existing classification schemes face the performance degradation caused by motor-imagery EEG signals with low signal to noise ratio. The paper’s main objective is to use possible thick data analytics techniques to classify effectively the motor imagery EEG signals. Our attempt start with notable classifiers including Decision Trees, Extra Trees, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and SVM and move later to enhance classifications using variety of ensemble learning techniques including Bagging, Adaboost and Stacking. More techniques has been applied on the results of the ensemble learring to eliminate classification noise and supply more relevant features such as substituting outliers with mean value and exercising band-pass filter and Common Spatial Pattern (CSP). The thick data methods has been validated on a public dataset rendered by BCI competition II dataset III and was found to produce better classification performance metric which included performance metric parameters like accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision and recall when confronted with the existing work, thus projecting the usefulness of motor imagery BCI.

Prediction of Chronic Disease-Related Inpatient Prolonged Length of Stay Using Machine Learning Algorithms,2020,"['Length of Stay', 'Chronic Disease', 'Inpatients', 'Machine Learning', 'Discharge Planning']",,"Objectives: The study aimed to develop and compare predictive models based on supervised machine learning algorithms for predicting the prolonged length of stay (LOS) of hospitalized patients diagnosed with five different chronic conditions.Methods: An administrative claim dataset (2008–2012) of a regional network of nine hospitals in the Tampa Bay area, Florida, USA, was used to develop the prediction models. Features were extracted from the dataset using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Five learning algorithms, namely, decision tree C5.0, linear support vector machine (LSVM), k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and multi-layered artificial neural networks, were used to build the model with semi-supervised anomaly detection and two feature selection methods. Issues with the unbalanced nature of the dataset were resolved using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). Results:LSVM with wrapper feature selection performed moderately well for all patient cohorts. Using SMOTE to counter data imbalances triggered a tradeoff between the model’s sensitivity and specificity, which can be masked under a similar area under the curve. The proposed aggregate rank selection approach resulted in a balanced performing model compared to other criteria. Finally, factors such as comorbidity conditions, source of admission, and payer types were associated with the increased risk of a prolonged LOS. Conclusions: Prolonged LOS is mostly associated with pre-intraoperative clinical and patient socio-economic factors. Accurate patient identification with the risk of prolonged LOS using the selected model can provide hospitals a better tool for planning early discharge and resource allocation, thus reducing avoidable hospitalization costs."

To date, many studies have made efforts for the prediction of PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations. Unlike previous studies, we conducted the prediction of tomorrow’s PM10 concentration for the Air Korea stations using Chinese PM10 data in addition to the satellite AOD and weather variables. We constructed 230,639 matchups from the raw data over 3 million and built an RF (random forest) model from the matchups to cope with the complexity and nonlinearity. The validation statistics from the blind test showed excellent accuracy with the RMSE (root mean square error) of 9.905 μg/m3 and the CC (correlation coefficient) of 0.918. Moreover, our prediction model showed a stable performance without the dependency on seasons or the degree of PM10 concentration. However, part of coastal areas had a relatively low accuracy, which implies that a dedicated model for coastal areas will be necessary. Additional input variables such as wind direction, precipitation, and air stability should also be incorporated into the prediction model as future work."

PHM is a framework that provides individualized solutions for managing system health. This study predicted the remaining useful life (RUL) of aeroengine using degradation data collected by sensors provided by the IEEE 2008 PHM Conference Challenge. There are 218 engine sensor data that has initial wear and production deviations. It was difficult to determine the characteristics of the engine parts since the system and domain-specific information was not provided. Each engine has a different cycle, making it difficult to use time series models. Therefore, this analysis was performed using machine learning algorithms rather than statistical time series models. The machine learning algorithms used were a random forest, gradient boost tree analysis and XG boost. A sliding window was applied to develop RUL predictions. We compared model performance before and after applying the sliding window, and proposed a data preprocessing method to develop RUL predictions. The model was evaluated by R-square scores and root mean squares error (RMSE). It was shown that the XG boost model of the random split method using the sliding window preprocessing approach has the best predictive performance."
Enhancing the Reliability of Wi-Fi Network Using Evil Twin AP Detection Method Based on Machine Learning,2020,"['Access Point', 'Classification Algorithm', 'Clock Skew', 'Evil Twin AP', 'Rogue AP', 'Wireless Network']",,"Wireless networks have become integral to society as they provide mobility and scalability advantages. However, their disadvantage is that they cannot control the media, which makes them vulnerable to various types of attacks. One example of such attacks is the evil twin access point (AP) attack, in which an authorized AP is impersonated by mimicking its service set identifier (SSID) and media access control (MAC) address. Evil twin APs are a major source of deception in wireless networks, facilitating message forgery and eavesdropping. Hence, it is necessary to detect them rapidly. To this end, numerous methods using clock skew have been proposed for evil twin AP detection. However, clock skew is difficult to calculate precisely because wireless networks are vulnerable to noise. This paper proposes an evil twin AP detection method that uses a multiple-feature-based machine learning classification algorithm.

As a result of the homogeneity test, the innovativeness, risk-taking, initiative, and entrepreneurship education all showed great effects on heterogeneity, and the average effect size was analyzed by random effect model. The average effect size analyzed was 0.38 ~ 0.49, and all four variables showed moderate average effect size. As a result of analyzing the average effect size by forest plot, all showed proper results. From the results of funnel plot analysis of entrepreneurship education, published errors were confirmed asymmetric. Research data on entrepreneurship education shows that it cannot represent the whole. It is a structural equation model with entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial intention as a parameter. Iinnovation and risk-taking have an impact on entrepreneurship by taking entrepreneurship education as a parameter. Initiative had an effect on the entrepreneurial intention a business, regardless of entrepreneurship education. In a number of studies, university entrepreneurship education has had an impact on the entrepreneurial intention. It should be changed to entrepreneurship education that combines theory and practice.

Especially in indoor localization environment, that is one of the most concerningtopic of smart cities, internet of things and wireless sensor networks. Many technologies are being used for localization purposein indoor environment and Wi-Fi using received signal strengths(RSSs) is one of them. Wi-Fi RSSs are sensitive to reflection, refraction, interference and channel noise that cause irregularity insignal strengths. The irregular and anomalous RSS values, used ina Wi-Fi indoor localization environment, cannot define the locationof any unknown node correctly. Therefore, this research has developed an outlier detection technique named as iF_Ensemblefor Wi-Fi indoor localization environment by analyzing RSSs using the combination of supervised, unsupervised and ensemble machine learning methods. In this research isolation forest (iForest)is used as an unsupervised learning method. Supervised learningmethod includes support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and random forest (RF) classifiers with stacking thatis an ensemble learning method. For the evaluation purpose accuracy, precision, recall, F-score and ROC-AUC curve are used. Theevaluation of used machine learning method provides high accuracy of 97.8 percent with proposed outlier detection methods andalmost 2 percent improvement in the accuracy of localization process in indoor environment after eliminating outliers."

Predicting the Outcome of a T20 Cricket Game Based on the Players’ Abilities to Perform Under Pressure,2020,"['Result prediction', 'Classification', 'SVM']",,"With the advent of the Twenty20 format in cricket, the game has become more competitive. The number of nail-biting finishes that go to the last over has also increased as a result. As the game goes to the last over, the match result is mostly dependent on the effectiveness of batsmen at the crease and the player who is bowling the last over. This gave rise to an interesting idea for predicting the game result before the start of the final over based on the capabilities of the batsmen and the bowler. We used data from the first eight Indian Premier League (IPL) seasons as the training data, and from the last two IPL seasons as the test data. We trained and tested our model using Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbors algorithms, and obtained the best accuracy using the SVM (89.36%)."

An assessment of machine learning models for slump flow and examining redundant features,2020,"['multilayer perceptron regression', 'regression trees', 'support vector regression', 'redundant features', 'M5P trees']",,"Over the years, several machine learning approaches have been proposed and utilized to create a prediction model for the high-performance concrete (HPC) slump flow. Despite HPC is a highly complex material, predicting its pattern is a rather ambitious process. Hence, choosing and applying the correct method remain a crucial task. Like some other problems, prediction of HPC slump flow suffers from abnormal attributes which might both have an influence on prediction accuracy and increases variance. In recent years, different studies are proposed to optimize the prediction accuracy for HPC slump flow.However, more state-of-the-art regression algorithms can be implemented to create a better model. This study focuses on several methods with different mathematical backgrounds to get the best possible results. Four well-known algorithms Support Vector Regression, M5P Trees, Random Forest, and MLPReg are implemented with optimum parameters as base learners. Also, redundant features are examined to better understand both how ingredients influence on prediction models and whether possible to achieve acceptable results with a few components. Based on the findings, the MLPReg algorithm with optimum parameters gives better results than others in terms of commonly used statistical error evaluation metrics. Besides, chosen algorithms can give rather accurate results using just a few attributes of a slump flow dataset."

The focal uptake in the thyroid gland was drawn in 3D with 40% SUVmax threshold. Features were extracted from volume of interest (VOI) using the LIFEx package. The features obtained were compared in benign and malignant groups, and statistically significant variables were evaluated by receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis. The correlation between the variables with area under curve (AUC) value over 0.7 was examined; variables with correlation coefficient less than 0.6 were evaluated with machine learning algorithms.Results Sixty patients (70% train set, 30% test set) were included in the study. In univariate analysis, a statistically significant difference was observed in 6 conventional parameters, 5 first-, and 16 second-order features between benign and malignant groups in train set (p < 0.05). The feature with the highest benign-malignant discriminating power was GLRLMRLNU (AUC:0.827). AUC value of SUVmax was calculated as 0.758. GLRLMRLNU and SUVmax were evaluated to build a model to predict the exact pathology outcome. Random forest algorithm showed the best accuracy and AUC (78.6% and 0.849, respectively).Conclusion In the differentiation of benign-malignant thyroid incidentalomas, GLRLMRLNU and SUVmax combination may be more useful than SUVmax to predict the outcome."
Heart-Rate-Based Machine-Learning Algorithms for Screening Orthostatic Hypotension,2020,"['orthostatic hypotension', 'heart rate', 'Valsalva maneuver', 'machine learning']",,"Background and Purpose Many elderly patients are unable to actively stand up by themselves and have contraindications to performing the head-up tilt test (HUTT). We aimed to develop screening algorithms for diagnosing orthostatic hypotension (OH) before performing the HUTT.Methods This study recruited 663 patients with orthostatic intolerance (78 with and 585 without OH, as confirmed by the HUTT) and compared their clinical characteristics. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to investigate potential predictors of an OH diagnosis. Machine-learning algorithms were applied to determine whether the accuracy of OH prediction could be used for screening OH without performing the HUTT.Results Differences between expiration and inspiration (E-I differences), expiration:inspiration ratios (E:I ratios), and Valsalva ratios were smaller in patients with OH than in those without OH. The univariate analysis showed that increased age and baseline systolic blood pressure (BP) as well as decreased E-I difference, E:I ratio, and Valsalva ratio were correlated with OH. In the multivariate analysis, increased baseline systolic BP and decreased Valsalva ratio were found to be independent predictors of OH. Using those variables as input features, the classification accuracies of the support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest methods were 84.4%, 84.4%, and 90.6%, respectively.Conclusions We have identified clinical parameters that are strongly associated with OH.

Delirium is distressing for patients and families, can interfere with the management of symptoms such as pain, and is associated with increased elderly mortality. The purpose of this paper is to generate useful clinical knowledge that can be used to distinguish the outcomes of patients with delirium in long-term care facilities. For this purpose, we extracted the clinical classification knowledge associated with delirium using a local covering rule acquisition approach with the rough lower approximation region. The clinical applicability of the proposed method was verified using data collected from a prospective cohort study. From the results of this study, we found six useful clinical pieces of evidence that the duration of delirium could more than 12 days. Also, we confirmed eight factors such as BMI, Charlson Comorbidity Index, hospitalization path, nutrition deficiency, infection, sleep disturbance, bed scores, and diaper use are important in distinguishing the outcomes of delirium patients. The classification performance of the proposed method was verified by comparison with three benchmarking models, ANN, SVM with RBF kernel, and Random Forest, using a statistical five-fold cross-validation method. The proposed method showed an improved average performance of 0.6% and 2.7% in both accuracy and AUC criteria when compared with the SVM model with the highest classification performance of the three models respectively."
GIS와 기계학습을 이용한 지하수 가능성도 작성 연구 현황,2020,"['Groundwater', 'Machine Learning', 'GIS', 'Literature Review']",,"Water resources which is formed of surface and groundwater, are considered as one of the pivotal natural resources worldwide. Since last century, the rapid population growth as well as accelerated industrialization and explosive urbanization lead to boost demand for groundwater for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. In fact, better management of groundwater can play crucial role in sustainable development; therefore, determining accurate location of groundwater based groundwater potential mapping is indispensable. In recent years, integration of machine learning techniques, Geographical Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) are popular and effective methods employed for groundwater potential mapping. For determining the status of the integrated approach, a systematic review of 94 directly relevant papers were carried out over the six previous years (2015-2020). According to the literature review, the number of studies published annually increased rapidly over time. The total study area spanned 15 countries, and 85.1% of studies focused on Iran, India, China, South Korea, and Iraq. 20 variables were found to be frequently involved in groundwater potential investigations, of which 9 factors are almost always present namely slope, lithology (geology), land use/land cover (LU/LC), drainage/river density, altitude (elevation), topographic wetness index (TWI), distance from river, rainfall, and aspect. The data integration was carried random forest, support vector machine and boost regression tree among the machine learning techniques. Our study shows that for optimal results, groundwater mapping must be used as a tool to complement field work, rather than a low-cost substitute. Consequently, more study should be conducted to enhance the generalization and precision of groundwater potential map."

In addition, this study investigated the possibility of systematic exploration of the reaction of the public with the assessment of a model for predicting the classification of YouTube channels, using machine learning. As a result of the study, “One-Minute Science” had a higher average in YouTube Indices, such as the number of views, the number of likes, the number of dislikes, and the number of comments than “Science Cookie.” However, as a result of trend line analysis in which the number of views led to the number of likes, “Science Cookie” had higher levels than “One-Minute Science.” In addition, the topics of videos in which the public showed interests through the number of likes were topics related to space and quantum mechanics. As for the change of comments analyzed since the opening of the channels, when the videos with the above two topics drew attention or were uploaded, there was a noticeable change. As a result of analysis of the model for predicting the classification of YouTube channels, using machine learning, the sigmoid kernel function of SVM was the model with the best performance, showing the accuracy of 90.06%. In addition, it turned out that the random forest model and logistic regression analysis had a high accuracy of 89.96% and 88.20%, respectively. The accuracy of the decision tree model and KNN analysis was somewhat lower than the previous models; however, the performance of the artificial neural network model did not improve, in spite of active functions in various combinations and the change of the number of hidden nodes. Based on the results of this study, big data analysis and machine learning should be used to quickly understand the public's interests and provide education on areas where interest is increasing."

In order to secure the competitiveness of companies, it is necessary to improve decision-making capacity using a classification algorithm. However, most of them do not have sufficient knowledge on what kind of classification algorithm is appropriate for a specific problem area. In other words, determining which classification algorithm is appropriate depending on the characteristics of the dataset was has been a task that required expertise and effort. This is because the relationship between the characteristics of datasets (called meta-features) and the performance of classification algorithms has not been fully understood. Moreover, there has been little research on meta-features reflecting the characteristics of multi-class. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to empirically analyze whether meta-features of multi-class datasets have a significant effect on the performance of classification algorithms. In this study, meta-features of multi-class datasets were identified into two factors, (the data structure and the data complexity,) and seven representative meta-features were selected. Among those, we included the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), originally a market concentration measurement index, in the meta-features to replace IR(Imbalanced Ratio). Also, we developed a new index called Reverse ReLU Silhouette Score into the meta-feature set.  Among the UCI Machine Learning Repository data, six representative datasets (Balance Scale, PageBlocks, Car Evaluation, User Knowledge-Modeling, Wine Quality(red), Contraceptive Method Choice) were selected. The class of each dataset was classified by using the classification algorithms (KNN, Logistic Regression, Nave Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM) selected in the study. For each dataset, we applied 10-fold cross validation method. 10% to 100% oversampling method is applied for each fold and meta-features of the dataset is measured. The meta-features selected are HHI, Number of Classes, Number of Features, Entropy, Reverse ReLU Silhouette Score, Nonlinearity of Linear Classifier, Hub Score. F1-score was selected as the dependent variable. As a result, the results of this study showed that the six meta-features including Reverse ReLU Silhouette Score and HHI proposed in this study have a significant effect on the classification performance. (1) The meta-features HHI proposed in this study was significant in the classification performance. (2) The number of variables has a significant effect on the classification performance, unlike the number of classes, but it has a positive effect. (3) The number of classes has a negative effect on the performance of classification. (4) Entropy has a significant effect on the performance of classification. (5) The Reverse ReLU Silhouette Score also significantly affects the classification performance at a significant level of 0.01. (6) The nonlinearity of linear classifiers has a significant negative effect on classification performance. In addition, the results of the analysis by the classification algorithms were also consistent. In the regression analysis by classification algorithm, Naïve Bayes algorithm does not have a significant effect on the number of variables unlike other classification algorithms. This study has two theoretical contributions: (1) two new meta-features (HHI, Reverse ReLU Silhouette score) was proved to be significant. (2) The effects of data characteristics on the performance of classification were investigated using meta-features. The practical contribution points (1) can be utilized in the development of classification algorithm recommendation system according to the characteristics of datasets. (2) Many data scientists are often testing by adjusting the parameters of the algorithm to find the optimal algorithm for the situation because the character"

In addition, considering the gentrification problem, which is one of the side effects of urban regeneration projects, it is important to select and implement urban regeneration types suitable for the characteristics of the area.  In order to supplement the limitations of the Urban Regeneration New Deal Project methodology, this study aims to propose a system that recommends urban regeneration types suitable for urban regeneration sites by utilizing various machine learning algorithms, referring to the urban regeneration types of the 2025 Seoul Metropolitan Government Urban Regeneration Strategy Plan promoted based on regional characteristics. There are four types of urban regeneration in Seoul: Low-use Low-Level Development, Abandonment, Deteriorated Housing, and Specialization of Historical and Cultural Resources (Shon and Park, 2017).  In order to identify regional characteristics, approximately 100,000 text data were collected for 22 regions where the project was carried out for a total of four types of urban regeneration. Using the collected data, we drew key keywords for each region according to the type of urban regeneration and conducted topic modeling to explore whether there were differences between types. As a result, it was confirmed that a number of topics related to real estate and economy appeared in old residential areas, and in the case of declining and underdeveloped areas, topics reflecting the characteristics of areas where industrial activities were active in the past appeared. In the case of the historical and cultural resource area, since it is an area that contains traces of the past, many keywords related to the government appeared. Therefore, it was possible to confirm political topics and cultural topics resulting from various events. Finally, in the case of low-use and under-developed areas, many topics on real estate and accessibility are emerging, so accessibility is good. It mainly had the characteristics of a region where development is planned or is likely to be developed.  Furthermore, a model was implemented that proposes urban regeneration types tailored to regional characteristics for regions other than Seoul. Machine learning technology was used to implement the model, and training data and test data were randomly extracted at an 8:2 ratio and used. In order to compare the performance between various models, the input variables are set in two ways: Count Vector and TF-IDF Vector, and as Classifier, there are 5 types of SVM (Support Vector Machine), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting.

The vegetative, reproductive, qualitative, and quantitative traits of tamarind vary widely. Characterization of phenotypic and genetic structure is essential for the selection of suitable accessions for sustainable cultivation and conservation. This study aimedto examine the genetic relationship among the collected accessions of sweet, red, and sour tamarind by using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primers. Nine accessions were collected from germplasm gene banks and subjected to marker analysis. Fifteen highly polymorphic primers generated a total of 169 fragments, out of which 138 bands were polymorphic. The polymorphic information content of RAPD markers varied from 0.10 to 0.44, and the Jaccard's similarity coefficient values ranged from 0.37 to 0.70. The genetic clustering showed a sizable genetic variation in the tamarind accessions at the molecular level. The molecular and biochemical variations in the selected accessions are very important for developing varieties with high sugar, anthocyanin, and acidity traits in the ongoing tamarind improvement program."
예보강우의 시간분포에 따른 청미천 유역의 홍수 확률 평가,2020,"['Flood', 'clark unit hydrograph method', 'forested-rainfall', 'MRC']",,"The objective of this study was to assess the flood probability based on temporal distribution of forecasted-rainfall in Cheongmicheon watershed. Inthis study, 6-hr rainfalls were disaggregated into hourly rainfall using the Multiplicative Random Cascade (MRC) model, which is a stochastic rainfalltime disaggregation model and it was repeated 100 times to make 100 rainfalls for each storm event. The watershed runoff was estimated using theClark unit hydrograph method with disaggregated rainfall and watershed characteristics. Using the peak discharges of the simulated hydrographs, theprobability distribution was determined and parameters were estimated. Using the parameters, the probability density function is shown and the floodprobability is calculated by comparing with the design flood of Cheongmicheon watershed. The flood probability results differed for various values ofrainfall and rainfall duration. In addition, the flood probability calculated in this study was compared with the actual flood damage in Cheongmicheonwatershed (R2 = 0.7). Further, this study results could be used for flood forecasting."
