The training data generally assumes that there are no errors, but in reality they include various types of errors, which cause performance degradation of systems trained using the data. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel method for detecting errors in the existing POS tagged corpus using the classifier of XGBoost and cross-validation as evaluation techniques. We first train a classifier of a POS tagger using the POS-tagged corpus with some errors and then detect errors from the POS-tagged corpus using cross-validation, but the classifier cannot detect errors because there is no training data for detecting POS tagged errors. We thus detect errors by comparing the outputs (probabilities of POS) of the classifier, adjusting hyperparameters. The hyperparameters is estimated by a small scale error-tagged corpus, in which text is sampled from a POS-tagged corpus and which is marked up POS errors by experts. In this paper, we use recall and precision as evaluation metrics which are widely used in information retrieval. We have shown that the proposed method is valid by comparing two distributions of the sample (the error-tagged corpus) and the population (the POS-tagged corpus) because all detected errors cannot be checked. In the near future, we will apply the proposed method to a dependency tree-tagged corpus and a semantic role tagged corpus."

As a result, there is a need for a method of minimizing costs through preventative grievance Preventive maintenance requires the establishment of a strategic plan through accurate prediction old Highway pavement. herefore, in this study, the XGBoost among machine learning classification-based models was used to develop a highway pavement damage prediction model. First, we solved the imbalanced data issue through data sampling, then developed a predictive model using the XGBoost. This predictive model was evaluated through performance indicators such as accuracy and F1 score. As a result, the over-sampling method showed the best performance result. On the other hand, the main variables affecting road damage were calculated in the order of the number of years of service, ESAL, and the number of days below the minimum temperature –2 degrees Celsius. If the performance of the prediction model is improved through more data accumulation and detailed data pre-processing in the future, it is expected that more accurate prediction of maintenance-required sections will be possible. In addition, it is expected to be used as important basic information for estimating the highway pavement maintenance budget in the future."
XGBoost를 활용한 리스크패리티 자산배분 모형에 관한 연구,2020,"['자산배분 모형', '리스크패리티', '포트폴리오 최적화', 'XGBoost', '추정 오차', 'asset allocation model', 'risk parity', 'portfolio optimization', 'estimated errors']",,"Artificial intelligences are changing world. Financial market is also not an exception. Robo-Advisor is actively being developed, making up the weakness of traditional asset allocation methods and replacing the parts that are difficult for the traditional methods. It makes automated investment decisions with artificial intelligence algorithms and is used with various asset allocation models such as mean-variance model, Black-Litterman model and risk parity model. Risk parity model is a typical risk-based asset allocation model which is focused on the volatility of assets. It avoids investment risk structurally. So it has stability in the management of large size fund and it has been widely used in financial field. XGBoost model is a parallel tree-boosting method. It is an optimized gradient boosting model designed to be highly efficient and flexible. It not only makes billions of examples in limited memory environments but is also very fast to learn compared to traditional boosting methods. It is frequently used in various fields of data analysis and has a lot of advantages. So in this study, we propose a new asset allocation model that combines risk parity model and XGBoost machine learning model. This model uses XGBoost to predict the risk of assets and applies the predictive risk to the process of covariance estimation. There are estimated errors between the estimation period and the actual investment period because the optimized asset allocation model estimates the proportion of investments based on historical data. these estimated errors adversely affect the optimized portfolio performance. This study aims to improve the stability and portfolio performance of the model by predicting the volatility of the next investment period and reducing estimated errors of optimized asset allocation model. As a result, it narrows the gap between theory and practice and proposes a more advanced asset allocation model.  In this study, we used the Korean stock market price data for a total of 17 years from 2003 to 2019 for the empirical test of the suggested model. The data sets are specifically composed of energy, finance, IT, industrial, material, telecommunication, utility, consumer, health care and staple sectors. We accumulated the value of prediction using moving-window method by 1,000 in-sample and 20 out-of-sample, so we produced a total of 154 rebalancing back-testing results. We analyzed portfolio performance in terms of cumulative rate of return and got a lot of sample data because of long period results. Comparing with traditional risk parity model, this experiment recorded improvements in both cumulative yield and reduction of estimated errors. The total cumulative return is 45.748%, about 5% higher than that of risk parity model and also the estimated errors are reduced in 9 out of 10 industry sectors. The reduction of estimated errors increases stability of the model and makes it easy to apply in practical investment. The results of the experiment showed improvement of portfolio performance by reducing the estimated errors of the optimized asset allocation model.  Many financial models and asset allocation models are limited in practical investment because of the most fundamental question of whether the past characteristics of assets will continue into the future in the changing financial market. However, this study not only takes advantage of traditional asset allocation models, but also supplements the limitations of traditional methods and increases stability by predicting the risks of assets with the latest algorithm. There are various studies on parametric estimation methods to reduce the estimated errors in the portfolio optimization. We also suggested a new method to reduce estimated errors in optimized asset allocation model using machine learning. So this study is meaningful in that it proposes an advanced artificial intelligence asset allocation model for the fast-developing financial markets."

In the field of atmospheric environment, studies related to fine dust have been traditionally performed using numerical models, but the research based on the machine learning has been conducted recently as the field of machine learning has developed. This study is about the prediction of ultrafine dust concentration, and it attempts to predict the middle (after 1 week) prediction while most of the existing studies are only short-term (after 1 hour to 2 days) prediction. A classification model was develeped to predict the average daily ultrafine dust concentration in Seoul by dividing it into two stages: normal (less than 36) and bad (more than 36). XGBoost was used as the classification model and an ensemble model was constructed after creating individual models through the hyperparameter optimization based on different evaluation indicators in order to maximize the performance of the model. The average daily fine dust concentration in Seoul from January to June 2019 was predicted after training the model using data from 2016 to 2018, and the performance of the ensemble model presented in this study was higher than that of a single model. In addition, the method of imbalance problem was applied since the number of cases where the level of fine dust is bad is much less than the number of cases where the level of fine dust is normal. It works effectively when only environmental material data is used as explanatory variables, but it adversely affects the performance of the model when both variables related to environmental materials and weather information are used."

For load forecasting, we employ XGBoost which is decision tree based gradient boosting algorithm. The XGBoost based load forecasting approach was analyzed in terms of feature importance and partial dependence plot. The experimental results show that the performance can be improved by selecting features which were found to have high importance in the SHAP analysis."

This study used computer vision and machine learning technologies to assess the architectural aesthetics and estimated the rent price of office buildings in Seoul.

Using the computer vision, we extracted feature vectors from images and conducted the machine learning to predict aesthetics from building images we collected. Controlling for structural and locational variables, we conducted both OLS and XGBoost estimates of the rent price measured as the monthly net occupancy cost. In the OLS, the results showed the significant effect of aesthetics on the rent price, but the image feature vector was not shown to increase the model fit. In the XGBoost, however, the image feature vector showed high importance among variables for the model fit. This study contributes to better specifying the price model via reducing the possibility of unobserved variable bias and using new techniques."

Applying Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict Potential Energies and Atomic Forces during C-H Activation,2020,"['Machine-learning potential', 'Tree-based algorithm', 'Feature-engineering']",,"Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are useful in understanding the interaction between solid materials and molecules. However, performing MD simulations is possible only when interatomic potentials are available and constructing such interatomic potentials usually requires additional computational work. Recently, generating interatomic potentials was shown to be much easier when machine learning (ML) algorithms were used. In addition, ML algorithms require new descriptors for improved performance. Here, we present an ML approach with several categories of atomic descriptors to predict the parameters necessary for MD simulations, such as the potential energies and the atomic forces. We propose several atomic descriptors based on structural information and find that better descriptors can be generated from eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Moreover, we observe fewer descriptors that perform better in predicting the potential energies and the forces during methane activation processes on a catalytic Pt(111) surface. These results were consistently observed in two different ML algorithms: fully-connected neural network (FNN) and XGBoost. Taking into account the advantages of FNN and XGBoost, we propose an efficient ML model for estimating potential energies. Our findings will be helpful in developing new ML potentials for long-time MD simulations."

A Framework of Using Machine Learning Approaches for Short‑Term Solar Power Forecasting,2020,['Short-term solar power forecasting · Machine learning · Feature selection'],,"Various machine learning approaches are widely applied for short-term solar power forecasting, which is highly demanded for renewable energy integration and power system planning. However, appropriate selection of machine learning models and data features is a signifcant challenge. In this study, a framework is developed to quantitatively evaluate various models and feature selection methods, and the best combination for short-term solar power forecasting is discovered. More specifcally, the machine learning methods include the random forest, artifcial neural network and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and the feature selection techniques include the feature importance and principle component analysis (PCA). All possible combinations of these machine learning and feature selection methods are developed and evaluated for solar power forecasting. The best ensemble of machine learning methods and feature selection techniques is identifed for solar power forecasting in Hawaii, US. Simulation results show that the XGBoost method with features selected by the PCA method outperforms the other approaches. In addition, the random forest and XGBoost models have rarely been used for short-term solar forecasting. This framework can be used to select appropriate machine learning approaches for short-term solar power forecasting and the simulation results can be used as a baseline for comparison."
기계 학습을 활용한 마그네슘 합금의 통전 비선형 온도 예측,2020,"['machine learning', 'magnesium', 'electropulse', 'electrically-assisted forming']",,"Electropulse-induced heating has attracted attention due to its high energy efficiency. However, the process gives rise to a nonlinear temperature variation, which is difficult to predict using a traditional physics model. As an alternative, this study employed machine-learning technology to predict such temperature variation for the first time. Mg alloy was exposed to a single electropulse with a variety of pulse magnitudes and durations for this purpose. Nine machine-learning models were established from algorithms from artificial neural network (ANN), deep neural network (DNN), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The ANN models showed an insufficient predicting capability with respect to the region of peak temperature, where temperature varied most significantly. The DNN models were built by increasing model complexity, enhancing architectures, and tuning hyperparameters. They exhibited a remarkable improvement in predicting capability at the heating-cooling boundary as well as overall estimation. As a result, the DNN-2 model in this group showed the best prediction of nonlinear temperature variation among the machinelearning models built in this study. The XGBoost model exhibited poor predicting performance when default hyperparameters were applied. However, hyperparameter tuning of learning rates and maximum depths resulted in a decent predicting capability with this algorithm. Furthermore, XGBoost models exhibited an extreme reduction in learning time compared with the ANN and DNN models. This advantage is expected to be useful for predicting more complicated cases including various materials, multi-step electropulses, and electrically-assisted forming."

Detecting PD usually requires a professional assessment by an expert, and investigation of the voice as abiomarker of the disease could be effective in speeding up the diagnostic process. Methods: We present our methodology inwhich we distinguish PD patients from healthy controls (HC) using a large sample of 18,210 smartphone recordings. Thoserecordings were processed by an audio processing technique to create a final dataset of 80,594 instances and 138 featuresfrom the time, frequency, and cepstral domains. This dataset was preprocessed and normalized to create baseline machinelearningmodels using four classifiers, namely, linear support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, random forest, and extremegradient boosting (XGBoost). We divided our dataset into training and held-out test sets. Then we used stratified5-fold cross-validation and four performance measures: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score to assess the performanceof the models. We applied two feature selection methods, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and least absolute shrinkageand selection operator (LASSO), to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset by selecting the best subset of features that maximizesthe performance of the classifiers. Results: LASSO outperformed ANOVA with almost the same number of features.With 33 features, XGBoost achieved a maximum accuracy of 95.31% on training data, and 95.78% by predicting unseen data.Conclusions: Developing a smartphone-based system that implements machine-learning techniques is an effective way todiagnose PD using the voice as a biomarker."

In other words, from the point of view of behavioral economics, we define that humans can make biased judgments by relying on the heuristic rather than making decisions by rational and reasonable judgments. From this perspective, the domestic real estate market has continuously developed behavioral economics research to explain the behavior of economic players in the housing market since the early 2000s. From the perspective of behavioral economics, this study attempts to identify the factors of decision-making on housing sales in each group through quantitative economic models through logistic regression analysis and machine learning models such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBost, LightGBM, Gradient Boosting, and MLP. It is also different from prior research in that it has applied a metering economy model and machine learning model to build a more predictable model of decision-making on housing sales. This study established the most predictable MLP model for decision-making on housing sales in each group, and the analysis showed that the loss group did not sell the house as the housing price rose, which can be interpreted as a result of the tendency to avoid selling and retain it even if the housing price is lost."
