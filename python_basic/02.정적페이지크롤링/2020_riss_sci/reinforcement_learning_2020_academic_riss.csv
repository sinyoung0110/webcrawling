PGA: An Efficient Adaptive Traffic Signal Timing Optimization Scheme Using Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning Algorithm,2020,"['Traffic signal timing', 'reinforcement learning', 'actor-critic', 'proximal policy optimization', 'generalized advantage estimation']",,"Advanced traffic signal timing method plays very important role in reducing road congestion and air pollution. Reinforcement learning is considered as superior approach to build traffic light timing scheme by many recent studies. It fulfills real adaptive control by the means of taking real-time traffic information as state, and adjusting traffic light scheme as action. However, existing works behave inefficient in complex intersections and they are lack of feasibility because most of them adopt traffic light scheme whose phase sequence is flexible. To address these issues, a novel adaptive traffic signal timing scheme is proposed. It's based on actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm, and advanced techniques proximal policy optimization and generalized advantage estimation are integrated. In particular, a new kind of reward function and a simplified form of state representation are carefully defined, and they facilitate to improve the learning efficiency and reduce the computational complexity, respectively. Meanwhile, a fixed phase sequence signal scheme is derived, and constraint on the variations of successive phase durations is introduced, which enhances its feasibility and robustness in field applications. The proposed scheme is verified through field-data-based experiments in both medium and high traffic density scenarios. Simulation results exhibit remarkable improvement in traffic performance as well as the learning efficiency comparing with the existing reinforcement learning-based methods such as 3DQN and DDQN."
Dynamic Action Space Handling Method for Reinforcement Learning Models,2020,"['Dance Tutorial System', 'Q-Learning', 'Reinforcement Learning', 'Virtual Tutor']",,"Recently, extensive studies have been conducted to apply deep learning to reinforcement learning to solve thestate-space problem. If the state-space problem was solved, reinforcement learning would become applicablein various fields. For example, users can utilize dance-tutorial systems to learn how to dance by watching andimitating a virtual instructor. The instructor can perform the optimal dance to the music, to which reinforcementlearning is applied. In this study, we propose a method of reinforcement learning in which the action space isdynamically adjusted. Because actions that are not performed or are unlikely to be optimal are not learned, andthe state space is not allocated, the learning time can be shortened, and the state space can be reduced. In anexperiment, the proposed method shows results similar to those of traditional Q-learning even when the statespace of the proposed method is reduced to approximately 0.33% of that of Q-learning. Consequently, theproposed method reduces the cost and time required for learning. Traditional Q-learning requires 6 million statespaces for learning 100,000 times. In contrast, the proposed method requires only 20,000 state spaces. A higherwinning rate can be achieved in a shorter period of time by retrieving 20,000 state spaces instead of 6 million."
The Implication of Bandura's Vicarious Reinforcement in Observational Learning for Christian Education,2020,,"이 논문은 관찰학습에서 나타나고 있는 반두라의 대리강화에 대한 이론과 효과들을 살펴보고, 그 개념을 기독교교육에서 행해지고 있는 영적 롤 모델링 전략에 적용한 연구이다. 이를 위해 먼저 반두라가 소개하고 있는 대리강화란 무엇이며, 관찰학습에서 대리강화가 어떻게 발생하는가 그리고 대리강화가 관찰자의 행동 변화에 어떠한 영향을 미치는가에 대하여 살펴보았다. 특별히 반두라는 관찰학습과 모방 혹은 반모방 행동 안에서 일어나는 학습과정에 대하여 개념화하였다. 이를 바탕으로 하여 반두라는 관찰학습에서 일어나는 대리강화의 과정을 4단계(집중, 기억, 행동재생, 그리고 동기화)로 분류하여 설명한다. 그뿐만이 아니라. 대리강화의 효과에 대해 3가지(관찰학습효과, 억제-탈억제효과, 유발효과)를 제시하였다. 이러한 반두라의 대리강화 이론과 그 효과를 바탕으로 하여 기독교교육에서 논의되고 있는 예수님 닮아가기 혹은 제자훈련 안에서의 영적 롤 모델링 전략을 재평가했다. 특별히 성경에서 사용하고 있는 모방에 대한 개념을 반두라의 대리강화 이론과 비교하면서 재해석하였고, 사도 바울이 제시하고 있는 영적 롤 모델의 역할을 대리강화의 효과라는 차원에서 재점검했다. 그 결과 2가지 차원에서의 영적 롤 모델 전략을 발견하였다. 즉 바울의 영적 롤 모델 역할은 긍정적인 차원에서 대리강화로써 신자로 하여금 기대되는 행동을 실행할 수 있도록 도와주는 하나의 본보기가 된다. 반면에 바울의 명령은 신자들에게 명확한 탈억제 효과를 불러일으키는 부정적인 차원에서의 대리강화로 사용되고 있음을 발견하였다. 그리고 마지막으로 관찰학습에 대한 연구들과 성경적 영적 롤 모델링 전략을 서로 연관시킴으로써 반두라의 대리강화가 기독교교육에 미칠 가능성을 함의하였다.","This study reviews Bandura's vicarious reinforcement in observational learning process and implies this concept into Christian education in terms of spiritual role modeling. The first part of this study answers three questions: ""what is vicarious reinforcement?"" ""how does vicarious reinforcement take place in observational learning?"" and ""how does vicarious reinforcement affect observer's behavior change?"" Bandura conceptualizes the learning process with observational learning and imitative or non-imitative performance. Based on this concept, Bandura define the roles of vicarious reinforcement in the four steps of observational learning process: attention, retention, motor reproduction, and motivational process. Also, the three effects of vicarious reinforcements are explained in the following categories: the observational learning effect, inhibitory or disinhibitory effects, and eliciting effect. Adapting the structure of observational learning theory in terms of the effect of vicarious reinforcement and the function of role models, the second part of this study examines the biblical concept of imitation of Christ and the modeling strategy of discipleship. Especially Paul's spiritual role model serves as positive vicarious reinforcement for the Christian believers to perform the desired behaviors. Also, Paul's condemnation serves as explicit negative vicarious reinforcement. Then, the last part of this study covers the implication of these findings from observational learning and empirical studies in terms of spiritual role modeling to Christian education."
Comparison of Reinforcement Learning Activation Functions to Improve the Performance of the Racing Game Learning Agent,2020,"['Activation Function', 'Racing Game', 'Reinforcement Learning']",,"Recently, research has been actively conducted to create artificial intelligence agents that learn games throughreinforcement learning. There are several factors that determine performance when the agent learns a game, butusing any of the activation functions is also an important factor. This paper compares and evaluates whichactivation function gets the best results if the agent learns the game through reinforcement learning in the 2Dracing game environment. We built the agent using a reinforcement learning algorithm and a neural network.We evaluated the activation functions in the network by switching them together. We measured the reward, theoutput of the advantage function, and the output of the loss function while training and testing. As a result ofperformance evaluation, we found out the best activation function for the agent to learn the game. Thedifference between the best and the worst was 35.4%."
AFRL: Adaptive Federated Reinforcement Learning for Intelligent Jamming Defense in FANET,2020,"['Federated learning', 'flying ad-hoc network', 'jamming attack', 'on-device AI', 'reinforcement learning.']",,"The flying ad-hoc network (FANET) is a decentralizedcommunication network for the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).Because of the wireless nature and the unique network properties, FANET remains vulnerable to jamming attack with additionalchallenges. First, a decision from a centralized knowledge base isunsuitable because of the communication and power constraintsin FANET. Second, the high mobility and the low density of theUAVs in FANET require constant adaptation to newly exploredspatial environments containing unbalanced data; rendering a distributed jamming detection mechanism inadequate. Third, takingmodel-based jamming defense actions in a newly explored environment, without a precise estimation of the transitional probabilities,is challenging. Therefore, we propose an adaptive federated reinforcement learning-based jamming attack defense strategy. Wedeveloped a model-free Q-learning mechanism with an adaptiveexploration-exploitation epsilon-greedy policy, directed by an ondevice federated jamming detection mechanism. The simulation results revealed that the proposed adaptive federated reinforcementlearning-based defense strategy outperformed the baseline methods by significantly reducing the number of en route jammer location hop counts. The results also showed that the average accuracy of the federated jamming detection mechanism, leveraged inthe defense strategy, was 39.9% higher than that of the distributedmechanism verified with the standard CRAWDAD jamming attackdataset and the ns-3 simulated FANET jamming attack dataset"
Analysis of Adverse Drug Reactions Identified in Nursing Notes Using Reinforcement Learning,2020,"['Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Electronic Health Records', 'Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning', 'Nursing Records']",,"Objectives: Electronic Health Records (EHRs)-based surveillance systems are being actively developed for detecting adverse drug reactions (ADRs), but this is being hindered by the difficulty of extracting data from unstructured records. This study performed the analysis of ADRs from nursing notes for drug safety surveillance using the temporal difference method in reinforcement learning (TD learning). Methods: Nursing notes of 8,316 patients (4,158 ADR and 4,158 non-ADR cases) admitted to Ajou University Hospital were used for the ADR classification task. A TD(λ) model was used to estimate state values for indicating the ADR risk. For the TD learning, each nursing phrase was encoded into one of seven states, and the state values estimated during training were employed for the subsequent testing phase. We applied logistic regression to the state values from the TD(λ) model for the classification task. Results: The overall accuracy of TD-based logistic regression of 0.63 was comparable to that of two machine-learning methods (0.64 for a naïve Bayes classifier and 0.63 for a support vector machine), while it outperformed two deep learning-based methods (0.58 for a text convolutional neural network and 0.61 for a long short-term memory neural network). Most importantly, it was found that the TD-based method can estimate state values according to the context of nursing phrases. Conclusions: TD learning is a promising approach because it can exploit contextual, time-dependent aspects of the available data and provide an analysis of the severity of ADRs in a fully incremental manner."
"Enhanced Machine Learning Algorithms: Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Q-Learning",2020,"['Deep Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Reinforcement Learning', 'Q-Learning']",,"In recent years, machine learning algorithms are continuously being used and expanded in various fields, suchas facial recognition, signal processing, personal authentication, and stock prediction.

Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with Discriminative Loss,2020,"['강화학습', '모델기반', '차별 손실 함수', '동작 구별', 'reinforcement learning', 'model-based RL', 'discriminative loss function', 'action discrimination']",,"Reinforcement learning is a framework for training the agent to make a good sequence of decisions through interacting with a complex environment. Although reinforcement learning has shown promising results in many tasks, sample efficiency still remains a major challenge for its real world application. We propose a novel model-based reinforcement learning framework that incorporates the discriminative loss function, in which models are trained to discriminate one action from another. The encoder pre-trained in this framework shows the feature alignment property, which aligns with the policy gradient method. The proposed method showed better sample efficiency than conventional model-based reinforcement learning approaches in the Atari game environment. In the early stage of the training, the proposed method surpassed the baseline by a large margin."
Analysis of Reward Functions in Deep Reinforcement Learning for Continuous State Space Control,2020,"['강화학습', '보상함수', '비-모델 강화학습', '보상함수 구조', '데이터 기반 제어', 'reinforcement learning', 'reward function', 'model-free reinforcement learning', 'reward structure', 'data-driven control']",,"Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), which uses deep neural networks for the approximation of the value function and the policy, in continuous state-space control tasks has recently shown promising results. However, the use of deep neural networks as function approximators has often resulted in intractable analyses of DRL algorithms mainly due to their non-convexities and thus a lack of theoretical guarantee such as asymptotic global convergence of the learning algorithm. Considering the fact that the reward function in reinforcement learning is one of the key entities that determines the overall characteristics of the learning agents, we focused on a smaller but an important aspect of the analysis, investigating the structure of widely used reward functions in DRL tasks and their possible effects on the learning algorithm. The proposed analysis may facilitate identification of appropriate reward functions in DRL tasks, which has often been conducted via trial and error."
A Comparison of Deep Reinforcement Learning and Deep learning for Complex Image Analysis,2020,"['Deep reinforcement learning', 'Deep learning', 'Complex images', 'CNN', 'DQN']",,"The image analysis is an important and predominant task for classifying the different parts of the image. The analysis of complex image analysis like histopathological define a crucial factor in oncology due to its ability to help pathologists for interpretation of images and therefore various feature extraction techniques have been evolved from time to time for such analysis. Although deep reinforcement learning is a new and emerging technique but very less effort has been made to compare the deep learning and deep reinforcement learning for image analysis. The paper highlights how both techniques differ in feature extraction from complex images and discusses the potential pros and cons. The use of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) in image segmentation, detection and diagnosis of tumour, feature extraction is important but there are several challenges that need to be overcome before Deep Learning can be applied to digital pathology. The one being is the availability of sufficient training examples for medical image datasets, feature extraction from whole area of the image, ground truth localized annotations, adversarial effects of input representations and extremely large size of the digital pathological slides (in gigabytes).Even though formulating Histopathological Image Analysis (HIA) as Multi Instance Learning (MIL) problem is a remarkable step where histopathological image is divided into high resolution patches to make predictions for the patch and then combining them for overall slide predictions but it suffers from loss of contextual and spatial information. In such cases the deep reinforcement learning techniques can be used to learn feature from the limited data without losing contextual and spatial information."

Model-free Adaptive Optimal Control of Episodic Fixed-horizon Manufacturing Processes Using Reinforcement Learning,2020,"['Adaptive optimal control', 'manufacturing process optimization', 'model-free optimal control', 'reinforcement learning.']",,"A self-learning optimal control algorithm for episodic fixed-horizon manufacturing processes with timediscrete control actions is proposed and evaluated on a simulated deep drawing process. The control model is built during consecutive process executions under optimal control via reinforcement learning, using the measured product quality as a reward after each process execution. Prior model formulation, which is required by algorithms from model predictive control and approximate dynamic programming, is therefore obsolete. This avoids several difficulties namely in system identification, accurate modeling, and runtime complexity, that arise when dealing with processes subject to nonlinear dynamics and stochastic influences. Instead of using the pre-created process and observation models, value-function-based reinforcement learning algorithms build functions of expected future reward, which are used to derive optimal process control decisions. The expectation functions are learned online, by interacting with the process. The proposed algorithm takes stochastic variations of the process conditions into account and is able to cope with partial observability. A Q-learning-based method for adaptive optimal control of partially observable episodic fixed-horizon manufacturing processes is developed and studied. The resulting algorithm is instantiated and evaluated by applying it to a simulated stochastic optimal control problem in metal sheet deep drawing."

We extended a deep deterministic policy gradient network to include convolutional layers for dealing with motion over multiple timesteps. A proxemics-based cost function for the robot to obtain the desired socially aware navigation behavior was developed and implemented in the learning stage, which respects the personal and intimate space of a human. The performed experiments in the simulated and real environments exhibited the desired behavior. Furthermore, the intrusions into the proxemics zones of a human were significantly reduced compared to similar learned robot navigation approachers."

An Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Device-to-device Communication Underlaying Cellular Network,2020,"['Device-to-device (D2D) Communications', 'Resource allocation', 'Actor-critic reinforcement learning', 'Optimal policy', 'Convergence', 'Throughput']",,"In this paper, a novel actor-critic reinforcement learning (RL) based on policy gradient is proposed to solve the channel and power allocation issues for a device-to-device (D2D) enabled cellular network when prior traffic information was not provided to the base station (BS). Furthermore, in this paper, we design a system to learn the optimal policy for resource and power allocation between cellular users (CUs) and D2D users, aimed at maximizing the sum rate of the overall system. Since the behavior of wireless channels, and the received reward in each state associated with the system, is stochastic in nature, the dynamic property of the environment allows us to apply an actor-critic RL technique to learn the best policy through continuous interaction with the surroundings. The policy-based approach is better than a value-based scheme, such as Qlearning, because it takes the help of policy space in order to maximize the expected throughput. The actor adopts a parameter-based stochastic policy for continuous actions, while the critic evaluates the policy through its overall performance, and criticizes the actor for the policy it follows. Through numerical simulations, we verify the performance of our proposed work with the existing methods."
Robotic Curved Surface Tracking with a Neural Network for Angle Identification and Constant Force Control based on Reinforcement Learning,2020,['Industrial robot · Surface tracking · Force control · Explicit force control · A2C · Reinforcement learning'],,"Aiming to solve the problem that the contact force at a robot end eff ector when tracking an unknown curved-surface workpieceis diffi cult to keep constant, a robot force control algorithm based on reinforcement learning is proposed. In this paper,a contact model and force mapping relationship are established for a robot end eff ector and surface. For the problem thatthe tangential angle of the workpiece surface is diffi cult to obtain in the mapping relationship, a neural network is used toidentify the tangential angle of the unknown curved-surface workpiece. To keep the normal force of the robot end eff ectorconstant, a compensation term is added to a traditional explicit force controller to adapt to the robot constant force trackingscenario. For the problem that the compensation term parameters are diffi cult to select, the reinforcement learning algorithmA2C (advantage actor critic) is used to fi nd the optimal parameters, and the return function and state values are modifi edin the A2C algorithm to satisfy the robot tracking scenario. The results show that the neural network algorithm has a goodrecognition eff ect on the tangential angle of the curved surface. The force error between the normal force and the expectedforce is substantially within ± 2 N after 60 iterations of the robot force control algorithm based on A2C; additionally, thevariance of the force error decreases by 50.7%, 34.05% and 79.41%, respectively, compared with the force signals obtainedby a fuzzy iterative algorithm and an explicit force control with two sets of fi xed control parameters."

By applying Qlearningapproach, each SU learns the occupancy pattern of theprimary channels thus forming a dynamic scanning preference list,so as to reduce the scanning overhead and access delay. To improvethe detection efficiency in dynamic environment, a discounted upperconfidence bound (D-UCB) based cooperation partner selectionalgorithm is devised wherein each SU learns the time varying detectionprobability of its neighbors, and selects the one with the potentiallyhighest detection probability as the cooperation partner.Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed cooperative spectrumsensing scheme achieves significant performance gain overvarious reference algorithms in terms of scanning overhead, accessdelay, and detection efficiency."

To tackle the input time-delay problem, the original system is transformed into a delay-free system with constrained-input and unknown input coupling term. In order to overcome the optimal control problem subject to constrained-input,a discounted value function is employed. In general, it is known that the HJB equation does not admit a classical smooth solution. Moreover, since the input coupling term of the delay-free system is unknown, a model-free integral reinforcement learning(IRL) algorithm which only requires the system sampling data generated by arbitrary different control inputs and external disturbances is proposed. The model-free IRL method is implemented on an actor-critic neural network (NN) structure. A system sampling data set is utilized to learn the value function and control policy. Finally, the simulation verifies the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

Image Preprocessing-based Generalization and Transfer of Learning for Grasping in Cluttered Environments,2020,"['AI-based application', 'grasping', 'reinforcement learning', 'sim-to-real transfer.']",,"In a cluttered environment in which objects are lying very closely to each other, the arranging motion is required before the robot attempts to grasp the target object. Thus, a robot must determine which motion to perform based on a given situation. This study presents an approach to learning a decision-making ability for the robot to grasp the target object after rearranging the surrounding objects obstructing the target object. The learning is performed in the virtual environment, and the image, which is an input of the deep Q-network, is preprocessed todirectly apply the results of the learning to the real environment. That is, the difference between the two environments is minimized by making the states obtained from the virtual and real environments similar to each other. In addition, image preprocessing can be used to generalize the results of learning so that the robot can determine the appropriate actions to take when objects that were not used for learning are given. A hierarchical structure, which consists of high-level and low-level motion selectors, is used for the learning: the former determines the grasping or pushing actions while the latter determines how to perform such selected actions. The results of various experiments show that the proposed scheme is effective in grasping the target object in a cluttered environment without the need for any additional learning in the real world."

A Deep-Q Learning Approach to Mobile Operator Collaboration,2020,"['Agent-based architectures', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'mobile networks', '5G', '6G.']",,"Next-generation mobile connectivity services includea large number of devices distributed across vast geographicalareas. Mobile network operators will need to collaborate tofulfill service requirements at scale. Existing approaches to multioperator services assume already-established collaborations tofulfill customer service demand with specific quality of service(QoS). In this paper, we propose an agent-based architecture,where establishment of collaboration for a given connectivityservice is done proactively, given predictions about future servicedemand. We build a simulation environment and evaluate ourapproach with a number of scenarios and in context of areal-world use case, and compare it with existing collaborationapproaches.

Evaluating the bond strength of FRP in concrete samples using machine learning methods,2020,"['FRP', 'ICA-ANN', 'ABC-ANN', 'prediction', 'bond strength']",,"In recent years, the use of Fiber Reinforced Polymers (FRPs) as one of the most common ways to increase the strength of concrete samples, has been introduced. Evaluation of the final strength of these specimens is performed with different experimental methods. In this research, due to the variety of models, the low accuracy and impact of different parameters, the use of new intelligence methods is considered. Therefore, using artificial intelligent-based models, a new solution for evaluating the bond strength of FRP is presented in this paper. 150 experimental samples were collected from previous studies, and then two new hybrid models of Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA)-Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)-ANN were developed. These models were evaluated using different performance indices and then, a comparison was made between the developed models. The results showed that the ICA-ANN model's ability to predict the bond strength of FRP is higher than the ABC-ANN model. Finally, to demonstrate the capabilities of this new model, a comparison was made between the five experimental models and the results were presented for all data. This comparison showed that the new model could offer better performance. It is concluded that the proposed hybrid models can be utilized in the field of this study as a suitable substitute for empirical models."
Computational estimation of the earthquake response for fibre reinforced concrete rectangular columns,2020,"['ANFIS', 'PSO', 'GA', 'ELM', 'fibre-reinforced concrete', 'Seismic response', 'compressive strength']",,"Due to the impressive flexural performance, enhanced compressive strength and more constrained crack propagation, Fibre-reinforced concrete (FRC) have been widely employed in the construction application. Majority of experimental studies have focused on the seismic behavior of FRC columns. Based on the valid experimental data obtained from the previous studies, the current study has evaluated the seismic response and compressive strength of FRC rectangular columns while following hybrid metaheuristic techniques. Due to the non-linearity of seismic data, Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) has been incorporated with metaheuristic algorithms. 317 different datasets from FRC column tests has been applied as one database in order to determine the most influential factor on the ultimate strengths of FRC rectangular columns subjected to the simulated seismic loading. ANFIS has been used with the incorporation of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic algorithm (GA). For the analysis of the attained results, Extreme learning machine (ELM) as an authentic prediction method has been concurrently used. The variable selection procedure is to choose the most dominant parameters affecting the ultimate strengths of FRC rectangular columns subjected to simulated seismic loading. Accordingly, the results have shown that ANFIS-PSO has successfully predicted the seismic lateral load with R2 = 0.857 and 0.902 for the test and train phase, respectively, nominated as the lateral load prediction estimator. On the other hand, in case of compressive strength prediction, ELM is to predict the compressive strength with R2 = 0.657 and 0.862 for test and train phase, respectively. The results have shown that the seismic lateral force trend is more predictable than the compressive strength of FRC rectangular columns, in which the best results belong to the lateral force prediction. Compressive strength prediction has illustrated a significant deviation above 40 Mpa which could be related to the considerable non-linearity and possible empirical shortcomings. Finally, employing ANFIS-GA and ANFIS-PSO techniques to evaluate the seismic response of FRC are a promising reliable approach to be replaced for high cost and time-consuming experimental tests."

Also, another recent research shows when the information observed by the agent from the environment is partial on complex control works, it indicates that the MC prediction is superior to the TD-based methods.

When intercepting a target, an unidentified evasion strategy causes a loss of optimality. To compensate for this problem, proper proportional navigation gain is derived at every time step by solving an optimal control problem with the inferred evader's strategy. Recently, deep reinforcement learning algorithms are introduced to deal with complex optimal control problem efficiently. We adapt the actor-critic method to build a proportional navigation gain network and the network is trained by the Proximal Policy Optimization(PPO) algorithm to learn an evasion strategy of the target.

It has been confirmed that adhocracy culture types have the highest market-sensing capacity and organizational learning level. Upon verification of the hypotheses, First, clan culture in relation to market sensing capacity was not identified any relationship, and the hierarchy culture was confirmed to the market-sensing capacity with negative relationship. Market culture and adhocracy culture have a positive relationship to market-sensing capacity, and the relationship between market culture is confirmed to be relatively higher to market-sensing level compared to adhocracy culture.Second, the market-sensing capacity was identified as the positive relationship between financial performance and non-financial performance. This is the same result as prior research, supporting the rationale that market-sensing capabilities have a positive influence on business performance.Third, after verifying the coordination effect of organizational culture type, market-sensing capability and organizational learning between management performance, significant adjustment effect was confirmed. However, while the adjustment effect of organizational learning by type of organization was not confirmed after verification of the effect of controlling organizational learning by organization culture, the adjustment effect of positive in strengthening market-sensing capability was confirmed in market-oriented and innovation-oriented culture. Organizational learning levels also identified the positive adjustment effect of market-sensing capabilities and financial performance and non-financial performance and showed greater control over financial performance compared to non-financial performance. These results support the positive effects of organizational learning on strengthening internal capabilities.The establishment of a new management paradigm in the era of the fourth industrial revolution should take precedence in establishing a platform for marketing activities through strengthening organizational learning. Thus, organizational culture types should be transformed into a market and adhocracy culture, and by changing organizational culture through organizational learning, the establishment of a platform to enhance market-sensing capabilities and management performance of organizational members will be required."

Now, art education will also need to devise new teaching methods that can overcome the limitations of the existing teaching methods. This study aims to examine the learning effectiveness and educational meaning of the directing practicum class, which is applied with the new teaching method, by designing and operating the online teaching method in the directing practicum class, which had been conducted offline in the theater department.In previous directing classes, the project-based learning method had been applied and got many positive responses from students, but 3-hour session was too short to make the students' satisfaction level to reach its peak. To compensate the lack of time, the flip-learning was incorporated in designing this new teaching method and on-line materials were given to students before each class.As for research method, first, on- and off-line methods were combined, second, the weekly class plans were designed accordingly, and then each class was operated and evaluated to find out how students' satisfaction progressed. The new teaching method is named “Project-based flip-learning”, which examines both purpose and principle of project-based learning method and flip-learning. Each week, a newly derived project-based flip-learning was applied in the directing practicum class. Thus, the results of the application of the new teaching method were analyzed by the researchers' self-assessment and the survey of the learners' satisfaction in education to analyze the learning effects and educational implications of art practice classes.Through research result, self-assessment, and class satisfaction survey, it showed generally positive effects such as the active and self-led transformation of learners' attitude, the facilitation of students' interaction, and the improvement of learning effectiveness. On the other hand, the inconvenience of having to learn in advance through online video lectures was negative. Consequently, the design and operation of the classes by applying project-based flip-runs to the directing practicum class was deemed to require further expansion of the application of these teaching methods as the educational effects improve, although there are inconveniences in online classes."

In addition, the proposed model uses a novel path-based reward function designed to solve the problem of existing goal-based reward functions. In this paper, we demonstrate the high performance of the proposed model through various experiments using both Matterport3D simulation environment and R2R benchmark dataset."

To this end, we analyzed precedent research related to collaborative mentoring and formed a teacher learning community centered on the same grade for the curriculum reconstruction. We also interviewed a group of experts acting as mentors in the teacher learning community and conducted basic research on core competencies through an open questionnaire. Through the Delphi survey of the expert group and the selection of core competencies, 20 core competencies that mentor teachers should possess were drawn. Next, through the selection meeting of the final core competency experts (12 people), the final 18 mentor teachers core competencies were selected by excluding core competencies that were difficult to reinforce with short-term training alone and those that were already reflected in existing training programs and overlapped. In addition, in order to construct a systematic collaborative mentoring program, the core competencies that a mentor should possess were classified into three competency groups: teaching design competency, teaching facilitation competency, and reflection support competency. The core competencies reflected in the collaborative mentoring program were then readjusted into sub-competencies of individuals and situations and sub-competencies of knowledge and skills for each competency group, and the collaborative mentoring program was developed by modularizing them. Lastly, in order to effectively operate a collaborative mentoring program in the teacher learning community, each module was composed of four stages: competency diagnosis, collaborative learning, competency development, and application practice. The application of this collaborative mentoring program is expected to be a practical improvement for strengthening the core competencies of mentor teachers working in the teacher learning community and practicing curriculum reconstruction."

The details of the reform indicate that the high school credit system is at the center of the high school education system reform.This study aimed to re-examine the direction of music education in relation to the introduction of the high school credit system, thus researching on action plans concerning the guarantee of the right to learn Korean music. The findings of the study are as follows.Firstly, the introduction of the high school credit system is not a policy that changes the standards of academic achievement or graduation accreditation from a grade level system or a unit system to a credit system, but a policy that is related to the right to learn that enables students to choose subjects considering their aptitudes and career pathways and to receive a high-quality education that meets the achievement standards of each subject. Thus, it is necessary to guarantee a student’s right to select subjects by offering various music curricular courses in order to realize the high school credit system in the music department. In addition, teaching and learning should take place in consideration of an individual student’s growth based on achievement standards, and high-quality subject learning should be realized through process-oriented evaluation.Secondly, the action plans of Korean music education for the high school credit system include a measure of expanding a right to select the subject of Korean music and cases for realizing process-oriented evaluation for each teacher. It is expected that Korean music courses will be more offered in many high schools by offering Korean music in various ways and showing examples of providing students with opportunities to complete the courses.This study is the first step for such changes. It is hoped that more specific research will be continued to guarantee the right to learn Korean music and to support the real learning field."

In particular, it is not easy to detect when a worker falls down, making it difficult to respond quickly. Thus, research is being conducted to detect fallen workers using a camera or by attaching a device to the body. Existing image-based fall detection systems have been designed to detect a person's body parts; hence, it is difficult to detect them in various ships and postures. In this study, the entire fall area was extracted and deep learning was used to detect the fallen shipworker based on the image. The data necessary for learning were obtained by recording falling states at the shipyard. The amount of learning data was augmented by flipping, resizing, and rotating the image. Performance evaluation was conducted with precision, reproducibility, accuracy, and a low error rate. The larger the amount of data, the better the precision. In the future, reinforcing various data is expected to improve the effectiveness of camera-based fall detection models, and thus improve safety."

In this context, this study identified the effect of educational service quality perceived by the students, who had a class at vocational training institutes involved in cooking, on learning transfer. Furthermore, this study elucidated the mediating effect of learner satisfaction. The following results were derived. Firstly, the higher the education service quality was perceived, the higher the learning transfer appeared. Therefore, in terms of educational service perspective, the educational institutions are required not only to provide students with various services appropriate to the purposes of vocational training institutes such as information offering for occupations, opportunities for employment and career counseling but also to reinforce personal social services including improvement of the administration services or kindness of school personnel. Secondly, it was revealed that learner satisfaction completely mediates the association between education service quality and learning transfer. Although maintaining the education service quality is also important factor, a priority should be placed on the learner satisfaction. In order to make this happen, the students should be provided with psychological and economical satisfactions."

To collect data, on-site survey was conducted by students majoring in hotel and tourism studies at several Universities in Korea from October 05 to 10, 2020. The data were analyzed in using various statistical methods such as descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, reliability test, PLS-SEM along with bootstrapping techniques. The results revealed that the relationship between the variables, recognition of curriculum(RC) and learning flow and RC and career decision-making self-efficacy(CDS), have significantly related with each other. Students’ learning flow was also positively related with career decision making self-efficacy. However, RC was insignificantly connected with academic achievement, and there was no significant relationship between the academic achievement and CDS. Thus, these findings suggest that universities should come up with a plan for structural reform of the curriculum so that students can cultivate new skills required by companies or industries in the future era (e.g., the Fourth Industrial Revolution).

First, an examination of the reflection sheets of learners in a Japanese class revealed that the components of learner autonomy, such as “motivation or affective factors,” “metacognition factors,” and “learning strategy factors.” This indicates the possibility that reflection activities using sheets implicitly promoted the learner to elicit the above factors. Secondly, through metareflection as an explicit action that can be associated with autonomous learning, whether reflection activities helped to enhance learner autonomy, and, if so, what is the reason, was examined. The result reveals that most learners perceived positively; further, it was possible to confirm the possibility that metacognition which was specifically mentioned, was activated to reinforce the awareness of autonomous learning. Finally, to determine if consciousnessraising in reflection activities affects behavior, such as the use of learning strategies. A selfregulated learning strategy scale survey was conducted, which consisted of five factors: a) “reflecting on learning”; b) “devising learning”; c) “asking peers”; d) “developing a learning plan”; and e) “rewarding oneself.” As a result, the use of learning strategies before and after reflection activities and their changes were identified, with results that suggested a positive effect. These findings show that reflection activities may not only promote and reinforce learners’ awareness of autonomous learning but also helped to induce the use of autonomous learning strategies."

In addition, the factorization game have the advantage of controlling the uncertainty of the game state and action by adjusting the game board size n and game value p. In particular, if the value of n increases, the winning strategy is uncertain because the number of cases increases exponentially. Looking at this from the perspective of reinforcement learning, it means uncertainty in state and action. Accordingly, by setting the board size of n to 6 or less, a factorization game agent is created that adjusts the uncertainty. In this paper, we apply the reinforcement learning algorithms Q-learning, Double DQN, and Monte Carlo tree search to the factorization game, and show that learning progress through winning rate and analysis.

AI network learns by taking the target position and control policy as input and yielding the evaluation as output. Then, the task is carried out by predicting the success probability according to the target location and control policy and searching the policy with the highest probability. Repeating this task can result in performance improvements as data accumulates. And this model can even predict tasks that were not previously attempted which means it is an universally applicable learning model for any new environment.

Twenty five elementary school students in grades 1-5 in Seoul currently learning violin were selected as participants. They were asked to watch the video of the violin education content “Violin Structure and Name” available on the YouTube channel. The students were subsequently interviewed and opinions were exchanged, while taking all necessary precautions amid the rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 patients. The study concludes the following. First, students believe that YouTube enables learning through free viewing, and that it is easy to communicate and share views with other violin learners. In addition, it was revealed that the effect of learning can be enhanced by allowing infinite viewing through repeated playback of YouTube videos. Second, regarding the merits of the “violin structure and name” subject video, online learning can substitute offline classes amid the unprecedented situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Online learning enables effective learning, saves time, and it is possible to respond to queries through comments. Third, as to the disadvantages of the subject video, it is necessary to create a video that considers students’ perspectives and targets the desired audience. In particular, in the case of videos targeting elementary school students, it was suggested to include elements that would be liked by elementary school students to increase their concentration and to reduce eye strain by making short videos. Lastly, comment management is important to prevent emotional stress because of unnecessary comments on the video. Thus, it is necessary to reinforce strategies to promote awareness and competitiveness through the growth and management of contents along with the production of videos on various topics related to violin learning."

The process was applied to operational works of NPPs.Results: Case studies for applying the process showed that it could effectively identify good practices and that it had a potential to reinforce safety culture through the process implementation as well as the identified good practices. Good practices from successful work cases were evaluated to be worthy of workers"" learning since there would be no chances to derive them from failure cases.Conclusion: Applying the process for identifying and sharing good practices for safety culture will contribute to the internalization of safety culture in the field workers in NPPs and help the organization find valuable insights to improve safety culture in the reality of operational works. If efforts are continued to learn from successes, interests in safety culture will be maintained and ultimately nuclear safety will be ensured.Application: The process to identify good practices can be applied not only to NPPs but also to other safety fields such as the radiation use and aviation industry."

This study proposes a reinforcement learning-based intersection signal model to minimizing waiting time. Based on Deep Q-Network algorithm, RL model computes signal patterns that reduce traffic congestion by taking into account real-time traffic flow. For practical applicability, RL model learning was performed including signal sequences and minimum green time constraints. Using a micro-traffic simulator, we compared the performance of RL model with the traditional model, and we found that RL model had better results in the evaluation indicators such as waiting times and the number of stops."

And to discuss how useful narratives work in education. The narrative experience is accompanied by reflective and critical thinking. Considering the interaction between narrative and human development, we can understand the narrative involved in education. The way of narrative is a metaphor for the way of existence of education. The narrative itself has a prototype of education. The old narrative gives us the validity of educational wisdom that is not easily broken down. Narratives exist as a form of learning. The wholeness of the narrative is not easily dissected. The way of narrative is closely related to the way of experience. Therefore, it responds well to the convergence education needed in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Storytelling shows the dynamic of narrative. As the media diversify, storytelling has a variety of communication effects. Thus, narratives that were recognized as content or structure centered are now recognized as working in a variety of ways. Narratives reinforce learners motivations in a variety of ways and help them to think more dynamically. Narrative is rich in context. The educational practice of narrative can be embodied by transferring storytelling to learning activities. Narrative and storytelling should be identified as an organic connection, and the cultural functions and educational actions of storytelling should be implemented on-site. This is a future-oriented expansion of the practice horizon of education."

First of all, the pattern was drawn for a child with harm avoidance to be vulnerable to develop anxiety. It is explained that when a child with harm avoidance was placed in a lack of support, the child became vulnerable to develop anxiety because of negative memories related to threat stimuli-respond and automatic avoidance. Next, the study examined how animal assisted play therapy influences for a child with harm avoidance to accumulate positive memories and control automatic avoidance through the case study method. As a result, experiential processes were derived from the analysis of dynamics between a child and a therapy dog; ‘the process of automatic avoidance and new experiential learning’ and ‘the process of reinforcing positive memories and controling avoidance’. Based on the findings, the authors discussed the therapeutic meanings of animal assisted play therapy which is to encourage a child with harm avoidance to control a tendency to avoid."

To examine the relationship between reading miscues and reading strategies by learners of each level, a class of second graders of middle school in Cheongju, Chungbuk was randomly selected and a miscue analysis experiment was conducted on 23 students. The miscue analysis followed the RMI (Reading Miscue Inventory) procedure initiated by Goodman (2005). The results are as follows. First, the number of the errors of the lower group was less than that of the middle group, suggesting that the lower group needs to be encouraged to have a risk-taking attitude and provided with an encouraging feedback. Second, for the middle and the lower group, there occurred various error types, which cause difficulty with their understanding of the text. This indicates the need to provide level-specific English reading instructions based on learners’ reading strategies and characteristics. Third, all three groups have the same high ratio of the errors related to phonetic cues, indicating that they rely heavily on phonetic cues and that learning English sounds and letters, which is not currently specified in the middle school English curriculum, still needs to be reinforced."

The transmissive lecture could be effective in conveying much information to large group learners in a relatively short period of time. However, the one-way transmissive religious education of Christian university separates between: learner-text; learner-learner; learner-teacher, and further weakens Christian identity. In that sense, we need to investigate the possibility of utilizing relationship-oriented havruta as an alternative to overcome the limitation of transmissive religious educational paradigm in Christian university. Havruta is a tool to convey Jewish beliefs and traditions and strengthen Jewish identity. At the same time, havruta is a relationship-based educational method. From a relational perspective, havruta is performed only in relationship. Focusing on the relationships between: learner-text; learner-learner; learner-teacher, one practices havruta with a sense of responsibility in part for each other’s learning. In this article, I intend to explore havruta, which pursues relationship as an alternative to overcome the one-way lecture-style religious education of Christian university as follows. First, I examine the situation of segregation of learner-text, learner-learner, and learner-teacher relationship, which is the problem of religious education in Christian university. Second, I scrutinize the main concepts of havruta by focusing on the definition, principles, and stages, Korean educational model of havruta from a relational point of view. Third, I investigate the possibility of applying havruta in religious education to form and reinforce diverse relationships through the case of B religious education at A Christian University. Finally, I conclude by presenting how Christian university should move forward in religious education through havruta. Therefore, in the mutual cooperative relationships among text, learner, and teacher, we expect havruta to surmount the paradigm of transmissive religious education in Christian university and to further strengthen the identity of Christian university."

However, many studies in previous work performed their tasks solely on robots without factoring human cooperation. Therefore, in this paper, we propose cooperative robot for table balancing using Q-learning that enables cooperative work between human and robot. The human’s action is recognized in order to balance the table by the proposed robot whose camera takes the image of the table’s state, and it performs the table-balancing action according to the recognized human action without high performance equipment. The classification of human action uses a deep learning technology, specifically AlexNet, and has an accuracy of 96.9% over 10-fold cross-validation. The experiment of Q-learning was carried out over 2,000 episodes with 200 trials. The overall results of the proposed Q-learning show that the Q function stably converged at this number of episodes. This stable convergence determined Q-learning policies for the robot actions. Video of the robotic cooperation with human over the table balancing task using the proposed Q-Learning can be found at http://ibot.knu.ac.kr/videocooperation.html."

AugGAIL has several important extensions compared to GAIL such as replacing TRPO-based policy updates with more efficient PPO-based ones, incorporating task-oriented rewards into the original reward function, applying a novel data sampling strategy to train the discriminator more efficiently, and pre-training the policy network similar to that of behavioral cloning. In this study, we applied the AugGAIL learning model to several robotic object manipulation tasks with continuous state-action space, including pick-up, pick-and-place, and stack. In various experiments using a simulated Jaco arm robot, AugGAIL showed higher efficiency and performance than other imitation learning models."
DeNERT: DQN과 BERT를 이용한 개체명 인식 모델,2020,"['Natural language processing', 'Named entity recognition', 'Reinforcement learning', 'BERT', 'DQN', 'Language model', '자연어처리', '개체명 인식', '강화학습', '언어모델']",,"In this paper, we propose a new structured entity recognition DeNERT model. Recently, the field of natural language processing has been actively researched using pre-trained language representation models with a large amount of corpus. In particular, the named entity recognition, which is one of the fields of natural language processing, uses a supervised learning method, which requires a large amount of training dataset and computation. Reinforcement learning is a method that learns through trial and error experience without initial data and is closer to the process of human learning than other machine learning methodologies and is not much applied to the field of natural language processing yet. It is often used in simulation environments such as Atari games and AlphaGo. BERT is a general-purpose language model developed by Google that is pre-trained on large corpus and computational quantities. Recently, it is a language model that shows high performance in the field of natural language processing research and shows high accuracy in many downstream tasks of natural language processing. In this paper, we propose a new named entity recognition DeNERT model using two deep learning models, DQN and BERT. The proposed model is trained by creating a learning environment of reinforcement learning model based on language expression which is the advantage of the general language model. The DeNERT model trained in this way is a faster inference time and higher performance model with a small amount of training dataset. Also, we validate the performance of our model’s named entity recognition performance through experiments."

Deep RL Based Notch Filter Design Method for Complex Industrial Servo Systems,2020,"['Deep reinforcement learning', 'highly complex servo system', 'multiple notch filters', 'resonance suppression.']",,"This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) method for simultaneously designing several notch filters in complex industrial servo systems. Notch filters are highly effective for suppressing resonances in motion control systems and are widely utilized in industry. However, severe limitations exist in complex servo systems because there are many vibration modes that are difficult to identify. In such cases, several notch filters must be used, but the task of tuning these filters involves lengthy empirical procedures by well-experienced engineers. To automate this tuning process, this paper proposes a novel design method that can design several notch filters simultaneously for the first time. In this method, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm with a vector stability margin as the reward function is utilized to find filter parameters in the frequency domain. The proposed method simultaneously finds a set of many parameters for several notch filters that are optimal with respect to stability. Using a real industrial servo system that has multiple resonances, it is demonstrated that the proposed method effectively finds the optimal parameters for several notch filters and successfully suppresses multiple resonances to provide desired performances."

New framework for adaptive and agile honeypots,2020,"['adaptive', 'agile', 'framework', 'honeypots', 'reinforcement learning']",,"This paper proposes a new framework for the development and deployment of honeypots for evolving malware threats. As new technological concepts appear and evolve, attack surfaces are exploited. Internet of things significantly increases the attack surface available to malware developers. Previously independent devices are becoming accessible through new hardware and software attack vectors, and the existing taxonomies governing the development and deployment of honeypots are inadequate for evolving malicious programs and their variants. Malware-propagation and compromise methods are highly automated and repetitious. These automated and repetitive characteristics can be exploited by using embedded reinforcement learning within a honeypot. A honeypot for automated and repetitive malware (HARM) can be adaptive so that the best responses may be learnt during its interaction with attack sequences. HARM deployments can be agile through periodic policy evaluation to optimize redeployment. The necessary enhancements for adaptive, agile honeypots require a new development and deployment framework."

Robust Experimental Study of Data-driven Optimal Control for an Underactuated Rotary Flexible Joint,2020,"['External disturbance', 'model-free optimal control', 'reinforcement learning', 'robustness study', 'rotary flexible joint', 'system uncertainty.']",,"As an important component of industrial robot, the motion control of rotary flexible joint (RFJ) system is of great significance, especially when the system has unmodeled dynamics or is seriously disturbed. This paper presents an experimental robustness study on a kind data-driven optimal control approach based on an underactuated rotary flexible joint system. The data-driven approach combines the off-policy optimal control algorithm and the popular integral reinforcement learning technique. Through literature review, we find that the key step of the control design lies in that it learns the optimal value function and control policy simultaneously from the input and output (I/O) data. However, the I/O data are often disturbed by the system uncertainty or environmental noise, and then it will indirectly affect the optimal control performance. To investigate the robustness of the data-driven optimal control approach, we artificially set different experimental scenarios and take numerous control experiments on a RFJ experimental setup. The experimental results show that the data-driven optimal control method is quite robust against the system uncertainties in terms of maintaining the stability and delivering satisfactory tracking performance, even when the uncertainty is not a small quantity. In addition, the disturbance originating from environmental noise has certain impact on the controlling of RFJ system, but as long as the noise power is not too large, the control algorithm can converge to a satisfactory result. Finally, we find that the probing signal up has strong influence to this control algorithm, which reminds us to be cautious when selecting the probing signal."

A quad-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with nonlinear geometric tracking controller is introduced to test our approach. In the geometric controller, two attitude gains must be provided appropriately to achieve stable error dynamics. To ease the difficulties while optimizing the controller performances, such as minimizing tracking error together with reducing control energy, we made Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents to substitute the entire gain tuning process. By training the RL agents with multiple quad-rotor configurations, we were not only able to reduce our efforts putting into the gain tuning by the trial-and-error methods, but also able to deal with the parameter changes by constructing an adaptive structure."

SDN, which is not proposedspecifically for edge computing, can in fact serve as an enablerto lower the complexity barriers involved and let the realpotential of edge computing be achieved. In this paper, we investigatethe task offloading and resource allocation problem in wirelessMEC aiming to minimize the delay while saving the battery powerof user device simultaneously. However, it is challenging to obtainan optimal policy in such a dynamic task offloading system. Learningfrom experience plays a vital role in time variant dynamic systemswhere reinforcement learning (RL) takes a long term goal intoconsideration besides immediate reward, which is very importantfor a dynamic environment. A novel software defined edge cloudlet(SDEC) based RL optimization framework is proposed to tacklethe task offloading and resource allocation in wireless MEC. Specifically,Q-learning and cooperative Q-learning based reinforcementlearning schemes are proposed for the intractable problem. Simulationresults show that the proposed scheme achieves 31.39% and62.10% reduction on the sum delay compared to other benchmarkmethods such as traditional Q-learning with a random algorithmand Q-learning with epsilon greedy."

This is a generation method that actively applies the improved physics engine and artificial intelligence reinforced by deep learning to make the character's movement, dialogue, and natural environment effects in real time in the game engine. As free deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow are activated and GAN learning methods along with CNN and RNN learning methods become generalized, the results of artificial intelligence show a quality that is indistinguishable from the original.

However, existing damage localization methods cannot be used for localizing the damage of bridges in real time because of their slow testing speed. Thus, in this study a damage localization approach was developed using a convolutional neural network (CNN). To develop the CNN model for damage localization, simulation data was generated through a numerical model of a reinforced concrete Rahmen bridge with static loading conditions. The proposed CNN-based approach aims to identify 12 single damage locations or no damage. The approach was trained and tested with three different data set generated with three damage severities, and it was possible to estimate the damage location with an accuracy of 87.3% when the damage severity in the bridge is serious. The results showed that the deep learning has the potential to overcome the limitations of existing damage localization techniques."

Both positive and negative reinforcement appear to shape our behavioral adaptation by modulating the function of the basal ganglia. Here, we examined a transgenic mouse line (G2CT) in which synaptic transmissions onto the medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the basal ganglia are depressed. We found that the level of collaterals from direct pathway MSNs in the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe) ('bridging collaterals') was decreased in these mice, and this was accompanied by behavioral inhibition under stress. Furthermore, additional manipulations that could further decrease or restore the level of the bridging collaterals resulted in an increase in behavioral inhibition or active behavior in the G2CT mice, respectively.

This survey was conducted on 369 learners who took the K-MOOC. Among them, 51.5%(190 learners) were female learners and 48.5%(179 learners) were male learners. 50.1%(185 learners) completed the course, and 49.9%(184 learners) did not complete the course. As a result of the analysis, among the characteristics of K-MOOC, teaching presence had the greatest influence on the PUU, followed by interest and trust. It was analyzed that PUU not only had a positive effect on the educational effectiveness, but also partially mediated the characteristics of K-MOOC and the educational effectiveness. The analysis results suggest that the PUU for educational effectiveness is a very important factor in that most of the higher education is conducted online due to the recent spread of the COVID-19. Finally, learning expectation was analyzed to partially mediate the relationship between the PUU and educational effectiveness, and it was confirmed that the learner s expectations for K-MOOC had a positive effect on the educational effectiveness. The research results support the need for K-MOOC, which is expected to expand further in the post-corona era, to provide PUU by reinforcing trust, teaching presence, and interest factors."

Among the various types, the Karl Popper-style debate method, which is assessed to be the most suitable for educational purposes in high school or college classes, was adopted. As the pilot case for high school students, a debate program was implemented, combining an orientation, a collaborative discussion, and a simplified Karl Popper format debate. The results of the survey after the implementation of the program showed that the debate activity gave ordinary students who had no special interests or knowledge in the “Economy” subject or “Debates” a high degree of program satisfaction and awareness of economic knowledge. Students also actively provided their formative feedbacks about the program. They appropriately pointed out the strengths of the program, including the experience of discussions, the outcomes of education, and the way the education operates. Also, regarding the improvement of the program, reasonable suggestions were made, such as adjusting class time, amount and difficulty of learning contents reinforcing orientation, and improving the operation method to expand participation opportunities.

For a rigorous understanding of this relationship, this study developed a research framework that includes the internalization of beauty ideals and body satisfaction through literature reviews of relevant studies. In total, five hypotheses were established within the research framework and data were collected through an online survey with 107 Korean female adolescents aged 15–17 years. The collected data were analyzed through confirmatory factor analysis, higher-order factor analysis, and structural equation modeling. The results showed that the internalization of beauty ideals negatively affected body satisfaction. Adolescent makeup reinforced by the internalization of beauty ideals improved body satisfaction, which had a suppression effect on the decline in body satisfaction caused by the internalization of beauty ideals. Additionally, both body satisfaction and adolescent makeup positively influenced school adjustment. These results could reduce the generation gap regarding adolescent makeup and provide educational and industrial implications for Korean society."

One way of filling seats is by recruiting international students. These students can be economically beneficial as they often pay higher tuition costs and contribute to local economies through living expenses (OECD, 2020). A growing trend making non-Anglophone countries attractive to these students is English as a method of instruction (EMI) classes. EMI courses teach subject matter in classes such as business, tourism, and international relations in English, even though it may not be the native language of any of the students in the classroom. In order to provide satisfactory learning environments for these students, it is necessary to utilize varied and contemporary teaching methods. One such method is the incorporation of movies in order to illustrate key topics and aid in retention.

Before and after the implementation of the curriculum, a questionnaire was conducted to examine their adaptive expertise in terms of knowledge, practice, attitude, and willingness. Results indicated that the curriculum was beneficial to their knowledge of, practice in, and attitude to AI chatbot technology for English education, but less effective in reinforcing their willingness to use the AI technology. The effects of the curriculum were further evaluated by the SAMR model (substitution, augmentation, modification, and redefinition), which encompasses multiple levels of pedagogical application of new technology (Puentedura, 2013), and it was found that the curriculum not only enhanced but also transformed learning experiences of the pre-service teachers.

In Hong Kong, curriculum and examination are ever-changing in order to provide better education for learners. Since 2004, a Territory-wide System Assessment (TSA) has been implemented into the school curriculum. Teachers have been seen as the major agents to foster positive washback effects. However, little research has been conducted on the washback effects of TSA at the primary school level and teachers’ voices have been overlooked. To fill this gap, this study explores teachers’ perceptions and behavioural changes under the context of the school-based examination change. It also investigates the phenomenon of the washback effect in light of school policy, English curriculum development, and school-based exams in a Hong Kong local primary school. A semi-structured interview has been conducted in a local primary school with three English teachers instructing elite, normal and small classes in the same level. Around ten questions were asked about examination changes and teachers’ workload. The interviews were recorded and later been transcribed for data analysis. The main findings reinforce how washback effects can be influenced by the length of the lesson, intensity of teaching content, students’ language foundation, and learning attitude."
중학교 스포츠강사에 대한 구조화 분석,2020,"['Middle school', 'Sports instructor', 'Structure', 'Analysis']",,"The purpose of this study is to present basic data and realistic policy directions for future improvement plans through the survey on the employment and system of school instructors. In order to investigate the perception of the members, I visited the unit school and interviewed the physical education teachers. The interview was conducted for five month in June 2019, and an in-depth interview was conducted with a total of six people. The main issues of regular teachers and school officials derived through in-depth interviews were job security and treatment of instructor occupations. Assessing the ability and quality of instructors to teach students, budgeting for school sports clubs at government level for effective sports club activities, It was suggested to establish various systems for the activation of school sports club activities, such as reflection on career and college entrance.  First, there are major revisions to administrative and policy reinforcement, such as securing the budget, This is a reality where the budget for sports instructors is very low and the population of sports instructors must be increased for better teaching quality. In addition, sports instructors are new jobs created by job creation and are hired as contract workers, which puts them in jeopardy every year. In this situation, sports instructors increase job insecurity and job insecurity, which can affect job satisfaction and quality of instruction. Therefore, a rational improvement plan such as employment stability through the contract of arms and the transition to public service is needed.  Second, institutional support measures include reflecting the career and academic system of sports club activities, and expanding the facilities such as classrooms, equipment, and tools. There are still many students and parents who feel that the major subjects in Korea, English, and Sue are important, and that sports activities are a waste of time. In addition, sports club activities are receiving more enthusiasm because they have no experience in school records. For this reason, awards and participation events through sports club activities should remain in the history and be reflected in the career and college system, and should be introduced in the university entrance system. In addition, school sports activities are conducted at the same time and in the same place as other sports, which affects the class a lot. In addition, as the number of students per sports instructor is large, there is a lack of equipment and class tools necessary for the class, so some students are waiting and some students are participating. Therefore, the expansion of facilities, such as separate places and lacking teaching equipment and tools, should be improved for each event.  Third, there are ways to improve the instructor""s work, such as their own teaching methods, curriculum planning, and reinforcement of their leadership capacity through training activities. Sports instructors are expected to teach various sports and develop sports club activities so that students can participate with interest. To do this, you need to create your own teaching methods and course plans so that students can experience a variety of sports activities. In addition, various trainings are underway to revitalize school sports and strengthen leadership skills. Through these trainings, students will have to learn their teaching techniques and instructional know-how to strengthen their competences and make quality lessons."

He tried to be a symbol of hope and a fortress for his people against difficulties through abolishing mines, even before he reached Yeongheung, as well as endeavoring to improve people’s lives under the threat of various disastrous accidents.Second, ‘the tightening of discipline among his people’ and ‘the reinforcement of national defense’. He tried to manage to maintain Yeongheung, birthplace of the dynasty and a key stronghold of the country, as a province which held prosperity and martial arts in high regard.Third, ‘the encouraging of Confucian spirits and cultural education’. Su-dang transformed negative perception of the Gwanbuk area, the northeastern part of Korea’ into new positive symbol of hope and expectation.He tried to overcome the difficulties of those days by supporting the spirit of Confucian scholars and boosting education and culture.Fourth, ‘dissenting from ‘queen expulsion order’ and then voluntary resignation‘.After the ‘Eulmi Incident’, Su-dang urged the government to take their revenge on Japan. And he also dissented from ‘queen expulsion order’. But his opinion was not accepted. Then, he resigned from governor and went back to his hometown.In the face of many chaotic accidents in Gabo and Eulmi years, Su-dang clearly defined himself as a Confucianist and lived up to his faith derived from learning Confucianism.His firm faith and behavior in life—sense of honor, independent attitude, confrontation with his duty instead of avoiding it—really mean a lot to us today."

The results of a survey of students enrolled in the five major universities of science and technology in Korea show that freshmen evaluated the educational effects of online classes lower than senior students, and most freshmen took online classes in an isolated environment. As a result, freshmen suffered from more difficulties such as having no friends to give and receive help with assignments, and network connection problems. In terms of opportunities to solve questions, concentration on the class, and motivation for learning, freshmen showed lower evaluation than senior students. In the case of real-time online classes, freshmen showed a higher desire for communication and interaction, but the actual class management did not satisfy this desire, leading to their lower concentration on the class. Regarding recorded lectures, freshmen gave lower evaluations in the quality and quantity of recorded lectures, opportunities to solve questions, the possibility of easy preparation and review, and class concentration. As a result, freshmen were less likely to recommend online classes and less willing to take them. It was also revealed that in daily life during the online semester, freshmen were relatively inexperienced in terms of self-management and productive use of time. These findings suggest that designing classes in a way that is active in communication and interaction, and reinforcing the socialization and social capital cultivation functions of schools are essential to not only improve online lectures but also persuade the significance of going to school."
An Investigation of the Effect of Self-correction on Error and Syntactic Complexity of Korean Adults' English Writing,2020,"['self-correction', 'essay', 'Korean adults', 'English grammar']",,"The present study was designed and conducted for the purpose of investigating the effect of self-correction on Korean adults’ writing in terms of error and syntactic complexity. Data analyses showed that there was statistically significant difference between the total numbers of the errors from the pretest and the posttest. Furthermore, all the error types present in Korean adults’ essays witnessed a reduction after fourteen weeks of self-correction. In addition, it should be worth the effort to note that the most frequent error type, Awkward expression accounted for more than half of a total number of errors. Unlike the positive role of self-correction on writing, there was no significant effect of self-correction on syntactic complexity. As a result, error analysis needs to be practiced in the classroom for comprehending error types which students make and designing teaching materials for strategies of having their pupils reduce errors in writing. Furthermore, it is highly recommended that learning and teaching of sentence-level writing along with grammar be reinforced in the classroom since without these students are prone to failing to improve the quality of their English writing."

This study also suggests a theoretical framework of mathematics teachers’ambivalence over the online-training system by axial coding and selective coding.As a result of analyzing these data, some key implications have been drawn. They are as follows.First, mathematics teachers have negative feelings towards an online-training system in that there is a lack of math-related courses offered, a short period for taking courses, the active communication system and the difficulty of applying it into in-service school settings.Second, some mathematic teachers feel positive about the online educational training in terms of easy access, its effectiveness as lectures and the convenient downloading of study materials.Third, the learning experiences of Mathematics teachers have significant influences on their subsequent lecture choices.Based on these findings, the study presents a direction in which future remote training should move forward and suggests policy implications for educational policies to reinforce an online-training system at the same time."

At the present time, almost all of rainwater pumping stations employ pumping policies based on the simple rules depending only on the water level of reservoir. The ongoing climate change caused by global warming makes it increasingly difficult to predict the amount of rainfall. Therefore, it is difficult to cope with changes in the water level of reservoirs through the simple pumping policy. In this paper, we propose a pump operating method based on deep reinforcement learning which has the ability to select the appropriate number of operating pumps to keep the reservoir to the proper water level using the information of the amount of rainfall, the water volume and current water level of the reservoir. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the simulations are performed using Storm Water Management Model(SWMM), a dynamic rainfall-runoff-routing simulation model, and the performance of the method is compared with that of a pumping policy being in use in the field."

Then, by comparing the curriculum of the two countries and exploring cases in connection with creative experience activities and music subjects during the free grade, implications were drawn. During the free school year, the connection between experiential activities and subject-learning content has been reinforced, so that opportunities for students to find their own aptitudes and careers have been further expanded and sustained. It is expected to bloom as the arts ability of the people continues to improve in the lifelong education level."

For this purpose, a 3-dimensional narrative exploration of temporality spatiality, and sociality was conducted concerning the care experience by sampling 2 subjects who had more than 5 years of experience at the care sites. According to the study results, the meaning of care activities by child care carers has been derived as 2 themes of becoming a child care carer and living as a child care carer along with 5 features. First, during the beginning period of less than 3 years in the experience of care activity, the carers have lived in anger and conflicts due to the difficulty in the tasks for practice of care and the different care methods from the parents, and been becoming a child care carer while overcoming through preparing for class materials, accommodating information, and using their own methods of utilizing media & books. Secondly, beyond 3 years in the care activity career, they have lived a life of continued linkage with children’s families and of solving problems with their colleagues, through which they were coming to self-awareness on the children’s growth and accommodation of their colleagues. In addition, they have continued learning using diversified methods, and lived as child care carers while cultivating expertise. Based on these observations, it has been suggested in this study to reinforce the site practice system for the child care carers, to support the colleague culture, and to secure the improvement opportunities for expertise."

The 2015 revised curriculum emphasizes key competencies education throughout the entire school education process, but it is difficult to find assessment tools that can adequately measure key competencies as well as the theoretical basis that can explain the development of students  key competencies. Since cross-curricular key competencies are related to both cognitive domain and affective domain, it is difficult to obtain valid results only with selected-response or paper-pencil tests that have widely been used to measure students’ content knowledge. In addition, it is not easy for teachers to teach and assess cross-curricular key competencies in the context of subject-centered classroom instruction. Despite the theoretical and practical difficulties of assessing key competencies, there is a need to support teachers to maintain the large direction of assessing cross-curricular key competencies in subject-centered classroom instruction. To this end, strategies and assessments to measure problem solving, communication, collaboration, creativity, collaborative problem solving, and critical thinking, which are frequently mentioned as cross-curricular key competencies, were investigated. And strategies to measure both content knowledge and cross-curricular key competencies were explored. In addition, this study suggested methods that appropriately assess cross-curricular key competencies in the context of subject-centered classroom instruction and use assessment results to reinforce teaching and learning the key competencies."

This study examines how overseas R&D subsidiaries allow their headquarters to source local knowledge from the host country in an efficient way. The study also investigates the effect on overseas knowledge sourcing which derives from the external embeddedness of an overseas R&D subsidiary in the local network of the host country upon experiencing the alliance with local entities. In addition, the degree of knowledge digestibility that each headquarters retains as a condition by which host country knowledge sourcing of headquarters can be effectively facilitated by the host country R&D subsidiary is also investigated. The study tests the hypotheses established with the data of geographical distribution of overseas R&D subsidiaries of 162 multinationals which were included on the Fortune 500 MNC list in the year 2008 and the patent data of each firm along with the alliance and financial data. The study provides empirical evidence that the headquarters can benefit from the existence of a R&D subsidiary when it exists in a host country with abundant knowledge. Moreover, the findings suggest that the headquarters having a degree of knowledge digestibility will reinforce the role of host country R&D subsidiary on host country knowledge acquisition, learning, and innovation of the headquarters."

A total of 339 participants were allocated to two experimental groups (Group 1 and Group 2) and one control group.[Findings] Findings from the experiment showed that Group 1 and Group 2 are less inclined toward unethical behavior than the control group. Between Group 1 and Group 2, Group 1 that went through the reflection phase shows much less inclination toward unethical behavior than Group 2. The results further indicated that the impact of ethics training gradually diminished over time, but having reflection was found to help sustain the training impact.[Implications] Along with its theoretical contribution that sheds light on the role of reflection in ethics training programs, this study may be worthwhile by providing companies with practical implications that reinforce the effectiveness of ethics training."

In the review, the main targets were the testimony of the victims of the atomic bomb, and the memorial ceremony of the atomic bomb week. Through the review, this article explained that the identity of victims in Japan is formed by sharing the emotion of pain  and emotional language of pain of the victims of the atomic bomb. That process was a reminder of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the past, and at the same time forgetting the fact of Japan's war responsibility and the assaults of colonial rule. The Japanese identity of the victims showed a duality that enables a solidarity of transnational  peace based on the sociality of pain and moral sentiment, along with the oblivion of responsibility of war. However, more than 70 years after the war, the emotion of pain inscribed on the body due to the aging and death of the atomic bomb victims gradually disappeared, and as the postwar generation who had no experience of war became the mainstream of society, the moral sentiment declined. The transnational solidarity of the peace was weakened. Amidst the social unrest caused by the collapse of the Cold War and the bubble economy, Japanese society has entered the era of memory from the experience of the atomic bombing, and the task of how the generation without experience will inherit the memory of the atomic bombing has emerged. Japan focuses on decontextualization and tragedy in the verbal practice of the atomic bombing, and reinforces victimization through learning of emotions of pain. With the aim of gathering war victims, the damages of the Tokyo Air Raids and the Okinawa War, which were forgotten, are newly called as Japanese war damages."

At present, the importance of arts education in school is recognized in Korea to reinforce the capacity of creative convergence for future talents, and the necessity of producing contents in the art field that meets the intention of implementing the free semester system is raised. At this point, the development of a dance education program combined with media is timely, and its purpose is to allow students to directly experience and understand the world of convergence through dance education combined with media. This allows students to identify their own aptitudes and explore different careers. As a result of applying the program to the class in middle school, it was possible to motivate them by watching the video related to the class and to arouse their interest in order to make them participate in the class more actively, by using the video and various props to maximize the effect of teaching. In addition, it was found that in the process of presenting creative dance by group, it helped to learn cooperation and empathy among members and helped to improve confidence and achievement. Although there are not many cases of convergence education program of dance that fit the purpose of the free semester, this study is expected to be used as basic data for more systematic follow-up studies."

VIII and IX, Aristotle discusses various kinds of cognitive behavior of animals, such as survival tactics, rearing of the young, learning, and communication. Among them, there are also animal behaviors that are referred to as phronima, i.e. as behaviors based on phronēsis. However, a deeper understanding of these animal cognitive behaviors involves a more complex issue. This is  because, as Aristotle famously stated in the EN, phronēsis is an acquired ability to deliberate well, and no other animals except humans are capable of deliberation. So, what does it mean when Aristotle attributes phronima to nonhuman animals that cannot deliberate and choose? This article attempts to answer this question, by examining some relevant statements in Hist. an. I X and other works of A ristotle. My discussion consists of three phases. First, I identify the passages in the Hist. an., which deals with the animal phronima, and analyze the specific types of animals and their behavioral patterns Aristotle recognizes as phronēsis (Section 2). Then, after confirming that the phronēsis of animals is divided into the two types, ‘innate’ and ‘acquired’, I detail the limitations of animal phronēsis in comparison to human phronēsis (Section 3). Finally, by analyzing in detail the phronima of deer presented in Hist. an. IX, 5, I demonstrate the nature of the cognitive explanations regarding animal phronēsis Aristotle offers (Section 4). Based on these analyses, I conclude that the phronēsis of nonhuman animals has little to do with deliberation; rather, it stems from the innate power of foresight, which can be reinforced through memory or experience."

The rulers of the middle period tried to raise their ancestral shrine to the rank of the whole-state ritual. As a result, its managing system was transformed based on Chinese Confucian shrine-system during the ruling time of King Shinmoon. But the new system did not settle at once. This is because the Kings performed the ceremony of accession to the throne in the holy palace and did worship ceremony only in specific ancestral chamber of the royal shrine at that time.  A systematic operation of the Confucian shrine-system started after the establishment of Five-shrine during the ruling period of King Hyegong. To raise it to the rank of the whole-state ritual, the ancestor placed at the top place of the royal shrine was changed from Seonghan to King Michoo. Also, since King Muyeol and King Moonmu were regarded as the center of the middle period’s royal family and as their direct ancestors, their tablets were enshrined, which was a special treatment.  After this, the importance of royal shrine and its rite was reinforced further, eventually becoming a ritual that represents Silla. Yet considerable importance was still attached to the holy palace and to its ritual. Thus, we can learn that a new trend of system was settled gradually in the state’s rite of Silla dynasty, while coexisting with the existing ritual."

The development of qualitative education through free communication and discussion culture. Creating a space for smooth communication and play, rather than a knowledge transfer factory or a bloody battlefield, begins with the establishment of a democratic educational environment. The detailed proposal is as follows. First, expansion of the area of ​​school autonomy is essential. It is necessary to create a self-governing organization with teachers and students or parents and related experts, if necessary, to run an organization that discusses and discusses not only the school's administrative problems but also the entire school calendar and content. Second, it is necessary to make a regular program of education or re-education that will challenge teachers and students. In particular, intensive education programs such as lectures, seminars, and discussions by third-party experts are required to resolve the situation in which the generational gaps and viewpoint differences between teachers and students cannot be overcome. Third, we feel the necessity of creating textbooks and educational programs to teach and train democratic educational principles and values. Fourth, the core values ​​pursued by democratic civic education will be education that enlightens and trains the current school situation, which is not only knowledge and information transfer education.

The findings show that the major characteristics of humanities programs on TV included succinct summaries and answers, lectures based on showing and performance, knowledge with bleached questions and critical perspectives, pursuit of broad and shallow knowledge, and a smooth introduction, development, turn, and conclusion. They were converted into some sort of sign values in humanities and supplied to viewers. Humanistic thinking is to share coded knowledge in the popular forms of summaries, commentaries, and explanations. They represented images coded socially and culturally, including the basis of creativity required from modern society, meanings as cultural assets to create a competitive edge, images of culture to symbolize an affluent and leisurely life, foundation of knowledge to acquire with a deficiency of capabilities, and images of information to be acquired easily and rapidly and consumed quickly. The patterns of their popular acceptance include easy and proper instant consumption; rest with humanities without purpose, a means to fulfill intellectual vanity, and consumption of celebrities  brand value, which were in common use as certain semantic systems. In this context, the consumption of humanities tended not to go further than the dimension of intellectual accessories, such as intellectual satisfaction and rest, healing, and tools of self-development. They seem to select what they will consume independently, but the truth is that they seek after hierarchical codes of the same sign systems and values around the objects of consumption. As a consequence, their isolation gets reinforced even more. Based on these findings, the study discussed the relationship of culture and education in the context of lifelong learning and set their meanings and values."

세대 간 소통을 위한 <구술생애담 공유 프로그램> 운영 사례 연구 - 노년 세대와 청소년 세대를 중심으로 -,2020,"['구술생애담 공유 프로그램', '청소년 세대', '노인 세대', '세대 소통', '구술생애담', '마을공동체', 'oral life stories', 'youth generation', 'elderly generation', 'intergenerational communication', 'sharing life stories', 'village community']","이 글은 세대 간 구술생애담 공유 프로그램 운영의 실제이다. 세대 간 구술생애담 공유 프로그램은 노인 세대의 구술생애담을 통해 세대 간에 역사·문화적 경험을 공유하게 하고 고독한 노인 세대와 주변에 무관심한 청소년 세대가 정서적 울림을 주고받는 공명을 통하여 두 세대 간의 바람직한 소통과 관계 회복에 기여하고자 개발하였다.세대 간 구술생애담 공유 프로그램은 노년 세대가 한평생 살아온 인생 이야기를 청소년 세대가 경청하고 기록·정리하여 책으로 제작하는 내용으로 구성되어 있다. 단계별 활동은 준비-조사-정리-책 제작 4단계로 구성하였고, 프로그램의 전 과정을 청소년 참가자들이 주도해 나가도록 구성하였다.1단계 준비단계는 청소년 참가자가 구술생애담 이해의 기초, 조사 방법, 질문 기술 학습과 채록 장비를 다루는 기술을 익히는 단계이다.2단계 조사단계는 사전조사-본조사-보강조사 3단계로 세분화된다. 사전조사는 그룹별 노년 세대 제보자와 청소년 세대 청소년 참가자의 첫 만남이 이루어지는 단계이다. 본조사는 제보자 중심으로 진행되는 단계로 제보자 스스로가 정리한 생애담을 구체적으로 구술하고, 청소년 참가자는 제보자의 구술 내용과 이야기판 현장을 꼼꼼하고 생생하게 기록하는 단계이다. 보강조사는 제보자가 소장한 사진을 활용하여 구술 내용을 보강해 나가는 단계이다.3단계 정리단계는 청소년 참가자가 전사 매뉴얼에 따라 윤색 없이 제보자 구술 내용 그대로 기록하고 검수를 거쳐 수정 보완하는 단계이다.4단계는 책 제작단계이다. 참가자들이 책 출판의 전 과정을 체험할 수 있도록 구성하였다. 정리단계에서 전사한 자료를 본문 원고로 삼고, 제보자 소개글 작성, 본문 삽화 그리기, 속표지(title page) 삽화 그리기, 참가자 캐리커처(자화상) 그리기, 활동 후기 작성 활동을 수행한다.세대 간 구술생애담 공유 프로그램의 실행 결과 정서적 측면, 사회적 측면, 교육적 측면에서 성과를 거두었다. 정서적 측면에서 청소년 세대는 노년 세대의 구술생애담 공유 프로그램의 전 과정 참가를 통해 세대 간 활발한 정서적 교감과 소통을 이루었고, 마을공동체에 대한 관심으로 이어졌다. 그리고 노년 세대는 청소년 세대와의 소통으로 삶의 활력소를 얻었다고 평가하였고, 자기 존중감이 향상되었다. 사회적 측면에서는 청소년 세대의 노인 세대에 관한 편견과 인식 개선의 변화가 나타났다. 교육적 측면에서는 청소년 세대가 사실적 역사교육은 물론 책에서는 배울 수 없는 이전 세대가 전하는 삶의 지혜를 내면화하는 인성교육, 그리고 기록연구사(archivist), 출판 관련, 미디어 관련 직업교육까지 체득하는 여러 방면의 교육적 성과도 이루었다. 그런데 이 프로그램 역시 여느 프로그램과 마찬가지로 프로그램이 끝난 이후 지속적인 활동이 이루어지지 못한 채 일회성에 그치고 마는 한계를 지닌다. 따라서 세대 간의 소통을 위한 프로그램의 지속적인 후속 활동의 고민이 필요하다.","This study is about the implementation of a program sharing oral life stories between generations. The program allows youth to share in historical and cultural experiences by listening to the elderly generation’s oral life stories. Moreover, this program is intended to improve communication and restore the relationship between the two generations through the emotional resonance of the lonely elderly and the youth indifferent to the world around them.The program requires the youth to produce a book after listening, recording, and organizing the elderly’s life stories. The activities consist of four stages: preparation, investigation, organization, and book making. The entire program is led by youth participants.In the first stage, the youth participants learn about the basics of oral life stories, investigation methods, questioning techniques, and dealing with recording equipment.The second, investigation stage, is divided into three phases: preliminary investigation, main investigation, and supplementary investigation. The preliminary investigation is where the first meeting of the elderly informants and the youth participants occurs. The main investigation centers on the informants, with them telling their life stories. The youth participants meticulously and vividly record this oral content. Supplementary investigation is the reinforcement of the oral life stories through photos.Stage 3 of the organization involves the youth participants recording the oral contents in accordance with the copy manual, having it inspected, and revising and supplementing it.Stage 4 is the book making part, formed to ensure that youth participants can experience the entire process of book publishing. The youth participants produce a manuscript of the main text using copied data in the organization stage, and they perform activities such as writing an introduction about the informants, drawing illustrations, making a title page, and participants’ caricature, and giving a review of the activity.As a result of the program, participants were able to achieve the desired emotional, social, and educational goals. Regarding the emotional aspect, the youth achieved active emotional connections and communication with the elderly, which led to their interest in the village community. The elderly generation evaluated that they gained vitality in their lives through communication with the youth, and their self-esteem also improved. From a social perspective, it improved the youths’ prejudices and perceptions about the elderly generation. In terms of education, not only were the youth able to acquire factual history, but they also acquired personality education that internalizes the wisdom of life conveyed by previous generations that cannot be learned in books, and vocational education related to archivists, publishing, and media.The limitation of the program is thst no continuous follow-up activities were conducted after the end of the program. It is worth considering follow-up activities for better communication between generations."
