Approximate k values using Repulsive Force without Domain Knowledge in k-means,2020,"['Clustering', 'k-means algorithm', 'machine learning', 'repulsive force']",,"The k-means algorithm is widely used in academia and industry due to easy and simple implementation, enabling fast learning for complex datasets. However, k-means struggles to classify datasets without prior knowledge of specific domains. We proposed the repulsive k-means (RK-means) algorithm in a previous study to improve the k-means algorithm, using the repulsive force concept, which allows deleting unnecessary cluster centroids. Accordingly, the RK-means enables to classifying of a dataset without domain knowledge. However, three main problems remain. The RK-means algorithm includes a cluster repulsive force offset, for clusters confined in other clusters, which can cause cluster locking; we were unable to prove RK-means provided optimal convergence in the previous study; and RK-means shown better performance only normalize term and weight. Therefore, this paper proposes the advanced RK-means (ARK-means) algorithm to resolve the RK-means problems. We establish an initialization strategy for deploying cluster centroids and define a metric for the ARK-means algorithm. Finally, we redefine the mass and normalize terms to close to the general dataset. We show ARK-means feasibility experimentally using blob and iris datasets. Experiment results verify the proposed ARK-means algorithm provides better performance than k-means, k’-means, and RK-means."

The purpose of this paper is to generate temporal travel patterns of public transportation trips by using smart card data of several days at user level. We present a methodology for generating temporal travel profiles of passengers from smart card data of several consecutive days. The methodology generates multiple travel patterns by clustering passengers with similar travel profiles by k-means method.The results of applying the developed methodology to 38-day smart card data of Daejeon Metropolitan City are presented.It was confirmed that eight temporal travel patterns were finally generated by repetitive clustering, and the analysis results were compared with the results by user class information included in the smart card data."
Adaptive k-means clustering for Flying Ad-hoc Networks,2020,"['Energy optimization', 'Clustering', 'FANET', 'k-means', 'Routing', 'Transmission range optimization']",,"Flying ad-hoc networks (FANETs) is a vibrant research area nowadays. This type of network ranges from various military and civilian applications. FANET is formed by micro and macro UAVs. Among many other problems, there are two main issues in FANET. Limited energy and high mobility of FANET nodes effect the flight time and routing directly. Clustering is a remedy to handle these types of problems. In this paper, an efficient clustering technique is proposed to handle routing and energy problems. Transmission range of FANET nodes is dynamically tuned accordingly as per their operational requirement. By optimizing the transmission range packet loss ratio (PLR) is minimized and link quality is improved which leads towards reduced energy consumption. To elect optimal cluster heads (CHs) based on their fitness we use k-means. Selection of optimal CHs reduce the routing overhead and improves energy consumption. Our proposed scheme outclasses the existing state-of-the-art techniques, ACO based CACONET and PSO based CLPSO, in terms of energy consumption and cluster building time."
4 방향 윤곽선 추적과 K-Means 알고리즘을 이용한 색조 도플러 초음파 영상에서 상환 동맥의 혈류 영역 추출,2020,,,"In this paper, we propose a method of extraction analysis of blood flow area on color doppler ultrasonography by using 4-directional contour tracking and K-Means algorithm. In the proposed method, ROI is extracted and a binarization method with maximum contrast as a threshold is applied to the extracted ROI. 4-directional contour algorithm is applied to extract the trapezoid shaped region which has blood flow area of brachial artery from the binarized ROI. K-Means based quantization is then applied to accurately extract the blood flow area of brachial artery from the trapezoid shaped region. In experiment, the proposed method successfully extracts the target area in 28 out of 30 cases (93.3%) with field expert's verification. And comparison analysis of proposed K-Means based blood flow area extraction on 30 color doppler ultrasonography and brachial artery blood flow ultrasonography provided by a specialist yielded a result of 94.27% accuracy on average."
Improved K-means Clustering Algorithm based on Dynamic Clustering,2020,"['Cluster Analysis', 'K-means', 'Dynamic Clustering', 'Data Mining']",,"Cluster analysis can find not only potential and valuable structured information in the data set, but also provide pre-processing functions for other data mining algorithms, and then can refine the processing results to improve the accuracy of the algorithm. Therefore, cluster analysis has become one of the hot research topics in the field of data mining. K-means algorithm, as a clustering algorithm based on the partitioning idea, can compare the differences between the data set classes and classes. We can use the K-means algorithm to mine the clustering results and further discover the potentially valuable knowledge in the data set. Help people make more accurate decisions. This paper summarizes and analyzes the traditional K-means algorithm, summarizes the improvement direction of the K-means algorithm, fully considers the dynamic change of information in the K-means clustering process, and reduces the standard setting value for the termination condition of the algorithm to reduce The number of iterations of the algorithm reduces the learning time; the redundant information generated by the dynamic change of information is deleted to reduce the interference in the dynamic clustering process, so that the algorithm achieves a more accurate and efficient clustering effect. Experimental results show that when the amount of data is large, compared with the traditional K-means algorithm, the improved K-means algorithm has a greater improvement in accuracy and execution efficiency."
K-Means와 CNN을 이용한 변화된 환경에서의 전동기 고장 진단,2020,"['deep learning', 'K-means', 'CNN', 'diagnosis']",,"The most commonly used data for diagnosing the mechanical failure of a motor is vibration data. This vibration data is also used to diagnose motor failures in machine learning. However, there are many types of electric motors used in the industry, and the environment can vary according to the proposed use. To diagnose motor failure, data must be collected, labeled, and learned. In this way, it is very difficult to collect and label vibration data in consideration of all situations. For example, in identical situations, even if only the sensor changes, the CNN-only algorithm can fail to classify the data. In this paper, a method of learning CNN with learning data created by automatically classifying and labeling data using K-means is proposed. To apply K-means to fault diagnosis, FFT data was divided by frequency. For each frequency, the K-means algorithm was applied to calculate the centroid. The training data was used to calculate the similarity and distance to the centroid of the classified clusters. Using the calculated results, the centroid classified as the K-means was reclassified as normal or fault. This method using the K-menas could classify data, even if various data were entered. Finally, CNN was trained using the generated training data. Using this process, the existing CNN-only algorithm failed to classify the data when the sensor was altered, but the proposed algorithm classified the data and showed high accuracy."
"Evaluation Index for Sporty Engine Sound Reflecting Evaluators’ Tastes, Developed Using K-means Cluster Analysis",2020,"['K-means clustering', 'Multiple linear regression', 'Psychoacoustic', 'Sound quality index', 'Sportiness', 'Vehicle engine sound']",,"Developments in vehicle technology and accompanying improvements in NVH performance have led to increased consumer demand for high sound quality, such as a “sporty” engine sound. As sporty sound is subjective, this study sought to express its meaning quantitatively and to develop a model that accommodates the differences in individuals’ tastes. Engine sounds of four vehicles at wide-open throttle were recorded and the signal was modulated via filtering. Acoustic and psychoacoustic parameters of the samples produced were calculated, and the preferences for sportiness were identified through jury testing. Using K-means clustering, factor analysis, and multiple linear regression, a sound quality index and a model reflecting differences in evaluators’ tastes were developed. The index was retested using new evaluators and new samples, demonstrating its reliability by high correlation. This sound quality evaluation index is useful for producing highly accurate results and reflecting the opinions of groups expressing a variety of commonalities."

Excessive berthing velocity may cause accidents in ports and ships, so it is necessary to be cautious. Since the ship’s berthing is completed by the pilot on board, the propensity of the pilots is closely related to the decision of the berthing velocity. Therefore, this study the pattern of pilot s maneuvering to berth the ship to prevent berthing accidents was analyzed by clustering. K-means algorithm was used as a clustering analysis method as one of the unsupervised learning of machine learning. The berthing velocity data were collected for the pilot cluster analysis, the data were collected for 39 months at a domestic tanker jetty. During the collection period, 47 pilots were surveyed who boarded the ship that berthed at the jetty. The 47 pilots were grouped by individual and analyzed basic data including the average and standard deviation of the berthing velocity. Based on the analyzed mean and standard deviation, the k-means algorithm was applied for the clustering of pilots. As a result, the pilots were clustered into four groups. Groups with low mean and standard deviation, medium mean but low standard deviation, groups with medium mean and standard deviation, and finally, group with relatively high mean and standard deviation. Based on the four groups, the pilots were divided into three patterns of maneuvering: Low, Moderate, and High Risk."

The feedback environment is a contextual aspect of the feedback process and the feedback-oriented culture influences considerably the learner's acceptance of feedback and whether they reflect this in their behavior.Nevertheless, there are few research related to the effects of the feedback environment in the classroom assessment of Korea. Therefore, in this study, we utilized the Feedback Environment Scale for Students(Steelman et al., 2004), and validated it for use with elementary, middle, and high school students in Korea. We also investigated construct equivalence of this scale across the school levels. For this study, reliability analysis, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), correlation analysis, and multi-Group CFA were applied to check the psychometric properties of the K-FESS. First, the K-FESS with 23 items was accepted that only one item had been excluded from the original version through translation and content validation procedure. Second, the five-factor solution was produced by CFA and it exhibited good reliability and validity. Third, the construct equivalence of the K-FESS across the school levels was confirmed. This means that the K-FESS can be used as a common scale for all school levels. Fourth, the latent mean analyses revealed that the elementary school students had significantly higher feedback environment perceptions than those in other school levels. However the latent mean differences between middle and high school students were inconsistent across the subscales. Finally, implications for the applied use of the K-FESS in Korea are discussed."

The physiognomy was an objective and practical tool to read the ability and possibility of the other party using the face as a text in our traditional culture. Reading the information on the faces through the physiognomy was also a means of enhancing communication with others and understanding the opponents. The physiognomy analysis of Korean faces can be cultural literacy in this context.This study was based on the faces of “Beyond The Scene (BTS),” which is popular worldwide with outstanding talent in performance and singing. They had the genetic traits of the Korean people who could become world-class stars and their unique genetic traits passed on to the faces of Korea were analyzed through physiognomy. Most of the human genetic traits are determined by biological genetics and are not easily changed. As there are differences in personal appearance, ability, and taste, individuality exists according to differences in ethnic traits. The BTS is the most successful Korean wave content in recent years. The effect of BTS has already attracted attention as an object of academic research, beyond the phenomenon of pop-culture. The potential traits of Korean people were mediated by the physiognomy of BTS and analyzed as possible cultural content.Based on this, the present study examined the aspect of cultural literacy inherent in Koreans as cultural content in the 21st century. Therefore, the study aimed to understand physiognomy as cultural literacy in modern times by examining the physical characteristics of genetic traits of “BTS” as successful cultural content from a physiognomical point of view.The members of BTS have a harmonious nose and cheekbone, and the eyebrows are good; therefore, their communication with fans using media has a positive effect. Their five sense organs are good in terms of physiognomy. Their faces are clear and they look like precious children. The skin of all members is smooth and clean. Their eyebrows are especially good. They are not too dark and they are arranged neatly and located high above the eyes. If people’s eyebrows are cool like this, they are popular with the public. The BTS is composed of great members who are musically good at composing songs, members who have excellent singing skills, and members who are excellent at dancing. Although there is a lack of individual physiognomic characteristics, when the members of BTS are together, they complement each other to make it more popular.This study recognizes that the accumulated method of reading faces according to socio-cultural conditions is a part of traditional culture as a cultural context.Furthermore, physiognomical reading can be cultural literacy that reads culture.This also means that the unique genetic traits on the face can be understood as a cultural text."
제조업의 인적오류 관련 사고분석을 위한 HFACS-K의 개발 및 사례연구,2020,"['HFACS', 'HFACS-K', 'accident analysis', 'acident investigation', 'human error']",,"As Korean government and safety-related organizations make continuous efforts to reduce the number of industrial accidents, accident rate has steadily declined since 2010, thereby recording 0.48% in 2017. However, the number of fatalities due to industrial accidents was 1,987 in 2017, which means that more efforts should be made to reduce the number of industrial accidents. As an essential activity for enhancing the system safety, accident analysis can be effectively used for reducing the number of industrial accidents. Accident analysis aims to understand the process of an accident scenario and to identify the plausible causes of the accident. Accident analysis offers useful information for developing measures for preventing the recurrence of an accident or its similar accidents. However, it seems that the current practice of accident analysis in Korean manufacturing companies takes a simplistic accident model, which is based on a linear and deterministic cause-effect relation. Considering the actual complexities underlying accidents, this would be problematic; it could be more significant in the case of human error-related accidents. Accordingly, it is necessary to use a more elaborated accident model for addressing the complexity and nature of human-error related accidents more systematically. Regarding this, HFACS(Human Factors Analysis and Classification System) can be a viable accident analysis method. It is based on the Swiss cheese model and offers a range of causal factors of a human error-related accident, some of which can be judged as the plausible causes of an accident. HFACS has been widely used in several work domains(e.g. aviation and rail industry) and can be effectively used in Korean industries. However, as HFACS was originally developed in aviation industry, the taxonomy of causal factors may not be easily applied to accidents in Korean industries, particularly manufacturing companies. In addition, the typical characteristics of Korean industries need to be reflected as well. With this issue in mind, we developed HFACS-K as a method for analyzing accidents happening in Korean industries. This paper reports the process of developing HFACS-K, the structure and contents of HFACS-K, and a case study for demonstrating its usefulness."
Placement of Charging Infrastructures for EVs using K-Mean Algorithm and its Validation using Real Usage Data,2020,['Electric vehicle · Charging infrastructure · Charging station · Eco-friendly vehicle · Jeju island'],,"Global climate change is affecting human life more seriously than ever before. Countries around the world have identified cars as a significant source of pollution, leading to an increased interest in eco-friendly automobiles. Electric vehicles (EVs), which are characteristically eco-friendly, have become a choice for future transportation system. In this paper, we proposed a strategy for determining the appropriate placement of large-scale charging stations using K-mean algorithm. Also, the initial results were validated utilizing actual electricity usage data from the existing chargers. Currently in Korea, a typical public charging station has two to three chargers to support EV users. As EVs become more popular, new problems arise, such as charger hopping and/or long waiting lines. In order to address these new issues, a large-scale charging station concept which houses more than ten chargers, is suggested. In doing so, a strategic approach for selecting close-to-ideal locations for the charging stations is introduced to maximize the charging station’s effectiveness. In this study, Jeju Island, Korea, which has many EVs, was used as a testbed. With the wealth of EV chargers and their usage data, initial validation of the proposed methodology was made possible. During the evaluation of the best possible locations for the largescale charging stations, we considered the locations of tourist attractions and convenient support facilities, as well as the population. After the evaluations, the proposed locations were validated using actual long-term charger usage data on Jeju Island. The demonstrated strategy for identifying appropriate locations for large-scale charging stations can be used by other tourist heavy islands or even small countries."

Specifically, we have verified that the introduction of K－IFRS has changed the level of discretionary recognition of deferred corporate tax assets by managers as the recognition criteria for the feasibility of deferred corporate tax assets have been eased. We also verified whether the introduction of K－IFRS would allow managers to use discretionary recognition on the feasibility of deferred corporate tax assets as a means of earnings management. The research sample is the year of 3,089 non－financial firms that were listed on the Korea Stock Exchange in December from 2008 to 2016.  The empirical analysis results are as follows. First, it was shown that the managers’ discretionary recognition level on the feasibility of deferred corporate tax assets has increased since the introduction of K－IFRS. Second, since the introduction of K－IFRS, managers’ discretionary recognition level on the feasibility of deferred corporate tax assets has been utilized in earnings management for the purpose of avoiding earing reduction compared to the prior year. Further analysis also showed that since the introduction of K－IFRS, managers’ discretionary recognition level on the feasibility of deferred tax corporate assets has been utilized in earnings management for income smoothing purposes. Therefore, this study suggest that discretionary recognition criteria for the feasibility of deferred corporate tax assets that have been relieved since the introduction of K－IFRS are likely to be used as a means of earnings management. Therefore, it is deemed necessary to respond to this by the government authorities and to pay attention to participants in the capital market.  This study is expected to provide useful information, both policy and practice according to the introduction of K－IFRS, by presenting changes in discretionary recognition of deferred corporate tax assets and the possibility of earnings management utilizing this."

Methods : 58 children with developmental disabilities in the study were collected to determine the aim of this study. K-DST was used as a measurement instrument to verify the validity of developmental screening test for children with developmental disabilities. Cronbach’s Alpha and Confirmatory Factor Analysis were used to identify validity and reliability of K-DST in children with developmental disabilities. Results : The reliability of K-DST in children with developmental disabilities by developmental areas (e.g., gross motor, fine motor, language development) was 0.96-0.98, indicating a significantly high level of reliability. The results of confirmatory factor analysis had higher multicollinearity than .40, which means that they had positive loading of each question in each variable. In addition, there was a significant relationship between gross motor and fine motor development of children with developmental disabilities even though there were no significant relationships between others (e.g., gross motor and language, fine motor and language). In the model fit, the AGFI factor showed a positive model fit, but other factors did not have. Conclusions : Gross motor, fine motor, and language had positive loading of questions in each variable. There was a significant relationship between gross motor and fine motor development of children with developmental disabilities. But there was not a positive model fit in developmental screening test. In follow-up studies it is necessary to verify the validity by using the all the factors of the K-DST."

K. 체스터턴의 변증론을 정리하며 그 함축점을 고찰하는 것이다. 우리는 체스터턴의 변증론에 대한 연구를 귀류법(reductio ad absurdum)이라는 그의 전략에 대한 성찰로부터 시작한다. 다음으로, 체스터턴이 전개하는 역설의 변증학을 고찰한다. 체스터턴에 따르면, 기독교 정통신앙의 핵심은 무미건조한 교리나 무겁고 고정된 실체가 아니며 상반된 열정을 나란히 타오르게 해주는 초인간적인 역설이다. 우리는 역설적 인간 이해의 토대 위에서 광기와 온전한 정신의 차이를 고찰한다. 더 나아가서, 우리는 체스터턴이 우주를 닫혀진 체계로 간주하지 않으며 인간의 역사를 서사적 이야기의 관점에서 접근한다는 것을 강조한다. 서사적 이야기로서 전개되는 우주는 기적의 가능성을 품고 있다. 인간 역사의 최고의 기적은 그리스도의 성육신과 죽음과 부활이며, 그 사건으로 인하여 우리는 하나님의 서사적 이야기 속에서 펼쳐지는 진정한 모험으로 초청을 받는 존재가 된다. 마지막으로, 본 연구는 우리 시대의 변증 전략을 위한 체스터턴의 공헌을 간략히 정리한다","This study examines G. K. Chesterton’s apologetics and traces its implications. We first examine how Chesterton understands his apologetics and how he tries to achieve his goal. The means to achieve his apologetic goal is so-called redcutio ad absurdum. Next, we examine the apologetics of the paradox that Chesterton expands. According to Chesterton, the core of the Christian Orthodox is not a dry dogma or a fixed entity. For Chesterton, Christian orthodoxy is a superhuman paradox whereby two opposite passions may blaze. According to Chesterton, imagination does not breed insanity. On the contrary, reckless emphasis upon reason breeds insanity. The insane person who has lost everything except his reason can not accept a superhuman paradox.  We emphasize that Chesterton does not regard the cosmos as a closed system. Chesterton interprets human history in terms of narrative where genuine miracles can happen. The most wondrous miracle of human history is the incarnation and death and resurrection of Christ. Owing to this miracle, we are invited to the glorious adventure of God. In the concluding section, Chesterton’s contribution to the apologetic strategy of our generation is pointed out briefly."

Nonlocal vibration of carbon/boron-nitride nano-hetero-structure in thermal and magnetic fields by means of nonlinear finite element method,2020,"['hybrid nanotube', 'nonlinear finite element analysis', 'magnetic field', 'nonlocal elasticity', 'thermal environment']",,"Hybrid nanotubes composed of carbon and boron-nitride nanotubes have manifested as innovative building blocks to exploit the exceptional features of both structures simultaneously. On the other hand, by mixing with other types of materials, the fabrication of relatively large nanotubes would be feasible in the case of macroscale applications. In the current article, a nonlinear finite element formulation is employed to deal with the nonlocal vibrational behavior of carbon/boron-nitride nano-hetero-tubes in the presence of magneto-thermal environment. Euler–Bernoulli beam model in conjunction with the Eringen’s nonlocal theory of elasticity is adopted to derive the governing equation of motion. In order to conduct a nonlinear frequency analysis, the von-K´arm´an nonlinearity associated with moderate rotations is also considered. It is well known that temperature gradients can significantly change the dynamic behavior of nanotubes. On the other hand, the coefficients of thermal expansions of carbon and boron-nitride nanotubes are quite different that may affect the structural stability of hybrid nanotubes. Hence, to explore the vibration characteristic of such composite structures, the influence of magneto-thermal environment is also taken into account. Finally, the eigenvalue analysis is performed to exhibit the nonlinear mode shapes and natural frequencies of the system due to initial displacement. It is expected that the recognition of dynamic behavior of such hybrid nanotubes may open the doors to the creative design of next-generation nano-devices."

The existing SF of the K-WAIS-IV (Choi et al, 2014), when used to the subnormal group, overestimated the IQ of the subnormal group because of regression toward mean. Also, the existing SF’s subscales were not enough to measure fluid reasoning (Gf) component. To address these problems, this study suggests three new SFs: SF A, SF B, and SF C. SF A (including VC, AR, MR, and CD) and SF B (VC, AR) were developed based on the confirmation factor analysis (CFA) result of draft examination sample (n=474). SF C (AR, MR), with theoretical and practical reasoning that evaluation of Gf would be useful in draft examination, includes arithmetic reasoning (AR) and matrix reasoning (MR). A multiple regression analysis was performed to derive a regression formula equation to estimate IQ. All three SFs met all validity criteria (Resnick & entin, 1971) with the exception of concordance rate. In an additional study conducted to examine utility of the new SFs as a screening test, SF A showed a very high screening ability. SF B and SF C also showed a decent screening ability. Interestingly, SF C was shown to be better than SF B in selecting out those who need an additional in-depth examination. The ROC results indicated that SF A, SF B, and SF C are all secondary screening test. Finally, implications and limitations of this study as well as suggestions for further research were discussed."

With BTS and its fandom ARMY as a main case study, we try to identify who the feminist fans are and what makes their fan practice critical to K-Pop industry and our society.  Selecting six (former/current) BTS ARMYs who claim themselves as feminist fans, we conducted semi-structured interviews in terms of their feminist fan experience on misogynistic lyrics and controversial attitude of BTS after 2016.  By analyzing the research participants’ narratives of feminist fan practice, we found that “declaring leaving K-Pop fandom” has crucial meaning to feminist fans. Four common experiences have been examined: (1) identifying him/herself as both fan and feminist, (2) practicing feminism in their fandom group, (3) self-conflict between two different identities, (4) (considering leaving or) leaving fandom as a feminist fan statement. We also discovered that they considered “leaving fandom” as the strongest political/public statement as a fan, a K-Pop consumer, as well as a feminist.   While the emergence and practice of feminist fans have its own importance, it obviously did not succeed in expanding its implications to either K-Pop idol scene or Korean feminist movement. It also fails to fracture dominant structural tendency to neglect feminist perspective in K-Pop idol industry or culture which considers human being as a major capital or a product.  Despite these limitations, we argue that exodus of feminist fans from K-Pop fandom allows a critical question to current misogynic K-Pop idol scene, and K-Pop industry in general: “is feminism really unnecessary to K-Pop idol scene?”  We expect this study to bring attention to changes in K-pop and its fandom under the growing influence of feminism. Furthermore, it can shed new light on how the relation between Korean popular culture and Korean feminist public will evolve."

K/DA는 게임 캐릭터와 아이돌 걸그룹의 캐릭터 데이터베이스를 기반으로 생성됐다. 이때 가상의 아이돌 캐릭터와 실제의 여성 아이돌이 결합해 독자적 정체성을 구축한다. 이후 모션 캡처를 통해 가상화된 인물의 신체를 체화하고, 증강현실을 통해 무대에서 퍼포먼스를 구축한다. 그 결과 K/DA는 가상과 현실을 가로지르는 동시에, 둘 중 어디에도 귀속되지 않는 파타피지컬 주체가 된다. 이처럼 K/DA는 가상/현실, 정보/물질, 기계/인간을 구분했던 이분법적 체계를 극복하고, 향후 디지털 주체가 위치할 제3의 지대를 제시했다는 점에서 그 의의가 있다.","K/DA is a K-pop virtual idol based on the 〈League of Legends〉 game character. This study analyzed the creation process, characteristics and existential meaning of virtual idols from the perspective of Pataphysics. K/DA is a character with both characteristics of game character and K-pop girl group. Also, virtual character and real idol share the body through motion capture and augmented reality(AR). As a result, K/DA crosses virtual and reality, and at the same time becomes a pataphysical subject that does not belong to either virtual or reality. K/DA is suggested a third zone where digital subjects will be located in the future."

To accomplish the research purpose, a survey was administered to 250 cadets from the K Military Academy in October 2019. A total of 223 valid responses were analyzed using paired t-test to determine whether the mean difference between importance and performance for each capacity recognized by cadets was statistically significant. The results of the analysis showed statistically significant differences in all six core competencies. The quartile chart of the educational needs showed that the competencies of leadership, interpersonal relationship, and self management belong to maintaining area while the competencies of globalism, career development, and creativity belong to concentration area. In order to identify factors that significantly affect education needs of globalism, career development, creativity competencies, four independent variables were included in the multiple regression model: grade, academic major, GPA, hope for long-term tenure, and help-seeking behavior. The results of the multiple regression analysis showed that all of the independent variables were not statistically significant except the help-seeking behavior on the dependent of career development competency which belongs to concentration area. The results indicate that the more help-seeking actions were taken, the smaller the difference between the recognition of importance of career development capabilities and the performance of competency development."
가상밴드 K/DA에 대한 사용자 제작 콘텐츠(UCC) 특성,2020,"['UCC', 'Virtual Band', 'K/DA', 'League of Legend', 'Pentakill', 'Hatsune Miku']",,"In November 2018, virtual pop band K/DA, with the use of holograms and actual K-pop girl group members, performed its debut album titled ""POP/STARS"" at the opening ceremony of the League of Legends S8 final, hosted by Riot Games. The fan culture that exists for real singers adapts itself to virtual bands, and K/DA, consisting of virtual characters, encouraging the production of user created content (UCC). However, this form of UCC is different from the most common one, meaning that this type of band generates another way of consuming content. Therefore, this study examines how K/DA’s digital characters are transformed and reproduced by UCC and how the original producers’ content differs from them. Firstly, the development of this study considers the open characteristics of UCC, such as user type, created motivation, created process, content type and sharing method. In the second part, the virtual idol Hatsune Miku and virtual band Pentakill will be analysed to understand UCC. Thirdly, K/DA will be analyzed as a case study based on three factors: created motivation, content type and sharing method. In this manner, this study aims to explain how UCC for virtual bands reproduce and consume original content and expand their commercial value."
Evaluation of the Korea Meteorological Administration Advanced Community Earth-System model (K-ACE),2020,['CMIP6 . K-ACE . Earth-system model . Coupledmodel . Climatology'],,"Scientific community has been elaborating to better understand the observed climate and its variations, and to improve the capability for predicting future climate. Many modeling groups participating in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP) have been working towards multi-model ensemble approach that have become a standard technique for projecting future climate and for assessing associated uncertainties to deal with intrinsic shortcomings of climate models. Within this context, the National Institute of Meteorological Sciences/Korea Meteorological Administration (NIMS/KMA) has developed the KMA Advanced Community Earth-system model (K-ACE) under KMA-Met Office collaboration for climate research. This paper provides general descriptions of the first generation K-ACE model including the coupling strategy, as well as preliminary evaluations of the model performance in mean climate fields. The first generation K-ACE model appears to capture the mean climatology and the inter-annual variability of the observed climate. Horizontal distributions and the variability of the surface and pressure-level variables agree well with observations with correlation coefficients of 0.88–0.99 and 0.69–0.99, respectively. Measured in terms of performance index between the observed and simulated fields, the K-ACE performance is comparable with those of 29 CMIP5 models. This study also identifies key weaknesses of the KACE in the present-day climate. Improving these deficiencies will be a topic of future studies. The NIMS/KMA will employ the K-ACE model to contribute to the CMIP6 experiment."

Trends in Tidal Levels and Mean Sea Level in the Gulf of Thailand,2020,"['Gulf of Thailand', 'mean sea level', 'tidal constituent', 'tidal level', 'trend']",,"Astronomical tides have a major impact on coastal sediment distribution, seawater levels, coastal navigation, and other coastal dynamics. Any significant change to tides could have impacts on coastal ecosystems. This study explored the hourly water level from 11 tidal gauge stations along the Gulf of Thailand over different periods using harmonic analysis. Secular trends of tidal levels, tidal range, mean sea level and tidal constituents were assessed using a linear regression model. We found changes in all the tidal levels assessed. Increasing trends were observed for almost all tidal levels and the mean sea level at all locations. At most of the locations, the trends in tidal levels were similar to the mean sea level. Widespread increasing trends were observed in relation to the tidal levels, and in most cases, the trends were consistent with the mean sea level. Analysis of the tidal harmonic constituents showed significant trends for the luni-solar diurnal constituent (K1) at most stations. However, the magnitude of the trends in the harmonic constituents was less pronounced compared to the trends in water levels. Coastal management policies should take into account these widespread changes in tides."

To achieve these aims, this study utilized ratings of 407 parents of 3-to-5 years old Korean children. exploratory factor analysis(EFA) using half the sample(n = 202) and confirmatory factor analysis(CFA) using the second half of the sample(n = 205) were conducted to identify a four-factor structure for K-SIMS-PR (overt involvement, behavioral dysregulation, overt emotional reactivity, and overt avoidance). The latent mean analysis was also used to determine whether latent mean differences existed between girls and boys and whether the factors of K-SIMS-PR fitted well with mothers and fathers. In the EFA, 17 items with 4 factors were extracted and the K-SIMS-PR subscales demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency, ranging from .81 to .89. The CFA showed the K-SIMS-PR as a valid scale(CFI = .95, TLI = .93, RMSEA = .06), providing evidence of both the convergent and discriminant validities. The results from the latent mean analysis indicated that there was no child gender difference on all the factors of K-SIMS-PR. Parent gender difference existed only at the factor of overt emotional reactivity. Implications, limitations, and future studies were discussed."

This study aims to conduct empirical research into what are the practical factors required to sustain consumer brand engagement(CBE) in order to present the direction of future-oriented branding.Methods : The subject of this study is the ARMY, the fandom of the K-pop boy group, BTS, who have continued a close relationship with BTS. To analyze the meaning of personal experiences, I used a phenomenological approach by using not only in-depth interviews but also an online survey with global participants to enhance the reliability of the research results.Results : Phenomenological factor analysis of sustaining CBE has resulted in two categories; One is music as an element for developing differentiated and qualified brand and the other is social influences of the brand as a key element for a sustaining relationship. Excellent quality of music along with empathetic lyrics and performance were derived as theme clusters. The second category, brand’s influences, comes up with inspiring, personality, sincerity and communication as theme clusters. In comparison with the establishing factors of CBE, the percentage of the social influences of the brand, which can be said to be the intrinsic nature of brands and the social value, have increased very much.Conclusions : Brand management as the platform of social meaning and value creation is the prerequisite of the sustainability of the brand. Therefore, creative and future-oriented branding that leads a new paradigm should be a sincere platform for urging consumers to act voluntarily in the form of a verb with a present progressive form."

The dictionary meaning of ākāra is shape, image, and so on but it has various Chinese translated words such as 行相, 取相, 相 etc. Among them 行相 a tranalated word of 玄奘, implies that 行 is the role of subject and 相 is the role of object. in the case of Sarvāstivādin, it can be seen that role of subject in the definition of 有行相(sākāra). In the case of Sautrāntika 行相 is the main basis for recognition. On the other hand, According to 成唯識論 the subjective 行相 and the object 行相 appesrs on the vijñāna fron vijñāna. The subjective 行相 is 見分 and the objective 行相 is 相分. 行相 of 見分 is defind 了別(vijñapti). 行相 of 見分 can be 了別(vijñapti) 行相 of 相分. 了別(vijñapti) is not the subjectivity knowing the object, but appearing like a 行相 on the vijñāna. All is only manifested as a 行相 from the vijñāna. Therefore, there is no external object only what appears(vijñapti, 了別) to exist. After the term 行相(ākāra) reveals the clues of the subjective role in the Sarvāstivādin, it has established itself as a basis for recognition in the Sautrāntika and settled as a concept that has a more complete from terms and in the content in the Yogācāra."

The aim of the study was to evaluate low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction in 53 patients suffering from polygenic hypercholesterolemia, characterized by a low/intermediate cardiovascular risk calculated with SCORE algorithm. The effects on lipid profile of 2-month treatment with NUT containing MonK+KA (1:1), BBR, and sylimarin, were compared with Atorvastatin (ATO) 10 mg administrated in a matched control group. Serum proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) levels and the cholesterol loading capacity (CLC) were determined at baseline and at the end of the study in NUT-treated group; variations were assessed. NUT was effective as lipid-lowering agent with a wide interindividual response variability (mean LDL-C from 170.8 ± 19.9 to 123.8 ± 20.0 with a change of −47.0 ± 21.5 mg/dL; P < .001) and the effect was similar to that induced by ATO. The use of NUT significantly modified PCSK9 levels (P < .01) and CLC (P < .001), ultimately suppressing the serum-mediated foam cell generation directly measured on human macrophages. NUT reduces LDL-C levels with an effect similar to what is induced by 10 mg of ATO and ex vivo improves the functional profile of lipoproteins with antiatherogenic action."

Understanding Human Suffering and Jesus Prayer (Matthew 6:9-13) -In View of Asian Yangdanjõk (兩端的) Wisdom in Epistemology,2020,"['Jesus Prayer', 'Christianity', 'Human Suffering', 'Yangdanjok Wisdom', 'Asian Religions', 'Subject-Object Discrimination', 'Emptiness and Dependent Origination', '4 Levels of Prayer Practice', '예수기도문', '기독교', '인간고통', '양단적(兩端的) 지혜', '아시아 종교', '주객분리', '공(空)과 연기(緣起)', '4단계 기도']","본고는 예수께서 기도문(주기도문)을 통해 과연 인간고통의 문제를 어떻게 다루는지 살피기 위해, 유대 지혜전승 뿐만 아니라 아시아 종교의 인식론적 지혜를 활용한다. 해석학적으로 기독교는 기존의 가치들을 좀 더 강화하고 활성화하기 위하여, 많은 부분들을 다른 종교들이 가지는 깨달음과 빛에 비추어 볼 필요가 있다. 왜냐하면 공통의 인류 사회 속에서 그것들 또한 많은 사람들에 의해 지지를 받고 있어서, 결코 간과해서는 안되기 때문이다. 본고는 그러한 과정을 통하여 단순히 기독교 예배의 폐회를 위한 장식용으로 잠자고 있던 상투적인 기도문이 아니라, 사실상 예수 그리스도의 엄청난 통찰력과 신학적 창조성이 있음을 발견하게 된다. 주객 분리적이며 이원론적인 서구적 사고가 아니라, “하늘에서처럼 땅에서도”라는 구절의 통사론적 해석을 통해 드러나듯이, 개인이 아니라 개인을 포함한 전체, 하늘만이 아니라 땅까지 포함한 전체로서의 포함(包含)을 말한다. 예수의 복음적 관심이 매우 우주적이며 통전적임을 드러낸 것이다. 그러한 지혜는 Q와 마태복음 안에서 예수기도문의 정확한 배경과 상황을 이해할 수 있도록 촉구함으로써, 순회설교자들의 공동체와 이후의 신앙공동체가 당면하였던 도무지 납득할 수 없었던 문제와 고통을 중심으로 당시 사회문화적으로 이해될 수 있는 적실한 방식으로 해결방안을 찾을 수 있도록 도와준다. 전도서와 다니엘 그리고 나아가 쿰란 공동체가 발전시킨 지혜뿐만 아니라, 아시아인들의 인식론에 깊이 자리하고 있던 아시아적 고유의 지혜체계는 결국 인간고통의 문제를 인식하거나 해결하는 과정을 매우 색다르게 접근하도록 돕는다. 아시아의 인식론은 우주의 연속성과 더불어, 그 안에서 서로 연결되어 끊임없이 창조되고 순환하는 세계에 대하여 직각(直覺)하는 특징을 갖는다. 놀랍게도 예수 역시 이미 산상수훈에서 풍부하게 드러나고 있듯이 불가지한 삶의 고통에 대하여 다소간 현실체계에 완전히 동화(同化) 되면서도 동시에 신앙적 동질성을 유지하는 양단적 지혜를 이미 활용하였다. 물론 이후의 기독교는 서구철학을 내면화하고 정식화하면서 이러한 예수의 독특한, 매우 아시아적이고 양단적인, 해석학을 상실하거나 희석해 버렸다. 결국 예수기도문은 고통 가운데 있는 인간들이 궁극적 진리를 확정하려고 벌이는 신앙적 관심과 노력에 한계가 있음을 암시하면서도 그러한 고통이 의미없는 허상인 것처럼 치부해버리지는 않는다. 오히려 자신의 고통을 짊어진 채 자신의 문제를 넘어 공동체의 고통을 나누고 해결하기 위해 함께 연대하는 삶을 살도록 한다. 아시아적 지혜를 고찰하면서, 연구자는 예수기도문을 보편적인 기도와 묵상의 방편으로 삼아, 그 속에서 성령-지혜-능력-평화의 4단계 실천적, 수행적 패턴을 제시한다.","Referring to Asian epistemology, this work explores how Asian wisdom shed a tremendous light on Christian understanding of Jesus Prayer, pertinent to Jesus’ response to the problem of human suffering. Through formulating a reasonable contingency, Jesus Prayer at that time, still standing in the flux of Jewish wisdom tradition, appears to provide the frustrated faith community as well as his perturbed disciples with wisdom of assimilation and integration in society. This exploration prompts Christians to utilize their commitment and enrich many dimensions of truth among themselves by openness to deep insights and lights of others which cannot be neglected. It may involve a serious risk of confusion in Christian identity, but surely will be helpful for its fertilization. The yangdanjõk perspective, surely found in Jesus Prayer, tells the wisdom of how to deal with and solve desperate problems of human suffering, although which it would be soon blurred and lost in the following Western philosophical dualism. Never comprehensible by illusory conceptualization, even theological formulation, which is deconstructed and nullified as meaningless by Jesus, the reality in and of itself shows what it has ever been as it is. It is not different from the recurring message of wisdom: Just “fear of the Lord” by emptiness and union with him, in solidarity with the suffering communities. This yangdanjõk (兩端的) wisdom, similar to the wisdom teaching in Asian Religions, “Sanggubori hahwajungsaeng” (上求菩提 下化衆生), is tantamount to an urge to live in the undifferentiated continuum. Hence for proper rendering of yangdanjõk meaning of Jesus Prayer into English or Korean, the adverbial clause (i.e., “As in Heaven, also on earth”) may need to relocate just before the first Thou petition (i..e, “Hallowed be your name”), in which the Prayer clearly exposes Jesus’ ultimate concern dovetailed heaven and earth. Jesus Prayer was not tailoring a platform for theological, conceptual and logical formulation to deliver individuals, but rather show Jesus’ followers, more probably as his personal experience did, a practical wisdom to save the entirety, engaging in solidarity with suffering people, still maintaining the faith of fearing God. In order to fully internalize the power and significance of Jesus Prayer, a yangdanjõk contemplating practice in the four levels, i.e., Spirit, Wisdom, Power, and Peace, is suggested."

"Early Experience, Setup, Learning Curve, Benefits, and Complications Associated with Exoscope and Three-Dimensional 4K Hybrid Digital Visualizations in Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery",2020,"['Exoscope', 'Minimally invasive spine surgery']",,"Study Design: Prospective observational study (n=74).Purpose: To evaluate the learning curve for exoscope and three-dimensional (3D) 4K hybrid visualization in terms of operating time, advantages, disadvantages, and surgical complications in tubular-access minimally invasive spine surgery (MISS) and to assess surgeon satisfaction with image quality, ergonomics, and ability to perform target site treatment.Overview of Literature: Working through tubular retractors poses a challenge. The extreme angulations during microsurgical decompression, especially contralateral decompression, require surgeons to work non-ergonomically. An exoscope allows surgeons to work ergonomically and independently of the microscope oculars as visualizations are now provided by large 3D 4K monitors. However, the value and efficacy of solely depending on an exoscope and 3D 4K monitors during microsurgical work are still unknown.Methods: Seventy-four patients (99 levels) underwent trans-tubular MISS between March 2018 and January 2019. Five patients were excluded: one had pyogenic discitis, two had revisions, and two were trans-tubular transoral. In total, we analyzed 69 for operating time, blood loss, and complications. The learning curve graph was plotted using the surgical time for each procedure. Surgeons were asked to rate their satisfaction with image quality, ability to maintain ergonomic posture, and efficient target site treatment.Results: For tubular microdiscectomy, the operating time plateaued after six cases, and for tubular decompression and minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion, the operating time plateaued after nine cases. Mean operating time was significantly reduced after the plateau. Complications included four cases of dural tear. All patients improved symptomatically, and there were no postoperative neurological deficits.Conclusions: Use of the exoscope has a short learning curve. Surgeons benefit from improved ergonomic posture during surgery, and resident teaching appears to be good. The only drawback is the need to rearrange the operating table setup. Complications were comparable to those when using the surgical microscope. An exoscope with hybrid digital visualization provides excellent visualization, depth perception, clarity, and precision target site treatment."

This study is conducted by analyzing the examples of recently released various record packages as good design elements through package design and design marketing strategies through major features, shapes and sizes, and MD components. If the past record package design was made for the purpose of simply protecting the inner record, after the 2000s, it changed to a different purpose and meaning to represent visual merchandise and symbolism. Especially since the late 2000s, as the idol industry has been activated and visual concepts and design elements have diversified, album package designs have emerged in a new form according to the concept image through externally various sizes, shapes, and materials. By incorporating MD components through techniques, the value of possession is increasing compared to the past. Therefore, the elements of emphasis in terms of good design are different from the modern album package design. In particular, aesthetics and originality appear to be common features so far, and functionality and purposefulness appear differently depending on the concept."

Preaching is distinguished by its nature from what those acts of communication have with its divine, spiritual and faithful aspects. Thus, the practical task of preaching should be integrated to the theological task. The purpose of this study is to make a theological statement honestly and clearly about ambiguous realities of practicing the task of preaching. The ambiguous realities consist of the ambiguity of preaching between human word and God’s word, uncertain understandings of God’s word that is not identified with preaching, but also witnessed to by it, and complex riddle of faith confessing that “preaching is God’s word” on me and us. Accordingly, this study purposes to find out a coherent theological statement on those subjects and present useful directions, at a more profound level, for talks and practice of preaching. For this goal, the dogmatics on God’s word of Karl Barth would give me helpful guide and direction for searching for the answer to what I am asking to. The subjects of Barth’s dogmatics on which this study focuses are the dual tension of preaching, the three-fold revelation and its identification and dis-identification with God’s word, identity of God’s word, and the word of God as a coming word and eventful-ness of preaching. Above all, the word of God as a ‘coming word,’ which is related to the more essential and intricate questions, tries to answer to two questions that follow: one is “What is God’s word that is not only distinguished from words of preaching, but is also revealed through them by God?” The other is “What does it mean for preaching to be God’s word for us, which is not God’s, and how do we sense it and how do we identify and state it theologically?” In conclusion, this study is, through the dialogue with Barth’s dogmatics on God’s word, to examine theological answers to the questions on realities of preaching and, based on this examination, to propose subjects that should be dealt with in homiletic talks and practice of preaching."

"BMD42-2910, a Novel Benzoxazole Derivative, Shows a Potent Anti-prion Activity and Prolongs the Mean Survival in an Animal Model of Prion Disease",2020,"['Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy', 'Prion protein', 'Anti-prion', 'Derivatives', 'In silico']",,"Prion diseases are a group of neurodegenerative and fatal central nervous system disorders. The pathogenic mechanism involves the conversion of cellular prion protein (PrPC ) to an altered scrapie isoform (PrPSc), which accumulates in amyloid deposits in the brain. However, no therapeutic drugs have demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials. We previously reported that BMD42-29, a synthetic compound discovered in silico, is a novel anti-prion compound that inhibits the conversion of PrPC to protease K (PK)-resistant PrPSc fragments (PrPres). In the present study, 14 derivatives of BMD42-29 were obtained from BMD42-29 by modifying in the side chain by in silico feedback, with the aim to determine whether they improve anti-prion activity. These derivatives were assessed in a PrPSc-infected cell model and some derivatives were further tested using real timequaking induced conversion (RT-QuIC). Among them, BMD42-2910 showed high anti-prion activity at low concentrations in vitro and also no toxic effects in a mouse model. Interestingly, abundant PrPres was reduced in brains of mice infected with prion strain when treated with BMD42- 2910, and the mice survived longer than control mice and even that treated with BMD42-29. Finally, high binding affinity was predicted in the virtual binding sites (Asn159, Gln 160, Lys194, and Glu196) when PrPC was combined with BMD-42-2910. Our findings showed that BMD42-2910 sufficiently reduces PrPres generation in vitro and in vivo and may be a promising novel anti-prion compound."

The location data of 193 pine wilt disease trees were constructed through field surveys and vegetation index analyses of NDVI, GNDVI, NDRE and SAVI were performed using multi-spectral UAV images at the same time. K-Means algorithm was adopted to classify damaged trees and confusion matrix was used to compare and analyze the classification accuracy. The results of the study are summarized as follows. First, the overall accuracy of the classification was analyzed in order of NDVI (88.04%, Kappa coefficient 0.76) > GNDVI (86.01%, Kappa coefficient 0.72) > NDRE (77.35%, Kappa coefficient 0.55) > SAVI (76.84%, Kappa coefficient 0.54) and showed the highest accuracy of NDVI. Second, K-Means unsupervised classification method using NDVI or GNDVI is possible to some extent to find out the damaged trees. In particular, this technique is to help early detection of damaged trees due to its intensive operation, low user intervention and relatively simple analysis process. In the future, it is expected that the utilization of time series images or the application of deep learning techniques will increase the accuracy of classification."
On hierarchical clustering in sufficient dimension reduction,2020,"['central subspace', 'hierarchical clustering', 'informative predictor subspace', 'K-means clustering', 'multivariate slicing', 'sufficient dimension reduction']",,"The K-means clustering algorithm has had successful application in sufficient dimension reduction. Unfortunately, the algorithm does have reproducibility and nestness, which will be discussed in this paper. These are clear deficits for the K-means clustering algorithm; however, the hierarchical clustering algorithm has both reproducibility and nestness, but intensive comparison between K-means and hierarchical clustering algorithm has not yet been done in a sufficient dimension reduction context. In this paper, we rigorously study the two clustering algorithms for two popular sufficient dimension reduction methodology of inverse mean and clustering mean methods throughout intensive numerical studies. Simulation studies and two real data examples confirm that the use of hierarchical clustering algorithm has a potential advantage over the K-means algorithm."

Regional differences in Busan, Ulsan, and Gyeongnam related to high PM10 episodes, were clarified through the statistical comparison study using synoptic scale meteorological elements using NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction/FNL (Final Operational Global Analysis) re-analysis meteorological data. Meteorological patterns were classified into a total of five categories (C1-C5). The incidence of each cluster was 24.8% (C1), 21.3% (C2), 20.4% (C3), 17.3% (C4), and 16.2% (C5), respectively. The high PM10 concentration in the southeastern region resulted from long and short range transports (C1, C3, C5) from outside of the region, and the emissions (C2, C4) inside the region. In the high PM10 episodes in Busan, Ulsan, and Gyeongnam regions, meteorological characteristics such as different geopotential height and wind speed at 500 hPa in each cluster and the change in the location of high pressure over Korean Peninsula is strongly associated with the dispersion of PM10 around inventories in the region and the tendency of long-range transportation of PM10 emitted from outside of region."

As a result, the decision to adoption K-IFRS is highly regarded internationally. However, even after the adoption of K-IFRS, the national ranking for accounting transparency is still low, and it has declined compared to before it was adoption. In addition, opinions are constantly being raised that in practice, the ambiguous K-IFRS is increase for accounting fraudulent and there are a lot of options for accounting.In this study, the effect of K-IFRS introduction on accounting information quality was verified using a supervisory company.

고속도로 정체 기준 속도의 적정성 검토 및 개선 연구,2020,['K-means'],,"Much time has passed since Korea's expressway congestion-threshold speed was revised in 2011. In the meantime, various expressway environments have changed owing to improved performance of vehicles, expanded operations of transport competition (i.e., the KTX), and increased speed limits along some expressway sections. In addition, the speed that expressway users expect to travel at is also increasing. Therefore, through a survey, this study investigates expressway users' perceptions of congestion, and reviews the adjustment of the expressway speed congestion threshold by analyzing expressway traffic flow. One result of the survey confirms that the threshold speed expressway users consider to be congestion has slightly increased. Analyzing traffic and speed data through a K-means algorithm found that the threshold speed for congestion is 60 km/h. In addition, assuming the congestion threshold speed increase from 40 km/h to 50 km/h and 60 km/h, frequently congested expressway sections are identified, determining that 50 km/h is appropriate as a congestion threshold for proper expressway mobility management."

The joint analysis of dimension reduction and clustering is known to perform better than tandem analysis that sequentially conducts dimension reduction and clustering. On the other hand, most data include missing values. When cluster analysis is conducted with incomplete data, incomplete observations can not be classified into any group. To avoid this problem, it is common to impute missing values before conducting cluster analysis. In this study, we suggest a method for combining dimension reduction k-means clustering and missing data imputation. The suggested method has an advantage to accurate classify observations through imputation using cluster information. A simulation is conducted to evaluate performance of the suggested method and compare the result with the one based on tandem analysis. The suggested method using an appropriate dimension reduction k-means clustering showed lower misclassification rates than tandem analysis."

After that, the optimum image treatment is applied using morphological image processing and median filtering to remove unnecessary noise, such as blobs. In the second step, the preprocessed image is converted to grayscale, and any cracks present in the image are identified. Next, the region properties, such as the number of pixels and the ratio of the major to the minor axis, are used to separate the cracks from the noise.

While the term “internal reserve amount” first appeared in a 1933 article, the last fifteen years have seen it become widely (misused and) misunderstood. In this study, we collect news articles printed between 2010 and 2019 and find that the progressive media had published significantly more articles mentioning “internal reserve amount” than the conservative media. The difference in misuse rates, however, is not significant. For a large-scale analysis, we examine the articles containing the term and apply K-Means clustering (machine learning methodology) to classify them into two groups. We find that the difference in the use of sensationalistic words is statistically significant between the two media groups, indicating systematic differences in the use of sensationalistic words by press. We further find that the number of sensationalized feelings among readers and the use of offensive language in the comment sections are higher for groups with more sensationalistic words. Such differences in reader reactions imply that words used in press articles may stimulate social conflicts concerning the “internal reserve amount”. Overall, as the first study for the media coverage of “internal reserve amount” using machine learning technology, this study shows that the misuse of words by media may increase social conflict surrounding business environment."

Application of the covariance matrix clustering algorithm for partitioning joint sets having various joint pole sizes and densities,2020,"['Joint sets delineation', 'clustering analysis', 'K-means algorithm', 'equal-size problem']",,"An analysis of data collected on rock discontinuities mostly requires the data to be separated into sets. An automatic clustering algorithm that assists in identification of joint sets is always desired. Several algorithms have been proposed, most of which are based on the widely used fuzzy K-means method in which the optimization step involves minimizing the sum of squared distances between objects and the centroids of clusters. Empirical studies have demonstrated that this method tends to generate equally sized clusters, which means clusters of different sizes cannot be adequately distinguished (equal-size problem). This paper introduces the application of a clustering method that applies an optimization criterion based on the estimated covariance matrix to overcome the aforementioned equal-size problem of the K-means clustering scheme. The applicability of the method is demonstrated using both artificial and field data with low dimensionality."

Main subjects are defined using K-means clustering algorithm, and detailed subjects are defined using topic modeling of petitions belonging to the main subjects. Also, long short-term memory (LSTM) is used for prediction of answerable petitions. Not only title and contents but also categories, length of text, and ratio of part of speech such as noun, adjective, adverb, verb are also used for the proposed model. Our experimental results show that the type 2 model using other features such as ratio of part of speech, length of text, and categories outperforms the type 1 model without other features."

Therefore, this study seeks to achieve more objective results and research efficiency by utilizing machine learning among artificial intelligence technologies that have been applied to various studies recently. The subjects of the study are limited to the cover and the first section of music textbooks for the third and fourth graders(nine types per grade, 18 volumes in total) according to revised music curriculum of 2015. As one of the machine learning techniques, K-mean Clustering in this research classifies the top 10 colors in the textbooks, and the HEX codes are converted to NCS codes through our proposed color conversion method.In this study, the results are as follows; First, regardless of the name of each chapter, textbooks, which consist of four to six chapters, only consider four season-related colors and images for music education. Second, chapter in the textbooks mostly uses colors and nuances of the GY(Green Yellow) and YR(Yellow Red), the neutral color scale and low-color chroma. Furthermore, the results show that the color of the cover for each chapter is mainly used as an accent or a dominant color, which is highly related to the text of each chapter this research focuses on. That is, although there are differences in colors in textbooks for each publisher, most of them set color images of each chapter and reflect them throughout the chapters to maintain color consistency in each chapter. However, given the importance of child color experience, various changes in the use and chroma of different colors are required. Lastly, this study also suggests that rather than fixed color images on a seasonal basis, it is more effective for music education to present the illustrations and colors matching the music score."

At this time, the employment effect was approached by the observation of direct employment effect (employment growth rate) and new employment effect (sales-employment coefficient). In addition, based on 7 years of work experience, the analysis was conducted by dividing into a group of start-up companies and non-start-up companies.   In the first K-means clustering, three direct employment effects clusters and three new employment effects clusters were classified into nine employment effect clusters. Afterwards, ANCOVA with control variables was used to determine whether there was a significant difference in employment effects among clusters under the control of age of the company and size of firms.  In particular, ten industrial technologies show high employment effects in both the start-up and non-start-up business groups, and five of them belong to ICT. Therefore, we confirmed the possibility of driving job creation through investment and support for the technology. In addition, six technologies besides aerospace / space system technology have evolved from direct employment advantage technology to high employment creation technology or new employment advantage technology. Through this, policy implications for small and medium enterprises in industrial technology were drawn."

We analyzed 537 SKU sales data of T-shirts in the domestic sports brand using SAS program. The sales pattern of fashion products fluctuated and were influenced by exogenous factors; therefore, we removed the influence of exogenous factors found to be price discounts and holiday effects as a result of regression analysis. In addition, it was difficult to predict sales using the sales patterns of the same product since fashion products were released as new products every year. Therefore, the forecasting model was proposed using sales patterns of related product attributes when attributes were considered descriptive variables. We classified sales patterns using K-means clustering in order to explain the relationship between sales patterns and product attributes along with creating a decision tree classifier using attributes as input and sales patterns as output. As a result, the sales patterns of T-shirts were clustered into six types that featured the characteristic shape of peak and slope. It was also associated with the combination of product attributes and their values in regards to the proposed sales pattern prediction model."

The target vowels were restricted to those produced by adult males. The k was increased stepwise from 3 to 9 to see what phonological features appeared to be active in separating a new cluster from the originating cluster. It was found that the feature [±back] is one of the primary features that differentiates vowel classes and the feature [±high] is used in subsequent separations of the vowel classes. It was also found that high confusability in the perception of vowels is attributable to overlapping distributions of the samples. Vowel duration is critical in clarifying /ɔ/ and /ʌ/, and /ɛ/ and /æ/ as was reported in Hillendbrand et al. (2000). In our study, /æ/ was the second last and /ɔ/ was the last cluster separated from /ɛ, æ/ and /ʌ, ɔ/ clusters, respectively."
Lossless Compression for Hyperspectral Images based on Adaptive Band Selection and Adaptive Predictor Selection,2020,"['hyperspectral image lossless compression', 'conventional recursive least squares', 'k-means clustering', 'adaptive band selection', 'adaptive predictor selection']",,"With the wide application of hyperspectral images, it becomes more and more important to compress hyperspectral images. Conventional recursive least squares (CRLS) algorithm has great potentiality in lossless compression for hyperspectral images. The prediction accuracy of CRLS is closely related to the correlations between the reference bands and the current band, and the similarity between pixels in prediction context. According to this characteristic, we present an improved CRLS with adaptive band selection and adaptive predictor selection (CRLS-ABS-APS). Firstly, a spectral vector correlation coefficient-based k-means clustering algorithm is employed to generate clustering map. Afterwards, an adaptive band selection strategy based on inter-spectral correlation coefficient is adopted to select the reference bands for each band. Then, an adaptive predictor selection strategy based on clustering map is adopted to select the optimal CRLS predictor for each pixel. In addition, a double snake scan mode is used to further improve the similarity of prediction context, and a recursive average estimation method is used to accelerate the local average calculation. Finally, the prediction residuals are entropy encoded by arithmetic encoder. Experiments on the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) 2006 data set show that the CRLS-ABS-APS achieves average bit rates of 3.28 bpp, 5.55 bpp and 2.39 bpp on the three subsets, respectively. The results indicate that the CRLS-ABS-APS effectively improves the compression effect with lower computation complexity, and outperforms to the current state-of-the-art methods."
Production planning and scheduling problem of continuous parallel lines with demand uncertainty and different production capacities,2020,"['Integrated production planning and scheduling problem', 'discrete artificial bee colony (DABC)', 'k-means clustering algorithm', 'Monte Carlo simulation']",,"Production planning and scheduling problems are highly interdependent as scheduling provides optimum allocation of resources and planning is an optimum utilization of these allocated resources to serve multiple customers. Researchers have solved production planning and scheduling problems by the sequential method. But, in this case, the solution obtained by the production planning problem may not be feasible for scheduling method. Hence, production planning and scheduling problems must be solved simultaneously. Therefore, in this work, a mathematical model is developed to integrate production planning and scheduling problems. The solution to this integrated planning and scheduling problem is attempted by using a discrete artificial bee colony (DABC) algorithm. To speed up the DABC algorithm, a k-means clustering algorithm is used in the initial population generation phase. This k-means clustering algorithm will help to converge the algorithm in lesser time. A real-life case study of a soap manufacturing industry is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. An objective function to minimize overall cost, which comprises the processing cost, material cost, utility cost, and changeover cost, is considered. The results obtained by using DABC algorithm are compared with those obtained by CPLEX software. There is a saving of ₹2 23 324 for weeks 1–4 in overall cost compared with the results obtained by using CPLEX software."

However, in the case of vehicles having a particular operating environment, there are difficulties assessing the performance when using the usual driving cycle. For instance, the courier vehicles have significant differences from the typical driving cycles, such as the maximum speed, the average speed, and the idle time ratio. Therefore, development of the driving cycle to estimate the performance of vehicles operating with a non-usual driving pattern is needed. For this purpose, this study conducts the driving cycle reflecting the actual driving characteristics. The DTG (Digital TachoGraph) data that the actual trajectory is used. It is collected from the commercial courier trucks with a load limit of 1 ton. Initially, authors divided the total trajectory into micro-trips, which is the data between stops (0km/h). Then the authors extracted the driving properties of each micro-trip. After that, the authors clustered the features and generate a driving cycle based on the clustering results. In result, a representative driving cycle is synthesized from the actual data with 2,254 seconds, 6.86km/h average speed, and 0.48 idle time ratio."
Automatic Change Detection Using Unsupervised Saliency Guided Method with UAV and Aerial Images,2020,"['UAV', 'Aerial Image', 'Change Detection', 'Disaster', 'Saliency', 'CVA', 'PCA', 'K-means']",,"In this paper, an unsupervised saliency guided change detection method using UAV and aerial imagery is proposed. Regions that are more different from other areas are salient, which make them more distinct.The existence of the substantial difference between two images makes saliency proper for guiding the change detection process. Change Vector Analysis (CVA), which has the capability of extracting of overall magnitude and direction of change from multi-spectral and temporal remote sensing data, is used for generating an initial difference image. Combined with an unsupervised CVA and the saliency, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which is possible to implemented as the guide for change detection method, is proposed for UAV and aerial images. By implementing the saliency generation on the difference map extracted via the CVA, potentially changed areas obtained, and by thresholding the saliency map, most of the interest areas correctly extracted. Finally, the PCA method is implemented to extract features, and K-means clustering is applied to detect changed and unchanged map on the extracted areas. This proposed method is applied to the image sets over the flooded and typhoon-damaged area and is resulted in 95 percent better than the PCA approach compared with manually extracted ground truth for all the data sets. Finally, we compared our approach with the PCA K-means method to show the effectiveness of the method."

For this computation, a 100 × 200 square meters size of virtual battlefield is created where an augmented enemy infantry platoon unit attacks, defences, and is scatted, and a virtual weapon with a lethal range of 15m is modeled. In order to determine damage types of the enemy unit: no damage, light wound, heavy wound and death, Monte carlo simulation is performed to apply the Carlton damage function for the damage effect of the soft targets. In addition, in order to achieve the damage effectiveness of the enemy units in line with the commander's intention, the optimal shot numbers and aiming point locations are calculated in less than 0.4 seconds by applying the k-mean clustering and repetitive Monte carlo simulation. It is hoped that this study will help to develop a system that reduces the decision time for 'detection-decision-shoot' process in battalion-scaled combat units operating Dronebot combat system."

At this time, this paper finds its origin in the periods from the ‘June 1987 struggle to the May 1991 struggle’ and in the 1990s. The period from the June 1987 struggle to the May 1991 struggle was the time when the forces of the social transformation movement eventually defeated in the struggle over setting the boundaries of democracy. And the 1990s was a period in which labor, which is the social foundation of democracy, and equality, which is the core value, were excluded by the state and capital initiative. This means that the political and social problem consciousness, subject and value for expanding the horizon of democracy have been weakened and limited."

몸의 움직임에 주목하는 교양교육의 의미,2020,"['교양교육', '예술적 추상화 과정', '상징 형식', '몸의 움직임 수업', '몸의 정체성', 'liberal education', 'abstraction in art', 'symbolic form', 'body-movement in liberal education', 'identity of body']",,"This article considers a way of understanding of the relationship between oneself, others, and the world that is centered on the sensibility, emotions, and sensitivity of the body, which have not received much attention in the tradition of liberal arts education, agreeing with the responsibility of having to cultivate integrated and universal ability of the learners of liberal arts education. To this end, a philosopher Susan K. Langer’s concepts of the ‘symbol’ and the ‘abstract process’ are considered to be concepts upon which these liberal arts education classes can be grounded. Langer defines the symbolic form of arts as an expression of human’s inner life and an output of mental function that can be seen by objectifying the essence of human emotions. I think the key process that makes this possible is in the unique abstraction process in arts, and this is because Langer’s concepts can be considered to be an appropriate foundation for constructing the meaning of arts and the process itself. Specifically, this process of the abstraction can be understood as a deductive reasoning through which the abstract concepts are derived from general ideas. However, in the field of arts, it can be understood as a process of calculating the logical form that grasps the organic relation between the whole and the partial even though it is invisible; eventually, this is a kind of logic that can help us develop an ability to look at our lives intuitively and syntagmatically.This article aims to assert that this ability is a universal competency that our age demands. In order to develop these ideas more specifically and to understand them vividly, I observed the characteristics of the artistic process by observing and interviewing the actual liberal arts class which focuses on the movement on the body. Henceforth, I believe there will be various educational meanings that can be derived from this process of formation of our body identity."

Ryu, who laid the foundation in Korean criminal law, presented several very original thoughts in his criminal law theory. This article focuses on ‘the theory of symbolic criminal law’ (symbolische Strafrechtslehre) among them. The theory of symbolic criminal law was an original theory that Professor Paul K. Ryu devoted his life to, but it was not properly illuminated in Korean academic world. This is regrettable given the academic level and performance that the theory of symbolic criminal law is reaching. Even from this point of view, the theory of symbolic criminal law provides several theoretical and practical implications. In this consciousness of the problem, this article analyzes the theory of symbolic criminal law from the standpoint of a criminal law philosophy. In particular, it examines what philosophical theory the theory of symbolic criminal law is based on, and how the theory of symbolic criminal laws developed in Prof. Paul K. Ryu’s criminal law theory, and what it contains in detail. According to the analysis of this article, the theory of symbolic criminal law embraced the philosophy and theory of Whitehead, Northrop, and Whorf. From Whitehead, the theory of symbolic criminal law accepted the theory of language as a symbol, the theory of pluralistic concepts from Northrop, and the principle of linguistic relativity from Whorf. Accordingly, the theory of symbolic criminal law emphasizes that the language constituting the criminal law norms is a symbol. The symbolic language and its target form a relative and multidimensional relationship rather than an absolute relationship. In other words, the language constituting the criminal law norms is multi-dimensional, multi-contextual in its structural, relative and instrumental dimensions. In the linguistic concept prescribed by the criminal law, its meaning is constructed in three dimensions according to which temporal, vertical and relational structures, in what legal areas, and for what legal purposes. Prof. Paul K. Ryu developed this theory of symbolic criminal law into a general theory of criminal law. The theory of symbolic criminal law is a multidimensional general theory. It covers a wide range from the images of human being to criminal law dogmatics. At the same time, the theory of symbolic criminal law integrates criminal policy and criminal dogmatics, like Franz von Liszt and Claus Roxin. Of course, at the same time, the constitutional spirit and the free society are emphasized as the limit of this teleological criminal dogmatics proposed by the theory of symbolic criminal law. This theory of symbolic criminal law also has practical implications as follows. The fact that the criminal system is never a complete system, and that constructing criminal law dogmatics should focus on teleological thinking."

This means that as the related party transaction increases, the cost of capital, such as the cost of debt, equity, and weighted average capital, increases. In addition, as a result of analyzing the effect of related party transactions of related party transactions on upper and lower groups on capital costs, related party transactions of related party transaction subgroups pay attention to capital costs such as debt capital costs, equity capital costs, and weighted average capital costs. It was found to have a negative(－) effect. On the other hand, it was found that the related party transactions of the related group of the related group had a significant positive effect on capital costs such as the cost of debt, equity capital, and weighted average capital cost.[Implications] It is significant that the information asymmetry increases due to transactions between related parties, and as a result, the cost of capital increases as the risk to the company increases. It also suggests that these effects may vary depending on the size of the transaction."

In this way, death is a bodily escape, as the butterfly escapes the cocoon; this is a metamorphosis. Ernst Cassirer, in his philosophy of culture, also grasps death as metamorphosis. In particular, Cassirer focuses on primitive mentality and the characteristics of mythical thought in order to understand death. Through this discussion, Cassirer suggests a cognitive foundation for the phenomenon of death.In this context, we explore the mythical perception and understanding of space in Cassirer's perspective, and we discuss death in terms of primitive lifestyle and attitude. Finally, the phenomenon, fact, meaning, and message of death will be explained."
Population structure analysis of Yeonsan Ogye using microsatellite markers,2020,"['Genetic diversity study', 'K-mean clustering', 'Microsatellite marker', 'Yeonsan Ogye chicken']",,"The Yeonsan Ogye (YO) chicken is a natural heritage of Korea, characterized by black feathers, skin, bones, eyes, and comb. The purebred of YO population has been reared under the natural mating system with no systematic selection and breeding plan. The purpose of this study was to identify the genetic diversity and find the optimal number of population sub-division using 12 polymorphic microsatellite (MS) markers to construct a pedigree-based breeding plan for the YO population. A total of 509 YO birds were used for this study. Genetic diversity and population structure analysis were conducted based on the MS marker genotype information. The overall average polymorphic information content value and expected heterozygosity of the population were 0.586, and 0.642, respectively. The K-mean cluster analysis based on the genetic distance result confirmed that the current YO population can be divided into three ancestry groups. Individuals in each group were evaluated based on their genetic distance to identify the potential candidates for a future breeding plan. This study concludes that a future breeding plan with known pedigree information of selected founder animals, which holds high genetic diversity, could be the best strategy to ensure the conservation of the Korean YO chicken population."

As a result, the study found that the character ‘cha’ officially appeared in the book Cha Jing (The Classic of Tea) as a reference to the concept of tea for the first time, based on records from Pronunciation and Meaning of Kaiyuan Characters. Moreover, ‘cha’ was used to represent the sound of the Siddhamātṛkā-character ‘ḍha’ in Buddhist scriptures even before it was first written in Cha Jing. The Siddam character ‘ḍha’ represents a complete state of vimokṣa and nirvāṇa, catva‘rismrtyupastha’na (four foundations of mindfulness), the practice of upāya in Esoteric Buddhism, and the practices of śamatha and vipaśyanā in Mahāyāna Buddhism in major Buddhist scriptures. It can be estimated that ‘cha’ may have led to current reading sounds in Korean, which makes the Chinese character ‘cha’ selectively pronounced as ‘dha’ or ‘cha’. According to Jineonjip (Mantras) in Korean, the reading sound of the Chinese character ‘cha’ was listed as ‘dha’ in Korean. This may have led to the current reading sound rule of ‘charye’ being occasionally called ‘darye’."

As the Constitution did not name any adjacent islands or suggest any criteria for determining them, Ulreung Island, Dokdo, Parangdo and Tsushima drew political attention at this point during early years of Korean Government. Japan wanted to retain Ulreung Island as her territory, but Allied Powers, including the U.S., had firm position that it should belong to Korea. Korea asked Japan return Tsushima back, but the U.S. paid no heed to Korean claim. Korean Government tried to specify Parangdo as Korean territory in the San Francisco Peace Treaty, but it was not real island at all. Though Dokdo has been under control of Korean Government, Japan continued to insist her territorial claim over Dokdo."

The Korea Meteorological Administration is using automatic weather observation equipment and radar to collect data for estimating high-resolution precipitation. This study is dealt with estimates of the quantitative precipitation using multiple spatial interpolation methods and compares the results. Inverse distance weight method and k-nearest neighborhood algorithm were considered as a deterministic approach and the general additive model and kriging methods were used as a stochastic approach. In order to evaluate the prediction performance, leave-one- out cross-validation was performed with the root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean bias. The gauged and radar data during the summer season from 2016 to 2018 in Seoul were used. The results showed that the inverse distance weight method reflected the spatial rainfall pattern well. However, caution is needed because the best models vary depending on the pattern of rainfall in the sense of RMSE."

Dick’s Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and Ubik in terms of religious storytelling. In these works, Dick presents the religious visions of “Mercerism” and “Ubik” for human salvation in the post-apocalyptic entropy world. Based on empathy, Mercerism dissolves the rigid thinking of traditional religion that emphasizes the extreme confrontation between good and evil and it represents the ability to declare one’s own salvation through communal sharing of experiences. In addition, the possibility of salvation is presented through “Ubik” confirmed by Logos. Dick shows us that divinity can be found not only in holy churches and sanctuaries, but also in surroundings and everyday life. Dick further suggests that the meaning of religion is not only a matter of faith, but also an ultimate belief that realizes the value of human existence and community."
Space‑Vector‑Based Hybrid PWM for Zero‑Sequence‑Circulating‑Current RMS and Common Mode Voltage Reduction in Two Parallel Interleaved Two‑Level Converters,2020,['Paralleled interleaved three-phase inverter · Zero-sequence-circulating current (ZSCC) · Root mean square (RMS) · Common mode voltage (CMV) · Hybrid space vector modulation (HBSVM)'],,"This paper aims at reducing the root mean square (RMS) values of the zero-sequence circulating current (ZSCC). The analysis reveals that the ZSCC is determined by the duty ratios of the medium voltage vector and zero vector. Whereas the reference voltage fxes the duty ratio of the medium vector, the duty ratio of the zero-voltage vector depends on the distribution of the small and larger vectors, which can be used to optimize the ZSCC. As such, we propose a generalized PWM architecture, where the distribution of the active vectors is parameterized by a coefcient k. Based on this, we derive regions for k that attain the same minimal ZSCC peak. Within these regions, we further optimize k to minimize the ZSCC RMS. Depending on the reference voltage, the method selects diferent coefcient k for the ZSCC RMS optimizations. The proposed modulation strategy is therefore a HBSVM due to its adaptive feature in the distribution of the active vectors. The proposed HBSVM uniformly applies to the entire vector plane and is computationally afordable for mainstream microcontrollers. Finally, the experimental results validate the merits of the proposed method."

It is well known that this flow is naturally unstable due to the Karman vortex shedding and exhibits a complex flow structure in the wake region. The mean flow field including velocity profiles and the dominant frequency of flow oscillation that was from the simulations discussed earlier were compared with the experimental data observed by Wang et al. (2004; 2006). Based on these comparisons it was found that the v2-f model is most accurate for the URANS simulation; moreover, the k-ω model is also acceptable. However, the k-ε model was found to be unsuitable in this case. Therefore, v2-f model is proved to be an excellent choice for the analysis of flow with massive separation. Therefore, it is expected to be used in future by studies aiming to control the flow separation."

The issue is where the foundation of their formal structure is. For the solution to this, researchers focus on two views. One is the view that the Pauline Epistles are based on ancient letter writing. The other is one that they are base on rhetorical form.In this paper I support that the formal structure of the Pauline Epistles is within the category of rhetoric. That they are within the category of rhetoric means that Paul wrote his letters as the speeches. Therefore, they follow rhetorical rules. The basis that they can be regarded as a category of rhetoric lies in the speeches they were sent to the group/the community in. When we compare ancient letters written on papyri with the Pauline Epistles, this fact become much more apparent. Ancient letters are for an individual or a few persons whereas a subject of the Pauline Epistles is the group/the community, which evinces the fact that they belong to rhetorical category.The basis that they are in rhetorical category is found through rhetorical evidence. That they are for brothers, verbal speeches, and have equal authority with speaking makes sure that the Pauline Epistles are in rhetorical category.Buddhist kōan as a Girardian simulation of crisis can be compared with stichomythia in Greek tragedy as verbal contests. For Girard, if the art of Greek tragedy is to be defined in a single phrase, we might call attention to one of its most characteristic traits: the opposition of symmetrical elements. There is no aspect of the plot, form, or language of a tragedy in which this symmetrical pattern does not recur. The core of the drama is that the two protagonists exchange insults and accusations with increasing earnestness and rapidity. The Greek public is brought to these “verbal contests.” The symmetry of the tragic dialogue is perfectly mirrored by the stichomythia, in which the two protagonists address one another in alternating lines. Stichomythia is particularly well suited to sections of dramatic dialogue where two characters are in violent dispute. The rhythmic intensity of the alternating lines combined with quick, biting ripostes in the dialogue can be quite powerful. In tragic dialogue hot words, as Girard puts it, are substituted for cold steel. But whether the violence is physical or verbal, the suspense remains the same. The adversaries match blow for blow, and they seem so evenly matched that it is impossible to predict the outcome of the battle.The agonistic or conflictual nature of verbal contest is a typical element of the Buddhist kōan. Kōan as a kind of verbal contest can be understood as a simulacrum of crisis within the context of Buddhist initiation. The agonistic or conflictual nature of Chan dialogues, sometimes called Dharma battles,has often been pointed out, but it is usually downplayed as a ‘skillful means’ used by master to test and awaken his disciple. Clearly, this interpretation, for Faure, cannot simply be taked for granted in the case of those masters whom Linji called “blind shavepates and wild foxes.” Quite possibly, many of them were symbolically, socially, or psychologically empowered by their (symmetrical) confrontations with novices. This encounter produces a winner and a loser; and the gain and the loss are very real: like the ‘deadly words’ of witchcraft, the dialogue seems to activate quasi-magical forces. Mon-dō(question-answer)is verbal battle(Wortgefecht)between master and disciple.But this violent, agonistic or conflictual nature of Chan dialogues, language game was sometimes misunderstood in the sense of playful quality of language. These violent methods of linguistic simulation of the sacrificial crisis within the context of Buddhist initiation are to be understood as representing a (initiatory) play of differentiation and undifferentiation in Girardian sense. For Girard, great theater is necessarily “a play of differentiation and undifferentiation.” Buddhist (no)-theater and ritual process of (initiatory) meditation can be also considered in this sense. Girard subordinates play to religion, and in particular to the sacrificial crisis. Play has a religious origin, to be sure, for Girard, insofar as it reproduces certain aspects of the sacrificial crisis."

In the ‘old Tokyo before new Tokyo’, ‘new Tokyo’ means the great Tokyo which was transformed into the metropolis. The stage of ‘For Half a Year’ is Tokyo before such transformation. For considering such division, it is required to thoroughly read the space in the novel on the basis of history, culture and geology of Tokyo. With critical mind on it, this paper carefully examined the space in the novel by Park, Tae-won related to Tokyo using the map before 1930s. It aims to understand the map of Park, Tae-won’s awareness on Tokyo on the basis of the relation between spaces in each novel. As a result, it was found that Park, Tae-won were not indulged only into the center of ideology led by Tokyo, the capital city of Japanese empire. In such tug-of-war, Park, Tae-won focused on the dark world in Tokyo, the periphery in Tokyo. The dark world means Sumida river area in Three-day Starving Spring Moon and The Miserable and Tokyo apartment in Travail. Through the dark world, he showed the space for life of the lower classes in Tokyo. As paying attention to the peripheral space not the mainstream place of institutional ideology, he could draw the differentiated Tokyo. His interest on the suburbs was originated from that dark world. Denying and dismissing the center of Tokyo enabled to pay attention to suburbs. Bangranjang, the cafe in Koenji, was created by the spirit of denial on the center of Tokyo. While it’s the place in imagination, it’s meaningful on the aspect that it’s the different space raising the question on the center of Tokyo. Park, Tae-won said that he felt overwhelmed by Hongo where there was Daiichi High School and Imperial University when he arrived in Japan for the first time. But he was not ultimately intimidated by keeping a certain distance from such space. Through the center concept, this paper secured the viewpoints of Park, Tae-won on Tokyo as the artist. It’s the result from his sense of identity as the writer or artist that he could imagine the spaces in suburbs out of the center and the dark side of the city. While he was the artist in the colony, he was ultimately the artist. His novels related to Tokyo indicate his position as described above."

However, if fire accidents that cause critical losses can be forecasted, it can expect to minimize losses through preemptive action. Classifications using machine learning were determined as appropriate classification criteria for the forecasting cause it classified as a constant damage scale and proportion. In addition, the analysis of the periodicity of a critical fire accident showed a certain pattern, but showed a high deviation. So it seems possible to forecast critical fire accidents using advanced prediction techniques rather than simple prediction techniques."

Sajasangsung(師資相承) is a way of designating successor of Dharma transmission between a teacher and a disciple in Buddhism. It has been the way of traditional designating of successor in Korean Buddhism.  In the Zen master lineage, the objects of this study are the ‘secret transmission’ (密嗣) of Hyujǔng(休靜) and ‘Dharma Teaching in dream’(夢中法門) of Hyobong (曉峰). In the Ordination master lineage, the object of this article is Sǒsangsugye (瑞祥受戒) of Daeǔnnango(大隱朗旿) and Kǔmdambomyǒng (金潭普明). In the Buddhist Scripture Teaching master lineage, Wupaekundang(位牌建幢, becoming the disciple of the teacher who was passed away in front of the mortuary tablet) of Myungsǒng is chosen for this study.  Although Hyobong is the successor of the Taegobowu(太古普愚) lineage, after getting Dharma teaching in his dream, he asserted he would be the successor of Jinǔl’s lineage and his thought would follow Jǒnghyessangsu(定慧雙修). Kǔmdambomyǒng was the teacher of Daeǔnnango, but he volunteered to be the successor of his disciple Daeǔnnango after experiencing Sǒsangsugye that had happened to Daeǔnnango. Myungsǒng became the successor of Suok in front of her memorial tablet.  The reason that I focus on the way of bridging the gap is that it may make us reinterpret the tradition creatively. Especially I figured out that the attitude of self-determination played the important role in the process of bridging.  I am interested in this attitude, self-determination and finding creative ways of recovering the lineage. Because it can give us an inspiration. Korean Buddhism which has faced a lot of problems can be inspired from it."

It is well known that this flow is naturally unstable due to the Karman vortex shedding and exhibits a complex flow structure in the wake region. The mean flow field including velocity profiles and the dominant frequency of flow oscillation that was from the simulations discussed earlier were compared with the experimental data observed by Wang et al.

Chakpŏp kwigam) book published in 1827, the arguments of Paekp’a Kŭngsŏn(白坡亘璇, 1767-1852)’s ten wholesome precepts 十善戒 and the preceptive tendencies or significance contained therein. Looking at the Paragon of Rules on Conduct, Paekp’a is greatly disheartened by the collapse of the traditional Buddhist monk aqueduct consciousness at the time and the confusion of the denomination resulting from this, and seeks to improve this confusion through the ten wholesome precepts accompanied by true repentance. It is believed that the ten wholesome precepts can promote the inner improvement of the monks in that it is a system that can control the defilements of the bodily actions, speech, and thought, especially the ‘thought 意’. Originally, as Four Part Vinaya 四分律, it is the traditional method to receive bhikṣu ordination, so it is argued that it is not in accordance with the aquatic tradition that only the ten wholesome precepts can be received. However, Paekp’a has given important meaning to the ten wholesome precepts by faithfully following the traditions such as the Yogâcāra precepts and Jinpyo 眞表’s repentance practice, which have had a great influence on the commandment tradition of Korean Buddhism. In addition, from the standpoint of the determination of self-purity, the ten wholesome precepts is positioned within the three categories of pure precepts 三聚淨戒, so that the monks naturally grasp the pure nature of their own, so that they naturally leave evil and develop the good, and furthermore, they take an independent position to provide relief for rebirth. By adding them, bhikṣu has established itself as the ultimate commandment that can complete the bodhisattva practice."

K시 4년제 대학교 유아교육과 학생 1~4학년 예비교사 121명을 대상으로 자기인식 설문조사를 통해 기술통계 분석을 하였다. 또한 저널쓰기와 성찰일지, 심층적인 인터뷰 자료를 수집하여 질적연구방법인 내용분석방법을 하였다. 연구결과, 첫째, 예비교사들의 자기인식은 대부분 보통수준 이상으로 높게 나타났다. 둘째, 예비교사의 현재적 행복의 의미수준은 ‘목표나 꿈이 있어서 많이 행복해요=행복×행복’, ‘사람들과 함께 잘 지내서 조금 행복해요=행복+행복’, ‘바쁘고 힘들어서 조금 행복하지 않아요=행복－행복’, ‘스트레스가 많아 행복하지 않아요=행복÷행복’ 4개의 의미가 있었다. 이러한 결과는 예비교사의 행복을 위해 자기인식이 분명하고 주체적인 측면을 강화하는 예비교사교육이나 상담지도가 필요함을 시사한다. 행복은 타자와 비교하는 삶이 아니라, 자신이 원하는 것을 위해 어려운 역경을 극복할 수 있는 능력을 기르는 것이 중요하며, 이를 위해서는 세상 즉 타인과 거리두기와 같은 동떨어진 시선으로부터 자아를 찾는 것에서 출발해야 할 것이다.","This study was to specifically examine the level of awareness on happiness held by the pre-service teachers. Journal writing, reflection diaries, and in-depth interviews were made with 121 pre-service early childhood teachers in order to examine the meaning of happiness of pre-service early childhood teachers. Descriptive statistics as well as qualitative analysis was used. As a result, first, the awareness of pre-service early childhood teachers was mostly higher than the average level. Second, four meanings of happiness were found : ‘I am very happy because I have a goal or dream = happiness × happiness'; 'I am a little happy because I am well with people = happiness + happiness'; 'I am not happy because I am busy and tired = happiness-happiness'; 'I'm not very happy with stress = happiness ÷ happiness'. This suggests that pre-service teacher education or counseling guidance be focused more on promoting self-awareness and subjective aspects. Happiness is not about a life of comparison with others, It is important to cultivate the ability to overcome difficult adversities for what you want, and to do this, you must start with seeing your self from a distant gaze, such as evaluating yourself not by others’ standard."

Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale version 1.1, Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, and K-BDEFS were used. The control subjects were 144 age, sex, and education-matched general adults who participated in the study of the validity of the K-BDEFS in Samsung Medical Center.Results An analysis of the mean total K-BDEFS score, executive functioning symptom count, and ADHD-executive function (EF) index score revealed a significant difference between the adult ADHD and control group (p<0.05). Five subscales of the K-BDEFS, which assess the specific domains of the executive function, revealed a significant difference between the ADHD group and control group (p<0.05). The area under curve (AUC) of the K-BDEFS total score, the EF symptom count, and the ADHD-EF index were 0.943, 0.949, and 0.908, respectively, in the analysis using the receiver operating characteristic curve. All AUC values were over 0.90. Therefore, KBDEFS is a reliable and valid screening instrument for diagnosing adult ADHD. In an assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of the cutoff scores, a cutoff of 183.5 points for the K-BDEFS total score, 26.5 points for the EF symptom count, and 23.5 points for the ADHD-EF index showed a reliable sensitivity and specificity above 80%.Conclusion To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to examine the predictive validity and clinical utility of K-BDEFS in adult ADHD. The results suggest that the K-BDEFS could be used as a valid and reliable tool for the diagnosis and clinical intervention of adult ADHD."

The ANN and ANFIS models yielded similar performances, based on four different statistical indices (i.e., root mean squared error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), correlation coefficient (R), and peak flow criteria (PFC)) for training and testing phases. The values of RMSE and PFC for the WNN model (e.g., RMSE = 8.590 m3/sec, PFC = 0.252 for (t+1) day, testing phase) were lower than those of ANN (e.g., RMSE = 19.120 m3/sec, PFC = 0.446 for (t+1) day, testing phase) and ANFIS (e.g., RMSE = 18.520 m3/sec, PFC = 0.444 for (t+1) day, testing phase) models, while the values of NSE and R for WNN model were higher than those of ANNs and ANFIS models. Therefore, the new approach can be a robust tool for multi-step (days) streamflow forecasting in the Seybous River, Algeria."

Dadurch hat sie die Zusammenhänge und Wechselwirkungen zwischen den Bereichen und ein wichtiges Bedeutungselement gefunden, das auf der anfänglichen Ebene des Inputs nicht vorhanden ist, sondern erst im Blend-Bereich neu hervortritt. Sie bezeichnet es als ‘emergent meaning’ und sein erzeugendes Vermögen als ‘creativity’. Die Bezeichnung ruft den Eindruck hervor, als könne die Metapher eine neue Bedeutung ‘schaffen’. Aber in Wirklichkeit ist im metaphorischen Prozess gar keine neue Bedeutung zu schaffen, sondern nur ‘the new centrality on the extreme wide horizont of encyclopaedic knowledge’ zu finden. Wenn man den Horizont der möglichen enzyklpädischen Bedeutungszusammenhänge unendlich erweitert, tritt nicht automatisch eine neue Bedeutung hervor, sondern vielmehr die Grenze zur Sinnlosigkeit oder zum Schweigen.Dies wird im vorliegenden Aufsatz am Beispiel von Rainer Maria Rilkes Liebeslied, Georg Trakls Rondel und Paul Celans Psalm im Einzelnen dargestellt.An diesen Ergebnissen ist zu erkennen, dass die kognitive Metaphernlehre einen nicht zu kleinen Fortschritt im Zusammenhang mit den Entstehungsund Wirkungsprozessen der Metapher geleistet, aber im Grunde über die bisherigen Lehren nicht so weit überschritten hat."

Forming part of the Ancient School (rnying ma), Dzogchen boasts a contemplative system in which practices are said to be effortless and liberation consists solely in the revelation of our already perfected Buddha-nature. This contribution focuses on controversial ideas such as this, and explores their origin, their place within the world of Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, and their underlying mode of functioning. As for the origin of the Dzogchen teachings, this paper argues that they must be located in two collective traumas that affected the founders of the Ancient School during the tradition’s formative years, namely the collapse of the Tibetan empire (ninth century CE) and the marginalization suffered after the rise of the New Schools (gsar ma) in the subsequent centuries. As for the tradition’s position within the religious landscape of the Himalayas, it should not only be explored in relationship to other “crisis cults,” such as the Kālacakra Tantra that emerged during the advent of Muslim rule in India, but also to the treasure tradition (gter ma). Finally, this study explores the key underlying functioning of the doctrine of effortless enlightenment by means of the concept of the “ground” (gzhi / sa), which is central to both Dzogchen and Terma. Reading the Dzogchen myth of the “epiphany of the ground” side by side with accounts of how “earth treasures” (sa gter) are unearthed out of the Tibetan soil, the paper shows that the ground was fundamental to the success of Nyingmapa Buddhism. By allowing its adherents to infuse the present with past energy, the repetition of old narratives with innovative meanings, and the attitude of receptivity with agency, the mythicalhistorical ground of the Ancient School is not only a means to overcome its collective traumas, but also laid the foundation for the teaching of effortless enlightenment that marks the tradition until today."

The Jungwon Goguryeo Stele(중원고구려비), which is relatively more characteristic of the Idu writing system, offers a glimpse of the potential existence of the Hundok reading system without nonetheless providing any conclusive evidence. The passage on Goguryeo’s place names in the Volume 37 of secondary source Samguk sagi gives two equivalent names, ‘鉛 (lead): 乃勿 [na-mɨl]’ and ‘城 (castle): 忽 [hol]’, for the castle situated on the north bank of Amnokgang(Yalu river). On the basis of this equivalence, it can be conjectured that the Hundok reading system existed in Goguryeo prior to the 7th century. General Yeon Gaesomun, written ‘淵蓋蘇文’ in Hanja, is transliterated by ‘伊梨柯須彌’ [iri kasumi] in Nihon Shoki. This means that the Hundok reading system was used in 7th-century Goguryeo, which was then marked by the activities of General Yeon Gaesomun. However, the inscription on the Gwanggaeto Stele(광개토대왕비문) shows a good command of Chinese characters as early as the beginning of the 4th century, which seems to suggest that the Hundok system might have already existed in Goguryeo at that time. Nonetheless, clear evidence has yet to be found in the materials of that period.Based on the historical data on Baekje, the existence of the Hundok reading system is suggested by the name ‘猪耳’ (pig’s ears) inscribed on a wooden tablet excavated from the Buyeo Neungsanri Temple site(부여능산리사지목간), which is estimated to date back to early 6th century. From the native Baekje translation of ‘猪耳’, that is, [toskui/tothkui] (돗귀/돝귀), it can be supposed that the Hundok reading system existed in early 6th-century Baekje. Citing Baekje Sinchan (百濟新撰), which is a book on the history of Baekje, secondary source Nihon Shoki mentions that King Muryeong(462~523) was named ‘斯麻’[sima] because he was born on an island and ‘斯麻’ could be written ‘嶋君’(island-born man) in Hanja. The equivalence between the Hanja character ‘嶋’(island) and the Baekje word ‘斯麻’ shows evidence for the use of Hundok. It can be concluded from this example that the Hundok reading system existed from King Muryeong’s reign (i.e. 6th century) onwards.Among the historical data for Silla, we can mention ‘波珎’[*patɔr](海) inscribed on the 6th-century epigraphs of the Uljoo Cheonjeon-ri Second Inscription(울주천전리추명, 525) and the Danyang Jeokseong Stele(단양적성비, 540), wherein the character ‘珍’ can be read as [tɔr](* 돌). The equivalence between ‘石(stone): 珍[tɔr]: 突[tor]’ which appears in Baekje’s place names also proves that ‘珍’ was read as [tɔr]. While it is certain that ‘珍’ was read as [tɔr/tΛr](돌/□), more evidence is required to prove that it is indeed a Hundok reading. The inscriptions ‘文作人’ and ‘文尺’ on the Tag-Gu Musul Ojak Stele(대구 무술오작비) and the Namsan Sinseong Stele(남산신성비) respectively might have been read as [kɨlja(h)](글자(ㅎ)), but this remains inconclusive. However, the coexistence of the inscriptions ‘韓舍’ [hansa] and ‘韓奈麻’ [hannama] on the 8th-century Gilt Bronze Reliquary of the Hwangboksa Pagoda(황복사석탑금동사리함명, 706), as well as that of ‘大舍’[dεsa] and ‘韓舍’ [hansa] on the Hwaeom-gyeong Copy(화엄경사경조성기, 755) constitute compelling evidence that ‘大’ was read [han] (한). Thus, it can be confirmed that the Hundok system had existed in Silla from early 8th century or just before it. The character ‘白’ from the 7th-century Wooden Tablet no.149 of Wolseong Moat(월성해자목간149호) may have been read according to the Hundok reading system but it is also correct to understand it according to the original meaning of this Hanja, i.e. [saroida](사뢰다, to tell honorific). The character ‘在’ [kjə], however, was written according to the Idu script and, therefore, can be seen as a Hundok character. Although SamgukYusa remains a secondary source material, it is recorded that Won-hyo(617~686) was designated by his contemporaries with the Silla name ‘始旦’(seol 설), which shows that the Hundok reading system existed in mid-7th-century Silla."

World Art Glossary defines the art of writing beautifully, broadly generally non-letter typeface, or narrowly calligraphy. When translated from English, calligraphy is called ‘calligraphy’. In the Orient, traditional calligraphy means calligraphy. Since the mid-1990s, the term calligraphy no longer refers to calligraphy. Calligraphy is currently used in advertising, publishing, and performance. Using the title of the product as a calligraphy, and with the popularity of calligraphy, the enthusiasm for calligraphy has increased. Application for Calligraphic Trademarks In 2008, more than 14,000 applications were registered with the Patent Office. The cover of the book consists of calligraphy more than 50% of the 300 rankings according to the domestic novel sales volume from January 2003 to September 2005. In the case of movie posters, more than 60 films released in the first half of 2017 were used as calligraphy. Education status includes calligraphy companies, private calligraphy studios, lifelong education centers, libraries, department store culture centers, mart culture centers, vocational training centers, elementary, middle and high school classes, community centers, women s halls, education and cultural centers, etc. Calligraphy training is taking place. More than 300 cases of calligraphy have been registered for civilian certification since 2020. Calligraphy-related books have grown rapidly since 2013, starting in 1992, and about 250 books have been published as of 2020. More than 250 dissertation-related dissertations and more than 220 domestic journals were able to confirm the spread of calligraphy. Also, a calligraphy competition was created with a squirt. But the proliferation of calligraphy has caused a number of problems. Calligraphy similar to the indiscriminate use of calligraphy obscures the uniqueness of calligraphy, which has been distinguished from typefaces. The appearance of the calligraphy was enlarged, but the quality declined. Increasingly, the works violated the character of calligraphy, the character, and made it less readable. Qualitative decline is a problem for the curriculum. It is a low-cost tuition and consists of about 8 to 15 lessons per step. Compared to the calligraphy curriculum, the calligraphy curriculum is poor. It is often the case that classes are omitted without basic font features and theories. In this curriculum, the process of repeating the qualifications of those who got the certificate as an educator was repeated. Such a process is causing a decline in calligraphy, which causes a decline in the quality of calligraphy. Calligraphy s institutional method of education has led to similar calligraphy work, and the side effects of loss of uniqueness by mass production of works that do not meet the concepts of calligraphy and loss of uniqueness by those who do not master the basics of calligraphy. It was. The proliferation of calligraphy has certainly created a culture that represents this era, but the problems in the process remain a challenge to be solved and solved at the present time."

Environmental disturbances such as wind and waves are always present under real sea conditions, however, so it is impossible to accurately estimate delivered horsepower under ideal conditions. These disruptive influences also make it difficult to evaluate the positive effect of recently developed energy-saving devices. In this study, uncertainty analysis of improved speed performance was carried out using Monte Carlo simulation to confirm the energy-saving efficiency of a ship equipped with an air-lubrication system. The findings showed the average power saving to be 3.2%, with the expanded uncertainty of ± 2.7% at a 95% confidence level (k=2)."

Today, nail art, a field of art maximizing beauty, is highlighted as one of the highest-value-added industries. As the number of women in the workforce rises, people’s interest in various nail design has increased. In fact, nail art has gradually evolved into an element used to improve the degree of perfection in styling. The scope of nail art has been expanded to the means of value expression, which represents the degree of self-management and confidence, and it has become more important. As Albrecht Durer (1471-1524) attempted to express his new awareness on pride and self-consciousness through hands in self-portraits, hands themselves can represent who we are as a person. Under the cultural phenomena of hallyu (popularity of Korean pop culture), there have been more opportunities to introduce Korean culture to the world. Accordingly, there has been a necessity to have traditional Korean nail art in the K-beauty industry as well. To reduce the closeness of the ‘full coat’ and maintain the retention of gel nail, this study proposed space nail art. In addition, this study tried to establish theoretical grounds through related books, literature records and various web sites to analyze space nail, which as yet has not been greatly studied. This study is also aimed to propose differentiated nail art in customers’ aesthetic needs and the unlimited possibility in the development of nail art materials."

K-IFRS “Fair value measurement” prioritizes the source of information used in fair value measurements into three levels: (1) Level 1 (observable inputs from quoted prices in active markets), (2) Level 2 (indirectly observable inputs form quoted prices of comparable items in active markets identical items in inactive markets, or other market-related information), and (3) Level 3 (unobservable, firm-generated inputs). K-IFRS requires fair value assets and liabilities to be disclosed by these levels. When there are no observable market prices entity estimates fair value using a valuation method(Level 3 inputs), the auditor is required to exert additional effort to understand management's rationale for selecting the method, whether the method is appropriate, whether the method is applied consistently. In this situation, the period from the end of the accounting period to audit report date(audit report lag) would increase because auditor collects sufficient audit evidence to reduce the audit risk.This study conducts empirical analysis using listed companies from 2014 to 2018, and the results are as follows. First, the proportions of fair value assets using level 3 inputs are positively associated with audit report lag (closing day of fiscal year∼audit report day). This result means that auditor considers the opaqueness of financial assets measured at Level 3, and invests more time and effort to the audit procedure. Second, audit report lag is shorter for firms with long auditor tenure especially Level 3 fair values. This results highlight the importance of auditor tenure in mitigating intrinsic measurement error associated with Level 3 inputs. Third, Level 3 fair values are positively related to audit fees and audit hours. Fourth, Level 3 fair values are positively associated with the realization rate of audit engagements. This result suggests that auditor receives higher risk premium for client with more Level 3 fair values, which leads to a higher profitability from the audit engagement.This study makes an important contribution in that it is the first study to examine the effect of fair value hierarchy information on audit report lag. Also this paper extends prior studies on audit fees and audit hours by focusing on the measurement of audit profitability, a realization rate."

One of the clues of the forgery is its writing style. Unlike other works of Jingying Huiyuan, the Jingyingshu contains unpolished sentences throughout the text. However, I argue that it is not so much a question since the early version of Jingying Huiyuan’s writings shows the same problem as well.2) The Jingyingshu interprets the term Kāya-traya thorugh the classification of the Ti(體), Xiang(相) and Yong(用). These three terms are identified with the Dharmakāya, the Saṃbhogakāya and the Nirmāṇakāya respectively. This way of interpretation is the original scheme of the Dilun School.3) The Jingyingshu quotes his another writing “The Meaning of the Two Hindrances(二障義)” in almost full length when explaining the defilement theory of the Awakening the Mahāyāna Faith. The previous research asserted that this quotation shows no consistency and pointed it as the decisive evidence of the apocryphalness of the Jingyingshu. However, as far as I can see, the Jingyingshu choose the most relevant analytics on the matter.In conclusion, the Jingyingshu can be regarded as a commentary written under the doctrinal influence of the Jingying Huiyan, if not composed by himself."

Founded by Gerd B. Achenbach in 1981, today’s philosophical counseling inherits the traditional philosophical counseling. In the philosophical counseling, the philosophy itself is considered a therapeutic discourse for the disease of the soul. The object of philosophical counseling as doing philosophy is to cure for the soul. In particular, K. Jaspers and V. Frankl are pioneers in the field of philosophical counseling that treats the philosophical disease as disease of the mind in a modern point of view in accordance with traditions of ancient philosophers. Jaspers’ elucidation of existence and Frankl’s elucidation of meaning are attempt to overcome limitations of the psychoanalysis in Freud and the traditional psychotherapy. The elucidation of existence and the elucidation of meaning effectively focus on the existential anthropology in high-level psychology in order to go beyond Freud’s deep psychology. The elucidation of existence is not only to let a client who is facing a borderline situation or an existential stranding of his or her life approach his or her existence, but also to encourage a client to reveal the original existence by elucidating his or her existence in a free choice. On the other hand, the elucidation of meaning is to help a client who is suffering from the existential vacuum due to frustration or meaninglessness or loss of meaning by elucidating the meaning of his or her own life. In this regard, the philosophical counseling is a philosophical practice led by a philosophical counselor to overcome the problem of mental suffering by elucidating a client’s his or her existence or meaning of life. In particular, Frankl’s elucidation of meaning is based on the elucidation of existence invented by Jaspers, so if these two elucidations work in complementary ways, they will serve as an exemplary example for modern people’s mental suffering, namely, the existential stranding(Jaspers) or the existential vacuum(Frankl) in the horizon of philosophical counseling.

It is assumed that this phenomenon may be occurred due to adopting advanced expected loss model resulting in inadequacy of the recognition of future credit risk as Cohen and Edwards(2017) argued. Accordingly, this study analyzes empirically whether provision for bad debt may realize correctly on future credit risk. Non performing loan ratio(NPL) at absolute level as well as NPL gap which means the difference between NPL ratio on average and real NPL ratio are used as the proxy variable of future credit risk. Main results are as follows. First, real provision to required provision for bad debt does not recognize the future credit risk because the level of NPL or the NPL gap is negative or positive to future credit risk, respectively. These results are line with the arguments of Cohen and Edwards(2017), Simper, Dadoukis, and Bryce(2019). Second, it is found that the relationship between market interest rate and future credit risk is positive. The possibility of uprising future credit risk is low in that repayment capacity of borrower may be increased under low interest rate trend. As a result, reasonable adjustment of provision is required because recognition of future credit risk level is overestimated. As Kim(2017) and Lee(2019) are argued that adequacy of provision in Korean banks is required, the standard on setting up provision in credit card firm should be reconsidered."

The purpose is to verify the effectiveness of the SSWB model through comparative analysis before and after implementation of the program.[Methodology] The study was conducted in the fall semester of 2019 on 110 students of responsible management, management ethics, and leadership at K and S universities in Seoul where researchers work. For this study, pretest－posttest was conducted using the ‘Management Wisdom’ measurement tool developed by the researcher, and the analysis and verification were conducted using SPSS 25.[Findings] As a result, all factors resulted in statistically significant results. In other words, the SSWB model can be interpreted as improving the level of management wisdom. Therefore, it has been verified that this is a useful program for learning the wisdom of managers.[Implications] This study is significant in that the research related to learning wisdom has been limited to qualitative research through interview or through ideological reasoning so far, while actual quantitative measurement has been attempted. Moreover, the significance of the program can be found in the fact that the researchers who have conceptualized the wisdom of managers and developed measurement tools and programs for the first time in Korea have personally verified the effectiveness of the program. This means that the direction and flow of research are consistent, as well as the context of the same subject can be brought together to be faithful to the exact nature of the study. Also, the possibility of learning wisdom has been justified. This is of great significance not only in the academic entry of wisdom, which was considered abstract, but also in the fact that it was the trigger for practical college entrance."

X-선 회절실험으로 VO2 박막은 결정성이 우수함을 알 수 있었고표면형상 측정으로 표면 거칠기가 0.58 nm – 1.08 nm 정도임을 확인하였다. VO2 박막은 약 325 – 350 K 사이에서 금속-부도체 상전이를 보였다. 그리고 스퍼터링 (DC sputtering) 방법을 이용하여 VO2 박막 위에 수직 자기이방성을 갖는 Co/Pt 다층박막을 제작하고 자기-광 커 효과 측정을 통하여 Co/Pt 박막은 뚜렷한 수직 자기이방성을 가짐을 확인하였다. 구조적 상전이를 함에도 불구하고 (100) VO2 는평면 내에서 두 격자상수의 변형 효과가 상쇄되는 경향을 갖기 때문에 (100) VO2 와 결합된 Co/Pt 박막의보자력은 VO2 와 결합되지 않은 Co/Pt 박막과 비슷한 형태의 온도 의존성을 보였다. 반면, (101) VO2 는 이웃한 Co/Pt 박막에 알짜 경계면 변형력을 제공하기 때문에 자기탄성효과에 의해 보자력이 증가된 것으로 생각된다. 보자력은 자화용이축 방향으로 구조적 상전이 온도 근처에서 최대 약 5 Oe, 자화어려움축방향으로 약 200 Oe 정도 증가되는 것으로 보였다.","Fifty-nanometer thick (100) and (101) VO2 films were synthesized on C-plane and R-plane Al2O3 substrates using pulsed laser deposition. X-ray diffraction measurements suggested that the VO2 films with a root-mean-square roughness of 0.58 – 1.08 nm had good crystalline properties. The temperature dependence of the resistance for the VO2 films displayed a metal-insulator transition behavior at TMI= 325 – 350 K. Co/Pt multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy were deposited on (100) and (101) VO2 film by using DC sputtering, and their magnetic properties were monitored by using magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements. Although the VO2 has a structural transition from monoclinic to tetragonal at the TMI, the (100) VO2 plane seems to have opposite changes in the two in-plane lattice constants, so no net strain is induced in the neighboring Co/Pt film. On the other hand, the (101) VO2 with net changes in both in-plane lattice constants at the TMI presumably provides interfacial stress to the neighboring Co/Pt film thus, it induces a net magnetoelastic effect, which results in an increases in the coercive fields of 5 Oe along the easy axis and 200 Oe along the hard axis."

Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to derive subgroups of patients who experienced similar patterns of sleep-related problems and nocturnal disabilities.Results The total K-PDSS-2 score was 11.67±9.87 (mean±standard deviation) at baseline and 12.61±11.17 at the retest. Cronbach’s α coefficients of the total K-PDSS-2 scores at baseline and follow-up were 0.851 and 0.880, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficients over the 2-week study period ranged from 0.672 to 0.848. The total K-PDSS-2 score was strongly correlated with health-related quality of life measures and other corresponding nonmotor scales.LCA revealed three distinct subtypes of sleep disturbance in the study patients: “less-troubled sleepers,” “PD-related nocturnal difficulties,” and “disturbed sleepers.” Conclusions K-PDSS-2 showed good clinimetric attributes in accordance with previous studies that employed the original version of the PDSS-2, therefore confirming the cross-cultural usefulness of the scale. This study has further documented the first application of an LCA approach for identifying subtypes of sleep disturbance in patients with PD."

A total of 71,114,562 reads of 20x coverage for the K. paniculata genome were generated and assembled to 141,924 contigs of a minimum of 500 bp long. One hundred seventy-nine of the 79,633 contigs containing microsatellite regions were used for primer design. Fourteen primer sets were selected as polymorphic markers by applying them to three K. paniculata populations, designated as natural monuments in Korea. Somewhat low levels of genetic diversity were observed. The grand means of the number of alleles, observed heterozygosity, and expected heterozygosity were 2.7, 0.493, and 0.407, respectively. Analysis of molecular variance indicated a high level of genetic differentiation among populations. Distinct patterns of three populations were identified in the principal coordinate analysis and Bayesian structure analysis. The probability of identity of these markers was estimated to be quite low, suggesting that these markers have the robust potential power to distinguish genetically different individuals. K. paniculata has a high economic value as an ornamental tree, and a honey tree. The novel microsatellite markers developed in this study will be useful for future breeding programs and genetic studies aimed at developing conservation plans."

SAFE는 자금 조달 시 가치평가 상한액 등 최소한의 요건만 정하고 기업가치 산정을 후속투자로 연기함으로써 기업가치 과대평가 문제를 완화하고, 크라우드펀딩 시장 활성화에도 기여할 것으로 보인다. 하지만 SAFE는 일반투자자를 고려하여 고안된 것이 아니기 때문에 국내 도입 시 투자자 보호를 고려해야 한다. 첫째, 후속 투자 정의를 명확히 규정하여 발행기업의 의도적인 주식 전환 지연을 방지해야 한다. 둘째, SAFE의 주식 전환 및 투자금 회수 요건에 재무적 요건을 포함하여 기업의 현금흐름이 좋음에도 불구하고 주식 전환을 못하는 것을 방지해야 한다. 셋째, SAFE 발행기업 범위를 규정하여 경영권 간섭을 회피하기 위한 자금 조달 수단으로 활용하는 것을 차단해야 한다. 본 연구는 크라우드펀딩에서의 SAFE 도입 및 효과에 대해 국내에서 처음으로 진행된 연구라는 점에서 의미가 있다.","This study analyzes the valuation problems surrounding equity-based crowdfunding issuers and examines the introduction of the simple agreement for future equity (SAFE) as a means of solving them. We first analyze four stocks with crowdfunding experience listed on KONEX and K-OTC. In all instances, market capitalization consistently fell below the level at the time of the crowdfunding application. We therefore suggest the introduction of SAFE in crowdfunding as a potential solution. SAFE ameliorates the over-valuation problem by setting only minimum requirements such as valuation caps and by delaying the evaluation of corporate value until a follow-up investment is made. However, investor protection should be considered when introducing SAFE in Korea. First, the definition of “subsequent investments” should be clarified to prevent the issuer from intentionally delaying the transfer of shares. Second, the inclusion of financial performance in SAFEs share conversion conditions would prevent the firm from delaying share conversion while receiving favorable cash flows. Third, the scope of companies that can issue SAFE should be clearly defined to prevent firms from misusing them to avoid managerial interference. This study contributes as the first study within the Korean academia on the introduction and effectiveness of SAFE in crowdfunding."

Transnational Koreans in Asian Pop Culture in the Pre-Korean Wave Era,2020,"['Korean Wave', 'Asian popular culture', 'Kim Yom', 'Hong Kong film', 'Korean film']",,"The Korean Wave, which refers to the overseas popularity of South Korean culture, is moving toward a new stage of development. Seen in conjunction with the recent performances of K-pop bands on global music platforms, Korean film Parasites winning four prizes at the 92nd Academy Awards in 2020 has led commentators to argue that the whole world is now observing the Korean Wave phenomena. However, while the global rise of Korean pop culture has been documented continuously, most of the research has been centered around either Korean production or foreign consumption. Additionally, while the transnationality of popular culture has led academia to adopt the theory of hybridity, its application to the Korean Wave was largely limited to textual studies. Against this backdrop, this research will shed light on diasporic Korean artistes who have been largely forgotten either in Korea or in their resettled and adopted cultures. In particular, this study will zero in on Korean actors and filmmakers in Shanghai in the 1930s and the Korean-Hong Kongese film collaborations in the 1960s and inquire into their cultural meanings in inter-Asian popular culture. For one, Korean director Jeong Chang-hwa handed down his action film know-how to Hong Kong cinema, which would later become a global action film hub. This relationship continued when the Hong Kong International Film Festival recognized Parasites director Bong Joon-hos talent on the international level first by screening his short films in 1994. As such, this research will also open up new avenues of understanding the history of East Asian popular culture."

The experimental design of this study was analyzed using two-way ANOVAs with repeated measures of groups and time. Cognitive function was assessed by neuroelectrical response, and ERP analysis. The results of the study showed that the interactive video game group and aerobic exercise group showed no significant statistical differences in the response time, response accuracy, amplitude and potential of the performance of the exercise in cognitive function and ERP analysis, but improved the interaction video game group and aerobic exercise (walking) group over the control group. It was concluded that long-term aerobic exercise like interactive video game is associated with attenuation of cognitive decline in the elderly."

Y. 2018), as well as to explore a means of converging these two approaches in an EFL setting. Specifically, the study identifies the perceptions of 24 Korean university students to a classroom activity designed to raise the awareness of the participants to several tenets of both DP and EIcL. The results indicate that the activity promoted this awareness for the majority of participants and that the participants had a positive perception of the activity itself. With these findings in mind, a number of pedagogical implications are discussed."
Large amplitude free vibrations of FGM shallow curved tubes in thermal environment,2020,"['nonlinear free vibration', 'FGM', 'shallow curved tube', 'von Karman nonlinearity', 'two-step perturbation method', 'thermal environment']",,"In the current investigation, large amplitude free vibration behavior of shallow curved pipes (tubes) made of functionally graded materials is investigated. Properties of the tube are distributed across the radius of the tube and are obtained by means of a power law function. It is also assumed that all thermo-mechanical properties are temperature dependent. The governing equations of the tube are obtained using a higher order shear deformation tube theory, where the traction free boundary conditions are satisfied on the top and bottom surfaces of the tube. The von Kármán type of geometrical non-linearity is included into the formulation to consider the large displacements and small strains. Uniform temperature elevation of the tube is also included into the formulation. For the case of tubes which are simply supported in flexure and axially immovable, the governing equations are solved using the two-step perturbation technique. Closed form expressions are provided to obtain the small and large amplitude fundamental natural frequencies of the FGM shallow curved tubes in thermal environment. Numerical results are given to explore the effects of thermal environment, radius ratio, and length to thickness ratio of the tube on the fundamental linear and non-linear frequencies."

For this purpose, a qualitative analysis of personal interviews and a quantitative analysis of the relationship between the self-reported father personas and student-father communications were conducted. The qualitative research was conducted to nine first-grade students in elementary school K and recorded and analyzed the process. For the quantitative study, 298 first-year students (161 males and 137 females) in the same area were asked to respond to the child-father communication scale, and 298 students’ fathers responded to the multi-person persona test. The qualitative findings show that fathers are classified as players, talkers, businessmen, angry dads, naggers, and dads who are separated. Quantitative studies show that perfection and face-oriented personas tend to be most common among participating fathers. There were also differences in gender between persona and communication: The son was caring-oriented persona and the daughter perfection-oriented persona were associated with an interactive fathering attitude of the children’s father. This means that even the first grade students of the same elementary school can establish effective communication relationships if their father’s use of persona differs according to gender."
헤이안 문학에 나타난 「와가야도(わが宿)」표현의 방법,2020,"['Heian Literature', 'yado', 'wagayado', 'a wisteria', 'Waka', '헤이안 문학', '야도', '와가야도', '등나무꽃', '와카']",,文学作品における「空間」は物理的な意味合いを超えて、その空間に結びついた情緒の世界やイメージを読み取ることが何より重要である。本稿で取り扱う「わが宿」という歌語は、「家」の意味を含む「宿」の複合語でとりわけ『源氏物語』における表現方法に特徴が見られる言葉である。そもそも「やど」という語は「屋」の「外」すなわち建物の外側や庭という意味で使われたり「屋」の「戸」つまり「家の戸口」の意味を持つ「ヤド」と、「宿を借る」の意味で使われる「ヤド」があって、両者が混同しつつ平安時代になると「やど」は「庭」とは違うものを意味するようになる。特に、平安時代の物語作品の中で「宿」は人物の不在の状況においてその人物がいないことによってもたらされる寂しさの情緒を喚起する空間表現として用いられている。また「わが宿」の表現は『源氏物語』においては邸宅の所有者（婚期に遅れかけた娘を持つ父親)が婿がねの人物の来訪を促す形で用いられている。婿になる人物が邸宅の景物を詠作者と共に見ることが結婚を意味することになる。『源氏物語』では、藤原氏の家で源氏の婿を迎え入れるという物語上の要求に合わせて「わが宿」と「藤」の歌語を用いた方法的な和歌を配置することにより、印象的な藤花宴の場面を作り上げている。

Methods: We enrolled 415 untreated male OSAS patients (apnea-hypopnea index, AHI ≥5/h on polysomnography) who were under 50 years old (mean age 37.5±8.0 years). Participants completed Korean version of Beck depression inventory II (K-BDI-II), Pittsburgh sleep quality index-Korean (PSQI-K), insomnia severity index (ISI), and Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS). Participants were classified into nocturia and non-nocturia group according to the following question “Do you find yourself waking up to urinate more than twice each night?” All information was compared between two groups. Results: 22.7% (94/415) of patients reported to have nocturia. Patients with nocturia had higher score of K-BDI-II, PSQI-K, ISI, and ESS although their age and the proportion of consumption of alcohol or caffeine and metabolic diseases were not different from patients without nocturia. AHI was not significantly higher in nocturia group (38.0±29.2/h) than non-nocturia group (32.8±25.7/h, p=0.118), however, parameters indicating sleep quality were worse in nocturia group, i.e.lesser non-rapid eye movement sleep stage 3 (N3) sleep % and higher arousal index, total apnea index, and 90% oxygen desaturation index (ODI). 90% ODI and N3 sleep % were revealed to be independent factors associated with nocturia. Conclusions: Considerable numbers of male OSAS patients who are under 50 years suffer from nocturia and they have worse sleep quality compared to non-nocturia patients. Higher oxygen desaturation and lesser N3 sleep % are highly predictive factors for nocturia rather than AHI in these patients."

The media are showing the remarkable growth to meet humans’ instinct to pursue the quickness and convenience.In the recent world of daily life, the phenomenon of snack culture is noticeably shown. With the explosive public popularity of webtoons and web-dramas based on the mass media, various media platforms such as YouTube, Netflix, and Instagram have been formed, and also the culture & arts-related contents suitable for the characteristics of media and users’ needs have been newly formed. The core of snack culture is the occurrence of production and consumption at a rapid pace with no boundary of roles. Also, the participation and sharing are occurred promptly.Because there are no limitations on place, time, and language of this phenomenon, everyone who has a communication device in the whole world could enjoy the snack culture in the horizontal relationships, and the access and out could be done according to users’ active attitude.The street dance could elaborately expresses various musics and rhythms with each joint and muscle of body by pursuing the active revelation of oneself through free and individual movements. Also, as a dance culture originated from street, the dance could be shown anytime and anywhere such as park, club, square, school, auditorium, and theater, so that it could be viewed and participated by everyone as well. The street dance that has been developed targeting the unspecified public was hard to obtain the objective evaluation due to its characteristics like placeness and movement, and the scale or standard was also ambiguous. Thus, it was the most important to draw the active responses, needs, and cheers from the public, to exchange the energy together, and to enjoy together.

Nonlinear damage detection using linear ARMA models with classification algorithms,2020,"['nonlinear damage detection', 'time series analysis', 'linear autoregressive moving average model', 'vector space cosine similarity', 'classification algorithms']",,"Majority of the damage in engineering structures is nonlinear. Damage sensitive features (DSFs) extracted by traditional methods from linear time series models cannot effectively handle nonlinearity induced by structural damage. A new DSF is proposed based on vector space cosine similarity (VSCS), which combines K-means cluster analysis and Bayesian discrimination to detect nonlinear structural damage. A reference autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model is built based on measured acceleration data. This study first considers an existing DSF, residual standard deviation (RSD). The DSF is further advanced using the VSCS, and then the advanced VSCS is classified using K-means cluster analysis and Bayes discriminant analysis, respectively. The performance of the proposed approach is then verified using experimental data from a three-story shear building structure, and compared with the results of existing RSD. It is demonstrated that combining the linear ARMA model and the advanced VSCS, with cluster analysis and Bayes discriminant analysis, respectively, is an effective approach for detection of nonlinear damage. This approach improves the reliability and accuracy of the nonlinear damage detection using the linear model and significantly reduces the computational cost. The results indicate that the proposed approach is potential to be a promising damage detection technique."

Comparative evaluation of the effectiveness of ultrasonic tips versus the Terauchi file retrieval kit for the removal of separated endodontic instruments,2020,"['Root canal therapy', 'Separated instruments', 'Ultrasonics']",,Objective: The aim of this study was to perform a comparative evaluation of the effectiveness of ultrasonic tips versus the Terauchi file retrieval kit (TFRK) for the removal of broken endodontic instruments.Materials and Methods: A total of 80 extracted human first mandibular molars with moderate root canal curvature were selected. Following access cavity preparation canal patency was established with a size 10/15 K-file in the mesiobuccal canals of all teeth. The teeth were divided into 2 groups of 40 teeth each: the P group (ProUltra tips) and the T group (TFRK). Each group was further subdivided into 2 smaller groups of 20 teeth each according to whether ProTaper F1 rotary instruments were fractured in either the coronal third (C constituting the PC and TC groups) or the middle third (M constituting the PM and TM groups). Instrument retrieval was performed using either ProUltra tips or the TFRK.Results: The overall success rate at removing the separated instrument was 90% in group P and 95% in group T (p > 0.05) The mean time for instrument removal was higher with the ultrasonic tips than with the TFRK (p > 0.05).Conclusion: Both systems are acceptable clinical tools for instrument retrieval but the loop device in the TFRK requires slightly more dexterity than is needed for the ProUltra tips.

Meanwhile, The prosperity of the cultural contents industry due to the popularity of the Korean Wave has the economic ripple effect of increasing Korea's exports of consumer goods. This means that consumption of the same cultural products increases the cultural proximity between the regions, thereby promoting trade by increasing preference for consumer goods that involve tastes in the selection. Through this, it is expected that Korea's small and medium-sized enterprises will be able to increase their relatively low exports to Europe. As interest in K-pop and Korean broadcasting is growing in Europe, consumer goods such as cosmetics and food are likely to become promising export items to Europe. To take advantage of these opportunities effectively, efforts will be needed to link related products with the Korean Wave content in each field. In this paper, I suggest ways to increase marketing effects and even utilize 'FTA' special regulations for European market by organizing promising items due to the Korean Wave as a set."

A Prospective Observation of Psychological Distress in Patients With Anaphylaxis,2020,"['Anaphylaxis', 'stress disorders', 'post-traumatic', 'psychological distress', 'anxiety', 'depression']",,"Purpose: Anaphylaxis is an immediate allergic reaction characterized by potentially life-threatening, severe, systemic manifestations. While studies have evaluated links between serious illness and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), few have investigated PTSD after anaphylaxis in adults. We sought to investigate the psychosocial burden of recent anaphylaxis in Korean adults.Methods: A total of 203 (mean age of 44 years, 120 females) patients with anaphylaxis were recruited from 15 university hospitals in Korea. Questionnaires, including the Impact of Event Scale-Revised-Korean version (IES-R-K), the Korean version of the Beck Anxiety Inventory (K-BAI), and the Korean version of the Beck Depression Inventory (K-BDI), were administered. Demographic characteristics, causes and clinical features of anaphylaxis, and serum inflammatory markers, including tryptase, platelet-activating factor, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and C-reactive protein, were evaluated.Results: PTSD (IES-R-K ≥ 25) was noted in 84 (41.4%) patients with anaphylaxis. Of them, 56.0% had severe PTSD (IES-R-K ≥ 40). Additionally, 23.2% and 28.1% of the patients had anxiety (K-BAI ≥ 22) and depression (K-BDI ≥ 17), respectively. IES-R-K was significantly correlated with both K-BAI (r = 0.609, P < 0.0001) and K-BDI (r = 0.550, P < 0.0001). Among the inflammatory mediators, tryptase levels were lower in patients exhibiting PTSD; meanwhile, platelet-activating factor levels were lower in patients exhibiting anxiety and depression while recovering from anaphylaxis. In multivariate analysis, K-BAI and K-BDI were identified as major predictive variables of PTSD in patients with anaphylaxis.Conclusions: In patients with anaphylaxis, we found a remarkably high prevalence of PTSD and associated psychological distresses, including anxiety and depression. Physicians ought to be aware of the potential for psychological distress in anaphylactic patients and to consider psychological evaluation."

Methods: Secondary data analysis was utilized with data collected from electronic medical records of patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention in a university hospital from 2011 to 2015 and who were on an outpatient follow-up visit as of January 2020. The K-means cluster analysis was performed on seven cardiovascular risk factors. Major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), including hospitalization due to restenosis or cardiac-related death, was required in clinical prognosis. The Cox proportional-hazard regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used. Results: Cluster analysis identified three clusters of ‘obesity and family history’ (n=150), ‘smoking and drinking’ (n=178), and ‘chronic disease’ (n=190). The MACEs occurred in 10.4% of study subjects. When the ‘obesity and family history’ cluster (62.94±12.09 years) was used as a reference, the relative risk of MACEs was 2.57 times higher in the ‘smoking and drinking’ cluster (62.63±13.31 years) and 2.41 times higher in the ‘chronic disease’ cluster (70.90±10.30 years). Conclusion: Cluster-type risk factors are necessary when considering secondary prevention strategies for MACEs in patients with CAD. Patients with smoking, drinking, and chronic diseases are especially required to improve their lifestyles and to regularly monitor their management of underlying diseases during follow-up periods."

IOL power was determined using SRK/T, Barrett Universal II, and T2 preoperatively. The findings were compared with the actual refractive outcome to obtain the prediction error. The mean prediction error (ME) and mean absolute error (MAE) of each formula were compared. The MAE was defined as the difference between the postoperative spherical equivalence (SE) and the preoperatively predicted SE. The ME and MAE of each formula 3 months after surgery were compared with preoperatively predicted SE. Eyes were classified into subgroups based on axial length (AL) and average keratometry (K).Results: The ME and MAE for the three formulas were SRK/T [-0.08 ± 0.45 diopters (D) and 0.35 ± 0.40 D, respectively], Barrett Universal II (-0.01 ± 0.44 D and 0.33 ± 0.30 D, respectively), and T2 (0.04 ± 0.45 D and -0.34 ± 0.30 D, respectively), but no statistically significant differences were detected. Similar results were obtained in groups with a long AL or a large average K. In groups with an AL ≥ 26 mm or with an average K ≥ 47 D, the Barrett Universal II formula yielded the smallest standard deviation and a ME closest to zero, but these differences were not statistically significant.Conclusions: No significant differences were observed between the three formulas regarding ME or MAE. However, recent formulas such as the Barrett Universal II could provide certain benefits in predicting IOL power for patients with a long AL (> 26 mm) or larger average K. Further research with a larger sample size is recommended for more evaluation."

The objective of this paper is to develop a model to estimate art price, and to compare and analyze the predictive performance of nonparametric models.Methods: This study used nonparametric models (e.g., random forests, k-nearest neighbor, support vector regression) to predict the price of artworks and compared their prediction accuracy performances based on root mean square error (RMSE). An evaluation was carried out on five years of Korean auction data from 2014 to 2018. The performance of the model can be improved by selecting appropriate hyperparameters and be generalized through 10-fold cross-validation.Results: According to the results of comparing the predicted performance based on the RMSE calculated for each fold optimization model, the random forest model predicted the best performance. In particular, the prediction error of the random forest model was about 40% lower than that of the parametric OLS model.Conclusion: This study proves the applicability of nonparametric models to estimate art prices empirically. The developed model described in this paper reduces the transaction cost of artworks and reduces the limitations of the art appraisal system."
Machine Learning Models for Predicting Hearing Prognosis in Unilateral Idiopathic Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss,2020,"['Sudden Hearing Loss', 'Machine Learning', 'Prognosis', 'Prediction']",,"Objectives. Prognosticating idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) is an important challenge. In our study, a dataset was split into training and test sets and cross-validation was implemented on the training set, thereby determining the hyperparameters for machine learning models with high test accuracy and low bias. The effectiveness of the following five machine learning models for predicting the hearing prognosis in patients with ISSNHL after 1 month of treatment was assessed: adaptive boosting, K-nearest neighbor, multilayer perceptron, random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM).Methods. The medical records of 523 patients with ISSNHL admitted to Korea University Ansan Hospital between January 2010 and October 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. In this study, we analyzed data from 227 patients (recovery, 106; no recovery, 121) after excluding those with missing data. To determine risk factors, statistical hypothesis tests (e.g., the two-sample t-test for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables) were conducted to compare patients who did or did not recover. Variables were selected using an RF model depending on two criteria (mean decreases in the Gini index and accuracy).Results. The SVM model using selected predictors achieved both the highest accuracy (75.36%) and the highest F-score (0.74) on the test set. The RF model with selected variables demonstrated the second-highest accuracy (73.91%) and F-score (0.74). The RF model with the original variables showed the same accuracy (73.91%) as that of the RF model with selected variables, but a lower F-score (0.73). All the tested models, except RF, demonstrated better performance after variable selection based on RF.Conclusion. The SVM model with selected predictors was the best-performing of the tested prediction models. The RF model with selected predictors was the second-best model. Therefore, machine learning models can be used to predict hearing recovery in patients with ISSNHL."

In this study, the spatial and temporal downscaling of the GFS model, a cumulative solar radiation forecast model per 3 hours units, was conducted to measure forecast performance. First, in the case of spatial downscaling, K-means clustering of solar radiation values corresponding to all latitude and longitude values of the Korean Peninsula was performed, and seven clusters were formed. Second, in the case of temporal downscaling, the cumulative solar radiation forecast value over 3 h was converted to the cumulative solar radiation value over 1 h. To measure the downscaling performance, the downscaling results of the cumulative forecast over 1 h of the GFS model were compared with the observed solar radiation values of the UASIBS-KIER model. We performed downscaling by using the same average ratio as the cumulative value over 3 h. In addition, we performed downscaling by using the correlation between the cumulative value over 1 h by the UASIBS-KIER model. Based on the rRMSE and rMAE, the use of the correlation was found to be more efficient that the use of the same average ratio."

The commentary is presented in the form of questions and answers about redundancy, suitability or effectiveness of the sūtras. The notion of anabhihita is introduced in P.2.3.1 which, as an adhikārasūtra(heading rule), serves as a constraint on the introduction of vibhaktis. According to P.2.3.1, a vibhakti can occur after a nominal stem to express a kāraka(thematic role) when the same has not already been expressed by some other means. The need for this rule is demonstrated by comparing it with SA155 which appears to have the same effect as P.2.3.1, and by discussing the scope of P.2.3.46 dealing with the first vibhakti. This verification is based on the fact that the basic meaning of the first vibhakti is ​​number, but not kāraka. In addition, the case where the same vibhakti is ​​applied repeatedly to various components of a sentence is explained in terms of parigaṇana(enumeration).Anabhihitāhnika also examines 12 sūtras from P.2.3.2 to P.2.3.17. It talks about the cases where sūtras may not cover practical usage, and where two vibhaktis or rules may be applied to the identical argument, and where a vibhakti may express anything other than a kāraka. The proposed countermeasures for various types of possible problems show that the individual sūtras dealing with vibhaktis are organically related to each other in one framework and that accurate and practical language expressions can be obtained, when sūtras are applied in accordance with adhikārasūtra and related principles."

Automatic Classification Models and Algorithms Based on the Minimum Sum-of-Squared Errors Model,2020,"['Clustering', 'Automatic Classification', 'Mssc', 'Mahalanobis Distance', 'Evolutionary Algorithm']",,"We propose new models and algorithms for automatic classification of objects (clustering) based on the minimum sum-of-squared errors clustering (MSSC) model. Our approach was aimed at improving the accuracy and stability of the result in solving practical problems, such as identifying homogeneous batches of industrial products. We examined the application of the MSSC model and k-means algorithm with various distance measures: Euclidean, Manhattan, Mahalanobis for the problem of automatic classification of objects in a multi-dimensional space of measured parameters (features). For such problems, we present a new model (Mahalanobis Minimum Sum-of-Squared Error Clustering, MMSSC) for solving problems of automatic classification based on the MSSC model with Mahalanobis distance. In addition, we present a new algorithm for automatic classification of objects based on the MMSSC optimization model with the Mahalanobis distance measure and the weighted average covariance matrix calculated from the training sample (pre-labeled data). This algorithm allows us to reduce the number of errors (increasing the Rand index) when identifying homogeneous production batches based on the results of quality control tests. A new approach in the development of evolutionary algorithms for the MSSC problem is presented using a greedy agglomerative heuristic procedure contained in several genetic operators. The use of this approach enables a statistically significant increase in the accuracy of the result (the achieved value of the objective function within the chosen MMSSC mathematical model), as well as its stability, in a fixed time, in comparison with the known algorithms. Thus, in this work, an increase in the accuracy of solving the problem of automatic classification is achieved both by increasing the adequacy of the model (according to the Rand index) and by improving the algorithm that allows us to achieve the best objective function values of within the framework of the chosen model."

The wind data which consists of hourly wind speed between 2010 and 2013 years, was measured at the 10-meters height in four different ground stations (Datça, Fethiye, Marmaris, Köyceğiz). These stations are operated by The Turkish State Meteorological Service (T.S.M.S). Furthermore, wind data was analyzed by using Log-Normal and Gamma distributions, since these distributions fit better than Weibull, Normal, Exponential and Logistic distributions. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the coefficients of the goodness of fit (R2) were also determined by using statistical analysis. According to the results, extreme wind speed in the research area was 33 m/s at the Datça station. The effective wind load at this speed is 0.68 kN/m2. The highest mean power densities for Datça, Fethiye, Marmaris and Köyceğiz were found to be 46.2, 1.6, 6.5 and 2.2 W/m2, respectively. Also, although Log-normal distribution exhibited a good performance i.e., lower AD (Anderson – Darling statistic (AD) values) values, Gamma distribution was found more suitable in the estimation of wind speed and power of the region."

Herein, we aimed to develop the Korean version of the DiN test to provide a useful hearing screening tool for clinical as well as research purposes.Method: Spoken monosyllabic digits from 0 to 9 were recorded by a female speaker. The test list was constructed such that each digit was placed in three different positions. An optimization procedure was conducted to equate the audibility of each digit. After the optimization, the smartphone application for the Korean DiN (K-DiN) test was developed.For the adaptive measurement procedure, 180 new DiN triplets separated into six lists of 30 were created. Mean speech recognition threshold values for each list and session were measured to examine the test-retest and training effects of the test materials. In addition, speech recognition threshold values measured by different devices were compared to determine whether the speech recognition threshold levels differed.Results: Optimization results showed that the mean speech recognition threshold and slope were −11.55 dB signal-to-noise ratio and 10.21%/dB, respectively, which are comparable to levels shown in different-language versions of the DiN test. The results of the test-retest and training effects revealed no significant differences among the test sessions and lists.Additionally, the mean speech recognition threshold values measured by four different devices were not different, indicating the reliability of the test materials.Conclusion: We believe this study is the first to attempt to develop a K-DiN test. Our results indicate that this test can be used as a potentially reliable hearing screening tool."

We performed the following assessments: Korean ADHD rating scale-IV (K-ARS-IV), children depression inventory, state/trait anxiety inventory for children, and MMN (measured at Fz, FCz, Cz, and CPz).Results: There were no sex or mean age differences between the groups (2 = −0.01, p = 0.958; Z = −1.88, p = 0.060, respectively). The ADHD group had a significantly higher mean K-ARS-IV score (26.13 ± 9.56 vs. 17.15 ± 11.73, Z = −2.11, p = 0.035). Significant differences were found according to symptom severity in the MMN amplitude at FCz (Z = −2.11, p = 0.035) and MMN latency at Fz and FCz (Z = −2.48, p = 0.013; Z = −2.57, p = 0.010).The K-ARS-IV, K-ARS inattention subscale, and K-ARS hyperactivity-impulsivity subscale scores in the ADHD group correlated significantly with the MMN amplitude at Cz and CPz.Conclusion: This study found differences in the MMN amplitude and latency according to the severity of ADHD symptoms and identified MMN as a potential adjunct to the diagnosis of ADHD."
Numerical simulation and investigation of jet impingement cooling heat transfer for the rotor blade,2020,"['rotor blade', 'turbine cooling', 'jet impingement', 'heat transfer', 'CFD simulation', 'numerical']",,"Investigation of leading edge impingement cooling for first stage rotor blades in an aero-engine turbine, its effect on rotor temperature and trailing edge wake loss have been undertaken in this study. The rotor is modeled with the nozzle for attaining a more accurate simulation. The rotor blade is hollowed in order for the coolant to move inside. Also, plenum with the 15 jet nozzles are placed in it. The plenum is fed by compressed fresh air at the rotor hub. Engine operational and real condition is exerted as boundary condition. Rotor is inspected in two states: in existence of cooling technique and non-cooling state. Three-dimensional compressible and steady solutions of RANS equations with SST K-ω turbulent model has been performed for this numerical simulation. The results show that leading edge is one of the most critical regions because of stagnation formation in those areas. Another high temperature region is rotor blade tip for existence of tip leakage in this area and jet impingement cooling can effectively cover these regions. The rotation impact of the jet velocity from hub to tip caused a tendency in coolant streamlines to move toward the rotor blade tip. In addition, by discharging used coolant air from the trailing edge and ejecting it to the turbines main flow by means of the slot in trailing edge, which could reduce the trailing edge wake loss and a total decrease in the blade cooling loss penalty."

In this study, numerical analysis was performed to examine the effects of the hole size on the flow inside the smoke curtain. As the air supply size decreased, the flow rate through the air supply was formed relatively uniformly from the inlet to the outlet length of the emergency support system. In addition, the size of the air supply hole was more than 20 mm, the flow rate was very low near the outlet, so the air supply hole size should be smaller than 20 mm. In addition, the minor loss of the air supply hole was calculated to be K = 1.5 from the numerical results. Therefore, the proper design of an emergency evacuation support system is possible using the flow characteristics according to the size and minor loss of the air supply hole."

To analyze traits related to grain-shape, a total of 272 varieties derived from japonica, japonica black and Tongil-type rice accession in Korea were evaluated in this study. The traits, grain length (GL), grain width (GW), grain thickness (GT), length to width ratio (RLW), and 1000-grain weight (TGW) were measured and replicated 10 times. Genes (GW2, GS3, qGL3, qSW5, GS5, TGW6, GW7, and GW8) related to grain-shape were validated in the accessions using specific DNA marker sets. K-mean clustering of the accession based on phenotypic data revealed three groups: group 1 was classified by GW and GT and included most of japonica type, group 2 was classified by RLW and GL reached a medium size and possessed a half spindle-shaped type, and group 3 was classified by TGW, reached a long size and possessed a semi-round shape. In validation tests using the marker sets, both gw2 and tgw6 were validated in less than 1% of the tested accessions and two allelic types, qgl3 and gw8, were only verified in Tongil-type accessions. For GW8 and GW2, any different amplicons were not amplified in any japonica or Tongil-type accessions, respectively. In order to suggest the representative grain-shape gene combinations for each ecotype, the allelic combinations were evaluated by PCR analysis. Cj1 and 2 in japonica (Cj1-7), Cj_b1 and 2 in japonica-black (Cj_b1-3), and CT3 in Tongil-type (CT1-13) turned out to be the dominant combination in each ecotype, respectively. In addition, the results revealed that introgression of four genes (gw2, gs3, qSW5, and GS5) would expand the diversity of grain shape in Korean japonica varieties.

Cluster analysis is a widely used method for dividing observational objects into several clusters in multivariate data. However, cluster analysis through dimensional reduction may be more effective when several variables are related. In this paper, the food consumption data surveyed of 1,987 households was clustered using the K-means method, and 17 variables were re-selected to divide it into the clusters. Principal component analysis and factor analysis were compared as the solution for multicollinearity problems and as the way to reduce dimensions for clustering. In this study, both principal component analysis and factor analysis reduced the dataset into two dimensions. Although the principal component analysis divided the dataset into three clusters, it did not seem that the difference among the characteristics of the cluster appeared well. However, the characteristics of the clusters in the consumption pattern were well distinguished under the factor analysis method."
A Spectral-spatial Cooperative Noise-evaluation Method for Hyperspectral Imaging,2020,"['Mixed noise', 'Noise estimation', 'Hyperspectral image']",,"Hyperspectral images feature a relatively narrow band and are easily disturbed by noise. Accurate estimation of the types and parameters of noise in hyperspectral images can provide prior knowledge for subsequent image processing. Existing hyperspectral-noise estimation methods often pay more attention to the use of spectral information while ignoring the spatial information of hyperspectral images. To evaluate the noise in hyperspectral images more accurately, we have proposed a spectral-spatial cooperative noiseevaluation method. First, the feature of spatial information was extracted by Gabor-filter and K-means algorithms. Then, texture edges were extracted by the Otsu threshold algorithm, and homogeneous image blocks were automatically separated. After that, signal and noise values for each pixel in homogeneous blocks were split with a multiple-linear-regression model. By experiments with both simulated and real hyperspectral images, the proposed method was demonstrated to be effective and accurate, and the composition of the hyperspectral image was verified."

Human Identification by Measuring Respiration Patterns Using Vital FMCW Radar,2020,"['Human Identification', 'Non-contact Radar', 'DNN', 'Vital FMCW Radar']",,"This letter proposes a method of human identification that measures respiration patterns using frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar. We exploit the fact that respiration signal patterns are unique to each individual, and FMCW radar is employed to obtain the respiration information. Based on the strengths of FMCW radar, the proposed algorithm compensates for the inability to distinguish the respiration signals of multiple users, which are difficult for continuous wave radar to measure. The proposed algorithm also employs a deep neural network algorithm instead of the K-nearest neighbor algorithm that was used in a previous study. The proposed algorithm further improves the performance by using a least mean square filter in the input signal of the DNN. The experimental results show that the proposed human identification method successfully classified four persons."
"Geochemistry, zircon U-Pb ages and Sr-Nd-Hf isotopes of an Early Triassic appinitic complex in southeastern Inner Mongolia, China: implications for the late tectonic evolution of the Paleo-Asian Ocean",2020,"['Early Triassic', 'appinitic complex', 'petrogenesis', 'southeastern Inner Mongolia', 'Central Asian Orogenic Belt']",,"Appinite commonly occurs in convergent plate tectonic settings and thus can constrain the tectonic evolution of ancient orogens. Geochemical and geochronological analyses were carried out on a newly identified Early Triassic appinitic complex in southeastern Inner Mongolia in the eastern segment of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. Petrographically, the Luotuochang complex can be divided into two zones: an outer zone of intermediate rocks and inner zone dominated by mafic rocks. A monzonite sample from the outer zone yielded weighted mean zircon 206Pb/238U ages of 246 ± 1.6 Ma, whereas the gabbro from the inner zone yielded an age of 243 ± 1.2 Ma. The inner zone mafic rocks have SiO2 contents of 45.56 to 54.27 wt% with high MgO, Cr, Ni and Sr contents, elevated Ba/Nb, Ba/Zr, Rb/Y and Th/Zr, and low TiO2, Nb/Zr and Nb/Y. These features suggest that the metasomatized lithospheric mantle is the primitive magma source. SiO2 contents of the outer zone intermediate rocks range from 57.6 to 63.69 wt% and K2O, Ba and Sr contents are enriched; the εNd(t) (+2.2 to +4.0) and εHf(t) (+8.4 to +13.5) values are also high. These characteristics suggest that the magma of these rocks mainly derived from the mantle with possible juvenile lower crust involvement. Based on these geochemical data and results from regional geological investigations, we propose that the Luotuochang appinitic complex was formed in a post-orogenic extensional setting. Its formation was likely the result of lithospheric delamination, upwelling of new mantle material and partial melting of the overlying lower crust during crustal compression and thickening soon after the closure of the restricted Paleo-Asian Ocean basin."
일제강점기 독립운동가의 자기 기술: 『아리랑』 속 張志樂의 ‘廣州기억’을 중심으로,2020,"['장지락', '『아리랑』', '광주봉기', '광저우', '자기 기술', '기억', 'Jang Ji-rak', '“Song of Ariran : The Life Story of a Korean Rebel”', 'Guangzhou Uprising', 'Guangzhou', 'self-description', 'memory']","이 논문은 1937년 여름, 중국 옌안에서 있었던 독립운동가 장지락의 구술을 토대로 발간된 『아리랑』을 활용하여 그의 자기 기술과 그 전략을 살펴보았다. 『아리랑』에는 1925년부터 1927년까지 중국 광저우에서 머물면서 광주봉기와 하이루펑 소비에트 활동에 가담한 장지락의 경험담이 언급되었다. 다른 기록과 비교해볼 때, 이 책에서는 1920년대 중반 광저우에 있던 한인의 동향과 광주봉기 등에 대한 장지락만의 독특한 ‘광저우 기억’을 확인할 수 있다.  1920년대 중반 광저우 한인 사회에 대해 『아리랑』에서는 1927년까지 한인 800명이 중국혁명 참가를 목적으로 광저우에 집결했고 이들은 주로 공산주의와 관련 있으며, 한인 공산주의자를 주축으로 한 K.K.라는 단체도 결성되었다고 했다. 하지만 다른 기록에서는 광저우의 한인수를 그의 절반 수준인 300∼400명 정도로 추산했고, 한인의 광저우 집결 동기를 황푸군관학교 입학에서 찾는 등 차이를 보였다. 광주봉기에 대해서는 주로 장지락의 경험을 위주로 한 반면, 광주봉기군 철수 당시 최용건이 이끄는 황푸군관학교 특무영 내 한인들의 사하 전투 참전과 150명의 희생, 광주 봉기 당시 김성숙의 역할 등은 언급이 없었다.  이처럼 『아리랑』에서 독특한 ‘광저우 기억’이 확인되는 이유는 이 책이 장지락의 구술을 토대로 구성되었는데, 구술 과정에서 그의 광저우 경험에 대한 선택과 재해석이 이루어졌고 이때 일종의 ‘자기 기술 전략’이 작용했다고 보이기 때문이다. 그런데 장지락이 광저우에서의 과오와 한계까지도 함께 밝혔고 구술 당시 만주행을 결심했다는 점에서 그의 ‘광저우 기억’은 새로운 활동을 앞두고 그간의 경험을 일종의 ‘교훈’으로 삼으려는데 목적이 있다고 보인다.  한편 『아리랑』을 매개로 한 장지락의 ‘광저우 기억’은 해방 후 한국사회에서 1920년대 광저우 한인 독립운동에 대한 기억의 ‘주류’로 자리매김하게 되었다. 하지만 장지락이 이미 1938년 중국에서 ‘숙청’된 상황에서 이러한 양상은 과거의 기억을 주도하겠다는 장지락 개인의 전략으로는 볼 수 없다. 그보다는 해방 후 한국 사회에 만연한 반공 분위기 속에서 광저우를 경험한 또 다른 당사자의 ‘침묵’이 만들어낸 ‘의도되지 않은’ 결과였던 것이다.","This study set out to examine the characteristics and strategies of Jang Ji-rak’s self-description based on Arirang published on the basis of his oral statements as an independent activist in Yan’an, China in the summer of 1937. This Arirang mentions Jang’s experiences as he joined the Guangzhou Uprising and Hailufeng Soviet activities during his stay in Guangzhou, China in 1925∼1927. Compared with other records, it offers descriptions about the situation of the Korean community in Guangzhou in the middle 1920s and Jang’s unique “Guangzhou memories” of Guangzhou Uprising.  Arirang offers some information about the Korean community of Guangzhou in the middle 1920s, recording that 800 Koreans gathered in Guangzhou to participate in the Chinese Revolution until 1927, that these Koreans had something to do mainly with communism, and that a group called K.K. was formed around Korean communists. Other records, however, estimate that 300∼400 Koreans, which were half the estimation of Arirang, gathered in Guangzhou to enroll in Huangpu Military Academy, thus having differences from Arirang. While Arirang mainly mentions Jang""s experiences with Guangzhou Uprising, its descriptions do not cover the Koreans at the Saha battle and the sacrifice of 150 Koreans under Teukmuyeong at Huangpu Military Academy led by Choi Yong-geon during the withdrawal of the uprising combatants, as well as the roles of Kim Seong-suk during Guangzhou Uprising.  Unlike other records, Arirang offers Jang’s unique “Guangzhou memories” because of his “self-description strategy” of some sort reproduced in the oral statement process. Jang, however, made it sure that Arirang contains even his mistakes and limitations in Guangzhou, which suggests that he wrote Arirang as a “lesson” from his experiences after he decided to move to Manchuria during the oral statement rather than a means of simply “showing off” his achievements or “restoring his place at the party register.” Despite its essential nature as a “collection of Jang’s unique memories,” Arirang established itself as part of the “mainstream” memories of Korean people’s Independence Movement in Guangzhou in the 1920s in the Korean society after its liberation. It was not an outcome of Jang’s strategy, but an “unexpected result” of “silence” among other participants that experienced Guangzhou in the prevalent anti-communist atmosphere of Korean society after its liberation."

The first step is, in original data, making of additional information necessary to the system design by using the linear interpolation method. Next is generating the valid input data in which the rapidly increasing trend is mitigated by the 2nd order trend difference method. Final step is designing the IT2TSK fuzzy prediction system that can properly handle the uncertainty involved in the generated data. To design IT2TSK fuzzy prediction system, IT2 fuzzy sets, K-means clustering algorithm, and least square method are used individually for expressing the footprint of uncertainty, tuning the IT2 fuzzy sets, and identifying the parameters of TSK regressive model. In simulation, the performance and effectiveness of the proposed system are verified by comparing with other system after analyzing the prediction results of two types of electric power load data."
Impurity profiling and chemometric analysis of methamphetamine seizures in Korea,2020,"['methamphetamine', 'impurity profiling', 'chemometric analysis', 'GC-FID/MS']",,"Methamphetamine (MA) is currently the most abused illicit drug in Korea. MA is produced by chemical synthesis, and the final target drug that is produced contains small amounts of the precursor chemicals, intermediates, and by-products. To identify and quantify these trace compounds in MA seizures, a practical and feasible approach for conducting chromatographic fingerprinting with a suite of traditional chemometric methods and recently introduced machine learning approaches was examined. This was achieved using gas chromatography (GC) coupled with a flame ionization detector (FID) and mass spectrometry (MS). Following appropriate examination of all the peaks in 71 samples, 166 impurities were selected as the characteristic components. Unsupervised (principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and K-means clustering) and supervised (partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), support vector machines (SVM), and deep neural network (DNN) with Keras) chemometric techniques were employed for classifying the 71 MA seizures. The results of the PCA, HCA, K-means clustering, PLS-DA, OPLS-DA, SVM, and DNN methods for quality evaluation were in good agreement. However, the tested MA seizures possessed distinct features, such as chirality, cutting agents, and boiling points. The study indicated that the established qualitative and semi-quantitative methods will be practical and useful analytical tools for characterizing trace compounds in illicit MA seizures. Moreover, they will provide a statistical basis for identifying the synthesis route, sources of supply, trafficking routes, and connections between seizures, which will support drug law enforcement agencies in their effort to eliminate organized MA crime."

The accurate identification of Euphorbiaceae species is critical in sustainable utilization of plant resources. We examined 234 sequences of nrDNA ITS, cpDNA rbcL and matK loci from 20 species in Euphorbiaceae in Korea and three outgroup taxa to develop efficient DNA barcodes. The three barcode loci were successfully amplified and sequenced for all Euphorbiaceae species. nrDNA ITS locus showed the highest mean interspecific K2P distance (0.3034), followed by cpDNA matK (0.0830), and rbcL (0.0352) locus. The degree of species resolution for individual barcode loci ranged from 75% (rbcL and matK) to 80% (ITS). The degree of species resolution was not enhanced with the different combinations of three barcode loci. The combined data set of the three loci(ITS+rbcL+matK) provided 80% of species resolution. These results confirm that ITS locus, as a single barcode, is the best option for barcoding of the Euphorbiaceae in Korea."

We have five categories for purchasing places (hypermarket, supermarket, grocery store, convenience store and other stores). We empirically analyzed survey data on the Consumer’s Attitudes for Processed Food by using a Multinomial Logit model. Using the survey questions, time-sensitivity variable is constructed by using K-means clustering analysis to test our hypothesis. Time-sensitivity affects the decision-making of purchasing places and the results indicate that time-sensitive consumers are more likely to purchase processed food from hypermarket. Our empirical results show that information-obtaining sources (e.g., TV/radio, newspaper/magazine, and internet) and types of interested information on food (e.g., recipe and nutrition) are important factors for consumers who make purchases from hypermarket and supermarket in comparison to grocery store, the base category. However, those who purchase from convenience store and other stores are only significantly affected by socioeconomic characteristics."

Accurate assessment of the status of students’ knowledge, and individualized instruction development based on this, demands extensive effort from instructors. The objective of this study is to accurately analyze the knowledge status of students with minimal inputs by utilizing unsupervised learning techniques. A set of ten questions, reflecting six components has been devised in this study and students’ item responses have been collected by conducting computer-based tests with ninety-five students. Students have been clustered into four and five groups by k-means clustering and gaussian mixture model, respectively. Response patterns of individual groups have been analyzed and visualized in terms of the items and components. Such clustering analysis offers the opportunity to easily identify the strengths and weaknesses of each group. Specifically, clustering analysis reveals different response patterns of students with the same total scores. Additionally, it was observed that low-achieving students indicated diverse patterns in their responses as compared to the higher-achieving students. This information regarding the knowledge status of students is obtained through an automated procedure and is expected to aid instructors in developing customized instructions."

Generally, the vowels in monosyllabic content words are phonetically more prominent than the ones in monosyllabic function words as the former have phrasal stress, making the vowels in content words longer in length, higher in pitch, and louder in amplitude. This study, based on the speech samples from Korean-Spoken English Corpus (K-SEC) and Rated Korean-Spoken English Corpus (Rated K-SEC), examined 879 English noun phrases, which are composed of an article and a monosyllabic noun, from sentences which are rated on 4 levels of proficiency. The lengths of the vowels in these 879 target NPs were measured and the ratio of the vowel lengths in nouns to those in articles was calculated. It turned out that the higher the proficiency level, the greater the mean ratio of the vowels in nouns to the vowels in articles, confirming the research’s hypothesis. This research thus concluded that for the Korean English learners, the higher the English proficiency level, the better they could produce the stressed and unstressed vowels with more conspicuous length differences between them."

However, the expression of autophagy-related proteins has not been studied in chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma (COM) or with cholesteatoma (CholeOM). This study aimed to determine whether there is a difference between COM and CholeOM in autophagy-related gene mRNA expression. Subjects and Methods: For 47 patients with chronic otitis media, the inflammatory tissues were classified into granulation tissue (COM) or cholesteatoma (CholeOM) according to biopsy results. Results: PI3K mRNA expression (COM vs. CholeOM, mean±SD, 0.009±0.010 vs. 0.003±0.004; p=0.004) was lower, whereas Beclin-1 mRNA expression (0.089 ± 0.107 vs. 0.176 ± 0.163; p=0.034) was higher in the CholeOM group. Expression of PI3K mRNA in the CholeOM group was lower than that in the COM subgroups with presence of bacteria (0.022±0.019 vs. 0.001±0.001; p=0.001), otorrhea (0.049±0.068 vs. 0.003±0.004; p=0.004), and hearing loss over 40 dB (0.083±0.130 vs. 0.003±0.004; p=0.005).

‘소프트파워 인문학’의 정착을 위한 제언,2020,"['humanistic resources of Korea', 'soft power humanities', 'hyper-connected era', 'national competitiveness', 'country brand']",,"'Soft Power' is a contrasting concept with 'Hard Power' which refers to physical power such as military and economic power. This was presented by Joseph S. Nye, who described it as ""the power to get what you want by attracting peoples’ mind rather than coercion or reward."" As the international status of the US began to falter after 1980s, Nye disputed the decline of the US by claiming that it has strong Soft Power.Nye proposed the concept of ""Soft Power"" as a means to maintain the supremacy of the US in post-Cold War era. 'Soft Power' uses tangible and intangible resources that can be universally sympathized without using oppression or appeasement. And in terms of seeking voluntary consent, cooperation and support through the path of 'inspiration', the concept contains many elements to improve human society. Due to highly developed globalization and hyper-connectedness of communications and media, various information can be exchanged almost unlimitedly at low cost and high speed. Countries with weak Hard Power is now able to raise their national image and power through the expansion of Soft Power. Enhancing “Soft Power” is becoming the focus of attention all over the world, and Korea is no exception.Soft power is a holistic concept composed of various elements. The Korean Wave, which focuses on popular culture such as K-drama, K-film, and K-pop, has greatly contributed to the development of Korea’s Soft Power. However, popular cultural products are less relevant to the nation's awareness, and it is a difficult way for a serious understanding of the humanistic values ​​of Korean society. Also, there is a risk that a scandal or excessive commerciality of individual pop stars could cause a negative effect on the national image. Therefore, Korea's cultural products, which are drawing attention from the international community, and the 'Humanistic Soft Power' resources of the Korean society must be distributed and spread together, in order to promote a long-term and stable Soft Power and raise the overall level and vitality of the 'Korean Wave'.In order to achieve a long-term and reach higher level of national image improvement, Korea needs to develop “Soft Power Humanities” by utilizing the humanistic resources of Korean as a source of Soft Power. In author’s opinion, 'Soft Power Humanities' is a practical humanistic study that re-examines Korean humanistic resources from the perspective of 'Soft Power', and conducts collaborative research that transcends the boundaries and activity fields of academic disciplines, as well as the boundaries of regions and countries. As a wide range of region and diverse culture are set as targets of Soft Power, the cultural disposition and characteristics of each, and the preferred contents and formats are also included in the interests of ​​research.Soft Power Humanities not only could be a process of deepening academic research, but also pursues ideas to solve problems faced by Korea and the world. The publicity of scholarship will also be enhanced by establishment and implementation of a system that reflects humanistic values ​​in the research. If we spread and practice humanistic values in Korean society in advance, and deliver it to the international community further on, it will not only enhance the national brand but also improve human life.If the Humanistic research in Korea discuss the concept of 'Soft Power Humanities' and promote related academic fields, it will not only encourage the expansion of the reflective study, but also be able to better respond to the social expectations. Based on the idea that further interest and research in this field need to be promoted for strengthening Korea's Humanistic Soft Power, I suggest rudimentary opinions to academia."

The vast number of features makes intuitive understanding of a target domain difficult. Dimensionality reduction or manifold learning has potential to circumvent this obstacle, but restricted methods have been preferred. Objective The objective of this study is to observe the characteristics of various dimensionality reduction methods—locally linear embedding (LLE), multi-dimensional scaling (MDS), principal component analysis (PCA), spectral embedding (SE), and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)—on the RNA-Seq dataset from the genotype-tissue expression (GTEx) project. Results The characteristics of the dimensionality reduction methods are observed on the nine groups of three different tissues in the reduced space with dimensionality of two, three, and four. The visualization results report that each dimensionality reduction method produces a very distinct reduced space. The quantitative results are obtained as the performance of k-means clustering. Clustering in the reduced space from non-linear methods such as LLE, t-SNE and SE achieved better results than in the reduced space produced by linear methods like PCA and MDS. Conclusions The experimental results recommend the application of both linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction methods on the target data for grasping the underlying characteristics of the datasets intuitively."

They also verified the differences between firms that actually reduced taxes and those that did not. First, firms faced with financial constraints are difficult to finance externally, thus reducing taxes paid as one of the methods of internal financing. The tax plan used to reduce taxes was difficult to predict the scope of the investment and firms expected to increase the volatility of the taxes paid in the future. Second, if companies facing financial constraints actually invest in cash-saving tax plans, future tax payment volatility is expected to increase as tax authorities are more likely to detect tax investigations. Financial constraints used KZ-index presented by Kaplan and Zingales (1997) and K-score suggested by Altman (1968). The variability in future tax payments used the standard deviation of the cash effective tax rate (CASH ETR).As a result of empirical analysis, financial constraint and future tax payment volatility showed a significant positive relationship. This means that companies faced with financial constraints will invest in a wide range of tax plans, resulting in greater volatility in future taxes. In addition, this study compares the relationship between financial constraints and future tax payment volatility by dividing into tax-saving and non-tax-saving companies. As a result, only the companies that reduced taxes had a significant positive relationship between financial constraints and future tax payment volatility. This is interpreted as a significant positive relationship between financial constraints and future tax payment volatility due to the effect of companies that have actually paid taxes.This study has different points and contributions in the following points. First, the prior study was expanded by looking at the relationship between financial constraints and future tax payment variability by dividing the actual tax paid in cash into entities and entities that did not, compared to the Akamah et al.(2018) that verified the relationship between financial constraints and future tax payment variability. Second, the empirical results of this study that there is a positive relationship between financial constraints and future tax payment variability are expected to provide useful information to the entity's stakeholders in making investment decisions."
Evaluation of the antigen relatedness and efficacy of a single vaccination with different infectious bronchitis virus strains against a challenge with Malaysian variant and QX-like IBV strains,2020,"['Efficacy', 'infectious bronchitis virus', 'QX-like', 'variant']",,"Background: The predominant infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains detected in chickens in Malaysia are the Malaysian variant (MV) and QX-like, which are associated with respiratory distress, nephropathy, and high mortality. On the other hand, the antigenic relatedness and efficacy of IBV vaccines against these 2 field IBV strains are not well characterized. Objectives: This study aimed to determine the antigen relatedness and efficacy of different IB vaccine strains against a challenge with MV and QX-like strains. Methods: The antigen relatedness and the ability of different IB vaccine strains in conferring protection against MV and QX-like were assessed based on the clinical signs, macroscopic lesions, and ciliary activity. Results: The MV strain IBS037A/2014 showed minor antigenic subtype differences with the vaccine virus Mass H120 and 4/91 strains but showed major antigenic subtype differences with the K2 strain. The Malaysian QX-like strain IBS130/2015 showed major antigenic subtype differences with the MV strain IBS037A/2014 and the vaccine strains except for K2. Chickens vaccinated once with Mass (H120) or with non-Mass (4/91 and K2) developed antibody responses with the highest antibody titer detected in the groups vaccinated with H120 and 4/91. The mean ciliary activities of the vaccinated chickens were between 56 to 59% and 48 to 52% in chickens challenged with IBS037A/2014 and IBS130/2015, respectively. The vaccinated and challenged birds showed mild to severe lesions in the lungs and kidneys. Conclusions: Despite the minor antigenic subtype differences, a single inoculation with Mass or non-Mass vaccines could not protect against the MV IBS037A/2014 and QX-like IBS130/2015."

The purpose of this study is to examine how the conspicuous leisure consumption of bicycle enthusiasts during their leisure spending affects their happiness. In addition, this study aims to examine the moderating effects of self-esteem, leisure satisfaction, and recreation specialization. A questionnaire was conducted for the hobbyists who participated in the bicycle riding event run by the Seoul Sports Association, and 393 copies were used for the final analysis. SPSS 24.0 and AMOS 24.0 programs were used to process the data. Employed statistics were frequency analysis, descriptive statistics, confirmatory factor analysis, reliability analysis, correlation analysis, hierarchical regression analysis, k-means cluster analysis, and t-test using SPSS 24.0 version. First, self-esteem did not have a moderating effect on the relationship between conspicuous leisure consumption and happiness. Second, leisure satisfaction had a significant moderating effect(t=3.167, p<.01) on the relationship between conspicuous leisure consumption and happiness. In the high conspicuous leisure consumption group, leisure satisfaction was found to have a stronger impact on happiness. Third, recreation specialization did not have a moderating effect on the relationship between conspicuous leisure consumption and happiness. Thus, leisure satisfaction plays a role in mitigating the negative effects of conspicuous leisure consumption on happiness."
OBSERVING SITES FOR THE CENTRAL SOLAR ECLIPSES IN ANCIENT CHINESE HISTORY,2020,"['eclipses', 'ephemerides', 'history and philosophy of astronomy']",,"We determine the observing sites for eclipses of large magnitude recorded in ancient Chinese chronicles from 200 BCE to 900 CE, by adopting the difference between terrestrial time and universal time, ΔT, given by Morrison & Stephenson (2004). The records of solar eclipses with large magnitude are divided into four groups in accordance with the historical variations of the capital cities of ancient Chinese dynasties. We determine areas in which all the eclipses in each group, with an eclipse magnitude larger than a certain threshold value, could be observed. We find that these areas coincide with the historical capitals, which agrees with the general idea that the solar eclipses were observed at the capital of each dynasty. This result also verifies the ΔT values during the period from 100 BCE to 400 CE, during which historical records of eclipses are so rare that the ΔT values can only be obtained by interpolating the long-term data. Moreover, we show that the eclipses described by the term Ji in East-Asian history are not all total eclipses; their mean magnitude is 0.96 ± 0.04. We find that complementary expressions, such as dark daytime and appearance of stars during the eclipse, strengthen the possibility that eclipses described by the term Ji were total. We also provide quantitative definitions for expressions such as 'being not complete and like a hook', 'being almost complete', 'visibility of stars during the eclipse', and 'darkness during an eclipse.' The literal meanings of these expressions are in agreement with the recent physical modeling of sky brightness during total eclipses provided by Können & Hinz (2008)."

To this end, thirteen individual Korean feeder shipping companies are categorized into three possible alliances using K-mean clustering in terms of similarity of cargo carried by the carriers. Efficiency for the three alliances was measured through a multi-stage DEA which consists of fleet efficiency, loading efficiency, value efficiency and overall efficiency. It is found that there is a significant difference in efficiency scores among individual shipping companies, and that virtual formation of alliances would have a positive impact on the efficiency of individual shipping companies. It is also shown that difference in fleet and loading efficiencies between alliances is larger that value and overall efficiencies."
바이오차의 시용이 채소 유묘 생장 및 양분 흡수량에 미치는 영향,2020,"['Biochar', 'Chinese cabbage', 'Lettuce', 'Red pepper', 'Seedling']",,"BACKGROUND: Biochar is used in various environmental fields, such as water quality and soil restoration, and affects soil fertility and nutrient cycling. Also, when crops are grown on biochar-applied soil, their characteristics may be affected. Biochar is used especially with commercial vegetable seedlings.METHODS AND RESULTS: The objective of this study was to determine the effects of biochar content in seeding mixes on early growth of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa L.), and red pepper (Capsicum annuum L.). Treatments consisted of a control (0: 10, ratio of biochar to seeding mixes (w/w)), 1: 9 (biochar 10%), 3: 7 (biochar 30%), 5: 5 (biochar 50%), and 7: 3 (biochar 70%). The biochar was made from risk husk and had a C/N ratio of 104. As the mixing ratio of biochar increased, pH increased whereas EC and nitrogen content decreased. The highest phosphorus content was with the treatment of 30% biochar, while there were significant increases in the weight of lettuce seedlings and concentrations of T-N, P2O5, K2O, MgO, and Na with the treatments of 30% and 50% biochar. Although the weight of Chinese cabbage seedlings increased with the treatment of 10% biochar, the increase was not statistically significant. Also, there was an increase in the weight of red pepper seedlings with the treatment of 30% biochar, but the increase was not statistically significant. With increases in the biochar mixing ratio, the K2O concentration of red pepper seedlings increased, but the concentrations of P2O5, CaO, MgO, and Na decreased. It was believed that this was because of absorption inhibition by calcium-phosphate formation in the seeding mixes owing to increased pH. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, adding biochar to seeding mixes is considered to be an important mean for growing healthy vegetable seedlings. More field experiments are needed to verify the effect of biochar on vegetable crop growth over the entire growing season."

'Attā' in 'Anattā' refers to the eternal, unchanging, and metaphysical substance (Ātman) as argued by Upaniṣads. I have found that five aggregates (pañcakkhadhā) are not the metaphysical substance and that there is no such unchanging substance, by examining mainly The Characteristic of Nonself (S22:59) and the Dependent Origination.The Stream-enterer (Sotāpanna) who achieved the first Enlightenment removed the first three fetters (saṃyojanā) ― personality view (sakkāyadiṭṭhi), doubt (vicikicchā), and clinging to rites and ceremonies (sīlabbataparāmāsa) among the five lower fetters (pañca orambhāgiyāni saṃyojanāni). The 'personality view' is what views five aggregates as Self (attā). The Stream-enterer is the first Noble One who gained the view that each of five aggregates is not Self.The Once-returner (Sakadāgāmī) who achieved the second Enlightenment does not remove any fetters, but sensual desire (kāmarāga) that is a kind of greed (lobha) and ill will (paṭigha) that is a kind of anger (dosa) weakened. The reason why greed and anger weakened was that delusion (moha) that was their cause or condition weakened. This delusion is the main cause that causes us to see five aggregates as Self. Thus it can be said that the achievement of Once-returner is also related to the insight into Nonself.The Non-returner (Anāgāmī) who achieved the third Enlightenment removed the two remaining fetters ― sensual desire and ill will among the five lower fetters. These sensual desire and ill will are other expressions for greed and anger. The fact that he removed greed and anger means that he removed delusion which is its cause or condition. The fact that he removed the delusion that there was Self means that the insight into Nonself deepened.The Arahant who achieved the fourth and final Enlightenment removed the five higher fetters (pañca uddhamghāgiyāni saṃyojanāni) ― desire for fine material existence (rūparāga), desire for immaterial existence (arūparāga), conceit (māna), restlessness (uddhacca), and ignorance (avijjā). The fact that he removed ignorance or delusion means that he had a perfect insight into whatever is in mind and matter (nāma-rūpa) is not an unchanging substance, and that he mastered the truth of Nonself. The Arahant who mastered Nonself perfectly came to remove the remaining fetters ― desire for fine material existence, desire for immaterial existence, conceit, and restlessness. Therefore it can be concluded that Nonself is the beginning and end of Enlightenment."

This worldview was first introduced by S. Kierkegaard, a Danish philosopher in the 19th century. It is divided into atheistic and so humanistic existentialism, denying the existence of God and theistic existentialism which acknowledges that of God. This worldview is still very active because it has some attractive and strong aspects but it has critically weak points, too. This article, therefore, discusses the concrete contents of atheistic and theistic existentialism first and then mentions the representative atheistic thinkers such as J. P. Sartre and A. Camus and theistic thinkers such as S. Kierkegaard, K. Jaspers and G. Marcel. After that, not only its strong aspects but also its weak and self-contradictory points are investigated. In conclusion, an attempt is made to offer alternatives to the weak points from the Christian worldview."

The purpose of this study is to identify and classify the main characteristics of user behavior of smartphone cameras in Generation Z. Understanding the group behaviors of smartphone camera users can be useful for UX design development of smartphone cameras and related services.Methods : We conducted a case study of smartphone camera apps preferred by Generation Z and identified the main characteristics of the apps. Based on these findings, we organized preliminary surveys to understand the overall camera usage and to select proper interviewees. In an interview, we asked questions related to motivation, context, and behavior and analyzed the common responses through affinity diagrams. Then, we conducted the second survey and ask the participants to respond on how the derived features correspond to them using a five-point scale. Finally, we used the K-means algorithm to classify the categories of camera use behaviors and derived the prominent responses of each type.Results : The characteristics of smartphone camera usage of Generation Z are classified into six categories: ‘convenience’, ‘memory record’,‘artist’s expression’, ‘communication’, ‘naturalness’, and ‘consciousness ofothers’. Group A was mostly female (90%), which shows high levels of ‘convenience’and ‘memory records’ in camera usage. They mainly produce content for selfsatisfaction and tend to avoid complicated steps in shooting and editing. Group B is also female (76%) with high levels of all categories except ‘memory record’. They take pictures and edit them according to their own tastes and upload them to SNS to use feed as their self-branding space. Group C is mostly male (93%) with high levels of ‘convenience’, ‘communication’, and ‘naturalness’. They tend to create visual content to communicate with the people around them, and hence, it is easy for them to shoot and edit.Conclusions : This study derives six characteristics and three categories of smartphone camera usage behavior of Generation Z.

As many point out, the 1990s form an inflection point in the history of Korean pop music. In this article, I examines the introduction of electronic instruments and digital equipment that drove these changes, and the resulting changes and the meaning of musical production method, and the social and cultural context in which musicians who practiced this music could claim their differences and diversity.Specifically, it analyzes the material, human, and socio-economic contexts and background in which the three songs of ‘I know’(난 알 아요) by Seotaiji and Boys, ‘I didn’t say so’(그렇게 말하지 않았어)by Noisegarden and ‘Lad of Sea’(바다 사나이) by No Brain. The three examples show that the imagination of music itself has changed completely as the media of music working tools, distribution and communication media have changed to digital and the internet. This is an important point that shows that the change of media is also the change in content. At the same time, it also reveals that the new media have similar format but different uses and values depending on the social and cultural context in which media operate."

Recognizing that Korean and Chinese pop music has not been placed on the comparative list of studies together despite their historically close correlation, this study aims to reveal the development patterns of modern pop songs in Korea and China and explore new areas of research.  The invasion of Western powers, which began at the end of the 19th century, opened the doors of China, and Korea also began to undergo drastic social changes due to Japanese aggression and colonial rule. In the process of spreading capitalist culture centered on Western Europe and Japan, Korean and Chinese pop music developed into diverse forms through fusion and harmony, not the dichotomy between traditional and foreign styles.  In the 1930s, K-pop and Chinese pop developed with the popularity of ‘Shin Minyo’ and ‘Shin Min-ga’ based on their respectively traditional folk songs.  In this text, we will look at the musical content of Korea’s “Shin Minyo” and China’s “Shin Min-ga,” which were widely sung in the 1930s and 40s and is an important part of pop music. At Japanese colonial period, 〈ours〉 exist in the two countries pop songs which fill with the public longing and desire, strive to succeed the trails of the traditional folk songs and attach meaning to look at nationalization of pop songs and Popularization and Cultural Phenomenon.

AWBA was developed to overcome the limitations of existing posture risk assessment tools in evaluating such agricultural work postures. AWBA consisted of selecting upper-limb posture and lower-limb posture from AULA (Agricultural Whole-Body Assessment) and ALLA (Agricultural Lower-Limb Assessment). Since AWBA did not consider the workload, there was a limitation in assessing workloads and weights.Method: The modification of AWBA was conducted based on the compression force of the lumbar disc computed by 3D-SSPP software. According to working type (onehanded and two-handed) and weight (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10kg), the lumbar disc compression force was used to subdivide the current risk levels of AWBA. K-means analysis was used to subdivide each level, and the number of sub-levels was decided by the Nbclust package in Rstudio. For comparison between tools, the posture risk of 30 agricultural works was evaluated according to the height of the working point.Results: Based on the current level of AWBA, level 1 and level 2 were divided into three sub-levels, and level 3 and level 4 were divided into four. A total of 11 tables were newly created according to the existing AWBA""s posture combination and workload type. As a result of comparing the posture risk assessment results according to the height of the working point, AWBA and Revised AWBA evaluated higher than other tools at the lower working point.Conclusion: Revised AWBA was modified by subdividing the existing AWBA results based on the lumbar compression force only. Therefore, in further studies, Re-AWBA would be improved by collecting various biomechanical data according to each posture and workload.Application: Revised AWBA could be used more effectively than existing tools for evaluating the risk in agricultural work. It is believed that it would help eliminate the risk factors that exist in agricultural sites."

Switzer), 하버트 앤더슨과 케네스 미첼(Herbert Anderson & Kenneth R. Mitchell), 스테판 프리만(Stephen J. Freeman)이 제안들을 고찰하고 더 나아가 상실 극복 애도 상담의 과정들을 목회 상담적 차원에서 새롭게 제안하려 한다. 본 고에서는 이러한 연구 과정을 통하여 일상을 상실한 슬픔을 애도하는 과정이 일반 개인뿐만 아니라 크리스천에게도 본인의 신앙을 점검하고 성장시킬 수 있는 기회가 될 수 있음을 분석할 것이다. 만일 보울비가 주장하는 안정애착과 같은 경험을 개인이 교회공동체 안에서 지속적으로 체험할 수 있다면, 갑작스러운 일상 상실로 인한 슬픔도 안전기지(secure base)인 교회 공동체 안에 쏟아놓고 함께 울고 웃는 건강한 애도가 가능하기 때문이다. 개인은 누구나 삶의 여정 가운데 갑자기 겪게 되는 상실의 슬픔에서 자유롭지 못하다. 그러나 개인이 상실을 경험할 때마다 절망만 할 것이 아니라, 건강한 공동체와 함께 머무르며 애도를 체험할 수 있다면 이후의 삶은 이전보다 더 풍성해지는 전환의 기회가 될 수 있을 것이다.","The purpose of this study is to suggest some roles of the church community from the perspective of pastoral counseling as a way of mourning a sudden, unexpected loss of daily routines. How can the church community help individuals who are going through heavy sorrow associated with the loss of daily living activities due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic The church community and practical theologians have to cope with and research on these concerns more actively, coming up with practical alternatives. To this end, the researcher, in application of John Bowlby's attachment theory, intends to argue that separation anxiety experienced by individuals due to the grief at the loss of daily routines would rather be an opportunity to help the individuals to realize that the true spiritual attachment object is God the Creator. In addition, the church community should be prepared to provide a place of mourning where individuals could experience secure attachment again in appropriate ways - either face-to-face or non-face-to-face - to individuals experiencing separation anxiety caused by the grief at the loss of daily routines. For this purpose, at first, this study is aimed to understand what the sorrow caused by the loss is like. And then, from the perspective of Bowlby's attachment theory, in-depth examination will be conducted on the separation anxiety caused by the sorrow of loss, which, as a means of mourning in a healthy way, will be followed by consideration of a grief counseling process for overcoming loss, along with a further attempt to apply it to the dimension of pastoral counseling, suggested by Charles Bachmann, David K. Switzer, Herbert Anderson, Kenneth R. Mitchell, Stephen J. Freeman. Through this research process, this study will suggest that the process of mourning the loss of daily routines can serve as an opportunity for Christians, let alone ordinary individuals, to examine and develop their own faith. It’s because if an individual can continuously have such experiences as secure attachment introduced by Bowlby within the church community, it would be arguably possible to mourn in a healthy way the grief at the unexpected loss of daily routines, as pouring out the heart of grief, crying and laughing together within a secure base like the church community. None are free from the grief coming from any unexpected, sudden loss in the midst of life journey. Whenever an individual goes through loss, however, if he/she could experience mourning together with a healthy community, instead of being despaired only, afterward a great opportunity of turning life to be more abundant than ever before will be made available."

Towards DES in CFD-based optimization: The case of a sharp U-bend with/without rotation,2020,['· Numerical optimization · Pressure loss · CFD · Rotation · Turbulent flow · U-bend'],,"Channels with a sharp U-bend are typical elements of convective cooling systems designed for blades of high-temperature gas turbines. The flow passing a sharp bend is characterized by a high level of pressure loss that is attributed to development of intensive secondary flows, as well as to formation of a large-size separation adjacent to the divider wall. A considerable reduction of pressure losses can be achieved by proper changes in geometry of the walls forming the U-bend, first of all, in the divider wall geometry. The paper presents results of CFD-based optimization of a stationary or orthogonally rotating U-bend of strong curvature. Baseline geometry is same as used by Cheah et al. (1996) for detailed measurements of U-duct isothermal turbulent flow at the Reynolds number of 10 5 , with and without system rotation. The minimization of the total pressure loss in the bend is achieved by means of a hybrid numerical optimization method that uses design of experiments and a metamodel for fast surrogate modeling of the design space. Optimization databases are produced by incompressible fluid unsteady RANS-(k-w)-SST calculations. Due to optimization of the divider wall profile, the total pressure loss coefficient has been reduced by 47-67 % depending on the rotation number (Ro = 0,±0.2). For the original and the optimized shapes of the bend, simulation is performed also with the eddy-resolving IDDES method validated against the velocity field and pressure measurement data for the original geometry. For optimized shapes, IDDES predicts somewhat lower pressure losses comparing to the RANS model, by 3 to 15 % depending on the rotation number."

DeepCleanNet: Training Deep Convolutional Neural Network with Extremely Noisy Labels,2020,"['Image Classification', 'Noisy Labels', 'Corrupted Labels', 'CNN.']",,"In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been successfully implemented in different tasks of computer vision. Since CNN models are the representatives of supervised learning algorithms, they demand large amount of data in order to train the classifiers. Thus, obtaining data with correct labels is imperative to attain the state-of-the-art performance of the CNN models. However, labelling datasets is quite tedious and expensive process, therefore real-life datasets often exhibit incorrect labels. Although the issue of poorly labelled datasets has been studied before, we have noticed that the methods are very complex and hard to reproduce. Therefore, in this research work, we propose Deep CleanNet - a considerably simple system that achieves competitive results when compared to the existing methods. We use K-means clustering algorithm for selecting data with correct labels and train the new dataset using a deep CNN model. The technique achieves competitive results in both training and validation stages. We conducted experiments using MNIST database of handwritten digits with 50% corrupted labels and achieved up to 10 and 20% increase in training and validation sets accuracy scores, respectively."
VEHICLE DECELERATION PREDICTION BASED ON DEEP NEURAL NETWORK AT BRAKING CONDITIONS,2020,"['Deep neural network model', 'Recurrent neural network model', 'Deceleration characteristics', 'Deceleration types', 'Regenerative torque control', 'Electric vehicles']",,"The smart regenerative braking system in electric vehicles implements automatic control of the regeneration torque of motor to improve driver’s comfort and energy efficiency. To apply this system, the accurate prediction of the vehicle deceleration states is the preliminary step to reflect the driver’s behaviors. In this paper, we proposed a vehicle deceleration prediction model via deep neural network, which consists of a sequential recurrent neural network model with long-short term memory cell and a two-layer conventional neural network model. This model accommodates the physical constraint to designate the vehicle stop location in front of the traffic signals. The model is trained by vehicle experiment data with three drivers through the hyper-parameter optimization method. Using this model, the deceleration characteristics are characterized by two explicit parameters such that deceleration point, maximum point according to the initial slope and the shape of the braking profile. Using these two parameters as clustering variables through a K-means clustering method, the deceleration types are classified. These deceleration types to the input to the prediction model results in higher prediction accuracy of the vehicle states. The driving style of the three drivers at braking situations is analyzed according to the deceleration types as well."
10-15세기 이슬람 세력에 대한 인도 종교의 인식,2020,"['힌두교', '자이나교', '인도 무슬림', '인도 종교', '믈레차', 'Hinduism', 'Jainism', 'Hindu-muslim', 'Indian religions', 'Mleccha']",,"This paper aims to examine how the Indian religions perceived Islam when they had entered and settled in India. Specifically, I studied the religious situation in India before Islam came in. Then I examined the descriptions of Islamic forces found in Hindu and Jaina sources. And then I analysed diverse perceptions between the two traditions stemmed from their different doctrines and religious characteristics. Before the invasion of Islam or their complete conquest in the Indian subcontinent, Indian religions had the golden age in terms of religious thought, culture, and art resulted from the development of Sanskrit literature and temple architecture with the support of local dynasties. However, after the invasion, Islam destroyed various statues and temples since they strictly forbid idolatry, so traditional Indian religious finally lost their patronages. We can find this fearful situation for Indian religions in a variety of Indian literature as they refer to Muslims as Yavana, Mleccha, Śaka, etc., which mean basically ‘barbarians’.  It is noteworthy that Hinduism and Jainism differently adapted to this new environment to coexist with Islam. It is due to different groups who support each religion. While Kṣatriya class sustains brahmins, the prominent supporter of Jainism is Vaiśya class. That is, the invasion of Islamic forces brought about the political and religious decline of local dynasties, so it immediately affected to Hinduism. However, in the case of Jainism, their patronage, whose class mainly engages in commerce, was not directly damaged by the invasion. Moreover, under the influence of this Islam rules, Jainism rather could have a purification movement to return to Jaina asceticism by eliminating tantric features that had affected to Jainism before."
Meticulous three-dimensional demarcation and separate presentation of statistically homogeneous structural domains within a large-scale jointed rock mass,2020,"['homogeneous structural domain', 'meticulous three-dimensional demarcation', 'separate presentation', 'graphical comparison test', 'parametric comparison test']",,"Traditional methods used to demarcate homogeneous structural domains are mainly concerned with small-scale discontinuities; this approach can be regarded as a process for evaluating the degree of homogeneity among stochastic discontinuities from one site to another. This process forms the basis for determining the distribution of stochastic discontinuities within a homogeneous structural domain; however, it neglects large-scale discontinuities. In this study, the statistically homogeneous structural domains within a large-scale jointed rock mass were meticulously demarcated in three dimensions, which was performed in four steps. 1) A three-dimensional discontinuity network model was constructed containing both deterministic and stochastic discontinuities. 2) The model was subsequently discretized into a large number of cubic grids, and the MBi values of all the grids were calculated. 3) Using the K-means algorithm, the structural domain boundaries within the tested rock mass were meticulously demarcated, and a composited model consisting of homogeneous structural domains was constructed. 4) Each homogeneous structural domain was separately visualized. This demarcation method can consider large-scale discontinuities and improve the identification sensitivity in a large-scale jointed rock mass with a high accuracy. Moreover, the separate presentation of structural domains directly reflects the morphological properties unique to each structural domain."
A Wearable Soft Robot for Stroke Patients’ Finger Occupational Therapy and Quantitative Measures on the Joint Paralysis,2020,['Stroke · Hemiplegia · Rehabilitation · Robot therapy · Machine learning'],,"We suggest a wearable soft robot for post-stroke, hemiplegic patients’ finger rehabilitation and quantitative evaluations on the joint paralysis. The device consists of a pair of gloves. One measures finger positions of the normal side, and the other induces symmetric movements on the affected side by pneumatic force. Ten patients at Brunnstrom stage 3 and 4 from a local hospital participated in this study. They performed Rolyan Stacking Cones 10 times with and without the support of the soft robot. We measured subjects’ proximal interphalangeal angles and air pressures in the pneumatic glove during the exercise to monitor grab/release patterns. The soft robot helped open their paralyzed finger joints by more than 50 degrees on average regardless of Brunnstrom stages. We applied pattern recognition methods on the measurement to quantitatively evaluate the subjects. A support vector machine revealed a misclassification rate of 20%, implying that there were a considerable number of overlapping data sets near the boundary between Brunnstrom stages. K-means method with three clusters suggested a new subject group near the support vector machine border. Thus, we conclude that our wearable soft robot not only provides grab/release guides to post-stroke patients but also provides quantitative information on their finger paralysis supplementary to the existing qualitative assessments."

The results are as follows: First, the results reflected key characteristics of the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, namely that the core competencies, education content, and teaching ability of practical arts education were all rated high. Therefore, it can be determined from these results that elementary school teachers recognize that the actual curriculum reflects the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.Second, the K-means cluster analysis showed three types of results. Cluster 1 is the group with the best score for  education content  and  teaching ability . Cluster 2 was derived as a group with a high “core competency” and Cluster 3 was the control group. There were significant differences in core competencies, practical content areas, and teaching abilities for each type. Significant differences were also identified in demographics. It will be necessary to train teachers to develop teaching methods and to be mindful that their approaches suit the characteristics of each group.Third, the requirements for practical arts education are devised from field-related contents that were suitable for the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution. To be more specific, the composition of educational contents are highly related to life, and they are suitable for the level of students. In addition, it is crucial that support for strengthening teachers  competency to enhance the efficiency of practical courses is provided.It is necessary to strengthen teachers  competence by developing and applying the contents of practical arts education suitable for changes in society, such as those established during the Fourth Industrial Revolution, providing customized training support considering the characteristics of teachers, expanding practical support, and providing the necessary data when needed. In the future, the new revised curriculum will have to be generated after thorough reflection and after careful developmental changes are implemented. In addition, various methods of teaching should be developed for non-face-to-face classes, and face-to-face classes."

Z-test 결과에서는 좌·우현 10°일 때 1st Overshoot angle은 우현, 좌현이 각각 평균 6.3°, 9.8°이며 2nd Overshoot angle의 경우, 우현 및 좌현은 각각 15.3°, 9.2°이었다. 이 때 선회성 지수 Kˊ, 추종성 지수 Tˊ는 각각 2.37~2.87, 1.74~3.45의 범위에 있었다. 좌·우현 20°일 경우, 1st Overshoot angle은 우현 및 좌현이 13.7°, 18°이고, 조종성 지수는 선회성이 1.43~1.62, 추종성이 1.0~1.78이었다. Semi-balance rudder를 사용한 타 선박들과 이들 범위를 비교한 결과, Flap rudder의 영향으로 선회성이 높아지고, 추종성은 상대적으로 낮은 것으로 판단된다. Spiral실험에서는 타 중앙을 중심으로 타각 0°의 접선이 타각과 정상 각속도에 비례하는 경향이 보였으며 다소 불안정한 loop폭과 함께, 타 중앙을 중심으로 +0.3° 및 -0.5~-1.1의 범위를 나타내고 있으나, 일반적으로 타각이 0°에서 직진하지 않는 것이 보통이기 때문에 침로안정성 측면에서는 양호한 선박으로 판단된다. 실습선은 학생 실습중 주로 소형어선들이 밀집한 해역에서 관측을 하는 중에 빈번한 정지, 항해, 변침 등을 해야 하는 선박이므로 비록 IMO조종성능 기준에 기초하여 정량적으로 분석한 결과는 전반적으로 만족하지만, 안전항해를 위해서 선박 운항자는 선박의 특성을 주의깊게 확인하면서 주변 해상의 안전운항에 관심을 가져야 할 것이다.","In order to offer specific information needed to assist in operation of a ship with same type rudder through evaluating the maneuverability of training ship A-Ra with flapped rudder, sea trials based full scale for turning test, zig-zag test with rudder angle 10° and 20°, and spiral test at service condition were carried out on starboard and port sides around Jeju Island according to the standards of maneuverability of IMO. As a result, the angular velocity of port turn was higher than that of starboard turn. Therefore, the size of turning circle was longer on the starboard side. In addition, variation of the transfer due to various factors was more stable than those of the others. In the Z-test results, the mean of 1st and 2nd overshoot angles were 9.8°, 6.3° and 15.3°, 9.2° respectively when the port and starboard was 10°; the 1st overshoot angle were 18°, 13.7° when using 20°. Her maneuverability index Tˊ and Kˊ can be easily determined by using a computer with the data obtained from Z-test where Kˊ and Tˊ are dimensionless constants representing turning ability and responsiveness to the helm, respectively. In the Z-test under flap rudder angle 10°, the obtained Kˊ value covered the range of 2.37-2.87 and Tˊ was 1.74-3.45. Under the flap rudder angle 20°, Kˊ and Tˊ value showed 1.43-1.63, 1.0-1.73, respectively. In the spiral test, the loop width was unstable at +0.3° and –0.5°-0.9° around the midship of flap rudder. As a result, course stability was comparatively good. From the sea trial results, training ship ARA met the present criterion in the standards of maneuverability of IMO."

Clustering high-cardinality categorical data using category embedding methods,2020,"['Categorical variable', 'clustering', 'word embedding']",,"Compared to clustering numerical data, clustering algorithms for categorical data have not been extensively studied, particularly for data with high-cardinality attributes. When categorical attributes have a large number of levels, clustering algorithms tend to suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In this study, we verified that a good clustering performance can be achieved in the presence of categorical attributes by com-bining clustering algorithms typically applied to numerical data with word embedding methods. Using word embedding methods that were originally developed for natural language processing, the levels of categorical attributes can be represented in a vector space, where the resulting embedding vectors would reflect the relationship between frequently appearing categories. We utilized Word2vec, GloVe, and fastText for category embedding. We also applied K-means and Gaussian mixture model for clustering the embedded data. The clustering performance of the proposed methods was compared with that of typical clustering algorithms for categorical data, namely, K-mode and robust clustering using links. In a simulation study and experiments employing real-life examples, the Gaussian mixture model with GloVe had the best performance, especially when the number of observations and complexity of data was increased."

Likewise, what is the art of life for the young people of neo-nihilism times which annihilated even their will or hope to get over the annihilation? The starting point of life art for the youth of neo-nihilism times is to introspect the identity of the world where one resides. Further, together with the introspection as to the identity of one’s viewpoint over the world, it is necessary for the youth to have a practical molding corresponding thereto. If so, what type of life is the real one to harmonize introspection and molding? A short story which keenly describes before, after, and between a bout of match against the Sirens who are the absolutely unrivaled stronger is Franz Kafka’s “The Silence of the Sirens(Das Schweigen der Sirenen)”. Nietzsche also presents survival technique getting over nihilistic times as an extreme pessimist no less than Kafka. He confronts the truth of life which looks horrible and presents survival craft playing with it. This is ‘Dionysian artist(Dionysischer Künstler)’ presented by Nietzsche’s “Dionysian world view(Die Dionysische Weltanschauung)”. This is the art distinguished from Apollo(the god of dream) or Dionysus(the god of euphoria(Rausch))which are known widely through The Birth of Tragedy. It is the art playing with both instead of being caught in dream or euphoria. In this paper, this writer will catch the art of survival in the absolute poverty of N-po times through Kafka’s insufficient and childish means, and reinterpret philosophically it through three types of artstes in Nietzsche."

One cannot say that all separate tax laws must apply the same rule, considering the different legislative purposes of the local tax law, which regulates the acquisition tax, and the corporate tax law and income tax law, which regulate the capital gains tax. Moreover, each tax law will be regulated according to its own policy purpose. However, although the purposes of separate tax laws are different, it is desirable to maintain uniformity in the provisions of separate tax laws unless there is a special reason to stipulate otherwise. Despite the different regulations of separate tax laws, they should be interpreted with a consistent logic for suitable purposes. If the separate tax laws do not provide timely and specific regulations, the authorities can establish a more rational taxation system by supplementally applying the provisions of fair and reasonable corporate accounting standards.Since the local tax law does not provide specific regulations regarding the interest on borrowings for construction funds, it would be reasonable to supplement and interpret the accounting standards that are generally recognized as fair and proper. But there is a problem that the tax base of acquisition tax may vary depending on the different accounting standards of each enterprise such as K-IFRS(Korean-International Financial Reporting Standards) or GAAP(Generally Accepted Accounting Principles). The asset value at the acquisition stage, which becomes the tax base of acquisition tax, can be used as a standard for calculating the tax paying ability in the process of acquiring taxable goods.Adding the interest on construction period to the acquisition value of the assets subject to acquisition tax means that it is regarded as an increase in the tax paying ability. However, the incurred interest during the construction period has no correlation to the ability to pay taxes in the acquisition process. Therefore, it would be desirable to revise related regulations so that the interest on construction period does not change the tax base of acquisition tax. But the current local tax law regulates the interest on construction period as an indirect cost included in the acquisition value. So on the premise of this, it would be reasonable not to include the interest incurred during the period of construction suspension in the tax base of the acquisition tax, considering the relevance to the acquisition of buildings, the real aspect of formal interest expenses, the vertical and the horizontal equity, and the supplementary application of corporate accounting standards."

K-mean clustering을 이용하여 18개 탐방로를 유형 분류한 결과, 태백산국립공원의 탐방로는 눈축제에 영향을 받는 유형(유형 1)과, 가까운 거리에 볼거리가 많아 비산행 탐방객이 많은 유형(유형 2), 그리고 산행을 목적으로 온 탐방객들이 대부분인 유형(유형3)의 3개 유형을 분류할 수 있었다. 탐방로 유형별 탐방객 행태와 불법 행위 유형이 다르므로, 유형별 특성에 맞춰 탐방로관리방안을 마련하여야 할 것이다.","This study built a model to predict the daily number of visitors to 18 trails in the Taebaeksan National Park using the auto-counter system data to analyze the factors affecting the daily number of visitors to each trail and classified the trails by visitors’ behaviors. Results of the multiple regression models with the daily number of visitors of the 18 trails indicated that the events, such as the National Foundation Day celebration of Snow Festival, affected the number of visitors of all of the 18 trails and were the most critical factor that determined the daily number of visitors to the Taebaeksan National Park. The long-holidays of three days or longer and other national holidays also affected the daily number of visitors to the trails. Precipitation had a negative impact on the number of visitors of trails where the intention of most visitors was for sightseeing or camping instead of hiking, whereas had no significant impacts on the number of visitors of trails where many visitors intended for hiking. It indicated that visitors who intended for hiking went ahead hiking even if the weather was poor. The effects of temperature had a positive effect on the number of visitors who intended for hiking but a negative effect on the number of visitor to the trails near Danggol Plaza where the Snow Festival was held in each winter, suggesting that the impact of the Snow Festival was the deterministic factor for trail management. Results of K-mean clustering showed that the 18 trails of the Taekbaeksan National Park could be classified into three types: those affected by the Snow Festival (type 1), those that have sightseeing points and so were visited mostly by non-hikers (type 2), and those visited mostly by hikers (type 3). Since visitor behaviors and illegal actions differ according to the trail type, this study’s results can be used to prepare a trail management plan based on the trail characteristics."
Does work time limit for resident physician affect short-term treatment outcome and hospital length of stay in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage?: a two-year experience at a single training hospital in South Korea,2020,"['Work hour restriction', 'Resident', 'Mortality', 'Outcome', 'Length of stay']",,"Objective: To compare short-term treatment outcomes at hospital discharge and hospital length of stay (LOS) in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) before and after introduction of resident physician work time limit (WTL).Methods: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients treated for sICH at our institution between 2016 and 2019. Then we dichotomized these patients into two groups, pre-WTL and post-WTL. We analyzed demographic elements and clinical features, and hospital length of stay (LOS). We evaluated short-term outcome using modified Rankin scale score at hospital discharge and then divided it into “good” and “poor” outcome groups. We subsequently, compared short-term treatment outcome and hospital LOS between the pre-WTL and post-WTL groups.Results: Out of 779 patients, 420 patients (53.9%) were included in the pre-WTL group, and 359 (46.1%) in post-WTL. The mortality rate in sICH patients was higher in the post-WTL group (pre-WTL; 13.6% vs. post-WTL; 17.3%), but there was no statistically significant difference in short-term outcome including mortality (p=0.332) between the groups. The LOS also, was not significantly different between the two groups (pre-WTL; 19.0 days vs. post-WTL; 20.2 days) (p=0.341). The initial Glasgow Coma Scale score, personal stroke history, and mean age were the only independent outcome predicting factors for patients with sICH.Conclusions: Some neurosurgeons may expect poorer outcome for sICH after implementation of the WTL of the K-MHW for resident physician however, enforcement of the WTL did not significantly influence the short-term outcome and hospital LOS for sICH in our hospital. Further well-designed multi-institutional prospective studies on the effects of WTL in sICH patient outcome, are anticipated."
대행선사의 간화看話와 주인공 관법에 대한 고찰 - 간화선과의 관계를 중심으로,2020,"['간화선', '대행선', '화두', '주인공', '관법', '의정']","본 연구에서는 대행선사의 간화에 대한 이해를 위해 먼저 화두가 가진 의미를 방편과 실상의 두 가지 차원에서 살펴보았다. 그러나 이 두 개념을 잘못 이해하면 상호모순이 생겨나기 때문에 먼저 이 두 개념이 상호보완적 관계임을 논술하였다. 또한 실상의 입장에서 화두는 ‘한 생각 일어나기 이전’을 가리키기 때문에 이 두 개념을 대립적으로 파악할 수 없다는 점도 살펴보았다. 이와 같이 화두를 실상으로 이해하는 방식을 통해 대행선의 ‘간화’를 이해할 수 있는 해석의 틀로 삼았다. 본문에서는 이러한 해석의 틀을 기준으로 크게 세 가지 관점에서 논의하였다. 우선 전통적 의미의 간화선은 방편의 입장이 강조된 것에 비해 대행선사의 화두에 대한 해석과 이해는 주로 실상을 바탕으로 하고 있음에 주목하였다. 둘째, 대행선사의 화두에 대한 이해를 실상의 차원에서 접근하면 선사의 주인공 관법과 화두와의 관계를 이해할 수 있다. 일반적인 화두 참구가 화두를 통해 의심을 내는 것에 초점이 맞추어져 있다면 스님의 화두는 자기의 성품으로 마음을 돌리는 ‘관’을 말한다. 스님은 화두와 참선 그리고 관觀을 하나로 보았다. 마지막으로 전통적 의미의 간화선과 대행선의 ‘간화’와의 관계를 살펴보았다. 전통적 의미의 간화선이 대신근, 대분지, 대의단의 세 가지 요소를 강조하는 것에 비해 대행 스님의 ‘간화’는 이에 ‘관’을 추가시킨 것이라고 볼 수 있다. 특히 이를 초기∙상좌부 불교의 수행 과정에서 중시하는 오근∙오력의 개념과 비교해보면 전통적인 의미의 간화선과 그 차이점이 분명하게 드러난다. 대행선의 간화에서 신信은 실상을 깨치는 근원적 요소이며 이는 ‘관’으로 이어진다. 이러한 맥락에서 ‘관’은 간화선에서 강조하는 ‘대의단’에 해당한다고 볼 수 있다. 대행선에서도 ‘의정’은 존재하지만 전통적 의미의 간화선에서 나타나는 것만큼 중시되지 않는다.","In order to understand Daehaeng's practice of ganhwa (看話 observation of a key phrase; koan meditation), I first examined from two different perspectives the definition of ‘hwadu’ (話頭 key phrase/koan) in terms of its relevance to ‘true original nature’ (實相 true reality of things as they are) and ‘expedient means’ (方便 Skt. upāya). If we misunderstand these two concepts, it leads to mutual contradictions, so I must explain first the point that the two concepts are complementary. Also, from the standpoint of true original nature, ‘hwadu’ can be interpreted as means 'before a thought arises in an inherently undefiled mind’. Therefore, we should not understand these two concepts to be contradictory or in opposition. In this framework, I tried to explain Ven. Daehaeng’s ganhwa practice in terms of true original nature (the true reality of things as they are). In this paper I examined ganhwa-seon [看話禪 Gong'an (J. kōan) contemplation; a Chan/Seon/Zen meditation method that seeks direct attainment of enlightenment through investigation of the 'keyword 話頭'] from three perspectives based on the following interpretations. First of all, I noted that the traditional interpretation and understanding of ganhwa-seon emphasized ‘expedient means’, whereas Ven. Daehaeng mainly stressed its relationship to ‘true original nature’. Second, if we understand Daehaeng's interpretation of ‘hwadu’ in terms of true original nature, we can understand the relationship between her practice of ‘juingong’ (主人空 one's own pristine inner-self or self-nature) contemplation and traditional hwadu contemplation. If ganhwa-seon is focused on amassing doubt through hwadu contemplation, then Daehaeng's hwadu practice emphasizes the ‘gwan’ (觀 Skt. vipaśyanā, meditative insight, analytical meditation, or observation meditation) aspect more by focusing one’s mind on its own true nature. Ven. Daehaeng understood hwadu practice, seon practice and gwan practice to be one and the same. Lastly, I examined the relationship between traditional ganhwa-seon and Ven. Daehaeng's version of it. While traditional ganhwa-seon emphasizes the three elements of great faith, great effort, and great doubt, Ven. Daehaeng's ‘ganhwa’ emphasizes ‘gwan' or ’observation’. In particular, when we compare this with the concepts of the ‘five spiritual faculties’ (五根) and ‘five spiritual powers’ (五力), important concepts in Early and Theravada Buddhism, then the differences between Ven. Daehaeng’s ganhwa and traditional ganhwa seon become clear. ‘Great faith’ in Ven. Daehaeng's ganhwa is the fundamental element in realizing one’s true original nature, which leads to 'gwan'. In this context, 'gwan' corresponds to the 'great doubt' emphasized in traditional ganhwa-seon. In ‘Daehaeng seon’, 'great doubt' exists, but it is not as important as it is in traditional ganhwa-seon."
Doped Two-dimensional Semiconductor Superlattice: Photo-stimulated Quantum Thermo-magnetoelectric Effects under the Influence of a Confined Phonon,2020,"['Photo-stimulated quantum thermo-magnetoelectric effects', 'Doped two-dimentional semiconductor superlattice', 'Quantum Ettingshausen coefficient', 'Quantum Peltier coefficient', 'Quantum kinetic equation', 'Confined phonon', 'Conductivity tensor', 'Thermo-electric tensor', 'Kinetic tensor']",,"Photo-stimulated quantum thermo-magnetoelectric effects in doped two-dimensional semiconductor superlattices, including the photo-stimulated quantum Ettingshausen effect and the photo-stimulated quantum Peltier effect, have been theoretically studied by using the quantum kinetic equation method. In this work, we assume that the electron-confined acoustic phonon scattering is essential. Moreover, the presence of the laser radiation (LR) is also taken into account to determine the influence of confined phonons on the aforementioned effects. We have defined the analytical expressions for the kinetic tensors and the Ettingshausen and the Peltier coefficients, presented the numerically calculated the theoretical results for the GaAs:Si/GaAs:Be doped semiconductor superlattice and compared them with these for the case of an unconfined acoustic phonon. The results obtained indicated that the formulas for the kinetic tensors, the Ettingshausen coefficient (EC) and the Peltier coefficient (PC) contain the quantum number m specifying the confinement of a phonon and approach the results for an unconfined phonon as m goes to zero. We found that the kinetic tensors, the EC and the PC oscillate with changing magnetic field and that the confinement of a phonon causes a shift of the peaks in these oscillations to lower energy. The dependences of both EC and PC on the temperature were found to be nonlinear. Moreover, all the coefficients level off when the temperature was less than 4.5 K or greater than 5.5 K. The EC also depended on the doping concentration in a nonlinear way and reaches a positive constant value when the semiconductor superlattice was doped with a high concentration. Most of the numerical results showed that the magnitude of the tensors, the EC as well as the PC, within a confined acoustic phonon varie significantly in comparison with the unconfined phonon case. This means that the confinement of the phonon affects the thermo-magnetoelectric effect quantitatively and qualitatively.These results contribute to completing the theory of the thermo-magnetoelectric effects in the low-dimensional semiconductor systems."
Critique of the Theory of Nature (xing) and Principle (li) in the Philosophy of Zhu Xi: Matteo Ricci and Chŏng Yagyong,2020,"['the supreme ultimate (taiji)', 'principle (li)', 'cause or the reason for the existence and operation of qi (suoyi)', 'human nature (xing)', 'appetite or preference/proclivity [for the moral good] (sŏng kiho)']",,"Taking recourse to the Aristotelian theory of four causes and the distinction between substance and accidents, as well as to the concept of intellectual consciousness (lingjue 靈覺), Matteo Ricci (Li Madou 利瑪竇, 1552–1610) argued that the notions of taiji 太極 and li 理 as expounded by Zhu Xi 朱熹 (1130–1200) cannot serve as the origin of existence, as their metaphysical equivalent God, does in Catholic Christianity. Taiji and li do not have consciousness and are moreover merely “accidents.” Unlike “substance,” an “accident” is something that is not essential for something to be what it is. Tasan Chŏng Yagyong 茶山 丁若鏞 (1762– 1836) follows Ricci in claiming that li is but an accident, and no more than the “formal cause” of each individual object. A “formal cause” is what something is or should be, as distinct from the “material cause” (that of which it is made), the “efficient cause” (that which gives it shape or motion), or the “final cause” (the goal for which it is intended). Ricci and Tasan did not acknowledge the role of li as the “principle, ground, cause or the reason for the existence and operation of qi 氣” (suoyi 所以) as held by Zhu Xi’s school of nature and principle. Like Ricci, Tasan also dismissed the concept of taiji as “the undifferentiated state before heaven and earth came to be divided.” However, Tasan diverged markedly from Ricci with respect to the critique of the tenet “Nature is in fact principle (Xing ji li 性卽理)”. Although Tasan and Ricci both separated xing 性 from li and deconstructed the meaning of xing from its connotation of original moral human nature, Tasan’s reconstructed xing is quite different from Ricci’s understanding “nothing other than the fundamental (ben 本) essence (ti 體) of each category of things.” Tasan’s unique contribution is his new definition of xing (K. sŏng) as the appetite or preference/proclivity [for the moral good] (K. kiho, C. shihao 嗜好), which is quite Mencian in its affirmation of the presence of an incipient tendency toward the good in human beings. That he mentions that this xing (K. sŏng), although divested of its a priori metaphysical connotations, is still mandated and bestowed by heaven as stated in the Zhongyong 中庸 [Doctrine of the Mean] further testifies to Tasan’s continued engagement with the classics."
요한복음에 등장하는 영광 언어,2020,"['The Gospel of John', 'glory', 'honor', 'the glory of Logos', 'the glory of the cross', '요한복음', '영광', '명예', '로고스의 영광', '십자가의 영광']","본 연구는 요한복음에 등장하는 영광 언어에 대한 연구다. 요한복음에는 영광 언어가 많이 등장하고 중요한 개념임에도 불구하고 이 주제와 관련된 연구는 이제까지 많지 않았다. 이 언어를 네 가지로 분류하는 쾨스텐베르거의 연구는 많은 통찰력을 주지만, 그의 분석은 비교적 간단하고 철저하지 못한 약점과 함께 요한복음에 분명히 기록되어 있는 선재한 로고스로서의 예수의 영광에 대해(17:5a; 17:22; 17:24) 고려하지 않으므로 수정이 필요하다. 따라서 필자는 본 연구를 통해 쾨스텐베르거의 분류를 보완했다.먼저 필자는 요한복음의 영광 언어를 분류하되 이 단어의 의미에 따라 두 가지로 분류했다. 헬라어 는 두 가지 주요 의미를 가지는데 첫째는 “영광(glory)”이고 두 번째는 “명예, 명성, 의견(honor, reputation, opinion)”이다. 전자는 하나님의 임재로부터 뿜어져 나오는 가시적인 밝음이나 광채를 가리키거나 하나님의 성품의 계시를 통해 나타나는 불가시적인 그의 영광을 가리킨다. 요한복음 1:14, 2:11, 11:40, 12:41이 이 경우에 해당하고, 이 경우 하나님이나 예수의 성품, 모습, 행동을 통해 드러나는 신적 영광을 의미한다. 이 경우에는 빈번하게 가 “보다”라는 동사와 함께 사용되는 특징이 있다. 의 두 번째 의미인 “명예”는 요한복음에서 흔히 “영광을 취함”, “영광을 구함”, “영광을 돌림”이라는 표현으로 사용된다. 이런 경우 하나님이나 사람으로부터 칭찬이나 찬양을 받거나 높임을 받는 행위를 가리킨다. 이 범주에 속하는 구절들이 첫 번째 경우보다 훨씬 많은데, 5:41, 5:44(x2), 7:18(x2), 8:50, 8:54(x3), 9:24, 12:43(x2), 17:4; 17:5a, 17:5b, 17:22, 17:24가 이 경우에 해당한다.다음으로 필자는 영광 언어가 구체적으로 표현되는 방식에 따라 다음 여섯 가지로 분류했다. 첫째, 요한복음에서 영광 언어는 성부께서 허락하신 선재한 로고스로서의 예수의 영광을 가리키는 데 사용된다(17:5a; 17:22; 17:24). 둘째, 표적을 포함한 공생애 동안 예수가 행한 여러 기적을 통한 예수의 영광이다(1:14; 2:11; 11:4; 11:40; 12:28). 셋째, 요한이 이 언어를 통해 가장 많이 묘사하는 사건은 예수의 십자가 사건이다(7:39; 12:16; 12:23; 12:28(x3); 12:41; 13:31-32(x5); 17:1(x2)). 넷째, 성령을 통한 예수의 영광이다(16:14). 다섯째, 제자들을 통한 성부와 성자의 영광이다(14:13; 15:8; 17:10; 21:19). 마지막으로 사람의 영광과 하나님의 영광이 대조되어 나타난다(5:41; 5:44(x2); 7:18(x2); 8:50; 8:54(x3); 9:24; 12:43(x2)).","This study examines the language of doxa in the Gospel of John. Although the language of doxa occurs many times in the Gospel of John and is an important concept, there have been not many studies on this subject. Köstenberger’s four categories of this language of doxa give a lot of insight. But his analysis has two weaknesses. First, it does not provide a thorough analysis. Second, it omits the category of the glory of preexistent Logos which is mentioned in this Gospel (17:5a; 17:22; 17:24). Therefore, I supplemented his classification through this study.First, I classified the doxa language of John’s Gospel according to the meaning of this word. The Greek word doxa has two main meanings: the first is “glory” and the second is “honor”, “reputation”, or “opinion.” The former refers to the visible light or brilliance emanating from God’s presence, or to the invisible glory of God through the revelation of his character. John 1:14, 2:11, 11:40, 12:41 belong to this case, and these references mean the divine glory revealed through the character, appearance, and behavior of God or Jesus. In this category, doxa is frequently used with the verb “see.” The second meaning of doxa, “honor,” is often used in the Gospel of John with the words “to take the glory”, “to seek glory,” or “turn glory.” In this category, it refers to the act of receiving praise or exaltation from God or man. There are far more references in this category than in the first category. John 5:41, 5:44 (x2), 7:18 (x2), 8:50, 8:54 (x3), 9:24, 12:43 (x2), 17:4, 17:5a, 17:5b, 17:22, 17:24 fall into this category.Next, I classified the doxa language ​​into the following six categories in terms of its manners that it is expressed. First, in the Gospel of John, the language of doxa is used to refer to Jesus’ glory as a preexisting Logos (17:5a; 17:22; 17:24). Second, it is Jesus’ doxa through the many miracles Jesus performed during his earthly life, including the signs (1:14; 2:11; 11:4; 11:40; 12:28). Third, the events that John describes most in the language of doxa are Jesus’ crucifixion (7:39; 12:16; 12:23; 12:28 (x3); 12:41; 13:31-32 (x5); 17:1 (x2)). Fourth, it is Jesus’ doxa through the Holy Spirit (16:14). Fifth, the doxa of the Father and the Son through the disciples (14:13; 15:8; 17:10; 21:19). Finally, the doxa of human and the doxa of God appear in contrast (5:41; 5:44 (x2); 7:18 (x2); 8:50; 8:54 (x3); 9:24; 12:43 (x2))."
첨성대 이름의 의미 해석,2020,"['도리천(忉利天)', '삼도보계(三道寶階)', '묘탑(廟塔)', '밀교(密敎)', '관정경(灌頂經)']","첨성대의 본질에 관한 현재의 가장 보편적인 가설은 천문관측대설이다. 천문관측설의 근거는 주장하는 학자들마다 약간씩 차이가 있지만, 가장 중요한 근거는 ‘첨성대’라는 이름이며, 이에 대한 타당한 비판은 지금까지 제기된 바가 없다. 본 연구는 ‘첨성대’에 내포된 의미를 밝히고, ‘첨성대’가 천문관측대설의 타당한 근거인지를 살펴보았다.천문관련설은 ‘첨성대’를 주로 ‘첨+성+대’로 해석했다. ‘볼 첨(瞻)’자와 ‘별 성(星)’자와 ‘대 대(臺)’자의 조합인 ‘첨성대’는 ‘천문을 관측한 대’를 뜻한다고 주장해왔다. 한편 종교관련설은 ‘별 성’은 ‘하늘 천(天)’을 의미하며, 첨성대에서 바라본 ‘하늘’은 불교의 천상세계인 도리천이었다고 주장해왔다. 본 연구는 󰡔삼국유사󰡕(1289±) 이전의 중국기록에서 ‘첨성’의 용례들을 살펴보았다. ‘첨성’에 내포된 의미는 매우 다양하게 드러났다. ‘첨성+대’는 서술의 맥락에 따라서 ‘천문을 관측한 대’를 뜻할 수도 있고, ‘도리천을 우러러본 대’를 뜻할 수도 있었다. 또한 ‘첨성’이 힌두교, 유교, 불교, 천주교, 도교와 같은 다양한 종교적 배경으로 실행되었음을 알 수가 있었고, 불교의 ‘첨성’은 적어도 외도(外道)의 ‘첨성’, 법도(法道)의 ‘첨성’, 세속(世俗)의 ‘첨성’으로 나눠질 수가 있음을 알게 되었다. 서술의 맥락에 따라서 ‘첨성+대’에 내포된 의미는 상당히 달라질 수가 있는 것이다.󰡔삼국유사󰡕에 서술된 첨성대의 본질은 선덕여왕의 도리천장례를 위한 묘탑(廟塔)으로 드러났다. 선덕여왕의 도리천장례와 문무왕대의 사천왕사건립은 신종원(1996)의 견해대로 밀교승려 안함(=안홍)에 의해 예언되었고, 󰡔삼국유사󰡕가 인용한 󰡔별기󰡕는 안함(=안홍)의 참서(=예언서)로 드러났다. 선덕여왕릉과 첨성대의 배치가 동지일출선에 정확하게 맞춰져 있음은 첨성대가 선덕여왕 유혼의 도리천 상생통로였기 때문으로 판단되었다. 첨성대는 도리천으로 통하는 삼도보계(三道寶階)와 같은 ‘천국의 계단’를 가진 불탑이었고, ‘첨성대’는 󰡔삼국유사󰡕 왕력편의 ‘점성대’와 마찬가지로 ‘도리천을 우러러본 대’라는 의미로 파악되었다. ‘첨성대’라는 이름은 천문관측대설의 근거가 될 수 없으며, 오히려 천문관련설을 총체적으로 부정할 수 있는 하나의 중요한 근거로 새롭게 평가되어야 마땅할 것이다.","CheomSeongDae(瞻星臺) is a stone structure built in Gyeongju, the former Silla Dynasty capital, during the reign(632~647) of Queen Seondeok. There exist dozens of hypotheses regarding its original purpose. Depending on to whom you ask, the answer could be a celestial observatory, a religious altar, a Buddhist stupa, a monumental tower symbolizing scientific knowledge, and so on. The most common conception of the structure among lay people is a star gazing tower. Historians, however, have suggested that it was a gateway to heavens, specifically the Trāyastriṃśa or the second of the six heavens of Kāmadhātu located on the top of Mountain Sumeru.  The name of Cheom-seong-dae could be interpreted in many different ways. ‘Cheom(瞻)’ could mean looking up, staring, admiring, etc. ‘Seong(星)’ could mean star, heaven, night, etc.; and the heaven can be a physical or religious one. ‘Dae(臺)’ usually refers to a high platform on which people stand or things are placed. Researchers from the science fields often read ‘cheom-seong’ as ‘looking at stars’; while historians read it as ‘admiring the Trāyastriṃśa’ or ‘adoring Śakra’. Śakra is the ruler of Trāyastriṃśa’ and governs the Four Heavenly Kings in the Cāturmahārājika heaven, the first of the six heavens of Kāmadhātu. Śakra is the highest authority of the heavenly kings in direct contacts with humankind. This paper examined the usages of ‘cheom-seong’ in the Chinese literature dated before the publication of 󰡔Samguk Yusa󰡕, a late 13th century Korean Buddhist historical book that contains the oldest record about the structure among all extant historial texts. I found the oldest usage of cheom-seong(瞻星臺) at 󰡔Ekottara Āgama󰡕, a Buddhist script translated into the Chinese in the late 4th century, and surprised to know that its meaning is ‘looking up the brightness left by Śakra’. I also found that ‘cheom-seong’ had been performed in various religious context, such as Hinduism, Confucianism, Buddhist, Christianism, and Taoism. In Buddhism, there were good, bad, neutral cheom-seong. A good cheom-seong is to look up the heaven for practicing asceticism, reading the heavenly god’s intentions, and achieving one mindedness of Buddhism. A bad cheom-seong includes all astrological fortune-telling activities performed outside the boundaries of Buddhism. A neutral cheom-seong is a secular one. It may help people to understand the nature of the physical world, but was considered to have little meaning unless it relates to the spiritual world of Buddhism. Cheom-seong had been performed repetitively in the processes of constructing Buddhist temples in China. According to the Buddhist scripts, Queen Māyā of Sakya, the birth mother of Gautama Buddha, died seven days after the birth of Buddha, and reborn in the Trāyastriṃśa heaven. Buddha, before his nirvana, ascended from Jetavana to Trāyastriṃśa and spent three months together with his mother. Gautama Buddha then returned to the human world stepping on the stairs built by Viśvakarman, the deity of the creative power in Trāyastriṃśa. King Asoka of later years built a stupa at a site where Buddha descended. Since then, people believed the stairway to the heavens appears at a Buddhist stupa. Carefully examining the paragraphic structure of 󰡔Samguk Yusa󰡕’s records on Cheomseongdae, the fact that the alignment between the tomb of Queen Seondeok and Cheomseongdae is perfectly matching with the sunrise direction at the winter solstice, and other historical records, this paper found that Chemseongdae built in the early years of Queen SeonDeok’s reign(632~647) was a gateway to the Trāyastriṃśa heaven just like the stupa at the Daci Temple(慈恩寺) in China built in 654. The meaning of ‘Cheom-seong-dae’ was turned out to be ‘adoring Trāyastriṃśa stupa’, not ‘gazing star platform.’"

The introduction of the paper briefly describes the life of Padma dBang–rGyal, the author of the root text, and introduces the main commentary and the author of the commentary, Lochen Dharmashri and the second Dudjom Rinpoche. The essence of secret mantra vows is to clean the subtle tendencies and the deluded constructions of the three doors with the non-conceptual wisdom which is the combination of the method and the wisdom. Receiving mantra vows is carried out through the empowerment. The items of the mantra vows are divided into categories of kriyā-tantra, caryā-tantra, yoga-tantra and the highest yoga-tantra. The vows of kriyā-tantra and caryā-tantra is similar to that of the Bodhisattva vows. In the case of the vows of the highest yoga tantra according to Kālacakra tantra, some items which are restricted by the lower vows are permitted. These are permitted in a limited way as a ‘method,’ The items of the secret mantra vows must be understood not on the literal basis but on the basis of the system of the provisional and the ultimate meanings. Finally, How to practice three vows in an individual’s mind stream is discussed. Three vows are consistent with the goal of removing impurity from an individual’s mind stream. There are obvious differences in the three vows, which stem from the disposition and the level of practitioners at each stage."

The results of analyzing the data of 267 professional soldiers by conducting online and offline surveys May-October 2019 are as follow.First, the respondents were poorly prepared for future difficulties and were less likely to be planning for the future, were not using a system that could protect households from financial risks, and had insufficient knowledge of emergency funds. They perceived themselves as practicing insufficient use of household account books, failing to properly save for retirement, and engaging in insufficient insurance management, a long-term financial product.Second, their experience in financial education was 24.3% of internal military education and 25.1% of external military education. The intention to participate in financial education in the future was higher in internal financial education.Third, the group above the average for retirement preparation had higher life attitudes and financial behavior than the group below the average, but there was no difference in the level of financial education experience and financial knowledge depending on retirement preparation.Fourth, the respondents with internal and external financial education experience showed higher levels of financial behavior than those without financial education experience.Fifth, as a result of the logistic regression analysis to assess the influence on retirement preparation, it was found that life attitude and financial behavior had significant effects on the retirement preparation.This study revealed that professional military households are experiencing difficulties with income management and asset formation, and that the demand for financial education inside the military is high. This study provided basic data and implications for financial education for the military."

This commentary has since become, both in name and reality, the representative commentary on the thoughts contained in the voluminous Huayanjing. Also this commentary became important in the Liao that numerous copies were printed over two rounds at the Hongfa si temple 弘法寺 in the Yanjing region 燕京. The commentaries are on the Huayanjing shu (vols 1–4), Suishuyanyi chao (vols. 1–16)(Xuantan 玄談 vol.8). There are three commentaries on the Huayanjing shu chao, composed by Liao scholar-monks, and among these, one is extant in complete form, the juezĕ ji.The posthumous epithet given to Xianyan that was bestowed on him is fitting given the position that he holds in the history of Liao and Huayan Buddhism. In the study not only of the Liao’s Huayan thought, but also East Asian Huayan thought of the medieval period, several aspects of the philological values of the Juezĕ ji are apparent. The current Juezĕ ji is possibly the only literature that allows an investigation of how the expansion of the Huayan school during the Liao period occurred. The many literatures cited within the Juezĕ ji, by counting and comparing the number of times that certain literatures were cited we can ascertain the composition of the Huayan thought that was current during the Liao period and identify those doctrines that were incorporated. Among the literature cited in the Juezĕ ji, it can be noted that Fazang’s representative compositions and Zongmi’s 宗密(780–841) were often cited. In this way, Fazang and Zongmi allows for a connection from the Liao to the Tang period Buddhism, and more specifically, Tang Huayan thought which can be verified through the citations in the Juezĕ ji.The extant segments of the Juezĕ ji are four copies, the first is Kōsanji copy高山寺本 that considered the most preferred source material, the second is Kanazawa copy金澤寫本, the third is Zōkeishoin copy藏經書院本 that a modern transcribed copy of the Kōsanji copy, the forth is Wanxuzang copy卍續藏本 that a printed copy of the Zōkeishoin copy. This means that the Wanxuzang, Zōkeishoin, and the Kōsanji copies are the same versions. In the precedent studies, I procured and analyzed as paragraphs of 122 to 380 point between the manuscripts of Kanajawa copy and the texts of the Wanxuzang copy (from the second to the sixth volume). And now I also make a comparative study until the second to the sixth volume to add the another typical text, the Zōkyoshoin copy. As a result, it has been added and replaced to modify between the texts of the Wanxuzang copy and the Zōkyoshoin copy that have ranged from scores every single fascicle. In this paper I set them all down in a list and referred to the overall points and the one significant abnormality. Thus I sought to introduce the results of comparative studies for the intertextuality of the firth volume to the sixth volume. Consequentially I could reveal the values of intertextuality of the typical three text of Tǎnxuan Juezĕ Ji."

Buddhism begins with saddhā(信) which means trust, and ends with wisdom which means paññā(般若). Saddhā is necessary for vimutti(解脫) in early Buddhism. In Generally in Buddism, ""belief"" is saddhā. In this paper we aim to distinguish saddhā to clarify its precise meaning between amūlikā saddhā and ākāravati saddhā. According to Caṅkīsutta, amūlikā saddhā means a blind belief without criticism. By Vīmaṃsakasutta, ākāravati saddhā means a reasonable belief that admits the quest. Ākāravati saddhā is regarded as intellectual criticism work. ‘Bhatti’ is a religious belief that recognizes transcendental existence. Bhatti is due to fear, iti emphasizs absolute belief. It is distinguished from ākāravati saddhā and bhatti.In the previous study, based on Kesaputtiyasutta, Buddhism has been regarded as a teaching that emphasized freedom of thought rather than trust. But believing in the existence and words of Buddha is the premise of saddhā. Ākāravati saddhā, a belief emphasized in early Buddhism, is closely related to freedom of thought and theory of the knowledge. In order to understand correctly saddhā in Buddhism, it is necessary to accompany free exploration and criticism of the object of faith, the possibility of refusal, the possibility of falsification in Kesaputtiyasutta, Vīmaṃsakasutta. Most of the discussions this saddhā are discussed in relation to ñāṇa in Pāli-Nikāya.Buddha refuses blind beliefs without verification and extravagant belief by the authority of the teacher and emphasizes ākāravati saddhā that arises after his intellectual criticism work. In early Buddhism we refuse amūlikā saddhā which we just believe without quest. We take ākāravati saddhā which is a belief in a rational character. Ākāravati saddhā is a belief justified by quest. Through such ākāravati saddhā with ñāṇa, it leads to vimutti, the ultimate goal of Buddhism."

Three types of animation using walk-through camera were made by Relux program. We measured EEG signals and evaluated physiological responses (perceived safety) by prefrontal alpha asymmetry. The results and conclusion of this study are as follows. Participants showed lower perceived safety in 2000K, while they showed higher perceived safety in 4000K. The stable group whose the left prefrontal area was activated increased perceived safety in order of 2000K, 4000K, and 6000K, which means a higher color temperature leads to a more positive perceived safety. The anxiety group whose the right prefrontal lobe was activated showed higher level of perceived safety in 4000K, however, they showed lower perceived safety in 2000K than in eyes-closed state."
Lazy Learning for Nonparametric Locally Weighted Regression,2020,"['k-nearest neighbors', 'Locally weighted regression', 'Weighted least square estimation', 'Lazy learning', 'Fuzzy C-means clustering']",,"In this study, a newly designed local model called locally weighted regression model is proposed for the regression problem. This model predicts the output for a newly submitted data point. In general, the local regression model focuses on an area of the input space specified by a certain kernel function (Gaussian function, in particular). The local area is defined as a region enclosed by a neighborhood of the given query point. The weights assigned to the local area are determined by the related entries of the partition matrix originating from the fuzzy C-means method. The local regression model related to the local area is constructed using a weighted estimation technique. The model exploits the concept of the nearest neighbor, and constructs the weighted least square estimation once a new query is provided given. We validate the modeling ability of the overall model based on several numeric experiments."

Therefore, this study was aimed to suggest management types for PM<sub>10</sub> in ambient air by clustering 69 cities based on the trends and current levels of PM<sub>10</sub>. In addition, we proposed complementary measures such as the green infrastructure, ventilation corridors and adaptation measures (limit of exposure) for type III (distribution in the central inner region) and IV (metropolitan city, south-east coast region) where improvement of PM<sub>10</sub> was insufficient.

Fused clustering mean estimation of central subspace,2020,['Clustering mean method · Fused estimation · Informative predictor subspace · K-means clustering · Sufficient dimension reduction'],,"Recently, Yoo (Statistics 50:1086–1099, 2016) newly defines an informative predictor subspace to contain the central subspace. The method to estimate the informative predictor subspace does not require any of the conditions assumed to hold in usual sufficient dimension reductionmethodologies.However, like sliced inverse regression (Li in J Am Stat Assoc 86:316–342, 1991) and sliced average variance estimation (Cook and Weisberg in J Am Stat Assoc 86:328–332, 1991), its non-asymptotic behavior in the estimation is sensitive to the choices of the categorization of the predictors and response. The paper develops an estimation approach that is robust to the categorization choices. For this, sample kernel matrices are combined in two ways. Numerical studies and real data analysis are presented to confirm the potential usefulness of the proposed approach in practice."

IA는기업보험(non-consumer insurance)에 있어서 위험정보에 관한 고지의무(the duty of disclosure)에 대해 규정하고 있다. 본 논문은 고지의무의 요건 및 효과를 개관하고, 특히 보험계약자 및 보험자의 주관적 요건에 초점을 두고 살펴보고자 한다. 여기서 주관적 요건은 보험계약자 및 보험자의 인식(knowledge)의문제로서 고지의무의 범위를 정하는 중요한 요소이다. 이는 보험계약자와 보험자의 이해관계를 조정하여 균형 있게 정해져야 할 사항이다. 우리나라에서 고지의무(상법 651조)의 주관적 요건에 대한 심층적 연구는 아직 충분하지 않은 단계이다. IA가 규정하는 고지의무의 주관적 요건에 대한 연구를 통해서 해석론및 입법론에 관련된 시사점을 얻을 수 있다. IA에 따른 고지의무의 주관적 요건의 구체적 내용과 우리 법에 대한 시사점은 다음과 같다.먼저, 보험계약자의 주관적 요건을 본다. 첫째, IA는 보험계약자의 주관적 요건을 보다 구체적으로 규정하여 법적 불확실성을 제거한 측면이 있다. IA는 보험계약자가 아는 것이 구체적으로 누가 아는 것을 의미하는지에 대해 규정하고있다. 이는 우리 상법의 해석에 고려할 수 있다. 특히 보험계약자가 개인이 아닌 단체인 경우에 그러한 규정은 참고의 필요성이 크다. 또한 이는 향후 우리상법의 개정 시에 반영을 고려해볼 사항이다. 둘째, 보험계약자의 주관적 요건을 축소하거나 확대한 측면도 있다. 이 중에서 주관적 요건의 확대는 합리적 검색의 요건을 도입한 것을 가리키는데, 이에 의해서 보험계약자가 알아야 하는사항의 범위가 확대되었고 보험계약자의 부담이 커졌다고 보는 것이 중론이다.합리적 검색의 요건은 우리 상법 651조의 해석에는 고려하기 어렵고, 향후 우리상법의 개정 시에 이를 도입하는 데에도 신중을 기할 필요가 있다.다음, 보험자의 주관적 요건을 보면, 이는 기본적으로 기존에 비해 크게 달라지지 않았다. 보험계약자의 주관적 요건이 크게 확대된 것과 비교할 때 보험자의 주관적 요건의 확대는 상대적으로 경미하여 결과적으로 양자의 균형이 깨진측면이 있다. IA는 보험자의 주관적 요건을 보험자가 아는 것, 보험자가 알아야하는 것, 보험자가 안다고 간주되는 것으로 구분하여 상세히 규정하고 있다. 상당한 변화는 IA 5조 2항⒝가 보험자가 보유한 정보로서 용이하게 이용가능한정보라면 이를 보험자가 알아야 하는 사항에 포함시킨 점이다. IA 5조 2항⒝는우리 상법 651조에 따른 보험자의 고의 또는 중과실을 해석하는 데에 고려할수 있고, 향후 우리 상법의 개정 시에 반영을 고려해볼 사항이다.","The U.K. enacted the Insurance Act (hereafter ʻIAʼ) in 2015. IA prescribes the insuredˈs duty of disclosure regarding risks in the area of non-consumer insurance. This article particularly focuses on how the knowledge of the insured and the insurer act as subjective requirements for the duty of disclosure. As these requirements are significant factors limiting the scope of the duty of disclosure, it is important to strike a fair balance between the interests of the insured and the insurer. Research has rarely been made on the subjective requirements for the duty of disclosure in the Korean Commercial Code Sec. 651. This study of IA may draw meaningful implications for the interpretation and reform of the Korean Commercial Code Sec. 651.The knowledge of the insured has two interesting aspects. First, IA reduces legal uncertainties by defining the insuredˈs knowledge in more detail. IA stipulates whose knowledge is to be understood as the insuredˈs knowledge especially when the insured is not an individual. This rule may be worth consulting in interpreting and reforming the Korean Commercial Code Sec. 651. Second, IA either narrows down or broadens the scope of the insuredˈs knowledge. The latter indicates the introduction of reasonable search. This means that the insured ought to know what should reasonably have been revealed by a reasonable search of information available to the insured. It is widely recognized that the requirement of reasonable search places a heavy burden on the insured as it expands the range of information for disclosure. The requirement of reasonable search is difficult to refer to in interpreting the Korean Commercial Code sec. 651 which forbids the insured’s fraudulent or grossly negligent disclosure. It would also be doubtful at this stage to introduce the concept of reasonable search into the Korean Commercial Code Regarding the insurerˈs knowledge, there have been no significant changes. IA stipulates in detail about the insurerˈs knowledge dividing it into what the insure knows, what the insurer ought to know, and what the insurer is presumed to know.

The purpose of it is, ironically, away from saṁsāra. That is  nirvāṇa, mokṣa. But the best is in this present life to be directly a ‘Arhat’ or ‘jīvanmukti’, not to get away from further transmigration of souls. In this sense, vipassanā disciplinant, Mogok's teaching about nirvāṇa and saṁsāra in ‘present’' is meaningful.Based on  understanding of  ‘12 paṭiccasamuppāda(conditioned co-production)’, he said one life cycle in every moment of life, as well as common meaning of it. He said  depending on processing vedanā(sense), nirvana and cycle is divided. To recognize that anicca(evanescent) of vedanā(sensation) arising by phassa(mental contect), that moment is the nirvana. But if not, it go to cycle of ‘phassa→ vedanā→ taṇhā(craving)→ upādān(clinging)→ bhava(it means generating of kamma, new saṅkhāra)’, and repeat 'viññāņa․nāma rūpa․saḷāyatana․phassa․taṇhā' again. Basically, cattāro satipaṭṭhānā of vipassanā is ascetic exercises recognizing anicca in kāya(body)․vedanā(feelings)․citta(consciousness or mind)․dhamma(mental contents), as a result, realizing its dukha and anattan, and bodynirvana.

All these papers were transcribed to build a corpus and morphemic analysis was conducted using Mecab in the Python package KoNLPy. The corpus was further refined by excluding “unnecessary words” that did not affect composition of the meaning of the text.Word2Vec analysis was conducted on the refined corpus, since it is based on the distribution hypothesis which can demonstrate the relationship between words well. The top 132 words with high cosine similarity to “inquiry” were extracted from the word vector constructed through Word2Vec, and clustering was conducted to capture words more relevant to grammar inquiry. Subsequently, from a total of six clusters, one cluster presumed to be the most relevant to grammar inquiry was finally selected and a qualitative interpretation of the selected cluster was organized. Words such as thinking, divergence, high dimensional, etc. are primarily related to grammar inquiry, and should be noted in future grammar inquiry discussions."

Genome-wide insights of Ethiopian indigenous sheep populations reveal the population structure related to tail morphology and phylogeography,2020,['Fat-tail\xa0· Genetic diversity\xa0· Ovine 50\xa0K SNP\xa0· Population structure'],,"Background Ethiopian sheep living in diferent climatic zones and having contrasting morphologies are a most promising subject of molecular-genetic research. Elucidating their genetic diversity and genetic structure is critical for designing appropriate breeding and conservation strategies. Objective The study was aimed to investigate genome-wide genetic diversity and population structure of eight Ethiopian sheep populations. Methods A total of 115 blood samples were collected from four Ethiopian sheep populations that include Washera, Farta and Wollo (short fat-tailed) and Horro (long fat-tailed). DNA was extracted using Quick-DNA™ Miniprep plus kit. All DNA samples were genotyped using Ovine 50 K SNP BeadChip. To infer genetic relationships of Ethiopian sheep at national, continental and global levels, genotype data on four Ethiopian sheep (Adilo, Arsi-Bale, Menz and Black Head Somali) and sheep from east, north, and south Africa, Middle East and Asia were included in the study as reference. Results Mean genetic diversity of Ethiopian sheep populations ranged from 0.352±0.14 for Horro to 0.379±0.14 for ArsiBale sheep. Population structure and principal component analyses of the eight Ethiopian indigenous sheep revealed four distinct genetic cluster groups according to their tail phenotype and geographical distribution. The short fat-tailed sheep did not represent one genetic cluster group. Ethiopian fat-rump sheep share a common genetic background with the Kenyan fat-tailed sheep. Conclusion The results of the present study revealed the principal component and population structure follows a clear pattern of tail morphology and phylogeography. There is clear signature of admixture among the study Ethiopian sheep populations"

After returning to Silla from Tang, Ch’oe compiled his writings into various anthologies and collections of poems. Some of these collected works were recorded in Xin Tang Shu. The fact that the work of Ch’oe, a foreigner from Silla, was recorded in the Tang dynasty’s history book meant that Ch’oe’s literary ability and the quality of his collected works were very highly regarded. While studying and holding an official position in Tang, Ch’oe socialized with exceptional poets, who spoke highly of Ch’oe in their works. Among Tang poets, Du Sunhe, Luo Yin, Gu Yin, Gao Pian, and Zhang Qiao particularly highly valued Ch’oe’s literary ability. The Korean records show that Ch’oe primarily gained his fame in Tang with the publication of Kyǒk Hwang So sǒ. This fact was first found out by Yi Kyubo. Yi recorded that Ch’oe had shivered Hwang So with Kyǒk Hwang So sǒ. Since then, Kyǒk Hwang So sǒ has become a work that symbolizes the high literary fame and status of Ch’oe. Kyewǒn p’ilgyǒngjip also played an important role in qualifying Ch’oe as Tongguk Munjong.

In the present work, U50 is determined from both measured C50 and SNR values during 15 actual lectures in 11 university classrooms in Korea. The linear regression results for speech transmission index (STI) and U50 values show that classrooms having U50 values greater than +4.1 ㏈ correspond to STI values of 0.60, indicating ‘Good’ acoustical conditions for speech intelligibility. The U50 value is 0.9 ㏈ lower than that of the previous study made in quietly occupied classrooms without student activities. The present result indicates that the noise level is not the same as experienced during actual lecturing situations in university classrooms.

First, the proposed method periodically mines data about how user likes for heating (winter)/cooling (summer) his or her home by learning his or her usage pattern of setting temperature set-point of the thermostat during the past several weeks. Then, from this learning, the proposed method establishes a weekly schedule about temperature setting. Next, by referring to thermal comfort chart by ASHRAE, it makes rules about how to adjust temperature set-points as much as low (winter) or high (summer) while the newly adjusted temperature set-point satisfies thermal comfort zone for predicted humidity.

Korean version of modernism calling scale and surveys were distributed to 295 self-employed business people. Results of confirmatory factor analysis showed that one-factor structure was the most suitable model. In order to test convergent validity, internal motivation and existing calling scales such as CVQ-K, and MCM-K were used and external motivation was also used to confirm discriminant validity. In addition, meaning in life, and life satisfaction were utilized to investigate incremental validity. Results of convergent and discriminant validity tests, Dobrow and Tosti-Kharas’ Calling scale showed significant correlation with existing calling scales and internal value (pleasure and challenge) but it did not show significant relationship with extrinsic motivation-reward and show significant but weak positive relationship with extrinsic motivation-outside. Results of incremental validity test, it significantly predicted both variables, including meaning in life, and life satisfaction after controlling for demographic variables and existing calling scales such as CVQ-K and MCM-K. Lastly, by using cluster analysis, we found that individuals’ religion levels can play an important role in distinguishing neo-classical calling and modernism calling. Such results imply that Korean version of modernism calling scale which consisted of one-factor is valid tool for studying calling-related research within Korean society and understanding multifaceted features of calling. The implication, and limitation of this research were discussed as well as directions for future research."

However, studies that have diversified and analyzed the optimal equipment assignments for responding to oil spill accidents have not been preceded. In response to the need for analyzing optimal equipment assignments study, we devised a genetic algorithm for optimal equipment assignments. The designed genetic algorithm yielded 10,000 optimal equipment assignments. We clustered using the k -means algorithm. As a result, the two clusters of Yeosu, Daesan, and Ulsan, which are expected to be the largest spills, were clearly identified. We also projected 16-dimensional data in two dimensions via Sammon’s mapping. The projected data were analyzed for distribution. We confirmed that results of the simulation were better than those of optimal equipment assignments included in the cluster.In the future, it will be possible to implement an approximate model with excellent performance based on this study."

Mainland China is a complex distribution of languages belonging to various language families, such as the Sino-Tibetan languages, Kra-Dai languages, Austronesian languages, Austroasiatic languages, and Altaic languages. Since they have strong linguistic contacts over a long period of time, the study of language typology in mainland China has a very important meaning not only for the study of Chinese but also for the study of world language typology.  First of all, this paper compares and analyzes the classification of Chinese dialect area in the preceding studies to reconsider the criteria and methods for classifying language typology in Chinese dialect area, and discusses the need for subdividing Mandarin dialects and adding other ethnic languages. In addition, by creating a language altas of typology about the plosive coda of the Sinitic dialect and ethnic minority languages, we observe the areal typology of the plosive coda of Sinitic dialects and ethnic minority languages distributed in mainland China from a macro perspective. In addition, in connection with ethnic minority languages distributed in the central and southern regions of China and its neighboring regions, it attempts to analyze the regional type of the plosive coda of the Chinese central and southern regions from a regional typological angle. By observing and analyzing the type of areal distribution of the plosive coda in the same region together based on the plosive coda ‘-p, -t, -k’ and the areal distribution of the plosive coda in the ethnic minority languages, the close language contact and language shift phenomena of the Sinitic languages and ethnic languages are discussed."

The controversies on the Lecturers Act, a typical example of wicked problem which had been suspended for seven years due to its own complexities and controversies, is analyzed through its agenda-setting, public decision making, suspension and implementation. Emphasis shall be put on the causes and goals of the Act, participation of the stake-holders, their diverse positions, etc. Although the legislation since 2011 clearly stated that its purpose is to improve the status and rewards for part-time university instructors, it does not appear that the overall process have fared well. The key issues include: unclear formation of the issues, mimatch of policy goals-means, lack of efficient communication with target groups/participants, etc. There seems to be no cure-all for this wicked problem. We suggest that, based on complete awareness and knowledge of the issues in question, there should be more efforts in enlarging networked, collaborative approach instead of a hasty, top-down one when addressing this nature of tough issues."
현대 여성시에 나타난 식인(食人)의 윤리와 정치,2020,"['여성시', '음식', '면(麵)', '차이', '지각불가능하게-되기(생성)', '탈주선', '윤리', '정치', 'Female Poems', 'Food', 'Noodle', 'Difference', 'Becoming-Imperceptible (Creation)', 'Line of Flight', 'Ethics', 'Politics']",,"In this study, ethics and politics of cannibalism presented in modern female poems were examined by relating to noodles. To examine how the noodles are implicated in poems and the meaning that poets try to say through eating behaviors, Bourdieu and Deleuze’s discussions were referenced. Bourdieu said food is a mechanism that creates and recreates the sexism and Deleuze suggested rhizome or becoming- that would reinforce physical literacy to get out of this dominant system. Rhizome is a method of dissolving hierarchical aggregate and drawing the line of flight of molecular creation, and it is presented in female poems by relating to the noodles.In some female poems, food is materialized into jjajangmyeon (black bean sauce noodles), fried noodles, kalguksu (knife-cut noodles) and noodles, and eating the food is performed when consciousness is broken. Therefore, it may result in failure (CHOI, J.R), meeting strangers (HEO, S.K), arriving at an ambiguous state (JEONG, G.B), or result in spilling the food (LEE, G.H). During the process, a landscape of strange road-noodle is unfolded where bodies are mixed with past and present, myth and mundane world, and life and death, where ego is mixed with others, and where countless others are co-existed. Poets try to commune with others in that boundary. At this moment, road-noodle functions as a type of the line of flight to run away from the oppressive reality, and refuses colonization of malesㆍcapital while simultaneously shows poets’ ethical spirit of resistance who seek to share and communicate.On the other hand, an opposition between eating and being eaten sometimes releases destructive energy in poems. Preference of food that is materialized into ramen, noodle strips, spaghetti is mixed with other different series to function to shake the split line of binary opposition violently. That is the branch where history and civilization meet (SHIN, H.J), chunk of dough (KIM, S.W), red motorway (KIM H.S), face of others (LEE W). Eating by these cannibalistic subjects is different from eating by masculine subjects that make others to return to the coordinate of identity, it stays in a gap between ego and others, showing a movement that opposes subjectivation. As this movement is a poetic energy that creates new body and birth of sense, it shows political esthetics that females, as a minority who causes a rift in the senses of group, write poems.In female poems, the noodles response to the capital, nation, reason, and logic of rationality that capture individual lives into a fixed circuit while simultaneously function as a type of the line of flight to escape from hierarchical authority. It has significances in that it shows an opportunity of birth of new life after getting out of the major and dominant flow while simultaneously looks back the eating-being eaten method that preserves lives."

Initially, 71 statements were extracted from the interviews, and then categorized into 6 clusters using by multi-dimensional scaling analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis. As a result, a conceptual diagram of 6 clusters according to two dimensions were derived. Those six clusters were ‘individual meaning of diet’, ‘various emotions experienced during diet’, ‘diet that is conscious of others’, ‘diet methods related to exercise and muscle’, ‘diet methods controlled by food’, ‘personal motivation and goal for diet’. In addition, the two dimensions that classify the 6 clusters are the ‘cognitive factor – emotional factor’ and ‘motivational aspect – method aspect’ respectively.

『법법성분별론』 전의(轉依) 개념의 특징,2020,"['Dharmadharmatāvibhaṅga', 'āśraya-parivṛtti', 'āśraya', 'tathatā', 'Vasubandhu.', '『법법성분별론』', '전의', '소의', '진여', '세친']","법과 법성을 주제로 한 『법법성분별론』에서는 법의 특징을 비존재가 현현하는 허망분별로 정의하고, 법성의 특징은 그것이 사라진 진여의 현현으로정의한다. 이때 세친은 법성에 대하여 ‘전의에 의해 특징 지워진다’는 설명을 덧붙이고 있다. 전의의 결과, 있는 그대로의 진여가 성취되기 때문일 것이다.전의를 문자 그대로 ‘소의의 전환’으로 이해할 때, 소의란 정작 무엇을 의미하는가. 『법법성분별론』에서 제시되는 법의 소의는 수행자의 몸과 마음혹은 인격적 개체의 의미를 넘어서, 외부세계인 기세간까지 포함하고 있다.위 없는 법성의 증득을 설명하면서, 법성의 소의는 일체법과 12분교의 일체경장으로 제시된다. 일체경장에 대한 올바른 작의에 의하여 붓다의 교법을의지처로 삼을 때, 청정한 소의의 전환은 성취될 것이다.이러한 전의는 견도에서 처음 획득되고, 수도를 거쳐 구경도에서 마침내완전하게 성취된다. 전의의 단계를 이와 같이 설명하는 방식은 『대승장엄경론』과의 많은 유사성을 보여준다. 구경의 단계에서 획득된 진여의 상태를다시 유구진여와 무구진여로 나누어 설명하는 방식에서는 『보성론』과의 친연성을 확인할 수 있다. 특히 허공의 비유를 해석하는 세친의 입장은 ‘전의에 있어서 실제로 변화한 것은 없다’는 여래장의 해석과도 맞닿아 있다. 전의는 마음을 덮는 우연적인 번뇌가 제거된 것일 뿐, 마음의 본성은 본래 밝게 빛나는 것이어서, 아무 것도 변한 것은 없기 때문이다.","In the Dharmadharmatāvibhaṅga, the characteristic of the dharma is defined as the untrue discrimination manifested by the non-existent. And the characteristic of the dharmatā is defined as the manifestation of tathatā, which means the state where the untrue discrimination has disappeared. At this time, Vasubandhu explains that the dharmatā is characterized by the concept of parāvṛtti (or parivṛtti).Taking the expression 'transformation of āśraya' literally, what is the meaning of the āśraya? In this text, the āśraya of the dharma goes beyond the meaning of the body, mind, and personality of the practitioner. It also includes the external environment of the world. The āśraya of dharmatā is explained as with the sarvadharma and the all sūtra piṭaka. This transformation transmutation is firstly acquired on the darśana-mārga, and finally fully accomplished through the bhāvanā-mārga. On this point, it has a similarity with the Mahāyānasūtrālaṃkāra.We can also confirm the affinity with the Ratnagotravibhāga, on the point of dividing tathatā into samala and nirmala. The position of Vasubandhu, interpreting the metaphor of the ākāśa, is also in line with the tathāgatagarbha, which suggests there is no real change in the āśraya-parivṛtti. The reason is that the accidental defilement has been removed, and the nature of the mind shines originally brightly."

For data collection, 60 seniors of K junior college participated in a flipped learning English class for one semester. The control group was taught by the traditional lecture-based method and the experimental group was taught through the method of flipped learning. A pre-vocabulary test, a post-vocabulary test, and a delayed-vocabulary test were conducted to measure students’ vocabulary knowledge in terms of Nation’s (2013) three dimensions; form, meaning, and use. Then, the students were given a survey questionnaire with open-ended questions. The findings show that there was a significant difference between the vocabulary tests, indicating positive effects of flipped learning classes on vocabulary learning. Flipped learning was more effective to help students learn and memorize the form and meaning of vocabulary than use. The survey results show that students were satisfied with the flipped learning class due to the online visual materials and the collaborative activities in class despite the learners’ burden of having to watch the preview video regularly."

This correlational study was conducted among 75 middle-aged cancer patients with cancer living in the S and K regions in Korea. For data collection, a structured questionnaire was used for subjects who agreed to the study. The study tool measured breast cancer adaptation, family support, and self-efficacy and the collected data were analyzed using the SPSS / WIN 23.0 program. The general characteristics and degree of cancer adaptation, family support, and self-efficacy were analyzed using frequency and percentage, mean, and standard deviation, and the Pearson's coefficient was used for correlation between cancer adaptation, family support, and self-efficacy. The results showed that middle-aged breast cancer patients’ cancer adaptation score was 77.03 (± 6.79). The family support score was 14.56 (± 13.28), and the self-efficacy was 40.15 (± 12.26). The results show that, as family support and self-efficacy increased, the breast cancer adaptation result increased. Therefore, we suggest collecting basic data for the development of programs that can enhance cancer adaptation for middle-aged breast cancer patient."

Thus, comparing and examining this concept with the representative works of the two traditions, Mūlamadhyamaka-kārikā (MMK) and Brahma-sūtra-bhāṣya (BSB), will be useful for a better understanding of the methodology of Liberation, or the logic of Liberation, that penetrate each ontology and performance theory.First of all, while prapañca maintains its etymological meaning ‘to make clear by spreading or stretching, to say in detail, to cheat or distort’, it refers to in MMK all the linguistic and conceptual processes that mean ‘linguistic proliferation’, and in BSB the phenomenal world or the world of extension. Prapañca also has philosophical connotations such as ‘① spreading or proliferation, ② illusion or delusion, ③ obstruction’ in each system. From this, it is understood that prapañca is secondary, pointing to what is proliferated and what is delusional and what is obstructive in the primary ‘something’. In MMK, if the primary thing is phenomena of dependent origination, the secondary prapañca is the world of language that operates around conceptualization. In BSB, if the primary thing is Pure Consciousness or Ātman, the secondary prapañca is a psychological and physical world that works around epistemological ignorance. Even though the secondary prapañca creates a situation of bondage by distorting or concealing the primary prapañca, in a perspective that a return to the primary can be achieved only through that secondary, MMK and BSB have no choice but to use the ‘methodology of negation’. The way to deny or annihilate the secondary, that is a sort of deception or falsehood, is to break away from the ‘hypostatization’ of language in the case of Buddhism and, in the case of Vedānta, break away from the ‘objectification’ of ignorance. Through self-awareness of emptiness in the case of Buddhism and through the generation of knowledge in the case of Vedānta, if the secondary prapañca is negated or annihilated respectively, it is finally possible to recover the primary prapañca or liberation."

Since conferring such an obligation on a party against the other party who has not yet engaged in a pre-existent legal relationship with the named debtor means acknowledging a kind of third party effect to the other party’s obligatory right to the third party, the related Supreme Court decisions have to be analysed to either back up or criticize. The purpose of this paper is to ascertain whether the obligation to register in the unmovable property registry is to be characterized as a duty by the debtor to reverse unjust en richment, i f the debtor w ho k eeps i n valid registration hampers t he r ealization of the creditor’s obligatory right against the third party without any legal justification and the obligation is the only way to rescue the creditor’s hampered obligatory right.This research was triggered by the controversial Supreme Court decision dated on 9th March 2017, 2015DA21798 among civil law scholars. But this paper reveals there have been many other Supreme Court decisions of the same characterization This paper argues that either creditors who have revoked a fraudulent transaction by a debtor or other creditors who can benefit from the revocation and restoration in accordance with Article 407 of Korean Civil Code are eligible to request any third party who keeps invalid registration by virtue of an invalid transaction with the said debtor holding an apparent right caused by revocation and restoration to delete invalid registration in the unmovable property registry to the effect that the restored property shall be subject to seizure by creditors in accordance with Article 407 of Korean Civil Code and that such an obligation by the debtor with invalid registration is to be deemed as a duty to reverse unjust enrichment, otherwise the creditors right which is allocated and guaranteed by that provision cannot be realized. In addition, this paper critically analyzed other Supreme Court decisions, which conferred an obligation to reverse unjust enrichment on a party who has not yet engaged in pre-existent either obligatory or proprietary relationship against the other party who has an obligatory right against a third party, and which cannot be classified as a unjust en richment case.

For this purpose, this article examined the Chinese language notes of the time based on the period of Song(宋), which is reflected in So, Ong(邵雍), and what principles were used to write down the Goryeo language. The actual translated patterns were examined according to the internal order of Gyerimyusa, and the transcription patterns of substantives, predicates, or sentences. As a result, substantives are usually transferred in a single form, which reflects the simplification of the word /h/ or consonant group. In the predicates or sentence, only one word(upper root) is divided into two types: transcription (amplification, command, origin, questioning), three-way transcription, and quadrupole transcription. It is difficult to decipher when transcribed in the same Chinese characters as the heading clause. The Gyerimyusa seems to have more function of indicating meaning than previously pointed out with the characteristic features of Chinese characters. This may result in the selection of the best transcription and the selection of the next best phonograph. Finally, depending on the phonological characteristics of the Chinese language, it can be seen that the consonant and vowel positions are the same or great in the next syllable transcription, as well as the link between the consonant and the vowel."
가로림만 표층 퇴적물 내 미량금속 분포 특성,2020,"['Trace metals', 'Sediments', 'Garolim Bay', 'Enrichment factor', 'Leached fraction']",,"In 2010 and 2015, total 77 surface sediment samples were collected to assess the anthropogenic effects of trace metals in surface sediments of Garolim Bay, and the physical characteristics (particle size and specific surface area) and geochemical components (major (Al, Ca, Fe, K, Ba) and trace metals (Mn, Cs, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb), organic carbon and calcium carbonate) were analyzed. Mean grain size of Garolim Bay surface sediments ranged from 0.51-5.58 Ø (mean 3.98 Ø) and increased from the inlet of bay to the inner bay, and from the waterway to the land. Most of the metal concentrations except for some elements showed the similar distribution to those of mean grain size and specific surface area. As the particle size decreased and the specific surface area increased, the metal concentration increased. In order to estimate the factors controlling the concentration of trace metals, factor analysis was performed, and three factors were extracted (92.7% of the total variation). Factor 1 accounted for 71.3% of the total variation, which was a grain size factor. Factor 2 accounted for 14.2% of the total variation, Factor 3 accounted for 7.2% of the total variance. Enrichment factor was calculated using the particle size corrected background concentration. Metals with a enrichment factor of 1.5 or higher and the number of samples were 4 for Cr (St. 1, 16, 27, 39) and 1 for Pb (St. 39), but there were little differences in the concentrations of 1M HCl leached metals for these metals. The percentage of 1M HCl leached fraction to total metal concentration decreased in the order of Pb~Co>Cu>Zn~Mn>Ni>Cr. Comparing this value with contaminated and clean sediments in other coastal areas, the percentages for each metal were similar regardless of the trace metal levels in all regions. This fact might be resulted from the reaction between the 1M HCl solution and the different sediment constituents, indicating that there is a limit to apply this percentage of leached metal to the estimation of the contamination extent."
Investigating the Au-Cu thick layers Electrodeposition Rate with Pulsed Current by Optimization of the Operation Condition,2020,"['Alloy Electrode position', 'Au-Cu Bath Composition', 'Average Current Density', 'Optimization of Deposition Rate', 'Duty Cycle', 'Formation of Layers and Gold Percentage']",,"The impact of effective parameters on the electrodeposition rate optimization of Au-Cu alloy at high thicknesses on the silver substrate was investigated in the present study. After ensuring the formation of gold alloy deposits with the desired and standard percentage of gold with the cartage of 18K and other standard karats that should be observed in the manufacturing of the gold and jewelry artifacts, comparing the rate of gold-copper deposition by direct and pulsed current was done. The rate of deposition with pulse current was significantly higher than direct current. In this process, the duty cycle parameter was effectively optimized by the ""one factor at a time"" method to achieve maximum deposition rate. Particular parameters in this work were direct and pulse current densities, bath temperature, concentration of gold and cyanide ions in electrolyte, pH, agitation and wetting agent additive. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and surface chemical analysis system (EDS) were used to study the effect of deposition on the cross-sections of the formed layers. The results revealed that the Au-Cu alloy layer formed with concentrations of 6gr·L<sup>-1</sup> Au, 55gr·L<sup>-1</sup> Cu, 24 gr·L<sup>-1</sup> KCN and 1 ml·L<sup>-1</sup> Lauryl dimethyl amine oxide (LDAO) in the 0.6 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup> average current density and 30% duty cycle, had 0.841 ㎛·min<sup>-1</sup> Which was the highest deposition rate. The use of electrodeposition of pure and alloy gold thick layers as a production method can reduce the use of gold metal in the production of hallow gold artifacts, create sophisticated and unique models, and diversify production by maintaining standard karats, hardness, thickness and mechanical strength. This will not only make the process economical, it will also provide significant added value to the gold artifacts. By pulsating of currents and increasing the duty cycle means reducing the pulse off-time, and if the pulse off-time becomes too short, the electric double layer would not have sufficient growth time, and its thickness decreases. These results show the effect of pulsed current on increasing the electrodeposition rate of Au-Cu alloy confirming the previous studies on the effect of pulsed current on increasing the deposition rate of Au-Cu alloy."

"국내 고령자의 Y-DuCog 표준치, 인지기능에 관한 연구",2020,"['cognitive function', 'dual task', 'elderly', 'Y-DuCog']",,"Purpose : This study aimed to present normative data for older Korean adults completing the Yonsei dual task cognitive screening test (Y-DuCog) and identify changes in cognitive function on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment - Korean (MoCA-K) with age.Methods : From May 2019 to August 2019, 195 healthy adults aged ≥60 years participated in this study. All participants completed the Y-DuCog to assess their dual-task performance and the MoCA-K to assess their cognitive function. Participants were divided into three groups based on their age: 60~69 years, 70~79 years, and ≥80 years.Results : The results of the Y-DuCog showed that dual-task performance time, effect, and correct response rate decreased significantly with age (p<.001). Scores from the three groups showed differences on all items (p<.001). Cognitive function on the MoCA-K also decreased significantly with age (mean score ± standard deviation [SD]; 27.33 ± 2.61 in subjects aged 60~69 years; 24.82 ± 3.20 in subjects aged 70~79 years; and 22.10 ± 4.91 in subjects aged ≥80 years; p<.001).Conclusions : Occupational therapists should be aware of the decline in cognitive function and dual-task performance time, effect, and correct response rate in older adults and consider interventions to treat this decline. Further studies are needed with larger groups of participants to examine factors, such as sex and education, that may impact dual-task performance and cognitive function."
Regression Model to Predict Nitrogen Mineralization Using Soil Parameters for Pepper Upland,2020,"['Nitrogen', 'Mineralization model', 'Upland soils']",,"One of the most important practices for nitrogen (N) management in arable lands is to minimize N loss using soil-customized N supply. Despite that N mineralization of soils is an useful parameter to manage N fertilization, it requires a lot of analysis. To predict N mineralization rate of upland soils, we performed regression analysis between N mineralization parameters (Mineralized N, N0, k) and soil properties. Experimental soils were randomly sampled from 40 pepper cultivation fields before fertilization. The rate of soil N mineralization was analyzed through incubation for 16 weeks at 27℃. N mineralization parameters of soils were estimated from first-order kinetic model, and a stepwise regression was conducted to predict the mineralized N, N0 and k using soil properties. Mineralized N was linearly correlated with EC (R²=0.745) which meant a good indicator to predict N mineralization rate. N0 as potentially mineralizable N was positively correlated with soil organic matter (SOM) and total N, and those represented a linear relationship (y=0.0682x, R²=0.729). SOM, sand, clay and C/N ratio were selected as parameters for prediction of N0 (R²=0.448). In addition, a regression equation for estimation of k was composed of EC, CEC, sand and clay (R²=0.508). In conclusion, we suggest that N mineralization rate by combination with soil properties could be determined with a regression equation. However, model equation represented in this study should be validated and improved through field experiments with different levels of N application and different types of soil property."
Effect of water scarcity during thermal-humidity exposure on the mineral footprint of sheep,2020,"['Ewes', 'Minerals', 'Thermal-humidity Exposure', 'Water Scarcity', 'Wool']",,"Objective: Combination of two stressors on alteration of mineral footprints in animals needs due attention to meet maximum production and welfare, particularly in grazing sheep. This study tested whether ewes (Ovis aries) exposed to water deprivation and thermal–humidity stressors had altered mineral footprints in their wool, serum, urine, and feces.Methods: Nine ewes (age = 3 years; mean body weight = 41±3.5 kg) were divided among a control group with free access to water, and treatment groups with water deprivation lasting either 2 h (2hWD) or 3 h (3hWD) after feeding. Using a 3×3 Latin square design, animals were assigned to treatment groups for three sampling periods of 21 days each (n = 9). Blood was collected by jugular venipuncture. Wool was collected at the end of periods 2 and 3. Metabolic crates designed with metal grated floors were used for urine and feces collection. We measured sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), phosphorus (P), chloride (Cl), calcium (Ca), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn).Results: The wool mineral levels did not differ between the treatment groups, although K was marginally lower (p = 0.10) in the 2hWD group. The serum and urine mineral levels did not differ between the treatments (p>0.05). Fecal K was significantly lower in the 2hWD group than in the other groups (p≤0.05).Conclusion: In conclusion, water deprivation and thermal-humidity exposure altered the excretion of K, but not of other minerals, in the wool, urine, feces, or serum of ewes. Thus, no additional mineral supplementation is needed for water deprived ewes during thermal-humidity exposure."

It is necessary to analyze the cultivation environment and evaluate the crop productivity under agrivoltaic because the shading point changes according to structure of agrivoltaic and sun’s position. Two types of “fixing” and “tracing” agrivoltaic were installed, and a rice cultivation experiment was conducted in the fields under each agrivoltaic and without shading (control). “Hyunpoombyeo” was transplanted on June 7, 2019, and grown with fertilization of 9.0-4.5-5.7 kg/10a (N-P-K). Fifteen weather stations were installed under each agrivoltaic to measure solar radiation and temperature, and yield and yield-related elements were investigated by points. The accumulated solar radiation during the rice growing season in fixing was no much difference between points, and that in tracing was much difference between points. However, the average solar radiations of two agrivoltaics were similar. The mean temperature, yield, and yield-related elements showed a significant difference for the shading rate, and decreased with increasing the shading rate except ripening grain rate and 1000 grain weight of fixing agrivoltaic. In the relationship between shading rate and yield, fixing and tracing were fitted to a logistic equation and a simple linear equation, respectively, and showed a high correlation (tracing: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.62, fixing: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.73). The shading rate variation by point for two types was large despite similar yield variation. Thus, it needs to be more closely examined the relationship of the shading rate for a specific period rather than the shading rate during the whole growing season."

To achieve this, 31 smokers without no illness and no psychiatric history were selected (28 males and 3 females); they were aged 20 to 27 years and were physically and mentally healthy students attending K University. Their lung functions were measured, and gene polymorphisms of cytochrome P-450 1A1 (CYP1A1) related to metabolic activation of tobacco components and gene polymorphism of tumor protein 53 (TP53) related to lung cancer were analyzed. As a result, the mean values ​​of lung function of TT and Arg / Arg without genetic mutations were the highest, and ANOVA analysis of CYP1A1 and lung functions showed that the P-value of FVC was 0.049, which was different between groups. In other words, there is no high mutation in Cytochrome P-450 1A1 (CYP1A1) gene, which is associated with the metabolic activation of tobacco components.

Crashworthiness of Thermoplastic Woven Glass Fabric Reinforced Composite Tubes Manufactured by Pultrusion,2020,"['Woven fabric', 'Thermoplastic composite', 'Tubes', 'Pultrusion', 'Crashworthiness']",,"In this paper, crashworthiness of thermoplastic woven fabric reinforced composite tubes were investigated. Thermoplastic composite tubes with various length (40 mm and 80 mm) and fiber yarn orientation with respective tolengthwise (0 o/90 o, 15 o/75 o, 30 o/60 o and 45 o/45 o) were manufactured by pultrusion and welding from home-made woven glass fabric/PP prepreg sheets. Quasi-static axial compressive tests of the composite tubes were performed under various temperatures (298 K, 358 K, 398 K and 453 K). Three crushing modes were observed: progressive folding, splaying and weld seam cracking. The influence of fiber orientation, tube length-diameter ratio and testing temperature on the peak load, mean load, specific energy absorption and crush efficiency were investigated. The results show that the peak load is controlled by fiber orientation and testing temperature. The mean force, specific energy absorption and crush efficiency are related to the three mentioned factors. Both fiber orientation and testing temperature have obviously influence on crushing modes of thermoplastic composite tubes. Length-to-diameter ratio also plays a role in crushing modes when the testing temperature is higher than the melting point of the resin."

The unit of headwords includes both smaller and larger units: from morphemes such as affixes, particles, endings to sentences such as famous quotes, and old sayings. It encompasses all the possible units suitable as an entry of a dictionary. Out of 440K headwords from the Joseonmal Unabridged Dictionary, only the noun has increased its proportion in the ratio of headwords based on lexical categories, compared to its first edition. The North Korea attempted to revise word notations for ‘am- (female), su- (male)’ in ‘Choseonmal Regulations’ (2010). As a normative dictionary, the Joseonmal Unabridged Dictionary also reflected this trend in its headwords, resulting in the different word notations for two Koreas. On the other hand, there were cases where the wording and meaning of words from two Koreas became identical. The macrostructure of Joseonmal Unabridged Dictionary has developed by articulately selecting adverb entries and supplementing the grammatical morpheme lists known as ‘To(토)’. Furthermore, mitigating the degree of restrictions in creating refined words as well as large scale addition of recent and information-related words demonstrate the intention to keep up with the current state of the North Korean language while emphasizing the normality. I hope the analysis from this paper to help fellow researchers to capture the current state in the North Korean language and its dictionary."
Why Do We Overlap Each Other?: Collaborative Overlapping Talk in English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) Communication,2020,"['English as a lingua franca', 'turn-taking', 'overlaps', 'involvement', 'cooperation']",,"Overlap is often considered as a breakdown of the one-at-a-time principle in conversational turn-taking and something to be resolved. However, in English as a lingua franca (ELF) interaction, the speakers are found to endeavour to achieve cooperative and supportive turn-taking and turn-management through a dynamic use of overlapping talk. This study aims to explore how the international students in the U.K university employ the interactional dynamics of overlap as a resource for co-constructing meanings and joint accomplishment of turn-taking by analysing naturally occurring ELF interactions with Conversation Analysis (CA). The findings reveal that the participants produced a high frequency of overlapping talk in interaction, and particularly overlaps occurred when the speakers made a backchannel, echoing response, and utterance completion. A delayed response or turn transition may cause a violation of turn-taking in conversation, and consequently the speakers attempt to provide frequent and timely responses, which may lead to the high frequency of overlaps and simultaneous talk. As a turn-switch between speakers is not completely smooth, and overlapping talk is an inevitable outcome of dynamic and collaborative turn-taking practices, classroom teaching needs to encourage English language learners to use more adaptive pragmatic strategies such as repair, accommodation, or clarification request when overlaps cause communicative problems."

In addition, the score of MoCA-K increased after the intervention compared to before the intervention, and the score of GDS-K decreased, leading to an increase in cognitive function and decrease in depression. Conclusion : Through the board game, a positive change in memory appeared. It was also confirmed that it has an effect on cognitive function and reduction of depression. However, it is difficult to generalize due to the small number of targets, and the method and components of the board game need to be modified. It is hoped that through further study, board games that complement the problems will continue to be developed and contribute to the improvement of cognitive function and quality of life of the elderly."

The average travel duration was in the range of 39 to 91 min in motorbike, 83 to 140 min in car and 110 to 161 min in bus. Though there was variation on exposure to concentration in modes of transportation, the maximum exposure concentration of PM2.5 was observed as 709 μg/m³ in bus and the minimum exposure concentration was 29 μg/m³ in closed car. Similarly, the maximum exposure concentration of NO₂ was observed to be 312 μg/m³ in bus and the minimum exposure concentration was 21 μg/m³ in car. The concentration of elements in PM2.5 was in the order of Si > Na > Ca > Al ≥ K > S ≥ Cd, with Si and Cd concentration as 60% and < 1% of the PM2.5 concentration."
"Prognostic Value of Tumor Regression Grade on MR in Rectal Cancer: A Large-Scale, Single-Center Experience",2020,"['Rectal neoplasm', 'Regression', 'Magnetic resonance imaging', 'Prognosis', 'Survival analysis']",,"Objective: To determine the prognostic value of MRI-based tumor regression grading (mrTRG) in rectal cancer compared with pathological tumor regression grading (pTRG), and to assess the effect of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) on interobserver agreement for evaluating mrTRG.Materials and Methods: Between 2007 and 2016, we retrospectively enrolled 321 patients (male:female = 208:113; mean age, 60.2 years) with rectal cancer who underwent both pre-chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and post-CRT MRI. Two radiologists independently determined mrTRG using a 5-point grading system with and without DWI in a one-month interval. Two pathologists graded pTRG using a 5-point grading system in consensus. Kaplan-Meier estimation and Cox-proportional hazard models were used for survival analysis. Cohen’s kappa analysis was used to determine interobserver agreement.Results: According to mrTRG on MRI with DWI, there were 6 mrTRG 1, 48 mrTRG 2, 109 mrTRG 3, 152 mrTRG 4, and 6 mrTRG 5. By pTRG, there were 7 pTRG 1, 59 pTRG 2, 180 pTRG 3, 73 pTRG 4, and 2 pTRG 5. A 5-year overall survival (OS) was significantly different according to the 5-point grading mrTRG (p = 0.024) and pTRG (p = 0.038). The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was significantly different among the five mrTRG groups (p = 0.039), but not among the five pTRG groups (p = 0.072). OS and DFS were significantly different according to post-CRT MR variables: extramural venous invasion after CRT (hazard ratio = 2.259 for OS, hazard ratio = 5.011 for DFS) and extramesorectal lymph node (hazard ratio = 2.610 for DFS). For mrTRG, k value between the two radiologists was 0.309 (fair agreement) without DWI and slightly improved to 0.376 with DWI.Conclusion: mrTRG may predict OS and DFS comparably or even better compared to pTRG. The addition of DWI on T2-weighted MRI may improve interobserver agreement on mrTRG."

The study of the commentary on the Tae-hyǒn writings is part of the study of Korean Buddhism, and furthermore, it is the process of rebirth of Silla Buddhism or Taehyun. The meaning of literature on shuyosho is summarized in three categories: First, it is a representative text existing among the literatures of completely commentary on the preface of the Chinese monk Taofeng. Second, it is important in the sense that it reflects the critical view of Sen-yu on the existing preface interpretation. Third, while accepting the interpretation tradition of the existing on kyebon-jonygo, Sen-yu had actively represented Tae-hyǒn's position and builded his own ideas. From this point, shuyosho is a very important document in that it can know the trend and development of the annotation about the kyebon-jongyo of Tae-hyǒn. On the other hand, Tae-hyǒn is recognized as the lineage of Wǒnchuk, Xianzhang's most famous disciple. Second, there is a side to deepen Tae-hyǒn's theory while accepting Weonhyo and Fazang's theory. Third, in the difference of each theory such as Ki in China and Uijǒk in Silla, shuyosho is based in Tae-hyǒn's theory. However, it should not be overlooked that it shows the tendency to prioritize the traditional theory of Japan hosso-school rather than Tae-hyǒn's theory."

달서천에 서식하는 나일틸라피아(Oreochromis niloticus) 개체군 특성,2020,"['thermal effluent stream', 'Nile tilapia', 'population characteristic', 'gonadosomatic index']",,"This study was conducted to investigate the population characteristics of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in the Daegu Metropolitan City thermal effluent stream (Dalseo Stream) from January to November 2019. The collected fish were identified as 4,247 individuals of 20 species from a total of eight families. The dominant species was O. niloticus with 1,306 individuals and a high relative abundance (30.75%). The water temperature of Dalseo Stream was maintained above 10℃ throughout the year, which means that O. niloticus could inhabit it even in winter. The length-weight analysis showed a regression coefficient b of 3.1496, and a condition factor (k) of 0.0025 with a positive slope. Comparing the water temperature of Dalseo Stream and the total length of O. niloticus per investigation period, the 0-age individuals appeared May 29 when the water temperature was maintained above 22℃. In conclusion, the thermal effluent of Dalseo Stream allowed O. niloticus to survive in winter and maintain stable growth conditions and life cycles. The results of this study will inform ecological information on O. niloticus, which suggests that river management efforts should consider the management of O. niloticus populations for the conservation of fish species diversity."

Relationship of mineral elements in sheep grazing in the highland agro-ecosystem,2020,"['Macro and Micro Mineral', 'Deficiency', 'Soil-plant-animal', 'Qilian Mountain Grassland', 'Correlations']",,"Objective: Minerals are one of the important nutrients for supporting the growth of sheep grazing in the highland, northwest of China. The experiment was conducted to investigate the relationship of both macro and micro minerals in sheep grazing in the highlands of six districts located in the Qilian Mountain of China. Methods: Samples of herbage (n = 240) and soil (n = 240) were collected at random in a ""W"" shape across the area designated for harvesting from 24 farms, where the sheep commonly graze in October (winter) for mineral analyses. In addition, serum samples were taken via jugular vein from 20 sheep per farm from 24 farms (n = 480 samples in total) for serum minerals analyses. Mean values of macro and micro minerals were statistically compared among districts and the correlations among soil-plant-animal were statistically analyzed and correlations were regressed, as well. Results: The results revealed that there were variations for both macro and micro minerals among districts. Statistical analysis of the correlation coefficients between herbage and sheep were significantly different for most of the minerals but not for P, Cu, and Se. Many correlation regression coefficients were found significantly different among minerals of herbage, soil, and sheep serum especially those of K, Na, Fe, Mn, and Zn (between herbage and sheep serum), and Fe and Mn (between herbage and soil), Na, Fe, Mn, and Zn (between soil and sheep serum), respectively. The regression coefficient equations derived under this experiment for prediction of Ca (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.618), K (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.803), Mg (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.767), Na (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.670), Fe (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.865),Zn (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.950), Mn (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.936), and Se (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.630), resulted in significant R<sup>2</sup> values. Conclusion: It is inferred that the winter herbage minerals in all the districts were below the recommended levels for macro minerals which indicated there would be some mineral deficiencies in sheep grazing the herbage in these regions. Supplemental minerals may therefore play an important role in balancing the minerals available from the herbage in winter and would lead to increased productivity in sheep on the highland areas of China. These findings could be potentially applied to the other regions for improving the livestock productivity."

This essay is a pedagogical examination of the Five Aspects of Consciousness-Only, which aims to show why Kuiji organized them as he did.The Five Aspects of Consciousness-Only Buddhism consist of objective  conditions (境), interpretation of scripture (敎), principles (理), meditation and practice (行), and the fruit of Buddhahood (果). These five terms are not found in earlier Buddhist scriptures, and thus they can be considered as original terms defined by Kuiji. As for their respective meanings, the  aspect of objective conditions express the logic of Yogâcāra perceiving external objects from a perspective that focuses on what is observed cognitively. The aspect of interpretation lists teachings of Consciousness-Only as shown in various scriptures, while the aspect of principles analyzes the doctrine of Consciousness-Only as shown in scriptures based on the logic of transformation (轉變). Practice deals with the method of contemplating and observing the logic of Consciousness-Only and the practices related  to those teachings. Lastly, the fruit of Buddhahood explains wisdom and  the hierarchy of practice as the result of contemplating and observing the logic of Consciousness-Only.Based on the discussions appearing in each of these five aspects, this  study identifies key doctrines and further examines the background of Kuiji’s categorization of Yogâcāra teachings. The findings suggest that divisions within the structure of the ‘Triṃśikā-kārikā’ or ‘Ch'engwei-shih-jun’ were extended to the Five Aspects of Consciousness-Only by adding sections corresponding with ‘realization through teaching’ (敎證) and ‘realization through principle’ (理證) to cognitive objects (境), practice (行) and fruit (果). Kuiji particularly emphasized the importance of objective conditions. Expanding the discourse in the Dasheng Fayuan Yilin Chang, he further supplemented the aspect of objective conditions into six gates (六門). By doing so, he presumably attempted to reaffirm the core teaching of Consciousness-Only Buddhism, which is  that all phenomena are nothing but consciousness (萬法唯識). This was emphasized with an investigation into the denial of external objects (外境) from various points of view."

Although article 750 of the Korean Civil Code, which constitutes the general provision for tortious liability in Korean civil law, discriminates neither intent from negligence nor pure economic loss from other losses in terms of the prerequisites as well as effects of tortious liability, the Korean Supreme Court has adopted more or less cautious approach on the compensability of pure economic loss. The same or similar approach has been observed in other countries, even though the ways to achieve this result are different. Some limit compensability of pure economic loss categorically (U.S. and U.K.), while others acknowledge compensability of loss either when it is derived from the infringement of absolute right or from the intentional commission against good moral (Germany, Austria and Switzerland). There is still other country which allow the compensation of pure economic loss in principle (France). The question is whether and how this limitation of compensability of pure economic loss is justified. In this regard, legal doctrine does not help so much. It explains why pure economic loss should not be compensated at any time, while it does not explain why and when pure economic loss should be compensated. On the contrary, economic analysis provides better explanation why and when pure economic loss should be or not be compensated. The basic intuition is as follows: Pure economic loss is a matter of redistribution and not of social cost, which is the reason why negligent inflict of pure economic loss should not be compensated. It might lead to overcaution. Even intentional or conscious infringement of pure economic loss might be allowed because it is a participation of efficient breach. An intentional participation of inefficient breach, however, should be deterred by imposing liability on the third party participants. An unfair competition with illegal means such as fraud or duress also should be deterred by imposing liability on the competitor even when he or she used these means not on the victim directly but on the counterpart of the victim. Last but not least, liability for pure economic loss of the investors who relied on the inaccurate information can be regarded as quasi-contract liability, which is an imputed contract corresponding to the hypothetical mutual intent between the prospective investors and the auditors or any other information providers. This analysis can be integrated to the legal doctrine of tortious liability and provide more detailed criteria to decide whether to compensate pure economic loss."
Dynamic Modelling of Low-Temperature Batch In-Bin Drying of Cobed Seed Maize: an Industrial Case Study,2020,['Drying . Energy . Humidity . Modelling . Moisture . Temperature'],,"Purpose In this paper, dynamic models have been developed to predict the air temperature, specific humidity and drying rate in an industrial seed grain dryer.Methods An industrial dryer was utilised for experimental measurements. The dyer was modelled as a system of serial cells characterised by heat and mass transfer with air back-mixing. Model equations were solved numerically based on the Levenberg– Marquardt algorithm in MATLAB. The model response was optimised by signal matching technique. The sensitivity of the model parameters on the prediction accuracy was assessed using Monte Carlo simulation tests. The accuracy of the models was statistically checked using the coefficient of determination (R2), the root mean square error (RMSE), and the probability value (p value) approach.Results The results revealed a good agreement between the measured data and model predictions with the highest mean relative deviation (MRD) of 2.37% and p value of 0.0298 at 5% significance level. The model accuracy was highly sensitive to the parameter that defines the air residence time inside the drying bin. The dryer exhibited air back-mixing level of 45.8% and moisture decay rate constant (k) of 0.028 per hour. The convective heat transfer between the air and seed grain was determined as 0.96 kJ/h m2 °C.Conclusions The dynamic models developed here can adequately predict the outlet air temperature, specific humidity and solids temperature and subsequently the drying curve. The models could help to provide real-time insights of drying characteristics, which is necessary for the achievement of a stable and effective control of the drying process."
Comparison of Physical Fitness Factors of High School and College TAEKWONDO Athletes with Anaerobic Exercise and Isokinetic Muscle Function,2020,"['Competition Players', 'Physical Fitness', 'Lsokinetic Muscle Function', 'Anaerobic Capacity', 'Wingate Test']",,"Purpose: Considering the development curve, there may be individual differences, but in the 2nd and 3rd grades of high school, it can be seen that there is no significant difference from that of adults in form. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the differences in body composition and physical strength factors of Taekwondo Gyeorugi players who are attending morphological similar high school and university in form, and provide basic data for physical fitness training of athletes based on the results of this study.Method: The subjects of this study were 13 competition players attending G high school in D city and 13 com-petition players attending K University, and body composition, physical factors, anaerobic exercise ability, and knee joint isokinetic muscle function were tested. For data processing, the mean and standard deviation of the measured items were calculated using the SPSS 25.0 statistical program. An independent t-test was conducted to find out the difference between high school taekwondo players and college students taekwondo players.Results: University Taekwondo competition players were statistically significantly higher in height, lean body weight, and lower extremity than high school competition players, and their body fat percentage was lower. In terms of physical strength, college competition players were superior to high school athletes in terms of strength, endurance, quickness, agility, coordination, and flexibility. The anaerobic exercise ability was significantly higher in college athletes than high school athletes in Peak Power(W), Average Power(W), and Total Energy(J). It was also found that college athletes were superior to high school athletes in knee joint isokinetic muscle function measured at an angular velocity of 60 degrees.Conclusion: The statistically significant difference in the height and lower extremities, which are the physique factors, is judged as the result of not considering weight class in the selection of subjects for this study. The differ-ence in physical strength factors is thought to be a result of the higher athlete experience and training amount of college players than the difference in shape development."
Relationship between diet quality and sarcopenia in elderly Koreans: 2008–2011 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,2020,"['Frailty', 'sarcopenia', 'elderly', 'diet', 'public health']",,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Given the increasing proportion of the Korean population that is aged 65 years and older, the present study analyzed the relationship between diet quality and sarcopenia in elderly persons by using data from the 2008–2011 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES).SUBJECTS/METHODS: Data for 3,373 persons aged 65 years and over (men: 1,455, 43.1%) were selected from the 2008–2011 KNHANES. Sarcopenia assessments are based on a formula that divides a subject""s appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) by their weight (wt) and multiplies that result by 100 ([ASM/wt] × 100). Sarcopenia is present if the subject""s result was less than one standard deviation (SD) below the sex-specific mean for a young reference group. For evaluation of diet quality, data obtained via the 24-hour recall method were used to calculate the Diet Quality Index for Koreans (DQI-K). A general linear model was applied in order to analyze general information and nutritional intake according to sarcopenia status. For analysis of the relationship between diet quality and sarcopenia, a binominal logistic regression analysis was undertaken.RESULTS: The sarcopenia prevalence rate among the study subjects aged 65 years and over was 37.6%. The DQI-K of those without sarcopenia was 3.33 ± 0.04 points, while that of those with sarcopenia was 3.45 ± 0.04 points (P < 0.05). The relationship between diet quality and sarcopenia revealed that subjects aged 75 and older had a poor diet quality, and their odds ratio (OR) of sarcopenia presence was significantly higher (OR: 1.807, 95% confidence interval: 1.003–3.254, P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that poor diet quality was related to sarcopenia presence in Koreans aged 75 and older. In order to improve the diet quality of the elderly (aged 75 and older), it is necessary to develop dietary improvement guidelines."
Short Term Intake of Undaria pinnatifida Does Not Affect Bone Biomarkers in Young Korean Women with Low Calcium Intake,2020,"['Seaweed', 'Calcium', 'Vitamin D', 'Biomarkers', 'Koreans']",,"Calcium intake is essential for bone health, but young Korean women have low calcium intakes. Seaweeds have high calcium content, which may affect calcium metabolism. Twenty nine females aged 18-39 years with low calcium intake (< 400 mg/day) participated in a 19-day open-label randomized controlled trial. During the first five days, participants adhered to a controlled-feeding protocol followed by a two-week supplementation period in free-living conditions. The treatment group (n = 14) received an additional 200 mg Ca/day through Undaria pinnatifida and Porphyra in meals during the controlled-feeding period, and as U. pinnatifida noodles during days 6-19. Mineral intake (Ca, P, Mg, Na, and K) was assessed from diet composites and three 24-hour recalls during the controlled-feeding and free-living periods, respectively. Fasting serum levels of calcium, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]D), phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were assessed at baseline, day 6, and day 19. Statistical analyses were performed by Student's t-test and mixed ANOVA. Mean intakes of all minerals during days 1-5 and mean Ca and Mg intakes during days 6-19 were greater in the treatment group compared to the control group. No group effect or group and time interaction was observed in serum biomarkers. Serum 1,25(OH)D increased while PTH and ALP tended to decrease on day 6 but returned to baseline values on day 20. Short-term intake of U. pinnatifida and Porphyra does not affect calcium metabolism in young Korean women with low calcium intakes."
Electrical–Thermal–Mechanical Analysis of Focused Infrared Heating Process,2020,['Focused infrared heating · Local heat treatment · Elliptical reflector · Finite element method · Multi-physics analysis'],,"Demand of infrared (IR) heating technology has been increasing in industrial heat treatment processes to replace traditional heating methods because of this technology’s high energy efficiency. However, numerical analyses of IR heating have not been sufficiently reported. This work proposes a framework for electrical–thermal–mechanical analysis of a focused IR heating process using multi-physics analysis to obtain more information about the physical phenomenon. In the present model, the electrical-thermal analysis simulated the IR lamp converting electrical energy to infrared radiation, then the radiation heating and mechanical analyses of the target material was conducted. The temperature of the IR lamp in the simulation was 2357 °C (around 2600 K), which matches the well-known range of the temperatures (2500–3000 K) of IR lamps. For the radiation heating analysis, four simple models were proposed, based on geometrical-feature, to consider the distribution of IR radiation. With the present model, focused IR heating for a metal sheet was simulated and the results were compared to the experimental data. The normalized root mean square errors (RMSEs) of all of the proposed models were less than 10% for the central temperature, which is the most important heating position of the focused IR heating. The results show that the electrical–thermal–mechanical model provides good agreement with the measured data in predicting local heating eff ect of saving heating energy. In addition, this multi-physics simulation can provide information on the thermal expansion and stress distribution as well as the temperature field of the heated material."
Effects of Aging on Angiogenic and Muscle Growth-Related Factors in Naturally Aged Rat Skeletal Muscles,2020,"['Aging', 'Angiogenesis', 'Protein synthesis', 'Muscle type', 'Vascular endothelial growth factor A', 'mTOR']",,"Background: This study explored the effects of aging on the expression of angiogenic and muscle protein synthesis factors, as well as the number of satellite cells affecting sarcopenia in naturally aged rat skeletal muscles. Methods: We divided 16 Sprague-Dawley rats into young (12 weeks old, n=8) and old (24 months old, n=8) groups and compared muscle and body weight (BW) between them. We also analyzed the expression levels of angiogenic and muscle growth proteins in soleus (slow-twitch) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL; fast-twitch) muscles by western blotting and assessed the number of skeletal muscle satellite cells and myonuclei and mean fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) using by immunofluorescence staining. Results: EDL/BW was significantly lower in old rats than in young rats (p=0.002). The vascular endothelial growth factor level in soleus muscles was significantly lower in old rats than in young rats (p=0.001). Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha and fetal liver kinase 1 levels in EDL muscles were lower in old rats than in young rats (p=0.001). The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), p70S6K, and 4E-BP1 levels were significantly lower in the soleus muscles of old rats than in those of young rats (p<0.01). Similarly, insulin growth factor-1, Akt, mTOR, and p70S6K levels were significantly lower in EDL muscles of old rats than in those of young rats (p<0.01). Additionally, myonuclei/fiber, Pax7/fiber, and mean fiber CSAs in both muscle types were significantly lower in old rats than in young rats (p<0.01). Conclusion: These data suggest different regulation of indices of angiogenic and muscle growth with aging in different muscle types."

Traditionally, a qualitative analysis of love-centered lyrics should focus on several typical instances extracted from the whole samples, generalizing the characteristics of a specific writer or brief period. However, with the development of computer science and statistics, it now provides a new perspective for us to elucidate the true meanings behind the natural language texts without human beings’ subjective interpretations. This quantitative analysis method, on the one hand, can efficiently relieve the manual classification burdens and generate a more precise sorting result even than human beings' doing. On the other hand, the rigidly quantized classification criteria sometimes can also incur several enigmatic conclusions conflicting with people's intuitional judgment. To demonstrate the practicability of it, this paper hence chose to manipulate 5082 Korean love-centered lyrics collected from online with 2 kinds of considerably valuable topic models: LAD & STM, aimed to 1. verify the feasibility of automatically constructing a taxonomy system of love-centered lyrics; 2. examine and speculate a diachronic correlation between love-centered lyrics and published years. As a result, it is of great necessity to optimize the themes K selection when conducting a topic modeling experiment. And based on a reasonable classification, it is possible to observe a significant regressive trend on different groups of love-centered lyrics through years. But because of the performance limitation of topic modelling, there are still some biased cases that can be found, which implies a further improvement not just on technical parameter testing but also on a potential collaboration between quantitative and qualitative analysis."

Normative Values for Esophageal Motility Assessed in the Physiological Seated Position for 16-Channel Water Perfused High-resolution Esophageal Manometry System and Postural Variations in Healthy Volunteers,2020,"['Healthy volunteers', 'India', 'Normal values', 'Posture', 'Water perfused manometry']",,"Background/AimsConsensus guidelines for performance and analysis of high-resolution esophageal manometry (HREM) recommend use of equipment, population and posture specific normative values. To provide normative values for Chicago classification (CC) metrics in the physiological seated position for a 16-channel water perfused system (Dentsleeve HREM catheter, Advanced Manometry Systems, Melbourne, Australia) widely used in India and other countries with limited access to solid-state equipment. The results are compared with published CC metrics in supine position done using the same system and volunteers.MethodsHREM tracings of ten 5 mL water swallows in sitting posture were acquired in healthy volunteers and normative values for CC version 3.0 metrics calculated. Individual swallows were paired with previously reported supine swallows for postural variations (Wilcoxon sign rank test) and concordance of CC diagnoses (Pearson coefficient).ResultsAnalysis of 530 sitting posture water swallows (53 subjects) and comparison with their supine data revealed significantly higher integrated relaxation pressure (IRP; median 6.7 mmHg vs 6.1 mmHg) but lower distal latency (DL; mean 6.3 seconds vs 6.8 seconds) and distal contractile integral (DCI; mean 1224 mmHg·sec·cm vs 1456 mmHg·sec·cm). Sitting posture normal was defined as: IRP < 13.9, DL > 4.5, and DCI = 115-4500 (absent contractility: DCI < 30). CC diagnoses concordance using posture-specific cut-offs was moderate (k = 0.47).ConclusionsThis paper provides normative values for the Advanced Manometry Systems 16-channel water perfused system in the physiological seated position for CC metrics. Our findings of higher IRP and lower DCI in sitting posture than previously reported supine CC cut-offs, confirm the need to use posture-specific cut-offs for reporting HREM tracings."
"Investigation of Structural, Optical and Electrical Transport Properties of Yttrium Doped La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 Perovskites",2020,['Manganites · Rietveld refinement · UV/vis. spectroscopy · Mott’s variable range hopping (VRH) model · Small polaron hopping (SPH) model'],,"In the present study, bulk samples of yttrium doped La0.7−xYxCa0.3MnO3 (x = 0.3 and 0.4) are prepared through solid-state reaction route. The structural, optical and electrical transport properties have been explored through various analytical techniques. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns affirm single phase and polycrystalline nature of the samples. Rietveld refinement analysis of the XRD data is used to determine the various structural parameters. It reveals that both the samples belong to orthorhombic crystal system with Pnma space group. Using Scherrer’s equation, a lower value of crystallite size is found in the higher concentration of yttrium doped sample. The band gap as determined from the UV–visible DRS data by employing the Tauc’s relation is found to enhance with the increase of yttrium concentration in La0.7Ca0.3MnO3. The low temperature resistivity measurements establish semiconducting nature of the samples over the temperature range of ~ 110–300 K. Moreover, the electrical resistivity data are interpreted within the variable range hopping (VRH) model to estimate the density of states at the Fermi level N(EF), mean hopping distance Rh(T) and hopping energy Eh(T). It is observed that the electrical quantities vary gradually with the change of Y content. The conduction mechanism in this system is governed in the framework of thermally activated small polaron hopping (SPH) model and accordingly various parameters namely Debye temperature (θD), activation energy (Ep) and optical phonon frequency (νph) are evaluated. The obtained results support a strong connection between structure and electrical behavior in our samples and can be elucidated on the basis of localization of charge carriers induced by the substituting ions."

First, Dharmacakrapravartanasūtra provides clues to understand the ‘four noble truths and the destruction of fluxes,’ the standard form of Āgamas and the Nikāyas. That is, the discovery of and insights into the ‘four noble truths’ made five monks understand the intrinsic nature of things. Since the ‘five skandhas’ are impermanence and unsatisfactoriness, which are the three characteristics of existence, recognizing the groups as samyakdṛṣṭi that they are ‘self’ or ‘non-self’ leads to the destruction of fluxes and the complete nirvāṇa of arhat. Here, the keywords ‘four noble truths’ and the demonstration of the ‘anātman of five skandhas’ play critical roles in Sarvāstivādins' practice, such as abhisamaya. “Saṅgītiparyāya,’ the earliest text of Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma, explains that the ‘four noble truths’ are satya, and the recognition that ‘saṃskārā is anitya, sāsravā saṃskārā is duḥkha, and sarve dharmā is śūnya and anātman’ leads to the acquisition of laukikāgra-dharma and anāsrava, which corresponds with dharmajñānakṣānti. Such characteristics of sarve dharmā are suggested by the four ākāras of duḥkhasatya among the sixteen ākāras of the noble truths in later Saṅgītiparyāya. Moreover, fragmentary concepts were presented in more details than in “Dharmaskandha.” Meanwhile, Dharmaskandha’ presents four noble truths enlightened by Buddha as a model of practice, and it also briefly explains darśanaheyakleśaparihāṇa and bhāvanāheyakleśaprahāṇa which are eliminated by recognizing the ‘four noble truths.’Unlike “Saṅgītiparyāya” and “Dharmaskandha” that explain abhisamaya from the practical aspect of law, “Prakaraṇapāda” adopts ‘five categories’ rather than the ‘five skandhas’ to describe the concept and correlation of sarve dharmā in detail. Abhisamaya is the function of prajñā with a nature of dharmapravicaya, which is classified as one of caitasika that corresponds with mind. Prajñā is interpreted as dharmapravicaya or vipaśyanā here, suggesting that dharmapravicaya, a unique interpretation of Sarvāstivādin unlike the path of Āgamas and Nikāyas, would soon combine with the theory of practice. Such characteristics become more apparent in the stage of Mahāvibhāṣa, meaning that the “Analysis by the formation of character of sarve dharmā and the theory of practice which leads to the extinguishment of sufferings.”"

Using 3D scans of 625 men aged 35–64 in the 6th SizeKorea dataset, 173 scans (27.7%) of men in ‘abdominal obese’ category (BMI value of 25, waist girth to height ratio of 0.53, and waist girth to hip girth ratio of 0.9 or higher) were utilized. We developed a script to measure 38 items such as front/back crotch length and front/back depths and angles using the SNU-BM program, which is a script-based automated 3D body scan measurement software. The measurements used for principal component (PC) analysis were 31 drops, 2 heights, 2 lengths and 4 angles. Ten PCs representing distinctive silhouettes and profiles of lower body shapes were extracted. The PCs were interpreted as follows: abdomen prominence, thigh to knee profile, upper buttocks prominence, waist to hip drop, thigh to knee silhouette, lower body tilt angle, waist to crotch length, vertical height, abdomen to crotch height, and lower buttocks slope. The three body shape groups were categorized using a K means cluster analysis with ten PC scores. Group 1 had a flat abdomen but prominent buttocks. Group 2 had a developed abdomen and buttocks with vertical thighs. Group 3 had drooped buttocks with tilted thighs."

But there is a limit to how far Korea can be called an “open society” for the refugees. The system exists, but only with a limited scope of acceptance. Also, there is an absence of social consensus on how to approach the refugees, psychologically, culturally or policy-wise. For this reason, the main discussion of the refugees so far has only proceeded under the concept of human rights and national sovereignty. However, South Korea, as a nation aspiring to be inclusive, is at a point in time where it needs to think about how to accommodate the strangers within its territory, as the refugees’ request to enter the country continues. Therefore, this article aims to seek the direction of social engagement of the refugees. In particular, it suggests a cultural approach to narrow down the social distance between the citizens and refugees and form new relationships. To this end, we look at the meaning of social exclusion and inclusion, present the framework of conviviality, and discuss it through the cases of the U.K. and several other European countries with prior experiences. Using the framework of conviviality, we analyze the refugee-related arts and cultural activities at Coun-terpoint Arts in the U.K. and find that such activities work as a good medium to share the values of diversity and equality. Moreover, they facilitate reciprocal understanding between people. Thus, the arts and cultural approach may be a practical alternative to achieve a convivial society as it can contribute to expansion of one’s mind and enhance social cohesion."

This study focused on the adverbs in the Hangul letters which differ from contemporary Korean adverbs in terms of their morphological, syntactic, or semantic properties. This study also outlined the historical changes that the adverbs have undergone by examining adverbs in corpora, such as the 21st Century Sejong Project, and the several dictionaries of archaic words, such as The Lexical Dictionary of Hangeul Letters in Joseon Period.  Unlike their contemporary Korean counterparts, some adverbs in the Hangul letters have an adverb suffix attached to an adjective stem, adverb, or Sino-Korean root, such as ‘dyohi, mai/mʌi,’ ‘neuri, magi,’ ‘beulgyeongi, bulcheukhi, soyoi, Jeomjeomi, cheungyeolhi.’ However, some adverbs in the Hangul letters omitted the adverb suffix, such as nanal, daedan/dʌydan, eolnyeon, teumteum, gakbyeol, jʌsye/jʌsi, jigeuk, geupgeup, gansin, tʌypyeong, and some even omitted a postpositional particle or part of a root, such as ‘uioe’ and ‘jam, jʌk.’  Some adverbs showing syntactical differences are ‘jyangsi,’ which is used as a noun in contemporary Korean, and ‘dasina, bʌlsyeona,’ to which a postpositional particle ‘na’ is attached in contemporary Korean. Also, ‘mai, chyeonman’ can modify more verbs and ‘dʌygwanjyeol, beudui’ can be followed by various mood types, unlike their counterparts in contemporary Korean. Some adverbs, such as ‘geudʌyji, mischeo, byeolno, chʌma’ can modify both negative and positive expressions, while their counterparts in contemporary Korean can only modify negative expressions.  In addition, some adverbs, such as ‘basbi, amado, jʌsye/jʌsi’ have a different meaning from their counterparts in contemporary Korean. Some adverbs are not used in contemporary Korean, such as ‘gojʌkhi, gogoi, ideugi, yeoguidai, orogi, yoksayoksai, gajirok, geudʌydorok, daedoe, jʌru/jʌro, hyeonma, hyeolma.’  This study showed that some adverbs, such as ‘magi, yeoguidai, orogi, cheungyeolhi, teumteum, tʌypyeong,’ have not yet been reported in any corpora or archaic dictionaries, and some adverbs, such as ‘geupgeup, dʌygwanjyeol, bulcheukhi, Jeomjeomi,’ are not in the dictionaries of archaic words.

Participants included middle and high school students who agreed to participate in the research and were recommended by the teacher in charge at the Wee Center. A total of 12 participants were divided into an experimental group and a comparison group with 6 participants each.The experimental group went through group art therapy, whereas the comparison group went through art activity in an art curriculum. For this research, 90-minute sessions were conducted once a week from September 2, 2019 to November 18, 2019, for a total of 12 times. The Korean version of the empathy quotient-short form (EQ-short-K), school adjustment scale, patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7) and Draw-a-Story (DAS) were used as measurements in this study. The data were analyzed using paired t-test and by comparing the pre-mean and post-mean values of the experimental group and the comparison group. The results of this study showed that there was a significant positive effect on the adaptation and empathy of adolescents.Also, while depression and anxiety were found to decrease in both the experimental group and comparison group, the effect was found to be more significant in the experimental group. Our conclusions are as follows. First, group art therapy run by art therapist helps adolescents to adapt to school who are receiving commissioned education at the hospital-type Wee Center. Second, both group art therapy and art activities in an art curriculum have a positive effect on reducing depression. Third, due to the nature of the hospital-type Wee Center, it is necessary for an art therapist, who can handle both the dynamics of a group and the advantages of art program, to intervene.Therefore, the implication of this research is that our results are meaningful as a base data for the effective application and development of art therapy at the hospital-type Wee Center."
Experimental study of wind-induced pressures on tall buildings of different shapes,2020,"['tall buildings', 'wind pressure', 'interference factor', 'mean pressure coefficients (Cp)', 'blockage', 'wind tunnel']",,"The modern tall buildings are often constructed as an unconventional plan and as twin buildings. Wind load on the tall building is significantly influenced by the presence of another building in the near vicinity. So, it is imperative to study wind forces on an unconventional plan shaped tall building. Mean wind pressure coefficients of a square and ‘H’ plan shape tall buildings are investigated using wind tunnel experiments. The experiments were carried out for various wind directions from 00 to 900 at an interval of 300 and various locations of the identical interfering building. The experimental results are presented at the windward face from the viewpoint of effects on cladding design. To quantify the interference effects, interference factors (I.F) are calculated. Mean pressure coefficients of both models are compared for isolated and interference conditions. The results show that pressure reduces with an increase in wind angle till 600 wind direction. The interfering building at full blockage interference condition generates more suction than the other two conditions. The interference factor for both models is less than unity. H-plan building model is subjected to a higher pressure than the square model."
Finite element model updating of long-span cable-stayed bridge by Kriging surrogate model,2020,"['cable-stayed bridge', 'fatigue life', 'health monitoring', 'mean stress effect', 'model updating', 'surrogate model']",,"In the finite element modelling of long-span cable-stayed bridges, there are a lot of uncertainties brought about by the complex structural configuration, material behaviour, boundary conditions, structural connections, etc. In order to reduce the discrepancies between the theoretical finite element model and the actual static and dynamic behaviour, updating is indispensable after establishment of the finite element model to provide a reliable baseline version for further analysis. Traditional sensitivity-based updating methods cannot support updating based on static and dynamic measurement data at the same time. The finite element model is required in every optimization iteration which limits the efficiency greatly. A convenient but accurate Kriging surrogate model for updating of the finite element model of cable-stayed bridge is proposed. First, a simple cable-stayed bridge is used to verify the method and the updating results of Kriging model are compared with those using the response surface model. Results show that Kriging model has higher accuracy than the response surface model. Then the method is utilized to update the model of a long-span cable-stayed bridge in Hong Kong. The natural frequencies are extracted using various methods from the ambient data collected by the Wind and Structural Health Monitoring System installed on the bridge. The maximum deflection records at two specific locations in the load test form the updating objective function. Finally, the fatigue lives of the structure at two cross sections are calculated with the finite element models before and after updating considering the mean stress effect. Results are compared with those calculated from the strain gauge data for verification."
Evaluation of opportunity based urban road network accessibility using GIS,2020,"['Accessibility', 'Opportunity', 'Weights', 'Mean weighted accessibility index', 'GIS']",,"The structural performance of any transport network may be mainly evaluated using connectivity, accessibility, hierarchy and morphology.

First, North Korean immigrant men signified their re-migration as a plan to overcome life crises experienced as men/heads of family in South Korean society and to change their family status. Second, they judged that by moving to British society, they were able to function reliably as breadwinners and thus play a minimal role as ‘head of household.’ Third, this self-assessment and New Malden’s special locational characteristics have led them to various ‘social activities.’ Combining the cultural elements of North Korea and the hegemonic masculinity of the U.K., these ‘social activities’ can be regarded as both the achievement of their transnational migration and attempts to construct their identity as valuable and respected men."

King Wongseong, who practically reformed the late Silla era (下代), tried to strengthen his kingdom by serving his prince because he was abnormally crowned. However, unlike his willing, Silla society in the late 8th c entury to early 9th c entury was politic ally very c onfused.Apart from the political situation, there was a peculiar phenomenon in Buddhism at this period. Monuments were built to establish temples or memorials of the ancient monarchs around King Wonseong. Before the crowning of King Wonseong, the father and mother of King Wonseong built Mujang Temple(鍪藏寺) and Galhang Temple(葛項寺), and their descendants continued to do Buddhist activities even after they came to the throne. King Ejang, who banned Shinchangbulsa(新創佛寺), also founded Haein Temple in his third year of reign(802). A year earlier, Gyeonghwa(桂花夫人), the mother of King Ejang, also built Amitabha in the Mujang Temple(鍪藏寺) worship her husband.The ancestors of King Wonseong were the forces that were pushed out of the mainstream throughout the middle period of Silla(中代). The middle period of Silla(中代) was a period in which power was secured around the direct descendants of King Muyeol, and the forces that were pushed out of the mainstream were born.Kim Kyungshin(King Wongseong) set up a transitional period for his ascension by placing King Yangsang(King Seondeok), who is close to the royal family at that time, in the confused gap of the King Hyegong. King Seondeok dies without aftermath and defeated Kim Joowon, eventually himself became the king. Therefore, King Wongseong had to present the vision of a new Silla society different from the previous era.It was Buddhism that King Wongseong presented as a vision of a new society. King Wongseong had to claim that the late period of Silla(下代) was different from the middle period of Silla(中代) and in that way, he pursuit the Middle-Ancient period of Silla(中古期). It is a remembranc e phenomenon of Lee Chadon, Ado, Wonhyo and Shinheng. So, the prohibition of Shinchangbulsa(新創佛寺) in the 7th year of King Ejang (806) can also be understood in the same context as the policy of King Wonseong. The time of prohibition of Shinchangbulsa(新創佛寺) and the time when remembrance was made about Lee Chadon(異次頓), Ado(阿道), Wonhyo(元曉) and Shinheng(神行) were same period.In addition, the ban on the usage of luxury goods, along with the prohibition of the Shinchangbulsa(新創佛寺), was intended to control the ec onomic base of the Jingol aristoc rats. This was due to the lac k of justification for the right of kings who had suffered in common with kings of the late period of Silla(下代) including King Wonseong. Because they were all threatened by kingship for different reasons, there were forces that threatened their throne. By regulating them, we can see that the intention was to increase the king's authority by distinguishing the king from the Jingol(眞骨) aristocrats."
