A Comparative Study of Unsupervised Deep Learning Methods for MRI Reconstruction,2020,"['MRI reconstruction', 'Unsupervised deep learning', 'Prior information', 'Data distribution']",,"Recently, unsupervised deep learning methods have shown great potential in image processing. Compared with a large-amount demand for paired training data of supervised methods with a specific task, unsupervised methods can learn a universal and explicit prior information on data distribution and integrate it into the reconstruction process. Therefore, it can be used in various image reconstruction environments without showing degraded performance. The importance of unsupervised learning in MRI reconstruction appears to be growing. Nevertheless, the establishment of prior formulation in unsupervised deep learning varies a lot depending on mathematical approximation and network architectures.

Detecting Anomalies in Time-Series Data using Unsupervised Learning and Analysis on Infrequent Signatures,2020,"['Industrial Control System Security Threat Detection', 'Anomaly Detection', 'Time-series data', 'Stackd-GRU', 'Frequency Analysis', 'Unsupervised learning', 'TaPR']",,"We propose a framework called Stacked Gated Recurrent Unit - Infrequent Residual Analysis (SG-IRA) that detects anomalies in time-series data that can be trained on streams of raw sensor data without any pre-labeled dataset. To enable such unsupervised learning, SG-IRA includes an estimation model that uses a stacked Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) structure and an analysis method that detects anomalies based on the difference between the estimated value and the actual measurement (residual). SG-IRA’s residual analysis method dynamically adapts the detection threshold from the population using frequency analysis, unlike the baseline model that relies on a constant threshold. In this paper, SG-IRA is evaluated using the industrial control systems (ICS) datasets. SG-IRA improves the detection performance (F1 score) by 5.9% compared to the baseline model."
A study on defect detection in X-ray image castings based on unsupervised learning,2020,"['Defect detection', 'X-ray image', 'Castings', 'Unsupervised', 'Deep learning']",,"In this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based defect detection system for the non-destructive quality inspection of castings based on X-ray images. Our system comprises a defect classification network and a defect search network and achieves high classifi-cation performance with limited data by minimizing the overfitting for one type of object. The proposed defect classification network determines whether the acquired X-ray image is Defect by using a convolution neural network and outputs the defect probability through softmax. Compared to binarized defect classification or defect location tracking, this method of outputting the defect proba-bility does not require a separate reworking of the training dataset, because the data labeling is the same as the existing quality evalu-ation task. In addition, to detect the location of the defect causing the defect classification, our proposed defect search network estimates the region where the defect is likely to exist through a Grad-CAM based on the feature map of the classification network. The proposed network then determines the ROI around each peak of the estimated regions and detects the exact shape and location of the defect through boundary detection. It is, therefore, possible to minimize quality control costs through a precise quality analysis of each casting product by simultaneously detecting small defects that are easy to ignore because large defects are found in the image. To verify the validity of this study, an experiment was conducted by constructing a dataset of actual cast products, and the proposed detection model achieved an accuracy of 90%. In addition, by comparing the fully connected network and the SVM-based model, the model improved by about 20%, demonstrating that it is possible to detect defects without labeling defect locations."

In order to solve the problems of conventional image registration approaches, such as long computational time, recent deep-learning supervised and unsupervised methods have been extensively studied because of their excellent performance and fast computational time. In this study, we propose a deep-learningbased network for deformable medical image registration using unsupervised learning.Materials and Methods: In this paper, we solve the image-registration optimization problem by modelling a function using a convolutional neural network with polyphase decomposition to learn the spatial transformable parameters based on the input images and to generate the registration field. A spatial transformer is used to reconstruct the output warped image while imposing smoothness constraints on the registration field. With polyphase decomposition, our proposed method learns more features based on the input image pairs without the need for any ground-truth registration field.Results: Experimental results using 3D T1 brain MRI volume scans and compared with state-of-the-art image-registration methods demonstrated that our method provides better 3D-image registration.Conclusion: Our proposed method uses less computational time in registering unseen pairs of input images during inference and can be applied for other unimodal image registration tasks, and the hyper-parameters can be adjusted for the specific task."

Noise2Atom: unsupervised denoising for scanning transmission electron microscopy images,2020,['Denoising STEM images Deep learning Unsupervised learning'],,"We propose an effective deep learning model to denoise scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image series, named Noise2Atom, to map images from a source domain S S to a target domain C C , where S S is for our noisy experimental dataset, and C C is for the desired clear atomic images. Noise2Atom uses two external networks to apply additional constraints from the domain knowledge. This model requires no signal prior, no noise model estimation, and no paired training images. The only assumption is that the inputs are acquired with identical experimental configurations. To evaluate the restoration performance of our model, as it is impossible to obtain ground truth for our experimental dataset, we propose consecutive structural similarity (CSS) for image quality assessment, based on the fact that the structures remain much the same as the previous frame(s) within small scan intervals. We demonstrate the superiority of our model by providing evaluation in terms of CSS and visual quality on different experimental datasets."

In order to improve the diagnostic rate of faults in engineering applications, in this paper, a new unsupervised machine learning algorithm, which is based on one-class support vector machine (OSVM), afnity propagation (AP) and Gaussian mixture model (GMM), called OAGFD is proposed for fault diagnosis. OSVM was frstly used to divide samples of marine turbocharger system into normal and fault samples, and only the fault samples are used in following steps to identify specifc fault types. The AP was adopted automatically to provide an initial value for expectation maximization, which can obtain the maximum value of iteration parameters. The GMM is used to classify faults of marine turbocharger system and output the fault diagnosis results. Finally, the OAGFD is validated by actual data. The experiment results show that OAGFD can quickly and accurately be trained. The OAGFD method can achieve higher identifcation accuracy for multi-faults of marine turbocharger system and takes on faster operation speed and stronger generalization ability than tradition methods. It is an efcient and unsupervised fault diagnosis technique and has both theoretical and practical value.

Especially in indoor localization environment, that is one of the most concerningtopic of smart cities, internet of things and wireless sensor networks. Many technologies are being used for localization purposein indoor environment and Wi-Fi using received signal strengths(RSSs) is one of them. Wi-Fi RSSs are sensitive to reflection, refraction, interference and channel noise that cause irregularity insignal strengths. The irregular and anomalous RSS values, used ina Wi-Fi indoor localization environment, cannot define the locationof any unknown node correctly. Therefore, this research has developed an outlier detection technique named as iF_Ensemblefor Wi-Fi indoor localization environment by analyzing RSSs using the combination of supervised, unsupervised and ensemble machine learning methods. In this research isolation forest (iForest)is used as an unsupervised learning method.

However, they still suffer from the lack of sufficient training data due to difficulty of obtaining a large amount of low-/normal-light image pairs in real environments. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning approach for single low-light image enhancement using the bright channel prior (BCP), which gives the constraint that the brightest pixel in a small patch is likely to be close to 1. With this prior, pseudo ground-truth is first generated to establish an unsupervised loss function. The proposed enhancement network is then trained using the proposed unsupervised loss function. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt that performs a low-light image enhancement through unsupervised learning. In addition, we introduce a self-attention map for preserving image details and naturalness in the enhanced result. We validate the proposed method on various public datasets, demonstrating that our method achieves competitive performance over state-of-the-arts."

Accurate assessment of the status of students’ knowledge, and individualized instruction development based on this, demands extensive effort from instructors. The objective of this study is to accurately analyze the knowledge status of students with minimal inputs by utilizing unsupervised learning techniques. A set of ten questions, reflecting six components has been devised in this study and students’ item responses have been collected by conducting computer-based tests with ninety-five students.

Response patterns of individual groups have been analyzed and visualized in terms of the items and components. Such clustering analysis offers the opportunity to easily identify the strengths and weaknesses of each group. Specifically, clustering analysis reveals different response patterns of students with the same total scores. Additionally, it was observed that low-achieving students indicated diverse patterns in their responses as compared to the higher-achieving students.

In particular, dementia care costs, including indirect costs such as increased care costs due to lost caregiver hours and caregivers, have grown exponentially over the years. In order to reduce these costs, it is urgent to introduce a management system to care for dementia patients. Therefore, this study proposes a sensor-based abnormal behavior detection system to manage dementia patients who live alone or in an environment where they cannot always take care of dementia patients. Existing studies were merely evaluating behavior or evaluating normal behavior, and there were studies that perceived behavior by processing images, not data from sensors. In this study, we recognized the limitation of real data collection and used both the auto-encoder, the unsupervised learning model, and the LSTM, the supervised learning model. Autoencoder, an unsupervised learning model, trained normal behavioral data to learn patterns for normal behavior, and LSTM further refined classification by learning behaviors that could be perceived by sensors. The test results show that each model has about 96% and 98% accuracy and is designed to pass the LSTM model when the autoencoder outlier has more than 3%. The system is expected to effectively manage the elderly and dementia patients who live alone and reduce the cost of caring."

Recently, the health state of the ship s main engine can be measured in real time using a sensor attached to the ship, enabling an user to detect abnormal signs of the engine early on the basis of the collected big data. This study proposes a methodology for early identification of abnormal signs of the ship main engine by learning the ship main engine data collected for more than 7 months.

This paper introduces a novel application of a deep learning framework called deep belief networks (DBNs) that can be used to predict the predicting academic performance of larger datasets. First, unsupervised training is considered a so-called pre-training section. The stacked restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) was trained to obtain the trained weights instead of random initial weights. Subsequently, supervised learning was adopted using backpropagation in the fine-tuning section to classify the student performance levels. An optimization approach for improving the classification performance of the proposed DBN was proposed. The optimization approach consisted of using a feature selection method to obtain the optimal feature subset, optimizing the DBN model with the optimal values of the hyperparameters, and applying the L2-regularization method for weight decay. The experiment was carried out with two phases. Phase1 was implemented with an actual dataset. Phase 2 was then implemented with four artificial datasets of increasing sizes. Many experiments were performed independently on each dataset. With a larger dataset, the improved DBN generated the highest accuracy and lowest root mean square error with more accuracy and effectiveness than the other proposed algorithms."

While existing map technologies may assist vehicles in identifying their locations via Global Positioning System, it is however difficult to update the environmental changes of roadways in these maps. Roadway vision algorithms can be useful for building autonomous vehicles that can avoid accidents and detect real-time location changes. We incorporate a hybrid architectural design that combines unsupervised classification of vision data with supervised joint fusion classification to achieve a better noise-resistant algorithm. We identify, via a deep learning approach, an intelligent hybrid fusion algorithm for fusing multimodal vision feature data for roadway classifications and characterize its improvement in accuracy over unsupervised identifications using image processing and supervised vision classifiers.

Document Image Binarization by GAN with Unpaired Data Training,2020,"['document image binarization', 'unpaired training data', 'gan', 'unsupervised learning']",,"Data is critical in deep learning but the scarcity of data often occurs in research, especially in the preparation of the paired training data. In this paper, document image binarization with unpaired data is studied by introducing adversarial learning, excluding the need for supervised or labeled datasets. However, the simple extension of the previous unpaired training to binarization inevitably leads to poor performance compared to paired data training. Thus, a new deep learning approach is proposed by introducing a multidiversity of higher quality generated images. In this paper, a two-stage model is proposed that comprises the generative adversarial network (GAN) followed by the U-net network. In the first stage, the GAN uses the unpaired image data to create paired image data. With the second stage, the generated paired image data are passed through the U-net network for binarization. Thus, the trained U-net becomes the binarization model during the testing. The proposed model has been evaluated over the publicly available DIBCO dataset and it outperforms other techniques on unpaired training data. The paper shows the potential of using unpaired data for binarization, for the first time in the literature, which can be further improved to replace paired data training for binarization in the future."

Automatic Determination of the Number of Clusters for Semi-Supervised Relational Fuzzy Clustering,2020,"['Semi-supervised clustering', 'Relational data', 'Fuzzy clustering', 'Local distance measure learning', 'Optimal number of clusters']",,"Semi-supervised clustering relies on both labeled and unlabeled data to steer the clustering process towards optimal categorization and escape from local minima. In this paper, we propose a novel fuzzy relational semi-supervised clustering algorithm based on an adaptive local distance measure (SSRF-CA). The proposed clustering algorithm utilizes side-information and formulates it as a set of constraints to supervise the learning task. These constraints are expressed using reward and penalty terms, which are integrated into a novel objective function. In particular, we formulate the clustering task as an optimization problem through the minimization of the proposed objective function. Solving this optimization problem provides the optimal values of different objective function parameters and yields the proposed semi-supervised clustering algorithm. Along with its ability to perform data clustering and learn the underlying dissimilarity measure between the data instances, our algorithm determines the optimal number of clusters in an unsupervised manner. Moreover, the proposed SSRF-CA is designed to handle relational data. This makes it appropriate for applications where only pairwise similarity (or dissimilarity) information between data instances is available. In this paper, we proved the ability of the proposed algorithm to learn the appropriate local distance measures and the optimal number of clusters while partitioning the data using various synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets that contain varying numbers of clusters with diverse shapes. The experimental results revealed that the proposed SSRF-CA accomplished the best performance among other state-of-the-art algorithms and confirmed the outperformance of our clustering approach."

Over the past decades, text mining technologies have been utilized in various industries for practical applications. In the field of business intelligence, it has been employed to discover new market and/or technology opportunities and support rational decision making of business participants.  The market information such as market size, market growth rate, and market share is essential for setting companies’ business strategies. There has been a continuous demand in various fields for specific product level-market information. However, the information has been generally provided at industry level or broad categories based on classification standards, making it difficult to obtain specific and proper information.  In this regard, we propose a new methodology that can estimate the market sizes of product groups at more detailed levels than that of previously offered. We applied Word2Vec algorithm, a neural network based semantic word embedding model, to enable automatic market size estimation from individual companies’ product information in a bottom-up manner. The overall process is as follows: First, the data related to product information is collected, refined, and restructured into suitable form for applying Word2Vec model. Next, the preprocessed data is embedded into vector space by Word2Vec and then the product groups are derived by extracting similar products names based on cosine similarity calculation. Finally, the sales data on the extracted products is summated to estimate the market size of the product groups. As an experimental data, text data of product names from Statistics Koreas microdata (345,103 cases) were mapped in multidimensional vector space by Word2Vec training. We performed parameters optimization for training and then applied vector dimension of 300 and window size of 15 as optimized parameters for further experiments. We employed index words of Korean Standard Industry Classification (KSIC) as a product name dataset to more efficiently cluster product groups. The product names which are similar to KSIC indexes were extracted based on cosine similarity. The market size of extracted products as one product category was calculated from individual companies’ sales data. The market sizes of 11,654 specific product lines were automatically estimated by the proposed model. For the performance verification, the results were compared with actual market size of some items. The Pearsons correlation coefficient was 0.513.  Our approach has several advantages differing from the previous studies. First, text mining and machine learning techniques were applied for the first time on market size estimation, overcoming the limitations of traditional sampling based- or multiple assumption required-methods. In addition, the level of market category can be easily and efficiently adjusted according to the purpose of information use by changing cosine similarity threshold. Furthermore, it has a high potential of practical applications since it can resolve unmet needs for detailed market size information in public and private sectors. Specifically, it can be utilized in technology evaluation and technology commercialization support program conducted by governmental institutions, as well as business strategies consulting and market analysis report publishing by private firms.  The limitation of our study is that the presented model needs to be improved in terms of accuracy and reliability. The semantic-based word embedding module can be advanced by giving a proper order in the preprocessed dataset or by combining another algorithm such as Jaccard similarity with Word2Vec. Also, the methods of product group clustering can be changed to other types of unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Our gro"

앙상블 모델 기반의 기계 고장 예측 방법,2020,"['Ensemble Model', 'Anomaly Detection', 'STL and GESD', 'Clustering', 'Failure Prediction']",,"There have been a lot of studies in the past for the method of predicting the failure of a machine, and recently, a lot of researches and applications have been generated to diagnose the physical condition of the machine and the parts and to calculate the remaining life through various methods. Survival models are also used to predict plant failures based on past anomaly cycles. In particular, special machine that reflect the fluid flow and process characteristics of chemical plants are connected to hundreds or thousands of sensors, so there are not many factors that need to be considered, such as process and material data as well as application of derivative variables. In this paper, the data were preprocessed through time series anomaly detection based on unsupervised learning to predict the abnormalities of these special machine. Next, clustering results reflecting clustering-based data characteristics were applied to produce additional variables, and a learning data set was created based on the history of past facility abnormalities. Finally, the prediction methodology based on the supervised learning algorithm was applied, and the model update was confirmed to improve the accuracy of the prediction of facility failure. Through this, it is expected to improve the efficiency of facility operation by flexibly replacing the maintenance time and parts supply and demand by predicting abnormalities of machine and extracting key factors."
A Fast Surface Defect Detection Method based on Background Reconstruction,2020,['Defect detection Unsupervised learning Background reconstruction'],,"In this paper, we propose an unsupervised background reconstruction method to detect defects on surfaces with unevenly distributed textures. An improved deep convolutional autoencoder is utilized to reconstruct the textured background of the original image as a defect-free reference. Specifically, a weighted loss function based on structural similarity (SSIM) is utilized to adapt to the unevenly distributed texture background and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Furthermore, combined with the reconstructed defect-free reference, a novel difference analysis method based on the discrete cosine transform (DCT) is given to accurately segment the defect regions from the original image. A series of experiments for the defect detection on mobile phone cover glass (MPCG) are conducted. The processing time for an image of 512 × 512 pixels is only 20 ms, which satisfies the requirement of online detection. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method."

An experiment was conducted to measure the user's EEG signals by separating men and women, and a single channel EEG device was used for EEG signal measurements. The results of measuring users' EEG signals using EEG devices were analyzed using R. In addition, data in the study was predicted using a 80:20 ratio between training data and test data by applying a combination of specific vectors with the highest classifying performance of the SVM, and thus the predicted accuracy of 93.2% of the recognition rate.

While previous studies focused on enabling the actual use of speaking knowledge acquired in everyday life, this changed over time to academic purpose-oriented or discussion-oriented research in a particular language region. In particular, speech evaluation studies have been continuing since the beginning to the present, and the trend has been changing from development studies to scoring comparison studies. As a future task, variable studies should be conducted on the review and evaluation environment to strengthen the validity and reliability of speaking questions. It is also necessary to study speaking for multilingual learners with diverse purposes in academic speaking research. Moreover, research on speaking has a strong identity between each topic and key words and therefore, it is necessary to strengthen convergence and linkage with other topics."

The target vowels were restricted to those produced by adult males. The k was increased stepwise from 3 to 9 to see what phonological features appeared to be active in separating a new cluster from the originating cluster. It was found that the feature [±back] is one of the primary features that differentiates vowel classes and the feature [±high] is used in subsequent separations of the vowel classes. It was also found that high confusability in the perception of vowels is attributable to overlapping distributions of the samples. Vowel duration is critical in clarifying /ɔ/ and /ʌ/, and /ɛ/ and /æ/ as was reported in Hillendbrand et al. (2000).

Self-presentation of the hosts can make a positive effect on listing performance by eliminating psychological distance through emotional interaction with users. This paper analyzed the self-presentation text provided by Airbnb hosts and found key aspects in the text. In order to extract the aspects from the text, host descriptions were separated into sentences and applied the Attention-Based Aspect Extraction method, an unsupervised neural attention model. Then, we investigated the relationship between aspects in the host description and the listing performance via linear regression models. In order to compare their impact between the three facility types(Entire home/apt, Private rooms, and Shared rooms), the interaction effects between the facility types and the aspect summaries were included in the model. We found that specific aspects had positive effects on the performance for each facility type, and provided implication on the marketing strategy to maximize the performance of the shared economy."

In order to determine damage types of the enemy unit: no damage, light wound, heavy wound and death, Monte carlo simulation is performed to apply the Carlton damage function for the damage effect of the soft targets. In addition, in order to achieve the damage effectiveness of the enemy units in line with the commander's intention, the optimal shot numbers and aiming point locations are calculated in less than 0.4 seconds by applying the k-mean clustering and repetitive Monte carlo simulation.

A fast approximate fitting for mixture of multivariate skew t-distribution via EM algorithm,2020,"['mixture model', 'CFUST', 'approximate t-cdf', 'EM algorithm']",,"A mixture of multivariate canonical fundamental skew t-distribution (CFUST) has been of interest in various fields. In particular, interest in the unsupervised learning society is noteworthy. However, fitting the model via EM algorithm suffers from significant processing time. The main cause is due to the calculation of many multivariate t-cdfs (cumulative distribution functions) in E-step. In this article, we provide an approximate, but fast calculation method for the in univariate fashion, which is the product of successively conditional univariate t-cdfs with Taylor's first order approximation. By replacing all multivariate t-cdfs in E-step with the proposed approximate versions, we obtain the admissible results of fitting the model, where it gives 85% reduction time for the 5 dimensional skewness case of the Australian Institution Sport data set. For this approach, discussions about rough properties, advantages and limits are also presented."

Impurity profiling and chemometric analysis of methamphetamine seizures in Korea,2020,"['methamphetamine', 'impurity profiling', 'chemometric analysis', 'GC-FID/MS']",,"Methamphetamine (MA) is currently the most abused illicit drug in Korea. MA is produced by chemical synthesis, and the final target drug that is produced contains small amounts of the precursor chemicals, intermediates, and by-products. To identify and quantify these trace compounds in MA seizures, a practical and feasible approach for conducting chromatographic fingerprinting with a suite of traditional chemometric methods and recently introduced machine learning approaches was examined. This was achieved using gas chromatography (GC) coupled with a flame ionization detector (FID) and mass spectrometry (MS). Following appropriate examination of all the peaks in 71 samples, 166 impurities were selected as the characteristic components. Unsupervised (principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and K-means clustering) and supervised (partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), support vector machines (SVM), and deep neural network (DNN) with Keras) chemometric techniques were employed for classifying the 71 MA seizures. The results of the PCA, HCA, K-means clustering, PLS-DA, OPLS-DA, SVM, and DNN methods for quality evaluation were in good agreement. However, the tested MA seizures possessed distinct features, such as chirality, cutting agents, and boiling points. The study indicated that the established qualitative and semi-quantitative methods will be practical and useful analytical tools for characterizing trace compounds in illicit MA seizures. Moreover, they will provide a statistical basis for identifying the synthesis route, sources of supply, trafficking routes, and connections between seizures, which will support drug law enforcement agencies in their effort to eliminate organized MA crime."

The meaning field of ‘civilization’ across this period was characterized through a ‘top-down’ analysis of the keyword “civilization” together with a list of synonyms adduced by machine learning, using an unsupervised learning algorithm called ‘Word2Vec’.Between 1906 and 1910, the relative usage of the concept of 'civilization' fluctuated greatly, rising sharply until 1908, and falling sharply after 1909. At the peak, in 1908, terms related to evolutionary development and the market economy formed a dense list of synonyms. But In 1909 and 1910, various terms occurred which could not be clustered or which differ in character when compared to the earlier period.Based on these characteristics, the features of the meaning of ‘civilization’ in the targeted articles can be summarized as follows: First, those related to social evolution and Asianism. Second, those related to the economic field and daily discourse. Third, those related to the formation of discipline and character and the formation of an aesthetic disposition. These characteristics show how the internal and psychological process of civilization follows the external and structural process of civilization.The concept of civilization has previously been discussed in close connection with the discourse of the nation-state as one of the characteristics of modernity, but this study confirms that the concept of civilization is also inextricably related to the establishment of the modern economic field. Also, in 1909 and 1910, among the terms that formed a significant relationship with civilization, many were identified which relate to literature and art. This shows the relationship between the liberal arts, cultivated discourse and civilization, due to the functional division of society and the entanglement of human relationships."

We used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA), an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to extract the latent topics from the large quantity of research abstracts. 20 topics are identified without any prior human judgement. The topics reveal topographical maps of research in international trade and are representative and meaningful in the sense that most of them correspond to previously established sub-topics in trade studies. Then we conducted a regression analysis on the document-topic distributions generated by LDA to identify hot and cold topics. We discovered 2 hot topics(internationalization capacity and performance of export companies, economic effect of trade) and 2 cold topics(exchange rate and current account, trade finance). Trade studies are characterized as a interdisciplinary study of three agendas(i.e. international economy, International Business, trade practice), and 20 topics identified can be grouped into these 3 agendas. From the estimated results of the study, we find that the Korean government’s active pursuit of FTA and consequent necessity of capacity building in Korean export firms lie behind the popularity of topic selection by the Korean researchers in the area of int’l trade."

To understand the structure of data, cluster analysis is often used for nodes obtained from SOM. In cluster analysis, the optimal number of clusters is one of important issues. To help to determine it, various cluster validity indexes have been developed and they can be applied to clustering outcomes for nodes from SOM. However, while SOM has an advantage in that it reflects the topological properties of original data in the low-dimensional space, these indexes do not consider it. Thus, we propose a new cluster validity index for SOM based on connectivity between nodes which considers topological properties of data. The performance of the proposed index is evaluated through simulations and it is compared with various existing cluster validity indexes."

A methodology for evaluating human operator's fitness for duty in nuclear power plants,2020,"['Fatigue', 'Eye tracking', 'Fitness for duty (FFD)']",,"It is reported that about 20% of accidents at nuclear power plants in Korea and abroad are caused by human error. One of the main factors contributing to human error is fatigue, so it is necessary to prevent human errors that may occur when the task is performed in an improper state by grasping the status of the operator in advance. In this study, we propose a method of evaluating operator's fitness-for-duty (FFD) using various parameters including eye movement data, subjective fatigue ratings, and operator's performance. Parameters for evaluating FFD were selected through a literature survey. We performed experiments that test subjects who felt various levels of fatigue monitor information of indicators and diagnose a system malfunction. In order to find meaningful characteristics in measured data consisting of various parameters, hierarchical clustering analysis, an unsupervised machine-learning technique, is used. The characteristics of each cluster were analyzed; fitness-for-duty of each cluster was evaluated. The appropriateness of the number of clusters obtained through clustering analysis was evaluated using both the Elbow and Silhouette methods. Finally, it was statistically shown that the suggested methodology for evaluating FFD does not generate additional fatigue in subjects. Relevance to industry: The methodology for evaluating an operator's fitness for duty in advance is proposed, and it can prevent human errors that might be caused by inappropriate condition in nuclear industries."
