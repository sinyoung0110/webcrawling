행정-정책 의사결정에서 머신러닝(machine learning) 방법론 도입의 정책적 함의: 기계의 한계와 증거기반 의사결정(evidence-based decision-making),2020,"['machine learning', 'evidence-based decision-making', 'rational model of decision-making', '머신러닝', '증거기반 의사결정', '합리적 의사결정']","머신러닝과 딥러닝 등 인공지능 기술의 급속한 발전은 행정-정책 분야에도 영향을 확대하고 있다. 이 연구는 전통적 행정-정책 의사결정 모형인 합리적 모형의 이론적 이상과 현실적 한계에 대한 검토를 바탕으로 최근 연구가 활발히 진행중인 머신러닝 기반 의사결정 사례를 행정-정책 의사결정 관점에서 분석함으로써 인공지능 기술의 행정-정책 분야 도입이 가져올 변화를 논의하고 다음과 같은 두 가지 함의를 도출하였다. 첫째, 분석 대상과 목표가 사전에 잘 수립된 구조화된 문제(structured problems)에서는 기계가 인간의 의사결정에 비해 훨씬 나은 성과를 보이는 것으로 나타나 합리적 의사결정의 구현 가능성이 높아지고 있다. 둘째, 미래를 위한 전략적 의사결정이나 지금까지 경험하지 못한 새로운 환경 변화에 대한 대처 등 기계가 학습할 데이터가 부족하거나 목표가 모호한 비구조화된 문제(unstructured problems)의 경우 인간의 메타(meta) 의사결정이 여전히 중요하다. 따라서 머신러닝 등 인공지능 기술을 행정-정책분야에 성공적으로 도입하려면 다음과 같은 세 가지 사항을 고려해야 한다. 첫째, 해당 분야가 머신러닝으로 구현해도 될 구조화된 문제 영역인지 혹은 인간의 판단이 필수적인 메타(meta) 의사결정 영역인지에 대한 구분이 선행해야 한다. 둘째, 구조화된 문제 영역으로 판단될 경우에도 어떠한 행정-정책 기준(예: 책임성, 효과성, 효율성)으로 알고리즘을 구현할 것인지에 대한 인간의 메타 의사결정이 필요하다. 셋째, 메타 의사결정의 질을 향상하기 위해 의사결정자는 일화적 경험(anecdotal experience)에 의존하는 대신 체계적(systematic)인 의사결정을 내릴 수 있도록 증거기반 의사결정(evidence-based decision-making)을 이해하고 실천해야 한다.","The present study explores the policy implications of the introduction of machine learning into public administration. We first briefly overview the theoretical implications and practical limitations of a rational decision-making perspective, focusing on its unrealistic assumptions. We then discuss the capability of machine learning–based decision-making that may overcome the limitations of human decision-making by reviewing recent research comparing the decision performance of machine learning algorithms with human decisions in the context of crowdlending. Our findings demonstrate that machine learning algorithms may outperform human decisions in structured problems, whereas human decisions are critical in unstructured problems such as meta-decisions(e.g., what to decide and how to decide). We draw three policy implications for the introduction of machine learning into public administration. First, public administrators and policymakers should determine the nature of the decision task; i.e., whether it is a structured problem or an unstructured problem that may require meta-decisions. Second, meta-decisions regarding the decision criteria (e.g., accountability, effectiveness) are required for machine learning algorithms aiming to resolve structured problems. Third, public administrators and policymakers should develop the ability and skills to implement evidence-based decision-making in order to make a high-quality meta-decision for unstructured problems."

Machine Learning기법을 이용한 Robot 이상 예지 보전,2020,"['Machine Learning', 'MT(Mahalanobis Taguchi)', 'MD(Mahalanobis Distance)', 'Predictive Maintenance']",,"In this paper, a predictive maintenance of the robot trouble using the machine learning method, so called MT(Mahalanobis Taguchi), was studied. Especially, 'MD(Mahalanobis Distance)' was used to compare the robot arm motion difference between before the maintenance(bearing change) and after the maintenance. 6-axies vibration sensor was used to detect the vibration sensing during the motion of the robot arm. The results of the comparison, MD value of the arm motions of the after the maintenance(bearing change) was much lower and stable compared to MD value of the arm motions of the before the maintenance. MD value well distinguished the fine difference of the arm vibration of the robot. The superior performance of the MT method applied to the prediction of the robot trouble was verified by this experiments."
A Nature-inspired Multiple Kernel Extreme Learning Machine Model for Intrusion Detection,2020,"['Meta-heuristics', 'Kernel extreme learning machine', 'Multiple kernel learning', 'Intrusion detection']",,"The application of machine learning (ML) in intrusion detection has attracted much attention with the rapid growth of information security threat. As an efficient multi-label classifier, kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) has been gradually used in intrusion detection system. However, the performance of KELM heavily relies on the kernel selection. In this paper, a novel multiple kernel extreme learning machine (MKELM) model combining the ReliefF with nature-inspired methods is proposed for intrusion detection. The MKELM is designed to estimate whether the attack is carried out and the ReliefF is used as a preprocessor of MKELM to select appropriate features. In addition, the nature-inspired methods whose fitness functions are defined based on the kernel alignment are employed to build the optimal composite kernel in the MKELM. The KDD99, NSL and Kyoto datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the model. The experimental results indicate that the optimal composite kernel function can be determined by using any heuristic optimization method, including PSO, GA, GWO, BA and DE. Since the filter-based feature selection method is combined with the multiple kernel learning approach independent of the classifier, the proposed model can have a good performance while saving a lot of training time."
Enhancing the Reliability of Wi-Fi Network Using Evil Twin AP Detection Method Based on Machine Learning,2020,"['Access Point', 'Classification Algorithm', 'Clock Skew', 'Evil Twin AP', 'Rogue AP', 'Wireless Network']",,"Wireless networks have become integral to society as they provide mobility and scalability advantages. However, their disadvantage is that they cannot control the media, which makes them vulnerable to various types of attacks. One example of such attacks is the evil twin access point (AP) attack, in which an authorized AP is impersonated by mimicking its service set identifier (SSID) and media access control (MAC) address. Evil twin APs are a major source of deception in wireless networks, facilitating message forgery and eavesdropping. Hence, it is necessary to detect them rapidly. To this end, numerous methods using clock skew have been proposed for evil twin AP detection. However, clock skew is difficult to calculate precisely because wireless networks are vulnerable to noise. This paper proposes an evil twin AP detection method that uses a multiple-feature-based machine learning classification algorithm. The features used in the proposed method are clock skew, channel, received signal strength, and duration. The results of experiments conducted indicate that the proposed method has an evil twin AP detection accuracy of 100% using the random forest algorithm."
The Prototype Development Applied as a Conceptual Design of an Automated Machine Learning System,2020,"['automated machine learning', 'AutoML', '인공지능', '머신러닝', '프로토타입', 'artificial intelligence', 'machine learning', 'prototype']","이 논문에서는 오픈소스기반의 자동화된 머신러닝시스템의 개념을 제안한다. 최근에 글로벌 소프트웨어 기업들이 쉽게 실행할 수 있는 자동화 머신러닝시스템을 개발하여 개발비용을 절감시키고 있다. 그러나 완전 자동화 머신러닝시스템은 아직 개발되지 않았다. 그리고 현존하는 자동화 머신러닝시스템은 반자동시스템으로 특정분야에 한정되어 적용되고 있다. 그러므로, 이 연구에서는 변수선택, 분석모델선택과 하이퍼파라미터튜닝의 전체 과정을 자동화시킬 수 있는 개념적 디자인이 적용된 프로토타입을 제안하고자 한다. 추가로 제안하는 프로토타입의 가능성을 가늠해 보기 위해, 실제 주식시장(KOSPI)의 종목을 선택하여 주가를 예측하는 파일럿테스트를 진행하였다. 향후에 이러한 개념은 자체적인 머신러닝시스템을 개발할 여력이 없는 중소기업에 크게 도움을 줄 것으로 기대한다. 더불어서 이 개념이 머신러닝에 대한 대중의 접근성을 향상시켜 머신러닝 대중화에 기여할 것으로 기대한다.","In this paper, we propose the concept of a fully automated machine learning system based on an open-source. In recent years, automated machine learning systems have been developed by global software companies that can easily perform machine learning analysis while reducing the cost of developing the machine learning system. However, fully automated machine learning has not been developed. Additionally, existing systems are limited to specific fields. In this paper, we proposed a prototype that can automate the whole process of variable selection, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. Also, to check the possibility that the prototype works reliably in real-market applications, we conducted stock price prediction pilot tests using the KOSPI stocks. In the near future, the concept can be applied to a variety of applications and will be of major benefit to small and medium-sized enterprises that cannot develop their data analysis models because of high development costs. Also, it is expected that this concept will improve accessibility to machine learning technology and contribute to the popularization of machine learning."
Novel Method of Classification in Knee Osteoarthritis: Machine Learning Application Versus Logistic Regression Model,2020,"['.', 'Knee osteoarthritis', 'Gait analysis', 'Knee joint', 'Severity', 'Machine learning']",,"Objective To present new classification methods of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) using machine learning and compare its performance with conventional statistical methods as classification techniques using machine learning have recently been developed.Methods A total of 84 KOA patients and 97 normal participants were recruited. KOA patients were clustered into three groups according to the Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L) grading system. All subjects completed gait trials under the same experimental conditions. Machine learning-based classification using the support vector machine (SVM) classifier was performed to classify KOA patients and the severity of KOA. Logistic regression analysis was also performed to compare the results in classifying KOA patients with machine learning method.Results In the classification between KOA patients and normal subjects, the accuracy of classification was higher in machine learning method than in logistic regression analysis. In the classification of KOA severity, accuracy was enhanced through the feature selection process in the machine learning method. The most significant gait feature for classification was flexion and extension of the knee in the swing phase in the machine learning method.Conclusion The machine learning method is thought to be a new approach to complement conventional logistic regression analysis in the classification of KOA patients. It can be clinically used for diagnosis and gait correction of KOA patients."

Consequently, technologies related to data analysis are growing in importance. The shipbuilding industry has high production uncertainty and variability, which has created an urgent need for data analysis techniques, such as machine learning. In particular, the industry cannot effectively respond to changes in the production-related standard time information systems, such as the basic cycle time and lead time. Improvement measures are necessary to enable the industry to respond swiftly to changes in the production environment. In this study, the lead times for fabrication, assembly of ship block, spool fabrication and painting were predicted using machine learning technology to propose a new management method for the process lead time using a master data system for the time element in the production data. Data preprocessing was performed in various ways using R and Python, which are open source programming languages, and process variables were selected considering their relationships with the lead time through correlation analysis and analysis of variables. Various machine learning, deep learning, and ensemble learning algorithms were applied to create the lead time prediction models. In addition, the applicability of the proposed machine learning methodology to standard work hour prediction was verified by evaluating the prediction models using the evaluation criteria, such as the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE)."

Prediction of Suicidal Ideation among Korean Adults Using Machine Learning: A Cross-Sectional Study,2020,"['Suicidal ideation', 'Risk factor', 'Machine learning', 'Artificial intelligence']",,"Objective Suicidal ideation (SI) precedes actual suicidal event. Thus, it is important for the prevention of suicide to screen the individuals with SI. This study aimed to identify the factors associated with SI and to build prediction models in Korean adults using machine learning methods. Methods The 2010–2013 dataset of the Korea National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey was used as the training dataset (n=16,437), and the subset collected in 2015 was used as the testing dataset (n=3,788). Various machine learning algorithms were applied and compared to the conventional logistic regression (LR)-based model. Results Common risk factors for SI included stress awareness, experience of continuous depressive mood, EQ-5D score, depressive disorder, household income, educational status, alcohol abuse, and unmet medical service needs. The prediction performances of the machine learning models, as measured by the area under receiver-operating curve, ranged from 0.794 to 0.877, some of which were better than that of the conventional LR model (0.867). The Bayesian network, LogitBoost with LR, and ANN models outperformed the conventional LR model. Conclusion A machine learning-based approach could provide better SI prediction performance compared to a conventional LRbased model. These may help primary care physicians to identify patients at risk of SI and will facilitate the early prevention of suicide."

A machine-learning expert-supporting system for diagnosis prediction of lymphoid neoplasms using a probabilistic decision-tree algorithm and immunohistochemistry profile database,2020,"['Database', 'Expert-supporting system', 'Machine learning', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Probabilistic decision tree']",,"Background: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) has played an essential role in the diagnosis of hematolymphoid neoplasms. However, IHC interpretations can be challenging in daily practice, and exponentially expanding volumes of IHC data are making the task increasingly difficult. We therefore developed a machine-learning expert-supporting system for diagnosing lymphoid neoplasms. Methods: A probabilistic decision-tree algorithm based on the Bayesian theorem was used to develop mobile application software for iOS and Android platforms. We tested the software with real data from 602 training and 392 validation cases of lymphoid neoplasms and compared the precision hit rates between the training and validation datasets. Results: IHC expression data for 150 lymphoid neoplasms and 584 antibodies was gathered. The precision hit rates of 94.7% in the training data and 95.7% in the validation data for lymphomas were not statistically significant. Results in most B-cell lymphomas were excellent, and generally equivalent performance was seen in T-cell lymphomas. The primary reasons for lack of precision were atypical IHC profiles for certain cases (e.g., CD15-negative Hodgkin lymphoma), a lack of disease-specific markers, and overlapping IHC profiles of similar diseases. Conclusions: Application of the machine-learning algorithm to diagnosis precision produced acceptable hit rates in training and validation datasets. Because of the lack of origin- or disease-specific markers in differential diagnosis, contextual information such as clinical and histological features should be taken into account to make proper use of this system in the pathologic decision-making process."
Predicting 30-day mortality of patients with pneumonia in an emergency department setting using machine-learning models,2020,"['Pneumonia', 'Machine-learning', 'Mortality', 'Emergency service', 'hospital']",,"Objective This study aimed to confirm the accuracy of a machine-learning-based model in predicting the 30-day mortality of patients with pneumonia and evaluating whether they were required to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods The study conducted a retrospective analysis of pneumonia patients at an emergency department (ED) in Seoul, Korea, from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2017. Patients aged 18 years or older with a pneumonia registry designation on their electronic medical record were enrolled. We collected their demographic information, mental status, and laboratory findings. Three models were used: the pre-existing CURB-65 model, and the CURB-RF and Extensive CURB-RF models, which were machine-learning models that used a random forest algorithm. The primary outcomes were ICU admission from the ED or 30-day mortality. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed for the models, and the areas under these curves were compared. Results Out of the 1,974 pneumonia patients, 1,732 patients were eligible to be included in the study; from these, 473 patients died within 30 days or were initially admitted to the ICU from the ED. The area under receiver operating characteristic curves of CURB-65, CURB-RF, and extensive-CURB-RF were 0.615 (0.614–0.616), 0.701 (0.700–0.702), and 0.844 (0.843–0.845), respectively. Conclusion The proposed machine-learning models could predict the mortality of patients with pneumonia more accurately than the pre-existing CURB-65 model and can help decide whether the patient should be admitted to the ICU."
Heart-Rate-Based Machine-Learning Algorithms for Screening Orthostatic Hypotension,2020,"['orthostatic hypotension', 'heart rate', 'Valsalva maneuver', 'machine learning']",,"Background and Purpose Many elderly patients are unable to actively stand up by themselves and have contraindications to performing the head-up tilt test (HUTT). We aimed to develop screening algorithms for diagnosing orthostatic hypotension (OH) before performing the HUTT.Methods This study recruited 663 patients with orthostatic intolerance (78 with and 585 without OH, as confirmed by the HUTT) and compared their clinical characteristics. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to investigate potential predictors of an OH diagnosis. Machine-learning algorithms were applied to determine whether the accuracy of OH prediction could be used for screening OH without performing the HUTT.Results Differences between expiration and inspiration (E-I differences), expiration:inspiration ratios (E:I ratios), and Valsalva ratios were smaller in patients with OH than in those without OH. The univariate analysis showed that increased age and baseline systolic blood pressure (BP) as well as decreased E-I difference, E:I ratio, and Valsalva ratio were correlated with OH. In the multivariate analysis, increased baseline systolic BP and decreased Valsalva ratio were found to be independent predictors of OH. Using those variables as input features, the classification accuracies of the support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest methods were 84.4%, 84.4%, and 90.6%, respectively.Conclusions We have identified clinical parameters that are strongly associated with OH. Machine- learning analysis using those parameters was highly accurate in differentiating OH from non-OH patients. These parameters could be useful screening factors for OH in patients who are unable to perform the HUTT."

Prediction of the Emotion Responses to Poster Designs based on Graphical Features: A Machine learning-driven Approach,2020,"['Graphic Design', 'Machine Learning', 'Image Features', 'PAD Theory', 'Color', 'Layout', 'Emotion']",,"Background : Advances in data science have allowed us to investigate human emotions based on the learning of the data set, with current technology enabling us to research the relationship between the form elements of graphic images and human emotional responses. However, to date, studies have been limited to photography, meaning that the practice of graphic design remains unexplored.Methods : We used a design workshop to exploit graphic elements that are perceptually relevant. By identifying and quantifying the elements of each image (N = 320), we were able to define the machine learning features. We collected emotion assessments relating to the images with regard to pleasure, arousal, and dominance using a Likert scale, and combined them with the features to build a dataset. The assessments were carried out twice to form a baseline of accuracy. Applying machine learning methods such as kknn, svmRadial, and C5.0, we modeled algorithms that predict individuals’ emotional assessments of specific aspects.Results : Human assessments were repeatedly in the range of 62.81–80.93%, and a prediction accuracy between 52.26–80.32% was achieved. In particular, the prediction accuracy of pleasure and dominance aspects was relatively high across all individuals.Conclusions : This study demonstrates the use of machine learning-driven algorithm modeling to predict assessments of emotion based on graphical elements of movie posters. Overall, predictions of pleasure and dominance aspects showed higher accuracy than those of the arousal aspect. Limitations and further investigations are discussed to obtain not only a more accurate but also a more insightful estimation."
Application of machine learning to ultrasound images to differentiate follicular neoplasms of the thyroid gland,2020,"['Follicular neoplasm', 'Ultrasonography', 'Machine learning', 'Artificial neural network', 'Support vector machine']",,"Purpose: This study was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic performance of machine learning in differentiating follicular adenoma from carcinoma using preoperative ultrasonography (US).Methods: In this retrospective study, preoperative US images of 348 nodules from 340 patients were collected from two tertiary referral hospitals. Two experienced radiologists independently reviewed each image and categorized the nodules according to the 2015 American Thyroid Association guideline. Categorization of a nodule as highly suspicious was considered a positive diagnosis for malignancy. The nodules were manually segmented, and 96 radiomic features were extracted from each region of interest. Ten significant features were selected and used as final input variables in our in-house developed classifier models based on an artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). The diagnostic performance of radiologists and both classifier models was calculated and compared.Results: In total, 252 nodules from 245 patients were confirmed as follicular adenoma and 96 nodules from 95 patients were diagnosed as follicular carcinoma. As measures of diagnostic performance, the average sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the two experienced radiologists in discriminating follicular adenoma from carcinoma on preoperative US images were 24.0%, 84.0%, and 64.8%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the ANN and SVM�based models were 32.3%, 90.1%, and 74.1% and 41.7%, 79.4%, and 69.0%, respectively.The kappa value of the two radiologists was 0.076, corresponding to slight agreement.Conclusion: Machine learning-based classifier models may aid in discriminating follicular adenoma from carcinoma using preoperative US."
Statistical and Machine Learning-Based FHB Detection in Durum Wheat,2020,"['Fusarium head blight', 'Durum wheat', 'Plant pathology', 'Machine learning', 'Deep learning', 'Support vector machine']",,"Pathogens are the major causes of wheat crop yield losses, including the fungus Fusarium graminearum, an agent of Fusarium Head Blight (FHB). A better understanding of the relationship between plant morphological and biochemical traits and resistance to FHB can be effective in implementing a successful breeding program. This study investigated the relationship between FHB resistance as well as the morphological and biochemical traits in 20 durum wheat lines. Both morphological and biochemical traits were investigated using statistical tools. Therefore, analyses of variance, mean, as well as the correlation between the traits were considered.In addition, for the morphological traits, cluster analyses were performed to identify similar genotypes in control and infected conditions.

Development of a Machine-Learning based Human Activity Recognition System including Eastern-Asian Specific Activities,2020,"['Human Activity Recognition', 'Smartwatch', 'Accelerometer', 'Machine Learning', 'Activity Classification', 'Feature Extraction', 'Feature Reduction']",,"The purpose of this study is to develop a human activity recognition (HAR) system, which distinguishes 13 activities, including five activities commonly dealt with in conventional HAR researches and eight activities from the Eastern-Asian culture. The eight special activities include floor-sitting/standing, chair-sitting/standing, floor-lying/up, and bed-lying/up. We used a 3-axis accelerometer sensor on the wrist for data collection and designed a machine learning model for the activity classification. Data clustering through preprocessing and feature extraction/reduction is performed. We then tested six machine learning algorithms for recognition accuracy comparison. As a result, we have achieved an average accuracy of 99.7% for the 13 activities. This result is far better than the average accuracy of current HAR researches based on a smartwatch (89.4%). The superiority of the HAR system developed in this study is proven because we have achieved 98.7% accuracy with publically available 'pamap2' dataset of 12 activities, whose conventionally met the best accuracy is 96.6%."
A Novel Tool (Single-Flute) Condition Monitoring Method for End Milling Process Based on Intelligent Processing of Milling Force Data by Machine Learning Algorithms,2020,['Cutting force simulation · Manifold learning · Polynomial kernel SVM · Principal component analysis (PCA) · Tool condition monitoring (TCM)'],,"Tool condition monitoring is deemed as an essential technology of the intelligent manufacturing. Tool wear which directly affects the tool life makes a negative influence on the quality and dimensional accuracy of the machined surface, even leads to tool breakage, machine downtime, and other severe problems. Therefore, an available tool condition monitoring system is essential for the machining process to guarantee the processing quality and improve the machining efficiency. This paper proposes a new tool condition monitoring method based on the general judgment of cutting force. Milling force from a single-flute is predicted by deducing a theoretical formula based on un-deformed chip thickness. Based on the formula, cutting force samples used for machine learning paradigms are generated through time domain translation and Gaussian distribution. Nonlinear manifold learning methods are applied in the visualization of high dimensional data. Principal component analysis as a practical feature extraction method is used to reduce the large dimensionality of the sample set. The performance of respectively linear kernel, polynomial kernel, radial basis function and sigmoid kernel are self-compared to estimate the classification results via support vector machine. Experiments are carried out on an annealed Ti–6Al–4V alloy to measure the feasibility of this method."

When the scheme is applied, an optimal k value determination is one of difficult problems to be resolved because many factors should be considered. Currently, the determination has been done almost manually by human experts with their intuition. This leads to degrade performance of the anonymization, and it takes much time and cost for them to do a task. To overcome this problem, a simple idea has been proposed that is based on machine learning. This paper describes implementations and experiments to realize the proposed idea. In thi work, a deep neural network (DNN) is implemented using tensorflow libraries, and it is trained and tested using input dataset. The experiment results show that a trend of training errors follows a typical pattern in DNN, but for validation errors, our model represents a different pattern from one shown in typical training process. The advantage of the proposed approach is that it can reduce time and cost for experts to determine k value because it can be done semi-automatically."

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. According to WHO(World Health Organization)’s situation report published on May 18th, 2020, COVID-19 has already affected 4,600,000 cases and 310,000 deaths globally and still increasing. The most severe problem of COVID-19 virus is that it spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, which occurs in everyday life. And also, at this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. Because of the secure diffusion method and the absence of a vaccine, it is essential to self-diagnose or do a self-diagnosis questionnaire whenever possible. But self-diagnosing has too many questions, and ambiguous standards also take time. Therefore, in this study, using SVM (Support Vector Machine), Decision Tree and correlation analysis found two vital factors to predict the infection of the COVID-19 virus with an accuracy of 80%. Applying the result proposed in this paper, people can self-diagnose quickly to prevent COVID-19 and further prevent the spread of COVID-19."

A Framework of Using Machine Learning Approaches for Short‑Term Solar Power Forecasting,2020,['Short-term solar power forecasting · Machine learning · Feature selection'],,"Various machine learning approaches are widely applied for short-term solar power forecasting, which is highly demanded for renewable energy integration and power system planning. However, appropriate selection of machine learning models and data features is a signifcant challenge. In this study, a framework is developed to quantitatively evaluate various models and feature selection methods, and the best combination for short-term solar power forecasting is discovered. More specifcally, the machine learning methods include the random forest, artifcial neural network and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and the feature selection techniques include the feature importance and principle component analysis (PCA). All possible combinations of these machine learning and feature selection methods are developed and evaluated for solar power forecasting. The best ensemble of machine learning methods and feature selection techniques is identifed for solar power forecasting in Hawaii, US. Simulation results show that the XGBoost method with features selected by the PCA method outperforms the other approaches. In addition, the random forest and XGBoost models have rarely been used for short-term solar forecasting. This framework can be used to select appropriate machine learning approaches for short-term solar power forecasting and the simulation results can be used as a baseline for comparison."

Machine Learning Models for Predicting Hearing Prognosis in Unilateral Idiopathic Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss,2020,"['Sudden Hearing Loss', 'Machine Learning', 'Prognosis', 'Prediction']",,"Objectives. Prognosticating idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) is an important challenge. In our study, a dataset was split into training and test sets and cross-validation was implemented on the training set, thereby determining the hyperparameters for machine learning models with high test accuracy and low bias. The effectiveness of the following five machine learning models for predicting the hearing prognosis in patients with ISSNHL after 1 month of treatment was assessed: adaptive boosting, K-nearest neighbor, multilayer perceptron, random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM).Methods. The medical records of 523 patients with ISSNHL admitted to Korea University Ansan Hospital between January 2010 and October 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. In this study, we analyzed data from 227 patients (recovery, 106; no recovery, 121) after excluding those with missing data. To determine risk factors, statistical hypothesis tests (e.g., the two-sample t-test for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables) were conducted to compare patients who did or did not recover. Variables were selected using an RF model depending on two criteria (mean decreases in the Gini index and accuracy).Results. The SVM model using selected predictors achieved both the highest accuracy (75.36%) and the highest F-score (0.74) on the test set. The RF model with selected variables demonstrated the second-highest accuracy (73.91%) and F-score (0.74). The RF model with the original variables showed the same accuracy (73.91%) as that of the RF model with selected variables, but a lower F-score (0.73). All the tested models, except RF, demonstrated better performance after variable selection based on RF.Conclusion. The SVM model with selected predictors was the best-performing of the tested prediction models. The RF model with selected predictors was the second-best model. Therefore, machine learning models can be used to predict hearing recovery in patients with ISSNHL."

Development of a Wearable Inertial Sensor-based Gait Analysis Device Using Machine Learning Algorithms -Validity of the Temporal Gait Parameter in Healthy Young Adults,2020,"['Gait', 'Machine learning', 'Wearable electronic devices', 'Motion']",,"Purpose: The study aims were to develop a wearable inertial sensor-based gait analysis device that uses machine learning algorithms, and to validate this novel device using temporal gait parameters. Methods: Thirty-four healthy young participants (22 male, 12 female, aged 25.76 years) with no musculoskeletal disorders were asked to walk at three different speeds. As they walked, data were simultaneously collected by a motion capture system and inertial measurement units (Reseed®). The data were sent to a machine learning algorithm adapted to the wearable inertial sensor-based gait analysis device. The validity of the newly developed instrument was assessed by comparing it to data from the motion capture system. Results: At normal speeds, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) for the temporal gait parameters were excellent (ICC [2, 1], 0.99∼0.99), and coefficient of variation (CV) error values were insignificant for all gait parameters (0.31∼1.08%). At slow speeds, ICCs for the temporal gait parameters were excellent (ICC [2, 1], 0.98∼0.99), and CV error values were very small for all gait parameters (0.33∼1.24%). At the fastest speeds, ICCs for temporal gait parameters were excellent (ICC [2, 1], 0.86∼0.99) but less impressive than for the other speeds. CV error values were small for all gait parameters (0.17∼5.58%). Conclusion: These results confirm that both the wearable inertial sensor-based gait analysis device and the machine learning algorithms have strong concurrent validity for temporal variables. On that basis, this novel wearable device is likely to prove useful for establishing temporal gait parameters while assessing gait."

Smart Thermostat based on Machine Learning and Rule Engine,2020,"['Thermostat', 'Machine Learning', 'Rule Engine', 'Data Mining', 'LSTM', 'K-means Clustering']",,"In this paper, we propose a smart thermostat temperature set-point control method based on machine learning and rule engine, which controls thermostat’s temperature set-point so that it can achieve energy savings as much as possible without sacrifice of occupants’ comfort while users’ preference usage pattern is respected. First, the proposed method periodically mines data about how user likes for heating (winter)/cooling (summer) his or her home by learning his or her usage pattern of setting temperature set-point of the thermostat during the past several weeks. Then, from this learning, the proposed method establishes a weekly schedule about temperature setting. Next, by referring to thermal comfort chart by ASHRAE, it makes rules about how to adjust temperature set-points as much as low (winter) or high (summer) while the newly adjusted temperature set-point satisfies thermal comfort zone for predicted humidity. In order to make rules work on time or events, we adopt rule engine so that it can achieve energy savings properly without sacrifice of occupants’ comfort. Through experiments, it is shown that the proposed smart thermostat temperature set-point control method can achieve better energy savings while keeping human comfort compared to other conventional thermostat."
Damage detection in truss bridges using transmissibility and machine learning algorithm: Application to Nam O bridge,2020,"['transmissibility', 'machine learning algorithm', 'Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)', 'Structural Health Monitoring (SHM)', 'large-scale truss bridge']",,"This paper proposes the use of transmissibility functions combined with a machine learning algorithm, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), to assess damage in a truss bridge. A new approach method, which makes use of the input parameters calculated from the transmissibility function, is proposed. The network not only can predict the existence of damage, but also can classify the damage types and identity the location of the damage. Sensors are installed in the truss joints in order to measure the bridge vibration responses under train and ambient excitations. A finite element (FE) model is constructed for the bridge and updated using FE software and experimental data. Both single damage and multiple damage cases are simulated in the bridge model with different scenarios. In each scenario, the vibration responses at the considered nodes are recorded and then used to calculate the transmissibility functions. The transmissibility damage indicators are calculated and stored as ANNs inputs. The outputs of the ANNs are the damage type, location and severity. Two machine learning algorithms are used; one for classifying the type and location of damage, whereas the other for finding the severity of damage. The measurements of the Nam O bridge, a truss railway bridge in Vietnam, is used to illustrate the method. The proposed method not only can distinguish the damage type, but also it can accurately identify damage level."
Comparison of machine learning algorithms for regression and classification of ultimate load-carrying capacity of steel frames,2020,"['gradient boosting', 'random forest', 'deep learning', 'support vector machine', 'nonlinear inelastic', 'steel frame']",,"In this paper, the efficiency of five Machine Learning (ML) methods consisting of Deep Learning (DL), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and Gradient Tree Booting (GTB) for regression and classification of the Ultimate Load Factor (ULF) of nonlinear inelastic steel frames is compared. For this purpose, a two-story, a six-story, and a twenty-story space frame are considered. An advanced nonlinear inelastic analysis is carried out for the steel frames to generate datasets for the training of the considered ML methods. In each dataset, the input variables are the geometric features of W-sections and the output variable is the ULF of the frame. The comparison between the five ML methods is made in terms of the mean-squared-error (MSE) for the regression models and the accuracy for the classification models, respectively. Moreover, the ULF distribution curve is calculated for each frame and the strength failure probability is estimated. It is found that the GTB method has the best efficiency in both regression and classification of ULF regardless of the number of training samples and the space frames considered."

Modified Low-Cycle Fatigue Estimation Using Machine Learning for Radius-Cut Coke-Shaped Metallic Damper Subjected to Cyclic Loading,2020,['Plastic hinge · Passive damper · Low-cycle fatigue · Machine learning'],,"In this study, a coke-shaped steel damper that exhibits in-plane resistance is introduced as a passive damper. The double-coke damper presented in this study applies the concept of reduced beam sections to increase the ductility in the case of a prolonged earthquake. Multiplastic hinges are placed on each strip by setting the radius-cut section. The fatigue performance of the damper during earthquake loading is verified through a constant cyclic loading test. The results indicate that, as the number of plastic hinges inside the strip increases, the damper ductility increases, producing a stable hysteresis graph. In addition, a new equation that considers the damage index using parameters such as maximum strength and effective stiffness is proposed, and the experimental results are found to be in excellent agreement with the number of failure cycles obtained from the proposed model. By comparing the results of applying the proposed equation with the machine learning results, it is demonstrated that machine learning can be used for estimating the damper performance against the fatigue of the resistive cycle."
Prediction of Chronic Disease-Related Inpatient Prolonged Length of Stay Using Machine Learning Algorithms,2020,"['Length of Stay', 'Chronic Disease', 'Inpatients', 'Machine Learning', 'Discharge Planning']",,"Objectives: The study aimed to develop and compare predictive models based on supervised machine learning algorithms for predicting the prolonged length of stay (LOS) of hospitalized patients diagnosed with five different chronic conditions.Methods: An administrative claim dataset (2008–2012) of a regional network of nine hospitals in the Tampa Bay area, Florida, USA, was used to develop the prediction models. Features were extracted from the dataset using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Five learning algorithms, namely, decision tree C5.0, linear support vector machine (LSVM), k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and multi-layered artificial neural networks, were used to build the model with semi-supervised anomaly detection and two feature selection methods. Issues with the unbalanced nature of the dataset were resolved using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). Results:LSVM with wrapper feature selection performed moderately well for all patient cohorts. Using SMOTE to counter data imbalances triggered a tradeoff between the model’s sensitivity and specificity, which can be masked under a similar area under the curve. The proposed aggregate rank selection approach resulted in a balanced performing model compared to other criteria. Finally, factors such as comorbidity conditions, source of admission, and payer types were associated with the increased risk of a prolonged LOS. Conclusions: Prolonged LOS is mostly associated with pre-intraoperative clinical and patient socio-economic factors. Accurate patient identification with the risk of prolonged LOS using the selected model can provide hospitals a better tool for planning early discharge and resource allocation, thus reducing avoidable hospitalization costs."
Outlier Detection in Indoor Localization and Internet of Things (IoT) using Machine Learning,2020,"['Internet of things', 'localization', 'outliers', 'outliers detection.']",,"In Internet of things (IoT) millions of devices are intelligently connected for providing smart services. Especially in indoor localization environment, that is one of the most concerningtopic of smart cities, internet of things and wireless sensor networks. Many technologies are being used for localization purposein indoor environment and Wi-Fi using received signal strengths(RSSs) is one of them. Wi-Fi RSSs are sensitive to reflection, refraction, interference and channel noise that cause irregularity insignal strengths. The irregular and anomalous RSS values, used ina Wi-Fi indoor localization environment, cannot define the locationof any unknown node correctly. Therefore, this research has developed an outlier detection technique named as iF_Ensemblefor Wi-Fi indoor localization environment by analyzing RSSs using the combination of supervised, unsupervised and ensemble machine learning methods. In this research isolation forest (iForest)is used as an unsupervised learning method. Supervised learningmethod includes support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and random forest (RF) classifiers with stacking thatis an ensemble learning method.

Pipe thinning model development for direct current potential drop data with machine learning approach,2020,"['Flow accelerated corrosion', 'Piping thinning', 'Direct current potential drop', 'Machine learning']",,"The accelerated corrosion by Flow Accelerated Corrosion (FAC) has caused unexpected rupture of piping, hindering the safety of nuclear power plants (NPPs) and sometimes causing personal injury. For the safety, it may be necessary to select some pipes in terms of condition monitoring and to measure the change in thickness of pipes in real time. Direct current potential drop (DCPD) method has advantages in on-line monitoring of pipe wall thinning. However, it has a disadvantage in that it is difficult to quantify thinning due to various thinning shapes and thus there is a limitation in application. The machine learning approach has advantages in that it can be easily applied because the machine can learn the signals of various thinning shapes and can identify the thinning using these. In this paper, finite element analysis (FEA) was performed by applying direct current to a carbon steel pipe and measuring the potential drop. The fundamental machine learning was carried out and the piping thinning model was developed. In this process, the features of DCPD to thinning were proposed."

Machine learning approach for sorting SiC MOSFET devices for paralleling,2020,"['SiC MOSFET', 'Current imbalance', 'Sorting', 'Paralleling', 'Machine learning', 'Multivariate linear regression']",,"This paper presents the development of a machine learning model for sorting SiC MOSFET devices for paralleling. A multivariate linear regression model is developed and trained with device parameter data (as input) and current imbalance data (as label). Each of the training devices is successively paralleled with one reference device to generate the current imbalance (label) data. Devices with close values of current imbalance when individually paralleled with the reference device are expected to have relatively balanced current sharing when paralleled among themselves. This model is trained with 40 devices and tested with 20 devices. The model shows accuracies of 87.93% and 97.48% in predicting transient and steady state current imbalances, respectively. These accuracy values are obtained by comparing the model's prediction for the 20 testing devices with the actual current imbalance values when these devices are paralleled with a reference device. Based on current imbalance predictions made by these models, the devices are grouped into classes for paralleling applications. The selection of devices for paralleling based on predictions from these models result in a satisfactorily balanced current distribution. The model's performance at higher temperatures is also satisfactory."

Applying Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict Potential Energies and Atomic Forces during C-H Activation,2020,"['Machine-learning potential', 'Tree-based algorithm', 'Feature-engineering']",,"Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are useful in understanding the interaction between solid materials and molecules. However, performing MD simulations is possible only when interatomic potentials are available and constructing such interatomic potentials usually requires additional computational work. Recently, generating interatomic potentials was shown to be much easier when machine learning (ML) algorithms were used. In addition, ML algorithms require new descriptors for improved performance. Here, we present an ML approach with several categories of atomic descriptors to predict the parameters necessary for MD simulations, such as the potential energies and the atomic forces. We propose several atomic descriptors based on structural information and find that better descriptors can be generated from eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Moreover, we observe fewer descriptors that perform better in predicting the potential energies and the forces during methane activation processes on a catalytic Pt(111) surface. These results were consistently observed in two different ML algorithms: fully-connected neural network (FNN) and XGBoost. Taking into account the advantages of FNN and XGBoost, we propose an efficient ML model for estimating potential energies. Our findings will be helpful in developing new ML potentials for long-time MD simulations."

Based on this, we compared the prediction performances of LSTM, the Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model (which is a traditional statistical prediction model), and the similar pattern searching method used for long-term prediction. The LSTM model yielded superior results compared to the other techniques in the prediction period starting from the max/min points, but presented inferior results in the prediction period including the inflection points. It was found that efficient learning was not achieved, owing to the lack of currently available learning data in the prediction period including the maximum points. To overcome this, we proposed a method to increase the size of the learning samples using the sunspot data and to upgrade the LSTM model."

Data Science and Machine Learning in Anesthesiology,2020,"['Artificial intelligence', 'Data science', 'Electronic health record', 'Machine learning', 'Predictive analytics', 'Risk score system.']",,"Machine learning (ML) is revolutionizing anesthesiology research. Unlike classical research methods that are largely inference-based, ML is geared more towards making accurate predictions. ML is a field of artificial intelligence concerned with developing algorithms and models to perform prediction tasks in the absence of explicit instructions. Most ML applications, despite being highly variable in the topics that they deal with, generally follow a common workflow. For classification tasks, a researcher typically tests various ML models and compares the predictive performance with the reference logistic regression model. The main advantage of ML lies in its ability to deal with many features with complex interactions and its specific focus on maximizing predictive performance. However, emphasis on data-driven prediction can sometimes neglect mechanistic understanding. This article mainly focuses on the application of supervised ML to electronic health record (EHR) data. The main limitation of EHR-based studies is in the difficulty of establishing causal relationships. However, the associated low cost and rich information content provide great potential to uncover hitherto unknown correlations. In this review, the basic concepts of ML are introduced along with important terms that any ML researcher should know.

We examine the changes in consumers' choice of retailers and their purchasing patterns of agri-food following the implementation of such regulation. Research design, data, and methodology – Household spending patterns were identified through the historical data of household food purchase, consumer panel provided by the Rural Development Administration. Clustering was employed to determine the household spending patterns. Moreover, the different household spending patterns before and after the regulation were comparatively studied. The patterns of consumers' choice of retail stores and shopping baskets by the type of retailers, derived from the respective datasets before and after the regulation, were compared to analyze the effects of the regulation. Results –After the regulation, some consumers who used to shop at large retailers before the regulation changed their shopping places to small retailers. However, the product categories that consumers had mainly purchased before the regulation were rarely changed even after the regulation. Conclusions – Although the regulation helped migrate some of the consumers to small retailers, the regulation seemed to have failed to stimulate consumers to purchase the goods, normally bought at large retailers, from traditional markets. In other words, traditional markets are not effective substitutes for regulation-affected retailers."

In this paper, the structure and the protocols of NWDAFthat are defined in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)standard documents are first described. Then, cell-based syntheticdata set for 5G networks based on the fields defined by the 3GPPspecifications is generated. Further, some anomalies are added tothis data set (e.g., suddenly increasing traffic in a particular cell),and then these anomalies within each cell, subscriber category,and user equipment are classified. Afterward, three ML models,namely, linear regression, long-short term memory, and recursiveneural networks are implemented to study behaviour informationestimation (e.g., anomalies in the network traffic) and network loadprediction capabilities of NWDAF. For the prediction of networkload, three different models are used to minimize the mean absoluteerror, which is calculated by subtracting the actual generated datafrom the model prediction value. For the classification of anomalies, two ML models are used to increase the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, namely, logistic regressionand extreme gradient boosting. According to the simulation results, neural network algorithms outperform linear regression innetwork load prediction, whereas the tree-based gradient boosting algorithm outperforms logistic regression in anomaly detection.These estimations are expected to increase the performance of the5G network through NWDAF."

Despite HPC is a highly complex material, predicting its pattern is a rather ambitious process. Hence, choosing and applying the correct method remain a crucial task. Like some other problems, prediction of HPC slump flow suffers from abnormal attributes which might both have an influence on prediction accuracy and increases variance. In recent years, different studies are proposed to optimize the prediction accuracy for HPC slump flow.However, more state-of-the-art regression algorithms can be implemented to create a better model. This study focuses on several methods with different mathematical backgrounds to get the best possible results. Four well-known algorithms Support Vector Regression, M5P Trees, Random Forest, and MLPReg are implemented with optimum parameters as base learners. Also, redundant features are examined to better understand both how ingredients influence on prediction models and whether possible to achieve acceptable results with a few components.

In this regard, a conceptual framework for the application of digital twin technology for the prognosis of Control Element Drive Mechanism (CEDM), and a data-driven approach to anomaly detection using coil current profile are presented in this study. Health management of plant components can capitalize on the data and signals that are already recorded as part of the monitored parameters of the plant's instrumentation and control systems. This work is focused on the development of machine learning algorithm and workflow for the analysis of the CEDM using the recorded coil current data. The workflow involves features extraction from the coil-current profile and consequently performing both clustering and classification algorithms. This approach provides an opportunity for health monitoring in support of condition-based predictive maintenance optimization and in the development of the CEDM digital twin model for improved plant safety and availability."
Developmental dyslexia detection using machine learning techniques : A survey,2020,['DyslexiaMachine learningSurveyEEG'],,"Developmental dyslexia is a learning disability that occurs mostly in children during their early childhood. Dyslexic children face difficulties while reading, spelling and writing words despite having average or above-average intelligence. As a consequence, dyslexic children often suffer from negative feelings, such as low self-esteem, frustration, and anger. Therefore, early detection of dyslexia is very important to support dyslexic children right from the start. Researchers have proposed a wide range of techniques to detect developmental dyslexia, which includes game-based techniques, reading and writing tests, facial image capture and analysis, eye tracking, Magnetic reasoning imaging (MRI) and Electroencephalography (EEG) scans. This survey paper critically analyzes recent contributions in detecting dyslexia using machine learning techniques and identify potential opportunities for future research."

Real-Time Flood Disaster Prediction System by Applying Machine Learning Technique,2020,"['Urban flood prediction', 'Drainage system', 'Urban inundation model', 'Rainfall-inundation database', 'Artificial neural network (ANN)']",,"As rainfall intensity varies irregularly, urban floods can cause extreme damage. Furthermore, they are extremely nonlinear phenomena that are complex to analyze. Therefore, a classification-based real-time flood prediction model for urban areas is constructed in this study, by combining a numerical analysis model based on hydraulic theory with a machine learning model. Flood databases are constructed in advance for different rainfall scenarios using the Environmental Protection Agency–Storm Water Management Model (EPA-SWMM) and a two-dimensional inundation model. The flood depth data for each map grid are divided into five categories based on the average flood depth using the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and probabilistic neural network (PNN) classification techniques for higher-precision flood range prediction. A model is constructed to predict the representative cumulative volume if the observed rainfall is entered. For spatial expansion of the flood depth with the predicted representative cumulative volume, a system capable of generating a real-time flood map is constructed by linking the cumulative volume of each grid with the representative cumulative volume using linear and nonlinear regression. When compared with the results of a verified two-dimensional (2D) flood model, the developed-model goodness-of-fit is 85%, with a required run time of 1 min 12 s. Using the developed system, rainfall-induced flooding can potentially be predicted, facilitating disaster risk management and minimizing damage to property and health."
SUNSPOT AREA PREDICTION BASED ON COMPLEMENTARY ENSEMBLE EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION AND EXTREME LEARNING MACHINE,2020,"['Sun: sunspots', 'methods: data analysis']",,"The sunspot area is a critical physical quantity for assessing the solar activity level; forecasts of the sunspot area are of great importance for studies of the solar activity and space weather. We developed an innovative hybrid model prediction method by integrating the complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) and extreme learning machine (ELM). The time series is first decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with different frequencies by CEEMD; these IMFs can be divided into three groups, a high-frequency group, a low-frequency group, and a trend group. The ELM forecasting models are established to forecast the three groups separately. The final forecast results are obtained by summing up the forecast values of each group. The proposed hybrid model is applied to the smoothed monthly mean sunspot area archived at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). We find a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.80% and 9.75, respectively, which indicates that: (1) for the CEEMD-ELM model, the predicted sunspot area is in good agreement with the observed one; (2) the proposed model outperforms previous approaches in terms of prediction accuracy and operational efficiency."

Impact of Word Embedding Methods on Performance of Sentiment Analysis with Machine Learning Techniques,2020,"['sentiment analysis', 'Bag of words', 'TF-IDF', 'Word2Vec', 'machine learning', '감성분석', 'Bag of words', 'TF-IDF', 'Word2Vec', '기계 학습']",,"In this study, we propose a comparative study to confirm the impact of various word embedding techniques on the performance of sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is one of opinion mining techniques to identify and extract subjective information from text using natural language processing and can be used to classify the sentiment of product reviews or comments. Since sentiment can be classified as either positive or negative, it can be considered one of the general classification problems. For sentiment analysis, the text must be converted into a language that can be recognized by a computer. Therefore, text such as a word or document is transformed into a vector in natural language processing called word embedding. Various techniques, such as Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec are used as word embedding techniques. Until now, there have not been many studies on word embedding techniques suitable for emotional analysis. In this study, among various word embedding techniques, Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec are used to compare and analyze the performance of movie review sentiment analysis. The research data set for this study is the IMDB data set, which is widely used in text mining. As a result, it was found that the performance of TF-IDF and Bag of Words was superior to that of Word2Vec and TF-IDF performed better than Bag of Words, but the difference was not very significant."

Solenoid valves can be found in so many industries as well as the nuclear plant. The ability to be able to detect the presence of faults and predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of the SOV is important in maintenance planning and also prevent unexpected interruptions in the flow of process fluids. This paper proposes a fault diagnosis method for the alternating current (AC) powered SOV. Previous research work have been focused on direct current (DC) powered SOV where the current waveform or vibrations are monitored. There are many features hidden in the AC waveform that require further signal analysis. The analysis of the AC powered SOV waveform was done in the time and frequency domain. A total of sixteen features were obtained and these were used to classify the different operating modes of the SOV by applying a machine learning technique for classification. Also, a deep neural network (DNN) was developed for the prediction of RUL based on the failure modes of the SOV. The results of this paper can be used to improve on the condition based monitoring of the SOV."

Improving Data Quality of Low-cost IoT Sensors in Environmental Monitoring Networks Using Data Fusion and Machine Learning Approach,2020,['Internet of Things (ioT)Machine learningData fusionFeature selectionEnvironmental monitoring'],,"Environmental monitoring has become an active research area due to the current rise in the global climate change crises. Current environmental monitoring solutions, however, are characterized by high cost of acquisition and complexity of installation; often requiring extensive resources, infrastructure and expertise. It is infeasible to achieve with these solutions, high density in-situ networks such as are required to build refined scale models to facilitate robust monitoring, thus, leaving large gaps within the collected dataset. Low-Cost Sensors (LCS) can offer high-resolution spatiotemporal measurements which could be used to supplement existing dataset from current environmental monitoring solutions. LCS however, require frequent calibration in order to provide accurate and reliable data as they are often affected by environmental conditions when deployed on the field. Calibrating LCS can help to improve their data quality and ensure they are collecting accurate data. Achieving effective calibration, however, requires identifying factors that affect sensor’s data quality for a given measurement. This study evaluates the performance of three Feature Selection (FS) algorithms including Forward Feature Selection (FFS), Backward Elimination (BE) and Exhaustive Feature Selection (EFS) in identifying factors that affect data quality of low-cost IoT sensors in environmental monitoring networks. Applying the concept of data fusion, sensors data were merged with environmental factors and integrated into a single calibration equation to calibrate cairclipO3/NO2 and cairclipNO2 sensors using Linear Regression (LR) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The study showed the effectiveness of calibration in improving low-cost IoT sensor data quality and also demonstrated the convenience of feature selection and the ability of data fusion to provide more consistent, accurate and reliable information for calibration models. The analysis showed that the cairclipO3/NO2 sensor provided measurements that have good correlation with reference measurements whereas the cairclipNO2 sensor showed no reasonable correlation with the reference data. Calibrating the cairclipO3/NO2 yielded good improvement in its measurement outputs when compared to reference measurements (R2=0.83). However, calibrating the cairclipNO2 sensor data yielded no significant improvement in its data quality."

Practical Vitamin D Supplementation Using Machine Learning,2020,['Breast neoplasms · Osteoporosis · Vitamin D'],,"Background: Patients with breast cancer are at increased risk of developing osteoporosis. Maintaining normal levels of vitamin D may decrease the risk of osteoporosis, and vitamin D levels must be corrected in patients who develop osteoporosis before beginning bone modifying agents. Therefore, it is important to correct insufficient vitamin D levels in a timely manner. In clinical practice, current guidelines for replacement regimens often fail to rapidly correct vitamin D levels. The goal of this study was to review data in order to predict what replacement regimen(s) were most effective at repleting vitamin D levels. Methods: For this retrospective cohort study, data was collected from medical records of 2,164 female patients with breast cancer with Institutional Review Board approval. Total level change per week was the primary outcome and was compared for the most commonly used vitamin D replacement regimens adjusted for age, race, body mass index, creatinine clearance, endocrine therapy, and initial level. Results: Higher weekly doses of vitamin D supplementation had a more significant impact on the rate of correction compared to lower daily doses. Generalized linear model was used to develop an online calculator that predicts time to vitamin D level correction adjusted for significant patient characteristics for 5 common replacement regimens as well as no intervention. Conclusions: When choosing a vitamin D replacement regimen for patients with vitamin D deficiency, we recommend clinicians use the online calculator to ensure that the chosen regimen will enable the patient to reach vitamin D sufficiency in a timely manner."

In this research, due to the variety of models, the low accuracy and impact of different parameters, the use of new intelligence methods is considered. Therefore, using artificial intelligent-based models, a new solution for evaluating the bond strength of FRP is presented in this paper. 150 experimental samples were collected from previous studies, and then two new hybrid models of Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA)-Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)-ANN were developed. These models were evaluated using different performance indices and then, a comparison was made between the developed models. The results showed that the ICA-ANN model's ability to predict the bond strength of FRP is higher than the ABC-ANN model. Finally, to demonstrate the capabilities of this new model, a comparison was made between the five experimental models and the results were presented for all data. This comparison showed that the new model could offer better performance.

For about 200 years, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd industrial revolutions were experienced, and the 4th industrial revolution was declared in 2015. Declared to commercialize 5G in 2020. By 2020, it will enter the era of the fourth industrial revolution. Our older generation must live in the midst of the fourth industrial revolution led by young people. From 2015, the era of the 4th industrial revolution, a production system based on cyber physical systems, began. The Internet of Things era is to create a flexible and efficient production system by connecting humans and machines. Convenience, diversity and originality are the most important spirits of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. How can Buddhism contribute to humans seeking convenience through concentration and reflection? Buddhism easily embraces a diversity that acknowledges everything. Buddhists will be able to lead and live the 4th Industrial Revolution easily. The core of the 4th industry is machine and human, but it is based on meditation such as concentration and reflection. The life of Buddhists can be harmonized with the 4th Industrial Revolution and live in harmony with the organization and society. The main core technologies that lead the 4th industrial revolution are physics, digital, and biology. Physics is connected to unmanned transportation, robotics, 3D printing, and new materials. Digital is connected to the Internet of Things and blockchain. Biology is linked to genetics, gene editing, and synthetic biology. The national safety management paradigm is also changing by the 4th industrial revolution. So far, the national safety 1.0 system is the center of disaster acceptance and recovery. Responding to disasters, the national safety 2.0 system is the focus of on-site response. The national safety that prepares for disaster preparedness based on ICT is version 3.0. In the future, it is not a disaster caused by disaster prevention, but rather a disaster that will occur in the future. The future system is to comprehensively manage disaster risk for each process such as prediction, risk assessment, and reduction activities. In terms of our health, it is the same as the 3.0 version of National Safety. Until now, the disease had to appear to treat the disease, but in the future, it will go to a paradigm that prevents the disease and leads a healthy life that does not lead to illness."

Robust URL Phishing Detection Based on Deep Learning,2020,"['Phishing Detection', 'Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning', 'Convolutional Neural Network', 'CNN', 'Cyber Security']",,"Phishing websites can have devastating effects on governmental, financial, and social services, as well as on individual privacy. Currently, many phishing detection solutions are evaluated using small datasets and, thus, are prone to sampling issues, such as representing legitimate websites by only high-ranking websites, which could make their evaluation less relevant in practice. Phishing detection solutions which depend only on the URL are attractive, as they can be used in limited systems, such as with firewalls. In this paper, we present a URL-only phishing detection solution based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The proposed CNN takes the URL as the input, rather than using predetermined features such as URL length. For training and evaluation, we have collected over two million URLs in a massive URL phishing detection (MUPD) dataset. We split MUPD into training, validation and testing datasets. The proposed CNN achieves approximately 96% accuracy on the testing dataset; this accuracy is achieved with URL schemes (such as HTTP and HTTPS) removed from the URL. Our proposed solution achieved better accuracy compared to an existing state-of-the-art URL-only model on a published dataset. Finally, the results of our experiment suggest keeping the CNN up-to-date for better results in practice."

Analysis of Adverse Drug Reactions Identified in Nursing Notes Using Reinforcement Learning,2020,"['Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Electronic Health Records', 'Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning', 'Nursing Records']",,"Objectives: Electronic Health Records (EHRs)-based surveillance systems are being actively developed for detecting adverse drug reactions (ADRs), but this is being hindered by the difficulty of extracting data from unstructured records. This study performed the analysis of ADRs from nursing notes for drug safety surveillance using the temporal difference method in reinforcement learning (TD learning). Methods: Nursing notes of 8,316 patients (4,158 ADR and 4,158 non-ADR cases) admitted to Ajou University Hospital were used for the ADR classification task. A TD(λ) model was used to estimate state values for indicating the ADR risk. For the TD learning, each nursing phrase was encoded into one of seven states, and the state values estimated during training were employed for the subsequent testing phase. We applied logistic regression to the state values from the TD(λ) model for the classification task. Results: The overall accuracy of TD-based logistic regression of 0.63 was comparable to that of two machine-learning methods (0.64 for a naïve Bayes classifier and 0.63 for a support vector machine), while it outperformed two deep learning-based methods (0.58 for a text convolutional neural network and 0.61 for a long short-term memory neural network). Most importantly, it was found that the TD-based method can estimate state values according to the context of nursing phrases. Conclusions: TD learning is a promising approach because it can exploit contextual, time-dependent aspects of the available data and provide an analysis of the severity of ADRs in a fully incremental manner."

Although many existing systems use measurement data to react to network performance changes, it is highly beneficial to perform accurate performance prediction for different systems to support various network functions. Recent advancements in complex statistical algorithms and computational efficiency have made machine-learning ubiquitous for accurate data-based prediction. A robust network performance prediction framework for optimizing performance and resource utilization through a linear discriminant analysis-based prediction approach has been proposed in this paper. Comparison results with different machine-learning techniques on real-world data demonstrate that SLPP provides superior accuracy and computational efficiency for both stationary and mobile user conditions."

Automated Segmentation of Left Ventricular Myocardium on Cardiac Computed Tomography Using Deep Learning,2020,"['Segmentation', 'Left ventricle', 'Deep learning', 'Machine learning', 'Computed tomography']",,"Objective: To evaluate the accuracy of a deep learning-based automated segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) myocardium using cardiac CT.Materials and Methods: To develop a fully automated algorithm, 100 subjects with coronary artery disease were randomly selected as a development set (50 training / 20 validation / 30 internal test). An experienced cardiac radiologist generated the manual segmentation of the development set. The trained model was evaluated using 1000 validation set generated by an experienced technician. Visual assessment was performed to compare the manual and automatic segmentations. In a quantitative analysis, sensitivity and specificity were calculated according to the number of pixels where two three-dimensional masks of the manual and deep learning segmentations overlapped. Similarity indices, such as the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), were used to evaluate the margin of each segmented masks.Results: The sensitivity and specificity of automated segmentation for each segment (1–16 segments) were high (85.5– 100.0%). The DSC was 88.3 ± 6.2%. Among randomly selected 100 cases, all manual segmentation and deep learning masks for visual analysis were classified as very accurate to mostly accurate and there were no inaccurate cases (manual vs. deep learning: very accurate, 31 vs. 53; accurate, 64 vs. 39; mostly accurate, 15 vs. 8). The number of very accurate cases for deep learning masks was greater than that for manually segmented masks.Conclusion: We present deep learning-based automatic segmentation of the LV myocardium and the results are comparable to manual segmentation data with high sensitivity, specificity, and high similarity scores."

Taking the structural temperature monitoring data of Nanjing Dashengguan Yangtze River Bridge as an example, the long short-term memory (LSTM) network-based recovery method for missing structural temperature data is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the prediction results of temperature data using LSTM network, support vector machine (SVM), and wavelet neural network (WNN) are compared to verify the accuracy advantage of LSTM network in predicting time series data (such as structural temperature). Secondly, the application of LSTM network in the recovery of missing structural temperature data is discussed in detail. The results show that: the LSTM network can effectively recover the missing structural temperature data; incorporating more intact sensor data as input will further improve the recovery effect of missing data; selecting the sensor data which has a higher correlation coefficient with the data we want to recover as the input can achieve higher accuracy."

The application areas of DL in radiation oncology include classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, image translation and generation, and image captioning. This article tries to understand what is the potential role of DL and what can be more achieved by utilizing it in radiation oncology. With the advances in DL, various studies contributing to the development of radiation oncology were investigated comprehensively. In this article, the radiation treatment process was divided into six consecutive stages as follows: patient assessment, simulation, target and organs-at-risk segmentation, treatment planning, quality assurance, and beam delivery in terms of workflow. Studies using DL were classified and organized according to each radiation treatment process. State-of-the-art studies were identified, and the clinical utilities of those researches were examined. The DL model could provide faster and more accurate solutions to problems faced by oncologists. While the effect of a data-driven approach on improving the quality of care for cancer patients is evidently clear, implementing these methods will require cultural changes at both the professional and institutional levels.

These findings help to establish the value of using machine translation tools to support academic literacy in English by showing that they contribute to gains in L2 written grammar. Academic writing teachers may consider integrating these tools more into their courses to improve their students’ academic literacy and develop their L2 learning autonomy."
Review on the Usage of Deep Learning Models in Multi-modal Sentiment Analysis,2020,"['Sentiment analysis', 'Deep learning', 'Machine learning', 'Opinion mining']",,"In recent years, Sentiment Analysis is reshaping the business operations of many organizations by monitoring their brand reputation on social media and acquiring insights from customer""s feedback. Sentiment Analysis is one of the classification tools that identifies and extracts the subjective information of a product. This subjective information can be stated in different ways, such as feedback, discussions, blogs, podcasts, and video logs. This type of information generated by the empowered customers is known as user-generated content, which is traditionally in the form of words. The analysis was performed on a huge number of words using Natural Language Processing (NLP), which is a Unimodal Sentiment Analysis. With the rapid growth in the usage of the Internet, social media turned out to be a platform to share the thoughts of the individuals. This caused researchers to migrate from the traditional Unimodal analysis to Multimodal Sentiment Analysis, which includes video, audio, and images. This approach leverages the use of emotion and content and helps identify the scope and polarity of an individual’s sentiment. With the latest deep learning algorithms, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis can solve the problem of sarcasm identification. Multi-Modal Sentiment Analysis generates more accurate results compared to Uni Modal Sentiment Analysis. Therefore, this study aimed to define Sentiment Analysis and review the approaches and techniques in Sentiment Analysis from conventional Unimodal to Multimodal. In addition, this paper discusses a Multimodal Sentiment Analysis architecture using a transformers attention net."

The neural networks are trained based on aggregated flight data from human experts, learning the implicit policy for visual obstacle avoidance by extracting the necessary features within the image. The images and flight data are collected from a simulated environment provided by Gazebo, and Robot Operating System is used to provide the communication nodes for the framework.

Efficient genomic selection using ensemble learning and ensemble feature reduction,2020,"['Genomic selection', 'Machine learning', 'Rice', 'Dimensionality reduction']",,"Genomic selection (GS) is a popular breeding method that uses genome-wide markers to predict plant phenotypes. Empirical studies and simulations have shown that GS can greatly accelerate the breeding cycle, beyond what is possible with traditional quantitative trait locus (QTL) approaches. GS is a regression problem, where one often uses SNPs to predict the phenotypes. Since the SNP data are extremely high-dimensional, of the order of 100 K dimensions, it is difficult to make accurate phenotypic predictions. Moreover, finding the optimal prediction model is computationally very costly. Out of thousands of SNPs, usually only a few influence a particular phenotypic trait. We first of all show how ensemble-based regression techniques give better prediction accuracy compared to traditional regression methods, which have been used in existing papers. We then further improve the prediction accuracy by using an ensemble of feature selection and feature extraction techniques, which also reduces the time to compute the regression model parameters. We predict three traits: grain yield, time to 50% flowering and plant height for which the existing methods give an accuracy of 0.304, 0.627 and 0.341, respectively. Our proposed regression model gives an accuracy of 0.330, 0.674 and 0.458 for these traits. Additionally, we also propose a computationally efficient regression model that reduces the computation time by as much as 90% and gives an accuracy of 0.342, 0.580 and 0.411, respectively."
EEMD assisted supervised learning for the fault diagnosis of BLDC motor using vibration signal,2020,['· Condition monitoring · Continuous wavelet transform · Ensemble empirical mode decomposition · Fault diagnosis · Principal component analysis'],,"Predictive maintenance (PdM) has become a major issue in system health monitoring, as machines are operating under more complex and diverse conditions nowadays.Besides minimizing the risk of a catastrophic failure, a proper maintenance scheme can amplify system yield as well as largely reduce production and maintenance costs. This paper presents a comprehensive study of a permanent magnet brushless DC (BLDC) motor’s fault diagnosis using vibration signals. Based on the degree of deviation from the normal operating condition, three health states are chosen from the entire lifecycle of motor. Acquired signals are decomposed using ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and the appropriate intrinsic mode function (IMF) is selected based on the similarity index. Later, selected IMF is analyzed in time-frequency domain by using continuous wavelet transform (CWT) for better localization of fault frequencies. Several statistical features that indicate the health state of the motor are also extracted to diagnose different fault states. Later, feature dimensions were reduced using principal component analysis (PCA) technique and classified using a supervised machine learning technique named k-nearest neighbor (KNN). Extracted IMF from EEMD provides significant fault related information to detect and diagnose different fault states. Proposed method is effectively used to diagnose fault at the incipient stage as well as classify different fault states at incipient stage and severe stage."

In this study, we used data from the 2015 Korean children’s oral health survey to predict DMFT index and caries risk groups using statistical techniques and four different machine-learning algorithms.Methods: DMFT prediction models were constructed using multiple linear regression and four different machine-learning algorithms: decision tree regressor, decision tree classifier (DTC), random forest regressor, and random forest classifier (RFC). Thereafter, their accuracies were compared.Results: For the DMFT predictive model, the prediction accuracy of multiple linear regression and RFC were 15.24% and 43.27%, respectively. The accuracy of DTC prediction was 2.84 times that of multiple linear regression. The important feature of the machine-learning model, which predicts DMFT index and the caries risk group, was the number of teeth with sealants.Conclusions: Using data from the 2015 Korean children’s oral health survey, which is considered big data in the field of oral health survey in Korea, this study confirmed that machine-learning models are more useful than statistical models for predicting DMFT index and caries risk in 12-yearold children. Therefore, it is expected that the machine-learning model can be used to predict the DMFT score."

RFID and NFC systems that we know are also being used by applying automatic recognition technology. RFID systems have evolved to replace existing barcode systems in a variety of areas that can be utilized as automatic recognition technologies. The biggest problem with today's RFID-enabled auto-recognition systems is the conflict between the leader and the tag that occurs when sharing the radio spectrum. Collision occurs when a tag within the recognition distance sends a signal to the reader simultaneously. If multiple tags are present in the RFID system and want to be recognized at the same time, the recognition performance of the tags will be significantly reduced and the recognition system will be able to recognize them. Causes performance problems. In other words, collision arbitration is aimed at fast and reliable recognition between RFID readers and tags, so it must be done without fail. It's a necessary skill. Existing studies use a variety of complex multi-connection technologies and collision prevention algorithms to mediate conflicts between tags. The anti-collision algorithm between leader and tag proposed in this paper used mechanical learning used in artificial intelligence. The problem with the existing Anti-Collision algorithm is extracted by learning the appropriate number of frames to mediate tag conflicts using instructional learning. Performance was compared with existing algorithms. We would like to study how to improve the leader recognition rate by using collision prevention algorithm using mechanical learning in recognition between tags and readers."

Since the value of MBS issued through securitization of mortgage loans is critically affected by changes in cash flows of underlying assets (mortgage loans), it is important for both issuers and investors to predict the prepayment rate of underlying assets in an MBS pool. Therefore, we construct the prediction model for MBS prepayment rates using machine learning algorithm and compares the predictive power between either distinct machine learning models or predictor variable sets.To be specific, we compared the predictive power of the conventional model with the machine learning algorithm using variables such as mortgage interest rate spread and housing market factors, which were representatively used in the existing studies. In addition, by analyzing the model that adds the additional variables related to the attributes of underlying assets and the market condition variables at the time of issuance of MBS, we investigated how the predictive power varies according to the use of the predictor variables. Ridge Regression, LASSO, and Elastic net model were employed for each predictor variable set. To compare the prediction accuracy between those models and choose the optimal model, we embedded the model selection process in the algorithm so that the optimal model was selected based on the data.The results of the analysis suggested that Elastic net model shows the best prediction performance. Moreover, the prediction performance was maximized with the predictor variable including the variables related to the underlying assets, such as LTV, DTI, interest rates etc.This study is different from the existing machine learning research in that it builds data-driven process of selection for optimal variables, optimal models, and optimal parameters into the algorithm. In addition, this study empirically proves whether the use of machine learning can be more useful for predicting MBS prepayment rates, and suggests theoretical and practical implications by identifying which variables are important for prediction."

Many researchers have been studying interpolation methods to accurately reconstruct missing data. Recently, various machine learning technologies such as support vector regression, autoencoder, U-Net, ResNet, and generative adversarial network (GAN) have been applied in seismic data interpolation. In this study, by reviewing these studies, we found that not only neural network models, but also support vector regression models that have relatively simple structures can interpolate missing parts of seismic data effectively.We expect that future research can improve the interpolation performance of these machine learning models by using open-source field data, data augmentation, transfer learning, and regularization based on conventional interpolation technologies."

The data were divided into two subsets, which included a training data set and test data set in a ratio of 70:30. The results showed that NN displayed better performance in prediction accuracy than BRNN and SVM when optimizing one or two tuning parameters. The prediction accuracy was, on average, higher for chlorophyll a than for discharge, regardless of which machine learning algorithm was used. Identical results were also observed in the training data set. The two variables biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) played an important role in predicting chlorophyll a, whereas suspended solids (SS) was designated as the largest contributor for the prediction of discharge in all three algorithms.

Therefore, this study seeks to achieve more objective results and research efficiency by utilizing machine learning among artificial intelligence technologies that have been applied to various studies recently. The subjects of the study are limited to the cover and the first section of music textbooks for the third and fourth graders(nine types per grade, 18 volumes in total) according to revised music curriculum of 2015. As one of the machine learning techniques, K-mean Clustering in this research classifies the top 10 colors in the textbooks, and the HEX codes are converted to NCS codes through our proposed color conversion method.In this study, the results are as follows; First, regardless of the name of each chapter, textbooks, which consist of four to six chapters, only consider four season-related colors and images for music education. Second, chapter in the textbooks mostly uses colors and nuances of the GY(Green Yellow) and YR(Yellow Red), the neutral color scale and low-color chroma. Furthermore, the results show that the color of the cover for each chapter is mainly used as an accent or a dominant color, which is highly related to the text of each chapter this research focuses on. That is, although there are differences in colors in textbooks for each publisher, most of them set color images of each chapter and reflect them throughout the chapters to maintain color consistency in each chapter. However, given the importance of child color experience, various changes in the use and chroma of different colors are required. Lastly, this study also suggests that rather than fixed color images on a seasonal basis, it is more effective for music education to present the illustrations and colors matching the music score."

Through correlation analysis, valid variables were selected and meaningless variables were excluded. To reflect changes over time, dependent variables at baseline were treated as independent variables at later time points. The relationship between independent variables and the dependent variable after n point was subjected to Pearson correlation analysis.Results: The correlation (R2) was strongest after 3 hours, which was adopted as a dependent variable. According to root mean square error (RMSE) data, the proposed method was superior to the other machine learning methods. The XGboost algorithm showed the best predictive performance.Conclusion: This study is important given the current lack of machine learning studies pertaining to the domestic mining industry. In addition, using time series analysis in mining data will show further improvement. Before establishing a predictive model for the proposed method, predictions should be made using data with time series characteristics. After doing this work, it should also improve prediction accuracy in other domains."

We randomly divided the data into a training set (1,000) and test set (368). Five machine learning methods, i.e., support vector machine model, lasso logit model, naïve bayes, discriminant analysis, and K-nearest neighbor (KNN), with a 10-cross fold technique were used with the proposed model to predict OSA. We evaluated the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision of each model for three thresholds [Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI)≥5, AHI≥15, and AHI≥30]. Results: Among the machine learning techniques, KNN showed the best results compared to the other techniques. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision of OSA prediction were 87.0%, 91.0%, 74.4%, and 91.9%, respectively, based on AHI≥5. When the threshold of OSA was AHI≥15 or AHI≥30, KNN provided lower accuracy (79.6% each) and precision (79.0% and 68.7%), which were still higher than those of the other techniques. Conclusions: The model derived from the KNN technique exhibited the best performance based on its highest level of accuracy. We demonstrate that this model is a useful tool for predicting OSA."

In other words, from the point of view of behavioral economics, we define that humans can make biased judgments by relying on the heuristic rather than making decisions by rational and reasonable judgments. From this perspective, the domestic real estate market has continuously developed behavioral economics research to explain the behavior of economic players in the housing market since the early 2000s. From the perspective of behavioral economics, this study attempts to identify the factors of decision-making on housing sales in each group through quantitative economic models through logistic regression analysis and machine learning models such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBost, LightGBM, Gradient Boosting, and MLP. It is also different from prior research in that it has applied a metering economy model and machine learning model to build a more predictable model of decision-making on housing sales. This study established the most predictable MLP model for decision-making on housing sales in each group, and the analysis showed that the loss group did not sell the house as the housing price rose, which can be interpreted as a result of the tendency to avoid selling and retain it even if the housing price is lost."

In addition to the purpose of stealing personal information, malwares for occupying resources of smartphones are emerging, and accordingly, techniques for detecting various types of malwares are required. However, unlike PC, mobile has various limitations. This makes it difficult for malwares to act and detection, thus efficient malware detection techniques using limited resources are being developed. The malware detection techniques include signature-based and cloud server-based methods. However, such a malware detection has a limitation in that it is difficult to quickly detect variants of known malwares or new ones, and there is a risk of interfering with or removing the detection method through an elevation attack. In addition, a result in incorrect analysis may be received due to a network communication problem. For this reason, research on next-generation heuristic detection techniques based on machine learning is increasing in recent years. This paper introduces various Android-based malware detection techniques developed from 2012 to 2020, and analyzes the trend of changes in algorithms used for detection. In addition, it classifies the data used for learning in machine learning, organizes the features of algorithms suitable for learning, and finally presents the result of detecting malwares using a deep artificial neural network and authority."

Moreover, the big data accumulated therein can be used as material for better understanding human beings. In this study, we proposed a quantitative evaluation method using artificial intelligence, in addition to two axes of a self-reported test, which is used mainly in personality evaluations, and observational evaluations made by teachers or experts. This study attempted to quantitatively express the positiveness of students, with the thinking that personality is not related to positive virtues. Since the student uses the reflection notes, essays, and testimonials generated during the character education process, there is no need for separate evaluation tools or time and space resources. In addition, automation that makes use of machine learning enables easy extraction of changes over time, regardless of the number of employees. Therefore, it is possible to compare personality values between groups and to compare numbers within groups, which can be used as data for screening individuals or groups requiring consultation or in-depth investigation. This study can be used as a sort of dictionary for in-depth interviews by finding out singularities through the quantification of individual changes over time. In other words, it is possible to know the change of the learner's positive and negative attitude over time, which in turn can be used as data in order to examine in detail data pertaining to the date when the negative index is high. As an example of another method of use, it is possible to compare personality values between groups, or to compare individual figures within groups, and to use them as data for screening individuals or groups requiring consultation or in-depth investigation. At the beginning of the study, we started with the assumption that people can be viewed as possessing both positive and negative aspects.

Accordingly, seabed multiples need to be suppressed throughout data processing.Conventional model-driven methods, such as prediction-error deconvolution, Radon filtering, and data-driven methods, such as the surface-related multiple elimination technique, have been used to attenuate multiple reflections. However, the vast majority of processing workflows require time-consuming steps when testing and selecting the processing parameters in addition to computational power and skilled data-processing techniques.

The shape of the impactor was precisely predicted by the unknown impactor from the voltage drop data, which are not included in the training process of the random forest. This study is significant in that it predicts the shape of the initial impactor through the machine learning technique by reflecting a multitude of object signals rather than based on specific parameters."

Currently, the risk of the cardiovascular disease for domestic patients is based on the Framingham risk score (FRS), but accuracy tends to decrease because it is a foreign guideline. Also, it can't score the risk of cerebrovascular disease. CCD is hard to predict, because it is difficult to analyze the features of early symptoms for prevention. Therefore, proper prediction method for Koreans is needed. The purpose of this paper is validating IG-MLP (Information Gain - Multilayer Perceptron) evaluation based feature selection method using CCD data with simulation. The proposed method uses the raw data of the 4<sup>th</sup> ~ 7<sup>th</sup> of The Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). To select the important feature of CCD, analysis on the attributes using IG-MLP are processed, finally CCD prediction ANN model using optimize feature set is provided. Proposed method can find important features of CCD prediction of Koreans, and ANN model could predict more accurate CCD for Koreans."

The data used in the analysis totaled 10,545 rows, consisting of 160 columns including 38 in the statement of financial position, 26 in the statement of comprehensive income, 11 in the statement of cash flows, and 76 in the index of financial ratios. Unlike most previous prior studies used the default event as the basis for learning about default risk, this study calculated default risk using the market capitalization and stock price volatility of each company based on the Merton model. Through this, it was able to solve the problem of data imbalance due to the scarcity of default events, which had been pointed out as the limitation of the existing methodology, and the problem of reflecting the difference in default risk that exists within ordinary companies. Because learning was conducted only by using corporate information available to unlisted companies, default risks of unlisted companies without stock price information can be appropriately derived. Through this, it can provide stable default risk assessment services to unlisted companies that are difficult to determine proper default risk with traditional credit rating models such as small and medium-sized companies and startups. Although there has been an active study of predicting corporate default risks using machine learning recently, model bias issues exist because most studies are making predictions based on a single model. Stable and reliable valuation methodology is required for the calculation of default risk, given that the entitys default risk information is very widely utilized in the market and the sensitivity to the difference in default risk is high. Also, Strict standards are also required for methods of calculation. The credit rating method stipulated by the Financial Services Commission in the Financial Investment Regulations calls for the preparation of evaluation methods, including verification of the adequacy of evaluation methods, in consideration of past statistical data and experiences on credit ratings and changes in future market conditions. This study allowed the reduction of individual models bias by utilizing stacking ensemble techniques that synthesize various machine learning models. This allows us to capture complex nonlinear relationships between default risk and various corporate information and maximize the advantages of machine learning-based default risk prediction models that take less time to calculate. To calculate forecasts by sub model to be used as input data for the Stacking Ensemble model, training data were divided into seven pieces, and sub-models were trained in a divided set to produce forecasts. To compare the predictive power of the Stacking Ensemble model, Random Forest, MLP, and CNN models were trained with full training data, then the predictive power of each model was verified on the test set. The analysis showed that the Stacking Ensemble model exceeded the predictive power of the Random Forest model, which had the best performance on a single model. Next, to check for statistically significant differences between the Stacking Ensemble model and the forecasts for each individual model, the Pair between the Stacking Ensemble model and each individual model was constructed. Because the results of the Shapiro-wilk normality test also showed that all Pair did not follow normality, Using the nonparametric method wilcoxon rank sum test, we checked whether the two model forecasts that make up the Pair showed statistically significant differences. The analysis showed that the forecasts of the Staging Ensemble model showed statistically significant differences from those of the MLP model and CNN model. In addition, this study can provide a methodology that allows existing credit rating agencies to apply machine learning-based bankruptcy risk prediction methodologies, given that traditional credit rating models can a"

So, to prevent the failure and protect participants from their loss of time and money, predicting the success of the funding in the early step is crucial. Therefore, this study aims to build a model to predict whether the crowdfunding project will success or fail.

Moreover, on the basis of various experimental data set, many empirical or semi-empirical formulas based primarily on regression analysis have been proposed to quantitatively estimate wave breaking for engineering applications. However, wave breaking has an inherent variability, which imply that a linear statistical approach such as linear regression analysis might be inadequate. This study presents an alternative nonlinear method using an neural network, one of the machine learning methods, to estimate breaking wave height and breaking depth. The neural network is modeled using Tensorflow, a machine learning open source platform distributed by Google.

In the simulations, the correlation between the hyper-elastic model coefficients and the selected measurement data is analyzed through the replicate simulation. A predictive flow graph using TensorFlow is obtained using the acquired data and machine learning techniques. Using these predictive flow graphs, the random hyper-elastic model coefficients are predicted. In addition, the model coefficients of real hyper-elastic materials are predicted using the developed algorithm. Although the accuracy of the prediction is decreased, the model coefficient prediction techniques using manipulator and machine learning algorithms show great potential. An improvement to the pressure test will be attempted in the future to increase the probability of the measuring field."

The Flush+Reload attack, one of the cache side channel attack, can be applied to malicious application attacks due to its properties of high resolution and low noise. In this paper, we proposed a detection system, which detects the cache-based attacks using the PCM(Performance Counter Monitor) for monitoring CPU cache activity. Especially, we observed the variation of each counter value of PCM in case of two kinds of attacks, Spectre attack and secret recovering attack during AES encryption.

To overcome these limitations, many studies have applied machine learning techniques to Context-aware systems.

However, the process gives rise to a nonlinear temperature variation, which is difficult to predict using a traditional physics model. As an alternative, this study employed machine-learning technology to predict such temperature variation for the first time. Mg alloy was exposed to a single electropulse with a variety of pulse magnitudes and durations for this purpose. Nine machine-learning models were established from algorithms from artificial neural network (ANN), deep neural network (DNN), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The ANN models showed an insufficient predicting capability with respect to the region of peak temperature, where temperature varied most significantly. The DNN models were built by increasing model complexity, enhancing architectures, and tuning hyperparameters. They exhibited a remarkable improvement in predicting capability at the heating-cooling boundary as well as overall estimation. As a result, the DNN-2 model in this group showed the best prediction of nonlinear temperature variation among the machinelearning models built in this study. The XGBoost model exhibited poor predicting performance when default hyperparameters were applied. However, hyperparameter tuning of learning rates and maximum depths resulted in a decent predicting capability with this algorithm. Furthermore, XGBoost models exhibited an extreme reduction in learning time compared with the ANN and DNN models. This advantage is expected to be useful for predicting more complicated cases including various materials, multi-step electropulses, and electrically-assisted forming."

The mmWave possesses shortcomings, such as signal attenuation and reduced transmission distance, owing to their short wavelength and high frequencies. To overcome this issue, mmWave systems adopt beamforming techniques, which require robust channel estimation and tracking algorithms to maintain an adequate quality of service. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based channel estimation and tracking algorithm for vehicle-to-infrastructure mmWave communications. More specifically, a deep neural network (DNN) is leveraged to learn the mapping function between the received training signals and the mmWave channel for channel estimation. Following channel estimation, long short-term memory (LSTM) is leveraged to track the channel. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm efficiently estimates and tracks the mmWave channel with negligible training overhead."

Wildfires weaken the shear strength of the soil, forming a layer of soil that is vulnerable to landslides. It is important to identify the severity of a wildfire as well as the burned area to sustainably manage the forest. Although satellite remote sensing has been widely used to map wildfire severity, it is often difficult to determine the severity using only the temporal change of satellite-derived indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR).In this study, we proposed an approach for determining wildfire severity based on machine learning through the synergistic use of Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar-C data and Sentinel-2A Multi Spectral Instrument data. Three wildfire cases–Samcheok in May 2017, Gangreung·Donghae in April 2019, and Gosung·Sokcho in April 2019–were used for developing wildfire severity mapping models with three machine learning algorithms (i.e., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine). The results showed that the random forest model yielded the best performance, resulting in an overall accuracy of 82.3%. The cross-site validation to examine the spatiotemporal transferability of the machine learning models showed that the models were highly sensitive to temporal differences between the training and validation sites, especially in the early growing season. This implies that a more robust model with high spatiotemporal transferability can be developed when more wildfire cases with different seasons and areas are added in the future."

In particular, the next-generation industries represented by artificial intelligence (AI) are presenting a future of unpredictable forms that have no historical origin.When countries are busy with social and institutional rearrangements for technological innovation in order to survive the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it is necessary to discuss what problems the copyright sector has and how to solve it.

The current discussion on artificial intelligence seems to focus on the discussion of whether AI can recognize this as a work for the output produced as a result of learning, and if so, who is the author.This study considered how artificial intelligence uses existing human-created works as a legal basis in the learning process such as machine learning, and whether copyright infringement can be indemnified for the purpose of industrial development. In particular, I would like to examine whether the study of highly intelligent AI can be permitted under the principle of fair use, which is a general provision of copyright restrictions.The fair use doctrine is to recognize the protection of 'expression of human creators' first and to use it as a tool to practice it, so that the alienation of human creators can be prevented by the development of technology.

Methods Electronic medical records (n = 494) of present illness were collected retrospectively in inpatient admission notes with three diagnoses of major depressive disorder, type 1 bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Data were split into 400 training data and 94 independent validation data. Data were vectorized by two different models such as term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and Doc2vec. Machine learning models for classification including stochastic gradient descent, logistic regression, support vector classification, and deep learning (DL) were applied to predict three psychiatric diagnoses. Five-fold cross-validation was used to find an effective model. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were measured for comparison between the models. Results Five-fold cross-validation in training data showed DL model with Doc2vec was the most effective model to predict the diagnosis (accuracy = 0.87, F1-score = 0.87). However, these metrics have been reduced in independent test data set with final working DL models (accuracy = 0.79, F1-score = 0.79), while the model of logistic regression and support vector machine with Doc2vec showed slightly better performance (accuracy = 0.80, F1-score = 0.80) than the DL models with Doc2vec and others with TF-IDF. Conclusions The current results suggest that the vectorization may have more impact on the performance of classification than the machine learning model. However, data set had a number of limitations including small sample size, imbalance among the category, and its generalizability. With this regard, the need for research with multi-sites and large samples is suggested to improve the machine learning models."

Since last century, the rapid population growth as well as accelerated industrialization and explosive urbanization lead to boost demand for groundwater for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. In fact, better management of groundwater can play crucial role in sustainable development; therefore, determining accurate location of groundwater based groundwater potential mapping is indispensable. In recent years, integration of machine learning techniques, Geographical Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) are popular and effective methods employed for groundwater potential mapping. For determining the status of the integrated approach, a systematic review of 94 directly relevant papers were carried out over the six previous years (2015-2020). According to the literature review, the number of studies published annually increased rapidly over time. The total study area spanned 15 countries, and 85.1% of studies focused on Iran, India, China, South Korea, and Iraq. 20 variables were found to be frequently involved in groundwater potential investigations, of which 9 factors are almost always present namely slope, lithology (geology), land use/land cover (LU/LC), drainage/river density, altitude (elevation), topographic wetness index (TWI), distance from river, rainfall, and aspect. The data integration was carried random forest, support vector machine and boost regression tree among the machine learning techniques. Our study shows that for optimal results, groundwater mapping must be used as a tool to complement field work, rather than a low-cost substitute. Consequently, more study should be conducted to enhance the generalization and precision of groundwater potential map."

To accomplish the requirement, the network manager performs graph construction and resource allocation about network topology, and determines the transmission cycle and path of each node in advance. However, this network management scheme cannot treat mobile devices that cause continuous topology changes because graph reconstruction and resource reallocation should be performed as network topology changes. That is, despite the growing need of mobile devices in many industries, existing scheme cannot adequately respond to path failure caused by movement of mobile device and packet loss in the process of path recovery. To solve this problem, a network management scheme is required to prevent packet loss caused by mobile devices. Thus, we analyse the location and movement cycle of mobile devices over time using machine learning for predicting the mobility pattern. In the proposed scheme, the network manager could prevent the problems caused by mobile devices through performing graph construction and resource allocation for the predicted network topology based on the movement pattern. Performance evaluation results show a prediction rate of about 86% compared with actual movement pattern, and a higher packet delivery ratio and a lower resource share compared to existing scheme."

In particular, deep-learning techniques are gaining in popularity as the number of cases successfully solving complex and nonlinear problems has gradually increased. In this paper, applications of seismic data denoising methods using deep-learning techniques are introduced and investigated. Depending on the type of attenuated noise, these studies are grouped into denoising applications of coherent noise, random noise, and the combination of these two types of noise. Then, we investigate the deep-learning techniques used to remove the corresponding noise. Unlike conventional methods used to attenuate seismic noise, deep neural networks, a typical deep-learning technique, learn the characteristics of the noise independently and then automatically optimize the parameters. Therefore, such methods are less sensitive to generalized problems than conventional methods and can reduce labor costs. Several studies have also demonstrated that deep-learning techniques perform well in terms of computational cost and denoising performance. Based on the results of the applications covered in this paper, the pros and cons of the deep-learning techniques used to remove seismic noise are analyzed and discussed."

Because workpieces used for large aircrafts parts are expensive and require strict processing quality, a maintenance plan is required to minimize the deterioration of the workpiece quality that can be caused by unexpected abnormalities of the tool and take maintenance measures at an earlier stage that does not adversely affect the machining. In this paper, we propose a method to indirectly monitor the tool condition that can affect the machining quality of large aircraft parts through real-time monitoring of the current signal applied to the spindle motor during machining by comparing whether the monitored current shows an abnormal pattern during actual machining by using this as a reference pattern. First, 30 types of tools are used for machining large aircraft parts, and three tools with relatively frequent breakages among these tools were selected as monitoring targets by reflecting the opinions of processing experts in the field. Second, when creating the CNC machining program, the M code, which is a CNC auxiliary function, is inserted at the starting and ending positions of the tool to be monitored using the editing tool, so that monitoring start and end times can be notified. Third, the monitoring program was run with the M code signal notified from the CNC controller by using the DAQ (Data Acquisition) device, and the machine learning algorithms for detecting abnormality of the current signal received in real time could be used to determine whether there was an abnormality. Fourth, through the implementation of the prototype system, the feasibility of the method proposed in this paper was shown and verified through an actual example."

Whilst a high gain disturbance observer could estimate the system states and the external disturbance successfully, the high gain of the observer can cause problems in the presence of the measurement noise.

A detection line is designated at the position where a human appears first in a sensing area, and only the one-dimensional gray pixel values of the line are monitored. If any noticeable change occurs in the detection line, corner detection and optical flow computation are performed in the vicinity of the detection line to confirm the change. When significant changes are observed in the corner numbers and optical flow vectors, the final determination of human presence in the monitoring area is performed using the Histograms of Oriented Gradients method and a Support Vector Machine. The proposed method requires processing only specific small areas of two consecutive gray images. Furthermore, this method enables operation not only in a static condition with a fixed camera, but also in a dynamic condition such as an operation using a camera attached to a moving vehicle."

Most sensitive private data and service business data are restricted to flow outside, and even with the data protection arrangements such as encryption and de-identification, the data collection sites are major targets of security breach. In federated learning, instead of collecting data, learning algorithms are run at each of various servers and devices where data are stored, and the resulting models are sent to a central server to build a global integrated model, which is then deployed back to each data server and device. Federated learning is an innovative approach that can be adopted in various areas including (1) an edge computing system where data storage, computation, and application are carried out at close locations using mobile devices and distributed servers, (2) application of highly flow-restrictive intra-enterprise service data, and (3) integration of intra-industry services using hardly sharable data. In this paper, we introduce previous research work for efficiently adopting and managing federated learning models that are adequate for various enterprise computing environments and present the issues and future research directions for improvement of enterprise federated learning frameworks. We believe that enterprise federated learning will solve many machine learning problems in B2B and B2C environments without data movements and therefore play a crucial role of leading data-centric industrial innovations."

However, previous research doesn't utilize time series input features and has a limited prediction timing. Furthermore, in the case of corporate bond credit rating forecast, corporate sample is limited because only large companies are selected for corporate bond credit rating. To address limitations of prior research, this study attempts to implement a predictive model with more sample companies, which can adjust the forecasting point at the present time by using the credit score information and corporate information in time series.Design/methodology/approachTo implement this forecasting model, this study uses the sample of 2,191 companies with KIS credit scores for 18 years from 2000 to 2017. For improving the performance of the predictive model, various financial and non-financial features are applied as input variables in a time series through a sliding window technique. In addition, this research also tests various machine learning techniques that were traditionally used to increase the validity of analysis results, and the deep learning technique that is being actively researched of late.FindingsRNN-based stateful LSTM model shows good performance in credit rating prediction. By extending the forecasting time point, we find how the performance of the predictive model changes over time and evaluate the feature groups in the short and long terms. In comparison with other studies, the results of 5 classification prediction through label reclassification show good performance relatively.

The data for the atomic structures and the corresponding total energies were generated by using the ab-initio molecular dynamic simulation, by which the artificial neural network (ANN) was trained to predict the total energies of the materials. Two ANNs were assigned: one to simulate (i) the dependence of the atom-pair interaction energy on the distance between the nearest atoms and the other to simulate (ii) the angular distortion energy. We found that compared to the true energies the total energies of Si could be successfully predicted with an error of about 1 meV/atom for atomic structures generated at 300 K, and that the dependence of the atomic interaction energy on the distance and the angular distortion energy could be obtained by training an ANN for atomic structures of various volumes."

Unlike conventional machine learning methods that use the hand-crafted features, we adopt the denoising autoencoder in order to generate a precise and accurate representation of the pixels. We first construct a hybrid vector that combines original image, difference of Gaussians and image gradients. The created hybrid features are then given to a deep autoencoder that learns the pixels’ internal dependencies and the cells’ shape and boundary information. The latent representations learned by the autoencoder are used as the inputs of a softmax classification layer and the direct outputs from the classifier represent the coarse segmentation mask.Finally, the classifier’s outputs are used as prior information for a graph partitioning based fine segmentation. We demonstrate that the proposed hybrid vector representation manages to preserve the global shape and boundary information of the cells, allowing to retrieve the majority of the cellular patterns without the need of any post-processing."

The machines for these automation processes are controlled based on the data collected from the sensors attached to them, and further, the processes are managed.Conventionally, the abnormalities of sensors are periodically checked and managed. However, due to various environmental factors and situations in the industrial field, there are cases where the inspection due to the failure is not missed or failures are not detected to prevent damage due to sensor failure.In addition, even if a failure occurs, it is not immediately detected, which worsens the process loss.Therefore, in order to prevent damage caused by such a sudden sensor failure, it is necessary to identify the failure of the sensor in an embedded system in real-time and to diagnose the failure and determine the type for a quick response. In this paper, a deep neural network-based fault diagnosis system is designed and implemented using Raspberry Pi to classify typical sensor fault types such as erratic fault, hard-over fault, spike fault, and stuck fault. In order to diagnose sensor failure, the network is constructed using Google's proposed Inverted residual block structure of MobilieNetV2. The proposed scheme reduces memory usage and improves the performance of the conventional CNN technique to classify sensor faults."

The results showed that the ConvLSTM model outperformed the LSTM model, resulting in a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.33℃ and a mean difference of -0.0098℃. Seasonal comparison also showed the superiority of ConvLSTM to LSTM for all seasons. However, in summer, the prediction accuracy for both models with all lead times dramatically decreased, resulting in RMSEs of 0.48℃ and 0.27℃ for LSTM and ConvLSTM, respectively. This study also examined the prediction of abnormally high SST based on three ocean heatwave categories (i.e., warning, caution, and attention) with the lead time from one to seven days for an ocean heatwave case in summer 2017.

More detailed indicators of self-regulated learning such as students’ watching frequencies of online lectures before and after each class need to be measured and modeled to predict students’ academic success via machine learning. This study aimed at exploring important variables for the prediction model as well as capturing students’ watching behaviors of online lectures. Students’ watching frequencies were coded using LMS log data from a graduate-level flipped classroom (FC). Combined with students’ background information, the final data for analysis consisted of 100 predictors in a course on introductory statistics. Enet (penalized regression) was employed among machine learning techniques mainly due to its interpretability. Without a quiz or an exam, the frequencies of video watching were important variables to predict students’ academic achievement as early as the first 2~3 weeks of the course.

AI is one of the materials in animation, but it already serves various uses in human life. Adobe Photoshop added machine learning-applied functions in 2014. Today there are many software programs applying machine learning in various fields including image synthesis and video editing. The computer is used in almost every stage of the animation production process these days, which raised a need to understand the concept of AI and examine and arrange AI-based software functions in the viewpoint of users instead of developers. The investigator thus arranged the basics and examined the ways that they were applied to software by making use of the images and concept diagrams made by himself so that any people could understand them.The findings show that Adobe Photoshop encompassed most of the various software functions based on AI in the field of image synthesis. In the field of video editing, Premiere featured completely different functions not found in other AI-based video editing programs. Unlike other AI-based video editing programs designed to select videos according to given texts or music and make it easy for common people to use them for creative purposes, Premiere has a goal of professional video editing and image correction as a universal tool.Animation is an attractive work of video that adolescents and youths like, providing creative texts to depict the fast-evolving times. Those who are involved in the field of animation need to have an open mind and attitude to make efforts to apply something new to the entire process from planning to production. It is expected that more applications and platforms will be created capable of easy and fun creation based on AI. The production of animation has pursued the goal of creating storytelling video content. In the future, it will be important to employ a broader viewpoint to develop content in the forms of creative tools that anyone can enjoy including machine learning developers based on the planning abilities and production skills. The findings of the present study will hopefully contribute to the efforts to teach and learn the basic knowledge for these new works."

It is true that methodologies based on these algorithms did not pay attention to inferences about the prediction error terms including the distribution assumptions. Recently, studies on prediction error and variance estimation for these methodologies have been actively conducted. This study examined the mean squared prediction error (MSPE) using the out of bag (OOB) method and bias. To adjust the bias, an estimation method using bootstrap was proposed and the efficiency was compared through simulation. Random forest was used as the machine learning methodology, and as a result of analysis, the proposed bias correction method was more efficient in simple polynomial models than in complex models."
Clinical applications and performance of intelligent systems in dental and maxillofacial radiology: A review,2020,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Deep Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Radiology']",,"Intelligent systems (i.e., artificial intelligence), particularly deep learning, are machines able to mimic the cognitive functions of humans to perform tasks of problem-solving and learning. This field deals with computational models that can think and act intelligently, like the human brain, and construct algorithms that can learn from data to make predictions. Artificial intelligence is becoming important in radiology due to its ability to detect abnormalities in radiographic images that are unnoticed by the naked human eye. These systems have reduced radiologists’ workload by rapidly recording and presenting data, and thereby monitoring the treatment response with a reduced risk of cognitive bias. Intelligent systems have an important role to play and could be used by dentists as an adjunct to other imaging modalities in making appropriate diagnoses and treatment plans. In the field of maxillofacial radiology, these systems have shown promise for the interpretation of complex images, accurate localization of landmarks, characterization of bone architecture, estimation of oral cancer risk, and the assessment of metastatic lymph nodes, periapical pathologies, and maxillary sinus pathologies. This review discusses the clinical applications and scope of intelligent systems such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and deep learning programs in maxillofacial imaging."

So far, biotope maps study was a tendency to focus on the type of vegetation, naturalness, land use, landscape ecology theories. However, biotope related studies have not reflected the concept of animal habitat, which is a component of biotope, and that is the limitation of biotope map research. This study suggest a methodology to predict potential habitats for fauna using machine learning to quantify habitat values. The potential habitats of fauna were predicted by spatial statistics using machine learning, and the results were converted into species richness. For biotope type assessments, we classified biotope values into vegetation value and habitat value and evaluated them using a matrix for value summation. The vegetation value was divided into 5 stages based on vegetation nature and land use, and the habitat value was classified into five stages by predicting the species richness predicted by machine learning.

The proposed method selects an optimal model after a sensitivity experiment, and then performs verification with the observed wind speed. The sensitivity experiment targets the data extracted by applying the sliding window method and the set factor values of machine learning. The elements used in the learning materials are time, spatial and meteorological factors (temperature, wind direction, humidity, precipitation). The meteorological data used was the value of ASOS 95 sites provided by the Korea Meteorological Administration from August 2017 to August 2018. As a result, the optimal machine learning method showed excellent predictive performance in the low wind speed section and the land terrain. In particular, it can be seen that the Random forest is the best in performance and time resources compared to Supporter vector machines and Deep neural networks."
이진 분류를 위하여 거리계산을 이용한 특징 변환 기반의 가중된 최소 자승법,2020,,,"Binary classification has been broadly investigated in machine learning. In addition, binary classification can be easily extended to multi class problems. To successfully utilize machine learning methods for classification tasks, preprocessing and feature extraction steps are essential.

In the weighted least squares, designing weights has a significant role. Due to this necessity, we also propose a new technique to obtain weights that can achieve feature transformation. Based on this weighting technique, we also propose a method to combine the learning and feature extraction processes together to perform both processes simultaneously in one step. The proposed method shows the promising performance on five UCI machine learning data sets."

It was recently discovered that more information could be gathered from biosignals by applying artificial intelligence (AI).At present, one of the most impactful advancements in AI is deep learning. Deep learning-based models can extract important features from raw data without feature engineering by humans, provided the amount of data is sufficient. This AI-enabled feature presents opportunities to obtain latent information that may be used as a digital biomarker for detecting or predicting a clinical outcome or event without further invasive evaluation. However, the black box model of deep learning is difficult to understand for clinicians familiar with a conventional method of analysis of biosignals. A basic knowledge of AI and machine learning is required for the clinicians to properly interpret the extracted information and to adopt it in clinical practice.

The researchers adopted a complexity perspective to understand this whole process as a part of dynamic conceptual ecologies in evolution. Within this framework, an academic concept, being developed as part of practical reality in the related field, came to existence to obtain a discursive power, or “governmentality,” adopting Foucault’s terminology, which authorizes collective legitimacy to the piecemeal of the fragmented practices, and to provide them justification and social values. To reveal the characteristics, we used two major scholarly databases to select articles whose researches have mainly focused on the notion of  lifelong learning.  One is SCOPUS scholarly database, the other is Korean research database of RISS. From the two databases, we compared the distribution of the articles whose main theme is related with lifelong learning, both in Korea and overseas. Upon the data collected, we found out that (1) the expansivity and interconnectivity of lifelong learning discourses between various academic fields is far restricted in Korea than overseas; (2) lifelong learning in Korea is more strictly bound within the territory of educational researches, while in overseas more articles were found in the areas such as medicine, engineering, social science, humanities, and others; (3) newly emerging research themes were created especially in the areas of artificial intelligence and machine learning that were standing over the platform of Industry 4.0 or post-humanism. Overall, the notion of lifelong learning today came to be a general and transdisciplinary concept that shares more connectivity and alliances in collective researches to shed “new” lights on the “old” phenomena of human learning in a new epoch. Nevertheless, the conceptual sophistication and major upgrade have not been supported enough by the original adult education research group; rather, the clock of the concept stopped at the point when it was first invented. All kinds of cliche and old implications are repeated without further evolution. Adult educators are no longer standing at the center of the academic leadership in this phenomenon."

The big data, which is actively used by the private sector, is also positively evaluated as a means of improving the efficiency of government agencies’ work and policy means. In particular, just as empirical research using traditional data is used as evidence for a policy, big data can be used in evidence-based decision making. This is because it allows researchers to investigate not only human society that has not been experienced before but also overall social phenomena by analyzing big data through the machine learning method that can analyze commonality and heterogeneity of data sub-populations and entire population in detail. At the same time, the massive volume of data makes it possible to make more accurate predictions. However, in most studies on big data related to making decisions or policies, the analysis approach of big data tends to be based on the traditional data approach method. As a result, it is pointed out that the policy results of big data analysis in the evidence-based policy perspective are not satisfied.

The similarity is measured by calculating the Euclidean distance of two output feature vectors. If the calculated similarity is less than the threshold, it is judged that two speakers are the same. The experimental result of the proposed speaker recognition based on the convolutional Siamese neural network showed its accuracy was achieved up to 96%. The accuracy of one-shot classification using the trained convolutional Siamese neural network was evaluated also.

Computer vision tasks such as object detection or object segmentation use intermediate features extracted from the same backbone such as Resnet or FPN for training and inference for object detection and segmentation. In this paper, an experiment was conducted to find out the compression efficiency and the effect of encoding on task inference performance when the features extracted in the intermediate stage of CNN are encoded. The feature map that combines the features of 256 channels into one image and the original image were encoded in HEVC to compare and analyze the inference performance for object detection and segmentation. Since the intermediate feature map encodes the five levels of feature maps (P2 to P6), the image size and resolution are increased compared to the original image. However, when the degree of compression is weakened, the use of feature maps yields similar or better inference results to the inference performance of the original image."
K-Means와 CNN을 이용한 변화된 환경에서의 전동기 고장 진단,2020,"['deep learning', 'K-means', 'CNN', 'diagnosis']",,"The most commonly used data for diagnosing the mechanical failure of a motor is vibration data. This vibration data is also used to diagnose motor failures in machine learning. However, there are many types of electric motors used in the industry, and the environment can vary according to the proposed use. To diagnose motor failure, data must be collected, labeled, and learned. In this way, it is very difficult to collect and label vibration data in consideration of all situations. For example, in identical situations, even if only the sensor changes, the CNN-only algorithm can fail to classify the data. In this paper, a method of learning CNN with learning data created by automatically classifying and labeling data using K-means is proposed. To apply K-means to fault diagnosis, FFT data was divided by frequency. For each frequency, the K-means algorithm was applied to calculate the centroid. The training data was used to calculate the similarity and distance to the centroid of the classified clusters. Using the calculated results, the centroid classified as the K-means was reclassified as normal or fault. This method using the K-menas could classify data, even if various data were entered. Finally, CNN was trained using the generated training data. Using this process, the existing CNN-only algorithm failed to classify the data when the sensor was altered, but the proposed algorithm classified the data and showed high accuracy."

This paper examines a machine learning-based modeling of the prediction of tomorrow’s PM10 concentration in the form of a gridded map using the AirKorea observations, Chinese cities’ air quality index, and NWP (numerical weather prediction) model data. A blind test using 23,048 cases in 2019 produced a correlation coefficient of 0.973 and an MAE (mean absolute error) of 4.097㎍/㎥, which is high accuracy due to the appropriate selection of input variables and the optimization of the machine learning model. Also, the prediction model showed stable predictability irrespective of the season and the level of PM10. It is expected that the proposed model can be applied to an operative system if a fine-tuning process using a larger database is accomplished."
Automated Analysis Approach for the Detection of High Survivable Ransomware,2020,"['Ransomware', 'supervised machine learning', 'Support Vector Machine', 'Artificial Neural Network', 'Term Frequency-Inverse document frequency']",,"Ransomware is malicious software that encrypts the user-related files and data and holds them to ransom. Such attacks have become one of the serious threats to cyberspace. The avoidance techniques that ransomware employs such as obfuscation and/or packing makes it difficult to analyze such programs statically. Although many ransomware detection studies have been conducted, they are limited to a small portion of the attack's characteristics. To this end, this paper proposed a framework for the behavioral-based dynamic analysis of high survivable ransomware (HSR) with integrated valuable feature sets. Term Frequency-Inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) was employed to select the most useful features from the analyzed samples. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were utilized to develop and implement a machine learning-based detection model able to recognize certain behavioral traits of high survivable ransomware attacks. Experimental evaluation indicates that the proposed framework achieved an area under the ROC curve of 0.987 and a few false positive rates 0.007. The experimental results indicate that the proposed framework can detect high survivable ransomware in the early stage accurately."
Adaptive Feature Generation for Speech Emotion Recognition,2020,"['Sentiment analysis', 'Machine learning', 'Speech feature', 'Feature generation']",,"The issue of emotion recognition has received considerable critical attention in artificial intelligence and machine learning. In sentiment analysis fields, researchers recognize emotional states from speech, electroencephalograms, and images, etc. The speech signal is among the most widely used in emotion recognition. There are many speech features, including pitch, energy, linear prediction coefficients, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, and the Teager energy operator. In this study, we explore the critical speech features for sentiment analysis. We modify our previous feature-generation method, which applies low-variance filtering and principal component analysis (for grouped features) to identify the features. We do not utilize between-class scatter here, but rather, the between class–scatter and within class–scatter ratio. Grouping is achieved according to the number of features—not correlation values. For an objective evaluation, we use the Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song, with a performance evaluation conducted in terms of classifier accuracy and computational complexity. Finally, we propose an effective feature-generation method to find the critical features for emotion recognition from speech."

The government and academia have presented various measures and conducted research to eradicate it, but it is not enough to catch up with evolving voice phishing. In the study, researchers focused on catching criminals and preventing damage from voice phishing, which is difficult to recover from. In particular, a voice phishing prediction method using the Fraud Detection System (FDS), which is being used to detect financial fraud, was studied based on the fact that the victim engaged in financial transaction activities (such as account transfers). As a result, it was conceptually derived to combine big data such as call details, messenger details, abnormal accounts, voice phishing type and 112 report related to voice phishing in machine learning-based Fraud Detection System(FDS). In this study, the research focused mainly on government measures and literature research on the use of big data. However, limitations in data collection and security concerns in FDS have not provided a specific model. However, it is meaningful that the concept of voice phishing responses that converge FDS with the types of data needed for machine learning was presented for the first time in the absence of prior research.

In this paper, we aim to provide the insight of the classification for Turing pattern image, which has high nonlinearity, with feature engineering using the machine learning without a multi-layered algorithm. For a given image data X whose fixel values are defined in [−1, 1], X − X3 and ∇X would be more meaningful feature than X to represent the interface and bulk region for a complex pattern image data. Therefore, we use X − X3 and ∇X in the neural network and clustering algorithm to classification. The results validate the feasibility of the proposed approach."
A new perspective towards the development of robust data-driven intrusion detection for industrial control systems,2020,"['Cybersecurity', 'Intrusion detection system', 'Nuclear power plant', 'Pattern recognition']",,"Most of the machine learning-based intrusion detection tools developed for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are trained on network packet captures, and they rely on monitoring network layer traffic alone for intrusion detection. This approach produces weak intrusion detection systems, as ICS cyber-attacks have a real and significant impact on the process variables. A limited number of researchers consider integrating process measurements. However, in complex systems, process variable changes could result from different combinations of abnormal occurrences. This paper examines recent advances in intrusion detection algorithms, their limitations, challenges and the status of their application in critical infrastructures. We also introduce the discussion on the similarities and conflicts observed in the development of machine learning tools and techniques for fault diagnosis and cybersecurity in the protection of complex systems and the need to establish a clear difference between them. As a case study, we discuss special characteristics in nuclear power control systems and the factors that constraint the direct integration of security algorithms. Moreover, we discuss data reliability issues and present references and direct URL to recent open-source data repositories to aid researchers in developing data-driven ICS intrusion detection systems."

Deepfakes rely on neural networks that analyze large sets of data samples to learn to mimic a person’s facial expressions, mannerisms, voice, and inflections. The process involves feeding footage of two people into a deep learning algorithm to train it to swap faces. In other words, deepfakes use facial mapping technology and AI(Artificial Intelligence) that swaps the face of a person on a video into the face of another person.  However, the tools and tactics of public sphere manipulation we are witnessing today are unprecedented. The unethical use of Big Data and machine learning to game the public sphere in pernicious ways marks a new point of departure. For example, through the intense level of surveillance of voters afforded through digital tools, AI allows political influence to move from public campaigns to private sentiment, a shift that repositions electoral politics from a spectacle that is overt to a script that is covert. Also, as the Internet has grown, so has misinformation. It is often claimed that we live in times of ‘post-truth’.  In this viewpoint, this dissertation inquires legal review of the status quo debate on theoretical access to the law-based argument of establishment and action and policy approach to the key issues in the related issues and the agenda concerned, which is concentrated on normalizing irregularity in post-truth created by deepfakes as types of images, videos, and audios.

합성곱 신경망 기반 향상된 GNSS 재밍 식별기법,2020,"['GNSS', 'Jamming', 'Jamming Classification', 'Machine Learning', 'Convolutional Neural Network', 'Confusion Matrix']",,"In this paper, we propose an improved global navigation satellite system (GNSS) jamming classification scheme using a convolutional neural network that directly uses an intermediate frequency (IF) sampled GNSS received signal without pre-processing. The machine learning-based GNSS jamming classification scheme recently proposed in [17] requires a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) process and a binary black-and-white image processing process through image mapping of the obtained spectrogram. The average jamming classification accuracy of the conventional scheme is approximately 94.31%, where the maximum, average, and minimum classification accuracies for single frequency modulation (FM) jamming are as low as approximately 89.55%, 83.43%, and 77.61%, respectively. The major performance deterioration factor of the conventional scheme is information loss caused by the pre-processing for the designed machine learning technique. To tackle this problem, we construct a sophisticated convolutional neural network (CNN) that directly uses the IF sampled GNSS received signal without pre-processing the conventional scheme. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, the confusion matrix of the jamming classification between the conventional and the proposed schemes is compared and analyzed by Monte-Carlo simulation using 106 test samples in five representative jamming environments with no jamming. As a result of the simulation, the average jamming classification accuracy of the proposed scheme is approximately 99.41%, which improves the classification accuracy by 5.1% compared with that achieved by the conventional scheme. Additionally, the average classification accuracy of 99.07% is dramatically improved by 15.64% compared with that achieved by the conventional scheme."

"Analysis of Smartphone Recordings in Time, Frequency, and Cepstral Domains to Classify Parkinson’s Disease",2020,"['Parkinson Disease', 'Voice Disorders', 'Telemedicine', 'Machine Learning', 'Classification']",,"Objectives: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder; it affects more than 10 millionpeople worldwide. Detecting PD usually requires a professional assessment by an expert, and investigation of the voice as abiomarker of the disease could be effective in speeding up the diagnostic process. Methods: We present our methodology inwhich we distinguish PD patients from healthy controls (HC) using a large sample of 18,210 smartphone recordings. Thoserecordings were processed by an audio processing technique to create a final dataset of 80,594 instances and 138 featuresfrom the time, frequency, and cepstral domains. This dataset was preprocessed and normalized to create baseline machinelearningmodels using four classifiers, namely, linear support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, random forest, and extremegradient boosting (XGBoost). We divided our dataset into training and held-out test sets. Then we used stratified5-fold cross-validation and four performance measures: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score to assess the performanceof the models. We applied two feature selection methods, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and least absolute shrinkageand selection operator (LASSO), to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset by selecting the best subset of features that maximizesthe performance of the classifiers. Results: LASSO outperformed ANOVA with almost the same number of features.With 33 features, XGBoost achieved a maximum accuracy of 95.31% on training data, and 95.78% by predicting unseen data.Conclusions: Developing a smartphone-based system that implements machine-learning techniques is an effective way todiagnose PD using the voice as a biomarker."

This has led to continuous reports of cases of forest damage due to physiological stress, not pest damage. In 2014, pine trees were collectively damaged in the forest genetic resources reserve of Sogwang-ri, Uljin, South Korea. An investigation was launched to determine the causes of the dieback, so that a forest management plan could be prepared to deal with the current dieback, and to prevent future damage. This study aimedto 1) understand the topographic and structural characteristics of the area which experienced pine tree dieback, 2) identify the main causes of the dieback, and 3) predict future risk areas through the use of machine-learning techniques. A model for identifying risk areas was developed using 14 explanatory variables, including location, elevation, slope, and age class. When three machine-learning techniques-Decision Tree, Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were applied to the model, RF and SVM showed higher predictability scores, with accuracies over 93%. Our analysis of the variable set showed that the topographical areas most vulnerable to pine dieback were those with high altitudes, high daily solar radiation, and limited water availability. We also found that, when it came to forest stand characteristics, pine trees with high vertical stand densities (5-15 m high) and higher age classes experienced a higher risk of dieback. The RF and SVM models predicted that 9.5% or 115 ha of the Geumgang Pine Forest are at high risk for pine dieback. Our study suggests the need for further investigation into the vulnerable areas of the Geumgang Pine Forest, and also for climate change adaptive forest management steps to protect those areas which remain undamaged."
Non-verbal Communication and Touchless Activation of a Radio-Controlled Car via Facial Activity Recognition,2020,['Smart glasses · Pattern recognition · Leverage · Support vector machine · Facial muscle activities · Sensor and actuator'],,"Many smart glasses technologies are being developed to improve the working effi ciency or quality of life in various fi elds. In some enterprises, these technologies are used to help improve the working quality and productivity and minimize data loss. In real life, smart glasses are applied as an entertainment device with augmented/virtual reality or as an assistive manipulator for the physically challenged. Thus, these technologies have mainly adopted various operating systems depending on usages, such as a touchpad, remote control, and voice recognition. However, conventional operating methods have limitations in non-verbal and noisy situations where people cannot use both hands. In this study, we present a method of detecting a facial signal for touchless activation using a transducer. We acquired a facial signal amplifi ed by a lever mechanism using a load cell on the hinge of an eyewear. We then classifi ed the signal and obtained their accuracy by calculating the confusion matrix with classifi ed categories through a machine learning technique, i.e., the support vector machine. We can activate an actuator, such as a radio-controlled car, through a classifi ed facial signal by using an eyewear-type signal transducer. Overall, our operating system can be useful for activating the actuator or transmitting a message through the classifi ed facial activities in non-verbal situations and in situations where both hands cannot be used."

Therefore, we examine whether machines can be considered the subjects of artistic creations through experiments on audiences’ appreciation of works by artificial intelligence (AI) and humans. According to our qualitative and quantitative findings, audiences reported no significant differences in appreciating works by AI and humans. Thus, it seems inappropriate to declare that “AI cannot be the subject of an artistic creation.”Prior to asking, “Can machines create art?” it is necessary to ask “Isn’t a human a kind of machine?” It is contradictory if we deny that humans are machines, because they are also formed by evolution, a mechanical algorithm. If humans are a type of machine, and if they also make art, eventually, this will come to mean that machines create art. In conclusion, it is not natural to deny the hypothesis, “Machines can be the subjects of artistic creations.”"

RSSI emitted from a beacon can be utilized to measure the distance between smart mobile objects that are moving indoors. However, reflection and diffraction phenomena that affect RSSI often result in inaccurate distance measurements. In this paper, multilateral machine learning algorithms are applied to enhance the accuracy of distance measurements based on RSSI. First, a low-pass filter is used to correct estimates that overshoot among the measured RSSI data. Second, a parameter control leaning method is used and the distance translation equation is supplied with corrected RSSI data. Although this equation can predict distance from the strength of the RSSI signal it can generate errors when it comes to the range of the distances estimated. To reduce these range of distance errors, a back propagation neural network algorithm is applied. For performance evaluation, we compare the actual distance values with the estimated distance values that come from each stage during the multilateral machine learning. The estimated values were found to be close to the actual distances within the limited scope of distances tested, as such, we believe this technology can contribute to location awareness service applications in IoT networks."

This study proposes a reinforcement learning-based intersection signal model to minimizing waiting time. Based on Deep Q-Network algorithm, RL model computes signal patterns that reduce traffic congestion by taking into account real-time traffic flow. For practical applicability, RL model learning was performed including signal sequences and minimum green time constraints.

The traditional approach for this was to construct a mathematical model that considers the characteristics of infectious diseases, so prior knowledge about their characteristics is required. Recently, machine learning-based approach based on relevant data such as weather and past occurrences has drawn much attention. Although this approach is free from the limitation of the traditional approach, the input variables should be selected so that good prediction performance can be achieved. However, the importance of each input changes depending on when the prediction point is. In this paper, we propose a random forest-based prediction model for analyzing the change of variable importances according to the prediction point. To do this, we first collect and pre-process relevant data for the analysis. Then, we train a random forest and obtain the variable importances while changing the prediction point. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted various experiments for domestic infectious diseases and classified them into three clusters. Then, we extracted features from each cluster, such as important input variables and major changes."

Liberal education in the artificial intelligence age should present human values that differ from those of machines. As groundwork for this, there is a need to investigate the key elements of the Ariadne’s thread that will enable passage through the labyrinth from within the legacy passed down by liberal education.  The Hortus Deliciarum (Garden of Delights), produced by the abbess Herrad of Hohenbourg Abbey in the 12th century, presented a new milestone in the education of canonesses with respect to the needs of Church Reform at the time. One prominent work, “Philosophy and Seven Liberal Arts,” is a beautiful iconic image that depicts the tradition of liberal arts as a comprehensive philosophical system. The order of the wondrous world created by God is organized in an elaborate structure of circles, and the human knowledge system is arranged as tools for exploring such wonders. Education is intended to further the discovery and remembrance of the compositional principle and order of the world, thus leading humanity of the secular world toward Divine Wisdom.  The iconic image of circles reproduces the cosmology of its time visually and allows learners to find their place within the grand order. Knowledge allows learners to discover the wonders of the world and pursue “the beyond” that lies outside the garden of reality. Furthermore, it strengthens the vocation and identity of learners by making them recognize their own place within their relationships with the whole.  The iconic image of “Philosophy and Seven Liberal Arts” presents a strategy of education for passing through the labyrinth of an era. The Ariadne’s thread that will enable passage through the labyrinth can be obtained when the fundamental tool for learning, rather than the delivery of some knowledge, is in place. Its key elements are to provide the learning motivation to explore the wonders of the world, set the direction of learning, and strengthen the self-identity needed to continue the journey of learning."

Whilst a high gain disturbance observer could estimate the system states and the external disturbance successfully, the high gain of the observer can cause problems in the presence of the measurement noise. When measurement noise exists in the output, fault detection methods based on the estimated states may often result in false alarms. To solve the problem, this paper designs an adaptive DOB using Deep Q-Network (DQN) which is one of reinforcement learning algorithms. For the proposed observer design, this paper explains the definitions of the state, the action, and the reward for the reinforcement learning.

Financial market is also not an exception. Robo-Advisor is actively being developed, making up the weakness of traditional asset allocation methods and replacing the parts that are difficult for the traditional methods. It makes automated investment decisions with artificial intelligence algorithms and is used with various asset allocation models such as mean-variance model, Black-Litterman model and risk parity model. Risk parity model is a typical risk-based asset allocation model which is focused on the volatility of assets. It avoids investment risk structurally. So it has stability in the management of large size fund and it has been widely used in financial field. XGBoost model is a parallel tree-boosting method. It is an optimized gradient boosting model designed to be highly efficient and flexible. It not only makes billions of examples in limited memory environments but is also very fast to learn compared to traditional boosting methods. It is frequently used in various fields of data analysis and has a lot of advantages. So in this study, we propose a new asset allocation model that combines risk parity model and XGBoost machine learning model. This model uses XGBoost to predict the risk of assets and applies the predictive risk to the process of covariance estimation. There are estimated errors between the estimation period and the actual investment period because the optimized asset allocation model estimates the proportion of investments based on historical data. these estimated errors adversely affect the optimized portfolio performance. This study aims to improve the stability and portfolio performance of the model by predicting the volatility of the next investment period and reducing estimated errors of optimized asset allocation model. As a result, it narrows the gap between theory and practice and proposes a more advanced asset allocation model.  In this study, we used the Korean stock market price data for a total of 17 years from 2003 to 2019 for the empirical test of the suggested model. The data sets are specifically composed of energy, finance, IT, industrial, material, telecommunication, utility, consumer, health care and staple sectors. We accumulated the value of prediction using moving-window method by 1,000 in-sample and 20 out-of-sample, so we produced a total of 154 rebalancing back-testing results. We analyzed portfolio performance in terms of cumulative rate of return and got a lot of sample data because of long period results. Comparing with traditional risk parity model, this experiment recorded improvements in both cumulative yield and reduction of estimated errors. The total cumulative return is 45.748%, about 5% higher than that of risk parity model and also the estimated errors are reduced in 9 out of 10 industry sectors. The reduction of estimated errors increases stability of the model and makes it easy to apply in practical investment. The results of the experiment showed improvement of portfolio performance by reducing the estimated errors of the optimized asset allocation model.  Many financial models and asset allocation models are limited in practical investment because of the most fundamental question of whether the past characteristics of assets will continue into the future in the changing financial market. However, this study not only takes advantage of traditional asset allocation models, but also supplements the limitations of traditional methods and increases stability by predicting the risks of assets with the latest algorithm. There are various studies on parametric estimation methods to reduce the estimated errors in the portfolio optimization. We also suggested a new method to reduce estimated errors in optimized asset allocation model using machine learning. So this study is meaningful in that it proposes an advanced artificial intelligence asset allocation model for the fast-developing financial markets."

일반화 서포트벡터 분위수회귀에 대한 연구,2020,"['Epsilon Insensitive Loss Function', 'Machine Learning', 'Asymmetric Support Vector Regression']",,"Support vector regression (SVR) is devised to solve the regression problem by utilizing the excellent predictive power of Support Vector Machine. In particular, the ε-insensitive loss function, which is a loss function often used in SVR, is a function thatdoes not generate penalties if the difference between the actual value and the estimated regression curve is within ε. In most studies, the ε-insensitive loss function is used symmetrically, and it is of interest to determine the value of ε. In SVQR (Support Vector Quantile Regression), the asymmetry of the width of and the slope of the penalty was controlled using the parameter p. However, the slope of the penalty is fixed according to the p value that determines the asymmetry of ε. In this study, a new ε-insensitive loss function with p₁ and p₂ parameters was proposed. A new asymmetric SVR called GSVQR (Generalized Support Vector Quantile Regression) based on the new ε-insensitive loss function can control the asymmetry of the width of ε and the slope of the penalty using the parameters p₁ and p₂, respectively. Moreover, the figures show that the asymmetry of the width of ε and the slope of the penalty is controlled. Finally, through an experiment on a function, the accuracy of the existing symmetric Soft Margin, asymmetric SVQR, and asymmetric GSVQR was examined, and the characteristics of each were shown through figures."
Railroad Surface Defect Segmentation Using a Modified Fully Convolutional Network,2020,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Computer Vision System']",,"This research aims to develop a deep learning-based method that automatically detects and segments the defects on railroad surfaces to reduce the cost of visual inspection of the railroad. We developed our segmentation model by modifying a fully convolutional network model [1], a well-known segmentation model used for machine learning, to detect and segment railroad surface defects. The data used in this research are images of the railroad surface with one or more defect regions. Railroad images were cropped to a suitable size, considering the long height and relatively narrow width of the images. They were also normalized based on the variance and mean of the data images. Using these images, the suggested model was trained to segment the defect regions. The proposed method showed promising results in the segmentation of defects. We consider that the proposed method can facilitate decision-making about railroad maintenance, and potentially be applied for other analyses."

AMA 구현을 위해 프로그래밍 설계 능력 확보보다 선결되어야 할 문제는 도덕성에 대한 철학적, 심리학적, 뇌신경과학적 이해이다. 도덕적 판단은 고차원 수준의 정신 능력을 요구하기에 기억, 논리 추론과 같은 인간의 인지 능력을 재현하는 것만으로 AI의 도덕적 의사결정 능력을 확보했다고 단정하기 어렵다. AI 도덕성은 인간의 도덕성, 도덕판단을 모델로하기에 도덕적 행위자로서 AMA 구현을 위해 도덕적 경험의 축적, 도덕적 감정의 구현, 도덕성이 지닌 복잡성 확보, 도덕성의 관계성 측면을 모두 고려할 필요가 있다.

The problem that should be pre-determined rather than securing programming design ability for AMA implementation is the philosophical, psychological and neurological understanding of morality. Since moral judgment requires a high level of mental ability, it is hard to conclude that AI's moral decision-making ability has been secured just by reproducing human cognitive abilities such as memory and logic reasoning. AI morality is modeled on human morality and moral judgment, so as a moral agent, it is necessary to consider all aspects of the morality, including the accumulation of moral experience, moral emotion, the securing of the complexity of morality, and the relationship. The biggest task left for mankind to overcome AI myths and produce AMA as an ideal moral agent is a deep sarcasm about what kind of morality should be implemented. Based on this, it is necessary to consider the technical question of whether computers with this moral character are accessible by deep learning. Moral robots are required not only to have deep-rooted human emotional goals such as happiness, but also to have moral awareness, emotion, will, intuition, insight and practical skills surrounding moral judgment. For the realization of AMA, an understanding of the morality of computer engineer, ethicist and neuroscience should be cross-referenced. The question remains whether AI will create as diverse moral character as humans or realize the best moral human image that mankind should pursue. AI morality creates AI myths like neuromyths and demands more moral philosophy and ethical exploration of human beings in their approach to morality, as well as neuropsychological and neurological exploration. This calls for combining insights from moral psychology and neuroscience as well as moral philosophy and ethical considerations of certain moral principles, such as reciprocity and fairness, in order to provide engineers with data explaining the role of emotional computing and emotional intelligence in moral decision making."

Once developed, the ANN model can predict the CHF based solely on a set of input parameters (pressure, mass flux, quality and hydraulic diameter) without resorting to any physics-based model. It is intended to use the developed model to predict the DNBR under a large break loss of coolant accident (LBLOCA) in APR1400. The System Engineering approach proved very helpful in facilitating the planning and management of the current work both efficiently and effectively."

A method to improve workers’ well-being toward human-centered connected factories,2020,"['social sustainability', 'manufacturing ergonomics', 'human factors', 'Industry 4.0', 'human-centered connected factories']",,"One of the most actual and consistent drivers for the industry is sustainability, which includes three main pillars: environment, economics, and society. While numerous methods for environmental and economic sustainability assessment have been proposed, social sustainability assessment is still lacking in structured methods and tools, although human has always played a key role. Moreover, technological development is pushing the industrial world toward a new paradigm, the “Industry 4.0,” which embeds topics such as data digitalization, cyber-physical systems, and machine learning. It entails significant changes in human resources management, without reducing their importance. Humans were part of the manufacturing system from the first industrial revolution, and no automation or digitalization can be possible without humans. The industry can no longer underestimate the reasonable application of human factors and ergonomics principles to the workplace. For this purpose, the paper provides a novel transdisciplinary engineering method to measure and promote social sustainability on production sites. It exploits Internet of Things technology to support the (re)design of manufacturing processes and plants toward human-centered connected factories. To improve the workers’ well-being has positive effects on their health, satisfaction, and performance. The method has been implemented in a real industrial case study within the footwear industry. The sole finishing process has been analyzed from different perspectives to solve ergonomics-related problems and implement effective improvement strategies."

A methodology for evaluating human operator's fitness for duty in nuclear power plants,2020,"['Fatigue', 'Eye tracking', 'Fitness for duty (FFD)']",,"It is reported that about 20% of accidents at nuclear power plants in Korea and abroad are caused by human error. One of the main factors contributing to human error is fatigue, so it is necessary to prevent human errors that may occur when the task is performed in an improper state by grasping the status of the operator in advance. In this study, we propose a method of evaluating operator's fitness-for-duty (FFD) using various parameters including eye movement data, subjective fatigue ratings, and operator's performance. Parameters for evaluating FFD were selected through a literature survey. We performed experiments that test subjects who felt various levels of fatigue monitor information of indicators and diagnose a system malfunction. In order to find meaningful characteristics in measured data consisting of various parameters, hierarchical clustering analysis, an unsupervised machine-learning technique, is used. The characteristics of each cluster were analyzed; fitness-for-duty of each cluster was evaluated. The appropriateness of the number of clusters obtained through clustering analysis was evaluated using both the Elbow and Silhouette methods. Finally, it was statistically shown that the suggested methodology for evaluating FFD does not generate additional fatigue in subjects. Relevance to industry: The methodology for evaluating an operator's fitness for duty in advance is proposed, and it can prevent human errors that might be caused by inappropriate condition in nuclear industries."

In 1935, Entomologist and member of Kanamojikai, Tsunetaro Okazaki embarked on a research project related to Kanji. In a Kanji writing test conducted on 1479 elementary school students in Tokyo, the average number of correct Kanji per person was only 631. As a result of having 424 ordinary people select 1929 Kanji including regular use Kanji, the number of Kanji selected by 50 or less is 809, accounting for 42% of the total. As a result of examining the 60-day Chinese words in five newspapers, the total number of Kanji was 3542, of which 100 characters had an appearance frequency of 38.7% and 500 characters had an appearance frequency of 77.3%. Based on these results, Okazaki created a proposal to limit 500 Kanji characters. The proposed restrictions based on Okazaki’s empirical research are quite convincing. However, as can be seen from the results of the newspaper survey, it seems that the 500 character limit proposal is somewhat impossible in the situation where about 79% of the Chinese words are read aloud. Currently, the number of common use Kanji in Japan is 2136. Compared to the number of common use Kanji in the 1930s, it increased by 278 characters. Through empirical surveys, Okazaki was trying to reduce the number of Kanji that would be a substantial burden on learning. Now that we can enter a lot of Kanji using machines, we should take a serious look at Okazaki’s proposal."

This concept aims for the ‘harmonious development of human abilities’ based on the premise of both self-understanding and world-understanding. For the question of how to strengthen the competence of subjects in the current accelerated globally changing world is one of the major challenges faced today in the field of education.In order to detect global changes, Mega Trends and the 4th Industrial Revolution were set as key issues. Moreover, AI was closely looked at as a driving force that will play a crucial role in leading the world of the future. The development of AI, along with the rosy prospect of liberating humans from work and thus enriching their lives, has in fact caused many to take a negative view regarding suchcuttin g-edge science and technology. For sucha radical advancement may actually bring humanity itself to the brink of a crisis. Indeed, perhaps the most feared prospect is that AI might accelerate the rise of what is being called a “post-human” world. In relation to such a post-human era, the issues of human existence, the end of labor, and the inevitable gap arising between AI and humanity, were discussed.In the age of AI, liberal arts education should actively intervene in the achievements of advanced science and technology, as well as transform our perception and values of machines. For that purpose, it is necessary to instill the values of coexistence, symbiosis, and coevolution with non-human beings (animals, plants, ecosystems, nature, things, and the universe itself). In terms of contents, it is also necessary for us to improve the standard draft of the Korean National Institute for General Education so that it might better fit a post-human era. Given the influence of AI, we need to redesign the future of human beings who will be living with machines, and to provide a liberal arts program suitable for such a world. In this way, learner-centered education, design thinking, project-based instruction, and liberal learning should be enthusiastically supported.However, whether the era of artificial general intelligence (AGI) comes or not, the future of mankind will ultimately depend on human choice. The accountability of future liberal arts education should be found in raising the discernment, morality, and ethical awareness of learners, and to develop their faculty of judgment so that one may distinguish good from evil, right from wrong and beauty from ugliness. Digital literacy and ‘post-human literacy’ will obviously serve as fundamental skills in the future."

By releasing deep learning open source software to the public, the relationship with the developer community and the artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem can be strengthened, and users can perform experiment, implementation and improvement of it. Accordingly, the field of machine learning is growing rapidly, and developers are using and reproducing various learning algorithms in each field. Although various analysis of open source software has been made, there is a lack of studies to help develop or use deep learning open source software in the industry. This study thus attempts to derive a strategy for adopting the framework through case studies of a deep learning open source framework.  Based on the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework and literature review related to the adoption of open source software, we employed the case study framework that includes technological factors as perceived relative advantage, perceived compatibility, perceived complexity, and perceived trialability, organizational factors as management support and knowledge & expertise, and environmental factors as availability of technology skills and services, and platform long term viability. We conducted a case study analysis of three companies adoption cases (two cases of success and one case of failure) and revealed that seven out of eight TOE factors and several factors regarding company, team and resource are significant for the adoption of deep learning open source framework. By organizing the case study analysis results, we provided five important success factors for adopting deep learning framework: the knowledge and expertise of developers in the team, hardware (GPU) environment, data enterprise cooperation system, deep learning framework platform, deep learning framework work tool service.  In order for an organization to successfully adopt a deep learning open source framework, at the stage of using the framework, first, the hardware (GPU) environment for AI R&D group must support the knowledge and expertise of the developers in the team. Second, it is necessary to support the use of deep learning frameworks by research developers through collecting and managing data inside and outside the company with a data enterprise cooperation system. Third, deep learning research expertise must be supplemented through cooperation with researchers from academic institutions such as universities and research institutes. Satisfying three procedures in the stage of using the deep learning framework, companies will increase the number of deep learning research developers, the ability to use the deep learning framework, and the support of GPU resource. In the proliferation stage of the deep learning framework, fourth, a company makes the deep learning framework platform that improves the research efficiency and effectiveness of the developers, for example, the optimization of the hardware (GPU) environment automatically. Fifth, the deep learning framework tool service team complements the developers expertise through sharing the information of the external deep learning open source framework community to the in-house community and activating developer retraining and seminars.

The reason is that whether or not to be exempt from the threat of potential copyright infringement is the key for the development of artificial intelligence technology, which has a huge impact on the economy, society, and creative culture as well as science and technology. Todays economic advantage belongs to large-scale online platforms that use the data of others, not the existing rights holders or the license holders for exclusive rights such as copyright. Through machine learning technology, these companies can extract value from the protected expression of copyright holders without permission and use that value for commercial purposes that could one day endanger the livelihood of human creators. Constructing fair use to protect this activity would conflict with the public interest and could potentially exacerbate social inequality threatened by artificial intelligence. On the contrary, judging that machine learning of expressive use does not constitute fair use will frustrate advances in new technologies that will promote positive economic growth and social development. Machine learning will realize enormous social and economic benefits, and many of these benefits come from real human creative works. Such a fair use dilemma should go in the direction of enhancing social equity by reaffirming the purpose and purpose of the Copyright Act, which promotes the creation and dissemination of human expressions by guaranteeing the right to the expressive value of creative works to the copyright holder. This requires a paradigm shift and change that allows for the balanced consideration of various aspects, from the past perspective where the judgment of fair use was based solely on “works” to “technology”. The recognition or disapproval of fair use will cause irreversible social harm and technological retreat, so it will have to move in a way that conforms to the public interest of fulfilling the constitutional obligation of the Copyright Act on the basis of the new fair use judgment standard that can establish a balance point suitable for the artificial intelligence era."

The results of this study confirmed that the CNN showed higher performancecompared with other classifiers in the case of feature selection.

Therefore, it is crucial to accurately predict breaker index such as breaking wave height and breaking depth, when designing coastal structures. Numerous scientific efforts have been made in the past by many researchers to identify and predict the breaking phenomenon. Representative studies on wave breaking provide many empirical formulas for the prediction of breaking index, mainly through hydraulic model experiments. However, the existing empirical formulas for breaking index determine the coefficients of the assumed equation through statistical analysis of data under the assumption of a specific equation. In this paper, we applied a representative linear-based supervised machine learning algorithms that show high predictive performance in various research fields related to regression or classification problems. Based on the used machine learning methods, a model for prediction of the breaking index is developed from previously published experimental data on the breaking wave, and a new linear equation for prediction of breaker index is presented from the trained model. The newly proposed breaker index formula showed similar predictive performance compared to the existing empirical formula, although it was a simple linear equation."

This algorithm has the advantage of having high analytical consistency, but has the disadvantage that it is difficult to interpret the analysis results. However, in the manufacturing industry, it is important to verify the basis of the results and the validity of deriving the analysis algorithms through analysis based on the manufacturing process principle. To overcome the limitation of explanatory power as a result of this machine learning algorithm, we propose a manufacturing big data analysis method using genetic programming. This algorithm is one of well-known evolutionary algorithms, which repeats evolutionary operators such as selection, crossover, mutation that mimic biological evolution to find the optimal solution. Then, the solution is expressed as a relationship between variables using mathematical symbols, and the solution with the highest explanatory power is finally selected. Through this, input and output variable relations are derived to formulate the results, so it is possible to interpret the intuitive manufacturing mechanism, and it is also possible to derive manufacturing principles that cannot be interpreted based on the relationship between variables represented by formulas. The proposed technique showed equal or superior performance as a result of comparing and analyzing performance with a typical machine learning algorithm.

In the second step, based on the review of the literature, we will examine the current position of HR analytics and what advanced methodologies are needed for HR analytics in the future. As a result of the research, it can be seen that HR analytics remains at the stage of transitioning from technical analysis to predictive analysis in the business analytics value model, and advanced methodologies such as machine learning are needed to move to prediction and prescription analysis in the future.

This work presents new problems with the learning effect on the setup times to minimize the makespan, mean flow time, or total absolute differences in completion times (TADC). We derive the range of possible values of the learning constant and characterize the optimal schedules of the problems. We show that the problems with makespan or TADC are solvable in O(n log n) time. For the mean flow time, this research develops an algorithm with O(n log n) time complexity when the learning results from the total amount of the processing time of jobs already processed. We suggest another algorithm using the assignment problem model for the mean flow time with learning according to the sum of existing setup times.

However, it is necessary to create a new type of curriculum at a time when artificial intelligence curriculum has never existed before.

Recently, the field of natural language processing has been actively researched using pre-trained language representation models with a large amount of corpus. In particular, the named entity recognition, which is one of the fields of natural language processing, uses a supervised learning method, which requires a large amount of training dataset and computation. Reinforcement learning is a method that learns through trial and error experience without initial data and is closer to the process of human learning than other machine learning methodologies and is not much applied to the field of natural language processing yet. It is often used in simulation environments such as Atari games and AlphaGo. BERT is a general-purpose language model developed by Google that is pre-trained on large corpus and computational quantities. Recently, it is a language model that shows high performance in the field of natural language processing research and shows high accuracy in many downstream tasks of natural language processing. In this paper, we propose a new named entity recognition DeNERT model using two deep learning models, DQN and BERT. The proposed model is trained by creating a learning environment of reinforcement learning model based on language expression which is the advantage of the general language model.

Recently, as campaign channels have been expanded in various ways due to the rapid revitalization of online, various types of campaigns are being carried out by companies at a level that cannot be compared to the past. However, customers tend to perceive it as spam as the fatigue of campaigns due to duplicate exposure increases. Also, from a corporate standpoint, there is a problem that the effectiveness of the campaign itself is decreasing, such as increasing the cost of investing in the campaign, which leads to the low actual campaign success rate. Accordingly, various studies are ongoing to improve the effectiveness of the campaign in practice. This campaign system has the ultimate purpose to increase the success rate of various campaigns by collecting and analyzing various data related to customers and using them for campaigns. In particular, recent attempts to make various predictions related to the response of campaigns using machine learning have been made. It is very important to select appropriate features due to the various features of campaign data. If all of the input data are used in the process of classifying a large amount of data, it takes a lot of learning time as the classification class expands, so the minimum input data set must be extracted and used from the entire data. In addition, when a trained model is generated by using too many features, prediction accuracy may be degraded due to overfitting or correlation between features. Therefore, in order to improve accuracy, a feature selection technique that removes features close to noise should be applied, and feature selection is a necessary process in order to analyze a high-dimensional data set. Among the greedy algorithms, SFS (Sequential Forward Selection), SBS (Sequential Backward Selection), SFFS (Sequential Floating Forward Selection), etc. are widely used as traditional feature selection techniques. It is also true that if there are many risks and many features, there is a limitation in that the performance for classification prediction is poor and it takes a lot of learning time. Therefore, in this study, we propose an improved feature selection algorithm to enhance the effectiveness of the existing campaign. The purpose of this study is to improve the existing SFFS sequential method in the process of searching for feature subsets that are the basis for improving machine learning model performance using statistical characteristics of the data to be processed in the campaign system. Through this, features that have a lot of influence on performance are first derived, features that have a negative effect are removed, and then the sequential method is applied to increase the efficiency for search performance and to apply an improved algorithm to enable generalized prediction. Through this, it was confirmed that the proposed model showed better search and prediction performance than the traditional greed algorithm. Compared with the original data set, greed algorithm, genetic algorithm (GA), and recursive feature elimination (RFE), the campaign success prediction was higher. In addition, when performing campaign success prediction, the improved feature selection algorithm was found to be helpful in analyzing and interpreting the prediction results by providing the importance of the derived features. This is important features such as age, customer rating, and sales, which were previously known statistically. Unlike the previous campaign planners, features such as the combined product name, average 3-month data consumption rate, and the last 3-month wireless data usage were unexpectedly selected as important features for the campaign response, which they rarely used to select campaign targets. It was confirmed that base attributes can also be very important feature"

However, the computing resources required are also rising, making it difficult to learn from a typical environment. Attention mechanism is originally proposed to prevent the gradient vanishing problem of the recurrent neural network, but this can also be used in a direction favorable to learning of the convolutional neural network. In this paper, attention mechanism is applied to convolutional neural network, and the excellence of the proposed method is demonstrated through the comparison of learning time and performance difference at this time. The proposed model showed that both learning time and performance were superior in object detection based on YOLO compared to models without attention mechanism, and experimentally demonstrated that learning time could be significantly reduced. In addition, this is expected to increase accessibility to machine learning by end users."

After landmarking in the face images of a specific person, the proposed model use the previously learned Caffe model to extract face detection and embedding vector 128D. The learning is learned by building machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM) and deep neural network (DNN). Face recognition is tested with a face image different from the learned figure using the learned model. As a result of the experiment, the result of learning with DNN rather than SVM showed better prediction rate and recognition rate. However, when the hidden layer of DNN is increased, the prediction rate increases but the recognition rate decreases. This is judged as overfitting caused by a small number of objects to be recognized. As a result of learning by adding a clear face image to the proposed model, it is confirmed that the result of high prediction rate and recognition rate can be obtained. This research will be able to obtain better recognition and prediction rates through effective deep learning establishment by utilizing more face image data."

Finding the Optimal Data Classification Method Using LDA and QDA Discriminant Analysis,2020,"['Machine Learning', 'LDA', 'QDA', 'SVM', 'Classification Analysis']",,"With the recent introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the use of data is rapidly increasing, and newly generated data is also rapidly increasing. In order to obtain the results to be analyzed based on these data, the first thing to do is to classify the data well. However, when classifying data, if only one classification technique belonging to the machine learning technique is applied to classify and analyze it, an error of overfitting can be accompanied. In order to reduce or minimize the problems caused by misclassification of the classification system such as overfitting, it is necessary to derive an optimal classification by comparing the results of each classification by applying several classification techniques. If you try to interpret the data with only one classification technique, you will have poor reasoning and poor predictions of results. This study seeks to find a method for optimally classifying data by looking at data from various perspectives and applying various classification techniques such as LDA and QDA, such as linear or nonlinear classification, as a process before data analysis in data analysis. In order to obtain the reliability and sophistication of statistics as a result of big data analysis, it is necessary to analyze the meaning of each variable and the correlation between the variables. If the data is classified differently from the hypothesis test from the beginning, even if the analysis is performed well, unreliable results will be obtained. In other words, prior to big data analysis, it is necessary to ensure that data is well classified to suit the purpose of analysis. This is a process that must be performed before reaching the result by analyzing the data, and it may be a method of optimal data classification."

For this reasen, various studies have been conducted so far to predict infectious diseases. Most of the early studies relied on epidemiological data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the problem was that the data provided by the CDC was updated only once a week, making it difficult to predict the number of real-time disease outbreaks. However, with the emergence of various Internet media due to the recent development of IT technology, studies have been conducted to predict the occurrence of infectious diseases through web data, and most of the studies we have researched have been using single Web data to predict diseases. However, disease forecasting through a single Web data has the disadvantage of having difficulty collecting large amounts of learning data and making accurate predictions through models for recent outbreaks such as COVID-19. Thus, we would like to demonstrate through experiments that models that use multiple Web data to predict the occurrence of infectious diseases through LSTM models are more accurate than those that use single Web data and suggest models suitable for predicting infectious diseases. In this experiment, we predicted the occurrence of Malaria and Epidemic-parotitis using a single web data model and the model we propose. A total of 104 weeks of NEWS, SNS, and search query data were collected, of which 75 weeks were used as learning data and 29 weeks were used as verification data.

The recurrent neural network (RNN) was employed as a promising model for longitudinal prediction, and the performance of the RNN was compared with a traditional approach, the hierarchical general linear model (HGLM). The results showed that both RNN and HGLM models showed similar performances in the data collection designs to which both models can be applied. In addition, the RNN had advantages over the HGLM in that it can be also applied to situations where application of the HGLM is not feasible.

Model for Relational Analysis of Posted Articles and Reactions on Restaurant Guide Sites,2020,"['Machine Learning', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Restaurant Guide', 'Business Analytics']",,"Recently, restaurant guide sites providing restaurant information posted by users on the Internet have been widely used as effective tools for consumers. Users, on a restaurant guide site, utilize IDs to post their recommendation articles on restaurants, and these posted articles are a valuable information source for other users. Open users can search for restaurants and read recommendation articles posted by other users. Furthermore, they can react (e.g., “like”) to a recommendation article when they feel it is helpful or they feel like visiting the restaurant. On a target restaurant guide site, each post includes the user ID, restaurant name, recommendation sentences, etc., and the number of reactions is considered to depend on these posted contents. For users who post recommendation articles, the number of reactions to their posts represents the degree of empathy from other users and is an important motivation for posting. Therefore, posting users will benefit from guidelines on how to write good recommendation sentences to increase the number of reactions. Moreover, the number of reactions can be regarded as an important indicator of the activity level of the restaurant guide site from the viewpoint of the service operating company. Therefore, an analytical model developed using historical information such as posts and reactions by users would be useful for determining the relationship between posted contents and the number of reactions. Therefore, this paper proposes a model based on the machine learning approach to analyze the relation between the number of reactions and posted contents.

Variables affecting the use of building energy include the identification of environmental conditions, historical conditions, and schedule conditions, and these factors have a sophisticated effect on buildings. One of the most influential variables is the building schedule. Because each building has its own schedule, standardized schedules cannot be applied to various buildings, and it is difficult for non-experts to analyze or predict schedules in these cases. The aim of this paper is to propose a high-precision building energy demand prediction model by using a Fourier transform-based time series prediction model, that automatically analyzes and predicts the schedule to be applied when predicting building energy demand. In order to compare with the existing method, the six buildings are divided into schedules when they are not scheduled, weekdays/weekends, days of week and when schedule analysis algorithm are applied. Machine learning is performed using the LSTM model, and prediction accuracy is verified through the CvRMSE and MBE. There was an average difference of 15.37% based on the CvRMSE, and all predictions were predictable when the automated prediction model was applied. This study can be used as a building energy operation plan for the creation and implementation of a future energy-efficient smart grid system."

Genetic algorithm (GA) and principal component analysis (PCA) are the algorithms used for the selection or extraction process of the features; equipment condition. This study proposes a new method to maximize the advantages of the extraction and selection algorithms, thereby improving the fault classifi cation performance. The proposed method is estimated in a variety of equipment conditions by selecting and extracting the eff ective features for status classifi cation. To evaluate the performance of the fault classifi cation through feature selection and extraction of the ML, a comparative analysis with the proposed method and the original method is also performed. With Lab-scale gearbox, several types of fault tests are conducted, and seven diff erent fault types of equipment conditions, including the normal status, are simulated. The results of the experiments show that, the performance of classifi cation of GA for feature selection is 85%, while PCA for feature extraction is 53%. The performance result of the proposed method for fault classifi cation is 95%, meaning that the performance of fault diagnosis is more effi cient in terms of discriminative learning than the original method. Therefore, the proposed method with feature extraction and selection algorithm can improve the fault classifi cation performance by 10% and more for fault diagnosis through ML."

Therefore, it is not easy to distinguish potatoes from the soil surface background only with machine vision. This study applied Mask R-CNN, one of the object recognition technologies using deep learning to detect potatoes. The size of object in pixel was obtained on individual potato, and they will be used to predict the yield of potatoes.Methods In order to collect the images needed for deep learning, potato images at the time of harvesting were obtained from potato farms. Annotation was entered for each irregular potato shape, where approximately 4500 potatoes were used. Resnet-101 was selected as the backbone of Mask R-CNN with a feature pyramid network. Transfer training was applied to shorten training time and limit the number of images needed to train the model. The classification performance evaluation was conducted to verify the trained model. The size of potato in pixel was obtained from the output image through the potato detection model by the segmentation algorithm using MATLAB.Results The total number of training for the potato detection model was 12,000, and the training loss of Mask R-CNN was less than 0.1%. The potato detection results from 69 randomly selected test images showed that the average detection precision was 90.8%, recall 93.0%, and F1 score 91.9%.Conclusions Potato detection model with Mask R-CNN can detect irregularly shaped potatoes on similar color soil surface.

High turbidity during floods increases the operation cost of a drinking water supply system. Thus, the management of turbidity is essential for providing safe water to the public. There have been various efforts to estimate turbidity in river systems for proper management and early warning of high turbidity in the water supply process. Advanced data analysis technology using machine learning has been increasingly used in water quality management processes. Artificial neural networks(ANNs) is one of the first algorithms applied, where the overfitting of a model to observed data and vanishing gradient in the backpropagation process limit the wide application of ANNs in practice. In recent years, deep learning, which overcomes the limitations of ANNs, has been applied in water quality management. LSTM is one of novel deep learning algorithms that is widely used in the analysis of time series data.In this study, LSTM is used for the prediction of high turbidity(>30 NTU) in a river from the relationship of turbidity to discharge, which enables early warning of high turbidity in a drinking water supply system. The model showed 0.98, 0.99, 0.98 and 0.99 for precision, recall, F1-score and accuracy respectively, for the prediction of high turbidity in a river with 2 hour frequency data. The sensitivity of the model to the observation intervals of data is also compared with time periods of 2 hour, 8 hour, 1 day and 2 days. The model shows higher precision with shorter observation intervals, which underscores the importance of collecting high frequency data for better management of water resources in the future."
Development and Optimization of Deep Belief Networks Applied for Academic Performance Prediction with Larger Datasets,2020,"['Student performance', 'Deep learning', 'Restricted Boltzmann machine', 'Deep belief network', 'Feature selection', 'Hyperparameters', 'Regularization']",,"Deep learning has recently attracted increasing interest for several applications, and great progress has been made. This paper introduces a novel application of a deep learning framework called deep belief networks (DBNs) that can be used to predict the predicting academic performance of larger datasets. First, unsupervised training is considered a so-called pre-training section. The stacked restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) was trained to obtain the trained weights instead of random initial weights. Subsequently, supervised learning was adopted using backpropagation in the fine-tuning section to classify the student performance levels. An optimization approach for improving the classification performance of the proposed DBN was proposed. The optimization approach consisted of using a feature selection method to obtain the optimal feature subset, optimizing the DBN model with the optimal values of the hyperparameters, and applying the L2-regularization method for weight decay. The experiment was carried out with two phases. Phase1 was implemented with an actual dataset. Phase 2 was then implemented with four artificial datasets of increasing sizes. Many experiments were performed independently on each dataset. With a larger dataset, the improved DBN generated the highest accuracy and lowest root mean square error with more accuracy and effectiveness than the other proposed algorithms."
이상치 데이터를 고려한 DT-CNN 기반의 전동기 고장 예측,2020,"['Deep learning', 'Open-set recognition', 'DT-CNN', 'Motor fault prediction', 'Machine learning theory']",,"One of the major problems with the existing motor failure prediction system is to assume that all motors with the same fault condition have the same or a similar signal. This is a problem that arises because it is impossible to measure all the countless types of motors and data of driving conditions and failures. It is difficult to implement a general-purpose failure prediction system with an existing system having limited data and limited output. Data that have a large difference because they do not exist in the existing system are called outlier data. In previous studies, the problem arising from the outlier data has not been considered. To solve this problem, a system designed by separating the failure diagnosis model and the failure prediction model is proposed. The diagnostic model of the proposed system can detect data that are not inside big data using a decision-tree convolution neural network (DT-CNN). By using the diagnostic model and the predictive model in series, it is possible to analyze data in a non-measured state more efficiently. Additionally, a method for averaging the outputs of the diagnostic and predictive models is proposed. Through this, the deep learning algorithm can obtain in effect of applying the filter. Furthermore, the average values can be used to confirm the long-term signal change trend. The proposed system improves the problems of the existing failure prediction and enables more practical failure prediction."

In this paper, image classification is proposed by learning images of defects in the metal cross sections using the convolution neural network (CNN) image labeling algorithm. Defects were classified into three categories: crack, porosity, and hole. To overcome a lack-of-data problem, the amount of learning data was augmented using a data augmentation algorithm. This augmentation algorithm can transform an image to 180 images, increasing the learning accuracy. The number of training and validation images was 25,920 (80 %) and 6,480 (20 %), respectively. An optimized case with a combination of fully connected layers, an optimizer, and a loss function, showed that the model accuracy was 99.7 % and had a success rate of 97.8 % for 180 test images.

The proposed method includes a new learning model, Pix2Pix, which adds a latent vector to the existing Pix2Pix model, thereby generating a natural fingerprint. In the experimental results, the original fingerprint is restored using the proposed machine learning, and then, the restored fingerprint is the input for the fingerprint reader in order to achieve a good recognition rate. Thus, this study verifies that fingerprint readers using the skeleton are vulnerable to presentation attacks. The approach presented in this paper is expected to be useful in a variety of applications concerning fingerprint restoration, video security, and biometrics."
공정간 시간 제약을 가지는 Wafer Lot의 대기 시간 예측,2020,"['Deep learning model', 'Fab operation', 'Genetic algorithm', 'Quality assurance', 'Queuetime prediction model', 'Time-constraints']",,"This paper proposes a machine learning based method to predict the ‘queue-time’ of a target lot with time-constraints among processing steps. Since time-constraints among processing steps exist for quality assurance, it is very important to meet the time-constraints in Fab operations. To do so, we need to have an accurate prediction model for the ‘queue-time’ of a target lot. This paper identifies two categories of predictor variables; 1) work-in-process related variables, and 2) dispatching rule related variables. Since the quality of the prediction model depends on the quality of predictor variables, we need to carefully select predictor variables by considering their explanatory powers and multi-collinearities among them. In this paper, we employ the genetic algorithm for the section of best predictor variables. The prediction model is a fully-connected deep learning model, and the demonstration shows the performance of the model."

An adversarial example is an attack sample that causes the neural network to recognize it incorrectly by adding minimal noise to the original sample. However, the disadvantage is that it takes a long time to generate such an adversarial example. Therefore, in some cases, an attack may be necessary that quickly causes the neural network to recognize it incorrectly. In this paper, we propose a fast misclassification sample that can rapidly attack neural networks. The proposed method does not consider the distortion of the original sample when adding noise. We used MNIST and CIFAR10 as experimental data and Tensorflow as a machine learning library. Experimental results show that the fast misclassification sample generated by the proposed method can be generated with 50% and 80% reduced number of iterations for MNIST and CIFAR10, respectively, compared to the conventional Carlini method, and has 100% attack rate."

Since the decision tree-based methods are greatly influenced by the number of data, SVM regression predicted optimum cutter spacing ratio according to the penetration depth more accurately and it is judged that the SVM regression will be effectively used to decide the cutter spacing when designing the cutter head if a large amount of data of the optimum cutter spacing ratio according to the penetration depth is accumulated."

A number of research on various topics about structural engineering was performed by using artificial neural networks, such as structural design optimization, vibration control and system identification etc. When nonlinear semi-active structural control devices are applied to building structure, a lot of computational effort is required to predict dynamic structural responses of finite element method (FEM) model for development of control algorithm. To solve this problem, an artificial neural network model was developed in this study. Among various deep learning algorithms, a recurrent neural network (RNN) was used to make the time history response prediction model. An RNN can retain state from one iteration to the next by using its own output as input for the next step. An eleven-story building structure with semi-active tuned mass damper (TMD) was used as an example structure. The semi-active TMD was composed of magnetorheological damper. Five historical earthquakes and five artificial ground motions were used as ground excitations for training of an RNN model. Another artificial ground motion that was not used for training was used for verification of the developed RNN model. Parametric studies on various hyper-parameters including number of hidden layers, sequence length, number of LSTM cells, etc. After appropriate training iteration of the RNN model with proper hyper-parameters, the RNN model for prediction of seismic responses of the building structure with semi-active TMD was developed. The developed RNN model can effectively provide very accurate seismic responses compared to the FEM model."

In addition,the model is influenced by its inherent uncertainty in describing a system’s behavior of interest. In order for a machine learning model to bereliable, its prediction performance as well as uncertainty must be quantified together. Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) is a useful tool todescribe stochastic characteristics of deep learning models by estimating distributions of the models’ weights. Model uncertainty in BNN canbe classified into epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. Epistemic uncertainty is caused by lack of data or knowledge. In contrast, aleatoricuncertainty is caused by outliers or noises inherent in training data and can be reduced by removing abnormal data from the training dataset.In this study, the BNN models were developed for a compression chiller in an existing office building with BEMS data, and then epistemicand aleatoric uncertainties were analyzed. It is found that both uncertainties are significant in the simulation model even though the model’saccuracy is satisfactory with the CVRMSE of less than 15%. It is suggested that before attempting to apply the machine learning model toreal applications, the both uncertainties must be carefully analyzed.

However, the project model which fails to reflect the original characteristics of the area as it divides project area into five categories: Our Neighborhood Restoration, Housing Maintenance Support Type, General Neighborhood Type, Central Urban Type, and Economic Base Type, According to keywords for successful urban regeneration in Korea, resident participation, regional specialization, ministerial cooperation and public-private cooperation”, when local governments propose urban regeneration projects to the government, they can see that it is most important to accurately understand the characteristics of the city and push ahead with the projects in a way that suits the characteristics of the city with the help of local residents and private companies. In addition, considering the gentrification problem, which is one of the side effects of urban regeneration projects, it is important to select and implement urban regeneration types suitable for the characteristics of the area.

There are four types of urban regeneration in Seoul: Low-use Low-Level Development, Abandonment, Deteriorated Housing, and Specialization of Historical and Cultural Resources (Shon and Park, 2017).  In order to identify regional characteristics, approximately 100,000 text data were collected for 22 regions where the project was carried out for a total of four types of urban regeneration. Using the collected data, we drew key keywords for each region according to the type of urban regeneration and conducted topic modeling to explore whether there were differences between types. As a result, it was confirmed that a number of topics related to real estate and economy appeared in old residential areas, and in the case of declining and underdeveloped areas, topics reflecting the characteristics of areas where industrial activities were active in the past appeared. In the case of the historical and cultural resource area, since it is an area that contains traces of the past, many keywords related to the government appeared. Therefore, it was possible to confirm political topics and cultural topics resulting from various events. Finally, in the case of low-use and under-developed areas, many topics on real estate and accessibility are emerging, so accessibility is good. It mainly had the characteristics of a region where development is planned or is likely to be developed.  Furthermore, a model was implemented that proposes urban regeneration types tailored to regional characteristics for regions other than Seoul.

This paper investigates the history of how the media has misunderstood this term. While the term “internal reserve amount” first appeared in a 1933 article, the last fifteen years have seen it become widely (misused and) misunderstood. In this study, we collect news articles printed between 2010 and 2019 and find that the progressive media had published significantly more articles mentioning “internal reserve amount” than the conservative media. The difference in misuse rates, however, is not significant. For a large-scale analysis, we examine the articles containing the term and apply K-Means clustering (machine learning methodology) to classify them into two groups. We find that the difference in the use of sensationalistic words is statistically significant between the two media groups, indicating systematic differences in the use of sensationalistic words by press. We further find that the number of sensationalized feelings among readers and the use of offensive language in the comment sections are higher for groups with more sensationalistic words. Such differences in reader reactions imply that words used in press articles may stimulate social conflicts concerning the “internal reserve amount”. Overall, as the first study for the media coverage of “internal reserve amount” using machine learning technology, this study shows that the misuse of words by media may increase social conflict surrounding business environment."
"뇌연령, 새로운 신경병리 지표",2020,"['brain age', 'MRI', 'machine learning']",,"The human brain undergoes aging throughout one’s lifetime after its maturation period. However, the patterns of brain aging vary from person to person. Recently, the brain age prediction brings our attention increasingly since it may be useful as a biological marker of the level of brain aging. Estimation of brain age is of great clinical significances, since it can suggest the severity of neurological diseases as well as psychiatric disorders. It has been reported that regional volumes of cerebral structures and cortical thickness would be decreased with aging. Yet, these changes vary depending on numerous factors such as tissue and area of the brain aging and accelerate after a certain period of time. In order to establish brain age prediction algorithms with high accuracy, it is necessary to select relevant input data and algorithms. Majority of the previous studies trained the models through volume-based data and in particular, the study applying the latest prediction algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks, has shown reasonably high accuracy with a mean absolute error of around 4 years. Growing body of literatures regarding the brain age prediction has been available since 2015. In the future, more accurate model will be developed with more advanced machine learning and larger number of brain imaging data. If the model would be developed for younger population, its clinical significance will be increased."

This recommendation service requires a high level of technology from developers developing e-commerce, so it is developed by a specific artificial intelligence engineer or applied by introducing an external recommendation solution. Integration of recommended services by external solutions or external development companies cannot satisfy the requirements of e-commerce services to be developed, and cannot provide rapid maintenance due to frequent data changes. Accordingly, research on a generalized development platform for generalizing and providing recommendation services suitable for a specific domain or developing a recommendation service is being actively conducted. Amazon Personalize service and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning service are generalized tools for developing recommended services by developers. However, these recommendation model development tools have a workload of defining essential data information for training data required to generate a recommendation model. In this paper, we derive a learning algorithm without defining data by using an association analysis algorithm between data for analyzing learning data. Also, based on the derived learning algorithm, we propose an Open API for developing and verifying a recommendation model. In the experiment, the learning algorithm is derived and the open API is verified by using the open transaction data of the e-commerce transaction. Through this, the suitability of the open architecture of the recommendation model development platform is verified."

Long-term exposure to SO2 can result in a negative effect on the human body causing respiratory or cardiovascular disease, which makes the effective and continuous monitoring of SO2 crucial. In South Korea, SO2 monitoring at ground stations has been performed, but this does not provide spatially continuous information of SO2 concentrations. Thus, this research estimated spatially continuous ground-level SO2 concentrations at 1 km resolution over South Korea through the synergistic use of satellite data and numerical models. A stacking ensemble approach, fusing multiple machine learning algorithms at two levels (i.e., base and meta), was adopted for ground-level SO2 estimation using data from January 2015 to April 2019. Random forest and extreme gradient boosting were used as based models and multiple linear regression was adopted for the meta-model. The cross-validation results showed that the metamodel produced the improved performance by 25% compared to the base models, resulting in the correlation coefficient of 0.48 and root-mean-square-error of 0.0032 ppm. In addition, the temporal transferability of the approach was evaluated for one-year data which were not used in the model development. The spatial distribution of ground-level SO2 concentrations based on the proposed model agreed with the general seasonality of SO2 and the temporal patterns of emission sources."

This study is about the prediction of ultrafine dust concentration, and it attempts to predict the middle (after 1 week) prediction while most of the existing studies are only short-term (after 1 hour to 2 days) prediction. A classification model was develeped to predict the average daily ultrafine dust concentration in Seoul by dividing it into two stages: normal (less than 36) and bad (more than 36). XGBoost was used as the classification model and an ensemble model was constructed after creating individual models through the hyperparameter optimization based on different evaluation indicators in order to maximize the performance of the model. The average daily fine dust concentration in Seoul from January to June 2019 was predicted after training the model using data from 2016 to 2018, and the performance of the ensemble model presented in this study was higher than that of a single model. In addition, the method of imbalance problem was applied since the number of cases where the level of fine dust is bad is much less than the number of cases where the level of fine dust is normal. It works effectively when only environmental material data is used as explanatory variables, but it adversely affects the performance of the model when both variables related to environmental materials and weather information are used."

In this paper, we propose various machine learning approach for diagnosing the abnormal operation of a gas pressure regulator with only the flow rate and gas pressure data collected from a gas pressure regulator itself. Since the fault data of a gas pressure regulator is not enough, the model is trained in all classes by applying the over-sampling method.

The device consists of a pair of gloves. One measures finger positions of the normal side, and the other induces symmetric movements on the affected side by pneumatic force. Ten patients at Brunnstrom stage 3 and 4 from a local hospital participated in this study. They performed Rolyan Stacking Cones 10 times with and without the support of the soft robot. We measured subjects’ proximal interphalangeal angles and air pressures in the pneumatic glove during the exercise to monitor grab/release patterns. The soft robot helped open their paralyzed finger joints by more than 50 degrees on average regardless of Brunnstrom stages. We applied pattern recognition methods on the measurement to quantitatively evaluate the subjects. A support vector machine revealed a misclassification rate of 20%, implying that there were a considerable number of overlapping data sets near the boundary between Brunnstrom stages. K-means method with three clusters suggested a new subject group near the support vector machine border. Thus, we conclude that our wearable soft robot not only provides grab/release guides to post-stroke patients but also provides quantitative information on their finger paralysis supplementary to the existing qualitative assessments."

The cultural tourism festivals are selected for the best festivals through peer reviews by tourism experts. However, only 10% of the festivals which are held in a year could be evaluated in the view of effectiveness without considering the efficiency of festivals.Design/methodology/approach: Efficiency scores were derived from the results of DEA for the prediction of efficiency ratings. This study utilized BCC models to reflect the size effect of festivals and classified the festivals into four ratings according the efficiency scores. Multi-classification method were considered to build the prediction of four ratings for the festivals in this study. We utilized neural networks and SVMs with OAO(one-against-one), OAR(one-against-rest), C&S(crammer & singer) with Korea festival data from 2013 to 2018.Findings: The number of total visitors in low efficient rating of DEA is more larger than the number of total visitors in high efficient ratings although the total expenditure of visitors is the highest in the most efficient rating when we analyzed the results of DEA for the characteristics of four ratings. SVM with OAO model showed the most superior performance in accuracy as SVM with OAR model was not trained well because of the imbalanced distribution between efficient rating and the other ratings. Our approach could predict the efficiency of festivals which were not included in the review process of culture tourism festivals without rebuilding DEA models each time. This enables us to manage the festivals efficiently with the proposed machine learning models."

The rule-based method requires specialized knowledge and hard to respond frequent design modification of products quickly. Therefore, the usefulness of feature extraction by rule-based method is limited. To cover this limitation, this paper provides a framework to detect defect using CNN model.

Word2Vec을 활용한 제품군별 시장규모 추정 방법에 관한 연구,2020,"['Word2Vec', '기계학습', '텍스트 마이닝', '시장규모 추정', '시장분석', 'machine learning', 'text mining', 'market size estimation', 'market analysis']",,"With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, various techniques have been developed to extract meaningful information from unstructured text data which constitutes a large portion of big data. Over the past decades, text mining technologies have been utilized in various industries for practical applications. In the field of business intelligence, it has been employed to discover new market and/or technology opportunities and support rational decision making of business participants.  The market information such as market size, market growth rate, and market share is essential for setting companies’ business strategies. There has been a continuous demand in various fields for specific product level-market information. However, the information has been generally provided at industry level or broad categories based on classification standards, making it difficult to obtain specific and proper information.  In this regard, we propose a new methodology that can estimate the market sizes of product groups at more detailed levels than that of previously offered. We applied Word2Vec algorithm, a neural network based semantic word embedding model, to enable automatic market size estimation from individual companies’ product information in a bottom-up manner. The overall process is as follows: First, the data related to product information is collected, refined, and restructured into suitable form for applying Word2Vec model. Next, the preprocessed data is embedded into vector space by Word2Vec and then the product groups are derived by extracting similar products names based on cosine similarity calculation. Finally, the sales data on the extracted products is summated to estimate the market size of the product groups. As an experimental data, text data of product names from Statistics Koreas microdata (345,103 cases) were mapped in multidimensional vector space by Word2Vec training. We performed parameters optimization for training and then applied vector dimension of 300 and window size of 15 as optimized parameters for further experiments. We employed index words of Korean Standard Industry Classification (KSIC) as a product name dataset to more efficiently cluster product groups. The product names which are similar to KSIC indexes were extracted based on cosine similarity. The market size of extracted products as one product category was calculated from individual companies’ sales data. The market sizes of 11,654 specific product lines were automatically estimated by the proposed model. For the performance verification, the results were compared with actual market size of some items. The Pearsons correlation coefficient was 0.513.  Our approach has several advantages differing from the previous studies. First, text mining and machine learning techniques were applied for the first time on market size estimation, overcoming the limitations of traditional sampling based- or multiple assumption required-methods. In addition, the level of market category can be easily and efficiently adjusted according to the purpose of information use by changing cosine similarity threshold. Furthermore, it has a high potential of practical applications since it can resolve unmet needs for detailed market size information in public and private sectors. Specifically, it can be utilized in technology evaluation and technology commercialization support program conducted by governmental institutions, as well as business strategies consulting and market analysis report publishing by private firms.  The limitation of our study is that the presented model needs to be improved in terms of accuracy and reliability. The semantic-based word embedding module can be advanced by giving a proper order in the preprocessed dataset or by combining another algorithm such as Jaccard similarity with Word2Vec. Also, the methods of product group clustering can be changed to other types of unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Our gro"

This study predicted the remaining useful life (RUL) of aeroengine using degradation data collected by sensors provided by the IEEE 2008 PHM Conference Challenge. There are 218 engine sensor data that has initial wear and production deviations. It was difficult to determine the characteristics of the engine parts since the system and domain-specific information was not provided. Each engine has a different cycle, making it difficult to use time series models. Therefore, this analysis was performed using machine learning algorithms rather than statistical time series models. The machine learning algorithms used were a random forest, gradient boost tree analysis and XG boost. A sliding window was applied to develop RUL predictions. We compared model performance before and after applying the sliding window, and proposed a data preprocessing method to develop RUL predictions. The model was evaluated by R-square scores and root mean squares error (RMSE). It was shown that the XG boost model of the random split method using the sliding window preprocessing approach has the best predictive performance."

However, the optimal algorithm for classifying individual land cover types differs significantly depending on the land cover type. For example, the KNN classifier is superior to the SVM classifier in classifying human-made facilities and roads.

Experimental results demonstrate that they improve upon current state-of-the-art NER approaches for Urdu. The DRRN models evaluated include forward and bidirectional extensions of the long short-term memory and back propagation through time approaches. The proposed models consider both language-dependent features, such as part-of-speech tags, and language-independent features, such as the ""context windows"" of words. The effectiveness of the DRNN models with word embedding for NER in Urdu is demonstrated using three datasets. The results reveal that the proposed approach significantly outperforms previous conditional random field and artificial neural network approaches. The best f-measure values achieved on the three benchmark datasets using the proposed deep learning approaches are 81.1%, 79.94%, and 63.21%, respectively."

Two Local States of Ambient Water,2020,"['Water Anomaly', 'Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation', 'Widom Delta', 'Machine Learning']",,"The non-monotonic trends of thermodynamic response functions have long been a mystery of water. The idea, that water may be a mixture of two local states, came out more than a century ago to explain the origin of the non-monotonic behaviors. Recently, this idea is materialized through the hypothesis of the second critical point of water and then the anomalies are outcomes of critical fluctuation. Although the typical macroscopic heterogeneity (Widom line) of critical fluctuation stays in the vicinity of the critical point, as we have previously shown that the microscopic heterogeneity is identified far from it which extends the linear heterogeneity, the Widom line, to the areal one as a Widom Delta.With this background, we search for two local states of the ambient water. Distinct states in ambient condition are not to be contrasted by a single strong feature such as density but they are expressed by a combination of weak features that reflects locally correlated structures. In this work, we identify the formation of local bicontinuous micro-domain formations of water attributing its softness by using machine learning order parameters. Interestingly, the radial distribution functions are similar to two phases in the liquid-liquid phase transition and they are well fitted by the two-state model. The hard-label domain is dominant at a lower temperature but changes its label to a more fluctuating soft-label domain at high temperature. There exist crossover behaviors around 310-320 K. At sufficiently high temperatures, near the liquid-gas phase transition, all water molecules become homogeneous."

Second, an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm is proposed to determine the optimal hybrid kernel function for improved kernel principal component analysis (IKPCA). Finally, IKPCA is conducted to complete feature extraction, and an extreme learning machine (ELM) is applied to classify common attack type detection. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the constructed hybrid kernel function.

Fault Diagnosis of Marine Turbocharger System Based on an Unsupervised Algorithm,2020,['Fault diagnosis · Unsupervised algorithm · One-class support vector machine · Afnity propagation · Gaussian mixture model'],,"The fault diagnosis of a marine turbocharger system is very crucial for realizing intelligent operation and maintenance in a big data analysis context. In order to improve the diagnostic rate of faults in engineering applications, in this paper, a new unsupervised machine learning algorithm, which is based on one-class support vector machine (OSVM), afnity propagation (AP) and Gaussian mixture model (GMM), called OAGFD is proposed for fault diagnosis. OSVM was frstly used to divide samples of marine turbocharger system into normal and fault samples, and only the fault samples are used in following steps to identify specifc fault types. The AP was adopted automatically to provide an initial value for expectation maximization, which can obtain the maximum value of iteration parameters. The GMM is used to classify faults of marine turbocharger system and output the fault diagnosis results. Finally, the OAGFD is validated by actual data. The experiment results show that OAGFD can quickly and accurately be trained. The OAGFD method can achieve higher identifcation accuracy for multi-faults of marine turbocharger system and takes on faster operation speed and stronger generalization ability than tradition methods.

To do so, we first selected the most related features from the individual cows’ historical information by using the Pearson correlation and next applied Naïve Bayes, artificial neural networks, random forests, logistic regression, decision trees, kNN, and SVM methods. As the result of their accuracy by comparison with prediction results, the kNN method was demonstrated to have the highest accuracy at 97.2%.

Rapid Process Modeling of the Aerosol Jet Printing Based on Gaussian Process Regression with Latin Hypercube Sampling,2020,['3D printing · Aerosol jet process · Gaussian process regression · Machine learning · Process modeling'],,"Aerosol jet printing (AJP) technology is a relatively new 3D printing technology for producing customized microelectronic components due to its high design flexibility and fine feature deposition. However, complex interactions between machine, process parameters and materials will influence line morphology and remain a challenge on modeling effectively. And the system drift which induced by many changing and uncertain factors will affect the printing process significantly. Hence, it is necessary to develop a small data set based machine learning approach to model relationship between the process parameters and the line morphology. In this paper, we propose a rapid process modeling method for AJP process and consider sheath gas flow rate, carrier gas flow rate, stage speed as AJP process parameters, and line width and line roughness as the line morphology. Latin hypercube sampling is adopted to generate experimental points. And, Gaussian process regression (GPR) is used for modeling the AJP process because GPR has the capability of providing the prediction uncertainty in terms of variance. The experimental result shows that the proposed GPR model has competitive modeling accuracy comparing to the other regression models."

Mnet is categorized as penalized regression among machine learning techniques, and deals with the inconsistency and multicollinearity problems of LASSO and MCP, respectively. Group Mnet also handles categorical variables. Specifically, this study repeated 100 times of model building after random data-splitting, and 42 variables were selected out of 301 after selection counts. Variables measuring academic lethargy, life satisfaction, happiness, creative personality, health status, parenting style, gender, and relationships with friends as well as teachers had been investigated in previous research, and were also selected in this study. Newly found variables included predictors relating to self-esteem, cooperation, depression, attention, aggression, smartphone usage, and fandom activities.

Tumors were semi-automatically segmented on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images registered to T2-weighted images, and radiomic features (n=202) were extracted from contrast-enhanced T1- and T2-weighted images. The radiomics classifier was built using elastic-net regularized generalized linear model analyses with nested five-fold cross-validation. The diagnostic abilities of the radiomics classifier and visual assessment by two head and neck radiologists were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses for distinguishing SCC from lymphoma. Nineteen radiomics features were selected at least twice during the five-fold cross-validation. The mean area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the radiomics classifier was 0.750 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.613–0.887], with a sensitivity of 84.2%, specificity of 60.3%, and an accuracy of 65.5%. Two human readers yielded AUCs of 0.613 (95% CI, 0.467–0.759) and 0.663 (95% CI, 0.531–0.795), respectively.

For this end, FCT, Korean version of MMSE for Dementia Screening (MMSE-DS) and Clock Drawing Test were administrated to a total of 270 participants from normal and damaged elderly groups. Results demonstrated that FCT scores showed high internal constancy and significant correlation coefficients with the other two test scores. Discriminant analyses showed that the accuracy of classification for the normal and damaged groups using FCT were 90.8% and 77.1%, respectively, and these were relatively higher than the other two tests. Importantly, we identified that the participants whose MMSE-DS scores were higher than the cutoff but showed lower scores in FCT were successfully screened out through clinical diagnosis.

It was found that the feature [±back] is one of the primary features that differentiates vowel classes and the feature [±high] is used in subsequent separations of the vowel classes. It was also found that high confusability in the perception of vowels is attributable to overlapping distributions of the samples.

Therefore, analyzing and predicting the habitats of biological indicator species are crucial to understanding the distribution shift and planning biological conservation. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel ensemble model to predict the habitat distribution changes of three biological indicator species, including Taxus cuspidata, Abies koreana, and Abies nephrolepis, under climate change scenarios. More specifically, we constructed an ensemble-based species distribution model by combining several machine learning models. The prediction accuracy of our model was 0.9 or higher based on the True Skill Statistic (TSS), which is superior to other existing models. We also identified the environmental factors that have a significant effect on species distribution through variable importance analysis, and analyzed the distribution changes according to different climate change scenarios. Finally, we visualized the distribution of the species in 2050 and 2070, based on representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. Through this study, we expect that our model can be used to make plans for the conservation of Taxus cuspidata, Abies koreana, and Abies nephrolepis according to future climate change."

A semi-automated method for integrating textural and material data into as-built BIM using TIS,2020,"['As-Built BIM', 'building materials', 'thermal infrared imaging', 'thermography', 'texture extraction', 'feature technology', 'information visualization', 'machine learning']",,"Building Information Modeling (BIM) is increasingly used throughout the facility's life cycle for various applications, such as design, construction, facility management, and maintenance. For existing buildings, the geometry of as-built BIM is often constructed using dense, three dimensional (3D) point clouds data obtained with laser scanners. Traditionally, as-built BIM systems do not contain the material and textural information of the buildings' elements. This paper presents a semi-automatic method for generation of material and texture rich as-built BIM. The method captures and integrates material and textural information of building elements into as-built BIM using thermal infrared sensing (TIS). The proposed method uses TIS to capture thermal images of the interior walls of an existing building. These images are then processed to extract the interior walls using a segmentation algorithm. The digital numbers in the resulted images are then transformed into radiance values that represent the emitted thermal infrared radiation. Machine learning techniques are then applied to build a correlation between the radiance values and the material type in each image. The radiance values were used to extract textural information from the images. The extracted textural and material information are then robustly integrated into the as-built BIM providing the data needed for the assessment of building conditions in general including energy efficiency, among others."

However, most researches have proceeded without any explicit verification of the prediction rate of the learning data. In this study, we conducted an experiment to determine the degree of market prediction ability of basic indicators, technical indicators, and system risk indicators (AR) used in stock price prediction. First, we set the core parameters for each financial indicator and define the objective function reflecting the return and volatility. Then, an experiment was performed to extract the sample from the distribution of each parameter by the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and to find the optimum value to maximize the objective function. Since Robo Advisor is a commodity that trades financial instruments such as stocks and funds, it can not be utilized only by forecasting the market index. The sample for this experiment is data of 17 years of 1,500 stocks that have been listed in Korea for more than 5 years after listing. As a result of the experiment, it was possible to establish a meaningful trading strategy that exceeds the market return. This study can be utilized as a basis for the development of Robo Advisor products in that it includes a large proportion of listed stocks in Korea, rather than an experiment on a single index, and verifies market predictability of various financial indicators."

Defects on the surface of railroads are caused by various factors such as friction between track binding devices and adjacent tracks and can cause accidents such as broken rails [14], so railroad maintenance for defects is necessary. Therefore, various researches on defect detection and inspection using image processing or machine learning on railway surface images have been conducted to automate railroad inspection and to reduce railroad maintenance costs. In general, the performance of the image processing analysis method and machine learning technology is affected by the quantity and quality of data. For this reason, some researches require specific devices or vehicles to acquire images of the track surface at regular intervals to obtain a database of various railway surface images [15, 16]. On the contrary, in this study, in order to reduce and improve the operating cost of image acquisition, we constructed the 'Defective Railroad Surface Regeneration Model' by applying the methods presented in the related studies of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) [1]. Thus, we aimed to detect defects on railroad surface even without a dedicated database. This constructed model is designed to learn to generate the railroad surface combining the different railroad surface textures and the original surface, considering the ground truth of the railroad defects. The generated images of the railroad surface were used as training data in defect detection network [2], which is based on Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) [3]. To validate its performance, we clustered and divided the railroad data into three subsets, one subset as original railroad texture images and the remaining two subsets as another railroad surface texture images. In the first experiment, we used only original texture images for training sets in the defect detection model. And in the second experiment, we trained the generated images that were generated by combining the original images with a few railroad textures of the other images. Each defect detection model was evaluated in terms of 'intersection of union(IoU)' and F1-score measures with ground truths. As a result, the scores increased by about 10~15% when the generated images were used, compared to the case that only the original images were used. This proves that it is possible to detect defects by using the existing data and a few different texture images, even for the railroad surface images in which dedicated training database is not constructed."

Because AI education has become increasingly crucial, we examined the perceptions of teachers who are the primary focus of education and suggested future directions for AI education.We developed a set of 10 questions focusing on AI education and surveyed elementary and middle school teachers who completed the AI education training. The survey results are as follows: First, teachers recognized AI education for cultivating the ability to “utilize artificial intelligence in life.” Moreover, AI education answered in the order of learning AI concept and education converging to industry. Teachers perceived it as the primary goal of AI education to learn to use AI in other subjects, or integrate it into a problem-solving process. Second, teachers noted a complementary relationship between AI and software education, and the relationships among the concepts, principles, utilization, and convergence of AI. Third, the introduction of AI education was somewhat positive for elementary school students and very positive for middle and high school students. Compared with secondary school teachers, elementary school teachers showed increasingly positive attitudes toward elementary school introduction. Fourth, teachers recognized AI in the order of “human-like intelligence,” “learning machine,” “auxiliary tool (convenient tool),” “big data,” and “new science and technology.” Fifth, teachers responded to the applications of AI education in the order of “individual teaching assistant tools,” “real life convergence education,” “artificial intelligence concept learning,” “language utilization education,” and “programming education.” Sixth, teachers selected “Algorithm Judgment and Responsibility,” “Human Dignity,” “Good Artificial Intelligence,” “Artificial Intelligence Society Conflict,” and “Personal Information and Privacy” as the contents of AI ethics education. We anticipate that the current study results will help to set the direction for AI education in the future, and that AI will be used effectively in primary and secondary education."
Brain tumor diagnostic model and dietary effect based on extracellular vesicle microbiome data in serum,2020,,,"The human microbiome has been recently associated with human health and disease. Brain tumors (BTs) are a particularly difficult condition to directly link to the microbiome, as microorganisms cannot generally cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB). However, some nanosized extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from microorganisms can cross the BBB and enter the brain. Therefore, we conducted metagenomic analysis of microbial EVs in both serum (152 BT patients and 198 healthy controls (HC)) and brain tissue (5 BT patients and 5 HC) samples based on the V3–V4 regions of 16S rDNA. We then developed diagnostic models through logistic regression and machine learning algorithms using serum EV metagenomic data to assess the ability of various dietary supplements to reduce BT risk in vivo. Models incorporating the stepwise method and the linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) method yielded 12 and 29 significant genera as potential biomarkers, respectively. Models using the selected biomarkers yielded areas under the curves (AUCs) >0.93, and the model using machine learning resulted in an AUC of 0.99. In addition, Dialister and [Eubacterium] rectale were significantly lower in both blood and tissue samples of BT patients than in those of HCs. In vivo tests showed that BT risk was decreased through the addition of sorghum, brown rice oil, and garlic but conversely increased by the addition of bellflower and pear. In conclusion, serum EV metagenomics shows promise as a rich data source for highly accurate detection of BT risk, and several foods have potential for mitigating BT risk."
Frequency spectra characterization of noncoding human genomic sequences,2020,['Human genome\xa0· ENCODE\xa0· Genomic signal processing\xa0· Spectral classifcation\xa0· Noncoding sequence Fourier analysis'],,"Background Noncoding sequences have been demonstrated to possess regulatory functions. Its classifcation is challenging because they do not show well-defned nucleotide patterns that can correlate with their biological functions. Genomic signal processing techniques like Fourier transform have been employed to characterize coding and noncoding sequences. This transformation in a systematic whole-genome noncoding library, such as the ENCODE database, can provide evidence of a periodic behaviour in the noncoding sequences that correlates with their regulatory functions. Objective The objective of this study was to classify diferent noncoding regulatory regions through their frequency spectra. Methods We computed machine learning algorithms to classify the noncoding regulatory sequences frequency spectra. Results The sequences from diferent regulatory regions, cell lines, and chromosomes possessed distinct frequency spectra, and that machine learning classifers (such as those of the support vector machine type) could successfully discriminate among regulatory regions, thus correlating the frequency spectra with their biological functions Conclusion Our work supports the idea that there are patterns in the noncoding sequences of the genome."

In this paper, we propose a malware analysis method based on string information that can be used regardless of operating system environment and represents library call information related to malicious behavior. Attackers can easily create malware using existing code or by using automated authoring tools, and the generated malware operates in a similar way to existing malware. Since most of the strings that can be extracted from malicious code are composed of information closely related to malicious behavior, it is processed by weighting data features using text mining based method to extract them as effective features for malware analysis. Based on the processed data, a model is constructed using various machine learning algorithms to perform experiments on detection of malicious status and classification of malicious groups. Data has been compared and verified against all files used on Windows and Linux operating systems. The accuracy of malicious detection is about 93.5%, the accuracy of group classification is about 90%. The proposed technique has a wide range of applications because it is relatively simple, fast, and operating system independent as a single model because it is not necessary to build a model for each group when classifying malicious groups. In addition, since the string information is extracted through static analysis, it can be processed faster than the analysis method that directly executes the code."

인공지능(AI) 기반 지능정보사회 시대의 노동시장 변화: 경제사회학적 접근을 중심으로,2020,"['4차 산업혁명', '지능정보사회', '인공지능', '노동시장', 'Fourth Industrial Revolution', 'intelligence information society', 'artificial intelligence', 'labor market']","최근 지능정보기술을 접목한 디지털 변혁(Digital Transformation)이 빠르게 확산되면서 인공지능(AI) 기반의 다양한 지능형 정보시스템이 사회 가치를 창출해내는 지능정보사회로 변 모해가고 있다. 지능정보사회에서는 인공지능(AI) 기반의 지능형 시스템의 도입이 단순업무 뿐만 아니라 고차원적인 정신노동의 영역까지 확대되면서 노동시장에도 상당한 변화가 예상된다. 이러한 지능정보사회에서의 핵심인 인공지능(AI)은 1956년 존 맥커시(John McCarthy)가 미국 다트머스 대학(Dartmouth College)에서 열린 학술대회에서 인공지능(AI)이라는 용어를 사용하면서부터 기계가 생각을 하고 인간과 소통할 수 있는지에 관한 논의에 초점을 두고 관련 연구가 진행됐다. 최근 인공지능(AI)은 4차산업혁명과 함께 학계의 담론을 넘어서 기술혁신에 기반을 둔 산업구조의 변화와 사회변화를 이끌고 있다. 따라서 본 연구에서는 인공지능(AI)의 역사와 개념에 대해 살펴보고, 지능정보기술의 발달로 인한 사회의 변화를 노동시장의 변화에 초점을 맞추어 살펴보고자 한다. 또한, 인공지능이 직무에 어떠한 변화를 가져오고 있는지에 관한 사례들을 통해 노동시장의 변화를 고찰해 보고자 한다. 특히, 지능정보사회를 이끄는 기술발달과 관련하여 기술의 혁신성이나 경제적 합리성에 초점을 맞추는 선행연구와는 달리 인공지능(AI)이 인간과 관계를 맺는 하나의 기술체로 그 사회적 함의가 커지고 있는 시점에서 고용시장과 직업의 변화에 대한 경제사회적 관점에서 체계적으로 고찰할 필요가 있다.  이른바 4차 산업혁명 기술이라고 일컬어지는 인공지능(Artificial Intelligence: AI), 사물인터넷(Internet of Things: IoT), 3D 프린팅, 로봇, 빅데이터(Big Data), 블록체인(Block Chain), 나노(Nano) 기술과 바이오(Bio) 기술 등 지능정보기술의 발달은 인간의 생활양식과 가치관에 큰 변화를 일으키는 사회적 패러다임의 변화를 가속시키고 있다. 2016년 12월 미래창조과학부(현재의 과학기술정보통신부)에서 발표한 ‘지능정보사회의 중장기 종합대책’에서도 지능정보사회를 언급하면서 새로운 패러다임의 변화에 주목하였다.  인공지능(AI)의 확산에 따른 노동시장의 문제는 낙관론과 비관론이 첨예하게 대립하는 부분이다. 지능정보기술의 발전에 대한 낙관론적인 입장에서 합리성을 강조하며 노동의 생산성 향상과 산업의 효율성 확보라는 시각에서 노동시장의 변화를 바라보는 시각이 있는 반면, 인간과 기술의 상호작용의 변화와 함께 사회변동의 측면에서의 직무변화와 일자리 감소에 대한 우려의 시각이 공존하고 있다. 노동력 대체의 핵심인 자동화는 물리적 근로와 정신적 및 인지적 근로가 인공지능에 의해 대체된다는 것으로, 고용은 물론 산업혁명 이래로 상당한 사회적, 경제적 파장을 가져올 것으로 전망된다. 인공지능(AI) 기술의 발달로 인한 국내의 다양한 산업부문에서 일자리 대체는 피할 수 없는 사회의 변화일 것이다. 이미 많은 단순 반복적 업무에서 인공지능을 활용한 노동비용의 경감은 현실화되고 있으며 일자리 감소와 직무변화에 따른 새로운 유형의 일자리 창출을 위한 재교육 및 적극적인 사회적 지원을 필요성이 대두되고 있다.  인공지능(AI) 기반의 지능정보사회에서는 기존의 노동시장에서 고용과 경제성장에 결정적인 역할을 하였던 제조업이 축소되고 있으며 개방형 소통 플랫폼이 혁신의 중요한 환경으로 사회적 네트워크 속에서의 개방적 혁신을 지향하며 공유경제로 진화해 나가고 있다. 이러한 환경변화와 함께 지능형 시스템의 도입은 분석, 기획, 의사결정 등과 같은 인간의 정신노동 영역을 기술이 대체함으로써 상당한 직무변화가 예상된다. 또한, 인공지능(AI)은 창작도 할 수 있고, 인간의 의사결정과 문제해결에 직접 관여할 수 있을 것이다. 따라서 지능정보사회에서의 기술혁신에 따른 사회 전반의 효율성과 생산성 향상이 향후 노동시장에서의 일자리 감소 및 실업률 상승과 같은 사회문제로 이어지지 않도록 충분한 경제사회적 논의를 활성화할 필요가 있을 것이다. 또한, 지능정보사회에서는 새로운 노동과 일자리 창출도 가능할 것이기 때문에 변화에 저항하기보다는 개인이나 기업이 생존하기 위해서 이러한 시대의 변화를 선도하여 사회 전체의 효율성과 생산성을 제고하면서 시민의 자유와 복지를 보장하는데 인공지능 기술을 활용할 수 있어야 한다. 이와 더불어 지능정보사회에서의 인공지능 기술은 일종의 사회를 규율하는 구조적 힘을 가지면서 기술의 혁신이 사회변동의 핵심요인이 되고 있으며, 이러한 사회변동은 인공지능이 인간과 관계를 맺는 하나의 기술체로서 새로운 관계에서의 인간의 주체적인 역할과 과학기술을 바라보는 새로운 가치체계의 형성이 중요할 것이다. 또한, 기존의 노동과 여가에 대한 인식에 있어서 산업화를 거치며 형성된 노동의 가치에 대한 재해석과 더불어 문화와 여가에 대한 인식의 전환이 필요할 것이다.","With the innovation and diffusion of information technology, the Korean society is currently transforming into the intelligence information society for which various intelligent system may create social values and economic wealth. With the adoption of the artificial intelligence in the intelligence information society, considerable changes are expected in the labor market. Since John McCarthy coined artificial intelligence (AI) at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956, the field of artificial intelligence (AI) research has been carried out, focusing on the development of a machine or system that could think and communicate with humans. Along with the fourth industrial revolution, artificial intelligence (AI) is leading to changes in the industrial structures as well as social changes based on technological innovation. There are challenges for the intelligence information society beyond the discourse in academia. Thus, the purpose of this study is to explore the history and concept of artificial intelligence (AI) focusing on how artificial intelligence will affect labor markets to scrutinize the societal changes due to the development of intelligent information technology. Furthermore, this study describes and provides examples of how artificial intelligence have affected different occupations in the current labor markets. Specifically, to bridge the gap between previous studies which focused on innovation or rationality of the technological development, this study focuses on its impact on the labor market by exploring changes in the employment structure and job tasks. The development of intelligent information technology, so-called 4th Industrial Revolution Technology such as artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), 3D printing, robot, Big Data, Nano technology and Bio Technology etc., is accelerating the change in the social paradigm that makes a big difference in human lifestyle and values. The advent of intelligence information society is expected to be accompanied by the social paradigm and changes in the labor market. Both optimism and pessimism coexist on the labor issues stemming from the spread of artificial intelligence. Regarding changes in the labor market, an optimistic standpoint on technology supports rationality and efficiency in the industry, whereas there are growing concerns over job changes and job losses. Automation indicates that artificial intelligence and machine learning are gradually taking over human jobs. The current physical, mental and cognitive work may be replaced or reduced, which is expected to have significant social and economic repercussions. Particularly, it is likely to become the main characteristics of occupations that can be replaced by artificial intelligence (AI). In addition, it is predicted that the use of artificial intelligence technology will be complementary tools for human–machine collaboration. The reduction in labor costs using the artificial intelligence is becoming a reality in many tasks and re-education and social support are needed to create new jobs. Therefore, the need for redesigning the direction of education for new jobs, supporting system for improvement of labor quality were suggested. It is necessary to have sufficient discussions so that the efficiency and productivity improvement in society as a whole through technological innovation do not lead to social problems such as job losses and spiking the unemployment rate in the labor market in the near future."

A Study on Face Recognition and Reliability Improvement Using Classification Analysis Technique,2020,"['Machine Learning', 'SVM', 'PCA', 'Classification', 'Face Recognition']",,"In this study, we try to find ways to recognize face recognition more stably and to improve the effectiveness and reliability of face recognition. In order to improve the face recognition rate, a lot of data must be used, but that does not necessarily mean that the recognition rate is improved. Another criterion for improving the recognition rate can be seen that the top/bottom of the recognition rate is determined depending on how accurately or precisely the degree of classification of the data to be used is made. There are various methods for classification analysis, but in this study, classification analysis is performed using a support vector machine (SVM). In this study, feature information is extracted using a normalized image with rotation information, and then projected onto the eigenspace to investigate the relationship between the feature values through the classification analysis of SVM. Verification through classification analysis can improve the effectiveness and reliability of various recognition fields such as object recognition as well as face recognition, and will be of great help in improving recognition rates."

This research builds a classification model and conducted an experiments to classify self-introduction essays into pass or fail using deep learning and decision tree techniques. Real world data were classified using stratified sampling to alleviate the data imbalance problem between passed self-introduction essays and failed essays. Documents were embedded using Doc2Vec method developed from existing Word2Vec, and they were classified using logistic regression analysis. The decision tree model was chosen as a benchmark model, and K-fold cross-validation was conducted for the performance evaluation. As a result of several experiments, the area under curve (AUC) value of PV-DM results better than that of other models of Doc2Vec, i.e., PV-DBOW and Concatenate. Furthmore PV-DM classifies passed essays as well as failed essays, while PV_DBOW can not classify passed essays even though it classifies well failed essays. In addition, the classification performance of the logistic regression model embedded using the PV-DM model is better than the decision tree-based classification model. The implication of the experimental results is that company can reduce the cost of recruiting good d job seekers.

UWB 레이더를 사용한 수면무호흡환자에 대한 비접촉방식 수면효율 및 수면 단계 추정,2020,"['Machine Learning', 'Monitoring', 'Noncontact', 'Sleep Apnea', 'Sleep Efficiency', 'Sleep Stage']",,"This study proposes a method to improve the sleep stage and efficiency estimation of sleep apnea patients using a UWB (Ultra-Wideband) radar. Motion and respiration extracted from the radar signal were used. Respiratory signal disturbances by motion artifacts and irregular respiration patterns of sleep apnea patients are compensated for in the preprocessing stage. Preprocessing calculates the standard deviation of the respiration signal for a shift window of 15 seconds to estimate thresholds for compensation and applies it to the breathing signal. The method for estimating the sleep stage is based on the difference in amplitude of two kinds of smoothed respirations signals. In smoothing, the window size is set to 10 seconds and 34 seconds, respectively. The estimated feature was processed by the k-nearest neighbor classifier and the feature filtering model to discriminate between the sleep periods of the rapid eye movement (REM) and non-rapid eye movement (NREM). The feature filtering model reflects the characteristics of the REM sleep that occur continuously and the characteristics that mainly occur in the latter part of this stage. The sleep efficiency is estimated by using the sleep onset time and motion events. Sleep onset time uses estimated features from the gradient changes of the breathing signal. A motion event was applied based on the estimated energy change in the UWB signal.Sleep efficiency and sleep stage accuracy were assessed with polysomnography. The average sleep efficiency and sleep stage accuracy were estimated respectively to be about 96.3% and 88.8% in 18 sleep apnea subjects."

Auto-colorization method used in Image-to-Image conversion based on GAN has received a lot of attention due to its promising results. In this paper, we present a solution to not only colorize the line art but also transform the low resolution out image to match the resolution of the input image through two generators and frequency separation method. A high frequency components are extracted from the line, then two generators are used to colorize the image in low resolution. The high frequency component is merged with low resolution image to produce the high resolution colorized image. The resolution of fi nal output image matches the resolution of original image while preserving the texture of the input image, whereas the other schemes reduce the output image to 512 pixels. We performed visual and qualitative evaluation using FID, PSNR, and SSIM. The FID Score of the proposed method is better than the base model by about 4 (proposed: 47.87 and base model 51.64). PNSR and SSIM of the high-resolution images are also better than the base model. PSNR and SSIM of base model is 13.01 and 0.72 whereas the proposed is 20.77 and 0.86, respectively."

The structural progressionpattern evaluated by optical coherence tomography guided progression analysis was classified usinghierarchical cluster analysis. The clinical parameters, patterns of structural progression, and visual field (VF)changes were compared among the groups.Results: Three groups were included: stable, progressive peripapillary RNFL thinning without macular GCIPLinvolvement, and progressive thinning of both the peripapillary RNFL and macular GCIPL. The third group,those with progressive peripapillary RNFL and macular GCIPL thinning, showed more progressive peripapillaryRNFL thinning in the inferotemporal area and VF progression in the parafoveal area. Conversely, the 12and 6 o’clock areas were the most common locations of progressive peripapillary RNFL thinning in the groupwithout macular GCIPL involvement.Conclusions: Structural progression patterns of glaucoma can be categorized into three groups. The locationof progressive peripapillary RNFL thinning is associated with progressive macular GCIPL thinning and patternof VF changes in the affected area. Our results indicate that the use of only macular GCIPL analysis is inadequatefor analyzing the structural progression of glaucoma."

Therefore, the process of removing noise must be accompanied at the pre-processing stage of the vibration signal.In this paper, instead of the signal processing filter traditionally used for noise removal, an artificial intelligence-based prediction maintenance system is proposed, which applies a dinoing model that eliminates noise of signals by using an autocoder model based on 1D-CNN, a deep learning non-instructor learning, and classifies abnormal signals and fault modes for signals with which noise has been removed."
Understanding recurrent neural network for texts using English-Korean corpora,2020,"['RNN', 'NLP', 'Seq2Seq', 'Neural Machine Translation', 'Keras']",,"Deep Learning is the most important key to the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI). There are several distinguishable architectures of neural networks such as MLP, CNN, and RNN. Among them, we try to understand one of the main architectures called Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that differs from other networks in handling sequential data, including time series and texts. As one of the main tasks recently in Natural Language Processing (NLP), we consider Neural Machine Translation (NMT) using RNNs. We also summarize fundamental structures of the recurrent networks, and some topics of representing natural words to reasonable numeric vectors. We organize topics to understand estimation procedures from representing input source sequences to predict target translated sequences. In addition, we apply multiple translation models with Gated Recurrent Unites (GRUs) in Keras on English-Korean sentences that contain about 26,000 pairwise sequences in total from two different corpora, colloquialism and news. We verified some crucial factors that influence the quality of training. We found that loss decreases with more recurrent dimensions and using bidirectional RNN in the encoder when dealing with short sequences. We also computed BLEU scores which are the main measures of the translation performance, and compared them with the score from Google Translate using the same test sentences. We sum up some difficulties when training a proper translation model as well as dealing with Korean language. The use of Keras in Python for overall tasks from processing raw texts to evaluating the translation model also allows us to include some useful functions and vocabulary libraries as well."

The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparing with existing methods, which are Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Convolution Neural Network (CNN). The experiments show that the proposed approach achieves satisfactory results with less computational complexity."

However, the majority of speech recognition systems on the market are developed on data with limited diversity of speakers and tend to perform well on typical adult speakers only. This is because most of the speech recognition models are generally learned using a speech database obtained from adult males and females. This tends to cause problems in recognizing the speech of the elderly, children and people with dialects well. To solve these problems, it may be necessary to retain big database or to collect a data for applying a speaker adaptation. However, this paper proposes that a new end-to-end speech recognition method consists of an acoustic augmented recurrent encoder and a transformer decoder with linguistic prediction. The proposed method can bring about the reliable performance of acoustic and language models in limited data conditions. The proposed method was evaluated to recognize Korean elderly and children speech with limited amount of training data and showed the better performance compared of a conventional method."

For this end, we may generate highly accurate surrogate models with a multitude of aerodynamic data obtained from wind tunnel tests (WTTs); however, this approach is time-consuming and expensive. Thus, we aim to swiftly predict aerodynamic coefficients via co-Kriging using a few WTT data along with plenty of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data. To demonstrate the excellence of co-Kriging models based on both WTT and CFD data, we first generated two surrogate models: co-Kriging models with CFD data and Kriging models without the CFD data. Afterwards, we carried out numerical validation and examined predictive trends to compare the two different surrogate models. As a result, we found that the co-Kriging models produced more accurate aerodynamic coefficients than the Kriging models thanks to the assistance of CFD data."

Since the industrial sector uses more electricity than any other sectors, the importance of a more precise forecasting model for manufacturing sites has been highlighted to lower the excess energy production. We propose a double encoder-decoder model, which uses two separate encoders and one decoder, in order to adapt both long-term and short-term data for better forecasts. We evaluated our proposed model on our electricity power consumption dataset, which was collected in a manufacturing site of Sehong from January 1st, 2019 to June 30th, 2019 with 1 minute time interval. From the experiment, the double encoder-decoder model marked about 10% reduction in mean absolute error percentage compared to a conventional encoder-decoder model. This result indicates that the proposed model forecasts electricity consumption more accurately on manufacturing sites compared to an encoder-decoder model."

However, k-means struggles to classify datasets without prior knowledge of specific domains. We proposed the repulsive k-means (RK-means) algorithm in a previous study to improve the k-means algorithm, using the repulsive force concept, which allows deleting unnecessary cluster centroids. Accordingly, the RK-means enables to classifying of a dataset without domain knowledge. However, three main problems remain. The RK-means algorithm includes a cluster repulsive force offset, for clusters confined in other clusters, which can cause cluster locking; we were unable to prove RK-means provided optimal convergence in the previous study; and RK-means shown better performance only normalize term and weight. Therefore, this paper proposes the advanced RK-means (ARK-means) algorithm to resolve the RK-means problems. We establish an initialization strategy for deploying cluster centroids and define a metric for the ARK-means algorithm. Finally, we redefine the mass and normalize terms to close to the general dataset. We show ARK-means feasibility experimentally using blob and iris datasets. Experiment results verify the proposed ARK-means algorithm provides better performance than k-means, k’-means, and RK-means."

Post-fall Detection Using ANN Based on Ranking Algorithms,2020,['Post-fall detection · IMU · Machine learning · ANN · Ranking algorithm'],,"The purpose of this study was to develop an accurate and efficient algorithm for post-fall detection. Thirty healthy male subjects were recruited and asked to perform 23 movements, comprising 14 activities of daily living and nine fall motions. The algorithm was developed using the ANN toolbox provided with MATLAB and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data were used to distinguish between fall and non-fall cases. An IMU sensor was located at the center between the left and right anterior superior iliac spines. A total of 32 feature vectors were extracted from 3-axis acceleration and angular velocity signals. Based on the five different ranking algorithms (relief-F, T-score, correlation, Fisher score, and minimum redundancy maximum relevance) used, feature vector subsets comprising the feature vectors were created and subsequently evaluated. Accuracy was compared according to the number of feature vectors constituting the subset, which were based on rank-lists. The results showed that the subset comprising all the feature vectors showed the best accuracy (99.86%), but a similar accuracy could be obtained with a subset comprising fewer feature vectors. The T-score was found to be the most optimal among the five ranking algorithms. Furthermore, T-score with two feature vectors achieved an accuracy of 99.17%.

Methods: We used a longitudinal dataset of hemodialysis patients in Hamadan city between 2013 and 2016. To evaluate the performance of the methods in serum creatinine prediction, the data was divided into two sets of training and testing samples. Then LR, LMM, LS-SVR, and MLS-SVR were fitted. The prediction performance was assessed and compared in terms of mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute prediction error (MAPE), and determination coefficient (R2). Variable importance was calculated using the best model to select the most important predictors. Results: The MLS-SVR outperformed the other methods in terms of the least prediction error; MSE = 1.280, MAE = 0.833, and MAPE = 0.129 for the training set and MSE = 3.275, MAE = 1.319, and MAPE = 0.159 for the testing set.

The Study on Implementation of Crime Terms Classification System for Crime Issues Response,2020,"['Multi-Layer Perceptron', 'Crime', 'Machine Learning', 'Classification', 'NLP']",,"The fear of crime, discussed in the early 1960s in the United States, is a psychological response, such as anxiety or concern about crime, the potential victim of a crime. These anxiety factors lead to the burden of the individual in securing the psychological stability and indirect costs of the crime against the society. Fear of crime is not a good thing, and it is a part that needs to be adjusted so that it cannot be exaggerated and distorted by the policy together with the crime coping and resolution. This is because fear of crime has as much harm as damage caused by criminal act. Eric Pawson has argued that the popular impression of violent crime is not formed because of media reports, but by official statistics. Therefore, the police should watch and analyze news related to fear of crime to reduce the social cost of fear of crime and prepare a preemptive response policy before the people have 'fear of crime'. In this paper, we propose a deep - based news classification system that helps police cope with crimes related to crimes reported in the media efficiently and quickly and precisely. The goal is to establish a system that can quickly identify changes in security issues that are rapidly increasing by categorizing news related to crime among news articles. To construct the system, crime data was learned so that news could be classified according to the type of crime. Deep learning was applied by using Google tensor flow. In the future, it is necessary to continue research on the importance of keyword according to early detection of issues that are rapidly increasing by crime type and the power of the press, and it is also necessary to constantly supplement crime related corpus."
Video smoke detection with block DNCNN and visual change image,2020,"['smoke detection', 'deep learning', 'object detection', 'convolutional neural networks']",,"Smoke detection is helpful for early fire detection. With its large coverage area and low cost, vision-based smoke detection technology is the main research direction of outdoor smoke detection. We propose a two-stage smoke detection method combined with block Deep Normalization and Convolutional Neural Network (DNCNN) and visual change image. In the first stage, each suspected smoke region is detected from each frame of the images by using block DNCNN. According to the physical characteristics of smoke diffusion, a concept of visual change image is put forward in this paper, which is constructed by the video motion change state of the suspected smoke regions, and can describe the physical diffusion characteristics of smoke in the time and space domains. In the second stage, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used to classify the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features of visual change images of the suspected smoke regions, in this way to reduce the false alarm caused by the smoke-like objects such as cloud and fog. Simulation experiments are carried out on two public datasets of smoke. Results show that the accuracy and recall rate of smoke detection are high, and the false alarm rate is much lower than that of other comparison methods."

Therefore, this paper proposed an expression recognition framework based on densely concatenated convolutional neural networks to balance accuracy and latency and apply it to humanoid robots. The techniques of feature reuse and parameter compression in the framework improved the learning ability of the model and greatly reduced the parameters. Experiments showed that the proposed model can reduce tens of times the parameters at the expense of little accuracy."

The reason why artificial intelligence and 3D printing technology are in the spotlight is that the data generated by the technology is in the “digital domain”, but the ripple effects of the data being controlled, modified, improved and developed are useful in creating new value in a variety of industries that are “physical domain”. However, due to the intellectual property law, which failed to respond quickly to the digital information-oriented paradigm in the physical world, which was transformed by the introduction of new technologies, artificial intelligence and 3D printing caused legal gaps and confusion in patent and copyright laws.The reason for this is that the existing legal principles established in the paradigm centered on “human in the physical domain” based on the level of the past technology had limitations in regulating the inventions and creative acts made in a changed environment where the boundaries between the physical and digital worlds blurred. Starting with this awareness, the Intellectual Property Law now needs to explore what needs to be focused on changing from an overly ex post legislative approach to an ex ante approach of how it will affect future market changes and public behavior, using artificial intelligence and 3D printing technologies that bring about innovative changes in the existing paradigm. In particular, legislation from an ex ante perspective will be more important because the impact of the intellectual property law is directly related to the competitiveness and economic growth of related industries. With the advent of new technologies that have led to disruptive innovation, not only the paradigm shift of the intellectual property rights law itself in the traditional attitude and role of jurisprudence, but also the views and perspectives of jurisprudence need to be reformed."

At the genomic level, the principles of living organisms or diseases are very complex, as there are many genes involved, and there is a sophisticated regulatory relationship between the genes. Additionally, various omics participate in the gene expression regulation. Recently, the volume of genome data generated yearly is rapidly increasing because of the decrease in the cost of next-generation sequencing. Various new technologies to measure multi-modal omics from one sample are in active development. In this study we conducted a parametric analysis on colon cancer multi-omics data to observe the effect of the sample number and omics objects on the classification of its four subtypes. Two well known multi-omics integration methods and our in-house built method were used for the analysis. As a result, we found that at least 100 samples and less than 5,000 omics objects were required to achieve a satisfactory subtype classification performance. Three different multi-omics analysis methods were compared."

Unlike previous empirical researches, we focus on the effect of the R&D subsidy distribution pattern to the incentive of the firms participating subsidy competition. We used the firm data constructed by KISTEP linking government R&D subsidy record with financial statements provided by NICE, and applied a Gradient Boosting model to predict R&D subsidy. We found that firms with higher R&D performance and larger R&D investment tend to have higher R&D subsidies, but firms with higher operation profit or total asset turnover rate tend to have lower R&D subsidies. Our results suggest that current government R&D subsidy distribution pattern provides incentive to improve R&D project performance, but not business performance."

However, despite their promise, a limitation lies in the fact that a network’s performance quality is based on the data which it receives. A well-trained network will still have poor performance if the subsequent data supplied to it contains artifacts, out of focus regions, or other visual distortions. Under normal circumstances, images of the same scene captured from differing points of focus, angles, or modalities must be separately analysed by the network, despite possibly containing overlapping information such as in the case of images of the same scene captured from different angles, or irrelevant information such as images captured from infrared sensors which can capture thermal information well but not topographical details. This factor can potentially add significantly to the computational time and resources required to utilize the network without providing any additional benefit. In this study, we plan to explore using image fusion techniques to assemble multiple images of the same scene into a single image that retains the most salient key features of the individual source images while discarding overlapping or irrelevant data that does not provide any benefit to the network. Utilizing this image fusion step before inputting a dataset into the network, the number of images would be significantly reduced with the potential to improve the classification performance accuracy by enhancing images while discarding irrelevant and overlapping regions."

The electrical power system of a vessel consists of one or multiple grids depending on the status (open/closed) of the bus tie. Owing to the complexity of propulsion and electrical power systems, designing the operation method and specifications of the battery onboard the vessel remains a challenge.

In particular, in the existing automatic machining, a number of machining defects and non-processing occur due to tool damage or severe wear, resulting in a decrease in productivity and an increase in quality defect rates. Therefore, it is important to measure and predict tool life. In this paper, -ASVR (-Asymmetric Support Vector Regression), which considers the asymmetry of -tube and the asymmetry of penalties for data out of -tube, was proposed and applied to the tool wear prediction problem. In the case of tool wear, if the predicted value of the tool wear amount is smaller than the actual value (under-estimation), product failure may occur due to tool damage or wear. Therefore, it can be said that -ASVR is suitable because it is necessary to overestimate. It is shown that even when adjusting the asymmetry of -tube and the asymmetry of penalties for data out of -tube, the ratio of the number of data belonging to -tube can be adjusted with .

It is an essential factor for monitoring water balance, drought, crop growth, and climate change. Actual evapotranspiration (AET) corresponds to the consumption of water from the land surface and the necessary amount of water for the land surface. Because the AET is derived from multiplying the crop coefficient by the reference evapotranspiration (ET0), an accurate calculation of the ET0 is required for the AET. To date, many efforts have been made for gridded ET0 to provide multiple products now. This study presents a comparison between the ET0 products such as FAO56- PM, LDAPS, PKNU-NMSC, and MODIS to find out which one is more suitable for the local-scale hydrological and agricultural applications in Korea, where the heterogeneity of the land surface is critical. In the experiment for the period between 2016 and 2019, the daily and 8-day products were compared with the in-situ observations by KMA. The analyses according to the station, year, month, and time-series showed that the PKNU-NMSC product with a successful optimization for Korea was superior to the others, yielding stable accuracy irrespective of space and time. Also, this paper showed the intrinsic characteristics of the FAO56-PM, LDAPS, and MODIS ET0 products that could be informative for other researchers."

Especially, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST is the most widely used satellite-based LST product due to its spatiotemporal coverage (1 km spatial and sub-daily temporal resolutions) and longevity (> 20 years). However, there is an increasing demand for LST products with finer spatial resolution (e.g., 10-250 m) over regions such as urban areas. Therefore, various methods have been proposed to produce high-resolution MODIS-like LST less than 250 m (e.g., 100 m). The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of recent research trends and challenges for the downscaling of MODIS LST. Based on the recent literature survey for the past decade, the downscaling techniques classified into three groups—kernel-driven, fusion-based, and the combination of kernel-driven and fusion-based methods—were reviewed with their pros and cons. Then, five open issues and challenges were discussed: uncertainty in LST retrievals, low thermal contrast, the nonlinearity of LST temporal change, cloud contamination, and model generalization. Future research directions of LST downscaling were finally provided."
Development of a sdms (Self-diagnostic monitoring system) with prognostics for a reciprocating pump system,2020,"['SDMS (self-diagnostic monitoring system)', 'Reciprocating pump', 'Machine learning', 'LR(Logistic regression)', 'ANN (artificial neural network)', 'SVM (support vector machine)', 'Prognosis']",,"In this paper, we consider a SDMS (Self-Diagnostic Monitoring System) for a reciprocating pump for the purpose of not only diagnosis but also prognosis. We have replaced a multi class estimator that selects only the most probable one with a multi label estimator such that we are able to see the state of each of the components. We have introduced a measure called certainty so that we are able to represent the symptom and its state. We have built a flow loop for a reciprocating pump system and presented some results. With these changes, we are not only able to detect both the dominant symptom as well as others but also to monitor how the degree of severity of each component changes. About the dominant ones, we found that the overall recognition rate of our algorithm is about 99.7% which is slightly better than that of the former SDMS. Also, we are able to see the trend and to make a base to find prognostics to estimate the remaining useful life. With this we hope that we have gone one step closer to the final goal of prognosis of SDMS."

In this paper, we propose a novel automated method called adaptive slope of wavelet coefficient counts over various thresholds (ASCOT) to classify patient episodes as seizure waveforms. ASCOT involves extracting the feature matrix by calculating the mean slope of wavelet coefficient counts over various thresholds in each frequency subband. We validated our method using our own database and a public database to avoid overtuning. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieved a reliable and promising accuracy in both our own database (98.93%) and the public database (99.78%). Finally, we evaluated the performance of the method considering various window sizes. In conclusion, the proposed method achieved a reliable seizure detection performance with a short-term window size. Therefore, our method can be utilized to interpret long-term EEG results and detect momentary seizure waveforms in diagnostic systems."

But enough research has not been done to protect the neck. This paper presents an airbag system that recognizes the accident situation with Artifcial Intelligence to protect the driver’s neck area from motorcycle accident situations when driving. In some papers with similar themes, most of them are judged based on a critical point. However, in the case of an accident judgment using the critical point, a malfunction may occur such that the airbag operates when a similar operation is performed, or the airbag does not operate due to failing to pass the critical point at the time of an accident. Artifcial intelligence was used to avoid malfunctions and inconveniences. Artifcial intelligence can solve the problem of malfunction that occurs when it is judged as a critical point and can solve the inconvenience of commercialized products. The CNN presented in this paper can solve these two problems, and the accuracy of accident judgment is as high as 95.75%. Through the MPU 6050 sensor, it operates the airbag by determining the accident situation using the Artifcial Intelligence that was learned in advance through the information on acceleration and angular velocity of the driver’s movements that were measured in real time. To make Artifcial Intelligence learn, the data were collected by dividing several types of accidents on motorcycles. In this paper, the Artifcial Intelligence made by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) method and the Artifcial Intelligence made by Neural Networks (NN) method is compared, and it is confrmed that the performance such as Test Accuracy or Train Accuracy of CNN is better."

An evaluation was carried out on five years of Korean auction data from 2014 to 2018. The performance of the model can be improved by selecting appropriate hyperparameters and be generalized through 10-fold cross-validation.Results: According to the results of comparing the predicted performance based on the RMSE calculated for each fold optimization model, the random forest model predicted the best performance. In particular, the prediction error of the random forest model was about 40% lower than that of the parametric OLS model.Conclusion: This study proves the applicability of nonparametric models to estimate art prices empirically. The developed model described in this paper reduces the transaction cost of artworks and reduces the limitations of the art appraisal system."

There are already situations in which artificial intelligence is used to overcome such limitations.LH Corporation, SH Corporation, Gyeonggi Housing and Urban Corporation, and other related public enterprises have already used artificial intelligence to review the suitability of business requirements, architectural design conforming to building regulations, and estimate the value of previous assets and estimate the value of new buildings. It is being utilized.As a result of analyzing the case of Uijeongbu City, it is not known that the Gyeonggi Housing and Urban Corporation commissioned a company to review the business feasibility with artificial intelligence, so only four of the 18 Block-unit Renewal projects received a feasibility review and thus need to be promoted. Seems to be. In addition, rather than requesting a company through Gyeonggi Housing and Urban Corporation to receive results or reports unilaterally, the use will be maximized if there is an interaction such as sensitivity analysis for changes such as changes in conditions. In addition, it is also necessary to consider proactively discovering and promoting places that meet the requirements of Block-unit Renewal projects in public sectors such as city and public sector through artificial intelligence.In the future, when more automation is carried out and it becomes possible to analyze business requirements and feasibility directly on the web, it is necessary to prepare for situations such as increasing the effect of improving infrastructure by grouping and promoting adjacent areas."

It analyzes the basic structure of neural networks such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which have often been used to generate creative images. It also notes that the training and evaluation of neural networks with proper sample datasets is a crucial step in selecting the aesthetic features that will compose the generated images. The comparison of deep neural networks with video synthesizers reveals that the creative logic of AI runs on digitally encoded linguistic instructions rather than functioning as a physical apparatus. This means that the paradigm of post-medium art, which has been supported by technological advances, would have to shift further to cover artificial agents. Through an attempt to locate AI in Rosalind Krauss’ diagram of the expanded medium, this paper shed light on the potential linkage of AI to the concepts of medium and installation, and brings AI into the realm of the discourse on art medium."

The major factor influencing the contact force is tread wear, and the more tire tread wears out, the higher risk of losing control of a vehicle exits. The tire tread condition is generally checked by visual inspection that can be easily forgotten. In this paper, we propose the intelligent tire (iTire) system that consists of an acceleration sensor, a wireless signal transmission unit and a tread classifier. In addition, we also presents classification algorithm that transforms the acceleration signal into the frequency domain and extracts the features of several frequency bands as inputs to an artificial neural network.

On the Patentability of Artificial Intelligence:a review of recent cases from the U.S.,2020,"['patent eligibility', 'software patent', 'mathematical algorithm', 'artificial intelligence', 'US patent law']",,"As new developments in the field such as neural networks and machine learning have transformed the expectations of AI technology and what it may be capable of, the importance of AI grows exponentially not only in industrial and commercial spheres but also in educational, social and even cultural spheres of our society.Given the importance of AI technology, it follows that the inventors and those involved in the commercialization of the technology would want to protect and exploit the economic value of the technology to its full extent. Obtaining a patent is still one of the most fundamental tools in protecting the economic value of an invention by reserving its exclusive rights to the owner of the patent. However, due to the recent tightening of the requirements in the field of patent law regarding the question of patent-eligibility, it is not entirely clear whether and to what extent AI technology could be patentable. The decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in Alice v CLS Bank and subsequent decisions by the Court of Appeals for Federal Circuit (CAFC) have cast doubt on whether patents that have already been issued for AI satisfy the new tests for patent eligibility and it is difficult to predict with any certainty whether new patent applications in these technologies could satisfy the requirements for patent eligibility due to the fact that these requirements are still in the process of evolution. The traditionally accepted incentive theory would indicate that a strong patent system is the foundation for strong innovation and provides motivation to inventors and offers a known mechanism to evaluate potential returns to potential investors. Although the recent cases have introduced a real element of uncertainty into the system, this will eventually diminish with an accrual of case law through evolving court decisions, and even perhaps new legislation. In the meantime, however, inventors and investors still need to be able to protect their AI technology with patents, even though patents may not necessarily offer a foolproof or ironclad protection they may once seemed to hold out, while knowing that the system was never a guarantee of any value in the invention.This article provides a review of the recent decisions by the courts in the US, including the Federal Circuit on the issue of patentability of AI technology in order to draw out some guidance regarding how inventors and investors should approach this question."

Economic losses from air pollution and threats from ultra fine dust are becoming social problems. Currently, measurements are made through wood and optical measuring equipment, but there is a problem where measurements and human sense of corrective action do not match. This paper aimed to implement an algorithm of judgment to match the measured value with the human sense of visibility. Using IoT-based cameras in buildings, measured photo information is sent to the server to make corrective distance measurements, and real-time transmitted photos and existing measured photo information are processed in high-speed operation through Tensorflow, requiring high-reliability corrective distance. An algorithm that is supplemented with a SVM nonlinear regression model algorithm for existing corrective distance determination algorithms has been implemented to automate with algorithms similar to those that are directly judged by humans. In this study, a support vector machine (SVM) nonlinear regression model algorithm is used to perform high-speed computation using Tensorflow, and a system implementation model is proposed to improve reliability of the corrective judgment algorithm model."

Local Binary Pattern based Defocus Blur Detection using Adaptive Threshold,2020,"['Blur measure', 'Blur segmentation', 'Local binary pattern', 'Support vector machine', 'Adaptive threshold']",,"Enormous methods have been proposed for the detection and segmentation of blur and non-blur regions of the images. Due to the limited available information about the blur type, scenario and the level of blurriness, detection and segmentation is a challenging task. Hence, the performance of the blur measure operators is an essential factor and needs improvement to attain perfection. In this paper, we propose an effective blur measure based on the local binary pattern (LBP) with the adaptive threshold for blur detection. The sharpness metric developed based on LBP uses a fixed threshold irrespective of the blur type and level which may not be suitable for images with large variations in imaging conditions and blur type and level. Contradictory, the proposed measure uses an adaptive threshold for each image based on the image and the blur properties to generate an improved sharpness metric. The adaptive threshold is computed based on the model learned through the support vector machine (SVM). The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using a well-known dataset and compared with five state-of-the-art methods. The comparative analysis reveals that the proposed method performs significantly better qualitatively and quantitatively against all the methods."

As a policy suggestion, a subcommittee was proposed in which experts in technical and social aspects play a professional role in establishing the AI promotion system in Korea. Although the subcommittee works independently, it suggests that it is necessary to establish governance in which the results of activities can be synthesized and integrated."
Data-Driven Approach for the Rapid Simulation of Urban Flood Prediction,2020,"['Urban flood', 'Drainage system', 'One- and two-dimensional', 'Hydraulic analysis', 'Machine learning', 'Flood prediction system', 'Data-driven Model']",,"Flooding due to the increase of heavy rainfall caused even larger damage in metropolitan areas. Therefore, numerical simulation and probabilistic models have been used for flood prediction, but the methodologies for real-time flood prediction by drainage district in metropolitan areas are still not sufficient. In this study, a flood scenario database was established by using one- and two-dimensional hydraulic analysis models to propose a real-time urban flood prediction method by drainage districts in metropolitan areas. Flood prediction models were constructed for each drainage district through the Nonlinear Auto-Regressive with eXogenous inputs and Self-Organizing Map (NARX-SOM). Suggested prediction model is a data-driven model because it is based on flood database which composed with diverse flood simulation results. To evaluate the predictive capacity of the models, flood prediction was performed for the actual heavy rainfall in 2010 and 2011 that caused severe flooding in Seoul, Republic of Korea. Flood prediction models for a total of 24 drainage districts were constructed, and it was found that the goodness of fit on the flood area ranged from 68.7 to 89.7%. In terms of the expected inundation map, the predictive power was found to be high when the SOM result with 5 × 5 dimension was mainly used. Through this study, it was possible to identify the predictive capability of the NARX-SOM flood prediction algorithm. The time for inundation map prediction for each area was within two minutes, but the one- and two-dimensional flood simulation usually takes 60 − 80 minutes. Moreover, when the calculated goodness of fit was examined, the proposed method was found to be a practical methodology that can be helpful in improving flood response capabilities."

The miniaturization and high performance of the IoT sensors are needed for diverse devices including the autonomous driving system. Specially, the miniaturization of the sensors leads to compel the miniaturization of the fixer structures. In the viewpoint of the miniaturization, metallic structure is a best solution to attach the small IoT sensors to the main body. However, it is hard to manufacture the small metallic structure with a conventional machining process or manufacturing cost greatly increases. As one of solutions for the problems, in this work, metallic FDM (Fused depositon modeling) based on metallic filament was proposed and the FDM process was investigated to fabricate the small metallic structure. Final part was obtained by the post-process that consists of debinding and sintering. In this work, the relationship between infill rate and the density of the part after the post-process was investigated. The investigation of the relationship is based on the fact that the infill rate and the density obtained from the post-processing is not same. It can be said that this work is a fundamental research to obtain the higher density of the printed part."

The relationship between humans and AI is legally important, as there are views that artificial intelligence needs to be recognized as a legal entity and that artificial intelligence needs to be held accountable for its action just like humans. If artificial intelligence has free will, there is no reason to treat AI differently from humans.In order to examine whether AI can have free will, it is necessary to define the concept of free will. Free will can be divided into freedom and will. Freedom means being free from physical causes, but the definition of freedom in this way cannot explain the fact that the brain is governed by the laws of physics. To avoid this inconsistency, freedom can be defined as unpredictability and the unknownness of causes. In reality, we can not distinguish the unknownness of causes from nonexistence of causes. In this respect, the human brain is free, because the causes of the brain's judgment can not be physically identified. Will means a mental state that is motivated to achieve a certain purpose. Motivation means desire and dread, or the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. The desire can be divided into first order desire which is directly related to survival or reproduction and second order desire such as curiosity, desire of power, and the pursuit of wealth. Among these two types of desire, only the second order desire is related to the will. In order to recognize the free will of AI, the information processing of AI should be unpredictable and AI should have second order desires. It is impossible to determine the cause of the AI output value. Therefore, information processing of AI is as free as the human brain. However, the activity of the human brain is more difficult to predict than AI because metacognition and self-awareness, or high level awareness is the key attributes of human mind. It is unclear whether high-level awareness of AI based on metacognition is possible. If high-level thinking of AI is impossible, AI is less free than humans.In order for AI to have a will, it must have desire or dread. While desire and dread are motivations for humans, it is not clear how these motivations are working in the brain's information processing. Therefore, in order to make the algorithm of motivations such as desire and dread, we must first reveal the secrets of the human brain. Unlocking the secrets of the brain eventually means unlocking the secret of the beginning of life, which seems to be difficult in the near future. Even if we reveal the secrets of the brain, it is not certain that the algorithm of motivation can be technically developed. Considering these points, it is difficult for AI to have a will. As a result, AI cannot have free will because it has a lower level of freedom than humans, and it is difficult to have will."
SoP Estimation based on Maximum Discharge Current using BiLSTM,2020,"['Battery management system', 'state-of-power', 'maximum discharge current', 'machine learning', '배터리관리시스템', '전력상태', '최대방전전류', '기계학습']",,"An accurate SoC(state-of-charge) to estimate SoP(state-of-power) is the most remarkable technique for electric vehicles (EV). Hence, the estimation of battery state-of-charge prior to estimation of battery state-of-power requires more computation cost and time. This paper makes two contributions: (1) a data-driven SoP estimation method has been proposed to accurately capture the characteristics of the battery through the bidirectional long-short term memory algorithm, (2) the estimation of maximum discharge current based on voltage and SoC constraints using BiLSTM. The robustness of the proposed method has been verified by comparing the method with co-estimation and conventional method. The results show higher accuracy (approximately 24%) compared to the conventional state-of-power estimation method with 15.54 root-mean-square-error and faster computing time (approximately 66%) compared to co-estimation method with 2015 seconds calculation time, which made the proposed SoP estimation more efficient and reliable for the electric vehicles application."

This means that we need substantial and fundamental preventive measures that are different from the ones we have now. Therefore, this study proposed a prediction model that can predict construction disasters in advance using a highly predictable random forest method. The random forest technique was used to analyze the impact factors of the construction disaster, and the model was constructed by selecting the factors of high importance from the variables. As a result of comparing the accuracy of the random forest model and the discrimination analysis model in order to verify the constructed construction disaster prediction model, it is found that the random forest model is more accurate than the discrimination analysis model. Accordingly, it is expected that disaster types that can occur by the prediction model can be accurately predicted in advance and preferentially managed to contribute to disaster prevention."
PSI-rooted subgraph: A novel feature for IoT botnet detection using classifier algorithms,2020,['IoT botnetIoT securityStatic malware detectionPSI-rooted subgraphMachine learningDeep learning'],,"It is obvious that IoT devices are widely used more and more in many areas. However, due to limited resources (e.g., memory, CPU), the security mechanisms on many IoT devices such as IP-Camera, router are low. Therefore, botnets are an emerging threat to compromise IoT devices recently. To tackle this, a novel method for IoT botnets detection plays a crucial role. In this paper, we have some contributions for IoT botnet detection: first, we present a novel high-level PSI-rooted subgraph-based feature for the detection of IoT botnets; second, we generate a limited number of features that have precise behavioral descriptions, which require smaller space and reduce processing time; third, The evaluation results show the effectiveness and robustness of PSI-rooted subgraph-based features, as with five machine classifiers consisting of Random Forest, Decision Tree, Bagging, k-Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machine, each classifier achieves more than 97% detection rate and low time-consuming. Moreover, compared to other work, our proposed method obtains better performance. Finally, we publicize all our materials on Github, which will benefit future research (e.g., IoT botnet detection approach)."

The algorithm will analyze gestures and take actions to perform appropriate action according to users requests via their gestures. The results show that the average accuracy of proposal algorithm is 92.6 percent for images and more than 91 percent for video, which both satisfy performance requirements for real-world application, specifically for smart home services. The processing time is approximately 0.098 second with 10 frames/sec datasets. However, accuracy rate still depends on the number of training images (video) and their resolution."

However, the computation time is exponentially increased depending on the number of types of orders and its quantity demanded. Although many heuristic methods have been proposed to solve the problem, it is difficult to develop a heuristic method that always provides a good solution to various problems due to the performance that is highly dependent on problem domain.

Some Remarks on Gries’s Criticism on a Tree-based Approach of Multifactorial Data,2020,"['tree-based approaches', 'a conditional inference tree', 'multifactorial data', 'corpus linguistics']",,"A tree model that is typically used in data mining and machine learning has been recently adopted to analyze multifactorial data in corpus linguistics. However, Gries (2019) claims that tree-based approaches fail to deal with a data set in which not all input variables are necessary for predicting the target variable accurately. He demonstrates that a tree model reports a three-way interaction even when a two-way interaction can predict the target variable with 100% accuracy because there is another third significant input variable. In this article, I will argue that the result of a conditional inference tree applied to such a data set suggests that a researcher should analyze a two-way interaction effect. In other words, the result allows two different interpretations that are related to the structure of a data set and requires to test whether a two-way interaction is sufficient to explain the data. In doing so, I will show that the presence of the third input variable does not hinder the detection of a perfect two-way interaction that is displayed by a symmetric tree figure."

Traditionally, a qualitative analysis of love-centered lyrics should focus on several typical instances extracted from the whole samples, generalizing the characteristics of a specific writer or brief period. However, with the development of computer science and statistics, it now provides a new perspective for us to elucidate the true meanings behind the natural language texts without human beings’ subjective interpretations. This quantitative analysis method, on the one hand, can efficiently relieve the manual classification burdens and generate a more precise sorting result even than human beings' doing. On the other hand, the rigidly quantized classification criteria sometimes can also incur several enigmatic conclusions conflicting with people's intuitional judgment. To demonstrate the practicability of it, this paper hence chose to manipulate 5082 Korean love-centered lyrics collected from online with 2 kinds of considerably valuable topic models: LAD & STM, aimed to 1. verify the feasibility of automatically constructing a taxonomy system of love-centered lyrics; 2. examine and speculate a diachronic correlation between love-centered lyrics and published years. As a result, it is of great necessity to optimize the themes K selection when conducting a topic modeling experiment. And based on a reasonable classification, it is possible to observe a significant regressive trend on different groups of love-centered lyrics through years. But because of the performance limitation of topic modelling, there are still some biased cases that can be found, which implies a further improvement not just on technical parameter testing but also on a potential collaboration between quantitative and qualitative analysis."

The developments of artificial intelligence presents both opportunities and challenges to cognitive science. First, the developments of artificial intelligence can lead to the deepening of our understandings of human intelligence by assisting cognitive science research. In addition, artificial intelligence can assist human intelligence by providing smart tools with which humans can perform with greater accuracy and efficiency.

For the closed-loop control, illuminance sensors are generally mounted on a horizontal workplane, or the nearest wall/ceiling. As the size and complexity of an indoor space increases, the number of sensors and its corresponding control become complex because illuminance at a certain point is influenced by multiple neighboring lighting fixtures. The open-loop control is disadvantageous because it can’t reflect the illuminance level of a workplane. With this in mind, the authors aim to develop an approach where lighting simulation model could predict the illuminance level at any points of interest, hereby replacing illuminance sensors, and lead to electric lighting energy savings. For this purpose, Radiance, one of the most sophisticated lighting simulation tools, was first employed for daylit and electric lighting prediction of a target building. Then, a surrogate model, ANN (Artificial Neural Network) model, was developed for fast computation and optimal control. Unknown parameters, e.g. reflectances of ceiling, floor, walls, transmittance of glass and light loss factor, were estimated. It was found that the calibrated model’s prediction is accurate and the proposed approach can save lighting energy by 18.6% for three days’ validation period (Mar 9-12, 2020) conducted at the target building."

Leo Marx delineates how early American settlers and writers consider America as a garden with machine in which both metaphors function to bring forth the myth of frontierism. Moon Palace, a rhapsody of chance and fate, delivers Macro’s exploration of his own genealogical origin as well as the truths of American dream and frontierism. Marco, an orphan, lose his uncle, Victor, and falls into a pit of melancholia refusing all activities for perseverance including consumption and communication. In his absolute destitute, he prefers not to do anything like Herman Melville’s Bartleby. After rescued by his friends at the central park where he lives as a homeless, Marco learns and unfolds the truth of his origin by working for his grandfather, Effing.

But now, artificial intelligence has become so advanced without additional human commands through deep learning and machine learning that it can recognize a large amount of information, analyze and learn on its own. Therefore, there are active discussions among countries on how to take legal action against creations created by artificial intelligence. There have been two recent court cases in Chinese courts on creations created by artificial intelligence. One of them had a final decision. It is significant in that the court ruled against a copyright infringement lawsuit against a creation created by artificial intelligence. Therefore, this paper introduces relevant precedents focusing on the Feilin case and Dreamwriter case, which are Chinese court cases on artificial intelligence creations. We examined China's attitude toward artificial intelligence creations through a legal review of the requirements for the establishment of works and the status of authors under the Chinese Copyright Law. AI, which appeared in the two cases, was an weak artificial intelligence stage, based on the assumption that human participation was involved when the final results were produced. The Chinese court denied the identity of the artificial intelligence creation, but recognized it as a work. However, if strong artificial intelligence appears, the current Chinese court cases alone will still not give the answer. If it is difficult to review artificial intelligence creations under the copyright law, the solution to artificial intelligence creations should also be considered in terms of performance made with considerable investment or effort one of the types of anti-unfair competition action."

The world view is a world presented to recognize existing modern machine civilization and industrial civilization as the civilization of killing, and to demand a new recognition for life to replace it. The problems of human-centered industrialization and west-centered modernization have caused problems of vision of life and environmental damage. Jang Ilsoon presents the ecological world view in an attempt to solve the underlying problem based on existential reflection. This is one, but all in all, one world view of holism, the world view of spirituality. This is similar to the deep ecology of the West. The ecological world of Jang Ilsoon can be seen in the Korean natural ecology movement as there is no interaction with each other. The same is true of Jang Ilsoon, as criticisms of deep ecology are irrational and mystic. However, he constitutes an ecological discourse on each and every ethical dimension and avoids these problems. His ecological world view is a mixture of daoism and buddhism centered on the Eastern Learning, which is the traditional idea of Korea. In addition, his special feature is to adjust the daily life movement in daily life, and it can be a characteristic only of Jang Ilsoon’s world view of holism."

This is to characterize text types in lexical units. Although vocabulary is the only entity in the text, it has been neglected in previous research. This is because time and effort were limited in analyzing text at the lexical level. Text mining techniques that deal with big data will reduce this effort. In addition, it is expected that the study of texts in the lexical unit wii be activated in the future.The data used in this study were taken from the online edition of Handelsblatt and from Börse Online, the internet media in Germany, and from Daum’s financial news in Korea. The second half of 2017 is on the uptrend, based on securities firms’ stock market charts. The 2018 interval is set for the downtrend. R and AntConc programs were used to work with word cloud and language statistics.The most frequent vocabulary that appeared in the closing report did not show a big difference in the ranking even if the trend changed. However, the vocabulary groups of the Up and Down were found to have different frequency rankings as time changed. Therefore, it is judged that certain vocabulary groups can be fluidly observed depending on the text types. This kind of vocabulary will also be useful for characterizing text types."

In the ocean data format HDF5, the current and wind velocity data at a specific location were extracted using bilinear interpolation, and then the movement of numerous points was predicted by particles and the results were visualized using polygons and heat maps. In addition, we propose a spill oil particle matching algorithm to compensate for the lack of data and the difference between the spilled oil and movement. The spilled oil particle matching algorithm is an algorithm that tracks the movement of particles by granulating the appearance of surface oil spilled oil. The problem was segmented using principal component analysis and matched using genetic algorithm to the point where the variance of travel distance of effluent oil is minimized. As a result of verifying the effluent oil visualization data, it was confirmed that the particle matching algorithm using principal component analysis and genetic algorithm showed the best performance, and the mean data error was 3.2%."
A Novel Network Anomaly Detection Method based on Data Balancing and Recursive Feature Addition,2020,"['Network anomaly detection', 'data balancing', 'recursive feature addition', 'parameters combination optimization', 'random forests']",,"Network anomaly detection system plays an essential role in detecting network anomaly and ensuring network security. Anomaly detection system based machine learning has become an increasingly popular solution. However, due to the unbalance and high-dimension characteristics of network traffic, the existing methods unable to achieve the excellent performance of high accuracy and low false alarm rate. To address this problem, a new network anomaly detection method based on data balancing and recursive feature addition is proposed. Firstly, data balancing algorithm based on improved KNN outlier detection is designed to select part respective data on each category. Combination optimization about parameters of improved KNN outlier detection is implemented by genetic algorithm. Next, recursive feature addition algorithm based on correlation analysis is proposed to select effective features, in which a cross contingency test is utilized to analyze correlation and obtain a features subset with a strong correlation. Then, random forests model is as the classification model to detection anomaly. Finally, the proposed algorithm is evaluated on benchmark datasets KDD Cup 1999 and UNSW_NB15. The result illustrates the proposed strategies enhance accuracy and recall, and decrease the false alarm rate. Compared with other algorithms, this algorithm still achieves significant effects, especially recall in the small category."
헉슬리 소설 멋진 신세계(Brave New World)에 내재된 인공지능 시대의 전망: 몸(body)을 중심으로,2020,"['멋진 신세계', '인공지능', '우주론적 몸', '친족관계', '사후세계관', 'Brave New World', 'artificial intelligence', 'cosmological body', 'kinship', 'the view of life after death']",,"Artificial intelligence is probably one of the most common issues in 21st century. For example, we are often confronted by new vocabularies such as Fourth Industrial Revolution, Deep Learning, Big Data, AlphaGo and Autonomous Driving which are closely linked to artificial intelligence through various mass media in everyday life. This means that in contemporary society, artificial intelligence is in high demand; hence, it is usually considered an icon and symbol of not only the most advanced technology but also the most efficient and creative invention for human societies. However, some warnings and alerts have also been raised about the gradual replacement of every aspects of all human spheres by artificial intelligence to sustain social and cultural values such as kinship, social rituals and religion in traditional human societies. In that sense, Huxley’s early 20thcentury novel Brave New World reflects the importance of these social and cultural elements in traditional human societies. Thus, in this paper, I analyze some perspectives on the era of artificial intelligence that are embedded within Huxley’s novel, focusing on the ”body“. As far as kinship is concerned, cybots do not have a kinship network. This is because cybots are normally manufactured like machines in large quantities, whereas humans are bound together with kinship either by birth (consanguineal kinship) or by marriage (affinal kinship). Along the same lines, in Huxley’s description of mass reproduction, most babies are born through artificial insemination and are classified into five social classes through the manipulation of genes as well as the developmental environment. Therefore, the future humans in Huxley’s novel do not establish kin memberships such as father, mother, son, and daughter. Thus, they do not keep equivalent kinship terms. In comparison, the aborigines in Huxley’s novel maintain traditional human values such as kinship and kinship terms. In addition, as far as social rituals and religion are concerned, the future human society in Brave New World shows that all humans share everything with other humans; thus, every man can love every woman and vice versa. There exists neither marriage nor any restrictions. In addition, Huxley’s novel portrays death as a cheerful moment, where corpses are cremated and only leave phosphorus fertilizer for the soil. Hence, future humans do not share feelings of awe towards the human spirit and ancestor worship. In this context, future humans in Brave New World currently look like cybots. In other words, we usually believe that the bodies of cybots do not consist of symbolic elements of human kinship, such as bone, blood and flesh. Furthermore, in traditional societies, the human body is often cosmologically divided into the physical body and the spirit after death. Last, Huxley’s novel Brave New World could raise a fresh alarm in the era of artificial intelligence, that is, artificial intelligence is continuously developed to provide ultimate efficiency and convenience for humans. However, like the civilized human society in Brave New World, the immoderately fast-growing development of artificial intelligence in contemporary society will bring a deterioration of humanity and of traditional human values such as kinship, rituals, and religion."
A Hybrid Collaborative Filtering-based Product Recommender System using Search Keywords,2020,"['Recommender System', 'Hybrid Collaborative Filtering', 'Doc2Vec', 'Word Embedding', 'Search Keyword', '추천시스템', '협업필터링', '워드 임베딩', '검색 키워드']",,"A recommender system is a system that recommends products or services that best meet the preferences of each customer using statistical or machine learning techniques. Collaborative filtering (CF) is the most commonly used algorithm for implementing recommender systems. However, in most cases, it only uses purchase history or customer ratings, even though customers provide numerous other data that are available. E-commerce customers frequently use a search function to find the products in which they are interested among the vast array of products offered. Such search keyword data may be a very useful information source for modeling customer preferences. However, it is rarely used as a source of information for recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid CF model based on the Doc2Vec algorithm using search keywords and purchase history data of online shopping mall customers. To validate the applicability of the proposed model, we empirically tested its performance using real-world online shopping mall data from Korea. As the number of recommended products increases, the recommendation performance of the proposed CF (or, hybrid CF based on the customer’s search keywords) is improved. On the other hand, the performance of a conventional CF gradually decreased as the number of recommended products increased. As a result, we found that using search keyword data effectively represents customer preferences and might contribute to an improvement in conventional CF recommender systems."

For the smooth language processing between human and machine, it is needed to have the detailed information display of meanings of words or a certain standard of semantic presentation.

비대칭적 전이효과와 SVM을 이용한 변동성 매도전략의 수익성 개선,2020,"['효율적 시장', '비대칭적 전이효과', '변동성 매도전략', 'SVM', 'Sharpe Ratio', 'Efficient Market Hypothesis', 'Asymmetric Spillover Effect', 'Volatility Short Strategy', 'Support Vector Machines', 'Sharpe Ratio']",,"Fama asserted that in an efficient market, we can’t make a trading rule that consistently outperforms the average stock market returns. This study aims to suggest a machine learning algorithm to improve the trading performance of an intraday short volatility strategy applying asymmetric volatility spillover effect, and analyze its trading performance improvement.  Generally stock market volatility has a negative relation with stock market return and the Korean stock market volatility is influenced by the US stock market volatility. This volatility spillover effect is asymmetric. The asymmetric volatility spillover effect refers to the phenomenon that the US stock market volatility up and down differently influence the next day’s volatility of the Korean stock market. We collected the S&P 500 index, VIX, KOSPI 200 index, and V-KOSPI 200 from 2008 to 2018. We found the negative relation between the S&P 500 and VIX, and the KOSPI 200 and V-KOSPI 200. We also documented the strong volatility spillover effect from the VIX to the V-KOSPI 200. Interestingly, the asymmetric volatility spillover was also found. Whereas the VIX up is fully reflected in the opening volatility of the V-KOSPI 200, the VIX down influences partially in the opening volatility and its influence lasts to the Korean market close. If the stock market is efficient, there is no reason why there exists the asymmetric volatility spillover effect. It is a counter example of the efficient market hypothesis.  To utilize this type of anomalous volatility spillover pattern, we analyzed the intraday volatility selling strategy. This strategy sells short the Korean volatility market in the morning after the US stock market volatility closes down and takes no position in the volatility market after the VIX closes up. It produced profit every year between 2008 and 2018 and the percent profitable is 68%. The trading performance showed the higher average annual return of 129% relative to the benchmark average annual return of 33%. The maximum draw down, MDD, is -41%, which is lower than that of benchmark -101%. The Sharpe ratio 0.32 of SVS strategy is much greater than the Sharpe ratio 0.08 of the Benchmark strategy. The Sharpe ratio simultaneously considers return and risk and is calculated as return divided by risk. Therefore, high Sharpe ratio means high performance when comparing different strategies with different risk and return structure. Real world trading gives rise to the trading costs including brokerage cost and slippage cost. When the trading cost is considered, the performance difference between 76% and -10% average annual returns becomes clear.  To improve the performance of the suggested volatility trading strategy, we used the well-known SVM algorithm. Input variables include the VIX close to close return at day t-1, the VIX open to close return at day t-1, the VK open return at day t, and output is the up and down classification of the VK open to close return at day t. The training period is from 2008 to 2014 and the testing period is from 2015 to 2018. The kernel functions are linear function, radial basis function, and polynomial function. We suggested the modified-short volatility strategy that sells the VK in the morning when the SVM output is Down and takes no position when the SVM output is Up. The trading performance was remarkably improved. The 5-year testing period trading results of the m-SVS strategy showed very high profit and low risk relative to the benchmark SVS strategy. The annual return of the m-SVS strategy is 123% and it is higher than that of SVS strategy. The risk factor, MDD, was also significantly improved from -41% to –29%."

In the proposed method, the data is reduced to important feature dimensions by applying the PCA technique, one of the dimension reduction machine learning algorithms. Through the weights derived during the dimensional reduction process, the important points of data in each reduced dimensional axis are identified. Each dimension axis has a different weight in the total data according to the size of the eigenvalue of the axis. Accordingly, a weight proportional to the size of the eigenvalues of each dimension axis is given, and an operation process is performed to add important points of data in each dimension axis. The critical area of the data is calculated by applying a threshold to the data obtained through the calculation process. After that, induces reverse mapping to the original data in the important area of the derived data, and selects the important area in the original data space.

The analysis corpus should be constructed in a larger amount to increase objectivity and usability. Therefore, research is needed to increase the processing power of the morphological analyzer. In this regard, this paper proposes setting an array constraint between syntactically adjacent constituents and accumulating it by describing it as a regular expression.  There were two main backgrounds for this proposal. First, there has been a vacancy in the aspect of morphological analysis in the grammar description that has been used in mainstream syntax. Second, there was a limit to the way that has improved the performance of the morphological analyzer through learning based on individual examples.  Constraints on the arrangement of adjacent components must take both concrete usage and abstract explanatory power. The constraints should be set relatively freely from the previous syntax rules and lexical constraints, and it must be formulated to increase the effectiveness of the description. This paper describes these constraints as a regular expression expressing a syntactic relationship.  If the Korean academia continues to review and accumulate these regular expressions, the following effects will be obtained. First, it will be possible to develop a rules-based morphological analyzer. Second, it can be a method to explicitly share and discuss usage-based detailed discussions about grammar relations."

Although the modeling-attack resistance of an MA-APUF has been improved considerably by architecture modifications, the response generation method of an MA-APUF results in low uniqueness. In this study, we demonstrate three design problems regarding the low uniqueness that APUF-based strong PUFs may exhibit, and we present several foundational principles to improve the uniqueness of APUF-based strong PUFs. In particular, an improved MA-APUF design is implemented in an FPGA and evaluated using a well-established experimental setup. Two types of evaluation metrics are used for evaluation and comparison. Furthermore, evolution strategies, logistic regression, and K-junta functions are used to evaluate the security of our design. The experiment results reveal that the uniqueness of our improved MA-APUF is 81.29% (compared with that of the MA-APUF, 13.12%), and the prediction rate is approximately 56% (compared with that of the MA-APUF (60%-80%)."

Risk prediction and marker selection in nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms using whole genome sequencing data,2020,"['Breeding', 'deleterious effect', 'marker selection', 'nsSNP', 'risk prediction']",,"Despite the various existing studies about nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs), genome-wide studies based on nsSNPs are rare. NsSNPs alter amino acid sequences, affect protein structure and function, and have deleterious effects. By predicting the deleterious effect of nsSNPs, we determined the total risk score per individual. Additionally, the machine learning technique was utilized to find an optimal nsSNP subset that best explains the complete nsSNP effect. A total of 16,100 nsSNPs were selected as the best representatives among 89,519 regressed nsSNPs. In the gene ontology analysis encompassing the 16,100 nsSNPs, DNA metabolic process, chemokine- and immune-related, and reproduction were the most enriched terms. We expect that our risk score prediction and nsSNP marker selection will contribute to future development of extant genome-wide association studies and breeding science more broadly."

Artificial neural networks (ANN) is a field of machine learning that mimics the neural network of living organisms. They show good performance in pattern recognition. Although researches has been using ANNs to estimate the DoAs, there are limitations in dealing with variations of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the target signals. In this paper, we propose a three-stage ANN algorithm for DoA estimation. The proposed algorithm can minimize the performance reduction by applying the model trained in a single SNR environment to various environments through a ‘noise reduction process’. Furthermore, the scheme reduces the difficulty in learning and maintains efficiency in estimation, by employing a process of DoA shift. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) and the performances of existing subspace-based algorithms and show that the proposed scheme exhibits better performance than other schemes in some severe environments such as low SNR environments or situations in which targets are located very close to each other."

In the early 1950s, North Korea pursued rapid post-war restoration and industrialization through the aid of socialist countries such as the Soviet Union. Therefore, it was also a period when learning the Soviet Union was most emphasized. However, in response to Soviet intervention in the mid-1950s, the North Korean regime tried to escape from Soviet influence. The Soviet Union also pressed North Korea by drastically reducing aid to North Korea. As a result, North Korea pursued an “independent economy” that could operate without the help of the Soviet Union. This series of changes was most realized by the workers in the production site. During the post-war restoration period, large amounts of aid were received from the Soviet Union, and most of them were introduced into the industrial field in the form of various machines, facilities, factories, technologies and work methods. Therefore, workers had to learn and adapt to new machines, technologies and working methods. In the process, North Korean workers had to resolve problems arising from the use of Soviet machinery. There were workers who had adapted easily, but there were also workers who adhered to the machines and working methods that were familiar to the past. Amid a sharp decline in Soviet aid, the first five-year plan focused on heavy industry demanded active and dedicated efforts from workers. A sharp drop in aid meant a shortage of foreign currency, so workers had to save supplies in all directions. In particular, efforts to conserve fuel such as coal and gasoline, which were dependent on imports, were made great efforts. Workers had to use anthracite that could be produced in North Korea to replace imported coal, and to reduce the use of gasoline, they created cars that run on alternative fuels. In addition, the localization of various machinery and equipment, which depended on imports, also proceeded in earnest. Thanks to the growth of the machinery industry, workers in this period succeeded in producing automobiles and tractors with only their own skills and efforts."

An efficient hybrid TLBO-PSO-ANN for fast damage identification in steel beam structures using IGA,2020,"['IsoGeometric Analysis', 'damage identification', 'TLBO', 'PSO-ANN', 'dynamic analysis']",,"The existence of damages in structures causes changes in the physical properties by reducing the modal parameters. In this paper, we develop a two-stages approach based on normalized Modal Strain Energy Damage Indicator (<i>nMSEDI</i>) for quick applications to predict the location of damage. A two-dimensional IsoGeometric Analysis (2D-IGA), Machine Learning Algorithm (MLA) and optimization techniques are combined to create a new tool. In the first stage, we introduce a modified damage identification technique based on frequencies using <i>nMSEDI</i> to locate the potential of damaged elements. In the second stage, after eliminating the healthy elements, the damage index values from <i>nMSEDI</i> are considered as input in the damage quantification algorithm. The hybrid of Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are used along with nMSEDI. The objective of TLBO is to estimate the parameters of PSO-ANN to find a good training based on actual damage and estimated damage. The IGA model is updated using experimental results based on stiffness and mass matrix using the difference between calculated and measured frequencies as objective function. The feasibility and efficiency of nMSEDI-PSO-ANN after finding the best parameters by TLBO are demonstrated through the comparison with nMSEDI-IGA for different scenarios. The result of the analyses indicates that the proposed approach can be used to determine correctly the severity of damage in beam structures."
Some Remarks on Gries’s Criticism on a Tree-based Approach of Multifactorial Data,2020,"['tree-based approaches', 'a conditional inference tree', 'multifactorial data', 'corpus linguistics']",,"Keun Young Shin. 2020. Some Remarks on Gries’s Criticism on a Tree-based Approach of Multifactoral Data. Language and Information 24.1, 15-28. A tree model that is typically used in data mining and machine learning has been recently adopted to analyze multifactorial data in corpus linguistics. However, Gries (2019) claims that tree-based approaches fail to deal with a data set in which not all input variables are necessary for predicting the target variable accurately. He demonstrates that a tree model reports a three-way interaction even when a two-way interaction can predict the target variable with 100% accuracy because there is another third significant input variable. In this article, I will argue that the result of a conditional inference tree applied to such a data set suggests that a researcher should analyze a two-way interaction effect. In other words, the result allows two different interpretations that are related to the structure of a data set and requires to test whether a two-way interaction is sufficient to explain the data. In doing so, I will show that the presence of the third input variable does not hinder the detection of a perfect two-way interaction that is displayed by a symmetric tree figure.

In order to propose ""visual grammar,"" literature study on data visualization in the fields of information engineering, data mining, machine learning, and information design, and a case study of 236 libraries of D3.js (Data-Driven Documents) based on a web browser were conducted. In order to visualize relational data, a ""visual grammar"" system was proposed.  The results and cotents of the study are as follows. First, the clustering type of data visualization for ""visual grammar"" is largely proposed as the density-based clustering type and the hierarchy-based clustering type by the clustering algorithm in the data visualization process in the field of information engineering. Second, as a component of ""visual grammar"" for relational data visualization, four visualization attributes, ‘Data cluster’, ‘Connection’, ‘Linkage’, ‘Attachment’, and three data variables (Quantitative Variable, Category Variable, Sequence Variable) and seven visual variables (color, shape, size, direction, texture, value, location). Third, according to the attributes of visualization, the Gestalt law was applied as the visual grammar and visualization principle.  Based on the results of this study, the necessity of in-depth linkage research between information engineering and information design and the possibility of the development of ""visual grammar"" for standardization of data visualization were discovered. In this study, only the visualization principle was presented based on the case of D3.js (Data-Driven Documents). However, in the future, visual grammar of relational data will be specified through verification of visualization techniques and principles, and visual grammar of other types of data will be proposed."

Among these technologies, one of the artificial intelligence techniques, the deep learning technique is used.As another method, a method of detecting an object using a stereo vision camera is also used. However, these techniques require expensive hardware equipment because of the computational complexity of used to detect objects. However, most video equipments have a significant decrease in computational processing power, and thus, in order to detect passengers on the bus, there is a need for an image processing technology suitable for various equipment using a relatively low computational technique. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a technique that can efficiently obtain the number of passengers on the bus by detecting the contour of the object through the background subtraction suitable for low-cost equipment. Experiments have shown that passengers were counted with approximately 70% accuracy on lower-end machines than those equipped with stereo vision camera."

In this study, computational linguistic methodologies, such as word-embedding and clustering, were applied to a diachronic corpus to capture forward changes in language. Historical linguistics research is challenging because of the difficulties in reconstructing and verifying non-existent proto-languages. However, discoveries about how languages change are being made through computational linguistics using the vast amount of language data available to overcome these difficulties. Machine learning can be used to understand how languages change by reconstructing languages and analyzing diachronic corpuses from different periods. In this study, a Korean diachronic newspaper corpus from the first half of the 20th century was analyzed for changes in vocabulary usage patterns by applying word-embedded clustering. Clustering every 10 years after word-embedding for compound words that contain “jooeui” (ideology), such as “minjoojooeui” (democracy) and “jayoojooeui” (liberalism), showed changes in vocabulary usage over time."

We collected and analyzed English abstracts of 1,868 papers of three Korean major journals in the area of international trade from 2003 to 2019. We used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA), an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to extract the latent topics from the large quantity of research abstracts. 20 topics are identified without any prior human judgement. The topics reveal topographical maps of research in international trade and are representative and meaningful in the sense that most of them correspond to previously established sub-topics in trade studies. Then we conducted a regression analysis on the document-topic distributions generated by LDA to identify hot and cold topics. We discovered 2 hot topics(internationalization capacity and performance of export companies, economic effect of trade) and 2 cold topics(exchange rate and current account, trade finance). Trade studies are characterized as a interdisciplinary study of three agendas(i.e. international economy, International Business, trade practice), and 20 topics identified can be grouped into these 3 agendas. From the estimated results of the study, we find that the Korean government’s active pursuit of FTA and consequent necessity of capacity building in Korean export firms lie behind the popularity of topic selection by the Korean researchers in the area of int’l trade."

The unitgeneration rate method used to estimate waste generation is widely used because it is convenient to apply. However,because it has various problems, methods for forecasting waste generation must be improved. Machine learning techniquesare being used to forecast prices and demand in various areas, such as economy and industrial engineering. This studyapplies those techniques for predicting waste generation and compares the results with those obtained using existingmethodologies. In this study, 80% (January 2013 to December 2016) of the data were used for training purposes, and20% (January 2017 to December 2017) were used for testing. The results of five hundred iterations show that the minimumvalue of 515.4 ton/day, the one-quartile value of 573.6 ton/day, and the median value of 590.4 ton/day in 2020, aresignificantly different from the results obtained using the unit generation rate method (547.7 ton/day). It was also shownthat future waste generation will continue to increase despite a decrease in population, and then it converges on 614.9ton/day in 2030. In other words, the model that was applied in this study is more suitable for short-term forecasts thanfor long-term forecasts. In addition, results of this study suggest that future increases in waste generation would be dueto changes in the population structure and the developing delivery service."

Automated machine learning (AutoML) was used to classify landslides and non-landslides. The verification results revealed that the best model, an extremely randomized tree (XRT) with excellent predictive performance, yielded 83.977% of prediction rates on test data. As a result of the analysis to determine the variable importance of the landslide susceptibility factors, it was composed of 10 topographic factors and 9 geological factors, which was presented as a percentage for each factor. This model was evaluated probabilistically and quantitatively for the likelihood of landslide occurrence by deriving the ranking of variable importance using only on-site survey data. It is considered that this model can provide a reliable basis for slope safety assessment through field surveys to decision-makers in the future."

Therefore, this paper proposes a method of predicting the PM2.5 concentration based on image analysis technology that combines image data, which can reflect the original weather conditions, with currently popular machine learning methods. First, based on local parameter estimation, autoregressive (AR) model analysis and local estimation of the increase in image blur, we extract features from the weather images using an approach inspired by free energy and a no-reference robust metric model. Next, we compare the coefficient energy and contrast difference of each pixel in the AR model and then use the percentages to calculate the image sharpness to derive the overall mass fraction. Furthermore, the results are compared. The relationship between residual value and PM2.5 concentration is fitted by generalized Gauss distribution (GGD) model. Finally, nonlinear mapping is performed via the wavelet neural network (WNN) method to obtain the PM2.5 concentration. Experimental results obtained on real data show that the proposed method offers an improved prediction accuracy and lower root mean square error (RMSE)."

Advanced neuroimaging techniques for evaluating pediatric epilepsy,2020,"['Child', 'Epilepsy', 'Neuroimaging', 'Diffusion tensor imaging', 'Functional magnetic resonance imaging']",,"Accurate localization of the seizure onset zone is important for better seizure outcomes and preventing deficits following epilepsy surgery. Recent advances in neuroimaging techniques have increased our understanding of the underlying etiology and improved our ability to noninvasively identify the seizure onset zone. Using epilepsy-specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols, structural MRI allows better detection of the seizure onset zone, particularly when it is interpreted by experienced neuroradiologists. Ultra-high-field imaging and postprocessing analysis with automated machine learning algorithms can detect subtle structural abnormalities in MRI-negative patients. Tractography derived from diffusion tensor imaging can delineate white matter connections associated with epilepsy or eloquent function, thus, preventing deficits after epilepsy surgery. Arterial spin-labeling perfusion MRI, simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG)-functional MRI (fMRI), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are noinvasive imaging modalities that can be used to localize the epileptogenic foci and assist in planning epilepsy surgery with positron emission tomography, ictal single-photon emission computed tomography, and intracranial EEG monitoring. MEG and fMRI can localize and lateralize the area of the cortex that is essential for language, motor, and memory function and identify its relationship with planned surgical resection sites to reduce the risk of neurological impairments. These advanced structural and functional imaging modalities can be combined with postprocessing methods to better understand the epileptic network and obtain valuable clinical information for predicting long-term outcomes in pediatric epilepsy."

Urban sprawl growth has been always also a worldwide concern that needs to carefully monitor particularly in a developing country where unplanned building constriction has been expanding at a high rate. Recently, remotely sensed imageries with a very high spatial/spectral resolution and state of the art machine learning approaches sent the urban classification and growth monitoring to a higher level. In this research, we classified the Quickbird satellite imagery by object-based image analysis of Dempster- Shafer (OBIA-DS) for the years of 2002 and 2015 at Karbala-Iraq. The real LULC changes including, residential sprawl expansion, amongst these years, were identified via change detection procedure. In accordance with extracted features of LULC and detected trend of urban pattern, the future LULC dynamic was simulated by using land transformation model (LTM) in geospatial information system (GIS) platform. Both classification and prediction stages were successfully validated using ground control points (GCPs) through accuracy assessment metric of Kappa coefficient that indicated 0.87 and 0.91 for 2002 and 2015 classification as well as 0.79 for prediction part. Detail results revealed a substantial growth in building over fifteen years that mostly replaced by agriculture and orchard field. The prediction scenario of LULC sprawl development for 2030 revealed a substantial decline in green and agriculture land as well as an extensive increment in build-up area especially at the countryside of the city without following the residential pattern standard.

However, it can cause great social impact if it facilitates the spread of rumors. Efforts to classify rumors and prevent the spread of false information are imperative because rumors can cause great damage in reality. In this paper, we proposed a method of training machine learning classifiers for rumor classification tasks by modeling the diffusion network from tracing rumors in social media. We extracted structural, temporal, and social characteristics from the diffusion network and used them as features to classify rumors. Based on the characteristics extracted from the real-world Twitter data, the study showed that the ensemble classifier had 69.3% accuracy and a 0.686 F1 score in network classification tasks with four labels: true rumors, false rumors, unverified messages, and non-rumors."
Impurity profiling and chemometric analysis of methamphetamine seizures in Korea,2020,"['methamphetamine', 'impurity profiling', 'chemometric analysis', 'GC-FID/MS']",,"Methamphetamine (MA) is currently the most abused illicit drug in Korea. MA is produced by chemical synthesis, and the final target drug that is produced contains small amounts of the precursor chemicals, intermediates, and by-products. To identify and quantify these trace compounds in MA seizures, a practical and feasible approach for conducting chromatographic fingerprinting with a suite of traditional chemometric methods and recently introduced machine learning approaches was examined. This was achieved using gas chromatography (GC) coupled with a flame ionization detector (FID) and mass spectrometry (MS). Following appropriate examination of all the peaks in 71 samples, 166 impurities were selected as the characteristic components. Unsupervised (principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and K-means clustering) and supervised (partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), support vector machines (SVM), and deep neural network (DNN) with Keras) chemometric techniques were employed for classifying the 71 MA seizures. The results of the PCA, HCA, K-means clustering, PLS-DA, OPLS-DA, SVM, and DNN methods for quality evaluation were in good agreement. However, the tested MA seizures possessed distinct features, such as chirality, cutting agents, and boiling points. The study indicated that the established qualitative and semi-quantitative methods will be practical and useful analytical tools for characterizing trace compounds in illicit MA seizures. Moreover, they will provide a statistical basis for identifying the synthesis route, sources of supply, trafficking routes, and connections between seizures, which will support drug law enforcement agencies in their effort to eliminate organized MA crime."
Word2Vec 분석을 통한 근대 계몽기 잡지에서의 ‘문명(文明)’의 시기별 지형도,2020,"['문명', 'Word2Vec', '사회진화론', '경제사회', '심리적 구조', 'Civilization', 'Social Evolution', 'Economic Society', 'Psychological Structure']",,"This study examines the characteristics of the concept of ‘civilization’ by period, using a Word2Vec methodology, targeting 11 Korean articles written in Chinese script which were published in modern enlightenment magazines between 1906 and 1910. The meaning field of ‘civilization’ across this period was characterized through a ‘top-down’ analysis of the keyword “civilization” together with a list of synonyms adduced by machine learning, using an unsupervised learning algorithm called ‘Word2Vec’.Between 1906 and 1910, the relative usage of the concept of 'civilization' fluctuated greatly, rising sharply until 1908, and falling sharply after 1909. At the peak, in 1908, terms related to evolutionary development and the market economy formed a dense list of synonyms. But In 1909 and 1910, various terms occurred which could not be clustered or which differ in character when compared to the earlier period.Based on these characteristics, the features of the meaning of ‘civilization’ in the targeted articles can be summarized as follows: First, those related to social evolution and Asianism. Second, those related to the economic field and daily discourse. Third, those related to the formation of discipline and character and the formation of an aesthetic disposition. These characteristics show how the internal and psychological process of civilization follows the external and structural process of civilization.The concept of civilization has previously been discussed in close connection with the discourse of the nation-state as one of the characteristics of modernity, but this study confirms that the concept of civilization is also inextricably related to the establishment of the modern economic field. Also, in 1909 and 1910, among the terms that formed a significant relationship with civilization, many were identified which relate to literature and art. This shows the relationship between the liberal arts, cultivated discourse and civilization, due to the functional division of society and the entanglement of human relationships."
해상 이미지를 활용한 3D 합성곱 신경망과합성곱 장단기 메모리 신경망 기반의 유의 파고 추정,2020,"['Significant Wave Height', '3D Convolution', 'Convolutional LSTM', 'Image Processing']",,"One of the most common measures implemented in the operation of large vessels is to find the route that takes the least fuel consumption based on marine conditions, such as wave height. The model that predicts wave height can roughly be categorized into two methods, namely, a numerical method that calculates by physical formula and a soft-computing method that collects weather information and learns the machine learning algorithm. These models are difficult to apply in the real world because of their high computational complexity and the use of expensive radar equipment. In this study, we propose to estimate the wave height in real time using the images of the ocean. We used the image data consisting of four consecutive images instead of a single image and applied the combination of convolutional LSTM and 3D CNN networks that can best handle the data structure as a regression model. In this way of prediction, existing methods are not only outperformed but are also more robust to outliers. We used data from the “Weather 1st” ship provided by Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering and confirmed that the mean absolute error is 1.59 cm, and the mean absolute percentage error is as low as 1.61% based on the test set."
Land Use Feature Extraction and Sprawl Development Prediction from Quickbird Satellite Imagery Using Dempster-Shafer and Land Transformation Model,2020,"['Urban growth prediction', 'remote sensing', 'land transformation model', 'object-based image analysis', 'Dempster-Shafer']",,"Accurate knowledge of land use/land cover (LULC) features and their relative changes over upon the time are essential for sustainable urban management. Urban sprawl growth has been always also a worldwide concern that needs to carefully monitor particularly in a developing country where unplanned building constriction has been expanding at a high rate. Recently, remotely sensed imageries with a very high spatial/spectral resolution and state of the art machine learning approaches sent the urban classification and growth monitoring to a higher level. In this research, we classified the Quickbird satellite imagery by object-based image analysis of Dempster-Shafer (OBIA-DS) for the years of 2002 and 2015 at Karbala-Iraq. The real LULC changes including, residential sprawl expansion, amongst these years, were identified via change detection procedure. In accordance with extracted features of LULC and detected trend of urban pattern, the future LULC dynamic was simulated by using land transformation model (LTM) in geospatial information system (GIS) platform. Both classification and prediction stages were successfully validated using ground control points (GCPs) through accuracy assessment metric of Kappa coefficient that indicated 0.87 and 0.91 for 2002 and 2015 classification as well as 0.79 for prediction part. Detail results revealed a substantial growth in building over fifteen years that mostly replaced by agriculture and orchard field. The prediction scenario of LULC sprawl development for 2030 revealed a substantial decline in green and agriculture land as well as an extensive increment in build-up area especially at the countryside of the city without following the residential pattern standard. The proposed method helps urban decision-makers to identify the detail temporal-spatial growth pattern of highly populated cities like Karbala. Additionally, the results of this study can be considered as a probable future map in order to design enough future social services and amenities for the local inhabitants."

The ethical debate on human lies proceeded from the obligatory, utilitarian, and virtuous ethical perspectives. Based on the human lies defined in these three points of view, artificial intelligence lies can be applied in a limited way to the obligatory, utilitarian, and virtuous ethical perspectives that define human lies. However, the lies of artificial intelligence cannot be completely defined by these three perspectives because the machine learning process of artificial intelligence cannot be analyzed. Lies of artificial intelligence can reflect the characteristics of each of these by the deontological, utilitarian, and virtuous ethical data, which are the requirements for the analysis of human lies. However, artificial intelligence lies have certain characteristics that can define human lies. Currently, no expression can define characteristics beyond the scope of human lies, but it is evident that it goes beyond the scope of artificial intelligence lies.This study can be a stepping stone in finding the standard point of view to define ‘artificial intelligence lies’ by comparing artificial intelligence lies with human lies. In future research, it is necessary to systematize the relationship between human lies and artificial intelligence lies based on the ethics presented in this paper."

Improvement of the Rapid-Development Thunderstorm (RDT) Algorithm for Use with the GK2A Satellite,2020,['Thunderstorm . Detecting convective cells . Nowcasting . Lightning verification'],,"New technologies for the classification of convective cloud lifecycles and the prediction of their movements are needed to detect severe convective weather and to support objective cloud guidance. Satellites enable earlier detection of severe weather over larger coverage areas than ground-based observations or radar. The use of satellite observations for nowcasting is thus likely. In this study, convective initiation (CI) data are paired with a modified rapid-development thunderstorm (RDT) algorithm for the analysis of new data from the Geostationary Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite-2A (GEO-KOMPSAT-2A, GK2A). The RDT algorithm is further modified to accommodate the additional GK2A satellite channels, and new satellite data are used to continuously analyze thunderstorms associated with severe weather in Korea. The logistic regression (LR) machine learning approach is used to optimize the criteria of interest fields and weighting coefficients of the RDT algorithm for convective detection. In addition, auxiliary data (cloud type, convective rainfall rate, and cloud top temperature/height) calculated from RDTsub-module is replaced with GK2A derived products. The fullymodified RDTalgorithm(K-RDT) is quantitatively verified using lightning data from summer convection cases. The probability of detection (POD) for convective clouds is increased by 30– 40%, and the threat score (TS) for average lightning activity is improved by 10–30%. The channel properties of Japan Himawari- 8 satellite are similar to those of the GK2A satellite. Due to the lack ofGK2A satellite data during the development period, CI data from the Himawari-8 satellite are used as proxies."

While these studies have accumulated increasingly refined evidence on PM2.5-health associations, the needs for more advanced PM2.5 exposure models have also grown. For the last two decades, PM2.5 estimation approaches using satellite remote sensing have been developed and advanced, taking advantage of quantitative aerosol data (e.g., aerosol optical depth; AOD), the development of satellite instruments and data retrieval algorithms, and the application of statistical and machine learning techniques. Subsequently, the satellite-based PM2.5 concentrations have contributed to health effect studies by providing spatially resolved exposure estimates of ambient PM2.5 and thus reducing exposure misclassification. This article summarizes previous development and recent advancement of satellite-based PM2.5 exposure assessment in the context of satellite aerosol products and PM2.5 estimation methodologies. Furthermore, this article deals with enhanced satellite capabilities of generating the exposure estimates of PM2.5 composition and time-resolved PM2.5.

Tested categories for measuring physical strength were general endurance, muscular strength, and flexibility for health-related physical strength, and quickness, balance, and agility for skill-related physical strength. For the physical growth index, polynomial regression of body weight for height was established, and an evaluation chart for polynomial regression with a validate degree was set up based on the residual sum of squares and the AIC.For cluster analysis, the research adopted unsupervised learning of machine learning utilizing big data and clustered the observed values with similar characteristics in the data consisted of only observed variables (independent variables)(target variables or dependent variables were not included).As a result, cluster 1 was consisted of subjects with poor physical strength, while cluster 2 was a group with developed muscular endurance and balance. Subjects in cluster 3 showed excellence in agility only, while cluster 4 was consisted of children with good muscular strength. It is considered that the differences in physical growth due to different growth periods of children led to such differences in physical strength; the reason subjects were grouped in the aforementioned clusters also seemed to be the different levels of development reflecting the characteristic of children’s physical strength."

The law should be applied to damage caused by defects of self-driving cars.However, since the law was not enacted with the introduction of engineering machines with a high level of thinking or judgment ability as that of humans, it is very difficult for victims to ask manufacturers of self-driving cars to be responsible for manufacturing defects. Among other things, this is because it is not easy for victims to prove that the damage was caused by the defects of the cars.Therefore, in order to ensure the effectiveness of the Product Liability Act for self-driving car accidents, in this regard, this paper examines the present Product Liability Act and the Rules on the Performance and Standards of the Automobile and Auto Parts, the safety standards of the partial self-driving system, and then tries to present the need for and alternatives to hold a manufacturer accountable for the defects of self-driving cars."

This study proposed a design methodology for the perforated panel facades that reflects the location on the facades and the user’s requirements. The optimization of quantitative and qualitative performance is achieved through communication between designers and users in a VR system. In optimizing quantitative performances, designers use machine learning techniques such as clustering and genetic algorithm to allocate optimal panels on the facades. In optimizing qualitative performances, through the VR system, users intervene in evaluating performances whose preferences are depending on them. The experiment using the office project showed that designers were able to make decisions based on clustering using GMM to optimize multiple quantitative performances. The gap between the target and final performance could be narrowed by limiting the types of perforated panels considering mass customization. In assessing visibility as a qualitative performance, users were able to participate in the design process using the VR system."
A Unified Hierarchy for AI and Natural Intelligence through Auto-Programming for General Purposes,2020,,,"Despite the current great public interest in neural network based artificial intelligence, there exists a huge gap between artificial intelligence (AI) and natural intelligence (NI).

The term united means not only for AI and NI both, but also for all practical sensory modalities and motor modalities, including perception, representation/reasoning, learning, societal activities and politics. This line of work has been supported by rigorous mathematical proofs and initial experimental verications.However, this paper minimizes mathematical material so that the new in- formation here can reach a wide audience. We should ask a new and general question: How can a machine, natural or artificial, Autonomously Program For General Purposes (APFGP) from the real physical world?We have given this question a solution, theoretically, experimentally, and mathematically. A clear but powerful learning engine|Developmental Network (DN) enables APFGP. Hopefully, understanding APFGP for both AI and NI not only fully automate constructions of AI systems but also improve human development, individually and societally."

We compared genetic variants and classified them as concordant, primary-specific, and metastasis-specific variants. We used a combination of principal components analysis and clustering to find genomic groups. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to appraise survival between genomic groups. We used machine learning to confirm the correlation between genetic variants and metastatic sites.Results A total of 282 types of deleterious non-synonymous variants were selected for analysis. Of a total of 897 variants, an average of 40% was discordant. Three genomic groups were yielded based on the genomic discrepancy patterns. Overall survival differed significantly between the genomic groups. The poorest group had the highest proportion of concordant KRAS G12V and additional metastasis-specific SMAD4. Correlation analysis between genetic variants and metastatic sites suggested that concordant KRAS mutations would have more disseminated metastases.Conclusion Driver gene mutations were mostly concordant; however, discordant or metastasis-specific mutations were present. Clinically, the concordant driver genetic changes with additional metastasis-specific variants can predict poor prognosis for patients with CRC."
Poultry farm vehicle movements as risk factors for the 2014/15 highly pathogenic avian influenza epidemics in the Republic of Korea,2020,"['Highly pathogenic avian influenza', 'BRT', 'GLM', 'risk factors', 'Republic of Korea']",,"Since the first HPAI epidemics in 2003, there has been little epidemiological research on the association between HPAI epidemics and vehicle movements around poultry farms. This study examined the relationship between vehicle movements around poultry farms and the 2014/15 HPAI epidemics in the Republic of Korea using two methods: a boosted regression trees (BRT) model and logistic regression of a generalized linear model (GLM). The BRT model considers the non-linearity association between the frequency of vehicle movements around poultry farms and the HPAI outbreak status per province using a machine learning technique. In contrast, a GLM assesses the relationship based on the traditional frequentist method. Among the three types of vehicle movements (outbound, inbound, and within), only the outbound was found to be a risk factor of the 2014/15 HPAI epidemics according to both the BRT model and multivariate logistic regression of GLM. In the BRT model results, the median relative contribution of the log-transformed outbound variable was 53.68 (range: 39.99 – 67.58) in the 2014 epidemics and 49.79 (range: 33.90 – 56.38) in the 2015 epidemics. In the GLM results, the odds ratio of the log-transformed outbound variable was 1.22 for the 2014 HPAI epidemics (p < 0.001) and 2.48 for the 2015 HPAI epidemics (p < 0.001), respectively. The results indicated that intensive disinfection measures on outbound movement were needed to reduce the risk of HPAI spread. The current BRT models are suitable for risk analysis because the median area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.83 (range: 0.74 – 0.91) and 0.85 (range: 0.73 – 0.87) for the 2014 and 2015 epidemics models, respectively. The Akaike information criterion scores for the multivariate logistic regression of GLM were 150.27 and 78.21 for the 2014 and 2015 epidemics models, respectively. These scores were relatively lower than those from the univariate logistic regression of GLM."

To this end, the agreement rate between the analysis results based on two sentiment analysis tools, ‘Tone analyzer’ and ‘KH-Coder,’ and the correct answers of the 60 target items from the CSATs 1994-2020 was examined. The results of this study show that ‘Tone Analyzer’ has an agreement rate of about 67%, while the agreement rate of ‘KH-Coder’ is about 57%. That is, the result of ‘Tone Analyzer’ adapting a machine learning method is more accurate than that of ‘KH-Coder’, which is based on a sentiment dictionary method. Additionally, sentiment words, possible explicit cues to infer a correct answer, appeared in most of the 60 items. However, in the case of an item where any sentiment words were not directly presented, both sentiment analysis tools mostly failed to find the correct answer. This means that the target item type needs to be developed as an item requiring contextual information to infer in order to reinforce its construct validity. In conclusion, some pedagogical implications and suggestions for future studies are addressed."

We implement programs that can extract meaningful information from the user's dialogue. The meaningful information means the information that the program user wants to obtain. In order to do that, our implementation has two parts. One is the client part, which inputs the keyword of the information that the user wants to obtain, and the other is the server part, which sniffs and performs the speech recognition process. We use the Google Speech API from Google Cloud, which uses machine learning in the speech recognition process. Finally, we discuss the usability and the limitations of the implementation with the example."

Indeed, the problem of bias is often confused with the problem of prejudice (Voruteil) or stereotypes. If the former is a statistical and technical term, the latter is an ethical term. In the process of gathering and processing data, bias is always raised.In this study, the bias of data is divided into the bias of the data itself and the bias of the data processing. In particular, data objectivity and fairness may be at odds with each other. Data objectivity presupposes the correspondence between the data subject and the data. This objectivity can be secured only when subjective intervention is excluded in the process of data acquisition. Nevertheless, even if this modern mechanical objectivity is guaranteed, problems arise that may not be fair. The objectivity of data will be discussed in the process of acquiring data itself, but the fairness of data is more problematic in the use of data.Therefore, in terms of data ethics, the meaning of population bias, data bias, data objectivity, and data fairness should be clearly defined in the process of collecting and using big data."

The focus is on combining existing energy technologies with new information and communication technologies as the Fourth Industrial Revolution approaches. Dyeing and finishing shops use the most energy in the textile industry and have below-average energy efficiency because of low technology and facility investment. Research into increasing the energy efficiency of dyeing and finishing shops has concentrated on developing equipment; however, it is difficult for small- and medium-sized factories to benefit from these advances. Thus, research into means of improving energy efficiency by improving the process and system efficiency of dyeing and finishing companies, who have difficulties with facility investment and operation, is necessary. In this study, a cyber physical energy system that improves the energy efficiency of the dyeing process by collecting and analyzing manufacturing big data was developed. Further, the implemented system was applied to actual dyeing and finishing shops, and its effects were verified.

Human activity recognition with analysis of angles between skeletal joints using a RGB-depth sensor,2020,"['activity recognition', 'dimension reduction', 'Haar-wavelet transform', 'K-nearest neighbour', 'RGB-D sensor']",,"Human activity recognition (HAR) has become effective as a computer vision tool for video surveillance systems. In this paper, a novel biometric system that can detect human activities in 3D space is proposed. In order to implement HAR, joint angles obtained using an RGB-depth sensor are used as features. Because HAR is operated in the time domain, angle information is stored using the sliding kernel method. Haar-wavelet transform (HWT) is applied to preserve the information of the features before reducing the data dimension. Dimension reduction using an averaging algorithm is also applied to decrease the computational cost, which provides faster performance while maintaining high accuracy. Before the classification, a proposed thresholding method with inverse HWT is conducted to extract the final feature set. Finally, the K-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm is used to recognize the activity with respect to the given data. The method compares favorably with the results using other machine learning algorithms."

The significance of this study is that it is a research methodology that combines quantitative methods with existing qualitative methods, as well as an alternative that can reduce the time to analyze sermon contents."
Towards bearing failure prognostics: a practical comparison between datadriven methods for industrial applications,2020,['· Bearing failure prognostics · Deep belief networks · Gaussian process regression · Health indicator construction · Monotonicity'],,"Research studies on data-driven approaches to rotating components and rolling element bearing (REB) prognostics have recently witnessed a rapid increase. These datadriven methods rely on sensor data for condition monitoring and degradation assessments;however, the problem of mining features from these sophisticated data using appropriate intelligent methods and choosing a practically reliable predictive model(s) has become a global concern. Vibration monitoring for REBs have over the years shown great effectiveness.Although monotonic statistical features serve as reliable health indicators (HIs), relying on a single feature for optimal bearing degradation assessment is inefficient. By fusing highly monotonic features using appropriate methods, a more reliable HI can be constructed and from this, various degradation states/stages and time to start prediction (TSP) can be identified by mapping known failure modes/degradation states to cluster points from clustering algorithms.Emphatically, the choice of regression algorithms for prognostics poses more concern as engineers and data scientists are faced with choosing between Bayessian machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods. This study presents a methodology for constructing a reliable HI for bearing prognostics, choosing a reliable TSP, and provides a comparison between ML and DL methods for bearing prognostics. As representatives of both domains, the Gaussian process regression (GPR) and the deep belief network (DBN) are introduced and compared. The results provide a reliable paradigm for prognosible feature representation for REBs and for choosing between both domains while considering their dependencies, efficiencies, and deficiencies."

Human-swarm Interactions for Formation Control Using Interpreters,2020,"['Distributed control', 'dynamic average consensus', 'formation control', 'human-swarm interaction', 'shape morphing dynamics', 'shape planning.']",,"In this work, we develop a novel Human-Swarm Interaction (HSI) framework for formation control using the notion of an interpreter, enabling the user to control a robotic swarm’s shape and formation using abstraction. The user conveys their intended commands by drawing shapes through arm gestures and motions which arerecorded by an off-the-shelf wearable device. We propose a novel interpreter system, which acts as an intermediary between the user and the swarm to simplify the roles of both. The interpreter takes in high level input in the form of shapes drawn by the user, and translates it into swarm control commands by planning in the shape space using novel shape morphing dynamics (SMD), which is also used for user feedback. The proposed interpreter employs machine learning, estimation and optimal control techniques to translate the users intention into swarm control parameters. The dynamics of the swarm are realized by means of a novel decentralized formation controller based on distributed linear iterations and dynamic average consensus. Theoretical guarantees of convergence along with convergence rate of the proposed swarm controller are given. The resulting shape morphing dynamics are illustrated and discussed through simulations. The entire framework is demonstrated theoretically as well as experimentally in a 2D environment, with a human controlling a swarm of simulated robots in real time with the help of a Graphical User Environemnt (GUI)."

This war had many characteristics of modern warfare, such as using machine guns, telegraphy and railroads. In this war the destructive power of weapons grew and the speed of communication and movement became faster, and massive troops were able to operate for several weeks on the front line of 150 km. One notable point in this war is that the result of the main combats or operations was greatly influenced by commands’ military strategic concept or ways of war fighting rather than the superiority of combat power. Also, there were cases where the victor suffered heavier damage than the loser.  The majority of studies on this war in Korea focus on the political backgrounds of the war, military incidents related to Korea, Russia and Japan’s war preparations, or military strategy itself. However, little attention has been paid to the formerly-mentioned phenomena of this war. This research, therefore, focuses on analyzing both Russia and Japan’s military activities in the operational aspect of military strategy. That is, it aims to analyze the ground warfare and military actions in Manchuria while focusing on the effective use of combats for achievement of military goals and the operational viewpoint of military strategy and commands’ operational thinking.  This research has resulted in two findings. First, a military strategy of exchanging territory and force for time is efficient only when it is accompanied by military actions which inflict serious damage on the enemy. Second, repetitive and patterned actions give the enemy an opportunity to learn from and react to them in a creative way.  In conclusion, the commanding officers could have carried out military actions more and efficiently if they had commanded with a better understanding of the transformation of weapons and the change in the size of armed forces, and the creative ways."

Among different renewable resources, photovoltaic power system (PV) is considered as one of the most promising technology, which has the biggest potential for increasing renewable energy. However, its profit can be varied depending on operation and management, which possibly causes performance degradation and safety issues due to faults. Therefore, we have collected actual operation data from the PV monitoring system which located in Changwon, Gyeong-nam province during one year. While most of the PV system has security function which is limited to its inverter protection, in this study, based on fault data software program is developed for fault diagnosis in order to increase robustness of the PV system and minimize operation cost. Also, the program comprises machine learning algorithm based on fault data to classify its types of faults.It also presents economic loss of each PV module considering mean time to repair (MTTR) occurred from the event of faults in the PV system. As a result, the program helps faster fault diagnosis of the PV system and decreasing overall operation cost for the system operator."
Computational estimation of the earthquake response for fibre reinforced concrete rectangular columns,2020,"['ANFIS', 'PSO', 'GA', 'ELM', 'fibre-reinforced concrete', 'Seismic response', 'compressive strength']",,"Due to the impressive flexural performance, enhanced compressive strength and more constrained crack propagation, Fibre-reinforced concrete (FRC) have been widely employed in the construction application. Majority of experimental studies have focused on the seismic behavior of FRC columns. Based on the valid experimental data obtained from the previous studies, the current study has evaluated the seismic response and compressive strength of FRC rectangular columns while following hybrid metaheuristic techniques. Due to the non-linearity of seismic data, Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) has been incorporated with metaheuristic algorithms. 317 different datasets from FRC column tests has been applied as one database in order to determine the most influential factor on the ultimate strengths of FRC rectangular columns subjected to the simulated seismic loading. ANFIS has been used with the incorporation of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic algorithm (GA). For the analysis of the attained results, Extreme learning machine (ELM) as an authentic prediction method has been concurrently used. The variable selection procedure is to choose the most dominant parameters affecting the ultimate strengths of FRC rectangular columns subjected to simulated seismic loading. Accordingly, the results have shown that ANFIS-PSO has successfully predicted the seismic lateral load with R2 = 0.857 and 0.902 for the test and train phase, respectively, nominated as the lateral load prediction estimator. On the other hand, in case of compressive strength prediction, ELM is to predict the compressive strength with R2 = 0.657 and 0.862 for test and train phase, respectively. The results have shown that the seismic lateral force trend is more predictable than the compressive strength of FRC rectangular columns, in which the best results belong to the lateral force prediction. Compressive strength prediction has illustrated a significant deviation above 40 Mpa which could be related to the considerable non-linearity and possible empirical shortcomings. Finally, employing ANFIS-GA and ANFIS-PSO techniques to evaluate the seismic response of FRC are a promising reliable approach to be replaced for high cost and time-consuming experimental tests."
A review of the application of multispectral remote sensing in the study of mangrove ecosystems with special emphasis on image processing techniques,2020,['Remote sensing Sensors Mangrove ecosystem Change detection Stress Vegetation Index'],,"Much progress has been made since the first published report on application of remote sensing in mangrove mapping nearly 40 years ago. Remote sensing is now a widely used proxy in mangrove ecosystem related research mostly due to increased affordability of data and ease of access. This work reviews previous works on mangrove forests using remote sensing techniques with an aim to identify the best combinations of sensors, methods of image processing and vegetation indices for future studies. It was observed that higher accuracies were directly related to sensor resolution and expertise of the authors. From the imageries used, Quickbird had the highest accuracies (* 100%) whereas aerial photos had * 93% accuracy and IRS LISS recorded (76–97%).Accuracies for Landsat images classified using hybrid approaches were up to 88% while AVIRIS and ASTER, gave up to 99% accuracies. Sentinel images also produced very high accuracy levels. Non parametric methods using machine learning techniques produced the highest levels of accuracy (up to 99%). But not all datasets are freely available and the cost of procuring datasets varies from country to country. This suggests that remote sensing of mangrove vegetation pose some serious challenges that require careful considerations in order to obtain better results. An in-depth understanding of the factors affecting the interaction between electro-magnetic radiation and mangrove vegetations in the environment, selection of images with appropriate spatial and spectral resolution and use of proper processing techniques for extracting spectral information is a must. This review paper thus, can be considered as a convenient asset to the researchers involved in assessing the mangrove environment by remote sensing technique."
Evaluating Focal 18F-FDG Uptake in Thyroid Gland with Radiomics,2020,['Thyroid incidentaloma . FDG . PET . Radiomics .

The focal uptake in the thyroid gland was drawn in 3D with 40% SUVmax threshold. Features were extracted from volume of interest (VOI) using the LIFEx package. The features obtained were compared in benign and malignant groups, and statistically significant variables were evaluated by receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis. The correlation between the variables with area under curve (AUC) value over 0.7 was examined; variables with correlation coefficient less than 0.6 were evaluated with machine learning algorithms.Results Sixty patients (70% train set, 30% test set) were included in the study. In univariate analysis, a statistically significant difference was observed in 6 conventional parameters, 5 first-, and 16 second-order features between benign and malignant groups in train set (p < 0.05). The feature with the highest benign-malignant discriminating power was GLRLMRLNU (AUC:0.827). AUC value of SUVmax was calculated as 0.758. GLRLMRLNU and SUVmax were evaluated to build a model to predict the exact pathology outcome. Random forest algorithm showed the best accuracy and AUC (78.6% and 0.849, respectively).Conclusion In the differentiation of benign-malignant thyroid incidentalomas, GLRLMRLNU and SUVmax combination may be more useful than SUVmax to predict the outcome."
Extending TextAE for annotation of non-contiguous entities,2020,"['editor', 'text annotation', 'text mining', 'visualization']",,"Named entity recognition tools are used to identify mentions of biomedical entities in free text and are essential components of high-quality information retrieval and extraction systems. Without good entity recognition, methods will mislabel searched text and will miss important information or identify spurious text that will frustrate users. Most tools do not capture non-contiguous entities which are separate spans of text that together refer to an entity, e.g., the entity ""type 1 diabetes"" in the phrase ""type 1 and type 2 diabetes."" This type is commonly found in biomedical texts, especially in lists, where multiple biomedical entities are named in shortened form to avoid repeating words. Most text annotation systems, that enable users to view and edit entity annotations, do not support non-contiguous entities. Therefore, experts cannot even visualize non-contiguous entities, let alone annotate them to build valuable datasets for machine learning methods. To combat this problem and as part of the BLAH6 hackathon, we extended the TextAE platform to allow visualization and annotation of non-contiguous entities. This enables users to add new subspans to existing entities by selecting additional text. We integrate this new functionality with TextAE's existing editing functionality to allow easy changes to entity annotation and editing of relation annotations involving non-contiguous entities, with importing and exporting to the PubAnnotation format. Finally, we roughly quantify the problem across the entire accessible biomedical literature to highlight that there are a substantial number of non-contiguous entities that appear in lists that would be missed by most text mining systems."
이차원 고객충성도 세그먼트 기반의 고객이탈예측 방법론,2020,"['고객이탈예측', 'CRM', '고객로열티', '고객 빅데이터', 'CCP/2DL', 'Customer Churn Predictive Model', 'Customer Relationship Management', 'Customer Loyalty', 'Customer Big data']",,"Most industries have recently become aware of the importance of customer lifetime value as they are exposed to a competitive environment. As a result, preventing customers from churn is becoming a more important business issue than securing new customers. This is because maintaining churn customers is far more economical than securing new customers, and in fact, the acquisition cost of new customers is known to be five to six times higher than the maintenance cost of churn customers. Also, Companies that effectively prevent customer churn and improve customer retention rates are known to have a positive effect on not only increasing the companys profitability but also improving its brand image by improving customer satisfaction.  Predicting customer churn, which had been conducted as a sub-research area for CRM, has recently become more important as a big data-based performance marketing theme due to the development of business machine learning technology. Until now, research on customer churn prediction has been carried out actively in such sectors as the mobile telecommunication industry, the financial industry, the distribution industry, and the game industry, which are highly competitive and urgent to manage churn. In addition, These churn prediction studies were focused on improving the performance of the churn prediction model itself, such as simply comparing the performance of various models, exploring features that are effective in forecasting departures, or developing new ensemble techniques, and were limited in terms of practical utilization because most studies considered the entire customer group as a group and developed a predictive model. As such, the main purpose of the existing related research was to improve the performance of the predictive model itself, and there was a relatively lack of research to improve the overall customer churn prediction process. In fact, customers in the business have different behavior characteristics due to heterogeneous transaction patterns, and the resulting churn rate is different, so it is unreasonable to assume the entire customer as a single customer group. Therefore, it is desirable to segment customers according to customer classification criteria, such as loyalty, and to operate an appropriate churn prediction model individually, in order to carry out effective customer churn predictions in heterogeneous industries. Of course, in some studies, there are studies in which customers are subdivided using clustering techniques and applied a churn prediction model for individual customer groups. Although this process of predicting churn can produce better predictions than a single predict model for the entire customer population, there is still room for improvement in that clustering is a mechanical, exploratory grouping technique that calculates distances based on inputs and does not reflect the strategic intent of an entity such as loyalties.  This study proposes a segment-based customer departure prediction process (CCP/2DL: Customer Churn Prediction based on Two-Dimensional Loyalty segmentation) based on two-dimensional customer loyalty, assuming that successful customer churn management can be better done through improvements in the overall process than through the performance of the model itself. CCP/2DL is a series of churn prediction processes that segment two-way, quantitative and qualitative loyalty-based customer, conduct secondary grouping of customer segments according to churn patterns, and then independently apply heterogeneous churn prediction models for each churn pattern group. Performance comparisons were performed with the most commonly applied the General churn prediction process and the Clustering-based churn prediction process to assess the relative excellence of the proposed churn prediction process. The General churn prediction process used in this study refers to the process of predicting a single group of customers simply intended to be predic"

It is notable that these films, Spike Jonze’s Her(2014), Denis Villeneuve’s Blade Runner 2049(2017), and Michael Almereyda’s Marjorie Prime(2017) describe artificial intelligence on a everyday and personal level, which was often somewhat exaggerated as a threat in the past science fiction films. Three films as SF genre were produced in the mid-2010s, and at the same time, the artificial intelligence is disembodied or virtual hologram. In addition, it is problematic in that these films set the artificial intelligence as the being who can coexist with human by learning and embodying love, emotional labor, and memory which are human’s own uniqueness. The argument related with aspects of the artificial intelligence as relational being is based on post-human discourse. In this respect, each film explores the possibility of love between humans and artificial intelligence, reveals artificial intelligence’s gendered emotional labor, and checks the possibility that human memory can be reconstructed by artificial intelligence. Through the representation of artificial intelligence, this paper points out that the artificial intelligence’s being and the relationship between human and the machine are linked to post-human thought."

IBN-based: AI-driven Multi-Domain e2e Network Orchestration Approach,2020,"['IBN', 'AI', 'SDN', 'NFV', 'OSM', '5G']",,"Networks are growing faster than ever before causing a multi-domain complexity. The diversity, variety and dynamic nature of network traffic and services require enhanced orchestration and management approaches. While many standard orchestrators and network operators are resulting in an increase of complexity for handling E2E slice orchestration. Besides, there are multiple domains involved in E2E slice orchestration including access, edge, transport and core network each having their specific challenges. Hence, handling of multi-domain, multi-platform and multi-operator based networking environments manually requires specified experts and using this approach it is impossible to handle the dynamic changes in the network at runtime. Also, the manual approaches towards handling such complexity is always error-prone and tedious. Hence, this work proposes an automated and abstracted solution for handling E2E slice orchestration using an intent-based approach. It abstracts the domains from the operators and enable them to provide their orchestration intention in the form of high-level intents. Besides, it actively monitors the orchestrated resources and based on current monitoring stats using the machine learning it predicts future utilization of resources for updating the system states.

This justifies a need for more investigation on methods to improve their behavior and increase their capacity to survive medium to severe loads. A standardized connection could be obtained through investigation on the moment resistance, value of original rotational stiffness, ductility, and failure mode of the connection. A total of six monotonic tests were carried out to determine the behavior of the connection of straight 2.0 mm, and 2.6 mm thickness connects to 5 lug end connectors. Then, the obtained results are benched mark as the original data. Furthermore, an extreme learning machine (ELM) technique has been employed to verify and predict both moment and rotation results. Out of 4 connections, increase the ultimate moment resistance of connection by 13% and 18% for 2.0 mm and 2.6 mm upright connection, respectively."
Implementation of Extracting Specific Information by Sniffing Voice Packet in VoIP,2020,"['Audio', 'VoIP', 'RTP', 'Sniffing', 'STT', 'Speech Recognition']",,"VoIP technology has been widely used for exchanging voice or image data through IP networks. VoIP technology, often called Internet Telephony, sends and receives voice data over the RTP protocol during the session. However, there is an exposition risk in the voice data in VoIP using the RTP protocol, where the RTP protocol does not have a specification for encryption of the original data. We implement programs that can extract meaningful information from the user's dialogue. The meaningful information means the information that the program user wants to obtain. In order to do that, our implementation has two parts. One is the client part, which inputs the keyword of the information that the user wants to obtain, and the other is the server part, which sniffs and performs the speech recognition process. We use the Google Speech API from Google Cloud, which uses machine learning in the speech recognition process. Finally, we discuss the usability and the limitations of the implementation with the example."

In this respect, this study examines the trends regarding the development of social value measurement methods, the methodological differences between agents, and the characteristics of the latest measurement methods.  The development process of social value measurement method began with agents such as governments, international organizations, and non-profit foundations. As various agents develop and implement their own measurement methods, the call for global standardization has increased. The agents can be primarily categorized into international organizations, governments, nonprofit entities, impact investment institutions, consulting firms, and corporate initiatives. The measurement methods differ from agent to agent as the objectives of each are different.  This study considers five characteristics regarding recent social value measurement. First, there is a gradual movement to translate social value in monetary terms to utilize both social and economic values in decision-making. Second, since the 2010s, the international community has emphasized the need for the establishment of global standards for social value measurement. Third, there has been a transition from supplier-oriented measurements to a system that measures the actual change for beneficiaries. Fourth, changes have been made to integrate both social and economic values in reporting rather than social value alone. Lastly, there have been an increase in attempts to collect information via artificial intelligence and machine learning for more accurate measurement.  This is the first research to organize various agents based on their social value measurement methods. It provides insight on the current direction and role of these methods through their characteristics."

The classification accuracy of mobility mode is highly affected by the GPS sampling rate, which has a significant effect on the battery consumption of the device. Therefore, this paper presents a new method to extract mobility features from GPS trajectories for mobility mode classification, and analyze the effect of GPS sampling rate on the classification accuracy and battery consumption. Specifically, we propose features including Heading Change Rate (HCR), Stop Rate (SR), and Velocity Change Rate (VCR) based on moving duration, in addition to statistical features such as velocity, acceleration, and jerk measured from the GPS trajectories.The proposed method is compared with previous work using various machine learning algorithms, and the experiment results show that the proposed method shows 2.3%~3% higher accuracy with random forest classification. Also, the results demonstrate that setting the GPS sampling rate to 10 seconds reduces classification accuracy by 0.6% compared to the highest accuracy, but reduces battery consumption by 33%, minimizing battery consumption without loss of classification accuracy."

It is necessary to introduce educational contents on this problem as an important theme in unification education in schools to deal with the issues of inter-Korean language integration. Differences in vocabulary, phonetics, and speech expressions have been mainly studied as obstacles to language adaptation experienced by North Korean refugees. These problems are difficult to resolve academic issues easily and are still hard tasks requiring long-term efforts. On the other hand, the integration of language norms is a relatively easy-to-access area of social rules, and at the same time, it is a very sensitive issue for North Korean refugees because it causes social stigma and psychological alienation.Using the case of spacing and notation of Saishiot(ㅅ) as the subject matter, the approach to language integration in unification education was reviewed. It was suggested to take care not to become an obstacle to the machine processing of Korean language information while taking complementary integration and emphasizing traditional old native vocabularies as a principle. This approach is easy to harmonize with the trend of unification education in the era of multi-culturalism aiming at promotion of social integration and inspiring self-esteem of all concerned. It will be a case where greater results can be expected when approaching cross-curricular learning under the title of unification education. It is better not to be limited to Korean language education or Korean language education as a foreign language, where it is difficult to easily change the contents of education."

The model was based on an algorithm for selecting the natural frequency in the tension estimation process based on the vibration method and an applied artificial neural network (ANN). The training data of the ANN was composed after converting the cable acceleration data into the frequency, and machine learning was carried out using the characteristics with a pattern on the natural frequency. When developing the training data, the frequencies with various amplitudes can be used to represent the frequencies of multiple shapes to improve the selection performance for natural frequencies. The performance of the model was estimated by comparing it with the control criteria of the tension estimated by an expert. As a result of the verification using 139 frequencies obtained from the cable accelerometer as the input, the natural frequency was determined to be similar to the real criteria and the estimated tension of the cable by the natural frequency was 96.4% of the criteria."

CCTA not only delineates the anatomy of the heart and coronary arteries in detail, but also allows for intra- and extraluminal imaging of coronary arteries. Emerging technologies have promoted new CCTA applications, resulting in a comprehensive assessment of coronary plaques and their clinical significance. The application of computational fluid dynamics to CCTA resulted in a robust tool for noninvasive assessment of coronary blood flow hemodynamics and determination of hemodynamically significant stenosis. Detailed evaluation of plaque morphology and identification of high-risk plaque features by CCTA have been confirmed as predictors of future outcomes, identifying patients at risk for ACSs. With quantitative coronary plaque assessment, the progression of the CAD or the response to therapy could be monitored by CCTA. The aim of this article is to review the future directions of emerging applications in CCTA, such as computed tomography (CT)-fractional flow reserve, imaging of vulnerable plaque features, and quantitative plaque imaging.

A picture showing the relationship between the agent and the object and verbs that could use both ‘-eul’ and ‘-leul’ were presented so that the survey participants could accurately grasp the situation of the discourse. Through this study, the following points were able to be inferred regarding transitivity. First of all, the presence of agents was affecting the expression of transitivity. The choice of ‘-eul/leul’ varies depending on the presence of the agent. It also showed that the transitivity was affected by the meaning of [status] when delivering information about the object. Finally, through the expression of transitivity, we found the possibility of predicting the ability of Korean language learners.

Recently, it is classified as more detailed emotions, not simply positive or negative.In this study, online reviews are used to predict tourist spot, and detailed sentiment analysis is applied. Tourist spot is the most popular destinations for tourists, but tourists' interests may change over time. Monthly sentiment values were used to reflect changes over time. To do this, we used TripAdvisor review data and selected tourist spot compared to the average number of reviews. In order to build a prediction model, input variables were selected as Model 1 classified by 3 emotions (positive, neutral, negative), Model 2 classified by 8 emotions (trust, anticipation, joy, surprise, fear, anger, sadness, disgust), and Model 3 applying both Model 1 and Model 2 classifications. We developed a prediction model for Model 1, Model 2, and Model 3 to predict tourist spot using machine learning techniques such as logit, neural networks, and SVM(Support Vector Machines). As a result, Model 3 using SVM showed the best prediction performance."
다중 클래스 데이터셋의 메타특징이 판별 알고리즘의 성능에 미치는 영향 연구,2020,"['다중 클래스', '판별 알고리즘', '메타 특징', 'HHI', '데이터 복잡성', 'Multi Class', 'Classification Algorithm', 'Meta-Feature', 'Data Complexity']",,"Big data is creating in a wide variety of fields such as medical care, manufacturing, logistics, sales  site, SNS, and the dataset characteristics are also diverse. In order to secure the competitiveness of companies, it is necessary to improve decision-making capacity using a classification algorithm. However, most of them do not have sufficient knowledge on what kind of classification algorithm is appropriate for a specific problem area. In other words, determining which classification algorithm is appropriate depending on the characteristics of the dataset was has been a task that required expertise and effort. This is because the relationship between the characteristics of datasets (called meta-features) and the performance of classification algorithms has not been fully understood. Moreover, there has been little research on meta-features reflecting the characteristics of multi-class. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to empirically analyze whether meta-features of multi-class datasets have a significant effect on the performance of classification algorithms. In this study, meta-features of multi-class datasets were identified into two factors, (the data structure and the data complexity,) and seven representative meta-features were selected. Among those, we included the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), originally a market concentration measurement index, in the meta-features to replace IR(Imbalanced Ratio). Also, we developed a new index called Reverse ReLU Silhouette Score into the meta-feature set.  Among the UCI Machine Learning Repository data, six representative datasets (Balance Scale, PageBlocks, Car Evaluation, User Knowledge-Modeling, Wine Quality(red), Contraceptive Method Choice) were selected. The class of each dataset was classified by using the classification algorithms (KNN, Logistic Regression, Nave Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM) selected in the study. For each dataset, we applied 10-fold cross validation method. 10% to 100% oversampling method is applied for each fold and meta-features of the dataset is measured. The meta-features selected are HHI, Number of Classes, Number of Features, Entropy, Reverse ReLU Silhouette Score, Nonlinearity of Linear Classifier, Hub Score. F1-score was selected as the dependent variable. As a result, the results of this study showed that the six meta-features including Reverse ReLU Silhouette Score and HHI proposed in this study have a significant effect on the classification performance. (1) The meta-features HHI proposed in this study was significant in the classification performance. (2) The number of variables has a significant effect on the classification performance, unlike the number of classes, but it has a positive effect. (3) The number of classes has a negative effect on the performance of classification. (4) Entropy has a significant effect on the performance of classification. (5) The Reverse ReLU Silhouette Score also significantly affects the classification performance at a significant level of 0.01. (6) The nonlinearity of linear classifiers has a significant negative effect on classification performance. In addition, the results of the analysis by the classification algorithms were also consistent. In the regression analysis by classification algorithm, Naïve Bayes algorithm does not have a significant effect on the number of variables unlike other classification algorithms. This study has two theoretical contributions: (1) two new meta-features (HHI, Reverse ReLU Silhouette score) was proved to be significant. (2) The effects of data characteristics on the performance of classification were investigated using meta-features. The practical contribution points (1) can be utilized in the development of classification algorithm recommendation system according to the characteristics of datasets. (2) Many data scientists are often testing by adjusting the parameters of the algorithm to find the optimal algorithm for the situation because the character"
Applications of Computer Modeling and Simulation in Cartilage Tissue Engineering,2020,"['Cartilage', 'Tissue engineering', 'Chondrogenesis', 'Computer modeling', 'In silico']",,"BACKGROUND: Advances in cartilage tissue engineering have demonstrated noteworthy potential for developing cartilage for implantation onto sites impacted by joint degeneration and injury. To supplement resource-intensive in vivo and in vitro studies required for cartilage tissue engineering, computational models and simulations can assist in enhancing experimental design.METHODS: Research articles pertinent to cartilage tissue engineering and computer modeling were identified, reviewed, and summarized. Various applications of computer modeling for cartilage tissue engineering are highlighted, limitations of in silico modeling are addressed, and suggestions for future work are enumerated.RESULTS: Computational modeling can help better characterize shear stresses generated by bioreactor fluid flow, refine scaffold geometry, customize the mechanical properties of engineered cartilage tissue, and model rates of cell growth and dynamics. Thus, results from in silico studies can help resourcefully enhance in vitro and in vivo studies; however, the limitations of these studies, such as the underlying assumptions and simplifications applied in each model, should always be addressed and justified where applicable. In silico models should also seek validation and verification when possible.CONCLUSION: Future studies may adopt similar approaches to supplement in vitro trials and further investigate effects of mechanical stimulation on chondrocyte and stem cell dynamics. Additionally, as precision medicine, machine learning, and powerful open-source software become more popular and accessible, applications of multi-scale and multiphysics computational models in cartilage tissue engineering are expected to increase."
Personalized Psychiatry and Depression: The Role of Sociodemographic and Clinical Variables,2020,"['Depression', 'Personalized medicine', 'Drug targeting', 'Clinical markers', 'Antidepressants', 'Treatment outcome.']",,"Despite several pharmacological options, the clinical outcomes of major depressive disorder (MDD) are often unsatisfactory. Personalized psychiatry attempts to tailor therapeutic interventions according to each patient’s unique profile and characteristics. This approach can be a crucial strategy in improving pharmacological outcomes in MDD and overcoming trial-and-error treatment choices. In this narrative review, we evaluate whether sociodemographic (i.e., gender, age, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status) and clinical [i.e., body mass index (BMI), severity of depressive symptoms, and symptom profiles] variables that are easily assessable in clinical practice may help clinicians to optimize the selection of antidepressant treatment for each patient with MDD at the early stages of the disorder.We found that several variables were associated with poorer outcomes for all antidepressants. However, only preliminary associations were found between some clinical variables (i.e., BMI, anhedonia, and MDD with melancholic/atypical features) and possible benefits with some specific antidepressants. Finally, in clinical practice, the assessment of sociodemographic and clinical variables considered in our review can be valuable for early identification of depressed individuals at high risk for poor responses to antidepressants, but there are not enough data on which to ground any reliable selection of specific antidepressant class or compounds. Recent advances in computational resources, such as machine learning techniques, which are able to integrate multiple potential predictors, such as individual/ clinical variables, biomarkers, and genetic factors, may offer future reliable tools to guide personalized antidepressant choice for each patient with MDD."
