Methods For three children who visited the Korean medicine hospital for growth, BA estimation by the deep learning program and by the specialist in pediatrics of Korean medicine using the TW3 technique was compared, and the time required for estimation was investigated. The change of height, BA, and predicted adult height (PAH) using deep learning program after Korean medicine treatment was observed. Results BA estimation of the left hand bone X-ray by the specialist using the TW3 technique showed a difference of -0.03 to +0.15 years from the estimation by the deep learning program. The mean estimation time was 5 minutes and 49 seconds per one for the specialist and 48 seconds for the deep learning program. During the treatment period, the height percentile and PAH estimated by deep learning program were increased after Korean medicine treatment compared to baseline while acceleration of BA was suppressed compared to chronological age. Conclusions BA estimation using the deep learning program and the TW3 technique showed a difference of less than 0.15 years, and in three cases of patients with growth as the chief complaint, Korean medicine treatment increased height percentile and PAH without accelerating BA maturation."
Reasoning Ability of Deep Learning Models on Tautological Expressions in Korean,2023,"['tautological expression', 'abductive reasoning', 'implicature', 'artificial intelligene', 'BERT', 'Chat-GPT', '항진적 표현', '가추적 추론', '함축', '인공지능', '버트', '챗GPT']",,"The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the abductive reasoning capability of deep learning-based language models, with a specific focus on their ability to infer the meaning of tautological expressions. To achieve this, we conducted two experiments that required language models to understand the meaning of tautological expressions in different contexts. The first experiment was a binary classification task in which the models were presented with preceding sentences as contexts along with a tautological expression, and evaluated the adequacy of the tautological sentence. We employed three BERT-based models and assessed their capability based on the results of human evaluation. The second experiment involved having ChatGPT generate a coherent sentence that followed the preceding sentence and tautological expression. We categorized certain types of errors from the generated sentences that were deemed inappropriate. This study is significant in revealing the limitations of contemporary deep learning-based language models in terms of abductive reasoning and suggests a new task for standardized model evaluation."

In this paper, the noise of the ECG signal was removed using the digital IIR Butterworth low-pass filter. When the performance evaluation of the three activation functions, sigmoid(), ReLU(), and tanh() functions, was compared using the deep learning model of LSTM, it was confirmed that the activation function with the smallest error was the tanh() function. Also, When the performance evaluation and elapsed time were compared for LSTM and GRU models, it was confirmed that the GRU model was superior to the LSTM model."

In this study, we propose an image registration methodology that aligns coordinates between ""VHR (Very High-Resolution) satellite"" images using extracted conjugate points by a self supervised deep learning network. MagicPoint detector is built using a synthetic shape dataset to learn overall characteristics of feature points. The MagicPoint detector is advanced using feature points extracted from various VHR remote sensing open-source datasets. Pseudo-label is generated in the VHR satellite imagery by the advanced MagicPoint detector. At this time, homographic adaptation is applied to consider the various geometric environments. SuperPoint is built using the VHR satellite imagery and the pseudo-label. The image registration is conducted using an estimated non-linear transformation model based on extracted conjugate points through the proposed method.

After these two types of corpora were compiled, each text in the corpora was linguistically analyzed with Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). Since the analysis results had 72 dimensions per text, both PCA and t-SNE (dimensionality reduction techniques in deep learning) were applied for the visualization of results. Then, the results were analyzed. Through the analysis, the following facts were observed: (i) suicide notes could be distinguished from ordinary texts, (ii) even though the same author wrote both types of texts, suicide notes could be distinguished from ordinary texts, and (iii) the novels with the 1<sup>st</sup> person protagonist’s point of view were also different from the suicide notes, though both types of texts preferred to use the 1<sup>st</sup> person pronoun ‘I’."
Chest Radiography of Tuberculosis: Determination of Activity Using Deep Learning Algorithm,2023,"['Chest Radiography', 'Tuberculosis', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Deep Learning Algorithm']",,"Background: Inactive or old, healed tuberculosis (TB) on chest radiograph (CR) is often found in high TB incidence countries, and to avoid unnecessary evaluation and medication, differentiation from active TB is important. This study develops a deep learning (DL) model to estimate activity in a single chest radiographic analysis.Methods: A total of 3,824 active TB CRs from 511 individuals and 2,277 inactive TB CRs from 558 individuals were retrospectively collected. A pretrained convolutional neural network was fine-tuned to classify active and inactive TB. The model was pretrained with 8,964 pneumonia and 8,525 normal cases from the National Institute of Health (NIH) dataset. During the pretraining phase, the DL model learns the following tasks: pneumonia vs. normal, pneumonia vs. active TB, and active TB vs. normal. The performance of the DL model was validated using three external datasets. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed to evaluate the diagnostic performance to determine active TB by DL model and radiologists. Sensitivities and specificities for determining active TB were evaluated for both the DL model and radiologists.Results: The performance of the DL model showed area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.980 in internal validation, and 0.815 and 0.887 in external validation. The AUC values for the DL model, thoracic radiologist, and general radiologist, evaluated using one of the external validation datasets, were 0.815, 0.871, and 0.811, respectively.Conclusion: This DL-based algorithm showed potential as an effective diagnostic tool to identify TB activity, and could be useful for the follow-up of patients with inactive TB in high TB burden countries."
PartitionTuner: An operator scheduler for deep-learning compilers supporting multiple heterogeneous processing units,2023,"['deep neural network', 'deep-learning compiler', 'parallel processing', 'partitioning']",,"Recently, embedded systems, such as mobile platforms, have multiple processing units that can operate in parallel, such as centralized processing units (CPUs) and neural processing units (NPUs). We can use deep-learning compilers to generate machine code optimized for these embedded systems from a deep neural network (DNN). However, the deep-learning compilers proposed so far generate codes that sequentially execute DNN operators on a single processing unit or parallel codes for graphic processing units (GPUs). In this study, we propose PartitionTuner, an operator scheduler for deep-learning compilers that supports multiple heterogeneous PUs including CPUs and NPUs. PartitionTuner can generate an operator-scheduling plan that uses all available PUs simultaneously to minimize overall DNN inference time. Operator scheduling is based on the analysis of DNN architecture and the performance profiles of individual and group operators measured on heterogeneous processing units. By the experiments for seven DNNs, PartitionTuner generates scheduling plans that perform 5.03% better than a static type-based operator-scheduling technique for SqueezeNet. In addition, PartitionTuner outperforms recent profiling-based operator-scheduling techniques for ResNet50, ResNet18, and SqueezeNet by 7.18%, 5.36%, and 2.73%, respectively."

Evaluation of Deep-Learning-Based Very Short-Term Rainfall Forecasts in South Korea,2023,['Deep learning model · Very short-term rainfall forecast · Localized heavy rainfall · South Korea'],,"This study evaluates the performance of a deep learning model, Deep-learning-based Rain Nowcasting and Estimation(DEEPRANE), for very short-term (1–6 h) rainfall forecasts in South Korea. Rainfall forecasts and in-situ observations fromJune–September 2020, when record-breaking summer rainfall was observed in South Korea, are particularly considered.It is found that DEEPRANE adequately predicts moderate rainfall events (MREs;≥1 mm h−1) and strong rainfall events(SREs;≥10 mm h−1) with critical success indices of 0.6 and 0.4 at the 1-h lead time, respectively. The probability of detectionscores of MRE forecasting is higher than the false alarm rates at all lead times, suggesting that DEEPRANE MRE forecastcan be useful even at a long lead time. However, for SRE forecasting, the probability of detection scores becomes smallerthan the false alarm rates at a lead time of 2 h. Localized heavy rainfall events (LHREs,≥30 mm h−1) are also reasonablywell predicted only at a lead time of 2 h. Irrespective of their patterns, the forecast scores systematically decrease with leadtime. This result indicates that DEEPRANE SRE forecast is useful only for nowcasting. DEEPRANE generally shows betterperformance in the early morning hours when rainfall events are more frequent than in other hours. When considering synopticconditions, better performance is found when rainfall events are organized by monsoon rainband rather than caused byextratropical or tropical cyclones. These results suggest that DEEPRANE is especially useful for nowcasting early-morningrainfall events which are embedded in the monsoon rainband."

We constructed 2 separate external datasets consisting of Korean children and adolescents with healthy bone development (Institution 1: n = 343; median age [IQR], 10 [4–15] years; male: female, 183:160; Institution 2: n = 321; median age [IQR], 9 [5–14] years; male: female, 164:157) to test the model performance. The mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and proportions of bone age predictions within 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of the reference age (chronological age) were compared between the Korean model and a commercial model (VUNO Med-BoneAge version 1.1; VUNO) trained with Greulich-Pyle-based age as the label (GP-based model).Results: Compared with the GP-based model, the Korean model showed a lower RMSE (11.2 vs. 13.8 months; P = 0.004) and MAE (8.2 vs. 10.5 months; P = 0.002), a higher proportion of bone age predictions within 18 months of chronological age (88.3% vs. 82.2%; P = 0.031) for Institution 1, and a lower MAE (9.5 vs. 11.0 months; P = 0.022) and higher proportion of bone age predictions within 6 months (44.5% vs. 36.4%; P = 0.044) for Institution 2.Conclusion: The Korean model trained using the chronological ages of Korean children and adolescents without known bone development-affecting diseases/conditions as labels performed better in bone age assessment than the GP-based model in the Korean pediatric population.

Deep-learning-based fault detection and recipe optimization for a plastic injection molding process under the class-imbalance problem,2023,"['deep learning', 'class-imbalance problem', 'fault detection', 'recipe optimization', 'plastic injection molding process']",,"This paper proposes a supervised learning with a class-balancing loss function (SL-CBL) approach for fault detection and feature-similarity-based recipe optimization (FSRO) for a plastic injection molding process. SL-CBL is a novel method that can accurately classify an input sample as a normal or fault condition, even when the training data are severely class-imbalanced. The proposed class-balancing loss function consists of the weighted focal loss and the loss of the F1 score; together, these are used to correctly classify even a small number of faulty samples. SL-CBL is investigated with four classifiers of different structures; the classifiers consist of several fully connected and batch normalization layers. FSRO is an optimization scheme that finds the optimal recipe whose feature is similar to the features of normal samples. The optimal solution is obtained by minimizing the Euclidean distance to the centroid of the normal features. In this research, the proposed SL-CBL and FSRO methods are validated by applying them to an industrial plastic injection molding dataset. The validation results show that the proposed SL-CBL approach achieves the highest F1 score with the lowest misclassification rate, as compared to the alternative methods. When visualizing the feature space, the optimal recipe found by the FSRO scheme was found to be close to the centroid of the normal features, even if the initial recipe is classified as a fault. Furthermore, each variable of the optimized recipe lies within the confidence interval of 3${\rm{\sigma }}$ for the normal condition. This indicates that the optimal recipe is statistically similar to the normal samples."

This study proposes range-adaptive distributed power control (Ra-DPC) based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with the Monte Carlo policy gradient algorithm. A key finding is that the agents learn Ra-DPC more effectively when the cumulative interference power of the subchannels is adopted as the state of the DRL model, rather than the channel busy ratio. The proposed Ra-DPC algorithm performs better in energy efficiency and packet delivery ratio than the existing technologies."
A deep-learning method using single phantom to enhance megavoltage image quality for patient positioning in chest radiotherapy: a feasibility study,2023,['Deep learning · Megavoltage image · Kilovoltage image · Radiotherapy · Patient setup'],,"Image-guided radiation treatment (IGRT) is essential for verifying patient positioning during modern radiotherapy. Although megavoltage digital radiographs (MV-DR) are available on most therapeutic linear accelerators and can be used for checking treatment beam shapes, they are much inferior to kilovoltage digital radiographs (KV-DR) in terms of image quality. As it is generally challenging to obtain a well-aligned MV−KV training dataset of patients in clinical scenarios, there is a lack of sufcient information on the accuracy of KV-DR synthesized using supervised training. Therefore, we aimed to synthesize pseudo KV-DR (pKV-DR) from MV-DR using a training dataset developed with a single anthropomorphic chest phantom.The phantom was adopted to obtain MV−KV image pairs at various gantry angles because these image pairs of patients are highly difcult to acquire and exactly align with each other. A deep-learning model based on U-net architecture was trained with the phantom image pairs using the mean absolute error (MAE) and structure similarity (SSIM) indices as loss functions.The mean MAEs of MV-DR and pKV-DR against KV-DR as the ground truth were 0.1152 and 0.0169, respectively, and their mean SSIM values were 0.9693 and 0.9942, respectively. Finally, pKV-DR showed a relatively high image similarity to that of KV-DR with smaller MAE (14.7%) and higher SSIM (2.5%), compared with MV-DR. The image contrast was also improved by 37.1% in clinical cases. The proposed method is expected to enable the implementation of improved IGRT with high image quality of KV-DR level, even in clinics where MV-DR is only available."

However, the number of farms and farmers producing meat decrease during the same period, reducing meat sufficiency. Information and Communications Technology (ICT) has begun to be applied to reduce labor and production costs of livestock farms and improve productivity. This technology can be used for rapid pregnancy diagnosis of sows; the location and size of the gestation sacs of sows are directly related to the productivity of the farm. In this study, a system proposes to determine the number of gestation sacs of sows from ultrasound images. The system used the YOLOv7-E6E model, changing the activation function from sigmoid-weighted linear unit (SiLU) to a multi-activation function (SiLU + Mish). Also, the upsampling method was modified from nearest to bicubic to improve performance. The model trained with the original model using the original data achieved mean average precision of 86.3%. When the proposed multi-activation function, upsampling, and AutoAugment were applied, the performance improved by 0.3%, 0.9%, and 0.9%, respectively. When all three proposed methods were simultaneously applied, a significant performance improvement of 3.5% to 89.8% was achieved."

The following images were compared: SBH-SSFSE with (SBH-DLR) and without (SBHconventional reconstruction [CR]) DLR and MBH-SSFSE with (MBH-DLR) and without (MBH-CR) DLR.Two radiologists independently reviewed the overall image quality, artifacts, sharpness, and motion-related signal loss using a 5-point scale. Three inflammatory parameters were evaluated in the ileum, the terminal ileum, and the colon. Moreover, the presence of a spatial misalignment was evaluated.Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was calculated at two locations for each sequence.Results DLR significantly improved the image quality, artifacts, and sharpness of the SBH images. No significant differences in scores between MBH-CR and SBH-DLR were detected. SBH-DLR had the highest SNR (p < 0.001). The inter-reader agreement for inflammatory parameters was good to excellent (κ = 0.76–0.95) and the inter-sequence agreement was nearly perfect (κ = 0.92–0.94). Misalignment artifacts were observed more frequently in the MBH images than in the SBH images (p < 0.001).Conclusion SBH-DLR demonstrated equivalent quality and performance compared to MBH-CR. Furthermore, it can be acquired in less than half the time, without multiple BHs and reduce slice misalignments."

Although deep-learning techniques are popularly used for apple detection, the development of robust models that can accord information about the fruit’s occlusion condition is important to plan a suitable strategy for end-eff ector manipulation.Apples on the tree experience occlusions due to leaves, stems (branches), trellis wire, or other fruits during robotic harvesting.Methods A novel two-stage deep-learning-based approach is proposed and successfully demonstrated for detecting ontree apples and identifying their occlusion condition. In the fi rst stage, the system employs a cutting-edge YOLOv7 model, meticulously trained on a custom Kashmiri apple orchard image dataset. The second stage of the approach utilize the powerful Effi cientNet-B0 model; the system is able to classify the apples into four distinct categories based on their occlusion condition, namely, non-occluded, leaf-occluded, stem/wire-occluded, and apple-occluded apples.Results The YOLOv7 model achieved an average precision of 0.902 and an F1-score of 0.905 on a test set for detecting apples. The size of the trained weights and detection speed were observed to be 284 MB and 0.128 s per image. The classifi cation model produced an overall accuracy of 92.22% with F1-scores of 94.64%, 90.91%, 86.87%, and 90.25% for nonoccluded, leaf-occluded, stem/wire-occluded, and apple-occluded apple classes, respectively.Conclusion This study proposes a novel two-stage model for the simultaneous detection of on-tree apples and classify them based on occlusion conditions, which could improve the eff ectiveness of autonomous apple harvesting and avoid potential damage to the end-eff ector due to the objects causing the occlusion."
An Intercomparison of Deep‑Learning Methods for Super‑Resolution Bias‑Correction (SRBC) of Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) Using CORDEX‑SA Simulations,2023,['Regional climate · Indian monsoon · Climate change · Deep learning'],,"The Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) plays a significant role in India’s agriculture and economy. Our understandingof the climate dynamics of the Indian summer monsoon has been enriched with general circulation models (GCMs)and regional climate models (RCMs). Systematic bias associated with these numerical simulations, however, needs to becorrected before we can obtain accurate or reliable projections of the future. Therefore, this study applies two state-of-theartdeep-learning (DL)-based super-resolution bias correction (SRBC) methods, viz. Autoencoder-Decoder (ACDC) and adeeper network Residual Neural Network (ResNet) to perform spatial downscaling and bias-correction on high-resolutionCORDEX-SA climatic simulations of precipitation. To do so, we obtained eight meteorological variables from CORDEXSARCM simulations along with a digital elevation model at a spatial resolution of 0.25°×0.25° as input. Indian MonsoonData Assimilation and Analysis, precipitation reanalysis re-grided to 0.05°×0.05° spatial resolution is chosen as output forthe training period 1979–2005. To evaluate the DL algorithms, the RCP 2.6 scenario of CORDEX-SA future simulationsfor the period 2006–2020 is chosen. Moreover, we also conducted a performance assessment of the representation of mean,variability, extreme, and frequency of rainfall associated with ISMR. The results of the experiments show that the DL methodResNet a highly efficient in (i) improving the spatial resolution of the climatic simulations from 0.25°×0.25° to 0.05°×0.05°,(ii) reducing the systematic biases of the extreme rainfall of ISMR from 21.18 mm to -7.86 mm, and (iii) providing a robustbias-corrected climate simulation of ISMR for future climate mitigation and adaptation studies."
Analysis of the Interdecadal and Interannual Variability of Autumn Extreme Rainfall in Taiwan Using a Deep-Learning-Based Weather Typing Approach,2023,['Climate variability · Extreme rainfall · Weather type · Deep neural network · ENSO · PDO'],,"This study sought to assess the interdecadal and interannual variability of autumn extreme rainfall (ER) in Taiwan from 1979to 2019. Three types of ER events were identified based on a clustering analysis augmented by a deep autoencoder-basedneural network model. This method outperforms other methods in obtaining the optimal number of clusters by extractingthe synoptic features in advance. The patterns associated with these three types include a tropical cyclone covering Taiwan(TC), a TC-like circulation in the South China Sea (SCS) accompanied by northeasterly near northern Taiwan (TC-NE), andnortheasterly near northern Taiwan (NE). The differences in the rainfall pattern caused by the three types were discernableover Taiwan. How the PDO or ENSO modulates the regional large-scale environment to favor the occurrence of these ERevents was investigated. The occurrence of TC-NE events was simultaneously correlated with the negative phases of PDO/ENSO in the interdecadal/interannual scale. In the negative phases of PDO/ENSO, a low-level anomalous cyclone overSCS accompanied by background northeasterly favored the regional TC activities and may cause more TC-NE events. Theoccurrence of NE events is simultaneously correlated with the cold phase of ENSO. An anomalous low-level anticyclone inNortheast Asia strengthened the northeasterly toward northern Taiwan, and with the seasonal background moisture, providedfavorable conditions for the occurrence of the NE events. Overall, the occurrence of the TC events did not correlate with thePDO or ENSO signals; the reasons for the lack of correlation were discussed herein."
Image Classification Algorithm Based on Proposal Region Clustering Learning-Unsupervised Deep Learning,2023,"['Proposal cluster learning', 'Unsupervised learning', 'Multiple instance learning', 'Deep learning', 'Image classification']",,"Although deep learning has achieved certain results in image classification, images are susceptible to factors such as lighting conditions, shooting angles, complex backgrounds, rotation transformations or scale scaling, and image data sets in some areas are difficult to obtain. They make the deep learning framework unable to give full play to its generalization ability and nonlinear modeling ability in image classification. Therefore, this paper first proposes a proposal region clustering learning algorithm, which clusters the proposal regions in each image so that each cluster corresponds to the category of the image. Then, different clusters can be regarded as different multi-instance learning packets, and each packet uses the multi-instance learning method to learn the unsupervised image classification detector. It can effectively improve the generalization and modeling capabilities of deep learning models. In addition, this paper proposes an unsupervised deep learning method, which designs an unsupervised deep learning network structure and loss function according to the characteristics of the classified image, and combines densely connected blocks to extract features from the source image. It retains the multi-scale features of the middle layer of the classified image, and effectively solves the problem of insufficient image feature extraction information caused by the lack of image data. It also guarantees the accuracy of subsequent image classification. The experimental results show that the image classification method proposed in this paper not only solves the problem of insufficient image data sets and the interference of various complex factors, but also can accurately classify various image data sets. The accuracy of the image classification method proposed in this paper is 1.38–19% higher than other mainstream deep learning methods."
A Modified Stochastic Gradient Descent Optimization Algorithm With Random Learning Rate for Machine Learning and Deep Learning,2023,"['Deep learning', 'machine learning', 'modified stochastic gradient descent', 'random learning rate', 'steepest descent algorithm.']",,"An optimization algorithm is essential for minimizing loss (or objective) functions in machine learning and deep learning. Optimization algorithms face several challenges, one among which is to determine an appropriate learning rate. Generally, a low learning rate leads to slow convergence whereas a large learning rate causes the loss function to fluctuate around the minimum. As a hyper-parameter, the learning rate is determined in advance before parameter training, which is time-consuming. This paper proposes a modified stochastic gradient descent (mSGD) algorithm that uses a random learning rate. Random numbers are generated for a learning rate at every iteration, and the one that gives the minimum value of the loss function is chosen. The proposed mSGD algorithm can reduce the time required for determining the learning rate. In fact, the k-point mSGD algorithm can be considered as a kind of steepest descent algorithm. In a real experiment using the MNIST dataset of hand-written digits, it is demonstrated that the convergence performance of mSGD algorithm is much better than that of the SGD algorithm and slightly better than that of the AdaGrad and Adam algorithms."
Forecasting Fish Import Using Deep Learning: A Comprehensive Analysis of Two Different Fish Varieties in South Korea,2023,"['Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning', 'Artificial Neural Network', 'Long Short-Term Memory', 'Prediction']",,"Nowadays, Deep Learning (DL) technology is being used in several government departments. South Korea imports a lot of seafood. If the demand for fishery products is not accurately predicted, then there will be a shortage of fishery products and the price of the fishery product may rise sharply. So, South Korea’s Ministry of Ocean and Fisheries is attempting to accurately predict seafood imports using deep learning. This paper introduces the solution for the fish import prediction in South Korea using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method. It was found that there was a huge gap between the sum of consumption and export against the sum of production especially in the case of two species that are Hairtail and Pollock. An import prediction is suggested in this research to fill the gap with some advanced Deep Learning methods. This research focuses on import prediction using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning methods to predict the import amount more precisely. For the prediction, two Deep Learning methods were chosen which are Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Moreover, the Machine Learning method was also selected for the comparison between the DL and ML. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was selected for the error measurement which shows the difference between the predicted and actual values. The results obtained were compared with the average RMSE scores and in terms of percentage. It was found that the LSTM has the lowest RMSE score which showed the prediction with higher accuracy. Meanwhile, ML’s RMSE score was higher which shows lower accuracy in prediction. Moreover, Google Trend Search data was used as a new feature to find its impact on prediction outcomes. It was found that it had a positive impact on results"
Deep Learning-Based Computed Tomography Image Standardization to Improve Generalizability of Deep Learning-Based Hepatic Segmentation,2023,"['Artificial intelligence', 'Automated segmentation', 'Image conversion', 'Quality control', 'Reproducibility']",,"Objective: We aimed to investigate whether image standardization using deep learning-based computed tomography (CT) image conversion would improve the performance of deep learning-based automated hepatic segmentation across various reconstruction methods. Materials and Methods: We collected contrast-enhanced dual-energy CT of the abdomen that was obtained using various reconstruction methods, including filtered back projection, iterative reconstruction, optimum contrast, and monoenergetic images with 40, 60, and 80 keV. A deep learning based image conversion algorithm was developed to standardize the CT images using 142 CT examinations (128 for training and 14 for tuning). A separate set of 43 CT examinations from 42 patients (mean age, 10.1 years) was used as the test data. A commercial software program (MEDIP PRO v2.0.0.0, MEDICALIP Co. Ltd.) based on 2D U-NET was used to create liver segmentation masks with liver volume. The original 80 keV images were used as the ground truth. We used the paired t-test to compare the segmentation performance in the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and difference ratio of the liver volume relative to the ground truth volume before and after image standardization. The concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) was used to assess the agreement between the segmented liver volume and ground-truth volume. Results: The original CT images showed variable and poor segmentation performances. The standardized images achieved significantly higher DSCs for liver segmentation than the original images (DSC [original, 5.40%-91.27%] vs. [standardized, 93.16%-96.74%], all P < 0.001). The difference ratio of liver volume also decreased significantly after image conversion (original, 9.84%-91.37% vs. standardized, 1.99%-4.41%). In all protocols, CCCs improved after image conversion (original, -0.006-0.964 vs. standardized, 0.990-0.998). Conclusion: Deep learning-based CT image standardization can improve the performance of automated hepatic segmentation using CT images reconstructed using various methods. Deep learning-based CT image conversion may have the potential to improve the generalizability of the segmentation network."

Performance of deep learning approaches for detection and classification of ceramic tile defects,2023,"['Deep learning', 'Classification', 'Ceramic tile images', 'VGG model', 'CNN.']",,"Ceramic tiles are in high demand in the infrastructure and building development industries due to their low cost, ease ofinstallation, maintenance, moisture resistance, and availability in a broad range of colors, textures, and sizes. Automatedfacilities, which produce hundreds of tiles in every segment, require a tremendous volume of output. Because of the largenumber of tiles produced and the frequency with which they are produced, it is impossible to manually examine them forfaults, necessitating the use of a rapid, efficient, and reliable automated process. However, while the process of detecting flawsand categorizing them (or classification) is not as efficient as it might be, recent advances in computing technology,mathematical modeling, and high-resolution picture capture equipment have given rise to new prospects in the subject. Manykinds of literature on using these systems for the same goal are currently accessible. Deep learning is a type of artificialintelligence that helps people makes decisions. In production applications, image detection of faulty Ceramic Tile Surfaces isa critical skill. Deep learning is now being studied for its potential application in automated defect identification.

A Study on the Development of Deep Learning Algorithm for Determining External Quality of Welded Parts Using Transfer Learning,2023,"['Weld quality', 'Weld appearance', 'Deep learning', 'CNN (Convolution Neural Network)', 'ResNet']",,"Recently, deep learning has been applied to various welding techniques, such as laser welding, gas metal arc welding (GMAW), and resistance spot welding, and research on automation and quality prediction is being conducted.Even for GMAW, many researchers have attempted to predict quality through X-ray, current, and voltage measurements. If judgment in real time is not necessary, it is most effective to judge the quality of a welded part using an exterior image. Therefore, in this study, a welded appearance quality judgment model was analyzed using image deep learning. Welding defects were classified into pores, overlaps, craters, melting of the base material, cracks, and undercuts, and were divided into 7 categories including normal ones. In constructing the deep-learning model, transfer learning was performed using existing networks, such as ResNet and AlexNet. To improve the accuracy of deep learning, tests were performed while the optimization technique, maximum number of epochs, and minibatch size were changed. It was confirmed that the accuracy of weld defect prediction improved as the minibatch size increased, and the stochastic gradient descent model had the highest accuracy. Increasing the number of data for learning should make the technique of using images to judge the quality of GMAW welds using the proposed model more widely applicable."

Mask images were generated by manually segmenting the craniofacial bone using a commercial segmentation program. Among them, 35 ZTE series were used to train the three-dimensional (3D)-nnUnet deep learning model and the remaining three series were used for model validation. A temporally different dataset of 19 ZTE bone MRIs obtained in May 2022 from infants and children (age range, 3–168 months) was used to determine the model’s performance. Dice similarity coefficient was calculated for each test case. From 3D volume rendering images, segmentation accuracy, overall image quality, and visibility of cranial sutures were subjectively evaluated on a 5-point scale and compared with ground truth data from manual segmentation. Reasons for segmentation failure were analyzed using axially segmented ZTE images.Results: For the test set, the mean Dice similarity coefficient was 0.985 ± 0.019. The segmentation accuracy was lower than the ground truth without showing a statistically significant difference between the two (3.39 ± 1.11 vs. 3.73 ± 0.77, p = 0.055). The overall image quality and suture visibility showed no significant difference (3.34 ± 0.75 vs. 3.42 ± 0.69, p = 0.317; 3.55 ± 0.97 vs. 3.60 ± 0.95, p = 0.157). Common reasons for low segmentation accuracy were well-pneumatized sinuses, metal artifacts, skin at the vertex level, and bones too thin.Conclusion: The deep learning-based automatic segmentation technique of bone ZTE MRIs showed comparable segmentation performance to manual segmentation. Using the deep learning-based segmentation results, acceptable 3D-volume rendering images of craniofacial bones were generated."
Preliminary study on PET detector digital positioning of scintillation pixels using deep learning,2023,['Positron emission tomography · Detector · Scintillation pixel positioning · Deep learning'],,"In a positron emission tomography detector, the process required to measure the position of a specifc scintillation pixel where gamma rays interact with a pixel is somewhat complex. It is necessary to acquire food images, segment them, and classify and organize them by region. When a new incident gamma ray is assigned to a corresponding area through position reconstruction of a signal generated, it is considered to have interacted with a specifc scintillation pixel. In this work, a study was conducted using deep learning to simplify the position measurement of scintillation pixels that interact with gamma rays through various steps. A deep learning model was trained using the ratio of the signal for each position of the scintillation pixel obtained through simulation. The experimental data were converted into a signal ratio and used as an input value, and the position of the scintillation pixel was directly measured as a digital signal. After segmentation of the food image, the data for each region of each scintillation pixel were applied to the deep learning-based position measurement method to evaluate the accuracy of the position measured by deep learning. The proposed method achieved an average accuracy of 96.98%, and the position of the error was mainly at the point where the areas were split. The convenience of image reconstruction can be improved in existing detectors by this method of specifying the position of the scintillation pixel through deep learning."

The main idea revolves around the identification of discontinuity areas in the 3D digital model of a tunnel face by segmenting its 2D projected images using a deep-learning semantic segmentation model called U-Net. The proposed deep learning model integrates various features including the projected RGB image, depth map image, and local surface properties-based images i.e., normal vector and curvature images to effectively segment areas of discontinuity in the images. Subsequently, the segmentation results are projected back onto the 3D model using depth maps and projection matrices to obtain an accurate repre- sentation of the location and extent of discontinuities within the 3D space. The performance of the segmentation model is evaluated by comparing the segmented results with their corresponding ground truths, which demonstrates the high accuracy of segmentation results with the intersection-over-union metric of approximately 0.8. Despite still being limited in training data, this method exhibits promising potential to address the limitations of conven- tional approaches, which only rely on normal vectors and unsupervised machine learning algorithms for grouping points in the 3D model into distinct sets of discontinuities."

Deep learning-based impact locating using the power spectrum of an acceleration signal on a cantilever beam,2023,['· Deep learning · Impact locating · Signal detection · Structural vibration · Deep neural network'],,"This study proposes a deep neural network-based impact locating method on a cantilever beam. The power spectrum of a measured acceleration signal, when an impact is exerted at an arbitrary location on the beam, contains the inherent frequency response of the beam, including resonances and anti-resonances. Especially, the anti-resonances can be a useful feature for estimating the impact location because they are dominated by both the sensor and impact locations. However, in the power spectrum expressed using a linear scale, these anti-resonances may be less noticeable due to their small values relative to the resonances. The proposed impact locating method adopts the power spectrum expressed using a dB scale to highlight the importance of the anti-resonances as the input of a deep neural network. The deep neural network was trained, validated, and tested using a simulated dataset derived from an ideal cantilever beam model with a length of 800 mm, including a single accelerometer. From the test result, the proposed method achieved a root mean square error of about 1 mm in impact locating for a total of 800 impact locations with an interval of 1 mm, a significantly improved accuracy from that using the linear scaled power spectrum."

Depth maps or depth images are single image metric whichcarries the information in three-dimensional axes, i.e., xyz coordinates, where z is the object’s distance from cameraaxes. For many applications, including augmented reality, object tracking, segmentation, scene reconstruction,distance measurement, autonomous navigation, and autonomous driving, depth estimation is a fundamental task.Much of the work has been done to calculate depth maps. We reviewed the status of depth map estimation usingdifferent techniques from several papers, study areas, and models applied over the last 20 years. We surveyeddifferent depth-mapping techniques based on traditional ways and newly developed deep-learning methods. Theprimary purpose of this study is to present a detailed review of the state-of-the-art traditional depth mappingtechniques and recent deep learning methodologies. This study encompasses the critical points of each methodfrom different perspectives, like datasets, procedures performed, types of algorithms, loss functions, and well-known evaluation metrics. Similarly, this paper also discusses the subdomains in each method, like supervised,unsupervised, and semi-supervised methods. We also elaborate on the challenges of different methods. At theconclusion of this study, we discussed new ideas for future research and studies in depth map research."
Deep Learning-based Prediction of Axial Length Using Ultra-widefield Fundus Photography,2023,[],,"Purpose: To develop a deep learning model that can predict the axial lengths of eyes using ultra-widefield (UWF) fundus photography.Methods: We retrospectively enrolled patients who visited the ophthalmology clinic at the Seoul National University Hospitalbetween September 2018 and December 2021. Patients with axial length measurements and UWF images taken within 3months of axial length measurement were included in the study. The dataset was divided into a development set and a testset at an 8:2 ratio while maintaining an equal distribution of axial lengths (stratified splitting with binning). We used transferlearning-based on EfficientNet B3 to develop the model. We evaluated the model’s performance using mean absolute error(MAE), R-squared (R2), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used vanilla gradient saliency maps to illustrate the regions predominantlyused by convolutional neural network.Results: In total, 8,657 UWF retinal fundus images from 3,829 patients (mean age, 63.98 ±15.25 years) were included in thestudy. The deep learning model predicted the axial lengths of the test dataset with MAE and R2 values of 0.744 mm (95% CI,0.709-0.779 mm) and 0.815 (95% CI, 0.785-0.840), respectively. The model’s accuracy was 73.7%, 95.9%, and 99.2% in prediction,with error margins of ±1.0, ±2.0, and ±3.0 mm, respectively.Conclusions: We developed a deep learning-based model for predicting the axial length from UWF images with good performance."
A Study on Impact of Deep Learning on Korean Economic Growth Factor,2023,"['Deep learning', 'Korean economy growth', 'Economic growth factors', 'Economy.']",,"This paper deals with studying strategy about impact of deep learning (DL) on the factor of Korean economic growth. To study classification of impact factors of Korean economic growth, we suggest dynamic equation of microeconomy and study methods on economic growth impact of deep learning. Next step is to suggest DL model to dynamic equation with Korean economy data with growth related factors to classify what factor is import and dominant factors to build policy and education. DL gives an influence in many areas because it can be implemented with ease as just normal editing works and speak including code development by using huge data. Currently, young generations will take a big impact on their job selection because generative AI can do well as much as humans can do it everywhere. Therefore, policy and education methods should be rearranged as new paradigm. However, government and officers do not understand well how it is serious in policy and education. This paper provides method of policy and education for AI education including generative AI through analysing many papers and reports, and experience."
Systematic review of automated sleep apnea detection based on physiological signal data using deep learning algorithm: a meta-analysis approach,2023,"['CNN', 'DBN', 'Deep learning', 'GRU', 'LSTM', 'Sleep apnea']",,"Sleep apnea (SLA) is a respiratory-related sleep disorder that affects a major proportion of the population. The gold standard in sleep testing, polysomnography, is costly, inconvenient, and unpleasant, and it requires a skilled professional to score. Multiple researchers have suggested and developed automated scoring processes with less detectors and automated classification algorithms to resolve these problems. An automatic detection system will allow for a high diagnosis rate and the analysis of additional patients. Deep learning (DL) is achieving high priority due to the availability of databases and recently developed methods. As the most up-and-coming technique for classification and generative tasks, DL has shown its significant potential in 2-dimensional clinical image processing studies. However, physiological information collected as 1-dimensional data has yet to be effectively extracted from this new approach to achieve the needed medical goals. So, in this study, we review the most recent studies in the field of DL applied to physiological data based on pulse oxygen saturation, electrocardiogram, airflow, and sound signal. A total of 47 articles from different journals and publishing houses that were published between 2012 and 2022 were identified. The primary objective of this work is to perform a comprehensive analysis to analyze, classify, and compare the main characteristics of deep-learning algorithms applied in physiological data processing for SLA detection. Overall, our analysis provides comprehensive and detailed information for researchers looking to add to this field. The data input source, objective, DL network, training framework, and database references are the critical factors of the DL approach examined. These are the most critical variables that influence system performance. We categorized the relevant research studies in physiological sensor data analysis using the DL approach based on (1) Physiological sensor data aspects, like signal types, sampling frequency, and window size; and (2) DL model perspectives, such as learning structure and input data types."
Review on Deep Learning Methods for Malware Detection,2023,"['Cyber Security', 'Deep Learning', 'Malware Detection', 'Malicious Code', 'Malicious Code Detection']",,"With the advancement of information and communication technology (ICT) and the emergence of big data analysis, the analysis of malicious codes has become a crucial issue. The convergence of robot technology, artificial intelligence, and ICT has paved the way for innovative solutions in this domain. However, as the significance of information increases, so does the invasion of privacy due to the vast volume of data. Consequently, cybersecurity problems, including attacks by malicious codes, have become a severe concern. Malicious code refers to code written and executed with malicious intent, and it poses a significant security risk. Traditional approaches to defend against malicious code have relied on pattern-based and heuristic-based techniques. Although these methods have been effective, they often fall short in addressing variants of malicious codes or zero-day threats. To overcome these limitations, researchers have actively explored the application of deep learning techniques for the detection of malicious code. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the recent research trends in the detection and classification of malicious codes using deep learning."
Designing container crane control learning model using deep learning,2023,"['Automated container terminal', 'Container crane automation', 'Deep learning', 'LSTM', 'GRU', 'Force prediction']",,"Ports are crucial infrastructure in the global supply chain, and the digitalization and automation of ports have been recently promoted worldwide. Container terminals face increasing competition owing to expanding ships and increasing container throughput. Quay area container cranes are the key equipment for container loading and unloading; however, their level of automation is lower than those of yard cranes and automated guided vehicles (AGVs). Additionally, they have persistent issues such as variations in work speed depending on the operator's skill, potential human error, and the time and cost required for training and education to generate skilled personnel. This study designed a deep learning-based container crane control model to predict the input force values applied to the trolley and hoist to move a container to the target position, when its initial position, target position, and weight are provided. We designed a container crane simulator that emulates a skilled operator handling a container. Data on the trolley and hoist force values were collected for 1,008 cases with different initial positions, target positions, and weights. The recurrent neural network, long short-term memory, and gated recurrent unit (GRU) models were designed to learn the relationship between the target trajectory of the container and the input force values of the trolley and hoist. These values were predicted for three different vessel operation scenarios with different initial positions, target positions, and weights to evaluate the model performance. The GRU container crane control learning model exhibited high prediction accuracy for the input force values of the trolley and hoist. A dynamic simulation confirmed that the container crane could be controlled to move from the initial to the target position."
Hybrid model-based and deep learning-based metal artifact reduction method in dental cone-beam computed tomography,2023,"['CBCT', 'Metal artifact reduction', 'Beam-hardening correction', 'Reconstruction', 'Polychromatic X-ray attenuation coefficient', 'Deep learning']",,"Objective: To present a hybrid approach that incorporates a constrained beam-hardening estimator (CBHE) and deep learning (DL)-based post-refinement for metal artifact reduction in dental cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT).Methods: Constrained beam-hardening estimator (CBHE) is derived from a polychromatic X-ray attenuation model with respect to X-ray transmission length, which calculates associated parameters numerically. Deep-learning-based post-refinement with an artifact disentanglement network (ADN) is performed to mitigate the remaining dark shading regions around a metal. Artifact disentanglement network (ADN) supports an unsupervised learning approach, in which no paired CBCT images are required. The network consists of an encoder that separates artifacts and content and a decoder for the content. Additionally, ADN with data normalization replaces metal regions with values from bone or soft tissue regions. Finally, the metal regions obtained from the CBHE are blended into reconstructed images.The proposed approach is systematically assessed using a dental phantom with two types of metal objects for qualitative and quantitative comparisons.Results: The proposed hybrid scheme provides improved image quality in areas surrounding the metal while preserving native structures.Conclusion: This study may significantly improve the detection of areas of interest in many dentomaxillofacial applications."
Automatic Classification Method for Oracle Images based on Deep Learning,2023,"['K-means algorithm', 'Deep learning', 'Oracle images', 'Self-defined classification', 'Transfer learning', 'Convolutional neural network']",,"There are some problems in oracle image classification, such as high image-feature extraction error and low classification accuracy, which leads to low efficiency. Therefore, we designed an automatic classification method for oracle images based on deep learning. The clustering center of an oracle image is determined using k-means algorithm. The obtained oracle image block is used as parallel input to extract a dictionary. The oracle image features are output through a feature mapping function for feature extraction. The CS algorithm is used to reduce the dimension of the oracle image, and the oracle feature compressed sensing signal is sparse under a certain basis for preprocessing of image features. The center of six feature points in the features is used to describe the center of the feature points of the whole oracle image, to determine the position change state of the feature points, and to characterize the key features of the image to achieve the target alignment of oracle image feature points. Based on this, the image feature data are learned using a transfer learning model. The automatic classifier was constructed through a convolution neural network. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the error of image feature extraction and improve the classification accuracy. At the application level, the research results of this paper have brought great improvement to the performance of oracle image classification technology. At the theoretical level, this research introduces k-means and CS algorithms to oracle image classification technology based on deep learning and makes an effective exploration in the direction of this technological progress."
Predicting Session Conversion on E-commerce: A Deep Learning-based Multimodal Fusion Approach,2023,"['Purchase Conversion', 'Multimodal Fusion', 'Clickstream Data', 'Rfmc', 'Deep Learning']",,"With the availability of big customer data and advances in machine learning techniques, the prediction of customer behavior at the session-level has attracted considerable attention from marketing practitioners and scholars. This study aims to predict customer purchase conversion at the session-level by employing customer profile, transaction, and clickstream data. For this purpose, we develop a multimodal deep learning fusion model with dynamic and static features (i.e., DS-fusion). Specifically, we base page views within focal visist and recency, frequency, monetary value, and clumpiness (RFMC) for dynamic and static features, respectively, to comprehensively capture customer characteristics for buying behaviors. Our model with deep learning architectures combines these features for conversion prediction. We validate the proposed model using real-world e-commerce data.

Enhancing the Performance of Solar Radiation Decomposition Models Using Deep Learning,2023,"['Direct normal irradiance', 'Decomposition model', 'Deep learning', 'Temporal resolutions', '법선면 직달 일사량', '직산분리 모델', '딥러닝', '시간 분해능']",,"Decomposed solar radiation models are commonly used to separate direct and diffuse irradiance from global irradiance. However, most of these models are designed to process hourly data, which may not be sufficient to capture the rapid changes in solar irradiance that occur within a shorter timescale. To address this issue, we examined the performance of existing decomposition models at different temporal resolutions ranging from 1 min to 1 h. We found that the errors in the decomposition models increased as the temporal resolution decreased. Specifically, as the timescale was reduced from hourly to every minute, the relative root-mean-square error(rRMSE) increased by more than 5%. These findings highlight the need to develop accurate models that can process sub-hourly data. Accordingly, we propose the use of deep learning models to estimate the direct irradiance using sub-hourly data. The proposed models significantly reduced the rRMSE by more than 7% compared to the existing models on a 1-min time scale. The results indicate that deep-learning models can provide accurate estimates of direct irradiance, even at sub-hourly temporal resolutions."
Detecting Structural Deterioration: Investigating Changes in Power Spectral Density Using Deep Learning on Damaged Steel Beam Structures,2023,"['Detecting structural deterioration', 'Power spectral density', 'Deep learning', 'Damaged steel beam structures', 'Cracks', 'Vibration signals', 'Acceleration sensors', 'Beam damage', 'PSD shape', 'Fundamental beam frequency']",,"The article focuses on detecting structural deterioration in damaged steel beam structures by investigating changes in power spectral density (PSD) using deep learning. To simulate damage, cracks are introduced to alter the stiffness of the steel beams. The study aims to replicate a realistic traffic scenario over bridges by measuring vibration signals obtained from acceleration sensors distributed along the steel beams. The article proposes a new parameter that tracks the deterioration of structures by analyzing the PSD when a moving load is applied to the steel beams with defects. Features generated from modified forms of the PSD are used to identify structural deterioration via steel beam damage and deep learning in a training dataset. The study found that differences in PSD shape caused by damage are more effective in detecting damage in various beam structures than those in the value of the fundamental beam frequency. Although the PSD method has been utilized in earlier research to identify steel beam defects, the use of deep learning in this study offers numerous novel and advantageous benefits."

It has a fan-filter unit combining a centrifugal fan and a high-efficiency particulate air filter that purifies the outside air and directly affects its cleanliness. Defects in these systems are typically detected using special sensors for each fault, which can be costly. Therefore, this paper proposes a system for diagnosing defects in the fan-filter unit using a single differential sensor and deep learning. The fan-filter unit is part of the air-conditioning system, and it is usually defective in bearings, filters, and motors. These faults include ball wear, internal bearing contamination, filter contamination, and motor speed changes.

The results of deep learning experiments generated by randomly mixing data five times were presented using a confusion matrix, and the results showed an accuracy of 87.2±2.60%. Therefore, the possibility of diagnosing defects in the fan-filter unit using a single sensor was confirmed."

This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of computed tomography (CT) analysis using deep learning algorithms in patients with CHB.Methods: This retrospective study included 2,169 patients with CHB without hepatic decompensation who underwent contrast-enhanced abdominal CT for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance between January 2005 and June 2016. Liver and spleen volumes and body composition measurements including subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and skeletal muscle indices were acquired from CT images using deep learning-based fully automated organ segmentation algorithms. We assessed the significant predictors of HCC, hepatic decompensation, diabetes mellitus (DM), and overall survival (OS) using Cox proportional hazard analyses.Results: During a median follow-up period of 103.0 months, HCC (n=134, 6.2%), hepatic decompensation (n=103, 4.7%), DM (n=432, 19.9%), and death (n=120, 5.5%) occurred. According to the multivariate analysis, standardized spleen volume significantly predicted HCC development (hazard ratio [HR]=1.01, P=0.025), along with age, sex, albumin and platelet count. Standardized spleen volume (HR=1.01, P<0.001) and VAT index (HR=0.98, P=0.004) were significantly associated with hepatic decompensation along with age and albumin. Furthermore, VAT index (HR=1.01, P=0.001) and standardized spleen volume (HR=1.01, P=0.001) were significant predictors for DM, along with sex, age, and albumin. SAT index (HR=0.99, P=0.004) was significantly associated with OS, along with age, albumin, and MELD.Conclusions: Deep learning-based automatically measured spleen volume, VAT, and SAT indices may provide various prognostic information in patients with CHB."
Automated topology design to improve the susceptibility of naval ships using geometric deep learning,2023,"['survivability', 'susceptibility', 'topology design', 'radar cross-section', 'stealth technology', 'geometric deep learning', 'convolutional neural network']",,"The survivability of a naval ship is defined as its ability to evade or withstand a hostile environment while performing a given mission. Stealth technology, which reduces the probability of detection by enemy detection equipment using a highly advanced detection system, is one of the most important technologies to improve the survivability of naval ships. Moreover, radar cross-section (RCS) reduction is a very important factor in stealth technology because a small RCS, which is the main parameter determining susceptibility, improves the ability of ships to evade enemy detection equipment. In this study, an automated topology design for reducing susceptibility was developed by combining geometric deep learning and topology optimization. A convolutional neural network model was used as the geometric deep-learning model, and the triangular meshes of the naval ship models and equipment models were used as datasets. To compensate for the lack of training data, randomly generated meshes were additionally used as datasets. To express the feature data of the mesh as a matrix, points at equal intervals were projected orthogonally and the distance between the plane and point was set as a matrix value. The label data were defined as the highest RCS values excluding the cardinal points. After realizing the topology design for reducing susceptibility using the developed system, verification was performed through RCS analysis of the original model and the topology-designed model."

Age-related changes in toe strength and force steadiness may increase fall risk. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of a fall risk prediction model using toe strength and force steadiness data as input variables. Participants were four healthy adults (25.5±1.7 yrs). To indirectly reproduce physical conditions of older adults, an experiment was conducted by adding conditions for weight and fatigue increase. The maximal strength (MVIC) was measured for 5 s using a custom toe dynamometer. For force steadiness, toe flexion was measured for 10 s according to the target line, which was 40% of the MVIC. A one-leg-standing test was performed for 10 s with eyes-opened using a force plate. Deep learning experiments were performed with seven conditions using long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms. Results of the deep learning model were randomly mixed and expressed through a confusion matrix. Results showed potential of the model's fall risk prediction with force steadiness data as input variables. However, experiments were conducted on young adults.

Seismic event and phase detection using deep learning for the 2016 Gyeongju earthquake sequence,2023,"['earthquake detection', 'deep learning', 'artificial intelligence', 'Gyeongju earthquake', 'phase picking']",,"Deep learning (DL) methods have a high potential for earthquake detection applications because of their high efficiency at processing measurement data, such as picking seismic phases. However, the performance of DL methods must be evaluated to ensure that they can replace conventional methods so that full automation can be achieved. State-of-art DL methods incorporate advanced techniques and train with large global datasets to enhance their earthquake detection capabilities. In this study, we tested a representative DL model on the 2016 Gyeongju earthquake sequence in the Korean Peninsula and compared the results with a previously established catalog and with the results of the conventional Short Time Average/Long Time Average (STA/LTA) method. The DL model demonstrated reasonable improvements in efficiency and performance by detecting more and smaller earthquakes within a much shorter runningtime than the other methods. In addition, the DL algorithms generally provided precise pickings of P- and S-wave phases. The DL model showed good generalization because it appropriately detected earthquakes in the study area that were not included in the training dataset. However, our results did suggest possible errors that should be accounted for, such as inconsistent phase picking, missing large earthquakes, and detecting non-natural earthquake signals. From the result of tests, local optimization may be important for realizing fully automatic earthquake monitoring, such as retraining with a local dataset, fine-tuning, or transfer learning. In addition, incorporating post-processing techniques such as phase association and discrimination into the DL framework is necessary."

Because of the difficulty in processingvolume data, it is difficult to train a DL model as an end-to-end approach using PET volume as an input for variouspurposes including diagnostic classification. We suggest an approach employing two maximum intensity projection (MIP)images generated by whole-body FDG PET volume to employ pre-trained models based on 2-D images.Methods As a retrospective, proof-of-concept study, 562 [18F]FDG PET/CT images and clinicopathological factors oflung cancer patients were collected. MIP images of anterior and lateral views were used as inputs, and image features wereextracted by a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model, ResNet-50. The relationship between the imageswas depicted on a parametric 2-D axes map using t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding (t-SNE), with clinicopathologicalfactors.Results A DL-based feature map extracted by two MIP images was embedded by t-SNE. According to the visualizationof the t-SNE map, PET images were clustered by clinicopathological features. The representative difference between theclusters of PET patterns according to the posture of a patient was visually identified. This map showed a pattern of clusteringaccording to various clinicopathological factors including sex as well as tumor staging.Conclusion A 2-D image-based pre-trained model could extract image patterns of whole-body FDG PET volume by usinganterior and lateral views of MIP images bypassing the direct use of 3-D PET volume that requires large datasets andresources.

Deep learning-based framework for monitoring wearing personal protective equipment on construction sites,2023,"['construction safety', 'computer vision', 'deep learning', 'personal protective equipment']",,"The construction site is one of the most dangerous industries because the number of occupational injuries and fatalities is significantly higher compared to other industries. Proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by workers can reduce the risk of occupational injuries and fatalities. However, for a variety of reasons, workers tend not to wear their PPEs properly. To address these issues, we propose a vision-based framework for monitoring wearing PPE. The developed framework is based on the real-time pixel-level detect model YOLACT, which employs MobileNetV3 as a backbone to lightweight the proposed framework. In addition, the framework uses DeepSORT of object tracking algorithm to interpolate frames not predicted by the model. The post-processing algorithm in our framework classifies the correlation between workers and PPE into four statuses based on the results predicted by YOLACT and the interpolated results from DeepSORT. The results showed that the fine-tuned model achieved 66.4 mean average precision50, and the algorithm successfully determined workers’ PPE-wearing status detection with 91.3% accuracy. This study shows the potential to prevent occupational injuries and reduce social costs by automating monitoring at construction sites in real-time."
Effects of Expert-Determined Reference Standards in Evaluating the Diagnostic Performance of a Deep Learning Model: A Malignant Lung Nodule Detection Task on Chest Radiographs,2023,"['Deep-learning', 'Reference standard', 'Expert-determined standard', 'Decision-support tool', 'Chest radiographs']",,"Objective: Little is known about the effects of using different expert-determined reference standards when evaluating the performance of deep learning-based automatic detection (DLAD) models and their added value to radiologists. We assessed the concordance of expert-determined standards with a clinical gold standard (herein, pathological confirmation) and the effects of different expert-determined reference standards on the estimates of radiologists’ diagnostic performance to detect malignant pulmonary nodules on chest radiographs with and without the assistance of a DLAD model.Materials and Methods: This study included chest radiographs from 50 patients with pathologically proven lung cancer and 50 controls. Five expert-determined standards were constructed using the interpretations of 10 experts: individual judgment by the most experienced expert, majority vote, consensus judgments of two and three experts, and a latent class analysis (LCA) model. In separate reader tests, additional 10 radiologists independently interpreted the radiographs and then assisted with the DLAD model. Their diagnostic performance was estimated using the clinical gold standard and various expertdetermined standards as the reference standard, and the results were compared using the t test with Bonferroni correction.Results: The LCA model (sensitivity, 72.6%; specificity, 100%) was most similar to the clinical gold standard. When expertdetermined standards were used, the sensitivities of radiologists and DLAD model alone were overestimated, and their specificities were underestimated (all p-values < 0.05). DLAD assistance diminished the overestimation of sensitivity but exaggerated the underestimation of specificity (all p-values < 0.001). The DLAD model improved sensitivity and specificity to a greater extent when using the clinical gold standard than when using the expert-determined standards (all p-values < 0.001), except for sensitivity with the LCA model (p = 0.094).Conclusion: The LCA model was most similar to the clinical gold standard for malignant pulmonary nodule detection on chest radiographs. Expert-determined standards caused bias in measuring the diagnostic performance of the artificial intelligence model."
Deep learning-assisted active noise control in a time-varying environment,2023,['· Active noise control · Deep neural network · Filtered-x least mean square algorithm · Secondary path'],,"The success of active noise control (ANC) is largely determined by the fidelity of the estimated secondary path, which encapsulates the ""room acoustics"" between the secondary sound source and the error sensor. In a time-invariant system the secondary path is usually measured and hard-coded in the controller prior to the ANC operation. When ANC is to be performed in a time-varying environment, however, the estimated secondary path should be updated accordingly, a task that poses many challenges in terms of efficacy, cost, and user comfort. In this paper we present a deep learning-assisted secondary path update technique, in which deep neural networks are trained to estimate the secondary path in real time according to changing boundary conditions. The feasibility of the technique is tested in an airborne duct, where the error sensor is allowed to move along the duct to simulate changes in boundary conditions. Results have shown that even in the face of a dramatic change in boundary conditions, the ANC system equipped with the present update scheme is capable of reducing broadband noise by up to 10 dB."

The study proposes a deep learning-based detection framework compatible with drones for monitoring vegetation encroachment near powerlines which estimates vegetation health and detects powerlines. Aerial image pairs from a drone camera and a commercial-grade multispectral sensor were captured and processed into training and validation datasets which were used to train a Generative Adversarial Network (Pix2Pix model) and a Convolutional Neural Network (YoLov5 model).

Robust deep learning-based fault detection of planetary gearbox using enhanced health data map under domain shift problem,2023,"['fault detection', 'planetary gearbox', 'domain-shift', 'convolution autoencoder', 'Sobel operator', 'EnHDMap']",,"The conventional deep learning-based fault diagnosis approach faces challenges under the domain shift problem, where the model encounters different working conditions from the ones it was trained on. This challenge is particularly pronounced in the diagnosis of planetary gearboxes due to the complicated vibrations they generate, which can vary significantly based on the system characteristics of the gearbox. To solve this challenge, this paper proposes a robust deep learning-based fault-detection approach for planetary gearboxes by utilizing an enhanced health data map (HDMap). Although there is an HDMap method that visually expresses the vibration signal of the planetary gearbox according to the gear meshing position, it is greatly influenced by machine operating conditions. In this study, domain-specific features from the HDMap are further removed, while the fault-related features are enhanced. Autoencoder-based residual analysis and digital image-processing techniques are employed to address the domain-shift problem. The performance of the proposed method was validated under significant domain-shift problem conditions, as demonstrated by studying two gearbox test rigs with different configurations operated under stationary and non-stationary operating conditions. Validation accuracy was measured in all 12 possible domain-shift scenarios. The proposed method achieved robust fault detection accuracy, outperforming prior methods in most cases."

Thus, personalized recommendation services are required to select a restaurant suitable for consumer preferences. Previous studies have used questionnaires and star-rating approaches, which do not effectively depict consumer preferences. Online reviews are the most essential sources of information in this regard. However, previous studies have aggregated online reviews into long documents, and traditional machine-learning methods have been applied to these to extract semantic representations; however, such approaches fail to consider the surrounding word or context. Therefore, this study proposes a novel review textual-based restaurant recommendation model (RT-RRM) that uses deep learning to effectively extract consumer preferences from online reviews. The proposed model concatenates consumer-restaurant interactions with the extracted high-level semantic representations and predicts consumer preferences accurately and effectively. Experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed model exhibits excellent recommendation performance compared with several baseline models."

Multi-Class Classification Prediction Model for Password Strength Based on Deep Learning,2023,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Deep Learning', 'Password Strength', 'Password Strength Prediction.']",,"Various indexes are being used today to evaluate the strength of passwords. In these indexes, the strength of a password is evaluated to be high if it takes longer for an attacker to predict it. Therefore, using such an evaluation, there is a problem that a leaked password may reduce the reliability of the index by increasing vulnerability if an attacker attempts to attack using a leaked password. Hence, estimating the leaked frequency when considering strength is important for reducing vulnerability. This paper proposes a password strength evaluation model using deep learning-based multi-class classification, which solves the existing problem of leaked frequency not being considered during evaluation. Data preprocessing modeling is critical to improve the performance of this model. Additionally, since selecting and extracting feature values of preprocessing data is also important, a model that accurately estimates the degree of leakage through an evaluation method of existing indexes is proposed. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, an experiment that compares the password leaked frequency stored in a data-base using a password list was conducted. As a result, the proposed model correctly evaluated 99% of the 345 leaked passwords. Therefore, the effectiveness of the proposed model was verified."

A Study on Fire Detection Using Deep Learning and Image Filtering Based on Characteristics of Flame and Smoke,2023,"['Fire safety system', 'Computer vision', 'Image processing', 'Deep learning']",,"When a fire breaks out, damage to human health is more often caused by poisoning and suffocation related to the occurrence of smoke than by a direct cause such as exposure to flame. In addition, fire that is in the condition of smoldering has fatal potential for the human body because it shows a high rate of production of carbon monoxide rather than carbon dioxide due to an incomplete combustion process. Therefore, this study sought to achieve early image-based detection not only of flames but also of smoke in the event of a fire. To this end, a flame area was pre-processed using color and corner detection, while smoke could be detected using dark channel prior characteristics and optical flow. For the pre-processed region of interest, a deep learning-based convolutional neural network was used to infer whether the region was a fire. Through this approach, it was possible to improve accuracy by lowering the error detection rate compared to when a fire was detected through an object detection model without separate pre-processing. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, inference was conducted through a directly photographed image. As a result, the an accuracy level of 97.0% in the case of flames and 94.0% in the case of smoke could be confirmed."
Timely and Covert Communications under Deep Learning-Based Eavesdropping and Jamming Effects,2023,"['Age of Information', 'timeliness', 'jamming', 'eavesdropping', 'covert communications', 'status updates']",,"This paper explores the concept of timeliness in covert communications when faced with eavesdropping and jamming. Time-sensitive information is to be transmitted through a wireless channel between a transmitter and a receiver, while an adversary seeks to detect the communication attempts with a deep learning-based classifier (using feedforward or convolutional neural networks). The adversary jams any detected transmission, subject to an average power budget. When the transmit power is set at a high level, the outage probability decreases, resulting in more reliable communication. However, this also increases the accuracy of the adversary's detection, making it more likely for the jammer to successfully identify and jam the communication. On the other hand, using a low transmit power leads to a higher outage probability for communication and decreases the accuracy of the adversary in detecting and disrupting a transmission.The trade-off between reliability, timeliness, and stealthiness in wireless communications is analyzed in this paper by characterizing the Age of Information and its behavior under the influence of eavesdropping and jamming effects. Results indicate novel operation modes for timely and covert communications under eavesdropping and jamming effects."

Related research is being actively conducted, including many studies on the maintenance and predictive maintenance of propulsion systems (including electric motors and rotating bodies) in electric propulsion vessels. The present study intends to enhance the artificial intelligence (AI)-based failure-diagnosis rate for electric propulsion vessel propulsion systems. To verify the proposed AI-based failure diagnosis algorithm for electric motors, this study utilized the vibration data of mechanical equipment (electric motors) in an urban railway station. Securing and preprocessing high-quality data is crucial for improving the failure-diagnosis rate, in addition to the performance of the diagnostic algorithm. However, the conventional wavelet transform method, which is generally used for machine signal processing, has a disadvantage of data loss when the data distribution is abnormal or skewed. This study, to overcome this shortcoming, proposes an AI-based denoising auto encoder (DAE) method that can remove noise while maintaining data characteristics for signal processing of mechanical equipment. This study preprocessed vibration data by using the DAE method, and extracted significant features from the data through the feature extraction method. The extracted features were utilized to train the one-class support vector machine model and to allow the model to diagnose the failure. Finally, the F-1 score was calculated by using the failure diagnosis results, and the most meaningful feature extraction method was determined for the vibration data. In addition, this study compared and evaluated the preprocessing performance based on the DAE and the wavelet transform methods."

Stress Level Based Emotion Classification Using Hybrid Deep Learning Algorithm,2023,"['Stress analysis', 'Emotion analysis', 'Deep learning', 'Classification', 'Convolutional neural network']",,"The present fast-moving era brings a serious stress issue that affects elders and youngsters. Everyone has undergone stress factors at least once in their lifetime. Stress is more among youngsters as they are new to the working environment. whereas the stress factors for elders affect the individual and overall performance in an organization. Electroencephalogram (EEG) based stress level classification is one of the widely used methodologies for stress detection. However, the signal processing methods evolved so far have limitations as most of the stress classification models compute the stress level in a predefined environment to detect individual stress factors. Specifically, machine learning based stress classification models requires additional algorithm for feature extraction which increases the computation cost. Also due to the limited feature learning characteristics of machine learning algorithms, the classification performance reduces and inaccurate sometimes. It is evident from numerous research works that deep learning models outperforms machine learning techniques. Thus, to classify all the emotions based on stress level in this research work a hybrid deep learning algorithm is presented. Compared to conventional deep learning models, hybrid models outperforms in feature handing. Better feature extraction and selection can be made through deep learning models. Adding machine learning classifiers in deep learning architecture will enhance the classification performances. Thus, a hybrid convolutional neural network model was presented which extracts the features using CNN and classifies them through machine learning support vector machine.

A comparative study on the implementation of deep learning algorithms for detection of hepatic necrosis in toxicity studies,2023,['Deep learning · Hepatic necrosis · Histopathology · Image analysis · Toxicology'],,"Deep learning has recently become one of the most popular methods of image analysis. In non-clinical studies, several tissue slides are generated to investigate the toxicity of a test compound. These are converted into digital image data using a slide scanner, which is then studied by researchers to investigate abnormalities, and the deep learning method has been started to adopt in this study. However, comparative studies evaluating different deep learning algorithms for analyzing abnormal lesions are scarce. In this study, we applied three algorithms, SSD, Mask R-CNN, and DeepLabV3+, to detect hepatic necrosis in slide images and determine the best deep learning algorithm for analyzing abnormal lesions. We trained each algorithm on 5750 images and 5835 annotations of hepatic necrosis including validation and test, augmented with 500 image tiles of 448 × 448 pixels. Precision, recall, and accuracy were calculated for each algorithm based on the prediction results of 60 test images of 2688 × 2688 pixels. The two segmentation algorithms, DeepLabV3+ and Mask R-CNN, showed over 90% of accuracy (0.94 and 0.92, respectively), whereas SSD, an object detection algorithm, showed lower accuracy. The trained DeepLabV3+ outperformed all others in recall while also successfully separating hepatic necrosis from other features in the test images. It is important to localize and separate the abnormal lesion of interest from other features to investigate it on a slide level. Therefore, we suggest that segmentation algorithms are more appropriate than object detection algorithms for use in the pathological analysis of images in non-clinical studies."

Deep learning prediction of non-perfused volume without contrast agents during prostate ablation therapy,2023,"['High intensity focused ultrasound', 'Deep learning', 'Contrast-enhanced MRI', 'UNet model', 'Clinical trialsthermal ablation', 'Control systems engineering', 'Treatment optimization']",,"The non-perfused volume (NPV) is an important indicator of treatment success immediately after prostate ablation. However, visualization of the NPV first requires an injection of MRI contrast agents into the bloodstream, which has many downsides. Purpose of this study was to develop a deep learning model capable of predicting the NPV immediately after prostate ablation therapy without the need for MRI contrast agents. A modified 2D deep learning UNet model was developed to predict the post-treatment NPV. MRI imaging data from 95 patients who had previously undergone prostate ablation therapy for treatment of localized prostate cancer were used to train, validate, and test the model. Model inputs were T1/T2-weighted and thermometry MRI images, which were always acquired without any MRI contrast agents and prior to the final NPV image on treatment-day. Model output was the predicted NPV. Model accuracy was assessed using the Dice-Similarity Coefficient (DSC) by comparing the predicted to ground truth NPV. A radiologist also performed a qualitative assessment of NPV. Mean (std) DSC score for predicted NPV was 85% ± 8.1% compared to ground truth. Model performance was significantly better for slices with larger prostate radii (> 24 mm) and for whole-gland rather than partial ablation slices. The predicted NPV was indistinguishable from ground truth for 31% of images. Feasibility of predicting NPV using a UNet model without MRI contrast agents was clearly established. If developed further, this could improve patient treatment outcomes and could obviate the need for contrast agents altogether.Trial Registration Numbers Three studies were used to populate the data: NCT02766543, NCT03814252 and NCT03350529."

PubMed and Embase databases were used in the initial search. The identified items were screened based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Information regarding model development, quality of validation, and model performance was extracted from the included studies. The current review found 55 studies that passed the criteria. In terms of target animals, the number of studies on industrial animals was similar to that on com- panion animals. Quantitative scarcity of prediction studies (n = 11, including duplications) was revealed in both industrial and non-industrial animal studies compared to diagnostic studies (n = 45, including duplications). Qualitative lim- itations were also identified, especially regarding validation methodologies. Con- sidering these gaps in the literature, future studies examining the prediction and validation processes, which employ a prospective and multi-center approach, are highly recommended. Veterinary practitioners should acknowledge the current limitations in this field and adopt a receptive and critical attitude towards these new technologies to avoid their abuse."
Ensemble-based Deep Learning Approach for Performance Improvement of BIM Element Classification,2023,"['BIM', 'Semantic integrity', 'Deep learning', 'Ensemble learning', 'Semantic relations']",,"Ensemble learning is explored as an approach to improve the classification of BIM elements using multiple deep learning classifiers. Existing studies have focused on improving the performance of a single classifier, thereby restricting the types of features available for training. Two classifiers, MVCNN and MLP, were trained on nine BIM element classes extracted from a 20-story office building. MVCNN used multiple images of these elements, while MLP used adjacency relations between elements. The predictions of the classifiers were then ensembled using a maximum rule-based algebraic combiner. Results showed that the overall classification accuracy improved by +0.05. The Ensemble model, in effect, leveraged the strength of each classifier: MVCNN for elements with distinct features and MLPs for elements with high similarity. The Ensemble model enables the automatic checking of the semantic accuracy of elements in BIM models, thus endorsing the seamless information exchanges required for true interoperability in BIM-centric project collaboration."
A Framework for Improving Object Recognition of Structural Components in Construction Site Photos Using Deep Learning Approaches,2023,"['Object detection', 'Deep learning', 'BIM', 'Photo image', 'Schedule management']",,"Mobile phones and drones are widely used to record images of construction sites in various stages of progress. Although site images can be used a lot during the construction period, they are mostly used only for recording simple construction results. If objects in a photographic image are recognized by a component of construction structure, the image could serve as a valuable tool in construction schedule management. In this study, authors present a framework for automatically recognizing objects for each component of a structure in a photographic image. To this end, after collecting and training a large amount of photographic images from the railroad bridge structures, an object detection method that can automatically recognize the construction components of the bridge structure based on deep learning model was introduced. Images are procured through web crawling, and the collected images are pre-treated for supervised training. The results of the deep learning model showed high performance in the pier and coping classes, and the slab showed a rather low accuracy, and it was confirmed that the degree of utilization of the detection results was significantly affected by the angle of shooting the image."
Text Classification on Social Network Platforms Based on Deep Learning Models,2023,"['Big data', 'Deep learning model', 'Neural network', 'Social network platform', 'Text classification']",,"The natural language on social network platforms has a certain front-to-back dependency in structure, and the direct conversion of Chinese text into a vector makes the dimensionality very high, thereby resulting in the low accuracy of existing text classification methods. To this end, this study establishes a deep learning model that combines a big data ultra-deep convolutional neural network (UDCNN) and long short-term memory network (LSTM). The deep structure of UDCNN is used to extract the features of text vector classification. The LSTM stores historical information to extract the context dependency of long texts, and word embedding is introduced to convert the text into low-dimensional vectors. Experiments are conducted on the social network platforms Sogou corpus and the University HowNet Chinese corpus. The research results show that compared with CNN + rand, LSTM, and other models, the neural network deep learning hybrid model can effectively improve the accuracy of text classification."
Application of Deep Learning in Motor Vibration and Noise Suppression Based on Negative Magnetostrictive Effect,2023,"['Vibration and noise', 'Magnetostrictive effect', 'Electromagnetic–mechanical coupling', 'FEA', 'Deep learning']",,"The suppression of vibration and noise is one of the critical problems in the optimal design of the motor. The vibration and noise caused by the magnetostrictive effect can not be ignored. In this paper, the vibration and noise caused by the magnetostrictive effect are suppressed by drilling holes in the stator and filling the holes with negative magnetostrictive material. Firstly, the electromagnetic–mechanical coupling model is established. By traversing all the drilling positions by finite element analysis (FEA), the stress value is calculated, and the drilling position corresponding to the minimum local stress is determined. It is found that the resource consumed by FEA is expensive, and the calculation time is prolonged. Deep learning is introduced as an alternative model to calculate the hole’s position and size. The Pix2Pix, Pix2PixHD, CycleGAN, and StarGAN are experimented with based on the PyTorch environment. Through the experiment, it is found that deep learning has an absolute advantage over the FEA in time which ensures a high accuracy rate. Finally, an experimental platform for measuring the strain of the motor stator is designed. According to the best positions and apertures of holes are obtained by the simulation and the actual situation, we drill holes in the motor stator and fill the holes with Ni, a negative magnetostrictive material. The result shows that the stator’s local stress is reduced by about 16%. The vibration and noise caused by the magnetostrictive effect are suppressed effectively."

Inland harmful algal blooms (HABs) modeling using internet of things (IoT) system and deep learning,2023,"['Attention mechanism', 'Deep learning', 'Harmful algal blooms (HABs)', 'Internet of things (IoT)', 'Water quality']",,"Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have been frequently occurred with releasing toxic substances, which typically lead to water quality degradation and health problems for humans and aquatic animals. Hence, accurate quantitative analysis and prediction of HABs should be implemented to detect, monitor, and manage severe algal blooms. However, the traditional monitoring required sufficient expense and labor while numerical models were restricted in terms of their ability to simulate the algae dynamic. To address the challenging issue, this study evaluates the applicability of deep learning to simulate chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and phycocyanin (PC) with the internet of things (IoT) system. Our research adopted LSTM models for simulating Chl-a and PC. Among LSTM models, the attention LSTM model achieved superior performance by showing 0.84 and 2.35 (μg/L) of the correlation coefficient and root mean square error. Among preprocessing methods, the z-score method was selected as the optimal method to improve model performance. The attention mechanism highlighted the input data from July to October, indicating that this period was the most influential period to model output. Therefore, this study demonstrated that deep learning with IoT system has the potential to detect and quantify cyanobacteria, which can improve the eutrophication management schemes for freshwater reservoirs."
How Long Will Your Videos Remain Popular? Empirical Study with Deep Learning and Survival Analysis,2023,"['Online Video', 'YouTube', 'Deep Learning', 'Survival Analysis', 'Video Popularity']",,"One of the emerging trends in the marketing field is digital video marketing. Online videos offer rich content typically containing more information than any other type of content (e.g., audible or textual content). Accordingly, previous researchers have examined factors influencing videos’ popularity. However, few studies have examined what causes a video to remain popular. Some videos achieve continuous, ongoing popularity, while others fade out quickly. For practitioners, videos at the recommendation slots may serve as strong communication channels, as many potential consumers are exposed to such videos. So,this study will provide practitioners important advice regarding how to choose videos that will survive as long-lasting favorites, allowing them to advertise in a cost-effective manner. Using deep learning techniques, this study extracts text from videos and measured the videos’ tones, including factual and emotional tones. Additionally, we measure the aesthetic score by analyzing the thumbnail images in the data. We then empirically show that the cognitive features of a video, such as the tone of a message and the aesthetic assessment of a thumbnail image, play an important role in determining videos’ long-term popularity. We believe that this is the first study of its kind to examine new factors that aid in ensuring a video remains popular using both deep learning and econometric methodologies."

An Analysis of Plant Diseases Identification Based on Deep Learning Methods,2023,"['convolutional neural networks', 'deep learning', 'plant diseases detection']",,"Plant disease is an important factor affecting crop yield.With various types and complex conditions, plant diseases cause serious economic losses, as well as modern agriculture constraints. Hence, rapid, accurate, and early identification of crop diseases is of great significance.Recent developments in deep learning, especially convolutional neural network (CNN), have shown impressive performance in plant disease classification.However, most of the existing datasets for plant disease classification are a single background environment rather than a real field environment. In addition, the classification can only obtain the category of a single disease and fail to obtain the location of multiple different diseases, which limits the practical application.Therefore, the object detection method based on CNN can overcome these shortcomings and has broad application prospects. In this study, an annotated apple leaf disease dataset in a real field environment was first constructed to compensate for the lack of existing datasets. Moreover, the Faster R-CNN and YOLOv3 architectures were trained to detect apple leaf diseases in our dataset. Finally, comparative experiments were conducted and a variety of evaluation indicators were analyzed.

"High-resolution imaging coupled with deep learning model for classifying water body of Soyang Lake, South Korea",2023,"['classification', 'KOMPSAT', 'PlanetScope', 'Soyang Lake', 'U-Net']",,"Precise monitoring of natural phenomena is essential to reduce potential risk when a disaster occurs. The capability of developing high-resolution satellite images has provided advantages in the Earth’s surface observation. High-resolution images, including KOMPSAT-2/3 and PlanetScope images, have enabled more precise observation of the Earth’s surface. Combining the high-resolution KOMPSAT-2/3 and PlanetScope images and a capable image classifier tool can contribute to improving the confidence level of the observation. Recently, deep learning models provided enhanced capability compared to traditional machine learning, especially in image classification. In this study, we aim to investigate performance comparison between deep learning model using U-Net architecture and traditional machine learning represented by support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) model with a focus on identifying water bodies on a lake. Significant differences in surface area of water of Soyang Lake occurred in 2015 and 2022 was the area of interest of this study. Based on confusion matrix analysis, the best classification results were indicated by deep learning model represented by U-Net with overall accuracy  ranging from 97% to 100% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.91–1.00. The two traditional machine learning models, SVM and RF, lower up to 11% in overall accuracy and 0.15 for Kappa coefficient values. We also estimated the surface area of water based on the best classification results and found that the changes in water surface area were correlated with the monthly precipitation with a coefficient correlation of 0.89.

Biometric identification of Black Bengal goat: unique iris pattern matching system vs deep learning approach,2023,"['Biometric Identification', 'Black Bengal Goat', 'Deep Learning', 'Goat Identification', 'Iris Image', 'Iris Pattern Matching']",,"Objective: Iris pattern recognition system is well developed and practiced in human, however, there is a scarcity of information on application of iris recognition system in animals at the field conditions where the major challenge is to capture a high-quality iris image from a constantly moving non-cooperative animal even when restrained properly. The aim of the study was to validate and identify Black Bengal goat biometrically to improve animal management in its traceability system.Methods: Forty-nine healthy, disease free, 3 months±6 days old female Black Bengal goats were randomly selected at the farmer’s field. Eye images were captured from the left eye of an individual goat at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age using a specialized camera made for human iris scanning. iGoat software was used for matching the same individual goats at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of ages. Resnet152V2 deep learning algorithm was further applied on same image sets to predict matching percentages using only captured eye images without extracting their iris features.Results: The matching threshold computed within and between goats was 55%. The accuracies of template matching of goats at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of ages were recorded as 81.63%, 90.24%, 44.44%, and 16.66%, respectively. As the accuracies of matching the goats at 9 and 12 months of ages were low and below the minimum threshold matching percentage, this process of iris pattern matching was not acceptable. The validation accuracies of resnet152V2 deep learning model were found 82.49%, 92.68%, 77.17%, and 87.76% for identification of goat at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of ages, respectively after training the model.Conclusion: This study strongly supported that deep learning method using eye images could be used as a signature for biometric identification of an individual goat."
Research on data augmentation algorithm for time series based on deep learning,2023,"['Data Augmentation', 'Time Series', 'GAN', 'Deep Learning', 'Neural Network']",,"Data monitoring is an important foundation of modern science. In most cases, the monitoring data is time-series data, which has high application value. The deep learning algorithm has a strong nonlinear fitting capability, which enables the recognition of time series by capturing anomalous information in time series. At present, the research of time series recognition based on deep learning is especially important for data monitoring. Deep learning algorithms require a large amount of data for training. However, abnormal sample is a small sample in time series, which means the number of abnormal time series can seriously affect the accuracy of recognition algorithm because of class imbalance. In order to increase the number of abnormal sample, a data augmentation method called GANBATS (GAN-based Bi-LSTM and Attention for Time Series) is proposed. In GANBATS, Bi-LSTM is introduced to extract the timing features and then transfer features to the generator network of GANBATS.GANBATS also modifies the discriminator network by adding an attention mechanism to achieve global attention for time series. At the end of discriminator, GANBATS is adding averagepooling layer, which merges temporal features to boost the operational efficiency. In this paper, four time series datasets and five data augmentation algorithms are used for comparison experiments. The generated data are measured by PRD(Percent Root Mean Square Difference) and DTW(Dynamic Time Warping). The experimental results show that GANBATS reduces up to 26.22 in PRD metric and 9.45 in DTW metric. In addition, this paper uses different algorithms to reconstruct the datasets and compare them by classification accuracy. The classification accuracy is improved by 6.44%-12.96% on four time series datasets."

The conventional PID control has 1.988 °C/sec errors between the target temperature and the actual temperature in the designated temperature profile. The average error value of the model is lower (1.766 °C/sec errors) due to the predictive model and optimization. The accuracy of MPC is 12.4% higher than that of the PID model. Neural network based deep learning control model is clearly more accurate the PID model. When LSTM model was trained with optimal parameters, The average error between the target temperature and the actual temperature of LSTM model is 1.752 °C/sec.

Kidney organoids derived from hPSCs have the potential to be applied in regenerative medicineas well as renal disease modeling, drug screening, and nephrotoxicity testing. Despite biotechnological advances, individual differencesin morphological and growth characteristics among kidney organoids need to be addressed before clinical and commercial application. Inthis study, we hypothesized that an automated noninvasive method based on deep learning of bright-field images of kidney organoids canpredict their differentiation status.Methods: Bright-field images of kidney organoids were collected on day 18 after differentiation. To train convolutional neural networks(CNNs), we utilized a transfer learning approach. CNNs were trained to predict the differentiation of kidney organoids on bright-field imagesbased on the messenger RNA expression of renal tubular epithelial cells as well as podocytes.Results: The best prediction model was DenseNet121 with a total Pearson correlation coefficient score of 0.783 on a test dataset. W classifiedthe kidney organoids into two categories: organoids with above-average gene expression (Positive) and those with below-average geneexpression (Negative). Comparing the best-performing CNN with human-based classifiers, the CNN algorithm had a receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve (AUC) score of 0.85, while the experts had an AUC score of 0.48.Conclusion: These results confirmed our original hypothesis and demonstrated that our artificial intelligence algorithm can successfully recognizethe differentiation status of kidney organoids."
Spam Image Detection Model based on Deep Learning for Improving Spam Filter,2023,"['Classification', 'Deep Learning', 'Image Processing', 'Image SPAM', 'Obfuscated Feature', 'SPAM']",,"Due to the development and dissemination of modern technology, anyone can easily communicate usingservices such as social network service (SNS) through a personal computer (PC) or smartphone. The developmentof these technologies has caused many beneficial effects. At the same time, bad effects also occurred, oneof which was the spam problem. Spam refers to unwanted or rejected information received by unspecifiedusers. The continuous exposure of such information to service users creates inconvenience in the user's use ofthe service, and if filtering is not performed correctly, the quality of service deteriorates. Recently, spammersare creating more malicious spam by distorting the image of spam text so that optical character recognition(OCR)-based spam filters cannot easily detect it. Fortunately, the level of transformation of image spamcirculated on social media is not serious yet. However, in the mail system, spammers (the person who sendsspam) showed various modifications to the spam image for neutralizing OCR, and therefore, the same situationcan happen with spam images on social media. Spammers have been shown to interfere with OCR readingthrough geometric transformations such as image distortion, noise addition, and blurring. Various techniqueshave been studied to filter image spam, but at the same time, methods of interfering with image spamidentification using obfuscated images are also continuously developing. In this paper, we propose a deeplearning-based spam image detection model to improve the existing OCR-based spam image detectionperformance and compensate for vulnerabilities. The proposed model extracts text features and image featuresfrom the image using four sub-models. First, the OCR-based text model extracts the text-related features,whether the image contains spam words, and the word embedding vector from the input image. Then, theconvolution neural network-based image model extracts image obfuscation and image feature vectors from theinput image. The extracted feature is determined whether it is a spam image by the final spam image classifier.As a result of evaluating the F1-score of the proposed model, the performance was about 14 points higher thanthe OCR-based spam image detection performance."

Digital healthcare research is being conducted on many conditions including shock. However, the causes of shock are diverse, and the treatment is very complicated, requiring a high level of medical knowledge. In this paper, we propose a shock detection method based on the correlation between shock and data extracted from hemodynamic monitoring equipment. From the various parameters expressed by this equipment, four parameters closely related to patient shock were used as the input data for a machine learning model in order to detect the shock. Using the four parameters as input data, that is, feature values, a random forest-based ensemble machine learning model was constructed. The value of the mean arterial pressure was used as the correct answer value, the so called label value, to detect the patient’s shock state. The performance was then compared with the decision tree and logistic regression model using a confusion matrix. The average accuracy of the random forest model was 92.80%, which shows superior performance compared to other models. We look forward to our work playing a role in helping medical staff by making recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of complex and difficult cases of shock."

Analysis of machine learning and deep learning prediction models for sepsis and neonatal sepsis: A systematic review,2023,['Machine learningDeep learningSepsisSeptic ShockNeonatal Sepsis'],,"Sepsis and Neonatal sepsis are major challenges in global healthcare because they cause life-threatening organ dysfunction in intensive care adult and pediatric patients due to downregulated host response to a particular infection. Early clinical identification of sepsis is difficult, and failure to provide prompt treatment can often lead to crucial stages and increase the rates of fatality. Thus an intense study is needed to determine and categorize sepsis in its initial stage. The complexity of varying clinical statistics makes it difficult to attain a precise definition in pediatrics. The advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) technologies in the implementation of protocols show promising real-time models for predicting sepsis at the primary stage and thereby reducing the mortality rate. This review article contemplates the complete list of procedures through which sepsis and neonatal sepsis are speculated by ML and DL and concentrates specifically on data available in the adult emergency care unit as well as the neonatal intensive care unit. The survey process was carried out by searching terms related to ML and DL merged with topics concerning sepsis and neonatal sepsis. The literature analysis was carried out from Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed databases for the period from 2015 to 2022. The assessment of the risk of bias was carried out for the eleven selected papers using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). The eleven papers were selected from different medical care units based on the performance measure AUROC, which ranges from 0.68 to 0.95. Five papers involving ML/DL models reduce the bias and lessen risk occurrence. Five papers generate an increase in bias but can be applied to new data. One paper works with above twenty-five features has high-risk probability but predicts patients within 5–6 h in the future.

To perform these tasks, a wide variety of Machine Learning Models (MLMs) are proposed by researchers, and each of them varies in terms of their performance-level nuances, functional advantages, contextual limitations, and application-specific future scopes. Upon analyzing these characteristics, it was observed that existing models are highly context-specific, and cannot be applied to multidomain bug analysis datasets. Moreover, existing models do not incorporate a dynamic feature selection method, which limits their accuracy performance under multiple bug classification applications. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes design of a novel Ensemble deep learning Classifier with Feature Selection for high-efficiency Multidomain Bug Prediction under different use cases. The proposed model improves bug representation performance by combining multiple feature extraction methods, including GWO-based novel feature selection techniques. The ensemble classification model, which combines Deep Random Forest, k Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine, and 1D Convolutional Neural Network classifiers, achieves higher accuracy, precision, recall, and low delay compared to existing models. The model also shows faster classification speeds than existing models and can be deployed for various real-time applications. This accuracy performance was compared with various state-of-the-art models, and it was observed that the proposed model showcases 4.5% higher accuracy, 3.2% better precision, 3.9% higher recall, and 5.5% faster classification performance, which was possible due to integration of intelligent feature selection process with high efficiency classification models under multidomain scenarios."

The exact pathogenesis of IC/PBS remains a mystery, but it is postulated to be multifactorial. Theories range from bladder urothelial abnormalities, mast cell degranulation in the bladder, bladder inflammation, to altered bladder innervation. Therapeutic strategies encompass patient education, dietary and lifestyle modifications, medication, intravesical therapy, and surgical intervention. This article delves into the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis prediction of IC/PBS, presenting the latest research findings, artificial intelligence technology applications in diagnosing major diseases in IC/PBS, and emerging treatment alternatives."
A rolling bearing fault evolution state indicator based on deep learning and its application,2023,['· Rolling bearing · Fault evolution · Status indicator · Deep learning · Wavelet analysis'],,"Aiming at the limitation of early fault warning and the diagnosis of aero-engine main bearing when there are only normal operation data, a rolling bearing fault evolution state indicator based on deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and wavelet analysis was proposed. To be specific, firstly, the wavelet band envelope method was adopted to identify the early fault evolution process, and the feature distance between the degraded data and the normal ones was extracted by using deep CNN to develop the evolution state indicator. Then, the evolution stages were divided by using unsupervised clustering method. Finally, the remaining useful life (RUL) was predicted based on particle filter (PF). Three different groups of whole life cycle data of rolling bearings under various working conditions were used to prove the feasibility of the indicator. The results show that the wavelet-CNN features of completely different fault data show similar evolution trends, and the normalization of warning threshold can be realized based on the train labels. In conclusion, the results are of great significance for the early fault evolution monitoring, condition evaluation and remaining useful life prediction of rolling bearings without the absence of fault samples under actual aeroengine operation."

Enhancing Service Availability in Multi-Access Edge Computing with Deep Q-Learning,2023,"['Edge Computing', 'Service Mobility', 'Service Availability', 'Beyond 5G', 'Deep Reinforcement Learning']",,"The Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) paradigm equips network edge telecommunication infrastructure with cloud computing resources. It seeks to transform the edge into an IT services platform for hosting resource-intensive and delay-stringent services for mobile users, thereby significantly enhancing perceived service quality of experience. However, erratic user mobility impedes seamless service continuity as well as satisfying delay-stringent service requirements, especially as users roam farther away from the serving MEC resource, which deteriorates quality of experience. This work proposes a deep reinforcement learning based service mobility management approach for ensuring seamless migration of service instances along user mobility. The proposed approach focuses on the problem of selecting the optimal MEC resource to host services for high mobility users, thereby reducing service migration rejection rate and enhancing service availability. Efficacy of the proposed approach is confirmed through simulation experiments, where results show that on average, the proposed scheme reduces service delay by 8%, task computing time by 36%, and migration rejection rate by more than 90%, when comparing to a baseline scheme."
Forecasting future electric power consumption in Busan New Port using a deep learning model,2023,"['Long-short-term memory model', 'Seaport', 'electrical power consumption', 'Deep learning model', 'Supply and demand', 'Alternative marine power', 'Busan new port']",,"As smart and environmentally friendly technologies and equipment are introduced in the sea port industry, electric power consumption is expected to rapidly increase. However, there is a paucity of research on the creation of electric power management plans, specifically in relation to electric power consumption forecasting, in ports. In order to address this gap, this study forecasts future electric power consumption in Busan New Port (South Korea’s largest container port) and, comparing this with the current standard electric power supply capacity, investigated the feasibility of maintaining a stable electric power supply in the future. We applied a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model trained using electric power consumption and throughput data of the last 10 years to forecast the future electric power consumption of Busan New Port. According to the results, electric power consumption is expected to increase at an annual average of 4.9 % until 2040, exceeding the predicted annual 4.7 % increase in throughput during the same period. Given these results, the current standard electric power supply capacity is forecast to reach only 35 % of demand in 2040, indicating that additional electrical power supply facilities will be needed for stable port operation in the future."
Ventricle tracking in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) images during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) using deep learning and monogenic filtering,2023,"['Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)', 'Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)', 'Ejection fraction (EF)', 'Deep learning (DL)']",,"High-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the most important factor in promoting resuscitation outcomes; therefore,monitoring the quality of CPR is strongly recommended in current CPR guidelines. Recently, transesophageal echocardiography(TEE) has been proposed as a potential real-time feedback modality because physicians can obtain clearechocardiographic images without interfering with CPR. The quality of CPR would be optimized if the myocardial ejectionfraction (EF) could be calculated in real-time during CPR. We conducted a study to derive a protocol to detect systole anddiastole automatically and calculate EF using TEE images acquired from patients with cardiac arrest. The data were supplementedusing thin-plate spline transformation to solve the problem of insufficient data.

Developing a Solution to Improve Road Safety Using Multiple Deep Learning Techniques,2023,"['Meteorological Data', 'Orthophoto Image Data', 'Road Surface Data', 'Deep Learning']",,"The number of traffic accidents caused by wet or icy road surface conditions is on the rise every year. Car crashes in such bad road conditions can increase fatalities and serious injuries. Historical data (from the year 2016 to the year 2020) on weather-related traffic accidents show that the fatality rates are fairly high in Korea. This requires accurate prediction and identification of hazardous road conditions. In this study, a forecasting model is developed to predict the chances of traffic accidents that can occur on roads affected by weather and road surface conditions. Multiple deep learning algorithms taking into account AlexNet and 2D-CNN are employed. Data on orthophoto images, automatic weather systems, automated synoptic observing systems, and road surfaces are used for training and testing purposes. The orthophotos images are pre-processed before using them as input data for the modeling process. The procedure involves image segmentation techniques as well as the Z-Curve index. Results indicate that there is an acceptable performance of prediction such as 65% for dry, 46% for moist, and 33% for wet road conditions. The overall accuracy of the model is 53%.

The behavior change of the PSA plant according to the performance degradation was trained using a deep learning algorithm based on the developed simulator. The model combines the 1D convolutional neural network and long-short-term memory (LSTM) network. The prediction of the degradation degree of the internal adsorbent was then presented using a pretrained neural network. The developed methodology demonstrates a mean squared error lower than 10−6 when predicting the degree of adsorbent degradation from the adsorption-bed-temperature time-series profiles with an example. The methodology can be used to predictive maintenance strategy by identifying PSA performance degradation in real time without stopping operation."
A study on the effectiveness of intermediate features in deep learning on facial expression recognition,2023,"['Intermediate Feature', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Facial Expression Recognition']",,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of intermediate features on FER performance. To achieve this objective, intermediate features were extracted from the input images at specific layers (FM1~FM4) of the pre-trained network (Resnet-18). These extracted intermediate features and original images were used as inputs to the vision transformer (ViT), and the FER performance was compared. As a result, when using a single image as input, using intermediate features extracted from FM2 yielded the best performance (training accuracy: 94.35%, testing accuracy: 75.51%). When using the original image as input, the training accuracy was 91.32% and the testing accuracy was 74.68%. However, when combining the original image with intermediate features as input, the best FER performance was achieved by combining the original image with FM2, FM3, and FM4 (training accuracy: 97.88%, testing accuracy: 79.21%). These results imply that incorporating intermediate features alongside the original image can lead to superior performance. The findings can be referenced and utilized when designing the preprocessing stages of a deep learning model in FER. By considering the effectiveness of using intermediate features, practitioners can make informed decisions to enhance the performance of FER systems."

This paper proposes a technique that can minimize the number of active grids from holographic grid arrays (HGA) for confirming the requirement of lower power toward beamforming to serve target-oriented users. Therefore, we formulated a problem by maximizing the signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR), which, in turn, maximizes the efficient resource allocation for the users by generating effective beamforming and controlling the sum-power rule. Additionally, our holography-assisted mMIMO system is capable of serving heterogeneous user equipment simultaneously with a lower power budget. To devise the artificial intelligence (AI)-based solution, we developed a sequential neural network model for grid activation decisions with minimized power constraint. Finally, the simulation and performance evaluation results show that power was allocated efficiently, and effective beams were formed for serving the users with a lower RMSE score of 0.01."

Online New Media Oriented Privacy Data Recognition Mechanism Based on Deep Learning,2023,"['Face Recognition', 'GAN', 'New Media', 'Privacy Data Recognition.']",,"Although the current face de-recognition algorithm can effectively protect the user's identity, it will change the original attributes of the im-age, destroy the visual effect, or change the characteristics of the image to varying degrees. Traditional methods such as pixelation and occlu-sion can effectively realize face de-recognition, but the processed image cannot be used for basic processing such as face statistics and expres-sion recognition, which greatly destroys the usability of the image in the field of online new media. In order to preserve more attributes of the original image and reduce the changes of facial skin color and texture features caused by the above de-recognition algorithm's operation on the whole facial area, this paper proposes a privacy protection model of face image based on generative adversarial network and facial feature analysis. Our model realizes face recognition based on changing the original image as little as possible. Specifically, we identify and extract features from fixed parts in face images, including eyes, nose, mouth, eyebrows, and cheeks. Then, we designed a face privacy recognition and protection model based on conditional generative adversarial networks. We verify our proposed method on two most commonly used face datasets in face research, namely CelebFaces Attributes and Labeled Faces in the Wild, and the results show that our proposed method achieve better performance compared with other face privacy protection methods."
A Low Power Mixed Signal Convolutional Neural Network for Deep Learning SoC,2023,"['Convolutional Operation', 'Analog Multiplier', 'Neural Network Accelerator', 'Convolutional Neural Network.']",,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are getting fame due to their simpler design and higher performance. However, CNNs suffer from a large area and power consumption constraints. The multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) unit, which performs the convolution operation inside a CNN, consumes a significant amount of power consumption. In this study, we propose a mixed-signal approach for implementing analog MAC unit that can replace the digital MAC unit in CNNs. The Analog MAC unit architecture is constituted from binary weighted current steering digital-to-analog (DAC) circuit and capacitors. A digital parallel interface is designed to provide input image and filter values to the MAC unit. To realize a complete CNN model a low-power analog-to-digital (ADC) is then employed at the output to convert the final value back to a digital value. When a 3×3 convolution is performed, the analog MAC unit offers a 10.7% reduction in area and a 59.2% reduction in power consumption compared to its fully digital counterparts."

The dose maps generated from Monte Carlo (MC) simulations were used as the reference approach and targetimages for network training. The multiple VSV approach was used for residual learning and compared with dose maps generatedfrom deep learning. The conventional 3D U-Net network was modified for residual learning. The absorbed doses inthe organs were calculated as the mass-weighted average of the volume of interest (VOI).Results The DL approach provided a slightly more accurate estimation than the multiple-VSV approach, but the resultswere not statistically significant. The single-VSV approach yielded a relatively inaccurate estimation. No significant differencewas noted between the multiple VSV and DL approach on the dose maps. However, this difference was prominent inthe error maps. The multiple VSV and DL approach showed a similar correlation. In contrast, the multiple VSV approachunderestimated doses in the low-dose range, but it accounted for the underestimation when the DL approach was applied.Conclusion Dose estimation using the deep learning–based approach was approximately equal to that in the MC simulation.Accordingly, the proposed deep learning network is useful for accurate and fast dosimetry after radiation therapy using177Lu-labeled radiopharmaceuticals."
Supervised pre-training for improved stability in deep reinforcement learning,2023,"['Deep reinforcement learning', 'Pre-training', 'Supervised learning', 'Maximum entropy', 'Stability']",,"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technology has been actively studied with the recent advances in deep learning. As a result, the researchers are continuously improving performance and expanding the applications. However, recent literature reports that the performance of DRL is sensitive to the various design choices, e.g., the neural network initialization. Accordingly, it makes DRL hard to obtain a stable performance, which degrades reproducibility. Therefore, we propose a supervised pre-training method for both policy and value networks to improve stability. We pre-train the policy network to maximize the initial entropy and pre-train the value network to bias the distribution to a specific value. The experiments are conducted on tasks with discrete action space where it is hard to control the initial entropy. Through the experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of stability and performance is validated."

We created a source model using panoramic radiographs including mandibular radiolucent cyst-like lesions (radicular cyst, dentigerous cyst, odontogenic keratocyst, and ameloblastoma). The model was simulatively transferred and trained on images of Stafne’s bone cavity. A learning model was created using a customized DetectNet built in the Digits version 5.0 (NVIDIA, Santa Clara, CA).

In the second stage, the generator of E-GAIL is further reinforced and achieves self-learn decision-making in the simulator with challenging traffic conditions. The E-GAIL is tested in general and challenging traffic conditions. By comparing the evaluation metrics of time to collision (TTC), deceleration to avoid a crash (DRAC), space gap (SGAP) and time gap (TGAP), the E-GAIL greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art decision-making algorithms.

Robot Subgoal-guided Navigation in Dynamic Crowded Environments with Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning,2023,"['Collision avoidance', 'graph attention networks', 'hierarchical deep reinforcement learning', 'robot navigation.']",,"Although deep reinforcement learning has recently achieved some successes in robot navigation, there are still unsolved problems. Particularly, a robot guided by a distant ultimate goal is easy to get stuck in danger or encounter collisions in dynamic crowded environments due to the lack of long-term perspectives. In this paper, a novel subgoal-guided approach based on two-level hierarchical deep reinforcement learning with spatial-temporal graph attention networks (ST-GANets), called SG-HDRL, is proposed for a robot navigating in a dynamic crowded environment with autonomous obstacles, e.g., crowd. Specifically, the high-level policy, that models the spatialtemporal relation between the robot and the obstacles using the obstacles’ trajectories by the designed high-level ST-GANet, generates intermediate subgoals from a longer-term perspective over higher temporal scales. The subgoals give a favorable and collision-free direction to avoid encountering danger or collisions while approaching the ultimate goal. The low-level policy, that similarly implements the designed low-level ST-GANet to implicitly predict the obstacles’ motions, takes the subgoals as short-term guidance through an intrinsic reward incentive to generate primitive actions for the robot. Simulation results demonstrate that SG-HDRL using ST-GANets has better performances compared with state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, the proposed SG-HDRL is deployed to an experimental platform based on omnidirectional cars, and experiment results validate the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed SG-HDRL."
An autonomous radiation source detection policy based on deep reinforcement learning with generalized ability in unknown environments,2023,"['Radiation source detection', 'Deep reinforcement learning', 'Hierarchical learning']",,"Autonomous radiation source detection has long been studied for radiation emergencies. Compared to conventional data-driven or path planning methods, deep reinforcement learning shows a strong capacity in source detection while still lacking the generalized ability to the geometry in unknown environments.In this work, the detection task is decomposed into two subtasks: exploration and localization.A hierarchical control policy (HC) is proposed to perform the subtasks at different stages. The low-level controller learns how to execute the individual subtasks by deep reinforcement learning, and the highlevel controller determines which subtasks should be executed at the current stage. In experimental tests under different geometrical conditions, HC achieves the best performance among the autonomous decision policies. The robustness and generalized ability of the hierarchy have been demonstrated"
Deep reinforcement learning for a multi-objective operation in a nuclear power plant,2023,"['Nuclear power plant', 'Automation', 'Deep reinforcement learning', 'Soft actor-critic', 'Hindsight experience replay']",,"Nuclear power plant (NPP) operations with multiple objectives and devices are still performed manually by operators despite the potential for human error. These operations could be automated to reduce the burden on operators; however, classical approaches may not be suitable for these multi-objective tasks.An alternative approach is deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which has been successful in automating various complex tasks and has been applied in automation of certain operations in NPPs. But despite the recent progress, previous studies using DRL for NPP operations have limitations to handle complex multi-objective operations with multiple devices efficiently. This study proposes a novel DRL-based approach that addresses these limitations by employing a continuous action space and straightforward binary rewards supported by the adoption of a soft actor-critic and hindsight experience replay. The feasibility of the proposed approach was evaluated for controlling the pressure and volume of the reactor coolant while heating the coolant during NPP startup. The results show that the proposed approach can train the agent with a proper strategy for effectively achieving multiple objectives through the control of multiple devices. Moreover, hands-on testing results demonstrate that the trained agent is capable of handling untrained objectives, such as cooldown, with substantial success"
Heave reduction of payload through crane control based on deep reinforcement learning using dual offshore cranes,2023,"['deep deterministic policy gradient', 'reinforcement learning', 'ocean environment', 'offshore crane', 'crane control']",,"Offshore operation causes the dynamic motion of offshore cranes and payload by the ocean environment. The motion of the payload lowers the safety and efficiency of the work, which may increase the working time or cause accidents. Therefore, we design a control method for the crane using artificial intelligence to minimize the heave motion of the payload. Herein, reinforcement learning (RL), which calculates actions according to states, is applied. Furthermore, the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is used because the actions need to be determined in a continuous state. In the DDPG algorithm, the state is defined as the motion of the crane and speed of the wire rope, and the action is defined as the speed of the wire rope. In addition, the reward is calculated using the motion of the payload. In this study, the heave motion of the payload was reduced by developing an agent suitable for adjusting the length of the wire rope. The heave motion of the payload was compared in between the non-learning condition of the RL-based control and proportional integral differential (PID) control; and an average payload reduction rate of 30% was observed under RL-based control. The RL-based control performed better than the PID control under learned conditions."

Compensated Motion and Position Estimation of a Cable-driven Parallel Robot Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning,2023,"['Cable-driven parallel robot', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'motion control.']",,"Unlike conventional rigid-link parallel robots, cable-driven parallel robots (CDPRs) have distinct advantages, including lower inertia, higher payload-to-weight ratio, cost-efficiency, and larger workspaces. However, because of the complexity of the cable configuration and redundant actuation, model-based forward kinematics and motion control necessitate high effort and computation. This study overcomes these challenges by introducing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) into the cable robot and achieves compensated motion control by estimating the actual position of the end-effector. We used a random behavior strategy on a CDPR to explore the environment, collect data, and train neural networks. We then apply the trained network to the CDPR and verify its efficacy. We also addressed the problem of asynchronous state observation and action execution by delaying the action execution time in one cycle and adding this action to be executed to match the motion control command. Finally, we implemented the proposed control method to a high payload cable robot system and verified the feasibility through simulations and experiments. The results demonstrate that the end-effector position estimation accuracy can be improved compared with the numerical model-based forward kinematics solution and the position control error can be reduced compared with the conventional open-loop control and the open-loop control with tension distribution form."

Learning the distribution of English -al and -ar suffixes using deep neural networks,2023,"['English suffix', 'deep neural networks', 'liquid dissimilation', 'lateral dissimilation', 'classification']",,"This study utilized an ensemble of recurrent and convolution neural networks, labeled deep neural networks (DNN) to learn the variable distribution of English suffixes -al and -ar. The DNN predictions were compared against the predictions of the maximum entropy phonotactic learner (PL). An examination of 1,479 adjectives suffixed with -al and -ar revealed that the suffix and the stem-final segment always underwent liquid dissimilation if the stem-final segment was a liquid (e.g. solar, plural). The suffix was -ar if the stem-final segment was /l/; conversely, the suffix -al occurred after /r/. The suffixes were found to vary if the stem-final segment was not liquid (e.g. local, lunar). The learning results revealed that the DNN exhibited higher classification accuracy (97.3%) than the PL (89.4%). The PL assigned higher or equal probabilities to unattested word forms than to attested ones in 10.5% of the test data. The DNN successfully learned the variable distribution patterns of the suffixes observed in the training data. The probability of the suffix -al being predicted by the DNN also effectively showed the gradual distance effects of liquids on liquid dissimilation and segmental blocking.

This study aimed to estimate the transpiration amount of tomatoes and find a suitable model using mathematical and deep learning models using minute-by-minute data. Pearson correlation revealed that observed environmental variables significantly correlate with crop transpiration. Inside air temperature and outside radiation positively correlated with transpiration, while humidity showed a negative correlation. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Polynomial Regression model, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Long short-term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models were built and compared their accuracies. All models showed potential in estimating transpiration with R2 values ranging from 0.770 to 0.948 and RMSE of 0.495 mm/min to 1.038 mm/min in the test dataset. Deep learning models outperformed the mathematical models; the GRU demonstrated the best performance in the test data with 0.948 R2 and 0.495 mm/min RMSE. The LSTM and ANN closely followed with R2 values of 0.946 and 0.944, respectively, and RMSE of 0.504 m/min and 0.511, respectively. The GRU model exhibited superior performance in short-term forecasts while LSTM for long-term but requires verification using a large dataset. Compared to the FAO56 Penman-Monteith (PM) equation, PM has a lower RMSE of 0.598 mm/min than MLR and Polynomial models degrees 2 and 3 but performed least among all models in capturing variability in transpiration.

The aim of this study was to design a decision system based on machine learning algorithms by using clinical measurements and radiographic images in order to determine and facilitate the staging and grading of periodontitis.Methods: In the first part of this study, machine learning models were created using the Python programming language based on clinical data from 144 individuals who presented to the Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Süleyman Demirel University. In the second part, panoramic radiographic images were processed and classification was carried out with deep learning algorithms.Results: Using clinical data, the accuracy of staging with the tree algorithm reached 97.2%, while the random forest and k-nearest neighbor algorithms reached 98.6% accuracy. The best staging accuracy for processing panoramic radiographic images was provided by a hybrid network model algorithm combining the proposed ResNet50 architecture and the support vector machine algorithm. For this, the images were preprocessed, and high success was obtained, with a classification accuracy of 88.2% for staging. However, in general, it was observed that the radiographic images provided a low level of success, in terms of accuracy, for modeling the grading of periodontitis.Conclusions: The machine learning-based decision system presented herein can facilitate periodontal diagnoses despite its current limitations. Further studies are planned to optimize the algorithm and improve the results."

Slicing-Based Resource Optimization in Multi-Access Edge Network Using Ensemble Learning Aided DDPG Algorithm,2023,"['Content caching', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'ensemble learning', 'multi-access edge computing', 'network slicing.']",,"Recently, the technological development in edgecomputing and content caching can provide high-quality servicesfor users in the wireless communication networks. As a promisingtechnology, multi-access edge computing (MEC) can offload tasksto the nearby edge servers, which alleviates the pressure ofusers. However, various services and dynamic wireless channelconditions make effective resource allocation challenging.

Multi-task Transfer Learning Facilitated by Segmentation and Denoising for Anomaly Detection of Rail Fasteners,2023,"['Anomaly detection', 'Railway fastener', 'Multi-task transfer learning', 'Segmentation', 'Denoising']",,"The rail fastener is the main component of rail tracks that contributes to safe train travel by fixing the rail to railroad ties. Anomalies such as the absence or damage should be checked regularly as they can lead to large-scale accidents. Image-based maintenance systems have been proposed as efficient management, but it is still difficult to detect anomalies due to occlusion by obstacles or noise in the image. Therefore, we propose a deep anomaly detection system for rail fasteners using multi-task transfer learning.

De-identifying transmission system using wireless channel as differential privacy noise and deep neural networks,2023,['De-identifying transmissionDifferential privacyDeep-learning based communication system'],,"In order to deal with the unprecedented problem of data privacy in deep-learning based computer vision technologies, we propose a de-identifying transmission system that utilizes a wireless channel as differential privacy (DP) noise and is constructed using deep neural networks. By following the Gaussian mechanism of DP, we present that the signal received at a receiver can be considered as a Gaussian mechanism. Then, we discuss the relationship between the signal-to-noise ratio of a received signal and the privacy budget of DP, and introduce how to control transmit power to achieve a specific privacy budget. The proposed system can be divided into three parts, named transmitter, wireless channel, and receiver. The transmitter and receiver are constructed by using deep-learning networks. The transmitter consists of an image encoder network based on a neural network and a power control module that controls the transmit power for adjusting the level of de-identification. The wireless channel acts as differential privacy noise, and anonymizes the transmitted image feature vector extracted from the transmitter’s image encoder network. The receiver includes a post-processing network and an image decoder network, which are also implemented by using deep neural networks. The post-processing network is proposed for high-quality decoded face images at the receiver, which maps received feature vectors perturbed by a wireless channel back into the latent space of deep-learning based image encoder and decoder networks. Finally, extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations confirm that the proposed system can well de-identify transmitted face images only by controlling the transmit power while maintaining the usefulness of decoded face images. The proposed system shows that the Recall@1 is smaller than 5.2 and the face detection probability is larger than 90 % at SNR=2 dB. Since the de-identification process is performed by wireless channel noise, the proposed system does not require de-identification processing at a transmitter, and thus there is no burden on the transmitter to anonymize face images. Moreover, the additional advantage of this proposed system is that the level of de-identification can be controlled only by changing the transmit power. This proposed de-identification system can be utilized in a wireless image acquisition scenario where images are captured from a wireless edge, such as a CCTV camera, and then sent to a server while protecting people’s privacy."
Nutrient Defect Detection In Plant Leaf Imaging Analysis Using Incremental Learning Approach With Multifrequency Visible Light Approach,2023,"['Plant', 'Leaf', 'Disease', 'Nutrient', 'Multifrequency', 'Machine learning', 'Intensive learning', 'Incremental learning', 'Image processing', 'Signal analysis']",,"Nutrient deficiency during growth is a major cause of reduced yield for wide variety of plants. Yield can be improved if nutrient levels are regularly checked, and maintained using proper fertilization & pest control. In order to perform this task, a wide variety of image processing systems models have been developed, which aim at analysing plant imagery to look for visually apparent nutrient deficient patterns. But these systems are able to identify nutrient deficiencies after the plant is affected by them. In contrast to this, intrusive systems are developed which perform chemical analysis on leaf samples in order to estimate these deficiencies. Performing such chemical analysis limits their testing capabilities because random leaf samples are taken for evaluation, thereby limiting their accuracy. In order to remove these drawbacks, this text proposes a nonintrusive multifrequency visible light analysis framework, that can be used for identification of multiple nutrient deficiencies for a wide variety of plants. In order to map spatial & temporal light properties with nutrient shortages with high accuracy, this framework leverages extensive learning. In order to authenticate the readings, the framework also processes nonintrusive microscopic photos of the same plant leaf using a deep learning technique. This is accomplished by an incremental learning technique that combines the high-efficiency classification capabilities of the VGGNet19 and XceptionNet models. The model can be used for proactive nutrient monitoring and to conduct corrective actions to improve yield quality because it is nonintrusive. The proposed model was evaluated for potassium, nitrogen, copper, zinc, and phosphorus deficit in orange, cotton, apple, banana, mango, litchi, henna, gooseberry, and okra leaf. It was observed that the proposed approach is able to achieve 99.7% accuracy for detection of potassium, 97.2% for nitrogen, 98.5% for copper, 96.8% for zinc, and 95.9% for detection of phosphorus. This accuracy was evaluated by finding average performance of the model for different leaf types, and was compared with various state-of-the-art models. It was observed that the proposed approach has 8% better accuracy than previously described models, and showcases better precision, recall, and fMeasure performance. Due to intensive learning, the model requires large initial delay of training, but evaluation speed is at par with recent state-of-the-art models."
Deep Fusion: Illuminant Estimation using a Camera and  a Spectral Sensor,2023,"['Color constancy', 'Illuminant estimation', 'Multi-spectral imaging']",,"In this study, we present a novel deep-fusion architecture aimed at enhancing color prediction for a light source by leveraging both spectral sensor and image. Recently, the advancements in sensor technology have led to the emergence of spectral sensors capable of capturing multi-wavelength information. While images obtained from camera sensors provide abundant pixel-level details, the information pertaining to wavelength is limited to the conventional RGB channels. Therefore, our approach introduces a deep learning framework that simultaneously integrates images, spectral information, and their combined representation. By comparing the performance of various architectures when predicting the light source color, we identify the most suitable structure and verify the helpfulness of multi-wavelength information without spatial information. To achieve this, we construct a dataset that captures both spectrum and image data concurrently, which are then utilized for conducting experiments."

In particular, massive MIMO systems that employ grant-free (GF) multiple access have recently been studied, aiming to effectively satisfy the uplink transmission requirements of URLLCs. However, the conventional approach to channel estimation in MIMO systems relies on orthogonal pilot signals, necessitating inter-device synchronization. This limitation causes challenges in the integration of GF multiple access with massive MIMO, due to the inherent difficulty in achieving device synchronization within GF multiple access. To overcome this limitation, we propose a learning-based channel estimation method in massive MIMO systems using non-orthogonal pilots. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a bit error rate of less than 10-3 for scenarios with 32, 64, and 128 received antennas and 2 devices, as well as scenarios with 128 received antennas and 2 or 3 devices, at signal-to-noise ratio levels above 0 dB.

Electrocardiogram (ECG), electrodermal activity (EDA), respiration (RESP), and peripheral temperature (PT) of the participants were measured during three experimental phases: rest, stress, and recovery. Eleven physiological features were extracted from each phase and used as input data. Logistic regression (LoR), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms were implemented with nested cross-validation. Linear regression analysis showed that ECG and PT features obtained in the stress and recovery phases were significant predictors of PD. We achieved the highest accuracy (75.61%) with MLP using all 33 features. With the exception of MLP, applying the significant predictors led to a higher accuracy than using 24 ECG features. These results suggest that combining multimodal physiological signals measured during various states of autonomic arousal has the potential to differentiate patients with PD from HCs."

Traditionally, researchers have combined EEG signals with bio-signals (BSs) to enhance the classification performance of emotional states. Our objective was to explore the synergistic effects of coupling EEG and BSs, and determine whether the combination of EEG+BS improves the classification accuracy of emotional states compared to using EEG alone or combining EEG with pseudo-random signals (PS) generated arbitrarily by random generators. Employing four feature extraction methods, we examined four combinations: EEG alone, EG+BS, EEG+BS+PS, and EEG+PS, utilizing data from two widely-used open datasets.Emotional states (task versus rest states) were classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classifiers. Our results revealed that when using the highest accuracy SVM-FFT, the average error rates of EEG+BS were 4.7% and 6.5% higher than those of EEG+PS and EEG alone, respectively. We also conducted a thorough analysis of EEG+BS by combining numerous PSs. The error rate of EEG+BS+PS displayed a V-shaped curve, initially decreasing due to the deep double descent phenomenon, followed by an increase attributed to the curse of dimensionality. Consequently, our findings suggest that the combination of EEG+BS may not always yield promising classification performance."

The power allocation process to each user equipment in the base station coverage takes a long time and is inefficient, hence numerous base stations are deployed to serve multiple user equipments. As a result, we develop a deep neural network (DNN) framework in which the user’s equipment position is utilized to train the deep model, which is then used to forecast the ideal power distribution depending on the user’s location. Compared to the traditional optimization approach, the DNN design helps to obtain the optimal solution of the power allocation problem within a short time via a quick-inference process.

By considering a linear system for the bubble population inversion, Adaptive Learned Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm (Ada-LISTA), which has been solved linear systems in image processing, is used as a neural network architecture in PINN. Furthermore, a regularization based on the linear system is added to a loss function of PINN and it makes a PINN have better generalization by a solution satisfying the bubble physics. To evaluate an uncertainty of bubble estimation, deep ensemble is adopted. 20 Ada-LISTAs with different initial values are trained using the same training dataset. During test with attenuation losses different from those in the training dataset, the bubble size distribution and corresponding uncertainty are indicated by average and variance of 20 estimations, respectively. Deep ensemble Ada-LISTA demonstrate superior performance in inverting bubble size distributions than the conventional convex optimization solver of CVX."
Transfer Learning Models for Enhanced Prediction of Cracked Tires,2023,"['Deep Learning', 'Transfer Learning', 'CNN', 'Cracked Tires Prediction', 'DenseNet121']",,"Regularly inspecting vehicle tires' condition is imperative for driving safety and comfort. Poorly maintained tires can pose fatal risks, leading to accidents. Unfortunately, manual tire visual inspections are often considered no less laborious than employing an automatic tire inspection system. Nevertheless, an automated tire inspection method can significantly enhance driver compliance and awareness, encouraging routine checks. Therefore, there is an urgency for automated tire inspection solutions. Here, we focus on developing a deep learning (DL) model to predict cracked tires. The main idea of this study is to demonstrate the comparative analysis of DenseNet121, VGG-19 and EfficientNet Convolution Neural Network-based (CNN) Transfer Learning (TL) and suggest which model is more recommended for cracked tire classification tasks. To measure the model's effectiveness, we experimented using a publicly accessible dataset of 1028 images categorized into two classes. Our experimental results obtain good performance in terms of accuracy, with 0.9515. This shows that the model is reliable even though it works on a dataset of tire images which are characterized by homogeneous color intensity."
Fault diagnosis of rolling bearing under limited samples using joint learning network based on local-global feature perception,2023,['· Fault diagnosis · Dynamic perception · Joint learning network · Global channel attention · Limited samples'],,"Deep learning is widely used in the field of rolling bearing fault diagnosis because of its excellent advantages in data analysis. However, in practical industrial scenarios, the capability of intelligent fault diagnosis (IFD) method is still affected by two problems: (1) The signal samples provided for network learning are limited; (2) Fully extracting feature information from the original data is difficult. To address the above issues, a novel fault diagnosis method using joint learning network (JLNet) based on local-global feature perception is proposed. The method enhances the learning mechanism of fault signal through the local information dynamic perception subnetwork, which dynamically distinguishes between local impulse segment and normal signal segment. Then, a global channel attention mechanism (CAM) is used to guide the assignment of weights, which helps bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) to learn advanced discriminative features. The feature information of the original signal is thoroughly mined through local-global comprehensive perception, thus realizing efficient diagnosis. In addition, the variation of the characteristics of each layer is analyzed by visualization, which improves the interpretability of the network. Finally, experiments are conducted using two different datasets, and the results show that JLNet has a better diagnostic effects and robustness."

ISFRNet: A Deep Three-stage Identity and Structure Feature Refinement Network for Facial Image Inpainting,2023,"['Deep Learning', 'Image Inpainting', 'GAN']",,"Modern image inpainting techniques based on deep learning have achieved remarkable performance, and more and more people are working on repairing more complex and larger missing areas, although this is still challenging, especially for facial image inpainting. For a face image with a huge missing area, there are very few valid pixels available; however, people have an ability to imagine the complete picture in their mind according to their subjective will. It is important to simulate this capability while maintaining the identity features of the face as much as possible. To achieve this goal, we propose a three-stage network model, which we refer to as the identity and structure feature refinement network (ISFRNet). ISFRNet is based on 1) a pre-trained pSp-styleGAN model that generates an extremely realistic face image with rich structural features; 2) a shallow structured network with a small receptive field; and 3) a modified U-net with two encoders and a decoder, which has a large receptive field. We choose structural similarity index (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), L1 Loss and learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) to evaluate our model. When the missing region is 20%-40%, the above four metric scores of our model are 28.12, 0.942, 0.015 and 0.090, respectively. When the lost area is between 40% and 60%, the metric scores are 23.31, 0.840, 0.053 and 0.177, respectively. Our inpainting network not only guarantees excellent face identity feature recovery but also exhibits state-of-the-art performance compared to other multi-stage refinement models."

In order to address this issue, QDU leverages an iterative algorithm and analytical derivation to enhance the sum rate performance and training processes by optimizing power allocation and transmit precoding. The proposed approach integrates a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) induced by an iterative deep unfolding algorithm with a learning solution inspired by the training process.

As hypertension is one of the leading causes of CVDs, keeping hypertensionunder control by a timely screening of subjects becomes lifesaving. This work proposes estimating BP from motion artifactaffectedphotoplethysmography signals (PPG) by applying signal processing techniques in realtime. This paper proposes adeep neural network-based methodology to accurately classify PPG signals using a Fourier theory-based time–frequency(TF) spectrogram. This work uses the Fourier decomposition method (FDM) to transform a PPG signal into a TF spectrogram.In the proposed work, the last three layers of the pre-trained deep neural network, namely, GoogleNet, DenseNet, andAlexNet, are modified and then used to classify the PPG signal into normotension, pre-hypertension, and hypertension. Theproposed framework is trained and tested using the MIMIC-III and PPG–BP databases using five-fold training and testing.Out of the three deep neural networks, the proposed framework with the DenseNet-201 network performs best, with a testaccuracy of 96.5%. The proposed work uses FDM to compute the TF spectrogram to accurately separate the motion artifactsand noise components from a noise-corrupted PPG signal. Capturing more frequency components that contain moreinformation from PPG signals makes the deep neural networks extract better and more meaningful features. Thus, training adeep neural network model with clean PPG signal features improves the generalized capability of a BP classification modelwhen tested in realtime."

Abnormal neck and scapula posture are thought to play a role in shoulder pain. Traditional statistical methods like logistic regression have limitations in capturing complex relationships, while machine learning (ML) can model nonlinear relationships effectively.Purpose The purpose of the present study was to develop, evaluate, and compare the predictive performance of ML models and logistic regression for classifying food service workers (FWs) with and without PPH based on postural analysis data.Study design Cross sectional study.Methods FWs (n=150) meeting specific criteria were assessed for PPH and underwent postural analysis. ML algorithms (logistic regression, neural network, random forest, gradient boosting, decision tree, and support vector machine) were used for classification. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score. Feature importance was assessed.Results Gradient boosting exhibited the best performance (AUC: 0.867) in classifying PPH, followed by random forest (AUC: 0.822) in the test dataset. Logistic regression performed less effectively (AUC: 0.613).

Intelligent Multi-Path TCP Congestion Control for video streaming in Internet of Deep Space Things communication,2023,['Internet of deep space thingsMulti-path TCPScalable video codingHead of line blocking'],,"The vision of space exploration includes missions to deep space that produce significant amounts of video data and require reliable video streaming back to the Earth. The Internet of Deep Space Things (IoDST) is envisioned to provide communication services for video data streaming for the mission spacecrafts. Ensuring reliable communications in IoDST requires Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) layer functionalities. However, current TCP Congestion Control (CC) protocols provide poor performance in IoDST communications primarily owing to the dependence on pre-defined rules to determine the transmission rate in a single path TCP flow. This paper proposes a Multi-Path TCP (MPTCP) CC design for data streaming transmission in IoDST. We utilized Scalable Video Coding (SVC)-based streaming to overcome the Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking and proposed an intelligent CC scheme based on Q-learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN) to solve the problems of challenging link conditions in IoDST. Our proposed CC scheme determines the optimal congestion window for data transmission in IoDST communications to maximize the TCP throughput performance and streaming data playback. Simulation results show that our proposed CC scheme achieves TCP throughput performance by up to approximately 257.14% and 73.08% compared to TCP CUBIC and TCP Westwood. In addition, video streaming playback by up to approximately 164.86%, 104.17%, 75%, 157.89% and 66% compared to TCP CUBIC, TCP BBR, TCP Westwood, DRL-TCP and QLE-DS, respectively.

Development of Data-based Hierarchical Learning Model for Predicting Condition Rating of Bridge Members Over Time,2023,"['Bridge maintenance', 'Bridge deterioration', 'Deterioration model', 'Deep learning', 'National bridge inventory']",,"Bridge maintenance strategy is implemented to ensure that effective decisions are made based on the evaluation of the current performance and predicted future conditions of a bridge. The current bridge maintenance system relies on traditional manpower-based methods to determine bridge performance. However, the present techniques employ a material deterioration model that has uncertainty in predicting bridge performance. Moreover, the utilization of collected bridge inspection-related data is insignificant, and related research is lacking. Accordingly, a new type of bridge deterioration model is proposed using state performance data based on bridge inspection. To formulate the deterioration model, bridge condition inspection data accumulated over a long period were utilized. The data have been continuously updated since 1992 by the US Federal Highway Administration and consist of basic information and various influencing factors of bridges. The developed model uses the long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm (a type of recurrent neural network) as well as layer normalization and label smoothing to improve the applicability of fundamental data. For the stable application of data, predicting the model performance for up to 30 years every 2 years is possible. By implementing the many-to-many type of the LSTM algorithm, the predicted probability of each grade derived for each sequence was weighted and averaged with the grade value to derive a continuous state grade result. Thus, the proposed model can express discrete historical degradation indices in continuous form according to the service life. In addition, it enables the prediction of bridge performance using only the fundamental information regarding new and existing bridges. For the effective use of basic data, an optimization model was derived using preprocessing and various regularization techniques. Additionally, a feed-forward deep learning model and stochastic model were developed using the same data. For performance assessment, a regression analysis evaluation method was applied, and comparative analysis was performed using the inspection data of an actual bridge.

Current PM2.5 forecasting systems are primarily based on the chemical transport model of CommunityMultiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling systems and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. However, theforecasting accuracies of these models are substantially constrained by uncertainties in the input data of anthropogenic emissionsand meteorological fields, as well as inherent limitations in the models. The PM2.5 forecasting system developed inthis study aimed at overcoming the limitations of CMAQ predictions by utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms. Theproposed system was developed using forecast data from CMAQ and WRF, as well as observed PM2.5 concentrations andmeteorological variables at monitoring stations in China and South Korea. It was then applied to national PM2.5 forecastingin South Korea. This study focused on developing secondary input data and machine learning models that can reflect thelong-range transport in Northeast Asia. The proposed system can forecast 6-h average PM2.5 concentrations up to two daysin advance at 19 forecast regions in South Korea. To evaluate the performance of the proposed models, a real-time machinelearning-based forecasting system was applied to 19 forecasting regions from January 2020 to April 2021. Herein, the fourmachine learning algorithms applied, including deep neural network, recurrent neural network, convolutional neural network,and Ensemble, could reduce the over-prediction of the CMAQ forecast by decreasing the normal mean bias and improvingthe index of agreement. The reduced false alarm rates and high prediction accuracy confirm the feasibility of these modelsfor practical applications."

It aims to maximize data movement efficiency by moving away from the traditional von Neumann architecture. PIM is particularly well-suited for handling deep neural networks (DNNs) that require significant data movement between the processing unit and the memory device. As a result, there has been substantial research in this area. To optimally handle DNNs with diverse structures and inductive biases, such as convolutional neural networks, graph convolutional networks, recurrent neural networks, and transformers, within a PIM architecture, careful consideration should be given to how data mapping and data flow are processed in PIM. This paper aims to provide insight into these aspects by analyzing the characteristics of various DNNs and providing detailed explanations of how they have been implemented with PIM architectures using commercially available memory technologies like DRAM and next-generation memory technologies like ReRAM."
Distributed Multi-agent Target Search and Tracking With Gaussian Process and Reinforcement Learning,2023,"['Distributed system', 'Gaussian process', 'multi-agent reinforcement learning', 'target search and tracking.']",,"Deploying multiple robots for target search and tracking has many practical applications, yet the challenge of planning over unknown or partially known targets remains difficult to address. With recent advances in deep learning, intelligent control techniques such as reinforcement learning have enabled agents to learn autonomously from environment interactions with little to no prior knowledge. Such methods can address the explorationexploitation tradeoff of planning over unknown targets in a data-driven manner, streamlining the decision-making pipeline with end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning technique (MARL) with target map building based on distributed Gaussian process (GP). We leverage the distributed GP to encode belief over the target locations in a scalable manner and incorporate it into centralized training with decentralized execution MARL framework to efficiently plan over unknown targets.

An Integrated Accurate-Secure Heart Disease Prediction (IAS) Model using Cryptographic and Machine Learning Methods,2023,"['Heart Disease Prediction', 'accuracy', 'integrity', 'Machine learning', 'feature extraction', 'Neural networks']",,"Heart disease is becoming the top reason of death all around the world. Diagnosing cardiac illness is a difficult endeavor that necessitates both expertise and extensive knowledge. Machine learning (ML) is becoming gradually more important in the medical field. Most of the works have concentrated on the prediction of cardiac disease, however the precision of the results is minimal, and data integrity is uncertain. To solve these difficulties, this research creates an Integrated Accurate-Secure Heart Disease Prediction (IAS) Model based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.

A Study on Ship Route Generation with Deep Q Network and Route Following Control,2023,"['ship route generation', 'coastal navigation', 'route following control', 'deep Q network', 'reinforcement learning']",,"Ships need to ensure safety during their navigation, which makes route determination highly important. It must be accompanied by a route following controller that can accurately follow the route. This study proposes a method for automatically generating the ship route based on deep reinforcement learning algorithm and following it using a route following controller. To generate a ship route, under keel clearance was applied to secure the ship's safety and navigation chart information was used to apply ship navigation related regulations. For the experiment, a target ship with a draft of 8.23 m was designated. The target route in this study was to depart from Busan port and arrive at the pilot boarding place of the Ulsan port. As a route following controller, a velocity type fuzzy PID controller that could compensate for the limitation of a linear controller was applied. As a result of using the deep Q network, a route with a total distance of 62.22 km and 81 waypoints was generated. To simplify the route, the Douglas-Peucker algorithm was introduced to reduce the total distance to 55.67 m and the number of way points to 3. After that, an experiment was conducted to follow the path generated by the target ship. Experiment results revealed that the velocity type fuzzy PID controller had less overshoot and fast settling time. In addition, it had the advantage of reducing the energy loss of the ship because the change in rudder angle was smooth. This study can be used as a basic study of route automatic generation. It suggests a method of combining ship route generation with the route following control."
Leveraging Visibility-Based Rewards in DRL-based Worker Travel Path Simulation for Improving the Learning Performance,2023,"['Construction Worker', 'Site Layout Planning', 'Pathfinding', 'Deep Reinforcement Learning', 'Travel Path']",,"Optimization of Construction Site Layout Planning (CSLP) heavily relies on workers' travel paths. However, traditional path generation approaches predominantly focus on the shortest path, often neglecting critical variables such as individual wayfinding tendencies, the spatial arrangement of site objects, and potential hazards. These oversights can lead to compromised path simulations, resulting in less reliable site layout plans. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been proposed as a potential alternative to address these issues, it has shown limitations. Despite presenting more realistic travel paths by considering these variables, DRL often struggles with efficiency in complex environments, leading to extended learning times and potential failures. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a refined model that enhances spatial navigation capabilities and learning performance by integrating workers' visibility into the reward functions. The proposed model demonstrated a 12.47% increase in the pathfinding success rate and notable improvements in the other two performance measures compared to the existing DRL framework. The adoption of this model could greatly enhance the reliability of the results, ultimately improving site operational efficiency and safety management such as by reducing site congestion and accidents. Future research could expand this study by simulating travel paths in dynamic, multi-agent environments that represent different stages of construction."
A Prediction Model for Osteoporosis Risk Using a Machine-Learning Approach and Its Validation in a Large Cohort,2023,"['Osteoporosis', 'Genetic Risk Scores', 'Machine Learning', 'XGboost', 'Deep Neural Network', 'Nutrient Intake', 'Hormone Replacement Therapy']",,"Background: Osteoporosis develops in the elderly due to decreased bone mineral density (BMD), potentially increasing bone fracture risk. However, the BMD is not regularly measured in a clinical setting. This study aimed to develop a good prediction model for the osteoporosis risk using a machine learning (ML) approach in adults over 40 years in the Ansan/Anseong cohort and the association of predicted osteoporosis risk with a fracture in the Health Examinees (HEXA) cohort.Methods: The 109 demographic, anthropometric, biochemical, genetic, nutrient, and lifestyle variables of 8,842 participants were manually selected in an Ansan/Anseong cohort and included in the ML algorithm. The polygenic risk score (PRS) of osteoporosis was generated with a genome-wide association study and added for the genetic impact of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis was defined with < −2.5 T scores of the tibia or radius compared to people in their 20s–30s. They were divided randomly into the training (n = 7,074) and test (n = 1,768) sets—Pearson’s correlation between the predicted osteoporosis risk and fracture in the HEXA cohort.Results: XGBoost, deep neural network, and random forest generated the prediction model with a high area under the curve (AUC, 0.86) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) with 10, 15, and 20 features; the prediction model by XGBoost had the highest AUC of ROC, high accuracy and k-fold values (> 0.85) in 15 features among seven ML approaches. The model included the genetic factor, genders, number of children and breastfed children, age, residence area, education, seasons to measure, height, smoking status, hormone replacement therapy, serum albumin, hip circumferences, vitamin B6 intake, and body weight. The prediction models for women alone were similar to those for both genders, with lower accuracy. When the prediction model was applied to the HEXA study, the correlation between the fracture incidence and predicted osteoporosis risk was significant but weak (r = 0.173, P < 0.001).Conclusion: The prediction model for osteoporosis risk generated by XGBoost can be applied to estimate osteoporosis risk. The biomarkers can be considered for enhancing the prevention, detection, and early therapy of osteoporosis risk in Asians."
DEVELOPMENT OF A LIGHT AND ACCURATE NOX PREDICTION MODEL FOR DIESEL ENGINES USING MACHINE LEARNING AND XAI METHODS,2023,"['Diesel engines', 'NOx prediction model', 'Machine learning', 'Random forest', 'XAI']",,"In the previous research, we had developed a Nitrogen Oxides emissions (NOx) prediction model using deep learning methodology. However, it is necessary to develop a lightweight model for practical application. We developed a machine learning model for predicting NOx using Random Forest method to reduce the negligible input features. For comparison, a Base model was developed with all features. The Shapley Additive Explanations method, which can show the influence of the input features, and the Pearson Correlation Coefficient method, which can show the proportional relationship between the output and the input values, were used to choose the dominant features. The final model was determined using the Shapley Additive Explanations method. The final model shows similar prediction performance to the base model, though it has only 11 features (30 % of the Base model). The final model shows 15.76 for the root mean square error and 0.965 for R2 with the test data. By extracting the dominant features influencing NOx prediction, we could develop a lightweight and accurate NOx prediction model."
Improving Image Monitoring Performance for Underwater Laser Cutting Using a Deep Neural Network,2023,"['Image monitoring', 'Underwater laser cutting', 'Signal processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Deep learning neural network']",,"We designed an efficient signal processing implemented with artificial intelligence using a deep neural network for image monitoring of underwater laser cutting for nuclear power plant dismantling. Monitoring images for underwater laser cutting with intense flames in turbid water are characterized by low visibility while pixel values of an image are distributed over the entire dynamic range. The visibility for underwater laser cutting operations was improved by widely stretching pixel value distribution to the full possible dynamic range after removing excessively dark or bright pixels that are far from the dominant pixel intensity distribution. Here, areas of intense flame where pixel values are close to saturation values are preserved. In addition, an efficiently designed look-up table increases contrast in cutting areas with intense flames, and an image acquisition method using the lowest pixel values in the latest frames reduces intermittent monitoring interference caused by the flames erupting in irregular patterns and flowing bubbles. A deep learning neural network trained with the designed signal processing datasets effectively improved the image monitoring performance in underwater laser cutting experiments."

Learning and Leveraging Conventions in the Design of Haptic Shared Control Paradigms for Steering a Ground Vehicle,2023,"['Conventions and co-adaption', 'haptic shared control', 'human-robot interaction', 'semi-automated vehicles.']",,"The main objective of this paper is to establish a framework to study the co-adaptation between humans and automation systems in a haptic shared control framework. We specifically used this framework to design control transfer strategies between humans and automation systems to resolve a conflict when co-steering a semi-automated ground vehicle. The proposed framework contains three main parts. First, we defined a modular structure to separate partner-specific strategies from task-dependent representations and use this structure to learn different co-adaption strategies. In this structure, we assume the human and automation steering commands can be determined by optimizing cost functions. For each agent, the costs are defined as a combination of a set of hand-coded features and vectors of weights. The hand-coded features can be selected to describe task-dependent representations. On the other hand, the weight distributions over these features can be used as a proxy to determine the partner-specific conventions. Second, to leverage the learned co-adaptation strategies, we developed a map connecting different strategies to the outputs of human-automation interactions by employing a collaborative-competitive game concept. Finally, using the map, we designed an adaptable automation system capable of co-adapting to human driver’s strategies. Specifically, we designed an episode-based policy search using the deep deterministic policy gradients technique to determine the optimal weights vector distribution of automation’s cost function. The simulation results demonstrate that the handover strategies designed based on co-adaption between human and automation systems can successfully resolve a conflict and improve the performance of the human automation teaming."

Eventually, a design of the appropriate reward function governing the ultimate results was presented. Compared with traditional velocity planning, the proposed method can decline moving error by 0.05 degrees under the considerations involving dynamic factors in a robotic arm. Besides, the proposed velocity planning strategy could be obtained after taking the training time of one hour which can meet the demand for the time cost of the industry."

The supervised learning-based deep-learning seismic inversion uses time-domain wavefields as input and subsurface velocity models as output. Because the time-domain wavefields contain various types of wave information, the data size is considerably large. Therefore, research applying supervised learning-based deep-learning seismic inversion trained with a significant amount of field-scale data has not yet been conducted. In this study, we predict subsurface velocity models using Laplace-domain wavefields as input instead of time-domain wavefields to apply a supervised learning-based deep-learning seismic inversion technique to field-scale data. Using Laplace-domain wavefields instead of time-domain wavefields significantly reduces the size of the input data, thereby accelerating the neural network training, although the resolution of the results is reduced. Additionally, a large grid interval can be used to efficiently predict the velocity model of the field data size, and the results obtained can be used as the initial model for subsequent inversions. The neural network is trained using only synthetic data by generating a massive synthetic velocity model and Laplace-domain wavefields of the same size as the field-scale data. In addition, we adopt a towed-streamer acquisition geometry to simulate a marine seismic survey. Testing the trained network on numerical examples using the test data and a benchmark model yielded appropriate background velocity models."

Additionally, this process is time-intensive. Consequently, various studies have been undertaken to detect cavities in GPR survey data using deep learning methods. Deep-learning-based approaches require abundant data for training, but GPR field survey data are often scarce due to cost and other factors constaining field studies. Therefore, in this study, a deep- learning-based model was developed for embankment GPR survey cavity detection using data augmentation strategies. A dataset was constructed by collecting survey data over several years from the same embankment. A you look only once (YOLO) model, commonly used in computer vision for object detection, was employed for this purpose. By comparing and analyzing various strategies, the optimal data augmentation approach was determined. After initial model development, a stepwise process was employed, including box clustering, transfer learning, self-ensemble, and model ensemble techniques, to enhance the final model performance. The model performance was evaluated, with the results demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting cavities in embankment GPR survey data."

However, effective training of such models necessitates a substantial amount ofdiverse training data that considers various weather conditions and vessel states. The lack of such datacan lead to a degradation in the performance of trained models. This study aims to enhance theperformance of deep learning models for distress ship detection by developing a maritime environmentsimulator to augment the dataset. The simulator allows for the configuration of various weatherconditions, vessel states such as sinking or capsizing, and specifications and characteristics of dronesand sensors. Training the deep learning model with the dataset generated through simulation resultedin improved detection performance, including accuracy and recall, when compared to models trainedsolely on actual drone image datasets. In particular, the accuracy of distress ship detection in adverseweather conditions, such as rain or fog, increased by approximately 2–5%, with a significant reductionin the rate of undetected instances. These results demonstrate the practical and effective contributionof the developed simulator in simulating diverse scenarios for model training. Furthermore, the distressship detection deep learning model based on this approach is expected to be efficiently applied inmaritime search and rescue operations."

The WSAS uses a two-stage Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. First, a river overflow prediction module is designed with LSTM to decide whether the river is flooded by predicting the river's water level rise. Second, a vehicle flooding prediction module predicts flooding of underground parking lots by detecting flooded tires with YOLOv5 from CCTV images. Finally, the WSAS automatically installs the water barrier whenever the river overflow and vehicle flooding events happen in the underground parking lots. The only constraint to implementing is that collecting training data for flooded vehicle tires is challenging. This paper exploits the Image C&S data augmentation technique to synthesize flooded tire images. Experimental results validate the superiority of WSAS by showing that the river overflow prediction module can reduce RMSE by three times compared with the previous method, and the vehicle flooding detection module can increase mAP by 20% compared with the naive detection method, respectively."

The app needs to allow consumers to immediately comprehend the restricted ingredients by recognizing the ingredients' words in the cropped image. Two major issues should be solved during the development process: First, although there were flat containers for cosmetics or food, most were curved containers. Thus, it was necessary to recognize the ingredient table displayed on the curved containers. Second, since the ingredients' words were displayed on the curved surface, the transformed or line-changed words also needed to be recognized. The proposed new methods were enough to solve the above two problems. The application developed through various tests verified that there was no problem recognizing the ingredients' words contained in a cylindrical curved container."

This phenomenon is due to the dependence of training samples and structural limitations of neural networks. Accordingly, the inference results of neural networks also often lead to unexpected results.

The proposed method analyzes the time series of images and quantifies the differences to correct the volume analysis error using the backtracking method.

In order to evaluate the results of the AFT, a set of AFT images are captured by high-speed cameras. To detect objects in the AFT image set, ResNet-50 based Faster R-CNN is used as a detection model. However, because of the low resolution of the AFT image set, a detection model has shown low performance. To enhance the performance of the detection model, Super-resolution(SR) methods are used to increase the AFT image set resolution. To this end, The Bicubic method and three SR models: ZSSR, EDSR, and SwinIR are used. The use of SR images results in an increase in the performance of the detection model. While the increase in the number of pixels representing a fragment flame in the AFT images improves the Recall performance of the detection model, the number of pixels representing noise also increases, leading to a slight decreases in Precision performance. Consequently, the F1 score is increased by up to 9 %, demonstrating the effectiveness of SR in enhancing the performance of the detection model."

Afterwards, during regular physical education classes and after-school sessions, learners' performances of flying disc, ball throwing, and passing movements were analyzed and feedback was provided through Teachable Machine. 350 questionnaires were distributed. To prevent incomplete or incorrect answers, teachers paraphrased the questionnaires into easier words, and enough explanation and modeling were provided. Total 350 answers were considered to be effective samples. SPSS Window Version 28.0 was used to analyze statistical data. Frequency analysis and correlation analysis were conducted. To test the hypothesis, AMOS 28.0 was used for confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation model analysis. The results are as follows; First, the alpha generation’s learning experience in deep learning-based physical activities has a meaningful influence on the achievement they have. Second, the alpha generation’s achievement in deep learning-based physical activities has a meaningful effect on the metacognition they have. Third, the alpha generation’s learning experience in deep learning-based physical activities also affects meaningfully on their metacognition. Collectively, this study confirms deep learning-based physical activities can be beneficial for alpha generation, since they improve achievement, and metacognition of alpha generation."

Increasing the reception bandwidth is effective in reducing artifacts, but high-reception bandwidth has the disadvantage of reducing the signal-to-noise ratio of the acquired image; hence, it is difficult to apply it beyond a certain value. Deep learning algorithms are highly effective in increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of the image and uniformly removing background noise across the entire image. In this study, we compared the difference in metal artifacts after acquiring a MARS (metal artifact reduction sequence) protocol that uses a conventional high bandwidth to reduce metal artifacts and a protocol that sets a higher bandwidth (Ultra MARS) and then converted this into a deep learning Ultra MARS using deep learning. After applying deep learning, Ultra MARS measured smaller artifacts than before or with conventional MARS. The overall signal intensity of the artifacts was also smaller than that of the conventional MARS technique. Moreover, SSIM (structural similarity index measure) revealed that the structural similarity before and after applying deep learning was similar. Thus, deep learning algorithms can be used in techniques such as MARS in order to reduce artifacts and it is possible to obtain highlight images with significantly higher values that reduce artifacts while maintaining image contrast."

The performance of these (single) algorithms were compared with that of modified ones processed through hyperparameter tuning, ensemble learning (only for machine learning), and multi-layer stacking (i.e., two layers of LSTM units). The daily effluent of wastewater treatment process observed between 2017 and 2022 in the Cheong-Ju National Industrial Complex was used as input to all tested algorithms, which was evaluated with respect to mean squared error. For the model performance evaluation, discharge and biochemical oxygen demand are selected as dependent variables out of nine measured parameters. Results showed that the performance of any machine learning algorithms was superior to their competitor LSTM. This is mainly attributed to a small amount of input data provided to the LSTM algorithm and unstable effluent wastewater characteristics. Meanwhile, hyperparameter tuning improved the performance of all tested algorithms. However, ensemble learning for machine learning and two-layer stacking for LSTM generally resulted in performance degradation as compared to that of single algorithms, regardless of dependent variables. Therefore, this calls for a careful design and evaluation of modified algorithms, specifically for model architecture and performance improvement processes."

The investment performance of the experimental model was analyzed by finding the optimal parameters based on past data. The experimental model is a volatility breakout strategy(VBS), a Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) model, moving average cross strategy and a combined model. VBS is a short-term trading strategy that buys when volatility rises significantly on a daily basis and sells at the closing price of the day. LSTM is suitable for time series data among deep learning models, and the predicted closing price obtained through the prediction model was applied to the simple trading rule. The moving average cross strategy determines whether to buy or sell when the moving average crosses. The combined model is a trading rule made by using derived variables of the VBS and LSTM model using AND/OR for the buy conditions. The result shows that combined model is better investment performance than the single model.

First, a deep learning model for braille block recognition is trained on a high-performance computer, and the learning model is applied to a lightweight tool to apply to an embedded device. To recognize the walking information of the braille block, an algorithm is used to determine the path using the distance from the braille block in the image. After detecting braille blocks, bollards, and crosswalks through the YOLOv8 model in the video captured by the embedded device, the walking information is recognized through the braille block path discrimination algorithm. We apply the model lightweight tool to YOLOv8 to detect braille blocks in real time.

Furthermore, the speakers in the data should be able to pronounce accurately in most cases. However, in our data, most of the speakers are over the age of 60 and often have incorrect pronunciation.

As more models can calculate point clouds directly, working time has become an essential factor. The down-sampling process can solve this problem. Existing sampling algorithms have performed constant sampling methods regardless of the characteristics of task-model learning. However, this weakness has limitations in improving the performance of the task model in learning, and such task-agnostic methods perform too low when the sampling rate is high.Therefore, this paper proposes a novel down-sampling model network based on deep learning tasks. The proposed network utilizes fully connected layers to extract meaningful features from input sequences, and adds positional encoding instead of a conventional convolution concept. By introducing positional encoding into down sampling, the proposed network learns about the relationship between point clouds, and generates a task-oriented sampling methodology. Furthermore, the network incorporates skip connections to preserve important information during the down-sampling process. The proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art models in terms of classification accuracy. With the fast inference time of the proposed network, it can be used in various applications, and our approach provides a promising solution for down-sampling tasks in different point cloud applications."

However, a Vespa object size in pixels in a natural capture environment is not constant and is smaller than the Vespa object size of images in a training set. This study compares the inference accuracy of deep learning models YOLOv5, YOLOX, and YOLOv7 according to training datasets. As training data, the three types of datasets were prepared as follows. First, A basic dataset, composed of five species of Vespa and one bee, is produced for the Vespa training data set. Next, The 0.3% dataset, in which Hornet object size is approximately 0.3% ratio to the whole image size in pixels, is prepared using the basic dataset for tiny object detection. Finally, images are selected from the basic and the 0.3% datasets in the same proportions in a Mixed dataset. After configuring three types of training datasets, the three deep learning models above were trained using the three training datasets, the basic, the 0.3%, and the Mixed dataset, and calculated the training and test mAP. In cases where the training and test data environments are similar, YOLOv7 demonstrated the highest mAP at 95.4%. However, in a test result experiment for actual environments using trained weights by the basic dataset, the mAP@50 scores are 30%, 14%, and 85% for YOLOv5, YOLOv7, and YOLOX, respectively. That is, YOLOX, an Anchor-free model, is overwhelmingly excellent.

Himawari-8 정지궤도 위성 영상을 활용한 딥러닝 기반 산불 탐지의 효율적 방안 제시,2023,[],,"As wildfires are difficult to predict, real-time monitoring is crucial for a timely response. Geostationary satellite images are very useful for active fire detection because they can monitor a vast area with high temporal resolution (e.g., 2 min). Existing satellite-based active fire detection algorithms detect thermal outliers using threshold values based on the statistical analysis of brightness temperature. However, the difficulty in establishing suitable thresholds for such threshold-based methods hinders their ability to detect fires with low intensity and achieve generalized performance. In light of these challenges, machine learning has emerged as a potential-solution. Until now, relatively simple techniques such as random forest, Vanilla convolutional neural network (CNN), and U-net have been applied for active fire detection. Therefore, this study proposed an active fire detection algorithm using state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning techniques using data from the Advanced Himawari Imager and evaluated it over East Asia and Australia. The SOTA model was developed by applying EfficientNet and lion optimizer, and the results were compared with the model using the Vanilla CNN structure. EfficientNet outperformed CNN with F1-scores of 0.88 and 0.83 in East Asia and Australia, respectively. The performance was better after using weighted loss, equal sampling, and image augmentation techniques to fix data imbalance issues compared to before the techniques were used, resulting in F1-scores of 0.92 in East Asia and 0.84 in Australia. It is anticipated that timely responses facilitated by the SOTA deep learning-based approach for active fire detection will effectively mitigate the damage caused by wildfires."

However, conventional physically- and deep learning-based urban flood modeling methods have limitations that require a lot of computer resources or data for high-resolution flooding analysis. In this study, we propose and implement a method for improving the spatial resolution of urban flood analysis using a deep learning based super-resolution technique. The proposed approach converts low-resolution flood maps by physically based modeling into the high-resolution using a super-resolution deep learning model trained by high-resolution modeling data. When applied to two cases of retrospective flood analysis at part of City of Portland, Oregon, U.S., the results of the 4-m resolution physical simulation were successfully converted into 1-m resolution flood maps through super-resolution. High structural similarity between the super-solution image and the high-resolution original was found. The results show promising image quality loss within an acceptable limit of 22.80 dB (PSNR) and 0.73 (SSIM). The proposed super-resolution method can provide efficient model training with a limited number of flood scenarios, significantly reducing data acquisition efforts and computational costs."

In this study, we developed a deep learning-based gas leak detection model that can obtain not only the gas leak status, but also the gas leak location and flow rate information, by using technology to visualize the ultrasonic waves generated during gas leaks. Research methods are broadly categorized into data collection and model learning methods. First, data was collected using an ultrasonic camera to capture ultrasonic images at different measurement distances (1 and 3 m) and gas leak flow rates (0-8 L/min). YOLO (You Only Look Once) was used for image learning, and the model was trained after setting the class according to the gas-leak flow range. The clarity of the collected ultrasonic images decreased as the measurement distance increased. In addition, there was little difference between the images for each leakage flow rate, posing challenges in distinguishing them with the naked eye.

The absence of data in the near-offset region hinders accurate seismic imaging. Therefore, reconstructing the missing near-offset information is crucial for mitigating the influence of seismic multiples, particularly in the case of offshore surveys where the impact of multiple reflections is relatively more pronounced.Conventionally, various interpolation methods based on the Radon transform have been proposed to address the issue of the near- offset data gap. However, these methods have several limitations, leading to the recent emergence of deep-learning (DL)-based approaches as alternatives. In this study, we conducted an in-depth analysis of two representative DL-based studies to scrutinize the challenges that future studies on near-offset interpolation must address. Furthermore, through field data experiments, we precisely analyze the limitations encountered when applying previous DL-based trace interpolation techniques to near-offset situations.

In the second step, the footprints were collected in seven environments with five kinds of shoe models, and a deep learning model was applied to them. In the third step, a preprocess was used in order to improve the accuracy of a model and obtain data in terms of quantity and quality, and then a deep learning model was applied to the data. As a result, the accuracy for the model for the experiment objects was 0.9346. However, a continuous enhancement for our methodology is needed to achieve a high accuracy for more shoe models. Thus, this paper suggested a proposal to enhance the footprint investigation framework that adopted the science technology to specify a suspect by associating the proposed deep learning-based footprint searching scheme with the video from CCTV (closed-circuit television)."

A pipeline of data transformation algorithms was constructed to convert raw S2S prediction data into the training data processed with several statistical distribution. A dimensionality reduction algorithm for selecting features through rankings of correlation coefficients between the observed and the input data. The training model in the study was designed with TimeDistributed wrapper applied to all convolutional layers of U-Net: The TimeDistributed wrapper allows a U-Net convolutional layer to be directly applied to 5-dimensional time series data while maintaining the time axis of data, but every input should be at least 3D in U-Net. We found that Robust and Standard transformation algorithms are most suitable for improving S2S predictions. The dimensionality reduction based on feature selections did not significantly improve predictions of daily precipitation for six climate models and even worsened predictions of daily maximum and minimum temperatures. While deep learning-based postprocessing was also improved MME S2S precipitation predictions, it did not have a significant effect on temperature predictions, particularly for the lead time of weeks 1 and 2. Further research is needed to develop an optimal deep learning model for improving S2S temperature predictions by testing various models and parameters."

One such research area involves performing various audio AI applications using audio data collected from multiple IoT devices in an IoT edge computing environment. However, in most studies, IoT devices only perform sensing data transmission to the edge server, and all processes, including data preprocessing, are performed on the edge server. In this case, it not only leads to overload issues on the edge server but also causes network congestion by transmitting unnecessary data for learning. On the other way, if data preprocessing is delegated to each IoT device to address this issue, it leads to another problem of increased blackout time due to energy shortages in the devices. In this paper, we aim to alleviate the problem of increased blackout time in devices while mitigating issues in server-centric edge AI environments by determining where the data preprocessed based on the energy state of each IoT device. In the proposed method, IoT devices only perform the preprocessing process, which includes sound discrimination and noise removal, and transmit to the server if there is more energy available than the energy threshold required for the basic operation of the device."

The model consists of two primary components: a text detection and background removal model within images, and a font recognition model used within the text. The text detection model was refined through various approaches such as image processing and deep learning to identify the optimal model. For the font recognition model, comparisons were made between CNN and ResNet models to select the most suitable one. As a result, an integrated 2-stage model was constructed.

Osteoporosis is diagnosed by measuring bone density in the total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine. To accurately measure bone density in the lumbar spine, the vertebral region must be segmented from the lumbar X-ray image. Deep learning-based automatic spinal segmentation methods can provide fast and precise infor- mation about the vertebral region. In this study, we used 695 lumbar spine images as training and test datasets for a deep learning segmentation model. We proposed a lumbar automatic segmentation model, CM-Net, which combines the center point of the spine and the modified U-Net network. As a result, the average Dice Similarity Coeffi- cient(DSC) was 0.974, precision was 0.916, recall was 0.906, accuracy was 0.998, and Area under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) was 0.912. This study demonstrates a high-performance automatic segmentation model for lumbar X-ray images, which overcomes noise such as spinal fractures and implants. Furthermore, we can perform accurate measurement of bone density on lumbar X-ray images using an automatic segmentation methodology for the spine, which can prevent the risk of compression fractures at an early stage and improve the accuracy and efficiency of oste- oporosis diagnosis."

In this paper, the OCR system was based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) to train Hangul, English, and Numbers. Subsequently, the process was implemented that distinguishes the complex words to complete Hangul characters, recognizes the complete Hangul characters, and converts them into text data. Additionally, to further improve the accuracy of the OCR system, search the text data in a web search engine, and verify the existence of modified words. If a modified word is found in the web search results, it is considered the correct recognition result and included in the final text data. We conducted a recognition rate measurement and found that the OCR system was able to accurately recognize up to 90.1% of characters in documents containing Hangul, English, and Numbers."

화장품 물체 인식을 위한 Two-Stage 딥러닝 기반 알고리즘,2023,"['Computer Vision', 'Deep Learning', 'Object Detection', 'Classification']",,"With the recent surge in YouTube usage, there has been a proliferation of user-generated videos where individuals evaluate cosmetics. Consequently, many companies are increasingly utilizing evaluation videos for their product marketing and market research. However, a notable drawback is the manual classification of these product review videos incurring significant costs and time. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning-based cosmetics search algorithm to automate this task. The algorithm consists of two networks: One for detecting candidates in images using shape features such as circles, rectangles, etc and Another for filtering and categorizing these candidates. The reason for choosing a Two-Stage architecture over One-Stage is that, in videos containing background scenes, it is more robust to first detect cosmetic candidates before classifying them as specific objects. Although Two-Stage structures are generally known to outperform One-Stage structures in terms of model architecture, this study opts for Two-Stage to address issues related to the acquisition of training and validation data that arise when using One-Stage. Acquiring data for the algorithm that detects cosmetic candidates based on shape and the algorithm that classifies candidates into specific objects is cost-effective, ensuring the overall robustness of the algorithm."

As the size of the domestic and overseas markets grew, the scale andcomplexity of EPC (Engineering, Procurement, Construction) projects increased, and risk management of project management and ITB(Invitation to Bid) documents became a critical issue. The time granted to actual construction companies in the bidding process followingthe EPC project award is not only limited, but also extremely challenging to review all the risk terms in the ITB document due to manpowerand cost issues. Previous research attempted to categorize the risk terms in EPC contract documents and detect them based on AI, butthere were limitations to practical use due to problems related to data, such as the limit of labeled data utilization and class imbalance.Therefore, this study aims to develop an AI model that can categorize the contract terms based on the FIDIC Yellow 2017(FederationInternationale Des Ingenieurs-Conseils Contract terms) standard in detail, rather than defining and classifying risk terms like previousresearch. A multi-text classification function is necessary because the contract terms that need to be reviewed in detail may vary dependingon the scale and type of the project. To enhance the performance of the multi-text classification model, we developed the ELECTRAPLM (Pre-trained Language Model) capable of efficiently learning the context of text data from the pre-training stage, and conducteda four-step experiment to validate the performance of the model. As a result, the ensemble version of the self-developed ITB-ELECTRAmodel and Legal-BERT achieved the best performance with a weighted average F1-Score of 76% in the classification of 57 contract terms."

The commonly used motion analysis devices are limited to measuring two-dimensional plane motion based on images. Therefore, physical quantities such as moments of inertia and rotation are difficult to obtain. Although systems that track, measure, and analyze the motion of objects are used in sports, they are expensive and specific to the field, making it difficult to use them widely in various fields of study. Thus, this research aims to overcome these limitations by developing device that analyzes the movement of objects in various three-dimensional spaces using two vertically positioned cameras, which can be used in a variety of environments with dramatically reduced costs. The proposed device consists of two main steps: the first step is to measure the three-dimensional position of an object with a camera connected to a single-shot multibox detector (SSD) trained with 1,465 image data, and the second step is to calculate the physical quantity and analyze the motion after visualizing the data of the measured object’s position and time in three dimensions. To measure the actual coordinates of the object, the diameter of the object is converted into pixels, and the distance in centimeters per pixel is obtained by utilizing the similarity ratio with the moving object captured by the camera. With the cm/px calculated, the pixel value obtained through camera is converted to cm, the actual coordinate of the object. To verify the accuracy of the proposed data, the acceleration of gravity was measured with the trend line of each parabola. The average error range of the acceleration of gravity calculated was ±0.20 m/s², which demonstrated great accuracy."

Users cannot delete their data and cannot limit the purpose of use. For example, data owners such as medical institutions that want to apply deep learning technology to patients’ medical records cannot share patient data because of privacy and confidentiality issues, making it difficult to benefit from deep learning technology. In this paper, we have designed a privacy preservation technique-applied deep learning technique that allows multiple workers to use a neural network model jointly, without sharing input datasets, in multi-party system. We proposed a method that can selectively share small subsets using an optimization algorithm based on modified stochastic gradient descent, confirming that it could facilitate training with increased learning accuracy while protecting private information."

The study constructed a deep learning model using façade images of buildings located on various local commercial streets in Seoul. In each region, identity is related to individual perceptions and can be described as a collection of images that individuals perceive regarding that region. In many parts of Seoul, local identities have changed, been lost, or have been established during the rapid urbanization process, and related research has been conducted. This study focused on visual elements among the various components that make up these local identities, and utilized deep learning technology to confirm whether each region's identity can be inferred from local visual data alone. With the increased awareness of artificial intelligence, deep learning technology has been expanded and used in various contexts, such as creating images and text, and research on applications such as inference and automation using visual intelligence models has continued in the architectural spatial design field. (Method) This study collected data from various commercial streets in Seoul and built a deep learning model by processing the collected data. The specific processes can be summarized in the following order: 1) acquisition of regional building façade images using the street view function of portal sites, 2) construction of façade datasets through image data preprocessing, 3) utilization and learning of pre-trained CNN-based deep learning models, and 4) a review and discussion of the results from the test image data. (Results) Through the built regional façade image dataset and deep learning model, it was confirmed that images were classified by region only with visual information called façade images of each commercial street. In particular, as a result of learning and testing the model, it was confirmed that façade images in a specific region were classified with high accuracy. This can be presumed to be due to reasons such as policies for commercial streets in the region, such as a clearly lower proportion of franchise stores than in other regions. Thus, it was confirmed that identity can be inferred through the façade image learning model of commercial streets by region using only aesthetic factors. (Conclusions) Existing regional and commercial identity-related studies have defined locality using qualitative methodologies, such as interviews and surveys of local residents and visitors. However, this study is meaningful in that it presented a more time- and cost-effective quantitative approach."

The proposed technique secures the visibility of the outdoor LED displayboard by automatically adjusting the LED luminance according to the weather change using deep learning using animaging device. In order to automatically adjust the LED luminance according to weather changes, a deep learning modelthat can classify the weather is created by learning it using a convolutional network after first going through apreprocessing process for the flattened background part image data. The applied deep learning network reduces thedifference between the input value and the output value using the Residual learning function, inducing learning whiletaking the characteristics of the initial input value. Next, by using a controller that recognizes the weather and adjuststhe luminance of the outdoor LED display board according to the weather change, the luminance is changed so that theluminance increases when the surrounding environment becomes bright, so that it can be seen clearly. In addition, whenthe surrounding environment becomes dark, the visibility is reduced due to scattering of light, so the brightness of theelectronic display board is lowered so that it can be seen clearly.

Thirty-four patients were included, while both deep learning T2-weighted images and conventional T2-weightedimages were acquired in axial and coronal planes. The images were quantitatively evaluated employing Natural Image QualityEvaluator (NIQE) and Neural Image Assessment (NIMA), as well as qualitatively assessed using a Likert 4-point scale. TheNIQE results indicated that the deep learning T2-weighted images had superior image quality compared with the conventionalT2-weighted images. In terms of NIMA results, no statistically significant difference was found in the axial plane betweenthe two image types, but a statistically significant difference was observed in the coronal plane of the deep learning T2-weightedimages. Qualitative evaluation demonstrated qualitative benefits in the oral and pharyngeal regions. The research findingssuggest that the application of deep learning in areas of the face with unconscious movement can provide higher image qualitythan conventional T2-weighted images.

In this study, among the 10 pre-trained Deep Learning Neural Network models used in previous studies, the Neural Network model with the highest accuracy was selected as the optimal model through performance verification, and then it was used to integrate 9 single environments into multiple ones. As a result, by adjusting the hyper-parameter of models below 95% in prediction accuracy, we were able to raise it above the previous percentage. Consequently, we selected the Efficientnet_v2_s model, which had the highest accuracy, to conduct an environment integration experiment. As a result, after running the learning and verifying performance in an environment that integrated all nine single environments, the roof inclination was successfully detected in all environments with an accuracy of 99.84%."

We generated five deep learning models using sequentially input data (VA and OCT B-scan images at baseline and after three loading doses, and treatment regimen). Prediction of VA at 12 months was performed using deep learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural network and multilayer perceptron. The outcomes were dichotomized based on whether the decremental change in VA during the 12 months of treatment was more or less than logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution 0.3. Predictive efficiency was assessed by comparing the performance of deep learning models.Results: The best performing model was trained using input data, including VA at baseline and after three loading doses, treatment regimen, and OCT B-scan images at baseline and after three loading doses.

They cause loss of vegetation and affect ecosystem changes depending on their intensityand occurrence. Ecosystem changes, in turn, affect wildfire occurrence, causing secondary damage. Thus,accurate estimation of the areas affected by wildfires is fundamental. Satellite remote sensing is used forforest fire detection because it can rapidly acquire topographic and meteorological information aboutthe affected area after forest fires. In addition, deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neuralnetworks (CNN) and transformer models show high performance for more accurate monitoring of fireburntregions. To date, the application of deep learning models has been limited, and there is a scarcityof reports providing quantitative performance evaluations for practical field utilization. Hence, this studyemphasizes a comparative analysis, exploring performance enhancements achieved through both modelselection and data design. This study examined deep learning models for detecting wildfire-damagedareas using Landsat 8 satellite images in California. Also, we conducted a comprehensive comparisonand analysis of the detection performance of multiple models, such as U-Net and High-ResolutionNetwork-Object Contextual Representation (HRNet-OCR). Wildfire-related spectral indices such asnormalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized burn ratio (NBR) were used as inputchannels for the deep learning models to reflect the degree of vegetation cover and surface moisturecontent. As a result, the mean intersection over union (mIoU) was 0.831 for U-Net and 0.848 for HRNet-OCR, showing high segmentation performance. The inclusion of spectral indices alongside the base wavelength bands resulted in increased metric values for all combinations, affirming that the augmentationof input data with spectral indices contributes to the refinement of pixels.

Especially,it is more important to predict peak load accurately in winter and summer because peak load is higher than other seasons. If peakload is predicted to be higher than actual peak load, the start-up costs of power plants would increase. It causes economic loss to thecompany. On the other hand, if the peak load is predicted to be lower than the actual peak load, blackout may occur due to a lackof power plants capable of generating electricity. Economic losses and blackouts can be prevented by minimizing the prediction errorof the peak load.

However, capturing a large field of view often requires specialized transducers which have limitations for specific clinical scenarios. Panoramic imaging offers an alternative approach by sequentially aligning image sections acquired from freehand sweeps using a standard transducer.

Method: Each rule was designed to detect the falling of a maintenance worker by using the inference results from pre-trained YOLOv5 and OpenPose models, respectively. The rules were then integrally applied to detect worker falls within the utility tunnel. Result: Although the worker presence and falling were detected by the proposed model, the inference results were dependent on both the distance between the worker and CCTV and the falling direction of the worker. Additionally, the falling detection system using YOLOv5 shows superior performance, due to its lower dependence on distance and fall direction, compared to the OpenPose-based. Consequently, results from the fall detection using the integrated dual deep learning model were dependent on the YOLOv5 detection performance. Conclusion: The proposed hybrid model shows detecting an abnormal worker in the utility tunnel but the improvement of the model was meaningless compared to the single model based YOLOv5 due to severe differences in detection performance between each deep learning model"

To predict the yield of cabbage and radish in Gangwon-do from 2015 to 2020, satellite images from June to September, the growing period of cabbage and radish, were used. Normalized difference vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, lead area index, and land surface temperature were employed in this study as input data for the yield model. Crop yields can be effectively predicted using satellite images because satellites collect continuous spatiotemporal data on the global environment. Based on the model developed previous study, a model designed for input data was proposed in this study. Using time series satellite images, convolutional neural network, a deep learning model, was used to predict crop yield. Landsat 8 provides images every 16 days, but it is difficult to acquire images especially in summer due to the influence of weather such as clouds. As a result, yield prediction was conducted by splitting June to July into one part and August to September into two. Yield prediction was performed using a machine learning approach and reference models , and modeling performance was compared. The model’s performance and early predictability were assessed using year-by-year cross-validation and early prediction. The findings of this study could be applied as basic studies to predict the yield of field crops in Korea."

Additionally, the study investigates the extent to which deep learning techniques, which consider nonlinearities, can enhance the forecasting performance. The empirical analysis uses monthly average data from January 2010 to December 2022 to forecast the 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month exchange rate changes. The main findings are threefold. First, the RNS model tends to suffer from the overfitting, while the reduced RNS model, including a relative curvature factor that reflects cross-country differences in monetary policy stance and unexpected changes in future short-term interest rates, demonstrates a relatively lower RMSE. Second, although no statistically significant model differences were found for the one-month forecast, the forecasting performance for the remaining forecast horizons was improved by deep learning techniques. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to cross-country differences in curvature factors when predicting KRWUSD exchange rate changes in the medium to long term and to use deep learning techniques to further improve the forecasting performance."

To reduce this mortality rate, farmers need to carefully observe the piglets to prevent accidents such as being crushed and to maintain a proper body temperature. However, observing a large number of pigs individually can be challenging for farmers. Therefore, our aim was to detect the behavior of piglets and sows in real-time using deep learning models, such as YOLOv4-CSP and YOLOv7-E6E, that allow for real-time object detection. YOLOv4-CSP reduces computational cost by partitioning feature maps and utilizing Cross-stage Hierarchy to remove redundant gradient calculation. YOLOv7-E6E analyzes and controls gradient paths such that the weights of each layer learn diverse features. We detected standing, sitting, and lying behaviors in sows and lactating and starving behaviors in piglets, which indicate nursing behavior and movement to colder areas away from the group. We optimized the model parameters for the best object detection and improved reliability by acquiring data through experts. We conducted object detection for the five different behaviors. The YOLOv4-CSP model achieved an accuracy of 0.63 and mAP of 0.662, whereas the YOLOv7-E6E model showed an accuracy of 0.65 and mAP of 0.637. Therefore, based on mAP, which includes both class and localization performance, YOLOv4-CSP showed the superior performance. Such research is anticipated to be effectively utilized for the behavioral analysis of fattening pigs and in preventing piglet crushing in the future."

Object detection algorithms are largely divided into one-stage model and two-stage model. In real-time detection, the two-stage model is not suitable for being too slow. One-stage models also had problems with accuracy, but they have improved performance through version upgrades. Among them, YOLO-V5 improved small image object detection performance through Mosaic.

However, previous studies have been limited by a lack of understanding of potholes. Furthermore, the need for research is growing as the number of risk factors that can cause potholes is rapidly increasing. To overcome the limitations of previous studies, this study proposes an image preprocessing technique that can effectively reflect the characteristics of potholes and an optimal structure for pothole detection based on EfficientDet. The proposed preprocessing technique combines two algorithms, CLAHE and Sobel Edge detection, to identify and learn potholes in road surface images by maximizing the boundaries of potholes through contour detection and contrast thresholding for the entire image, rather than solely relying on contrast. In addition, we designed the optimal number of BiFPN layers for the pothole dataset so that the module can clearly detect potholes.

To prevent this, traffic signs are often used to alert drivers by indicating the height of vehicles that can enter the area.

Therefore, a device that automatically generates information about these height restrictions is needed, which can be obtained automatically by automatically classifying vehicle information.

Since babies mainly express their status through the pattern of crying sounds, research to classify the baby's status through voice is being actively conducted. Most of the studies that classify the baby's condition identified the baby's condition with a clean baby voice without noise.However, the baby's voice data collected in the real environment is likely to contain noise inside. Therefore, it is necessary to process the noise in the voice data. This paper proposes MCycle GAN (Multiple Cycle Generative Adversarial Net), which is a cycle GAN-based deep learning model for noise processing. MCycle GAN is a model in which multiple cycles are arranged in the existing Cycle GAN for more precise noise processing. The discrimination performance of the discriminator is improved by learning the adversarial relationship between a large number of generators and a small number of discriminators, and the generator needs to generate more precise forged data to deceive the discriminator. As a result of the experiment, the MCycle GAN model takes more training time than Cycle, but it showed stronger discriminant discrimination performance and generator forged data generation performance. However, when there are too many cycles, a small performance improvement can be seen compared to the increased learning time."

However, due to abnormal climates around the world, it is becoming increasingly challenging to estimate the rice heading date. Therefore, a more objective classification method for estimating the rice heading date is needed than the existing methods. This study, we aimed to classify the rice heading stage from various images using a CNN classification model. We collected top-view images taken from a drone and a phenotyping tower, as well as slanted-view images captured with a RGB camera. The collected images underwent preprocessing to prepare them as input data for the CNN model. The CNN architectures employed were ResNet50, InceptionV3, and VGG19, which are commonly used in image classification models. The accuracy of the models all showed an accuracy of 0.98 or higher regardless of each architecture and type of image. We also used Grad-CAM to visually check which features of the image the model looked at and classified. Then verified our model accurately measure the rice heading date in paddy fields. The rice heading date was estimated to be approximately one day apart on average in the four paddy fields. This method suggests that the water head can be estimated automatically and quantitatively when estimating the rice heading date from various paddy field monitoring images."

Lung cancer often has no early symptoms, so patients often miss the time of treatment. Accordingly, in Korea, lung cancer has been included in the national cancer screening since 2019. However, among misdiagnosis cases, lung cancer had the highest misdiagnosis rate, and the accuracy of screening may vary depending on the medical specialist's skill level and fatigue. Accordingly, this paper proposed a lung cancer CADx(Computer-Aided Diagnosis) system based on EfficientNetV2-L and ConvNeXt-B. EfficientNetV2 is a model that can have high classification performance with a small number of parameters using the Training-Aware NAS (Neural Architecture Search) method. ConvNeXt is a network that achieves higher performance than ViT(Vision Transformer) by combining the latest techniques with ResNet-50 as a base model. Medical imaging generally suffers from a data shortage problem. Therefore, we augmented the lung cancer dataset using AutoAugment using the ImageNet augmentation policy. Through this method, the sensitivity in classifying malignant(lung cancer) and normal improved from 0.8354 to 0.9638 in EfficientNetV2 and from 0.9796 to 0.9963 in ConvNeXt.AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) also improved from 0.9967 to 0.9974 for EfficientNetV2 and from 0.9973 to 1.0000 for ConvNeXt.

However, the existing methods still require improvements in suppression performance and efficiency. Various studies on the suppression of ground roll in seismic data have recently been conducted using deep learning methods developed for image processing.

Common shot gathers from the same field were divided into training and test datasets to compare the algorithms. We trained the models using the training data and evaluated their performances using the test data. When training these models with field data, ground roll removed data are required; therefore, the ground roll is suppressed by f-k filtering and used as the ground-truth data. To evaluate the performance of the deep learning models and compare the training results, we utilized quantitative indicators such as the correlation coefficient and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) based on the similarity to the ground-truth data. The DnCNN model exhibited the best performance, and we confirmed that other models could also be applied to suppress the ground roll."

In this study, the lock-in thermography technique among digital infrared thermography technique was used to detect circular defects existing on the back side of metal specimens. Generally, a halogen lamp is used as an external heat source device, which has the problem of not providing uniform heat. To address this problem, the uniformity of the heat pattern was ensured by applying Gaussian filtering to fast Fourier transform. In addition, a very-deep super-resolution algorithm among deep learning techniques was applied to improve the resolution of noisy images. It was confirmed that SNR was improved in VDSR images. In addition, 11 detection rates were confirmed at 0.02 Hz, and a tendency for the detection rate to decrease as the frequency increased was confirmed.

Each year, around 1,000 public agencies carry out satisfaction surveys. Nevertheless, the reliance on standardized surveys for comparability restricts the gathering of nuanced information. In response, subjective questions have been introduced. Yet, the examination of these questions remains fragmented and hasn't been integrated into mainline satisfaction surveys. To address this gap, we evaluated feedback from roughly 1,500 participants associated with K-Public Agency. For handling these subjective questions, we leveraged the RoBERTa algorithm and employed a range of models, such as XGBoost, neural networks, and logistic regression. Preliminary findings underscore the effectiveness of XGBoost when dealing with structured data. Notably, its performance showed variations when considering subjective inputs. A significant finding was that integrating subjective questions enhanced both the accuracy and recall in predicting satisfaction levels.

허락되지 않은 면죄부: 영화 <치욕의 대지(Mudbound)> 깊이 보기,2023,"['mudbound', 'Separate-but-Equal', 'Ku Klux Klan', 'Continuity', 'Locality', '치욕의 대지', '인종분리정책', '큐클러스클랜', '지속성', '지역성']","본 연구는 미국에서 인종혐오와 관련 범죄가 급속도로 증가하기 시작한 시기에 개봉한 영화 <치욕의 대지(mudbound)>에 주목한다. 본고가 이 영화에 주목하는 이유는 이 영화를 통해 클랜의 지속성을 확인할 수 있기 때문이다. 일반적으로 학계에서 클랜에 대한 연구는 1기부터 4기 혹은 첫 번째 클랜부터 네 번째 클랜까지로 그 역사적 시기를 도식적으로 나누어 클랜의 성장과 쇠퇴를 분절적으로 다뤄왔다. 도식적으로 정리하자면, 1기 클랜은 1865년을 시작으로 1871년 클랜법으로 사라졌다가 1915년을 기점으로 2기 클랜이 부활했고 1944년 탈세 문제로 다시 해산되었다가 1960년대 민권운동의 반작용으로 3기 클랜이 재등장했다. 이후 1965년 존슨 (Lyndon B. Johnson) 대통령의 강경 대응으로 소멸되었으나 1970년대 말 경제적 불안으로 마지막 4기가 재부활했다는 것이다. 그러나, 미국에서 인종갈등과 혐오의 역사가 세대를 이어 대물림되며 지속되어 온 것과 마찬가지로 클랜의 활동 또한 한 번도 소멸되거나 사라진 적이 없다. 특히 클랜의 역사 중 전국적으로 가장 오랜 기간 전성기를 누렸다고 평가되는 2기 클랜은 1944년 해산되었다고 알려져 있다. 그러나 전국적 조직은 와해 되었을지 모르나 지역의 클랜맨(Clan-man)들의 활동은 2차 세계대전이 종결된 이후에도 개별 주, 카운티, 그리고 타운에서 그 기세를 굳건하게 지키고 있었다. 영화 <치욕의 대지>는 바로 이 시기 어떻게 잔인한 인종폭력이 지역에서 계속 자행되었는가를 증명해 보인다. 다시 말해 이 영화는 클랜의 지속성이 클랜의 본질인 지역성에 근거하고 있음을 보여주는 하나의 충분한 레퍼런스라 할 수 있다. 이에 본고는 영화 <치욕의 대지>를 통해 클랜의 지역성 혹은 지역문화가 어떻게 작동했으며 어떤 근거와 논리로 인종폭력을 정당화할 수 있었는지 그 행태를 클랜의 긴 역사성 속에서 재고해보고자 한다.","This study focuses on the movie <Mudbound>, which was released at a time when racial hatred and related crimes began to rapidly increase in the United States. The reason this paper focuses on this film is because the continuity of the Clan can be confirmed through this film. In general, research on clans in academia has dealt with the growth and decline of clans in a segmental manner by schematically dividing the historical period from the 1st to the 4th period, or from the first clan to the fourth clan. To summarize schematically, the first clan started in 1865 and disappeared under the Clan Act of 1871, and the second clan was revived starting in 1915. It was disbanded again in 1944 due to tax evasion issues, and was reorganized into the third clan as a reaction to the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Afterwards, it was extinguished in 1965 due to President Lyndon B. Johnson's hard-line response, but the last firth clan was revived due to economic instability in the late 1970s. However, just as the history of racial conflict and hatred in the United States has been passed down from generation to generation, the clan's activities have never been extinguished or disappeared. In particular, the second clan, which is considered to have enjoyed its heyday for the longest period of time nationwide in the clan's history, is known to have been disbanded in 1944. But while the national organization may have disintegrated, the activities of local clan-men continued to hold strong in individual states, counties, and towns even after the end of World War II. The film <Mudbound> proves how brutal racial violence continued to occur in the region during this period. In other words, this film can be said to be a sufficient reference to show that the continuity of the clan is based on locality, which is, in fact, the essence of the clan. Accordingly, through the movie <Mudbound>, this paper seeks to reexamine how the locality or local culture of the clan worked and on what basis and logic racial violence could be justified within the clan's long history."

As for the analysis method, after embedding was performed using the DINO-ViT16 model among vision transformer models, principal component analysis was performed for dimension reduction.Afterwards, the k-means algorithm was applied to cluster the game types, and at this time, the silhouette index was used to select the optimal number of clusters. The results of this study are as follows. First, the game type of soccer was classified into two clusters, and as a result of comparing the game records of each cluster, it was found that the number of passes and ball occupancy of cluster 2 was higher than that of cluster 1. Cluster 1 is the direct type, and cluster 2 is the build-up type. Second, as a result of detailed cluster analysis on cluster 1, it was classified into two clusters. As a result of comparing game records and heat maps for each cluster, cluster 1-1 was a defense-oriented unified attack pattern type, and cluster 1-2 was a defense-oriented various attack pattern. Third, as a result of detailed cluster analysis on cluster 2, it was classified into 3 clusters, and as a result of comparing the match records and heat maps for each cluster, it is determined that cluster 2-1 was a type with various attack patterns through high ball occupancy in the central area, cluster 2-2 is a type that dominates the game with very high ball occupancy and passes, and cluster 2-3 is a type that has a pattern of attack focused on a space behind the defense through high ball occupancy or a specific area."

Accordingly, this research analyzed game strategies using game data, identified user behavior patterns, and conducted analysis using multi-layer perceptron to analyze user behavior patterns. In addition, Game engine commonalities can be the reason that there exists no single game engine capable of being used across all the different game genres. Such an engine design could provide a number of benefits to the game development community. Development time and cost can be significantly reduced, and programmers and designers can more easily be transfered between different projects. They are convinced that general game engine components can be found by analysing game engines across different genres, but they also consider the possibility that this could exclude essential parts, making it less applicable and relevant when making games."

In particular, the long short term memory(LSTM) algorithm and the gated recurrent unit(GRU) algorithm, which are one of the neural network analyses, are used and an autoregressive mixed data sampling model is added to explain the structure of each factor. And the TF-IDF methodology is used to quantify economics news which is unstructured data. As a result of the analysis, LSTM is superior in terms of predictive power, but it has a disadvantage that it is difficult to understand the factors because they are treated as a black box. By the way, as a result of estimating by the AR-MIDAS method, it is found that as the industrial production index at t increases and the unemployment rate decreases at t-1, the gross domestic product at t improves. It is also found that economic news in the first month of the quarter had a negative impact on the economy, while economic news in the second month had a positive impact on quarterly GDP.

In contrast, OC-SORT is used for object tracking, continuously tracking each Hanwoo to provide stable tracking results. The result analysis module then parses this data, providing real-time and comprehensive information about Hanwoo behavior and health to ranch managers for precise management decisions.

These algorithms aim to generate real-time trajectories while considering obstacle avoidance. Recent advancements have shown promising results in generating safe and efficient trajectories in complex dynamic environments, such as forests, as well as controlling multiple drones simultaneously. However, most existing drone trajectory generation algorithms impose limitations on the maximum speed and acceleration parameters to ensure drone stability. These restrictions on speed-related parameters hinder the efficiency and practicality of drones. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called “Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Active Parameter Control Algorithm” that addresses this limitation. This algorithm dynamically sets the maximum speed and acceleration parameters of a drone based on the real-time environment using a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework. The upper layer agent in the hierarchy is responsible for adjusting the maximum speed and acceleration parameters considering the current environmental conditions. The lower layer agent then utilizes these parameters to generate a real-time trajectory. Notably, this approach can be applied to all drone trajectory generation algorithms that involve setting maximum speed and maximum acceleration. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that applying the proposed algorithm to drone trajectory generation algorithms results in superior performance in terms of speed, path length, and path smoothness. These improvements showcase the potential of our approach in enhancing the efficiency and overall capabilities of drones operating in complex and dynamic environments."

The posthumanist approach that has recently moved into the mainstream is also increasingly influencing the understanding of lifelong learning. The posthumanist approach's 'more-than-human' perspective aligns with the attempt to understand human learning from an object-oriented and flat ontological standpoint. Posthumanism redefines ontology, offering a different perspective from the previous anthropocentric worldview, that is, the modernist worldview. In this transitional phase, we aim to address three meaningful questions:. 1. Why is it important to understand lifelong learning from the perspective of the posthumanist approach? 2. How does this shift in perspective capture the phenomenological reality of lifelong learning? 3. What new dimension does this approach uncover? The posthumanist approach has liberated lifelong learning from the constraints of educational 'essentialism'. In early models of lifelong learning research, humans were depicted as subjective beings, yet they were often confined to reproducing a predetermined world and essence. Although humans have been portrayed as self-directed learners, the actual learning process has always been tied to curriculums, competencies, and fixed outcomes. A truly Copernican shift in learning starts with relocating lifelong learning to an object-oriented perspective. Post-humanism rejects human pretentious subjectivity and reduces the burden of knowledge imposed upon them by the world. The traditional subject-centered learning theory was reinterpreted as object-oriented in this paper.The essence of the post-lifelong learning concept we are discussing is to move away from understanding learning as the accumulation of individual knowledge by Cartesian individuals. Instead, it is about viewing learning in terms of 'extension performed by activity systems'. In this paper, the researchers, first, redefined the concept of learning within the context of the 'more-than-human' dimension. Second, the learning process was redefined as an activity within a learning system that transcends the object-centeredness of learning and encompasses a systematic level including human-material-desire-movement. Third, the learning system was conceptualized based on the idea of assemblage or assemblage ontology. The combination and movement within the system are described as a process of 'becoming' that emerges from and is produced within the system's elements.

In this study, seven types of AI learning data using broadcasting videos released by the Korea Intelligence Information Society Agency (NIA) on AI Hub were analyzed in terms of design and sought standardization measures, especially focusing on classes. As of October 2022, AI Hub has established and released seven types of AI learning data worth a total of 10,895 hours using videos from nine broadcasters, including KBS, MBN, EBS, SBS, Maeil Economy TV, YTN, OBS, tvN, and Maeil Bussiness Newspaper. The size of the learning data construction is close to 132.88 million, including 129,514,816 objects (based on bounding boxes), 124,521 behaviors (based on clips), 3,136,345 situations (based on clips), 22,099 people (based on bounding boxes and key points), and 60,000 shots (based on key shots). In this study, various tasks were organized into objects, actions, and situations, and the format and class of source data and annotation data were standardized. Object and behavior classes into 3-level categorization, and then standardized their names. The situation was viewed as a combination of objects, actions, times, places, content, and emotions, and standardized by detailed units. Accordingly, we derived standardized classes of 28/212/1338 objects, 18/56/353 behaviors, 8/55 emotions, 8/55 content, 2/10 hours, and 25/92 places. According to the standardization results, there were 477 object classes with more than 4,000 bounding boxes and 41 behavioral classes with more than 300 clips. The standardization of AI hub broadcast video datasets can be useful to develop an integrated broadcasting database, to manage datasets efficiently.

In the case of data that reflect the real world, imbalance data may occur depending on the frequency of occurrence of events or the difficulty of collection. Data with an inconsistent number of classes that make up the data are called imbalance data, and in particular, it is difficult to learn the minority classes with relatively little data through Deep Learning algorithms. Recently, Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) have been applied as a method for data augmentation, and self-supervised learning-based pre-learning has been proposed for minority class learning. However, because class information of imbalance data is utilized in the process of learning the Generative Model, the quality of generated data is poor due to poor learning of minority classes. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a similarity-based exhaustive contrast learning method. The proposed method is quantitatively evaluated through the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score (IS).

When an avocado image is input, the model classifies the ripeness of the avocado with an accuracy of over 99%, and proposes a dataset and algorithm that can reduce manpower and increase accuracy in avocado production and distribution households."

A previous study applied active learning tech- niques to practically improve the performance of cross-project defect prediction, but it used a traditional machine learning model that used hand-made features as input for active learning target selection and defect prediction, therefore feature extraction was expensive and performance was limited. In addition, the problem of performance deviation according to the selection of the input project remained. In this study, the following methods were proposed to overcome these limitations. First, we used a deep learning model that can use the source code as an input to lower the model building cost and improve prediction performance. Second, a Bayesian convolutional neural network is applied to select an active learning target using a deep learning model. Third, instead of considering a single source project, we applied a method that automatically extracts a training data set from multiple projects. Applying the system proposed in this study to 7 open source projects improved the average prediction performance by 13.58% compared to the previous latest research."

Consequently, deep learning-based crop disease diagnosis research utilizing multimodal data has become important. This study proposes a crop disease diagnosis method using multimodal supervised contrastive learning by expanding upon the multimodal self-supervised learning. RandAugment method was used to augment crop image and time series of environment data. These augmented data passed through encoder and projection head for each modality, yielding low-dimensional features. Subsequently, the proposed multimodal supervised contrastive loss helped features from the same class get closer while pushing apart those from different classes. Following this, the pretrained model was fine-tuned for crop disease diagnosis. The visualization of t-SNE result and comparative assessments of crop disease diagnosis performance substantiate that the proposed method has superior performance than multimodal self-supervised learning."

A delayed control force compared to the target control force is applied to the system due to the dynamic characteristics of an actuator, such as a pneumatic spring. Reinforcement learning is a learning method that finds better behavior by learning by itself according to a reward function that is directly related to the learning goal without using a complex mathematical model for the system. Since the accelerometer is the most commonly used sensor in vibration measurement, we proposed a suitable learning excitation force and compensation function based on the acceleration data. The final learned policy was used to simulate the superior performance of the control force for various external forces. It was found from the numerical simulation that the vibration control based on the DDPG and reinforced learning is effective in suppressing vibrations."

The issue is whether one can be exempted from copyright infringement.In this regard, Korean scholar’s attitude starts from the optimistic perspective that U.S. courts will view AI TDM or AI machine learning as fair use based on the fair use principle.Nevertheless, there is no direct basis for the claim that US courts will exempt AI TDM or AI machine learning from fair use. This is because there has been no case in the United States where a court has recognized fair use by clearly targeting AI TDM or AI machine learning. Meanwhile, The Internet Archive case and the Andy Warhol case are hesitant to expand the fair use principle and are giving rise to pessimistic views on whether the use of other people’s copyrighted works in the AI TDM or AI machine learning process will be considered fair use.Taking that into consideration, American scholars are also developing the argument that the use of copyrighted works for AI machine learning or AI TDM should be considered fair use.Therefore, the positive stance on the possibility of TDM exemption under Article 35-5 of the Korean Copyright Act needs to be carefully reexamined."

This causes a very long time consumption, and a transfer learning-based PINN(Physics-Informed Neural Network) is proposed to solve this problem.

In order to proactive identify students at risk of dropout, this study built a decision tree, random forest, logistic regression, and deep learning-based dropout prediction model using academic data that can be easily obtained from each university’s academic management system. Their performances were subsequently analyzed and compared. The analysis revealed that while the logistic regression-based prediction model exhibited the highest recall rate, its f-1 value and ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under the Curve) value were comparatively lower. On the other hand, the random forest-based prediction model demonstrated superior performance across all other metrics except recall value. In addition, in order to assess model performance over distinct prediction periods, we divided these periods into short-term (within one semester), medium-term (within two semesters), and long-term (within three semesters). The results underscored that the long-term prediction yielded the highest predictive efficacy.

This study examines apartment asking prices and sales volume effect on transaction prices from May 2022 to July 2023, capturing both market downturns and upswings. Using linear regression and a deep learning-based DNN model, we analyzed data from large Seoul apartment complexes with over 3,000 units. Key variables included real estate prices, transaction volume, interest rates, and property features. The findings showed that larger gaps between the lowest transaction and asking prices, and increased sales volume, led to bigger price swings. The DNN model's predictive accuracy was verified, with asking prices and inventory as its primary drivers. This suggests asking prices and sales volume will be refined as key market analysis tools in evolving real estate policies."

In this paper, we propose a development environment for RL-based controllers in real-world systems by integrating MATLAB/Simulink, Python, and the LW-RCP (Light-weight Rapid Control Prototyping) system developed by the authors’ laboratory. The proposed development environment utilizes LW-RCP’s library block in a Simulink-based RL controller model, enabling real-time experiments on real-world systems, and stores state information data in MATLAB’s workspace. Python obtains this data through the Python API after each episode and uses it to iteratively enhance the RL agent’s policy by using RL algorithms. Updated parameter values for the agent’s policy neural network are then sent back to MATLAB's workspace, enabling convenient updates to the deep neural network-based policy controller block in Simulink. This development environment greatly reduces the time and trial and error in configuring real-time system controllers by providing LW-RCP with all necessary functions. Moreover, the efficient data acquisition and integration between MATLAB and Python workspaces facilitate the learning process and reflection of results in Simulink-based controllers. We demonstrate the effectiveness and convenience of the proposed environment through its successful application to the swing-up control problem of a single inverted pendulum."

Recently HRI a convergence technology for natural communication between humans and robots and smooth interaction are attracting attention. HRI research can be divided into user-centered and robot-centered interactions. The robot-vision technology recognizes the environment and objects, recognizes a human face to identify a target, recognizes emotions and plays the role of a recognition unit that can infer intentions based on motion. Robots are now so widespread that humans consider them to be their colleagues and friends. Therefore, there is a need for a small robot incorporating object recognition technology.

The proposed system applies robot vision technology that can replace the visual functions of low-spec small humanoid robots and allows the humanoid robot to perform pre-programmed motions through face recognition."

To clarify this, I first look at how the meritocracy frame accelerates self-directed learning in the online era and strengthens the idea of privatization of learning. In particular, the choice of learning contributes to developing student autonomy, but if an educational intervention is lacking in this option, the legitimacy of the attitude of self-control and attention by teachers in the classroom may be undermined. Therefore, I would like to suggest that the possibility of developing “deep attention” in a classroom where this justification has disappeared has gradually decreased, and that this change in attention has caused me to lose “educational time” and cultural time to others in a classroom where I belong. Thus, time and place to develop common sense has been lost."

Accordingly, attempts to create business insights using user evaluation data have been actively made. However, since user evaluation can change after the user experiences the product, it is difficult to say that the analysis based only on reviews immediately after purchase fully reflects the user's evaluation of the product. Moreover, studies conducted so far on user evaluation have overlooked the fact that the length of time a user has used a product can affect the user's product evaluation. Therefore, in this study, we build a model that predicts the direction of change in the user's rating after use from the user's rating and reviews immediately after purchase. In particular, the proposed model reflects the product's period of use in predicting the change direction of the star rating. However, since the posterior information on the duration of product use cannot be used as input in the inference process, we propose a structure that utilizes information about the product's period of use using an auxiliary classifier.

Thestrategies presented include the subject of questioning-learnerquestioning and the issue of the placement of “winged questions.”In the process of asking questions, it is crucial that learnersexperience cognitive confusion; otherwise their ability to generatequestions is blocked. Therefore, even though learner-generatedquestions might indicate incomplete learning, they lead to meaningfullearning by stimulating knowledge and thinking, prompting learners tofind their own answers through self-directed reading. “Wingedquestions” enhance the effect of learner questions by being placed onthe text page next to the point to which they pertain. Through suchpositioning, the “wings” encourage learners to read thoroughly from thefirst page to the last, moving beyond quick glances, skipping, andskim-reading through paging or scrolling. They guide learners todevelop complete questions, which at this point, whether spoken or written, become linguistically structured. As a result, learners’ ability toexpress questions is strengthened.The digital age is seeing vast changes in reading materials andmethods. Instead of focusing solely on solving problems and findingcorrect answers, the ability to generate questions that explore the“why” behind things is becoming more important, fostering active,self-directed learners who can grow into lifelong readers and thinkers."

However, obtaining substantial high-quality labeled data to enhance the performance of deep learning models entails economic and temporal constraints. As a solution for this problem, semi-supervised learning, using a limited amount of labeled data, has been gaining traction. This study assesses the effectiveness of semi-supervised learning in the defect detection process of manufacturing using the MixMatch algorithm. The MixMatch algorithm incorporates three dominant paradigms in the semi-supervised field: Consistency regularization, Entropy minimization, and Generic regularization. The performance of semi-supervised learning based on the MixMatch algorithm was compared with that of supervised learning using defect image data from the metal casting process. For the experiments, the ratio of labeled data was adjusted to 5%, 10%, 25%, and 50% of the total data. At a labeled data ratio of 5%, semi-supervised learning achieved a classification accuracy of 90.19%, outperforming supervised learning by approximately 22%p. At a 10% ratio, it surpassed supervised learning by around 8%p, achieving a 92.89% accuracy. These results demonstrate that semi-supervised learning can achieve significant outcomes even with a very limited amount of labeled data, suggesting its invaluable application in real-world research and industrial settings where labeled data is limited."

In particular, hybrid cloud technology is attracting attention as an efficient artificial intelligence (AI) learning method. However, concerns have arisen regarding the severity of security and server overload issues caused by data movement in traditional centralized AI learning methods. To address these challenges, various distributed learning methods have been studied, and a federated learning algorithm capable of generating high-performance models without data sharing has been proposed.

In this unparalleled methodology, each individual client takes the initiative to train their respective model using their local data. Once this training phase reaches its conclusion, these clients dispatch their model updates to the central server, ensuring a collaborative learning process. This federated approach becomes especially crucial and salient in specific environments, notably the medical sector. In such domains, data frequently deviates from the standard assumption of being independently and identically distributed, presenting unique challenges. Consequently, the academic and industrial worlds are witnessing a burgeoning interest in delving deep into diverse techniques. These techniques range from clustering and personalization to the more avant-garde concept of meta-learning. It's worth noting that a substantial chunk of the existing body of research firmly anchors itself in a framework that places an implicit, and sometimes unwarranted, trust in the central server. Such an over-reliance inadvertently opens the door to potential security vulnerabilities and introduces efficiency bottlenecks, primarily due to the overwhelming server-centric operations. Based on these issues, this study proposes a new federated learning strategy that reduces the load on the central server while leveraging the strengths of clustering methodologies."

The DCT coefficients presented by CAT-Net are combined with the JPEG artifact learning module and the backbone model as pre-learning, and the weights are fixed. The dataset used for pre-training is not included in the public dataset, and the backbone model has a relatively large number of network parameters, which causes overfitting in a small dataset, hindering generalization performance. In this paper, this learning module is designed to learn the characterization depending on the DCT domain in real-time during network training without pre-training. The DCT RRU-Net proposed in this paper is a network that combines RRU-Net which detects forgery by learning only images and JPEG artifact learning module. It is confirmed that the network parameters are less than those of CAT-Net, the detection performance of forgery is better than that of RRU-Net, and the generalization performance for various datasets improves through the network architecture and training method of DCT RRU-Net."

This problem is not only for discriminative models, but also for generative models, such as GAN. The Generative Replay method, which is frequently used in GAN continual learning, uses images generated by GAN provided in the previous task together for learning new tasks, but does not generate good images for CIFAR10, which is a relatively challenging task. Therefore, we can consider a rehearsal-based method that stores a portion of the real data, which cannot store a huge amount of images in limited memory because of large dimension of the real image. In this paper, we propose LactoGAN and LactoGAN+, continual learning methods that store latent vectors that are the inputs of GANs rather than storing real images, as the existing rehearsal-based approaches. As a result, more image knowledge can be stored in the same memory; thus, showing better results than the existing GAN continual learning methods."

ADLFM은 아이템의 특징을 설명하는 텍스트인 아이템 설명(Item Description)을 입력으로 받아 사용자와 아이템의 잠재 벡터를 구하고 어텐션 스코어(Attention Score)를 활용하여 개인의 다양성을 반영할 수 있는 방법을 제시한다. 하지만 아이템 설명을 포함하는 데이터 셋을 요구 하기 때문에 이 방법을 적용할 수 있는 대상이 많지 않은 즉 일반화에 있어 한계가 있다. 본 연구에서는 아이템 설명 대신 추천시스템에서 보편적으로 사용하는 아이템 ID를 입력으로 하고 Self-Attention, Multi-head attention, Multi-Conv1d 등보다 개선된 딥러닝 모델 구조를 적용함으로써 ADLFM의 한계를 개선할 수 있는 일반화된 적응 심층 잠재요인 추천모형 G-ADLFRM을 제안한다.다양한 도메인의 데이터셋을 가지고 입력과 모델 구조 변경에 대한 실험을 진행한 결과, 입력만 변경했을 경우 동반되는 정보손실로 인해 ADLFM 대비 MAE(Mean Absolute Error)가 소폭 높아지며 추천성능이 하락했지만, 처리할 정보량이 적어지면서 epoch 당 평균 학습속도는 대폭 향상되었다. 입력 뿐만 아니라 모델 구조까지 바꿨을 경우에는 가장 성능이 우수한 Multi-Conv1d 구조가 ADLFM과 유사한 성능을 나타내며 입력변경으로 인한 정보손실을 충분히 상쇄시킬 수 있음을 보여주었다. 결론적으로 본 논문에서 제시한 모형은 기존 ADLFM의 성능은 최대한 유지하면서 빠른 학습과 추론이 가능하고(경량화) 다양한 도메인에 적용할 수 있는(일반화) 새로운 모형임을 알 수 있다.","Collaborative Filtering, a representative recommendation system methodology, consists of two approaches: neighbor methods and latent factor models. Among these, the latent factor model using matrix factorization decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into two lower-dimensional rectangular matrices, predicting the item's rating through the product of these matrices. Due to the factor vectors inferred from rating patterns capturing user and item characteristics, this method is superior in scalability, accuracy, and flexibility compared to neighbor-based methods. However, it has a fundamental drawback: the need to reflect the diversity of preferences of different individuals for items with no ratings. This limitation leads to repetitive and inaccurate recommendations. The Adaptive Deep Latent Factor Model (ADLFM) was developed to address this issue. This model adaptively learns the preferences for each item by using the item description, which provides a detailed summary and explanation of the item. ADLFM takes in item description as input, calculates latent vectors of the user and item, and presents a method that can reflect personal diversity using an attention score. However, due to the requirement of a dataset that includes item descriptions, the domain that can apply ADLFM is limited, resulting in generalization limitations. This study proposes a Generalized Adaptive Deep Latent Factor Recommendation Model, G-ADLFRM, to improve the limitations of ADLFM. Firstly, we use item ID, commonly used in recommendation systems, as input instead of the item description. Additionally, we apply improved deep learning model structures such as Self-Attention, Multi-head Attention, and Multi-Conv1D. We conducted experiments on various datasets with input and model structure changes. The results showed that when only the input was changed, MAE increased slightly compared to ADLFM due to accompanying information loss, resulting in decreased recommendation performance. However, the average learning speed per epoch significantly improved as the amount of information to be processed decreased. When both the input and the model structure were changed, the best-performing Multi-Conv1d structure showed similar performance to ADLFM, sufficiently counteracting the information loss caused by the input change. We conclude that G-ADLFRM is a new, lightweight, and generalizable model that maintains the performance of the existing ADLFM while enabling fast learning and inference."

The air quality diagnosis and evaluation system is based on the photochemical numerical model, CMAQ (Community multiscale air quality modeling system), and includes a 3-day forecast at the end of the model’s calculation. The photochemical numerical model basically has limitations because of the uncertainty of input data and simplification of physical and chemical processes. To overcome these limitations, this study applied DNN (Deep Neural Network), a deep learning technique, to the results of the numerical model. As a result of applying DNN, the r of the model was significantly improved. The r value for GFS (Global forecast system) and UM (Unified model) increased from 0.77 to 0.87 and 0.70 to 0.83, respectively. The RMSE (Root mean square error), which indicates the model’s error rate, was also significantly improved (GFS: 5.01 to 6.52 ug/m3, UM: 5.76 to 7.44 ug/m3).

Especially, RL has shown successful performance for control problems, such as vehicles, robotics, and active structural control system. However, little research on application of RL to optimal structural design has conducted to date. In this study, the possibility of application of RL to structural design of reinforced concrete (RC) beam was investigated. The example of RC beam structural design problem introduced in previous study was used for comparative study. Deep q-network (DQN) is a famous RL algorithm presenting good performance in the discrete action space and thus it was used in this study. The action of DQN agent is required to represent design variables of RC beam. However, the number of design variables of RC beam is too many to represent by the action of conventional DQN. To solve this problem, multi-agent DQN was used in this study. For more effective reinforcement learning process, DDQN (Double Q-Learning) that is an advanced version of a conventional DQN was employed. The multi-agent of DDQN was trained for optimal structural design of RC beam to satisfy American Concrete Institute (318) without any hand-labeled dataset. Five agents of DDQN provides actions for beam with, beam depth, main rebar size, number of main rebar, and shear stirrup size, respectively.

멀티 에이전트 강화학습에서의 게이트 기반 메시지 교환,2023,"['multi-agent reinforcement learning', 'communication', 'representation learning']",,"An environment is a complex space in which numerous agents and objects interact. In this environment, rational agents act to maximize utility, and their actions are learned through reinforcement learning algorithms using deep neural networks. Since most environments are non-stationary, a single agent cannot solely achieve maximum utility through its observations and inferences using a network. However, when multiple agents can communicate with each other, a single agent can access richer information about the state of the environment simply by receiving messages from other agents. Nonetheless, the inferred information from other agents is generated by a neural network, which can be vulnerable or incorporate the personal perspective of the agents processing the information. For example, even when presented with a single observation, two agents can encode significantly different messages due to variations in their parameter modules. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the subjectivity of messages in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Building on the assumption that the encoded information is inherently subjective and reflects the agent that encodes it, we address the challenge of objective and subjective information in MARL. One limitation is that the information processed by a neural network is often challenging to interpret. In the initial phases of addressing this subjectivity concern, we focus on a relatively minor challenge: determining whether subjective information surpasses objective information in utility. Consequently, we compare the usefulness of messages exchanged between agents in two forms: raw observation and the output of a neural network."

Much research work showed that particulate matter is very toxic to humans, especially in high concentrations. For this reason, many countries make considerable efforts to regulate PM concentrations. In order to implement PM measures to reduce damage, an early warning system based on PM concentration level is essentially required. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D CNN ensemble prediction approach for forecasting PM2.5 concentrations in Seoul, Republic of Korea, which is observed every 6 hours for up to two days. The proposed method uses an ensemble of 3D deep CNNs that can utilize not only spatial information but also temporal information to extract and combine features for spatiotemporal data corresponding to each input. The combined features aim at extracting meaningful feature information through the shared layer and return the time-series predicted concentration for each period through the individual layer. The proposed method performs prediciton using PM2.5 and meteorological data of Seoul metropolitan area, ranging from 2015-01-01 to 2021-02-28. The proposed method was comprehensively evaluated for PM2.5 observation (Ground-truth), CMAQ forecast, and ConvLSTM. In terms of prediction performance, the proposed method showed improvement in performances with an increase of 7.06% in accuracy, an increase of 4.28% in probability of detection, and a decrease of 11.77% in false alram rate, compared to the widely used forecast model."

Alkaline environment of concrete makes a passive layer on the surface of reinforcement bars that prevents the bar from corrosion. However, when the chloride concentration amount at the reinforcement bar reaches a certain level, deterioration of the passive protection layer occurs, causing corrosion and ultimately reducing the structure’s safety and durability. Therefore, understanding the chloride diffusion and its prediction are important to evaluate the safety and durability of RC structure. In this study, the chloride diffusion coefficient is predicted by machine learning techniques. Various machine learning techniques such as multiple linear regression, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine, artificial neural networks, extreme gradient boosting annd k-nearest neighbor were used and accuracy of there models were compared.

Hydrodynamic analysis was conducted on 15 small fishing boats, and a database was established. Environmental conditions and main particulars were applied as input data, and the response amplitude operators were utilized as the output data. The motion response predicted by the trained deep neural network model showed similar trends to the hydrodynamic analysis results. The results showed that the high-frequency motion responses were predicted well with a low error.

Hapcheon Yujeon Village is Nammyeong(南冥) Jo Shik(曺植)’s wife's hometown and the residence of the Eunjin Song clan for generations. The entry of the Eunjin Song Clan into Yujeon Village began with Chungsunwi(忠順衛) Song Se-jeok(宋世勣), and Nammyeong had especially deep friendships with his eldest son, Song Hyeong(宋珩), and third son, Song Rin(宋璘). Song Jeong-ryeom is the great-grandson of Song Hyeong.His era was a time when the Nammyeong Study in the Gangwoo region declined after the Injo coup so that a clan conversion took place, and academically, the clan was seeking a way to live through a compromise with the Namin of Yeongnam and the Namin close to Gyeonggi in the Toegye side. Song Jeong-ryeom studied under Jeong On(鄭蘊) and Im Jin-bu(林眞怤), and also had a close friendship with Heo Mok(許穆), who was the leader of the Namin close to Gyeonggi at the time. In terms of the learning of his family, his father, Song Ik(宋翊), was an alumnus of the pupils of Jeong On, and in terms of inheritance of learning, his maternal uncle, Im Jin-bu, and his maternal great-grandfather, Cheommodang(瞻慕堂), Im Woon(林芸) were closely connected to the Toegye Study. Regionally, Hapcheon was the hometown of Nammyeong and Jeong In-hong, and Ipjae(立齋) Noh Heum(盧欽) and Nopa(蘆坡) Lee Heul (李屹) from the same hometown were Nammyeong's pupils. His father and maternal uncle studied under Noh Heum and Lee Heul. In short, Song Jeong-ryeom was a representative figure who inherited the Nammyeong Study and Toegye Study in the Gangwoo area, which continued to Jeong On-Im Jin-bu after Jeong In-hong.Song Jeong-ryeom was unable to enter government service due to Injo coup and the Manchu war of 1636, and spent his 30s in the Gangwoo region. However, after entering government service in his early 40s, he spent his late middle age and old age in government services. Official positions were continuously given to him until even three years before his death and it was very unusual for a literary person in Gangwoo region in the 17th century, and it was confirmed that it was very closely intertwined with the power of the Namin close to Gyeonggi at the time, including Heo Mok. At the same time, he conducted various social activities, such as serving as the director of six lecture halls, which corresponded to the bases of the Nammyeong and Toegye Studies in the Gangwoo region.After the death of Jonyangjae, the Gangwoo region continued to decline without showing any sign of revival, and after the outbreak of the Musin Rebellion (戊申亂, 1728), the wariness and distrust of the Gangwoo region grew stronger so that Gangwoo region further shrank. Strictly speaking, it is not an exaggeration to say that the academic lineage to Jeong On-Im Jin-bu after Jeong In-hong converged once with Song Jeong-ryeom, and after that, the academic lineage in the Gangwoo region centered on Hapcheon, Samga, and Geochang disappeared. It can be said that Song Jeong-ryeom was the last bastion of Gangwoo literary persons in the 17th century. This is the status of Jonyangjae as a Gangwoo literary person, and the reason why we should pay attention to him."

We derived inherent optical properties using this dataset based on a deep neural network. To evaluate performance, we compared it with a quasi-analytical algorithm and analyzed the impact of log transformation on the performance of the deep neural network algorithm in relation to data distribution. As a result, we found that the deep neural network algorithm accurately estimated the inherent optical properties except for the absorption coefficient of suspended particulate matter (R<sup>2</sup> greater than or equal to 0.9) and successfully separated the sum of the absorption coefficient of suspended particulate matter and dissolved organic matter into the absorption coefficient of suspended particulate matter and dissolved organic matter, respectively. We also observed that the algorithm, when directly applied without log transformation of the data, showed little difference in performance.

Various prediction models based on machine learning have been developed in the past; however, these models, relying solely on pattern analysis and outdoor temperature, may not guarantee high prediction accuracy. In this study, we developed three categories of heat consumption prediction models for district heating in residential buildings based on various independent variables. First, we collected data on heat consumption in residential buildings and used it as the dependent variable. In terms of the independent variables, we developed three models: model A, which focused on outdoor temperature; model B, which included various climatic factors; and model C, which added holiday and season to the climatic factors. We evaluated the prediction performance of these models. The R2 values of models C, B, and A were 0.8144, 0.7814, and 0.7596, respectively."

This method causes tremendous stress on workers and wastes time. To solve this problem, we implemented an automatic detection system for feeding time using deep neural network. The detection system consists of two steps: classification of the presence or absence of feed and checking DO (Dissolved Oxygen) of the pool. For the classification, the pretrained ResNet18 model and transfer learning with custom dataset are used. DO is obtained from the DO sensor in the pool through HTTP in real time. For better accuracy, the next step, checking DO proceeds when the result of the classification is absence of feed several times in a row. DO is checked if it is higher than a DO reference value that is set by the workers. These actions are performed automatically in the UI programs developed with LabVIEW."

Among them, senile dementia, which disrupts daily life, is best detected at an early stage because there is no cure, even with technological advances. However, many preliminary studies to predict dementia require continuous imaging data, such as MRI and retinal imaging data, and are expensive. These methods have the disadvantage that they cannot be applied to all people, so this study aims to develop low-cost predictive dementia detection. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify the main variables that most influenced the presence of dementia using deep learning prediction models such as XGBsoot and lightGBM by utilizing various activity data such as exercise duration, high-intensity activity duration, and metabolic rate, and sleep data such as deep sleep duration and breathing rate per minute to determine sleep quality. The analysis showed that the best dementia prediction performance was achieved when both activity and sleep data were considered simultaneously, and the most important variable in the XGBoost model was the “activity_score_move_every_hour” and the “sleep_hr_everage” in lightGBM."

For a more accurate prediction in contact-based CMP, it is necessary to consider the real-time changing pad surface roughness during polishing. Changes in pad surface roughness result in non-uniformity of the real contact pressure and friction applied to the wafer, which are the main causes of material removal rate variation. In this paper, we predicted the material removal rate based on pressure and surface roughness using a deep neural network (DNN). Reduced peak height (Rpk) and real contact area (RCA) were chosen as the key parameters indicative of the surface roughness of the pad, and 220 data were collected along with the process pressure. The collected data were normalized and separated in a 3 : 1 : 1 ratio to improve the predictive performance of the DNN model. The hyperparameters of the DNN model were optimized through random search techniques and 5 cross-validations. The optimized DNN model predicted the material removal rate with high accuracy in ex-situ CMP.

In the 2009 revised mathematics curriculum, matrices were removed from high school math education to reduce the burden on students, but in anticipation of the age of artificial intelligence, they will be reintegrated into the 2022 revised education curriculum. Therefore, there is a need to analyze the matrix content covered in other countries to suggest a meaningful direction for matrix education and to derive implications for textbook composition. In this study, we analyzed the German mathematics curriculum and standard education curriculum, as well as the matrix units in the German Hesse state mathematics curriculum and textbook, and identified the characteristics of their content elements and development methods. As a result of our analysis, it was found that the German textbooks cover matrices in three categories: matrices for solving linear equations, matrices for explaining linear transformations, and matrices for explaining transition processes. It was also found that the emphasis was on mathematical reasoning and modeling when learning matrices. Based on these findings, we suggest that if matrices are to be reintegrated into school mathematics, the curriculum should focus on deep conceptual understanding, mathematical reasoning, and mathematical modeling in textbook composition."

Traditional image enhancement methods have their own limitations when they are used for satellite images enhancement. This paper proposes an auto-encoder based image pre-enhancing method for satellite images. As a distorted satellite images dataset, images received from a real radio transmitter were used.

On the other hand, in an environment where it is difficult to obtain sufficient image data, there is a disadvantage in training a model, and the defense field is the representative example. The 3D model-based synthetic image in the simulated virtual environment corresponds to data generation to solve this problem by preparing a sufficient data pool for the computer to learn the object detection model. This is called Sim2Real learning, and a process of reducing the domain gap is required to guarantee the performance of Sim2Real learning. This study performed a fine-tuning process of re-learning with images collected from a real domain with weights of object detection model learned with synthetic images collected from the virtual domain, which is one of the domain adaptation techniques to reduce domain gap. This study analyzed whether the domain adaptation technique effectively detects performance by comparing the differences in results. As a result of the experiment, there was significant performance improvement through fine-tuning with a small number of real images. This can suggest a direction for learning object detection models in the field of national defense, where it is not easy to obtain training images of sufficient quantity and quality."

Limited Discriminator GAN using explainable AI model for overfitting problem,2023,['GANDiscriminatorGeneratorOverfittingExplainable AI'],,"Data-driven learning is the most representative deep learning method. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are designed to generate sufficient data to support such learning. The learning process of GAN models typically trains a generator and discriminator in turn. However, overfitting problems occur when the discriminator depends excessively on the training data. When this problem persists, the image created by the generator shows a similar appearance to the learning image. Images similar to learning images eventually lose the meaning of data augmentation. In this paper, we propose a limited discriminator GAN (LDGAN) model that explains the results of GAN, which is a model that can not be analyzed externally, such as a black box. The part explained in LDGAN becomes the discriminator model of GAN, and it is possible to check which area of the image is used as the basis for determining fake/real by the discriminator. In the end, a method for limiting the learning of discriminator is proposed based on the described results. Through this, it is possible to avoid the overfitting problem of the discriminator and to generate various images different from the learning image. The LDGAN method allows users to perform meaningful data augmentation with only specific objects except for complex images or backgrounds that require analysis. Compare the LDGAN method with the existing DCGAN and present the extensive simulation results. The extensive simulation result shows that the image generated by the proposed LDGAN including the estimation area is about 10% more."

This paper proposes a method to reduce the computation complexity of the deep learning-based bearing faults diagnosis. The acoustic emission signals obtained from the working bearings are converted into spectrogram images, and CNN models are then applied to monitor the bearings' status. The mechanical facilities adopted in real industrial sites have difficulty using expensive processing devices, such as high-performance GPUs. Therefore, a bearing fault diagnosis method for embedded systems is necessary. The proposed method consists of two phases: an initial fault diagnosis phase that classifies normal/abnormal states and a fault-type classification phase determining the defect type for abnormal states. Our experiments using a Raspberry Pi board reveal that the proposed method decreases the time for bearing faults diagnosis by approximately 55% without compromising diagnostic accuracy."

However, most of the gene-phenotype relationship data are buried in the biomedical literature in textual form.Objective We propose RelCurator, a curation system that extracts sentences including both gene and phenotype entities related to specific disease categories from PubMed articles, provides rich additional information such as entity taggings, and predictions of gene–phenotype relationships.Methods We targeted neurodegenerative disorders and developed a deep learning model using Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) networks and BioWordVec word embeddings for predicting gene–phenotype relationships from biomedical texts. The prediction model is trained with more than 130,000 labeled PubMed sentences including gene and phenotype entities, which are related to or unrelated to neurodegenerative disorders.Results We compared the performance of our deep learning model with those of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and simple Recurrent Neural Network (simple RNN) models. Our model performed better with an F1-score of 0.96. Furthermore, the evaluation done using a few curation cases in the real scenario showed the effectiveness of our work. Therefore, we conclude that RelCurator can identify not only new causative genes, but also new genes associated with neurodegenerative disorders’ phenotype.Conclusion RelCurator is a user-friendly method for accessing deep learning-based supporting information and a concise web interface to assist curators while browsing the PubMed articles.

The book employs many persuasive tactics, most notably the use of metaphors. This paper is intended to understand by metaphor analysis how the authors manage to enhance persuasiveness of the book by using metaphors, which are conceptual frameworks for looking at the world that influence a person's perception of things. The authors caution that metaphors such as [AI IS PERSON] and [THE REAL WORLD IS THE WORLD OF A MOVIE] cause people to be unreasonably concerned that AI might have a will and rebel against humans. By means of metaphors such as [AI IS INTELLIGENCE] and [AI IS CHANNEL], the book presents the authors' assertions effectively and makes them easily accepted by  readers. Metaphors facilitate the communication of ideas by acting as a lens through which familiar objects can be seen in relation to less familiar ones. Through the metaphor [RESEARCHING AI IS JOURNEY], they present impressively that contemporary AI should make a new start to be a reliable artificial intelligence. With the metaphor [COMMONSENSE IS MOUNTAIN], they effectively transmit that a new AI based on commonsense is hard to achieve but attainable if we take the right path. The authors not only clearly present various notions related to AI with metaphors such as [RESEARCHING AI IS SOLVING OPTIMIZATION] and [MENTAL SPACE IS MAP], but metaphors also trigger emotional responses by creating a sense of freshness through scarcity. In the book, the difficulty of a halibut making a shot is analogized as the difficulty of deep learning reasoning a virtual situation. Conceptual metaphors such as [RESEARCHING AI IS CHILDCARE] are used to appeal to the readers' emotions by comparing abandoning learning in AI research to the folly of throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Thus various uses of metaphors in the book help readers understand more easily and sympathetically accept the arguments of the authors."

The deep learning model consisted of four convolutional layers and was trained with a weakly supervised learning method that can provide object localization only using image-level labeling. Localization of the soybean area can be visualized via CAM and the two-dimensional position of the soybean was estimated by clustering the pixels associated with the soybean area and transforming the pixel coordinates to world coordinates.

Multi-head de-noising autoencoder-based multi-task model for fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings under various speed conditions,2023,"['fault diagnosis', 'various speed conditions', 'de-noising autoencoder', 'multi-head CNN', 'multi-task learning']",,"Fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings (REBs), one type of essential mechanical element, has been actively researched; recent research has focused on the use of deep-learning-based approaches. However, conventional deep-learning-based fault-diagnosis approaches are vulnerable to various operating speeds, which greatly affect the vibration characteristics of the system studied. To solve this problem, previous deep-learning-based studies have usually been carried out by increasing the complexity of the model or diversifying the task of the model. Still, limitations remain because the reason of increasing complexity is unclear and the roles of multiple tasks are not well-defined. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-head de-noising autoencoder-based multi-task model for robust diagnosis of REBs under various speed conditions. The proposed model employs a multi-head de-noising autoencoder and multi-task learning strategy to robustly extract features under various speed conditions, while effectively disentangling the speed- and fault-related information.

Performance analysis of coexistence of traditional communication system and emerging semantic communication system,2023,['Performance analysisSemantic communication systemCoexistence'],,"As a new paradigm, semantic communication (SC) is attracting attention as the next-generation communication. In order to develop semantic communication systems, the research trend is to adopt deep learning networks with the best performance in each field of deep learning. Deep-learning based SC systems are task-dependent because the deep networks employed are specialized to perform specific tasks. Therefore, SC systems cannot be used for users using applications that do not work with the deep networks exploited by the SC systems. Such users still should be served by a traditional communication (TC) system. Hence, in the near future, communication networks will face the coexistence of both SC system and TC system, and thus a base station (BS) has to simultaneously transmit symbol streams encoded by an SC system and a TC system via orthogonal frequency-division multiple access. Although the current works verify that SC systems outperform a TC system in a point-to-point communication, it is necessary to analyze whether the introduction of SC systems can also improve the network performance provided by a BS. In this paper, we investigate the impact of introducing the new emerging semantic communication on network performance by modeling signal-to-noise ratio of SC users served by SC systems and analyzing sum-rate maximization with a minimum required SNR constraint for SC users. Via extensive numerical results, changes in network performance with and without an SC system are discussed with varying the distances from a BS, the number of SC users served by an SC system, and the degree of SC performance."

However, font recommendation systems predominantly base their similarity criteria on character shape and frame attributes, overlooking weight as a criterion. Existing machine learning approaches that rely on data extracted from some factors tend to exhibit limitations in terms of accuracy. In light of these limitations, this study aims to design weight criteria for characters to allow more precise font discrimination in machine learning. For this purpose, the design of weight criteria in past studies by PANOSE (1991-1997) and Kim (2019) were analyed, each pertaining to the Latin alphabet and Hangeul respectively. The analysis revealed the limitations of the existing Hangeul weight criteria, which, similar to the approach adopted for the Latin alphabet, select discrimination areas by inducing countless stroke weight variables. Factors considered in the design of supplementary criteria for stroke weight measurement were weight change factors of strokes that appear in Hangeul character combinations, morpheme, and baseline. The supplementary stroke weight criteria focused on the vertical stem width of composite characters “마, 맘, 모, 몸, 뫄, 뫔” created from syllabic blocks such as “ᄆ, ᅡ” and “ᅩ”. A specific unit of font discrimination was proposed, where the final weight measurement is calculated by averaging the values obtained from discrimination areas. The results provide a concrete basis for font similarity assessment, taking into account character differentiation factors that can be utilized in the font recommendation system development through weight, and expected to contribute to recommendation of fonts with various impressions."
Enhancing Low-light Images for Monocular Visual Odometry in Challenging Lighting Conditions,2023,"['Deep learning', 'generative adversarial network', 'low-light image enhancement', 'style transfer', 'visual odometry.']",,"Visual odometry (VO) estimates the robot’s current position based on feature matching or brightness variation between images, making it primarily suitable for well-lit environments with good image quality. Consequently, existing visual odometry methods exhibit degraded performance in low-light or highly dynamic environments, limiting their operational efficiency in outdoor settings. To overcome these challenges, research has been conducted to enhance low-light images to improve odometry performance. Recent advancements in deep learning have facilitated extensive research on image enhancement, including low-light conditions. Utilizing generative adversarial networks (GANs) and techniques like CycleGAN, researchers have achieved robust improvements in various lighting conditions and enhanced odometry performance in low-light environments. However, these methods are typically trained on single images, compromising the structural consistency between consecutive images. In this paper, we propose learning-based low-light image enhancement and the preservation of structural consistency between consecutive images for monocular visual odometry. The proposed model utilizes the CycleGAN approach for domain transformation between different illumination levels, effectively avoiding the failure of visual odometry in low-light environments. To handle diverse lighting conditions within images, a local discriminator is employed to enhance local brightness. Additionally, a structure loss is introduced using sequence images to ensure structural consistency between the original and generated images. This method simultaneously improves low-light conditions and preserves structural consistency, leading to enhanced visual odometry performance in low-light environments."
Airfoil GAN: encoding and synthesizing airfoils for aerodynamic shape optimization,2023,"['deep learning', 'generative adversarial network', 'airfoil design', 'design optimization']",,"The current design of aerodynamic shapes, like airfoils, involves computationally intensive simulations to explore the possible design space. Usually, such design relies on the prior definition of design parameters and places restrictions on synthesizing novel shapes. In this work, we propose a data-driven shape encoding and generating method, which automatically learns representations from existing airfoils and uses the learned representations to generate new airfoils. The representations are then used in the optimization of synthesized airfoil shapes based on their aerodynamic performance. Our model is built upon VAEGAN, a neural network that combines Variational Autoencoder with Generative Adversarial Network and is trained by the gradient-based technique. Our model can (1) encode the existing airfoil into a latent vector and reconstruct the airfoil from that, (2) generate novel airfoils by randomly sampling the latent vectors and mapping the vectors to the airfoil coordinate domain, and (3) synthesize airfoils with desired aerodynamic properties by optimizing learned features via a genetic algorithm. Our experiments show that the learned features encode shape information thoroughly and comprehensively without predefined design parameters. By interpolating/extrapolating feature vectors or sampling from Gaussian noises, the model can automatically synthesize novel airfoil shapes, some of which possess competitive or even better aerodynamic properties as compared to airfoils used for model training purposes. By optimizing shapes on the learned latent domain via a genetic algorithm, synthesized airfoils can evolve to target aerodynamic properties. This demonstrates an efficient learning-based airfoil design framework that encodes and optimizes the airfoil on the latent domain and synthesizes promising airfoil candidates for required aerodynamic performance."

A millimeter wave radar is used to solve the problem of personal information infringement that may occur in conventional CCTV image-based pose estimation. Deep learning-based pose estimation models generally use convolution neural networks. The convolution neural network is a combination of convolution layers and pooling layers of different types, and there are many cases of convolution filter size, number, and convolution operations, and more cases of combining components. Therefore, it is difficult to find the structure and components of the optimal posture estimation model for input data. Compared with conventional millimeter wave-based posture estimation studies, it is possible to explore the structure and components of the optimal posture estimation model for input data using genetic algorithms, and the performance of optimizing the proposed posture estimation model is excellent.

We propose a novel key-point extraction algorithm that automatically adapts to the target image without any manual threshold setting. In our adaptive key-point extraction algorithm, we propose a line-level normalization method to distinguish the lane region from the background clearly. Then, we extract a representative key point for each lane at a line (row of an image) using a kernel density estimation.

The height of general pedestrians encompasses various scales, such as those of infants, adolescents, and adults, so when the model is applied to one group, the extraction of data becomes inaccurate.

FakedBits- Detecting Fake Information on Social Platforms using Multi-Modal Features,2023,"['Deep learning', 'Learning systems', 'Social networking sites', 'Fake information', 'Multi-modal']",,"Social media play a significant role in communicating information across the globe, connecting with loved ones, getting the news, communicating ideas, etc. However, a group of people uses social media to spread fake information, which has a bad impact on society. Therefore, minimizing fake news and its detection are the two primary challenges that need to be addressed. This paper presents a multi-modal deep learning technique to address the above challenges. The proposed modal can use and process visual and textual features. Therefore, it has the ability to detect fake information from visual and textual data. We used EfficientNet-B0 and a sentence transformer, respectively, for detecting counterfeit images and for textural learning. Feature embedding is performed at individual channels, whilst fusion is done at the last classification layer. The late fusion is applied intentionally to mitigate the noisy data that are generated by multi-modalities. Extensive experiments are conducted, and performance is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods. Three real-world benchmark datasets, such as MediaEval (Twitter), Weibo, and Fakeddit, are used for experimentation. Result reveals that the proposed modal outperformed the state-of-the-art methods and achieved an accuracy of 86.48%, 82.50%, and 88.80%, respectively, for MediaEval (Twitter), Weibo, and Fakeddit datasets."

This makes them an effective and stable form of biometric data, commonly used in personal authentication and security access systems. As a result, there has been an increase in unauthorized access incidents caused by forged fingerprints. To prevent illegal authentication, deep learning-based forged fingerprint detection models have been introduced. However, these deep learning models require substantial computational resources due to their numerous parameters, often necessitating the use of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Since it's challenging to always employ high-performance GPU systems in typical forged fingerprint detection scenarios, there's a need for lightweight forged fingerprint detection techniques. In this study, we propose a forged fingerprint detection method utilizing a median filter for fingerprint image preprocessing and an ensemble model with fewer parameters. Our proposed method, despite having significantly fewer parameters than conventional deep learning models, achieved a forged fingerprint detection accuracy of 96%. As our forged fingerprint detection model exhibits high speed and accuracy even in a standard CPU environment, it is anticipated to be beneficial in various smart devices and security systems for identifying forged fingerprints."

활성화 함수 근사를 통한 지수함수 기반 신경망 마스킹 기법,2023,"['AI', 'Activation Function', 'Deep Learning', 'Side Channel Analysis', 'Masking']",,"This paper proposes a method to increase the power-analysis resistance of the neural network model's feedforward process by replacing the exponential-based activation function, used in the deep-learning field, with an approximated function especially at the multi-layer perceptron model. Due to its nature, the feedforward process of neural networks calculates secret weight and bias, which already trained, so it has risk of exposure of internal information by side-channel attacks. However, various functions are used as the activation function in neural network, so it's difficult to apply conventional side-channel countermeasure techniques, such as masking, to activation function(especially, to exponential-based activation functions). Therefore, this paper shows that even if an exponential-based activation function is replaced with approximated function of simple form, there is no fatal performance degradation of the model, and than suggests a power-analysis resistant feedforward neural network with exponential-based activation function, by masking approximated function and whole network."

Research on Chinese Microblog Sentiment Classification Based on TextCNN-BiLSTM Model,2023,"['Chinese Microblog Review', 'Deep Learning', 'Sentiment Classification', 'TextCNN-BiLSTM']",,"Currently, most sentiment classification models on microblogging platforms analyze sentence parts of speechand emoticons without comprehending users’ emotional inclinations and grasping moral nuances. This studyproposes a hybrid sentiment analysis model. Given the distinct nature of microblog comments, the modelemploys a combined stop-word list and word2vec for word vectorization. To mitigate local information loss,the TextCNN model, devoid of pooling layers, is employed for local feature extraction, while BiLSTM isutilized for contextual feature extraction in deep learning.

Our exploration results underscore the potential of sentiment analysis as a methodology for analysis in literary studies. We utilized three distinct measures to process sentiment scores: mean sentiment scores, moving average sentiment curves, and cumulative sentiment curves. Each of these measures consistently resonated with the play’s themes and content, thereby underscoring their relevance in literary studies. Specifically, mean sentiment scores proved beneficial in encapsulating the overall sentiment profiles of the characters. Moving average sentiment curves excelled in tracing the dynamic fluctuations of sentiment throughout the narrative. Lastly, cumulative sentiment curves offered a comprehensive perspective of sentiment trends across the play.

In particular, this study aimed to develop a deep learning-based identification model utilizing the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) algorithm for Korean speakers who stutter. To this aim, speech data were collected from 9 adults who stutter and 9 normally-fluent speakers. The data were automatically segmented at the phrasal level using Google Cloud speech-to-text (STT), and labels such as ‘fluent’, ‘blockage’, prolongation’, and ‘repetition’ were assigned to them. Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and the CNN-based classifier were also used for detecting and classifying each type of the stuttered disfluency. However, in the case of prolongation, five results were found and, therefore, excluded from the classifier model. Results showed that the accuracy of the CNN classifier was 0.96, and the F1-score for classification performance was as follows: ‘fluent’ 1.00, ‘blockage’ 0.67, and ‘repetition’ 0.74. Although the effectiveness of the automatic classification identifier was validated using CNNs to detect the stuttered disfluencies, the performance was found to be inadequate especially for the blockage and prolongation types. Consequently, the establishment of a big speech database for collecting data based on the types of stuttered disfluencies was identified as a necessary foundation for improving classification performance."

3D Urban Building Reconstruction through Neural Rendering and UAV Imagery,2023,"['3D Building Modeling', 'Deep Learning', 'Neural Radiance Field', 'Unmanned Aerial Vehicle']",,"The growing emphasis on smart cities and digital twins has heightened the significance of 3D geospatial information. Creating 3D models for urban buildings is a crucial area of interest but is severely labor-intensive and time-consuming. So, research has been conducted to reconstruct 3D urban structures automatically, employing various sensors. While there have been various studies on creating 3D models using UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) images, increasing the overlap between images to secure matching points and using an exponentially increased number of images for computation was mainly confirmed. Additionally, even when a sufficient number of input images were available, there were limitations in fully reconstructing all facets of a building, leading to instances where data from other sensor-based sources was needed. Therefore, in this study, we utilized only UAV images to create a point cloud using a deep learning-based neural rendering model and supplemented the occluded areas in conventional methodologies. We examined how processing time and Gaussian standard deviation change while generating building models by reducing the number of input images, comparing with ground truth derived from photogrammetry. Creating the 3D model with deep learning just took 25.251 minutes, a significant improvement from the 84.284 minutes required by the traditional method. Furthermore, even with a reduction of over three-quarters in the number of input images, the Gaussian standard deviation only showed a marginal difference of 0.203 meters compared to the entire image set. It underscores the effectiveness of our approach in supplementing occluded areas, surpassing the limitations observed in existing methods."

CLS 토큰으로 초기화된 양방향 LSTM을 이용한 DPT 기반 단안 깊이 추정 모델의 성능 향상,2023,"['monocular depth estimation', 'vision transformer', 'LSTM', 'transfer learning', 'bi-directional long-short term memory']",,"Monocular depth estimation (MDE) is a computer vision task that estimates the depth value for each pixel in a single monocular RGB image. Given its inherently ill-posed nature, recent studies have focused on data-driven learning-based methods, particularly deep learning techniques based on convolutional neural networks. Building on the success of vision transformers (ViTs), ViT-based models have gained widespread attention for MDE applications. To enhance the performance of MDE, we introduce an intermediate bi-directional long-short term memory (BiLSTM) module, a common component in natural language processing, to learn correlations between each token in a sequence both in the forward and backward directions. Given that transformers naturally encode sequential data, leveraging BiLSTMs to learn the correlations between each token in both directions is a reasonable approach. In addition, we enhance the weight initialization method for BiLSTMs by employing the CLS tokens of transformers, which was originally developed for natural language processing, to make it applicable for processing two-dimensional image data. Subsequently, we developed an MDE model by inserting a BiLSTM module initialized using our method between the encoder and decoder of a DPT-based architecture. Our experiments reveal notable results, with our model achieving 0.913 in δ_1 and 0.097 in AbsRel for the NYU Depth V2 dataset.

Mask R-CNN과 겹침 처리 알고리즘을 활용한 상단의 원형 객체 검출 및 자세 추정,2023,"['pose estimation', 'overlap handling algorithm', 'plane estimation', 'deep learning']",,"This paper proposes an algorithm for detecting and estimating the pose of top objects in a complex environment where thin metal circular plates are randomly stacked. In complex environments where multiple instances of the same object are randomly stacked, the robot needs to detect and compare objects to identify the top ones for grasping. Our approach involves a combination of deep learning-based instance segmentation and an overlap handling algorithm for precise top object detection. Subsequently, leveraging three-dimensional geometric data, we estimate the object's pose by determining its plane. To validate the proposed algorithm, we constructed two environments consisting of objects with different sizes and thicknesses. The first experiment quantitatively validated the object detection and overlap handling algorithm. The second experiment quantitatively compared different plane estimation algorithms. The third experiment quantitatively compared the pose of objects using the G-ICP (Generalized Iterative Closest Point) algorithm and the proposed algorithm against the ground truth pose. Additionally, we performed a qualitative comparison by visualizing the poses estimated by each algorithm in the images. In the experimental results, the overlap handling algorithm had an average success rate of 84.21%. Additionally, pose estimation using G-ICP before plane estimation frequently resulted in issues like drift in the center point and frequent misalignment with areas other than the object. On the other hand, pose estimation using G-ICP after plane estimation and the proposed algorithm yielded similar performance with average ADD-S values of 6mm or less. However, the pose estimated using the proposed algorithm resulted in a minimum 0.25x reduction in execution time compared to the G-ICP algorithm."

Specialists typically use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images to diagnose tumors, and accurate diagnosis is crucial for initiating early treatment. This study proposes a computer-aided specialized system for brain-tumor classification using MRI images that can assist specialists in diagnosing brain tumors. We used an object classification algorithm based on deep-learning networks and augmented the dataset using the ImageNet augmentation policy of AutoAugment to optimize brain-tumor classification performance. Gaussian filtering was applied to enhance the quality of MRI images by removing white Gaussian noise; the parameter value that exhibited relatively high performance in MRI images was determined by varying the sigma values of the Gaussian filter.

The attitude scores were then compared among various factors such as topics, media’s political orientation, and governments political orientation. Additionally, this study analyzed the relationship between corporate news attitude and businessmen’s economic evaluation.First of all, topic modeling analysis revealed that corporate reporting was comprised of 7 dimensions: product-sales, economy-policy, technology-new product, investment-business, management-share, personnel-employment, and suspicion-investigation. These dimensions encompass most activities of corporations and demonstrate the suitability of this classification for corporate news analysis.Furthermore, the research team developed a training dataset (n = 3,198) for positive-negative classification based on the YTN and Yonhap Infomax’s corporate news. After the team trained a BERT-based deep-learning model several times, the final model showed an accuracy rate of 94.69%.This model measured the attitude of every corporate news article and showed that the majority of the news coverage was generally positive. Nearly two-thirds (62.64%) were classified as positive, and the average attitude scores of analyzed news media were higher than 0.5 (closer to 0 is negative, and closer to 1 is positive). It implies that the trend of market-driven journalism has been strengthened as the number of news media increases and their competition intensifies.Additionally, there was a significant difference in the attitude of corporate news between conservative and progressive media. Conservative media showed more positive coverage of companies than progressive media. Even in the news on corporate scandals and investigations, conservative media were less critical than progressive media. According to previous research, there is a claim that pro-business bias is a main discourse strategy for conservative groups. Since the 1990s, neo-liberalism has been accepted as an important value in our society, and competition and deregulation have been highly valued. Economically, businesses in their pursuit of freedom and profits should be positively considered with the expectation of the trickle-down effects. On the other hand, progressive groups have emphasized government’s intervention to decrease economic polarization and have been critical of businesses. Nowadays conservative and progressive media also maintain these different perspectives and make significant differences in their corporate news.The relationship between corporate news attitudes and businessmen’s economic evaluation has shown various results. Corporate news affected the businessmen’s economic evaluation in the topics of technology-new products and suspicion-investigation while it was vice versa in the topics of product-sales, management-share, and personnel-employment. Such inter-relationship was more significant in conservative media than progressive media and in large companies rather than small companies. To improve corporate news coverage, the voice of progressive media needs to increase and there should be more interest in small companies."

Developing a Method to Detect Indoor Spatial Entities in Omnidirectional Images for Constructing IndoorGML Data,2023,"['Object Detection', 'Omnidirectional Image', 'IndoorGML', 'Deep Learning']",,"The continuous increase in interest in indoor space demands the development of LBSs (Location Based Services) for navigation, routing, and space query in these environments. Applications providing these services must use visualization and topology data together to provide relevant services to users. Applications have frequently used geometric object-based visualization models for indoor space LBSs. These have the advantage of being easy to use with IndoorGML, an indoor topology model, but have the disadvantage of high construction cost and heavy data. Correspondingly, the image-based visualization model drew attention as an alternative model. However, using such models requires identifying objects on the image to be used alongside IndoorGML, presenting a limitation because it is difficult to identify objects in the image pixels directly. To overcome the limitations of image-based visualization models and reconsider the usability of indoor space LBS using images, this study presents a method to automatically detect spatial objects required to construct IndoorGML from images using deep learning. This methodology aims to detect objects mainly used in indoor LBSs, which include door and stair objects portrayed in indoor omnidirectional images. This study proposes a detailed method of constructing a training dataset for indoor spatial object detection. Moreover, this research presents a method of refining the training dataset and directly acquiring omnidirectional image data to train it as an object detection model that can be used universally in various buildings while maintaining compliant accuracy."

It detects the point where the average change becomes larger than the threshold as the sign language start point, and the point where the average change becomes smaller than the threshold as the sign language end point. As a result of the performance evaluation, it is confirmed that the start and end points of sign language can be accurately detected within an average of about two frames when using information on 10 keypoints."

Surrogate Model Based on Data-Driven Model Reduction for Inelastic Behavior of Composite Microstructure,2023,"['Data-driven', 'Model order reduction', 'Inelasticity', 'Surrogate model', 'Deep learning']",,"On the microscale, most composite materials are composed of heterogeneous materials comprising two or more different phases, such as matrices and inclusions. In addition, composite materials may exhibit high variability, depending on the material and amount of material used. Hence, the effect of microstructure on the macroscopic structural analysis of composite materials must be considered. Computational homogenization can be used to describe an effective constitutive model for heterogeneous composites at the microscopic level. However, a significant computational cost may be incurred owing to the iterative procedure when considering the inelastic behavior of composite materials. Hence, an efficient data-driven model reduction technique, i.e., a deep-learned surrogate model, is proposed. The key idea of the proposed framework is twofold: (1) Data-driven unsupervised model reduction for efficiently managing high-dimensional data from the microstructure and for extracting those features, and (2) the construction of parameterized constitutive models with inelastic behavior by connecting macro- and microscopic levels. Each aspect leverages a variational autoencoder and a gated recurrent unit, which are state-of-the-art components for deep learning. To demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed model, the proposed model is applied to a two-dimensional microstructure problem involving inelastic behavior. Consequently, it is discovered that the present surrogate model can provide improved computational efficiency and accuracy within a prescribed parametric space."

Recently, deep learning-based semantic segmentation networks demonstrated the promising performance for pixel-level image classification. However, deep learning-based approaches are generally limited by the requirement of a sufficient amount of labeled data to obtain stable accuracy, and acquiring reference labels of remotely-sensed VHR images is very labor-extensive and expensive. Hence, this paper applied a semi-supervised learning-based CycleGAN and EfficientNet for VHR remote sensing image classification to overcome this problem. The proposed method achieved the highest accuracy than the other benchmarks. The largest increase in accuracy was observed in a test site containing complex objects due to the regularization effect of the semi-supervised method using unlabeled data. Moreover, results indicated that a relatively sufficient amount of unlabeled data compared with labeled data are required to increase the classification accuracy by controlling the amount of labeled and unlabeled data. Finally, we verified that the semi-supervised method returned significantly improved results irrespective of the three classification network structures, displaying the applicability of the method for semi-supervised image classification on remotely-sensed VHR images."

Preservice Teachers' Beliefs about Integrating Artificial Intelligence in Mathematics Education: A Scale Development Study,2023,"['artificial intelligence', 'teacher beliefs', 'preservice teachers', 'scale development']",,"Recently, AI has become a crucial tool in mathematics education due to advances in machine learning and deep learning. Considering the importance of AI, examining teachers’ beliefs about AI in mathematics education (AIME) is crucial, as these beliefs affect their instruction and student learning experiences. The present study developed a scale to measure preservice teachers’ (PST) beliefs about AIME through factor analysis and rigorous reliability and validity analyses. The study analyzed 202 PST’s data and developed a scale comprising three factors and 11 items. The first factor gauges PSTs' beliefs regarding their roles in using AI for mathematics education (4 items), the second factor assesses PSTs' beliefs about using AI for mathematics teaching (3 items), and the third factor explores PSTs' beliefs about AI for mathematics learning (4 items). Moreover, the outcomes of confirmatory factor analysis affirm that the three-factor model outperforms other models (a one-factor or a two-factor model). These findings are in line with previous scales examining mathematics teacher beliefs, reinforcing the notion that such beliefs are multifaceted and developed through diverse experiences. Descriptive analysis reveals that overall PSTs exhibit positive beliefs about AIME. However, they show relatively lower levels of beliefs about their roles in using AI for mathematics education.

Due to the difficulties in obtaining real-world LR-HR datasets, most SR models have used only HRimages and generated LR images with predefined degradation such as bicubic downsampling. However, SRmodels trained on simple image degradation do not reflect the properties of the images and often result indeteriorated SR qualities when applied to real-world images.

Deep learning based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has been verified for its performance in various areas. It has also demonstrated high recognition accuracy and detection time in agricultural applications such as pest and disease diagnosis and prediction. A large amount of data is required to train CNNs effectively. Still, since UAVs capture only a limited number of images, we propose a data augmentation method that can effectively increase data. And most occupancy prediction predicts occupancy by designing a CNN-based object detector for an image and counting the number of recognized objects or calculating the number of pixels occupied by an object.

In order to make a corpus, a lot of corpus data is extracted through human translation, and a high-quality corpus is made through refining based on detailed guidelines. Here, we tried to confirm the purification process of how the extracted corpus data were selected.As a result of checking the corpus purification process, words such as various titles, items, and names, metrological units or number of people were all excluded.Short sentences containing place names, human names, government posts, places, products, dates, and proper nouns were also removed because they were not appropriate as corpus. In addition, prefixes consisting of one or two letters, such as adverbs, conjunctions, tense, and pronounciation at the beginning of the sentence, were deleted. In the future, it is expected that the time and expense of translation will be greatly reduced if extraction is carried out in consideration of these contents in the construction of corpus for AI-based Chinese character translation."
Chinese-clinical-record Named Entity Recognition using IDCNN-BiLSTM-Highway Network,2023,"['Bidirectional long short-term memory network', 'Chinese named entity recognition', 'Conditional random field', 'Highway network', 'Iterated dilated convolutional neural network']",,"Chinese named entity recognition (NER) is a challenging work that seeks to find, recognize and classify various types of information elements in unstructured text. Due to the Chinese text has no natural boundary like the spaces in the English text, Chinese named entity identification is much more difficult. At present, most deep learning based NER models are developed using a bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM), yet the performance still has some space to improve. To further improve their performance in Chinese NER tasks, we propose a new NER model, IDCNN-BiLSTM-Highway, which is a combination of the BiLSTM, the iterated dilated convolutional neural network (IDCNN) and the highway network. In our model, IDCNN is used to achieve multiscale context aggregation from a long sequence of words. Highway network is used to effectively connect different layers of networks, allowing information to pass through network layers smoothly without attenuation. Finally, the global optimum tag result is obtained by introducing conditional random field (CRF). The experimental results show that compared with other popular deep learning-based NER models, our model shows superior performance on two Chinese NER data sets: Resume and Yidu-S4k, The F1-scores are 94.98 and 77.59, respectively."
저탐지 수중 표적 추적을 위한 딥러닝 기반 분할 네트워크,2023,"['DeepNetwork-based segmentation model', 'Bearing-time records image', 'Low detectable underwater target tracking']",,"In submarine combat systems, passive sonars are used to detect enemy targets without exposing the ship's location. Since bearing information can be obtained through passive sonar, and information about distance can be obtained by performing additional target maneuver analysis using the obtained bearing information, it is important to secure accurate bearing information. The signal received through the passive sonar can be represented by imaging the target's bearing information with respect to time, which is called BTR(Bearing-Time Records) data. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based segmentation network to improve the target detection rate from BTR data. Since it is difficult to obtain the actual target bearing data as military information, a simulated BTR dataset was created and network learning and experiments were conducted through it. In particular, we propose a Spatial Convolutional Layer-based segmentation network to well extract target objects in BTR images with directionality. The proposed model shows the best target detection performance compared to the existing deep learning-based segmentation model in experimental datasets with various intensity noise environments and target detection probabilities."
Condition Monitoring of Railway Pantograph Using R-CNN and Image Processing,2023,"['Electric railway', 'Pantograph', 'Contact strip', 'Maintenance']",,"A railway pantograph supplies a vehicle with the electric power from the OCL (Overhead Contact Line). The contact strip, which directly contacts the OCL, is vulnerable to wear and should be periodically replaced to prevent accidents from power outages. To that end, the pantograph is regularly checked visually during routine maintenance, along with the panhead which includes the horn and the contact strip. However, real-time monitoring is still difficult, and a reliable method needs to be developed. The existing methods use image processing to detect the actual condition of the contact strip. In this paper, we suggest a method for detecting the wear size of the contact strip using image processing and deep learning. In addition, we demonstrate how to assess the condition of the panhead and the horn in the contact. The monitoring equipment is built on the test bed and is automatically configured to acquire images of the moving pantograph. The tilt of the panhead is estimated from image recognition and the condition of the horn is assessed with deep learning. In the future, this method can be used not only for efficient pantograph maintenance but also for determining the performance according to the contact condition."

As online services of real estate increases, people’s evaluation on the residential environment can be easily checked and it is possible to analyze their satisfaction and its determining factors based on their evaluation. This means that a larger amount of evaluation can be used more efficiently than previously used methods such as surveys. This study analyzed the residential environment reviews of about 30,000 apartment residents collected from ‘Zigbang’, an online real estate service in Seoul. The apartment review of Zigbang consists of an evaluation grade on a 5-point scale and the evaluation content directly described by the dweller. At first, this study labeled apartment reviews as positive and negative based on the scores of recommended reviews that include comprehensive evaluation about apartment. Next, to classify them automatically, developed a model by using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers(BERT), a deep learning-based natural language processing model. After that, by using SHapley Additive exPlanation(SHAP), extract word tokens that play an important role in the classification of reviews, to derive determining factors of the evaluation of the residential environment. Furthermore, by analyzing related keywords using Word2Vec, priority considerations for improving satisfaction on the residential environment were suggested. This study is meaningful that suggested a model that automatically classifies satisfaction on the residential environment into positive and negative by using apartment review big data and deep learning, which are qualitative evaluation data of residents, so that it’s determining factors were derived. The result of analysis can be used as elementary data for improving the satisfaction on the residential environment, and can be used in the future evaluation of the residential environment near the apartment complex, and the design and evaluation of new complexes and infrastructure."

The first dataset included 14 4D lung CT scans and 31 head and neck CT scans. In the 4D lung CT dataset, we employed the DIR algorithm to register organs at risk and tumors based on respiratory phases. The second dataset comprised pre-, mid-, and post-treatment CT images of the head and neck region, along with organ at risk and tumor delineations. These images underwent registration using the DIR algorithm, and Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) were compared. In the 4D lung CT dataset, registration accuracy was evaluated for the spinal cord, lung, lung nodules, esophagus, and tumors. The average DSCs for the non-learning-based SyN and NiftyReg algorithms were 0.92±0.07 and 0.88±0.09, respectively. Deep learning methods, namely Voxelmorph, Cyclemorph, and Transmorph, achieved average DSCs of 0.90±0.07, 0.91±0.04, and 0.89±0.05, respectively. For the head and neck CT dataset, the average DSCs for SyN and NiftyReg were 0.82±0.04 and 0.79±0.05, respectively, while Voxelmorph, Cyclemorph, and Transmorph showed average DSCs of 0.80±0.08, 0.78±0.11, and 0.78±0.09, respectively.

In conclusion, this study highlights the varying clinical applicability of deep learning-based DIR methods in different anatomical regions. While challenges were encountered in head and neck CT registrations, 4D lung CT registrations exhibited favorable results, indicating the potential for clinical implementation. Further research and development in DIR algorithms tailored to specific anatomical regions are warranted to improve the overall clinical utility of these methods."

No professor can enter a new era without any preparation for the newspaper because Generative AI is not a temporary trend, but a megatrend today. that will drastically change society as a whole. In addition, more efficient operation is possible if Generative AIs are used for lectures. However, this study focused on Chat GPT and Bard, leaving research related to HiberClova X developed by Naver as a future task.In the past, AI conducted learning based on Noam Chomsky's rule-based linguistic theory. This method was unsuccessful, and since 2010, learning has been performed similarly to how humans learn languages through deep learning. The right and wrong answers to human questions are cleverly mixed requiring the instructor to pay sufficient attention. Considering Chinese literature education, the interpretation of the original text is not very helpful because of unclear limitations.Instead, when asked about background knowledge related to the original text, they tend to give high-accuracy answers. However, there are many wrong contents. About five trillion documents are needed for the LLM to work properly. The datalearned by Chat GPT and Bard are mainly documents recorded in English. It is difficult to collect sufficiently reliable data because of the low percentage of Korean documents. Therefore, false information is often communicated in a plausible manner. Although much data has been learned, data related to Chinese characters in Korean are very weak. There is also an automatic translation service for the test version of the Korean Classics Translation Institute, but other text interpretations are low in accuracy because learning is limited to Seungjeongwon ilgi and Astronomical Classics.

Ten corn field images were captured by a UAV over approximately two weeks, during which gestating sows were allowed to graze freely on the corn field measuring 100 × 50 m2. The images were corrected to a bird’s-eye view, and then divided into 32 segments and sequentially inputted into the YOLOv4 detector to detect the corn images according to their condition. The 43 raw training images selected randomly out of 320 segmented images were flipped to create 86 images, and then these images were further augmented by rotating them in 5-degree increments to create a total of 6,192 images. The increased 6,192 images are further augmented by applying three random color transformations to each image, resulting in 24,768 datasets. The occupancy rate of corn in the field was estimated efficiently using You Only Look Once (YOLO). As of the first day of observation (day 2), it was evident that almost all the corn had disappeared by the ninth day. When grazing 20 sows in a 50 × 100 m2 cornfield (250 m2/sow), it appears that the animals should be rotated to other grazing areas to protect the cover crop after at least five days. In agricultural technology, most of the research using machine and deep learning is related to the detection of fruits and pests, and research on other application fields is needed. In addition, large-scale image data collected by experts in the field are required as training data to apply deep learning. If the data required for deep learning is insufficient, a large number of data augmentation is required."

Over the past 20 years, many fiducial marker designs and detection algorithms have been proposed to improve detection rates, broaden the same marker family, or save computational resources. However, most of these algorithms work well in constrained environments, such as well-lit conditions, minimal motion blur, or no shadows. These limitations can be addressed by using learning-based methods, but they often suffer from high computational loads or the need for collecting training datasets. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel fiducial marker detection algorithm along with a neural network compression. By using a feature detection network with a simple circular-shape based fiducial marker, training datasets can be fully synthesized considering real-world noise without the effort of collecting and labeling datasets. Since many fiducial marker applications run on computationally constrained embedded systems, TD (Tensor Decomposition) and QAT (Quantization Aware Training) are applied to the neural network to reduce the number of parameters and improve the inference speed of the network. We demonstrate that our neural network compression approach preserves overall performance while reducing network parameters by 55.48% and accelerating inference speed by 569% on an NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX. Furthermore, we validate our methods by testing them on real-world images taken by a flying drone."

Improvements of RL algorithms and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications technologies are creating new prospects to achieve better traffic efficiency. This paper proposes a new method, namely Vehicle-to-Infrastructure based Traffic Signal Control (V2I-TSC), to capture realistic traffic state using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications under 5G-NR-V2X paradigm. It uses single agent RL framework to optimize a traffic signal control which is trained and evaluated through Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) simulator. The experimental results show that our proposed method enhances traffic efficiency at the intersection compared to the general traffic control method."

However, if the recommendation is not suitable, there is a risk that it may reduce the purchase intention of the customer and even extend to a huge financial loss due to the characteristics of the financial product. Therefore, developing a recommender system that comprehensively reflects customer characteristics and product preferences is very important for business performance creation and response to compliance issues. In the case of financial products, product preference is clearly divided according to individual investment propensity and risk aversion, so it is necessary to provide customized recommendation service by utilizing accumulated customer data.In addition to using these customer behavioral characteristics and transaction history data, we intend to solve the cold-start problem of the recommender system, including customer demographic information, asset information, and stock holding information. Therefore, this study found that the model proposed deep learning-based collaborative filtering by deriving customer latent preferences through characteristic information such as customer investment propensity, transaction history, and financial product information based on customer transaction log records was the best. Based on the customer's financial investment mechanism, this study is meaningful in developing a service that recommends a high-priority group by establishing a recommendation model that derives expected preferences for untraded financial products through financial product transaction data."

Users require high object tracking accuracy as well as high QoS according to fast object tracking speed. In this study, we improve the object tracking speed of CSWinTT(transformer-based object-tracking model), which is currently considered as the best object tracking solution. The head operations of the Multi-Head Attention(MHA) in the encoder layer of this model occupy the most execution time in the entire inference procedure of the transformer. Each head has a different input value, but is executed in a serial manner. To overcome this, in this study, each head operation is executed in parallel. For parallel operation, the MHA consisting of one module is divided into sub-modules by the number of heads, and each separated sub-module is executed in a multi-threading environment. The pure Python environment does not guarantee a complete multi-threaded run. We thus improve to a C++ implementation environment to enable complete multi-threading. In addition, kernels transmitted asynchronously by each thread can be executed as concurrently as possible inside the GPU. As a result of checking the effect of MHA parallel execution through various experiments, the average execution time of the encoder decreased by 56.8% and the average FPS increased by 63.3% compared to the existing method while maintaining almost the same inference accuracy."

In thisstudy, we aimed to distinguish AD from CN with dual-phase 18F-Florbetaben (FBB) via a deep learning–based attentionmethod and evaluate the AD positivity scores compared to late-phase FBB which is currently adopted for AD diagnosis.Materials and Methods A total of 264 patients (74 CN and 190 AD), who underwent FBB imaging test and neuropsychologicaltests, were retrospectively analyzed. Early- and delay-phase FBB images were spatially normalized with an in-houseFBB template. The regional standard uptake value ratios were calculated with the cerebellar region as a reference regionand used as independent variables that predict the diagnostic label assigned to the raw image.Results AD positivity scores estimated from dual-phase FBB showed better accuracy (ACC) and area under the receiveroperating characteristic curve (AUROC) for AD detection (ACC: 0.858, AUROC: 0.831) than those from delay phase FBBimaging (ACC: 0.821, AUROC: 0.794). AD positivity score estimated by dual-phase FBB (R: −0.5412) shows a highercorrelation with psychological test compared to only dFBB (R: −0.2975). In the relevance analysis, we observed that LSTMuses different time and regions of early-phase FBB for each disease group for AD detection.Conclusions These results show that the aggregated model with dual-phase FBB with long short-term memory and attentionmechanism can be used to provide a more accurate AD positivity score, which shows a closer association with AD, than theprediction with only a single phase FBB."

From the perspective of the theory of human nature, the establishment of the concept of ‘Li’ as a universal and immutable basis for moral practice in ChengZhu was influenced by the ‘Buddha nature’ represented by the dharma realm of Li(理法界) and the Budda nature as ideal(理性). While we can see conceptual similarities between Buddha nature and Li, Yichuan's ‘One principal’(理一) has a different meaning from Buddhism in that it refers to an embodied morality of humanity. Next, Zhu-za interprets ‘One principle and Numerous manifestations(理一分殊) in terms of Buddhism's ’the moon reflects thousands of rivers’(月映萬川), which emphasizes the absolute and indivisible unity of the substance(本體), something that both the original Moon and One principal can share. However, they are at odds from a fractional point of view, as Buddhism understands the phenomenal world, which the Moon illuminates in all waters, as the dependent arising(緣起) without any own-being, whereas the Zhu-za understands individual objects as having physically endowed nature and actually existing. On the other hand, in the practical theory, this paper examined the relationship between ChengZhu and Buddhism in two ways. First, the idea that ‘sainthood can be attained’ from the thought of Budda nature by Chu, Dao-Sheng(竺道生) influenced the practical theory of ChengZhu, but the spirit of ‘sainthood can be learned’ is inherent in the Confucian thought itself. Second, in terms of the practice of sainthood, the ChengZhu opposed the sudden enlightenment(頓悟) of Zen and advocated ‘studying deep into the root of matter’(格物), but their strong sense of criticism did not go so far as to deny the enlightenment that can be attained through the sudden enlightenment and studying deep into the root of matter."

GNSS NLOS Signal Classifier with Successive Correlation Outputs using CNN,2023,"['GNSS', 'multipath', 'NLOS', 'CNN']",,"The problem of classifying a non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signal in a multipath channel is important to improve global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning accuracy in urban areas. Conventional deep learning-based NLOS signal classifiers use GNSS satellite measurements such as the carrier-to-noise-density ratio (CN_0), pseudorange, and elevation angle as inputs. However, there is a computational inefficiency with use of these measurements and the NLOS signal features expressed by the measurements are limited. In this paper, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based NLOS signal classifier that receives successive Auto-correlation function (ACF) outputs according to a time-series, which is the most primitive output of GNSS signal processing. We compared the proposed classifier to other DL-based NLOS signal classifiers such as a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to show the superiority of the proposed classifier. The results show the proposed classifier does not require the navigation data extraction stage to classify the NLOS signals, and it has been verified that it has the best detection performance among all compared classifiers, with an accuracy of up to 97%."

However, vision information has a disadvantage in that a lot of information disappears in a low-light environment. To overcome the problem, we propose an image enhancement method to perform visual SLAM in a low-light environment. Using the deep generative adversarial models and modified gamma correction, the quality of low-light images were improved. The proposed method is less sharp than the existing method, but it can be applied to ORB-SLAM in real time by dramatically reducing the amount of computation. The experimental results were able to prove the validity of the proposed method by applying to public Dataset TUM and VIVID++."

Four models, U-Net, U-Net++, DeepLabv3+, and M-Net were trained and compared using 1000 X-ray images, and key-points were derived using Douglas-Peucker algorithms. For evaluation, Dice Sim- ilarity Coefficient(DSC), Intersection over Union(IoU), precision, recall, and area under precision-recall curve eval- uation metrics were used and U-Net++ showed the best performance in all metrics with an average DSC of 0.9724.For the average Euclidean distance between estimated key-points and ground truth, U-Net was the best, followed by U-Net++. However the difference in average distance was about 0.1 pixels, which is not significant. The results suggest that it is possible to extract key-points based on segmentation and that it can be used to accurately diagnose various spinal diseases, including spondylolisthesis, with consistent criteria."

Improving Classification Performance in Gastric Disease through Realistic Data Augmentation Technique Based on Poisson Blending,2023,"['Computer-aided diagnosis systems', 'Data augmentation', 'Gastroscopy', 'Poisson blending']",,"Gastric cancer ranks fifth in incidence and fourth in mortality worldwide; thus, regular gastroscopies are necessary to reduce its incidence and mortality rates. However, diagnosing early-stage gastric cancer is challenging owing to subtle changes in the mucosa. Therefore, this study proposes a deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis system (CADx). CADx, trained using EfficientNetV2, can distinguish early-stage gastric cancer as abnormal for its diagnosis, thereby providing additional opinions to specialists and reducing misdiagnosis rates. The quality and quantity of the training data influence the performance of CADx. However, collecting medical data is challenging as it requires obtaining patient and Institutional Review Board approval. Therefore, this study proposes a data-augmentation technique that synthesizes abnormal and normal endoscopic images using Poisson blending. The proposed method is compared with the previously used cut-and-paste method; evidently, the proposed method produces realistic images. The model trained using the proposed method exhibits a sensitivity and F1-score of 0.917 and 0.948 for classifying abnormal and normal cases and 0.823 and 0.823 for classifying early gastric cancer, abnormal, and normal cases, respectively. The proposed method exhibits approximately 30% improvement in performance compared with the models trained using the original dataset, thus demonstrating its effectiveness in endoscopic classification."
Inpainting GAN-Based Image Blending with Adaptive Binary Line Mask,2023,"['Image Blending', 'Image Inpainting', 'Composite Image', 'Generative Adversarial Network.']",,"Image blending is a scheme for image composition to make the composite image looks as natural and realistic as possible. Image blending should ensure that the edges of the object look seamless and do not distort colors. Recently, numerous studies investigated image blending methods adopting deep learning-based image processing algorithms and contributed to generating natural blended images. Although the previ-ous studies show remarkable performance in many cases, they suffer from quality drop when blending incompletely cropped object. This is because partial loss and unnecessary extra information on the cropped object image interferes with image blending. This paper proposes a new scheme that significantly reduce the unnatural edges and the color distortion. First, to detect and handle the incompletely cropped region, an adaptive binary line mask generation utilizing color difference checking algorithm (CDC) is proposed. The generated mask is exploited to im-prove image blending performance by isolating incompletely cropped image edges from image blending. Second, in order to perform inpaint-ing the missing or masked area of the object image and image blending together, the inpainting generative adversarial model is adopted. Exper-imental results show that the blended images are not only more natural than those of the previous works but the color information is also well preserved."

Most algorithms for managing the SSD write buffer use past reference information such as LRU (Least Recently Used) or predict the future reference using deep learning with high computation cost. In this paper, we propose a technique for managing write buffers by efficiently predicting future reference patterns with a reasonable computation overhead using machine learning. If the future reuse distance, which means when the same data is re-referenced, is greater than the write buffer size, a strategy of directly flushing it in the flash memory without storing it in the buffer is used. However, since it is impossible to accurately predict the future reuse distance and is not essential for buffer management, we first group the future reuse distance into several levels considering the size of the write buffer. Then, a priority-based buffer management policy is proposed by taking the grouped future reuse distance as a priority for caching. As a result of the simulation, the proposed method showed a performance close to the optimal Belady's algorithm in terms of hit rate, while showing significant performance improvement compared to the existing LRU-based algorithm."

However, limited research exists on the factors influencing consumer choices regarding webtoons. Previous studies have predominantly focused on functional platform characteristics (e.g., comments and likes), while overlooking the significance of thumbnails. Advancements in deep learning-based computer vision technology have opened opportunities to extract and analyze visual features from computer graphics elements, including thumbnails. This study addresses the research gap by extracting visual features from webtoon thumbnails and investigating their impact on webtoon selection. Drawing from a comprehensive literature review, this research identifies brightness, saturation, color diversity, and visual complexity as potential visual features influencing consumer behavior. By quantifying the features of thumbnails in a sample of 1,953 webtoons, researchers employed negative binary regression analysis to verify the influence of each variable. The results indicate that brightness and saturation of thumbnails did not exert a statistically significant effect on webtoon consumers' choices, whereas color diversity and visual complexity demonstrated a statistically significant impact. The study advances the theoretical understanding of webtoon research by incorporating quantitative image analysis and fills the gap in the existing literature. Furthermore, it offers practical implications for webtoon writers and platform operators seeking to optimize their content to attract and engage consumers. This research contributes to the evolving methodology in webtoon and thumbnail studies and encourages further investigation into the visual features influencing consumer selections in the rapidly expanding webtoon industry."

The traditional techniques for predictive maintenance involved managing upper/lower thresholds (Set-Point) of equipment signals or identifying anomalies through control charts. Recently, with the development of techniques for big analysis, machine learning-based AAKR (Auto-Associative Kernel Regression) and deep learning-based VAE (Variation Auto-Encoder) techniques are being actively applied for predictive maintenance. However, this predictive maintenance techniques is only effective during steady-state operation of plant equipment, and it is difficult to apply them during start-up and shutdown periods when rises or falls. In addition, unlike processes such as nuclear and thermal power plants, which operate for hundreds of days after a single start-up, because the pumped power plant involves repeated start-ups and shutdowns 4-5 times a day, it is needed the prediction and alarm algorithm suitable for its characteristics. In this study, we aim to propose an approach to apply the optimal predictive alarm algorithm that is suitable for the characteristics of Pumped Storage Power Plant(PSPP) facilities to the system by analyzing the predictive maintenance techniques used in existing nuclear and coal power plants."
RAG-PaDiM: Residual Attention Guided PaDiM for Defects Segmentation in Railway Tracks,2023,"['Railway tracks', 'Defects segmentation', 'PaDiM', 'Attention gate', 'Residual connection']",,"Railway tracks are facilities for trains that can efficiently transport large-scale objects and it is inevitable to occur track defects that threaten the safety of train operation. Therefore, an inspection of track defects is essential to prevent large-scale accidents caused by anomaly events such as abrasion, fatigue, and deformation. In recent years, Deep Learning-based strategies for robust and highly accurate defect detection have been proposed to replace methods depending on the subjectivity and expertise of inspectors. However, the diversity of abnormal types and the rarity of defective samples make accurate segmentation of defect regions challenging. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a one-class classification algorithm called Residual Attention Guided PaDiM (RAG-PaDiM) for the segmentation of defects in railway tracks. First, the Residual Attention Guided U-Net, which is used as a backbone for generating embedding vectors in RAG-PaDiM, minimizes loss of information using residual connections and gives large weights to the regions of interest through an attention gate. Finally, the distribution of the normal data calculated by learning the training data consisting of only normal samples is used together with the Mahalanobis distance in the test phase to output the anomaly score. The proposed model was rigorously evaluated using the publicly available benchmark dataset, Rail Surface Defect Datasets (RSDD). Experimental results show that the proposed model correctly segmented the pixel-level area under the curve score by about 98.5% for defects in RSDD, suggesting that the proposed method improved the performance in the defect segmentation task for the railway track."

High-resolution satellite and aerial images can be used, but continuous image acquisition is problematic due to economic burden. Therefore, a solution is proposed to improve the resolution of images by applying deep learning-based super-resolution technology to remote-sensing images that are relatively easy to acquire. In this study, to increase detection reliability even for small objects, the resolution of drone images that can secure high resolution and economic efficiency was improved through super-resolution. This study used EDSR (Enhanced Deep Residual Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution) and SRGAN (Super Resolution GAN) models that showed good performance in various benchmarks were used, and the training dataset was acquired using drones and camera equipment owned by the KICT (Korea Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology), then produced directly and used for experiments. Quality evaluation of the final result was performed using PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index). As a result of the experiment, EDSR was found to have a PSNR value of 34.24dB and an SSIM value of 0.938, and SRGAN was found to have 36.63dB and 0.954, respectively, showing that SRGAN had the best performance. The values obtained are higher than those cited in the benchmark, which is attributed to the super-resolution training data produced by KICT, providing suitable information for the neural network model. The outcomes of this study are considered to be of sufficient quality for application in subsequent research aimed at enhancing detection and recognition rates."
Automatic Detection of Type II Solar Radio Burst by Using 1-D Convolution Neutral Network,2023,"['Sun: radio radiation', 'shock waves', 'methods: observational', 'techniques: image processing', 'radio continuum: transients']",,"Type II solar radio bursts show frequency drifts from high to low over time. They have been known as a signature of coronal shock associated with Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and/or flares, which cause an abrupt change in the space environment near the Earth (space weather). Therefore, early detection of type II bursts is important for forecasting of space weather. In this study, we develop a deep-learning (DL) model for the automatic detection of type II bursts. For this purpose, we adopted a 1-D Convolution Neutral Network (CNN) as it is well-suited for processing spatiotemporal information within the applied data set. We utilized a total of 286 radio burst spectrum images obtained by Hiraiso Radio Spectrograph (HiRAS) from 1991 and 2012, along with 231 spectrum images without the bursts from 2009 to 2015, to recognizes type II bursts. The burst types were labeled manually according to their spectra features in an answer table. Subsequently, we applied the 1-D CNN technique to the spectrum images using two filter windows with different size along time axis. To develop the DL model, we randomly selected 412 spectrum images (80%) for training and validation. The train history shows that both train and validation losses drop rapidly, while train and validation accuracies increased within approximately 100 epoches. For evaluation of the model's performance, we used 105 test images (20%) and employed a contingence table. It is found that false alarm ratio (FAR) and critical success index (CSI) were 0.14 and 0.83, respectively. Furthermore, we confirmed above result by adopting five-fold cross-validation method, in which we re-sampled five groups randomly. The estimated mean FAR and CSI of the five groups were 0.05 and 0.87, respectively. For experimental purposes, we applied our proposed model to 85 HiRAS type II radio bursts listed in the NGDC catalogue from 2009 to 2016 and 184 quiet (no bursts) spectrum images before and after the type I bursts. As a result, our model successfully detected 79 events (93%) of type II events. This results demonstrates, for the first time, that the 1-D CNN algorithm is useful for detecting type II bursts."

Unlike past methods, NMT (Neural Network Machine Translation) employs deep-learning methods. Thus, translation quality hinges on the amount of data in NMT. As translation quality will increase with the accumulation of data, artificial NMT is expected to continue improving at a fairly rapid pace. Compared to other language pairs, the Korean-Japanese pair often produces high quality translations since the two languages have quite similar syntactic structures and Chinese characters. Today, Artificial Intelligence identifies the context of the original text and draws appropriate expressions from accumulated corpus data.This study stemmed from the question of 'When translating synonyms, can MT (Machine Translation) recognize a situation and context and select appropriate expressions among synonyms?' The dictionary definition of synonyms is 'words with similar meaning', and even if the meanings are almost the same or similar, each word must be clearly distinguished according to the situation or context. When human translation is performed, professional translators are capable of selecting appropriate words suitable for the context and situation. Although translation quality has improved significantly due to the NMT, this paper aims to verify the ability of the machine to accurately recognize the situation and context in which the word is used. In this paper, by using a neural machine translation program, Naver's Papago, to translate six pairs of representative synonyms (Japanese) in both directions of Korean-Japanese and Japanese-Korean, we have confirmed that the neural machine translation system can recognize some degree of scenes and contexts through words in a sentence and lead to appropriate lexical selection."

This paper showcases CASETiFY by spotlighting the major factors that led the brand to success. We do so by deep-diving into CASETiFY’s various projects and initiatives and identifying three crucial phases in its history–the Value Creation phase, Value Communication phase, and Value Delivery phase. We highlight how, in each of these phases, CASETiFY leveraged on both the social aspects (e.g., brand communities, authentic brand messaging, providing a sense of belonging) and the individual aspects (e.g., self-expression, individualism) of its target consumers’ psyche to cultivate success factors such as intentional creativity, intensive branding, and the identification of consumers’ psychological needs. While extensive case studies exist on prominent tech companies, academic resources on peripheral accessories, a niche side of the tech industry, are limited.

순환신경망을 이용한 압력신호기반 벌크 트레일러의 분말 순간배출량 추정,2023,"['bulk trailer', 'instantaneous exhaust', 'automatic exhaust system', 'recurrent neural network', 'pressure sensors', 'flowmeter']",,"Bulk trailers are vehicles that are used for transporting powdered construction materials such as cement and fly ash. To ensure high transportation efficiency and low transportation costs, materials stored in the tank of bulk trailers must be quickly exhausted. One approach is to replace the existing manual exhaust operation with an automatic control system. For the development of an automatic control system for bulk trailers, measurement of the instantaneous exhaust of powdered materials is required. However, flowmeters for powders are expensive and also tricky to install on bulk trailers requiring a straight pipeline of a certain length or more. Therefore, in this paper, a deep learning-based method was proposed for estimating the instantaneous exhaust from the pressure signals of a bulk trailer without using a flowmeter. In the proposed method, a recurrent neural network (i.e., a long short-term memory network) is used to estimate the instantaneous exhaust of powder by using the pressure signals. For the training and validation of the proposed neural network, the signals from pressure sensors and flowmeter were collected during actual cement exhaust operations. The performance of the proposed method was experimentally validated: the normalized root mean square errors of instantaneous and accumulated exhausts were 9.29% and 3.32%, respectively. Thus, the results showed that the instantaneous exhaust information can be effectively estimated using low-cost pressure sensor signals instead of a flowmeter."

Adaptive High-order Variation De-noising Method for Edge Detection with Wavelet Coefficients,2023,"['Denoising', 'diffusion function', 'edge protection', 'high-order diffusion', 'state weight', 'wavelet transform']",,"This study discusses the high-order diffusion method in the wavelet domain. It aims to improve the edge protection capability of the high-order diffusion method using wavelet coefficients that can reflect image information. During the first step of the proposed diffusion method, the wavelet packet decomposition is a more refined decomposition method that can extract the texture and structure information of the image at different resolution levels. The high-frequency wavelet coefficients are then used to construct the edge detection function. Subsequently, because accurate wavelet coefficients can more accurately reflect the edges and details of the image information, by introducing the idea of state weight, a scheme for recovering wavelet coefficients is proposed. Finally, the edge detection function is constructed by the module of the wavelet coefficients to guide high-order diffusion, the denoised image is obtained. The experimental results showed that the method presented in this study improves the denoising ability of the high-order diffusion model, and the edge protection index (SSIM) outperforms the main methods, including the block matching and 3D collaborative filtering (BM3D) and the deep learning-based image processing methods.

In particular, this paper proposes that in order to effectively apply the deep learning-based method with high recognition performance, open competition through datasets for various challenging situations is necessary. If vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communication is standardized in the distant future, the importance of IPMS-based is expected to increase. In order to cope with this, this paper proposes that the commercialization and standardization of high-precision indoor positioning along with the standardization of vehicle to everything (V2X) communication are necessary."

Recently, as the size of deep-learning-based models employed in recommender systems has increased, many studies have focused on reducing inference time while maintaining high recommendation accuracy. As one of them, a study on recommender systems with a knowledge distillation (KD) technique is actively conducted. By KD, a small-sized model (i.e., student) is trained through knowledge extracted from a large-sized model (i.e., teacher), and then the trained student is used as a recommendation model. Existing studies on KD for recommender systems have been mainly performed only for implicit feedback settings. Thus, in this paper, we try to investigate the performance and accuracy when applied to explicit feedback settings. To this end, we leveraged a total of five state-of-the-art KD methods and three real-world datasets for recommender systems."
Application of AI-Based Models for Flood Water Level Forecasting and Flood Risk Classification,2023,"['Climate change', 'Flood forecasting and warning systems', 'Flood risk classification', 'Flood water level forecasting']",,"Owing to global climate change, the frequency of disasters has increased twelve-fold, with acorresponding approximately seventeen-fold increase in economic damages over the past sixdecades. Notably, severe flood damage has been occurring in Asia along the Pacific coast dueto extreme weather events, including torrential rains and typhoons, which have beenbecoming increasingly frequent and prolonging the rainy season. In the Eastern Visayas region,the management and monitoring facilities for flood observation data, as well as the forecastingand warning systems suitable for the local area, are insufficient. The warning system introducedthrough overseas grants is limited in operation in some areas of the city. Furthermore, althoughan organization has jurisdiction over flood forecasting and warning, the system's operation isnot systematic and is limited. Additionally, there is a shortage of technical manpower. In thisstudy, we utilized deep learning models to forecast flood water levels in the CarayCaray Basinon Biliran Island, located in Eastern Visayas, the Philippines. Additionally, a flood riskclassification was applied to evaluate the degree of risk associated with the predicted waterlevels. The predicted water levels for each model were compared with the observed waterlevel data. The evaluation of the predictive performance of each model resulted in an NRMSEvalue of 9.48. Moreover, the accuracy of the DNN model was found to be the best among theflood water level prediction models. To implement the flood risk classification, we utilizedextreme gradient boosting, random forest, and decision tree models. The application of thesemodels resulted in an F1-score of 0.92 for the extreme gradient boost model, which exhibitedthe highest accuracy. With an increasing need for disaster (flood) management, AI-basedpredictive models are anticipated to reduce the damage caused by natural disasters andenhance disaster mitigation systems. Real-time collection of rainfall and water level dataenables continuous learning. Furthermore, if a clear flood warning based on learned floodlevel patterns is issued, preemptive measures can be taken before intense flood damageoccurs."
Channel Prediction Based on Non-Uniform Pilot Pattern for Mobile Massive MIMO Scenarios,2023,"['Channel aging', 'channel prediction', 'compressive sensing', 'massive MIMO', 'matrix completion.']",,"Massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) isa broadly used technique that can provide numerous gains inspectral efficiency. However, the degradation of beamformingperformance due to outdated channel state information at thetransmitter side (CSIT) induced by the mobility of users hasbeen a significant problem waiting to be solved. It is reported thatsystem performance will decrease 50 percent even in a moderate30 km/h speed scenario. However, the CSI cannot be simplyreconstructed through interpolation in high mobility scenariosdue to the limitation of pilot density — the phenomenon is knownas “Doppler aliasing”. To address this, we propose a novel non-uniform pilot pattern that can provide more spectrum resolutioncompared with the uniform pilot currently used in most commu-nication protocols. Meanwhile, we maintain the density of pilotsin order not to sacrifice the payload resources. Based on the novelpilot setting, we propose two-channel prediction schemes withcompressive sensing and matrix completion methods. Simulationresults show our scheme can outperform deep learning-based andauto-regressive-based methods for about 15 percent in terms ofaverage throughput in the simulated channel generated from theCOST2100 channel model. To further verify the applicability,we apply our schemes in real channels measured from a channelsounding campaign, the proposed methods also achieve 5 percentgain which validates their superiority over conventional methods."

This technology has evolved through the use of deep-learning algorithms and extensive datasets, leading to revolutionary changes in various fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. However, with the advancement of generative AI, ethical issues have emerged, particularly the phenomenon of “hallucination.” Hallucination in generative AI occurs when the technology generates content that blurs the boundaries between reality and virtuality, potentially leading to the acceptance of false information as truth. This study primarily aimed to comprehend and analyze hallucination in generative AI and elucidate its mechanism and impact. Additionally, this study aimed to identify ethical challenges associated with this phenomenon and provide possible solutions. This study also explored the ethical perspective of using and developing generative AI and proposed topics relevant to AI ethics education for elementary-school students. The proposed topics are essential for teaching elementary-school students about ethical issues surrounding AI and its responsible use and include the following: data privacy, bias and fairness, transparency and accountability, reliance on generative AI content, emotional manipulation, critical thinking, impact on creative activities, ethical guidelines for AI content, plagiarism, and reliability. These topics can be addressed in elementary AI ethics education, thereby contributing to students’ AI literacy, critical thinking skills, and ethical awareness.Through these discussions, considerations for the safe development and use of AI and ethics can be incorporated into future AI research, design, development, and deployment.

In addition, Buddhist philosophy and ideology are worth jointly and valued by the people of the two countries, and the happiness of the people of the two countries should be achieved by uplifting and developing excellent traditions.As a religion, illegalism has a profound philosophical thought, and as a philosophy, illegalism contains intense religious sentiment. This means that the meaning of illegality and reason are expressed in terms of theory and theory, but at the same time there is a part that goes beyond theory and theory. This is why illegal law can not be seen simply as knowledge or scholarship, and should not be the same as a study of general philosophy or social science.The philosophy of Buddhism is deep and delicate, so it is simple to say, but the law is wide and deeBuddhist philosophy can not know the intrinsic deep meaning unless it is learned by heart.

In order to trace the Christian significance of the material “death,” which seems unfamiliar to the close relationship between art and beauty, this work examines the examples of art in the Bible, catacombe art in the early church, the Middle ages, and the art of the Renaissance. The Background to analyze the genre of Dutch “vanitas still life paintings” by Reformation artists, will provide following in the footsteps of the themes such as the passion and death of Jesus Christ, the suffering and death of martyrs, hell and judgment, Satan and monsters, and sorrow and vanity. Vanitas still life painting depicts the “vanity and emptiness” of Ecclesiastes with withered flowers, everyday tables, skeletons, and animal carcasses, and is full of symbolic meaning to see “grace” inherent in daily life and to have “hope of resurrection.” In this regard, this study tried to understand the artistic language left by vanitas painters and to inform its value through Christ-centered deep meditation derived from the theme of death by today’s Christians. Focusing on the works of masters who struggled to incorporate the theology and spirituality of Protestantism into everyday paintings, this work questions what the life of the body should be like for the splendid glory of salvation through paintings, and invites us to realize the power of the unique “blood of Christ” that can reach the eternal God through “death and futility,” and important topic for Christians to learn."
Advancing Patient Care: Innovative Use of Near-Infrared  Spectroscopy for Monitoring Urine Volume in Neurogenic  Bladder,2023,"['Neurogenic bladder', 'Clean intermittent catheterization', 'Bladder monitoring']",,"Purpose: Current guidelines recommend clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) at regular time intervals for patients with spinal cord injuries; however, many patients experience difficulties. Performing time-based CIC outside the home is a significant burden for patients. In this study, we aimed to overcome the limitations of the current guidelines by developing a digital device to monitor bladder urine volume in real-time.Methods: The optode sensor is a near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-based wearable device intended to be attached to the skin of the lower abdomen where the bladder is located. The sensor’s primary function is to detect changes in urine volume within the bladder. An in vitro study was conducted using a bladder phantom that mimicked the optical properties of the lower abdomen. To validate the data in the human body at the proof-of-concept level, one volunteer attached the device to the lower abdomen to measure the light intensity between the first voiding and immediately before the second voiding.Results: The degree of attenuation at the maximum test volume was equivalent across experiments, and the optode sensor with multiplex measurements demonstrated robust performance for patient diversity. Moreover, the symmetric feature of the matrix was deemed a potential parameter for identifying the accuracy of sensor localization in a deep-learning model. The validated feasibility of the sensor showed almost the same results as an ultrasound scanner, which is routinely used in the clinical field.Conclusions: The optode sensor of the NIRS-based wearable device can measure the urine volume in the bladder in real-time."
시계열 예측 모델을 활용한 암호화폐 투자 전략 개발,2023,"['Cryptocurrency', 'Time series Analysis', 'Price forecasting', 'Trading Strategy']",,"This study endeavors to enrich investment prospects in cryptocurrency by establishing a rationale for investment decisions. The primary objective involves evaluating the predictability of four prominent cryptocurrencies – Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and EOS – and scrutinizing the efficacy of trading strategies developed based on the prediction model. To identify the most effective prediction model for each cryptocurrency annually, we employed three methodologies – AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Prophet – representing traditional statistics and artificial intelligence. These methods were applied across diverse periods and time intervals. The result suggested that Prophet trained on the previous 28 days' price history at 15-minute intervals generally yielded the highest performance. The results were validated through a random selection of 100 days (20 target dates per year) spanning from January 1st, 2018, to December 31st, 2022. The trading strategies were formulated based on the optimal-performing prediction model, grounded in the simple principle of assigning greater weight to more predictable assets. When the forecasting model indicates an upward trend, it is recommended to acquire the cryptocurrency with the investment amount determined by its performance. Experimental results consistently demon- strated that the proposed trading strategy yields higher returns compared to an equal portfolio employing a buy-and-hold strategy. The cryptocurrency trading model introduced in this paper carries two significant implications. Firstly, it facilitates the evolution of cryptocurrencies from speculative assets to investment instruments.

In the midst of these transformations, brands are faced with the necessity to explore new design approaches that align with the values and demands of the AI era. Specifically, the potential utilization of image-generating AI programs in the branding field has been actively discussed, as they possess the capability to efficiently generate the desired extended brand identity through active deep learning.This research conducted a literature review and case study to ascertain the development status and limitations of existing logo platform AI and to explore the potential contribution of generative AI to brand identity development. The researcher conducted an experiment in brand identity creation, establishing a fictional brand based on the generative AI platform, Midjourney, and examined how AI can be effectively utilized in the process of brand identity creation. The findings revealed that generative AI can rapidly and efficiently generate a diverse range of logo prototypes in the realm of brand design, and produce high-quality images in the extended identity domain, encompassing various application designs. However, it should be noted that the results produced by AI are contingent upon the designer’s choice of keywords. Thus, designers must possess a clear understanding of the brand concept and use AI as a supplementary tool to experiment with their ideas, rather than relying on it as a sole production tool.This study is expected to provide insights into the methodological possibilities for creating brand identities using AI in the future."

Leakage can potentially occur and cause immediate economic and hydraulic damage upon occurrence. Therefore, leakage detection is essential, but WDSs are located underground, it is difficult. Moreover, when multiple leakage occurs, it is required to prioritize restoration according to the scale and location of the leakage, applying for an optimal restoration framework can be advantageous in terms of system resilience. In this study, various leakage scenarios were generated based on the WDSs hydraulic model, and leakage detection was carried out containing location and scale using a Deep learning-based model. Finally, the leakage location and scale obtained from the detection results were used as a factor for the priority of leakage restoration, and the results of the priority of leakage restoration were derived. The priority of leakage restoration considered not only hydraulic factors but also socio-economic factors (e.g., leakage scale, important facilities)."
Turbulent-image Restoration Based on a Compound Multibranch Feature Fusion Network,2023,"['Attention mechanism', 'Compound multi-branch', 'Efficient channel attention', 'Turbulence image restoration']",,"In middle- and long-distance imaging systems, due to the atmospheric turbulence caused by temperature, wind speed, humidity, and so on, light waves propagating in the air are distorted, resulting in image-quality degradation such as geometric deformation and fuzziness. In remote sensing, astronomical observation, and traffic monitoring, image information loss due to degradation causes huge losses, so effective restoration of degraded images is very important. To restore images degraded by atmospheric turbulence, an image-restoration method based on improved compound multibranch feature fusion (CMFNetPro) was proposed. Based on the CMFNet network, an efficient channel-attention mechanism was used to replace the channel-attention mechanism to improve image quality and network efficiency. In the experiment, two-dimensional random distortion vector fields were used to construct two turbulent datasets with different degrees of distortion, based on the Google Landmarks Dataset v2 dataset. The experimental results showed that compared to the CMFNet, DeblurGAN-v2, and MIMO-UNet models, the proposed CMFNetPro network achieves better performance in both quality and training cost of turbulent-image restoration. In the mixed training, CMFNetPro was 1.2391 dB (weak turbulence), 0.8602 dB (strong turbulence) respectively higher in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio and 0.0015 (weak turbulence), 0.0136 (strong turbulence) respectively higher in terms of structure similarity compared to CMFNet. CMFNetPro was 14.4 hours faster compared to the CMFNet. This provides a feasible scheme for turbulent-image restoration based on deep learning."

Previous studies indicate that AI-based design automation techniques can be used to design the paradigm of the existing construction and design field, thus improving the construction productivity. In this study, we have conducted additional research to understand the application of generative design in the planning and initial design stages of buildings to provide research directions for Korean design automation and generative design suitable for domestic situations. Method: We have used Autodesks Revit and Dynamo programs to generate alternatives using generative design techniques. Dynamo is a visual coding program and is used in conjunction with Revit. First, problems associated with attribute classification and methodology are defined. Then, a grid is formed in an arbitrary site. Result: Based on the layout design, we have identified three evaluation methodologies, namely building coverage ratio, ratio of the width and length of the building, and number of buildings. In addition, we have created a layout design plan with an optimal alternative. In the future, numerous alternatives can be generated in the conceptual and detailed design stages through additional algorithm modifications and the application of deep learning-based machine learning technologies.

Diverse viewpoints exist for analyzing the causes and effects of this issue. This study seeks to examine research trends related to policy responses to low fertility discussed in academic circles from 2005 to 2022. To achieve this, 373 abstracts from papers featuring the keyword ""low birth rate"" in their titles or keywords were chosen from academic journals categorized under the ""Social Sciences"" in the Korean Citation Index (KCI). These abstracts underwent analysis using BERTopic, a deep learning-based topic modeling method. The analysis identified 16 distinct research topics encompassing administrative and policy implications. The findings indicate that the discourse surrounding current policy responses to low fertility has mainly focused on causal analysis and outcome evaluation, predominantly considering demographic and socio-economic factors. Furthermore, this discourse has engaged not only experts but also included subjective assessments from policy beneficiaries. However, the study identified a limitation in comprehensively evaluating both the process and outcomes in relation to low birth rate response policies. By analyzing research trends in studies centered on policy responses to low fertility, this study provides a policy implication that underscores the need for a comprehensive approach. This approach should address not only the structural issues intrinsic to South Korea's low birth rate problem but also trigger shifts in societal awareness."

Mixed Precision 기반 CNN 추론 연산의 구현 및 성능 분석,2023,"['deep learning', 'embedded system', 'mixed precision', 'quantization/dequantization', '.']",,"Recently, deep learning technology has increased accuracy due to high-precision models, but resource consumption and processing time required for deep learning operation increase due to the increase in the number of parameters and the depth of complex networks. Such network complexity becomes an overhead for performing deep learning operations in embedded systems such as IoT systems and mobile systems. A lot of research on lightweighting for deep learning models suitable for systems such as quantization has been made. However, since accuracy loss occurs when quantization is applied, mixed precision application that uses mixed parameters is becoming an alternative. In this paper, we implemented an inference operation method of a CNN deep learning model based on Mixed Precision for embedded system, and analyzed the performance of Mixed Precision-based inference of CNN model. As a result of the experiment, it is identified that the inference time can be much reduced with little loss of accuracy with mixed precision when quantization is applied to only few layers with high computational complexity."

In this paper, we investigated examples of binary-class classification and multi-class classification of cancer cell image data of commonly occurring types of cancer worldwide, such as cervical cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, and colon cancer, using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) models. For instance, some studies explored the utilization of transfer learning, leveraging a pre-trained CNN model is used as a starting point for additional training on a specific cancer cell dataset. Cancer cells have irregular and abnormal growth, making accurate classification challenging. The application of deep learning techniques, such as CNN, for cancer cell classification has been able to solve these complex analysis problems and enable fast cancer cell classification results, leading to early detection of cancer. Indeed, most of the studies in this paper achieved high performance using CNN models, and this approach enables faster and more accurate confirmation of cancer cell classification results, leading to early detection of cancer. This shows the current trend of applying deep learning in the application of cancer cell classification and demonstrates the significant potential of deep learning to contribute to cancer research. Overall, we provide an overview of the current trend of applying deep learning in the field of cancer cell classification and expect that deep learning will open the way for more effective cancer diagnosis and treatment in the future."

We then used Google's Teachable Machine to confirm the degree of deep learning video data recognition.Result: The research and technology related to dance movement recognition are mostly led by overseas researchers and artists. However, through deep learning tools such as Teachable Machine and OpenPose, it is possible to extract skeleton data from Korean traditional dance videos. The requirements for extracting skeleton data of dancers from Korean traditional dance videos were identified, with the screen background and props being found to have no significant impact. However, the wearing of masks can interfere with facial recognition, and the number of dancers and their costumes were also found to be factors affecting data extraction.Conclusion: To extract skeleton data from Korean traditional dance videos, it is important to have a good understanding of the characteristics of Korean traditional dance and deep learning tools, and to utilize them effectively. Therefore, when selecting types of Korean traditional dance for data extraction, it is recommended to choose solo dances where pants are worn and dances where masks are not worn, as these are expected to provide the highest accuracy in data extraction"

In this respect, Moniz and Jong(2014) had studied the effect of the monetary policy communication of the Bank of England on the future market interest rate expectation of the market participants using the economic sentiment analysis. In detail, they had extracted the monetary policy themes, relating to economic growth, inflation, and market interests, from the minutes of the monthly monetary policy meeting of the Bank of England, and they had also extracted the economic sentiment words, such as positive or negative words among those monetary policy themes. Then they had created the economic sentiment index using these words. And with these data, they predicted the market interest rate, such as forward interest rates, using the various prediction models. Finally, they showed that the market interest rate prediction using these data reflected the significant change in the future interest rates.This paper also tried to reveal the usefulness of the sentiment analysis for forecasting of the market interest rates, supposed that the market participants would predict the future market interest rates using those information. Therefore, based on the Moniz and Jong(2014)’s technique, we studied if Korean market interest rates in the future would properly reflect those economic sentiments. For this purpose, this study, firstly extracted five monetary policy themes from the press releases of the Bank of Korea relating to the monetary policy decision in the every month during the period of 15 years, using the text mining method of Park and Kim(2022). And secondly, we extracted economic sentiment words from each monetary policy themes and created each economic sentiment index. Lastly we forecasted the future interest rates of a Convertible Deposit(maturity of three months) and Treasury Bond rate(maturity of three years) in one month later just after the date of the monetary policy decision of the Bank of Korea. As a forecasting method, we used machine learning method, such as support vector machine and random forest, and a deep learning method using simple neural nets in addition to a general linear regression method. And we included the average of the above all predicted interest rates as a predicted data. For the test of forecasting power, we segregated the whole data into two parts. One part is 75% of the whole data for the training of machine learning and deep learning models, and the other is 25% of the whole data for the test of the forecasting power. As a result of this analysis, we found that the interest rate forecasting power were much higher when the economic sentiment information was included. Among the forecasting methods, the machine learning methods had much higher forecasting power. Especially the random forest method had the better forecasting power among all forecasting methods.

준지도 학습 모델을 사용한 차량 내부 네트워크에서의 이상 징후 탐지,2023,"['Cloud Storage', 'Client-Side Deduplication', 'Identification Attack', 'Data Deletion Process', 'Cloud Security']","현재 자동차 내부의 전자 제어 장치(Electronic Control Unit, ECU)간의 통신을 위해 CAN(Controller Area Network) 프로토콜을 많이 사용하고 있다. 하지만 CAN 프로토콜은 메시지 암호화 및 발신자 인증과 같은 보안 기능을 가지고 있지 않아 인가되지 않은 데이터 주입이나 서비스 거부 공격(Denial of Service, DoS) 등과 같은 사이버 보안위협에 취약하다. 따라서 최근에는 자동차의 CAN 네트워크를 보호하기 위한 인공 지능 기반의 침입 탐지 시스템(Intrusion Detection System, IDS)에 대한 연구가 활발하게 진행되고 있다. 본 논문에서는 먼저 CAN 버스의 데이터 트래픽에 대한 메시지 주입 공격을 탐지할 수 있는 지도 학습(supervised learning)을 사용하는 딥러닝 모델인 DCNN(Deep Convolutional Neural network) 기반의 이상 탐지 모델을 구현하였다. 또한, 지도 학습 모델은 학습용 데이터 셋이 많아야 한다는 한계점을 지적하고 이를 보완하기 위해 준지도 학습(semi-supervised learning)을 사용한 딥러닝 모델인 GAN(Generative Adversarial Network) 기반의 이상 탐지 모델을 제안한다. 제안하는 준지도 학습 기반의 이상 탐지 모델은 기존 지도 학습 모델에서 약 20만 개의 데이터로 학습하던 것을 1,000개의 데이터만으로도 서비스 거부 공격과 스푸핑 공격을 99%이상 탐지할 수 있어 효율적인 차량용 이상 징후 탐지 시스템으로 사용할 수 있다.","The CAN (Controller Area Network) protocol is used widely for communication between ECUs (Electronic Control Units) in a vehicle network. On the other hand, the CAN protocol is vulnerable to cyber security threats, such as unauthorized data injection and DoS (Denial of Service) attacks, because it does not have security functions, such as message encryption and sender authentication. Therefore, research on an artificial intelligence-based IDS (Intrusion Detection System) for protecting the CAN network has been actively conducted. This paper reports an anomaly detection model based on a DCNN (Deep Convolutional Neural Network), a deep learning model using supervised learning that can detect message injection attacks on data traffic on CAN buses. The supervised learning model requires a large number of training data sets. This paper proposes an anomaly detection model based on GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), a deep learning model using semi-supervised learning, to compensate for this advantage. The proposed anomaly detection model based on semi-supervised learning can be used as an efficient vehicle anomaly detection system because it can detect more than 99% of denial-of-service and spoofing attacks with only 1,000 data instead of learning with about 200,000 data in the existing supervised learning model."

This study investigated a novel task offloading strategy considering the probabilistic MEC environment to address these challenges. Initially, we considered the frequency of dynamic task requests and the unstable conditions of wireless channels to propose a method for minimizing vehicle power consumption and latency. Subsequently, our research delved into a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based offloading technique, offering a way to achieve equilibrium between local computation and offloading transmission power. We analyzed the power consumption and queuing latency of vehicles using the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and deep Q-network (DQN) techniques.

Data in the medical domain faces challenges such as anonymizing personal information and labeling cost issues, leading to research considering GAN(Generative Adversarial Networks)-based data synthesis and augmentation as a solution. Not only is data augmentation valuable, but tasks such as synthesizing CT images from MRI images, utilizing deep learning, prove useful in overcoming constraints imposed by the unique characteristics of medical images. Furthermore, deep learning has seen extensive application such as lesion Segmentation and Denoising in Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) images. DBT images excel in diagnosing cancer that may not be visible in traditional breast imaging methods. In this study, we develop a GAN-based model for synthesizing images from an imbalanced dataset of DBT (Digital Breast Tomosynthesis) images under un-paired conditions. To address the imbalance, a GAN model utilizing the Cycle-consistency concept is employed. For performance improvement, the generator's architecture combines the U-net structure, known for high performance in the medical domain, with Residual Blocks. The model's performance is evaluated quantitatively using metrics for the generated images, and a visual assessment is conducted. Anticipated is a positive impact on data augmentation for imbalanced medical datasets under un-paired conditions through such image synthesis models."

Hydrodynamic performances were evaluated for two small fishing vessels for the dataset of deep learning model. The deep learning model of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) which is one of the recurrent neural network was utilized. The input data of LSTM model consisted of time series of six(6) degrees of freedom motions and wave height and the output label was selected as the time series data of six(6) degrees of freedom motions. The hyperparameter and input window length studies were performed to optimize LSTM model. The time series motion response according to different wave direction was predicted by establised LSTM. The predicted time series motion response showed good overall agreement with the analysis results. As the length of the time series increased, differences between the predicted values and analysis results were increased, which is due to the reduced influence of long-term data in the training process. The overall error of the predicted data indicated that more than 85% of the data showed an error within 10%. The established LSTM model is expected to be utilized in monitoring and alarm systems for small fishing vessels."

This is particularly true in the dental field.Accordingly, we propose a method of generating dental images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). In this paper, we compare the performance of a Mask R-CNN model for image segmentation trained on a dataset that included GAN-generated data against a Mask R-CNN model trained with a dataset that did not include GAN-generated data.Ultimately, we observed improved performance by the Mask R-CNN that employed our GAN-generated images."

However, current object detection models are mainly performed with RGB images. Due to this direction of research, a separate study is underway for a model for IR image. Because of this, the development of deep learning models for IR images is much slower than RGB images. In addition, due to the lack of IR image data, research on IR image deep learning models is becoming more and more laggy compared to other deep learning studies. This paper proposes that the model trained on RGB images shows excellent performance in IR images. The object detection deep learning model learns shape information by using feature extraction. Our results show that IR images showing the shape of an object and images learned as RGB images can be sufficiently inferred. As a result, the model trained with RGB images shows robustness even in IR images."

To perform large-scale 3D reconstruction, a large number of images are required, and accurate camera intrinsics are necessary for precise 3D reconstruction. However, using expensive specialized equipment for camera calibration increases production costs. As an alternative, smartphones can be used to acquire video information, but there are difficulties in accurately estimating the camera intrinsics for each captured image. Conventional camera calibration uses a calibration object such as a checkerboard, and this process is very cumbersome, making it difficult to apply to a large amount of image data without additional steps such as using a checkerboard. Therefore, it is a very important research topic to estimate the focal length and distortion coefficients using only captured video information without additional steps, using a deep learning network. So far, the methods proposed by experts in this field have not shown satisfactory performance in terms of complexity and accuracy in calculating both the focal length and distortion coefficients using a deep learning network. In this paper, we propose a new cost function value for use in deep learning network training, designed to reflect the difference between predicted values and actual values.

The core of machine learning workload is model training, and model training is a computationally intensive task. Performing machine learning workloads in a Kubernetes-based cloud environment in which the computing framework and storage are separated can effectively allocate resources, but delays can occur because IO must be performed through network communication. In this paper, we propose a distributed in-memory caching technique to improve the performance of machine learning workloads performed in such an environment. In particular, we propose a new method of pre-caching data required for machine learning workloads into the distributed in-memory cache by considering Kubflow pipelines, a Kubernetes-based machine learning pipeline management tool."

We deep stack the encoder layers to accurately reflect the features of the image and apply residual blocks to solve the problems of deep layers to improve the encoder performance. This solves the problems of gradient vanishing and exploding, which are problems when constructing a deep neural network, and creates a 3D model of improved quality. To accurately extract image features, we construct deep layers of the encoder model and apply the residual function to learning to model with more detailed information.

This study examines the evolution of the role assumed by A.I.characters as a central element within the contemporary science fiction genre, spanning approximately three decades, specifically from 1993 to 2023. The analysis focuses on examining aspects of this change in terms of narrative features and interpreting the implications and rationale for these features from the perspective of the creators on Jacques Derrida’s concept of the Other as a framework for interpretation, this study explores how humans and non-humans (A.I. creatures) have been differentiated in science fiction films and the subjects the creators have tried to convey through this ‘difference’. The objective of this study is to analyze the changes in creators’ works on the subject of ‘artificial intelligence or artificial creatures’ and their reflections on the technology-based era and their artistic significance.this study, the following works were selected as research subjects: Representative works from 1990-2000, before the introduction of A.I. technology; representative works from 2014-2020, after the introduction of deep learning software to the market with the practicalization of deep neural network (deep learning) technology based on the Deep Belief Network developed by Geoffrey Hinton; and works published in 2023, after the popularization of Chat GPT.A.I. narratives in this study are defined as follows. First, it refers to a plot in which the protagonist, an artificial creature, has a human-like appearance and undergoes the process of programming the ideology of ‘values (thoughts)’ from humans. Second, it contains a central storyline in which the artificial creature encounters an actual reality that differs from its programming and is confused by its exclusion from the real world. Third, the narrative reaches a climax where both humans and non-human entities attempt to subvert reality by leveraging the state of confusion.following works will be analyzed for this study. This study explains the significance of dystopian worldviews in science fiction films and presents a common analytical framework for narrative construction by analyzing <Blade Runner (re-released in 1993)> and <A.I. (1999)>, which were produced before the introduction of A.I. technology.(2014)> and <Ex Machina (2015)> were selected as works that were produced shortly after the introduction of A.I.technology and before its popularization. The analysis of the two works indicates that since deep learning technology has been developed into software that can communicate with humans, the role of A.I. characters in these narratives has expanded from the position of ‘other (mirror image)’ of humanity to real personalities in the virtual world with personas. In these works, the theme represents an interpretation of how humans communicate.As a work after the popularization of Chat GPT, <Creator (2023)> was selected. The A.I. narrative of 2023 has expanded its theme beyond the discussion of technology and communication to the recovery of humanity itself. It points out that not only artificial creatures but also any creatures with different ideologies (including human beings) can be categorized as ‘non-human’ by the dominant community, and that the exclusion of humanity by A.I. can be realized from the point when A.I. is capable of training another A.I. creature. The findings also suggest that it is associated with the implications behind the cessation of A.I.technology development in 2023.This study ultimately highlights that the definition of “human” is actively deconstructed under the plot of “murdering creatures that look alike,” and that this deconstruction of the concept paradoxically allows for its..."

In order to effectively segment polyps, it is essential to fuse feature maps of various sizes while considering the semantic gaps in between. To tackle this problem, we propose MPISNet (Multi-scale Polyp Image Segemtnation Network) which is designed to detect polyps that vary in size by filling in the semantic gaps between features produced with different receptive fields. Specifically, a novel SCBi-FPN module was used to effectively fuse features of different sizes and CBAM module to re-calibrate feature maps using both channel and spatial attentions.

CRNN 알고리즘은 이미지 분류를 위한CNN과 시계열적 요소를 인식하기 위한 RNN의 조합으로 구성되는데, CRNN의 RNN영역에서 사용하는입력값은 학습 대상의 이미지를 합성곱과 풀링 기법을 적용하여 추출된 결과물을 flatten한 값이고, 이 입력값들은 이미지 내 동일 위상에 있는 픽셀값들이 서로 다른 순서로 나타나기 때문에, RNN에서의도한 이미지 내 배열 순서를 제대로 학습하기 어렵다는 한계점을 지닌다. 따라서 본 연구는 인코더와디코더의 개념을 응용한 CNN과 RNN의 새로운 하이브리드 방법을 제안하여, 이미지 분류 성능을향상시키는 것을 목적으로 하였다. 본 연구에서는 다양한 알고리즘 비교 실험을 통해, 새로운 하이브리드방법의 효과성을 검증하였다. 본 연구는 인코더와 디코더 개념의 적용 가능성을 넓히고, 제안한 방법이기존 하이브리드 방법에 비해, 복잡도가 크게 증가하지 않아 모델 학습 시간과 인프라 구축 비용측면에서 이점을 있다는 점에서 학문적 시사점을 가진다. 또한, 정확한 이미지 분류가 필요한 다양한분야에서 제공되는 서비스의 품질을 높일 수 있는 가능성을 제시하였다는 점에서 실무적 시사점을가진다.","In the era of big data, the field of artificial intelligence is showing remarkable growth, and in particular, the image classification learning methods by deep learning are becoming an important area. Various studies have been actively conducted to further improve the performance of CNNs, which have been widely used in image classification, among which a representative method is the Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) algorithm. The CRNN algorithm consists of a combination of CNN for image classification and RNNs for recognizing time series elements. However, since the inputs used in the RNN area of CRNN are the flatten values extracted by applying the convolution and pooling technique to the image, pixel values in the same phase in the image appear in different order. And this makes it difficult to properly learn the sequence of arrangements in the image intended by the RNN. Therefore, this study aims to improve image classification performance by proposing a novel hybrid method of CNN and RNN applying the concepts of encoder and decoder. In this study, the effectiveness of the new hybrid method was verified through various experiments. This study has academic implications in that it broadens the applicability of encoder and decoder concepts, and the proposed method has advantages in terms of model learning time and infrastructure construction costs as it does not significantly increase complexity compared to conventional hybrid methods. In addition, this study has practical implications in that it presents the possibility of improving the quality of services provided in various fields that require accurate image classification."
Comparative Performance Evaluation of State-of-the-Art Hyperparameter Optimization Frameworks,2023,"['Deep learning', 'Neural networks', 'Hyperparameter optimization', 'Convolutional neural network']",,"Machine learning (ML) has proven to be highly effective in solving complex problems in various domains, thanks to its ability to identify specific data tasks, perform feature engineering, and learn quickly. However, designing and training ML models is a complicated task and requires optimization. The effectiveness of ML models is highly dependent on the selection of hyperparameters that determines their performance. Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is a systematic search process to find the optimal combinations of hyperparameters to achieve robust performance. Traditional HPO methods such as grid and random search take a lot of computing time when used in large-scale applications. Recently, various automated search strategies, such as Bayesian optimization (BO) and evolutionary algorithms, have been developed to significantly reduce the computing time. In this paper, we use state-of-the-art HPO frameworks, namely BO, Optuna, HyperOpt, and Keras Tuner, for optimizing the ML and deep learning models for the classification tasks and evaluate their comparative performance using two different sets of experiments. The first one uses different ML classifiers to solve the optimal parameter selection problem with HPO. The second one attempts to optimize the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture using HPO frameworks to improve its performance in the image classification task.We use four publicly available real-world datasets including one image dataset. The experimental results show that HyperOpt -TPE outperforms the other HPO frameworks for the ML classifiers and achieves up to 94.12% of accuracy with 30 minutes for performing the optimization. Similarly, for the CNN model, HyperOpt-TPE outperforms the other HPO frameworks by improving 34% of the classification accuracy, while taking 2 hours and 24 minutes of computing time."

Pixel-Wise Polynomial Estimation Model for Low-Light Image Enhancement,2023,"['Deep learning', 'polynomial estimation', 'low-light image enhancement', 'multi-branch']",,"Most existing low-light enhancement algorithms either use a large number of training parameters or lack generalization to real-world scenarios. This paper presents a novel lightweight and robust pixel-wise polynomial approximation-based deep network for low-light image enhancement. For mapping the low-light image to the enhanced image, pixel-wise higher-order polynomials are employed. A deep convolution network is used to estimate the coefficients of these higher-order polynomials. The proposed network uses multiple branches to estimate pixel values based on different receptive fields. With a smaller receptive field, the first branch enhanced local features, the second and third branches focused on medium-level features, and the last branch enhanced global features. The low-light image is downsampled by the factor of 2b-1 (b is the branch number) and fed as input to each branch. After combining the outputs of each branch, the final enhanced image is obtained.

Anomaly Detecting Geometric Transformation Network with Outlier Exposure Defect Inspection of Real Industrial Data,2023,"['Deep learning', 'Semi-supervised learning', 'Anomaly detection', 'Out-of-distribution detection', 'Image classification']",,"Anomaly detection is one of the innovative deep learning (DL) technologies being actively applied in various industrial fields. Among them, the supervised learning approach for anomaly detection requires a large amount of normal and abnormal data. However, in real industrial situations, obtaining abnormal data can be very expensive and difficult. Therefore, in this paper, we used just normal data in a semi-supervised learning approach. 72 geometric transformations of the input sample were added to train a DL network, and to classify the transformation type using the trained network. The proposed method was applied to detect mechanical part defects on an automobile industry production line. Because it is difficult to obtain enough abnormal data in the same region of interest (ROI), to improve classification performance, a method called outlier exposal is suggested, in which the normal data in another ROI is added as abnormal data for training. Abnormal data creates a uniform distribution in the output of the network so that the class of the prediction does not belong to any kind of normal data class. Abnormal data acts the anomaly detector to be generalized more and to increase the anomaly score for new abnormal data. Experimental results verified the proposed method improved performance compared to the conventional approach."

Unlike existing modeling analysis methods, deep learning does not require various vehicle specifications and data, and the correlation between the measured data is derived by itself; therefore, it can serve as a virtual emission sensor. As it is difficult to analyze the correlation between the deep learning and test data from actual road cars because of the complex environment, an experimental single-cylinder diesel engine is used in this study. The intake air temperature is varied from 0 °C to 100 °C, and the injection timing is varied for nitrogen oxide measurement. Consequently, nitrogen oxide is successfully predicted with a high correlation R2 of 0.994 using minimal engine data."

Variance Optimization Based on Guided Anchor Siamese Network for Target-of-interest Object Recognition in Autonomous Mobile Robots,2023,"['Convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'few-shot learning', 'mobile robot', 'object recognition', 'Siamese network.']",,"Deep learning models are used to track target-of-interest (ToI) objects with autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). A Siamese network based on few-shot learning is used when there is limited training data for the ToI objects. A Siamese network recognizes the object’s class based on the similarity between the input object and the template of the ToI object. The more similar the shape of the objects to be recognized, the smaller is the interclass variance of the features extracted from the object and the larger is the intra-class variance. If the inter-class variance is small and the intra-class variance is large, it is a different from the template object; however, since the calculated similarity can be high, it can be recognized as the same class object. Alternatively, it is an object of the same class as the template object, but can be recognized as a different class of object. To increase the inter-class variance and decrease the intra-class variance, a Siamese network training method is required. This paper proposes a method that recognizes ToI objects by increasing the difference in features between the ToI object and non-ToI objects when recognizing an object using a Siamese network. When distinguishing the ToI object from non-ToI objects, images that act as an anchor for each class are selected. The images inputted to the Siamese network are trained such that the corresponding class is close to the anchor of the selected class and far from other classes. The trained Siamese network then compares the anchor and similarity of each class to determine whether it is the ToI object. An experiment was conducted to analyze the training and execution results of the Siamese network using the proposed method. The recognition results using the proposed method and an existing template-based Siamese network were compared. The convolutional neural network model trained with the proposed method yielded an average accuracy of 93.95%. The proposed method could improve the performance by 23.68% compared to the existing template-based Siamese network."

However, the bathroom remains an area of blind spot. In this study, we have developed and evaluated a new edge computer device that can automatically detect water usage activities in the bathroom and record the activity log on a cloud server. Three kinds of sound as flushing, show- ering, and washing using wash basin generated during water usage were recorded and cut into 1-second scenes.These sound clips were then converted into a 2-dimensional image using MEL-spectrogram. Sound data augmen- tation techniques were adopted to obtain better learning effect from smaller number of data sets. These techniques, some of which are applied in time domain and others in frequency domain, increased the number of training data set by 30 times. A deep learning model, called CRNN, combining Convolutional Neural Network and Recurrent Neu- ral Network was employed. The edge device was implemented using Raspberry Pi 4 and was equipped with a con- denser microphone and amplifier to run the pre-trained model in real-time. The detected activities were recorded as text-based activity logs on a Firebase server. Performance was evaluated in two bathrooms for the three water usage activities, resulting in an accuracy of 96.1% and 88.2%, and F1 Score of 96.1% and 87.8%, respectively. Most of the classification errors were observed in the water sound from washing.

MR Template-Based Individual Brain PET Volumes-of-Interest Generation Neither Using MR nor Using Spatial Normalization,2023,['Mouse brain · Deep convolutional-neural-network (CNN) · Inverse-spatial-normalization (iSN) · Templatebased volume of interest (VOI)'],,"For more anatomically precise quantitation of mouse brain PET, spatial normalization (SN) of PET onto MR template andsubsequent template volumes-of-interest (VOIs)-based analysis are commonly used. Although this leads to dependency onthe corresponding MR and the process of SN, routine preclinical/clinical PET images cannot always afford correspondingMR and relevant VOIs. To resolve this issue, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based individual-brain-specific VOIs (i.e.,cortex, hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, and cerebellum) directly generated from PET images using the inverse-spatialnormalization(iSN)-based VOI labels and deep convolutional neural network model (deep CNN). Our technique was appliedto mutated amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Eighteen mice underwentT2-weighted MRI and 18F FDG PET scans before and after the administration of human immunoglobin or antibody-basedtreatments. To train the CNN, PET images were used as inputs and MR iSN-based target VOIs as labels. Our devised methodsachieved decent performance in terms of not only VOI agreements (i.e., Dice similarity coefficient) but also the correlationof mean counts and SUVR, and CNN-based VOIs was highly accordant with ground-truth (the corresponding MR and MRtemplate-based VOIs). Moreover, the performance metrics were comparable to that of VOI generated by MR-based deepCNN. In conclusion, we established a novel quantitative analysis method both MR-less and SN-less fashion to generateindividual brain space VOIs using MR template-based VOIs for PET image quantification."

The article-broadcast style has the characteristic of being sensitive to content corruption, and can be converted into a broadcast style by processing the parentheses and final suffixes of the article style. Since the style token-based text style transfer model modifies only a portion of the sentence, it is suitable for article-broadcast transfer as it can minimize content corruption. However, there is a disadvantage that learning style tokens are difficult in studies using non-parallel data. In parallel data, different parts of two sentences with the same content can be distinguished by clear style tokens, but it requires much cost to build. Although it is possible to reduce the data required for learning by prompting, there is a problem that the content of the style token cannot be maintained.

AI plays an increasingly important role in OMF cosmetic surgery in various settings, and its usage may raise ethical issues. In addition to machine learning algorithms (a subtype of AI), convolutional neural networks (a subtype of deep learning) are widely used in OMF cosmetic surgeries. Depending on their complexity, these networks can extract and process the elementary characteristics of an image. They are, therefore, commonly used in the diagnostic process for medical images and facial photos. AI algorithms have been used to assist surgeons with diagnosis, therapeutic decisions, preoperative planning, and outcome prediction and evaluation. AI algorithms complement human skills while minimizing shortcomings through their capabilities to learn, classify, predict, and detect. This algorithm should, however, be rigorously evaluated clinically, and a systematic ethical reflection should be conducted regarding data protection, diversity, and transparency. It is possible to revolutionize the practice of functional and aesthetic surgeries with 3D simulation models and AI models. Planning, decision-making, and evaluation during and after surgery can be improved with simulation systems. A surgical AI model can also perform timeconsuming or challenging tasks for surgeons."

Serum proinflammatory cytokines and apoptotic markers, namely cytokeratin-18, are well-studied with reasonable accuracy, whereas serum metabolomics and lipidomics have been adopted in some commercially available diagnostic models. Ultrasound and computed tomography imaging techniques are attractive due to their wide availability; yet their accuracies may not be comparable with magnetic resonance imaging-based tools.

However, as the number of pressure sensors increases, the cost of data collection increases.

Initially, word filtering techniques were used to prevent malicious writing from being posted in a form that could not post or comment if a specific word was included, but they avoided filtering in a bypassed form, such as using similar words. As a way to solve this problem, deep learning was used to monitor posts posted by users in real-time, but recently, the community uses words that can only be understood by the community or from a human perspective, not from a general Korean word. There are various types and forms of characters, making it difficult to learn everything in the artificial intelligence model. Therefore, in this paper, we proposes a preprocessing technique in which each character of a sentence is imaged using a CNN model that learns the consonants, vowel and spacing images of Korean word and converts characters that can only be understood from a human perspective into characters predicted by the CNN model.

In this study, we compared and evaluated You Only Look Once Version 7 (YOLOv7), the most widely used deep learning model for real-time object detection, and detection tansformer (DETR), a transformer-based model, using underwater images for benthic marine invertebrates in the coasts of South Korea. YOLOv7 showed a mean average precision at 0.5 (mAP@0.5) of 0.899, and DETR showed an mAP@0.5 of 0.862, which implies that YOLOv7 is more appropriate for object detection of various sizes. This is because YOLOv7 generates the bounding boxes at multiple scales that can help detect small objects. Both models had a processing speed of more than 30 frames per second (FPS), so it is expected that real-time object detection from the images provided by divers and underwater drones will be possible. The proposed method can be used to prevent and restore damage to coastal fisheries ecosystems, such as rescuing invertebrate grazers and creating sea forests to prevent ocean desertification."

It is essential to collaborate across multiple institutions without sharing patient data. Most existing methods adopt distributed learning and centralized federal architecture to solve this problem, but there are problems of resource heterogeneity and data heterogeneity in the practical application process. This paper proposes a collaborative deep learning modelling method based on the blockchain network. The training process uses encryption parameters to replace the original remote source data transmission to protect privacy. Hyperledger Fabric blockchain is adopted to realize that the parties are not restricted by the third-party authoritative verification end.

HIGH DEFINITION MAP AIDED OBJECT DETECTION FOR AUTONOMOUS DRIVING IN URBAN AREAS,2023,"['Autonomous driving', 'Object detection', 'Deep learning', 'High definition map', 'Self-localizat']",,"Detecting object locations and semantic classes in an image, such as traffic signs, traffic lights, and guide signs, is the crucial problem for autonomous driving, known as object detection. However, stable object detection in complex real-world environments, such as urban environments, is still challenging because of clutter, time of day, blur etc., even with modern deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). On the other hand, a high definition (HD) map is a pre-built information resource for autonomous driving tasks, especially for controls. Besides controls, HD map utilization for detection tasks has been gaining attention in recent years, enabling us to stabilize detection even in complex real-world environments. However, it is challenging to use object information from an HD map as detection directly because the self-localization error affects the transformed object locations on the image coordinate system from the HD map’s coordinate system. This paper explores incorporating HD map information into deep feature maps of a DCNN-based model. Two proposed modules implicitly make the feature extraction efficient and stable by utilizing HD map information. As a result of the experiments, the proposed module improved a modern model for challenging images of the urban area Shinjuku by 37 % in mAP, even in self-localization errors."

The fabrication process is complexly compound of several sub-processes, and thus even if an experienced engineer manages the process with precise equipment in a clean environment, it is difficult to make a wafer with no error-free dies. Therefore, the engineer should quickly discover which sub-process is mal-functioning for high yield. Fortunately, error dies make a specific defect pattern, which corresponds to specific abnormal operation of some fabrication sub-processes. Hence, a scheme that recognizes defect patterns in a wafer map can allow fabrication engineers to make the high-quality wafer with few error dies. In this paper, we implement a capsule network based multiple-defect recognition scheme with high precision and recall per each defect pattern. This work is the first to exploit a vector-representation based network for the recognition of defects in a wafer map, and verifies that the network using vector representation shows higher performance compared to the convontional feature-map based networks."

LSTM Autoencoder를 활용한 스마트 온실 데이터 이상 탐지 구현,2023,"['Smart farm', 'Sequence data', 'Deep learning', 'LSTM autoencoder', 'Anomaly detection']",,"In this paper, LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory), a sequence data processing model, is used as an Autoencoder method that reconstructs input smart farm sensor data composed of encoders and decoders to implement an artificial intelligence model that detects anomaly in smart farm. The LSTM Autoencoder was trained by using the normal data collected from the 60 sensors installed for precise control of the greenhouse environment of the smart farm as input sequence values. The trained model obtained a very low train and validation error in the learning process, and the LSTM Autoencoder model that has finally completed the learning process contains information about normal data distribution in the representation vector, so sequence input is restored based on that information. In this restoration precess, when a sequence input that is out of the normal data distribution is received, it is applied to anomaly detection by taking advantage of the fact that the reconstruction error increases because accurate restoration does not proceed. The error that becomes the threshold value that distinguishes normal and abnormal data can be set using the loss distribution obtained in the learning process, and the error for sequence input can be visualized as an image and used for anomaly detection."

Cross‑domain health status assessment of three‑phase inverters using improved DANN,2023,"['Health status assessment', 'Transfer learning', 'Deep residual network', 'Domain adversarial neural network']",,"Information and large number of fault labels are required to achieve intelligent health status assessment of three-phase inverters. However, the current signals of inverters cannot be sufficiently collected since open-circuit faults (OCFs) occur briefly, which makes it difficult to determine the OCF mode of the various power switches. A transfer learning model that effectively uses a small amount of sample data to achieve domain adaptation is proposed to address this problem. First, collected fault-sensitive signals are subjected to a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to obtain two-dimensional image data with more abundant fault feature information. Second, the source domain and target domain features are projected into the same feature space through a domain adversarial neural network (DANN) to achieve multi-domain feature extraction and adaptation. Then, in the feature extraction module of the DANN, the deep residual network (Resnet) structure is used to replace the typical convolutional neural network (CNN) structure. Finally, an intelligent diagnosis network is used to identify the health status of the inverter samples under variable conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed model can accurately and effectively realize the cross-domain health assessment of three-phase inverters in the case of small samples. The accuracy of the proposed model is better than that of other classical transfer learning models."
BRepGAT: Graph neural network to segment machining feature faces in a B-rep model,2023,"['graph neural networks', 'deep learning', 'boundary representation', 'machining feature', 'face segmentation']",,"In recent years, there have been many studies using artificial intelligence to recognize machining features in three-dimensional models in the computer-aided design (CAD)/computer-aided manufacturing field. Most of these studies converted the original CAD data into images, point clouds, or voxels for recognition. This led to information loss during the conversion process, resulting in decreased recognition accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning model called the boundary representation graph attention network (BRepGAT) to segment faces in an original boundary representation (B-rep) model containing machining features. We define descriptors that represent information about the faces and edges of the B-rep model from the perspective of feature recognition. These descriptors are extracted from the B-rep model and transformed into homogeneous graph data, which are then passed to graph networks. BRepGAT recognizes machining features from the graph data input. Our experimental results using the MFCAD18++ dataset showed that BRepGAT achieved state-of-the-art recognition accuracy (99.1%). Furthermore, BRepGAT showed relatively robust performance on other datasets besides MFCAD18++."

Enhancing three-dimensional convolutional neural network-based geometric feature recognition for adaptive additive manufacturing: a signed distance field data approach,2023,"['additive manufacturing', 'feature recognition', 'deep learning', 'signed-distance field', 'voxel data', 'adaptive slicing']",,"In the context of additive manufacturing, the adjustment of process data to individual geometric features offers the potential to further increase manufacturing speed and quality, while being widely underestimated in recent research. Unfortunately, the current non-uniform data handling in the CAD-CAM-Link results in a downstream data loss, that prevents the availability of geometric knowledge from being present at any time to apply the more advanced approaches of adaptive slicing and tool path generation. Automatic detection of various geometric entities would be beneficial for classifying partial surfaces and volumetric ranges to gain customized informational insights of geometric parameterization. In this work, an enhanced approach of geometric deep learning for the analysis of voxelized engineering parts will be presented to align the inference representations to modeling paradigms for complex design models like architected materials. Although the baseline voxel representation offers distinct advantages in detection accuracy, it comes with an adversely large memory footprint. The geometry discretization leads to high resolutions needed to capture various detail levels that prevent the analysis of fine-grained objects. To achieve efficient usage of three-dimensional (3D) deep learning techniques, we propose a 3D-convolutional neural network-based feature recognition approach using signed distance field data to limit the needed resolution. These implicit geometric data leverage the advantages of volumetric convolution while alleviating their disadvantages through the use of the continuous signed distance function. When analyzing computer-aided design data for geometric primitive features, a common application task in surface reconstruction of reverse engineering the proposed methodology, achieves a detection accuracy that is in line with the accuracy values achieved by comparable algorithms. This enables the recognition of fine-grained surface instances. The unambiguous shape information extracted could be used in subsequent adaptive slicing algorithms to achieve individual geometry-based hatch generation."

As a solution for this, this paper proposes a method of automatically detecting the volume area of entry and exit personnel in real time using a thermal imaging camera installed at the entrance. The first step of such a detection system is to predict the exact number of people in an image, and the YoloV5 deep learning module was applied in this paper. The next step is the moving direction analysis algorithm of the thermal imaging object proposed in this paper. This algorithm analyzes the sequence of sequentially input thermal volume images and counts movement by distinguishing between incoming and outgoing people. The proposed algorithm divides the main area where the occupant moves in the image into 4 subareas and tracks the shape of the object volume and distribution change in each subarea. The proposed method showed stable detection performance even with various movement variations of pedestrians occurring at the entrance. The occupant analysis in this way is performed for each entrance of the building, and the total number of occupants in the building is estimated by adding the number of people entering and leaving the building as a whole.

By virtue of the combination of signal processing and deep learning schemes, the multi-scale feature information for IGBT’s open-circuit fault diagnosis are extracted by regarding the input current of rectifier as the original signal. More clearly, CEEMD is adopted to decompose the original signal to a series of intrinsic mode function components (IMFs).

MQTT 기반 IoT 환경에서 LSTM 및 슬라이딩 윈도우를 이용한 악성 트래픽 탐지 방법,2023,"['internet of things', 'IoT', 'IoT attack', 'MQTT', 'deep learning', 'LSTM', 'sliding window']",,"Recently, with the rapid growth of the Internet of Things(IoT) field and increasing market demand, the use of IoT devices is increasing in daily life and overall industrial areas. However, many IoT devices have been introduced to the market without sufficient consideration of security. With the emergence of attack techniques and various malicious codes, the security aspect is becoming increasingly important. In the IoT environment, the MQTT protocol, which supports efficient communication with small resources, is widely used, and security threats to the MQTT-based IoT environment are expected to increase. In this study, we proposed a sliding window based LSTM deep learning model to detect and classify malicious traffic for the MQTT protocol in the IoT environment. Using the proposed model based on the previously published MQTT traffic dataset and the dataset collected in this study, it was shown that the accuracy was improved compared to previous studies. In addition, we showed that the malicious MQTT traffic is detected in the real time environment."

However, due to a lack of research on the quality of learning data on lesion detetcting using gas- troscopy, we aimed to quantify the impact of quality difference in endoscopic images to lesion detection models using Image Quality Assessment (IQA) algorithms. Through IQA methods such as BRISQUE (Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluation), Laplacian Score, and PSNR (Peak Signal-To-Noise) algorithm on 430 sheets of high qual- ity data (HQD) and 430 sheets of low quality data (PQD), we showed that there were significant differences between high and low quality images in lesion detecting through BRISQUE and Laplacian scores (p<0.05). The PSNR value showed 10.62±1.76 dB on average, illustrating the lower lesion detection performance of PQD than HQD. In addi- tion, F1-Score of HQD showed higher detection performance at 77.42±3.36% while F1-Score of PQD showed 66.82±9.07%. Through this study, we hope to contribute to future gastroscopy lesion detection assistance systems that involve IQA algorithms by emphasizing the importance of using high quality data over lower quality data."

Entrance surface doses (ESD) measured were collected by changing exposure conditions. In the identical exposures, abdominal images were acquired and were processed with the BSRGAN. The images reconstructed by the BSRGAN were compared to a reference image with 80 kVp and 320 mA, which was evaluated by mean squared error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity index measure (SSIM). In addition, signal profile analysis was employed to validate the effect of the images reconstructed by the BSRGAN. The exposure conditions with the lowest MSE (about 0.285) were shown in 90 kVp, 125 mA and 100 kVp, 100 mA, which decreased the ESD in about 52 to 53% reduction), exhibiting PSNR = 37.694 and SSIM = 0.999. The signal intensity variations in the optimized conditions rather decreased than that of the reference image. This means that the optimized exposure conditions would obtain reasonable image quality with a substantial decrease of the radiation dose, indicating it could sufficiently reflect the concept of As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) as the principle of radiation protection."

Therefore, the knock occurrence needs to be properly controlled. For doing that, knock should preemptively be predicted and controlled. Prerequisite data for knock prediction modelling is a knock onset position, which can be figured out by finding the starting point of the oscillation on pressure data. A deep learning knock onset determination model was developed in a previous study, and showed the highest accuracy among the comparable methods, the model showed weak robustness on knock cycles obtained in different engine experiments. Meanwhile, the 1D CNN model has been widely used in signal processing fields with its advantage of having a feature extraction layer, and the model is introduced in this study for determining the knock onset.

However, SAR images are difficult to interpret because there are no color information and not easy to distinguish objects. In order to solve this problem, studies for colorizing SAR images using deep learning techniques have recently been conducted. CycleGAN, which has been used in conventional unsupervised learning, is not suitable for SAR images with geometric distortion due to its limited geometric transformation because of its cyclic structure. In addition, the PatchGAN discriminator, widely used in image translation models, is unsuitable for satellite images with complex shape changes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a model that applies a SPatchGAN discriminator that discriminates images through statistical features of images based on the CUT that has advantages in geometric transformation.

However, most existing analyzers present morpheme analysis results by learning word unit tokens as input values. However, since Korean words are consist of postpositions and affixes that are attached to the root, even if they have the same root, the meaning tends to change due to the postpositions or affixes. Therefore, learning morphemes using word unit tokens can lead to misclassification of postposition or affixes. In this paper, we use morpheme-level tokens to grasp the inherent meaning in Korean sentences and propose a morpheme analyzer based on a sequence generation method using Transformer. In addition, a user dictionary is constructed based on corpus data to solve the out-of-vocabulary problem.

The diagnosis of IC/BPS is primarily based on symptoms such as urgency, frequency, and bladder or pelvic pain. While the exact causes of IC/BPS remain unclear, it is thought to involve several factors, including abnormalities in the bladder’s urothelium, mast cell degranulation within the bladder, inflammation of the bladder, and altered innervation of the bladder. Treatment options include patient education, dietary and lifestyle modifications, medications, intravesical therapy, and surgical interventions. This review article provides insights into IC/BPS, including aspects of treatment, prognosis prediction, and emerging therapeutic options. Additionally, it explores the application of deep learning for diagnosing major diseases associated with IC/BPS."
In Search of a Backward Unit Design through Narrative-based Neuroscience,2023,"['backward design', 'Understanding by Design', 'deep learning', 'narrative-based neuroscience', 'neuroscience of narrative']",,"The purpose of this study was to develop a backward design method that emphasizes the progress of learners’ deep understanding. As an alternative to the traditional unit design method, which has been criticized for its delivery of content and purposeless learning activities, the backward design method has been implemented in classrooms. However, the current mechanical application of the backward design method has not achieved its original purpose, and there is an emerging need to integrate the findings of modern cognitive science, including brain science. Consequently, it is necessary to develop a more advanced and integrated method for encouraging the deep understanding skills of learners, as emphasized by the backward design method. This study aimed to reflect on the recent developments in backward unit design in learning science. The most significant aspect of this development is neuroscience, and this study integrated it with narrative-based neuroscience to enhance the emphasis on learner relevance in understanding through design. Therefore, the study attempted to develop a backward unit design based on narrative neuroscience. A literature review and case study were conducted to develop an integrated design that is more advanced than the existing one. The unit design proposed in this study is a conceptual model, and it is essential for the adoption of teaching and learning strategies in the context of future classroom practices to fully understand narrative neuroscience."
One-Class Convolutional Neural Network (OC-CNN) Model for Rapid Bridge Damage Detection Using Bridge Response Data,2023,"['Rapid bridge damage detection', 'Semi-supervised learning', 'Convolutional neural network', 'Bridge response data', 'Damage-sensitive features', 'Vehicle-bridge coupling system']",,"This study proposes a numerical investigation for rapid bridge damage detection based on a semi-supervised deep learning (DL) model and a damage index (DI)-based Gaussian process. The proposed damage detection method uses bridge response data (acceleration and displacement data) from various damage scenarios within a simply supported girder bridge subjected to a two-axle moving vehicle load. As for semi-supervised learning, we used a one-class convolutional neural network (OC-CNN) model. This model combines a one-class (OC) classification algorithm with a simple one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) configuration. The performance of the proposed OC-CNN model was evaluated through a numerical example of a vehicle-bridge coupling system. The proposed OC-CNN model trained using acceleration data showed promising results for different vehicle weights and speeds. These results offer confidence in using the prediction error loss of the proposed OC-CNN model as an ideal damage-sensitive feature for rapid bridge damage detection. In addition, the Gaussian process used in the DI can classify the prediction error losses resulting from the change induced by different damage severities (10%, 20%, and 30%) and different types of damage scenarios (single damage, double damages, and multiple damages). These results emphasize the potential of the proposed damage detection method to monitor the state of bridges in practical engineering."
SAM Optimizer를 통한 위내시경 이미지 분류 CADx의 성능 향상 연구,2023,"['CADx', 'Gastric Diagnosis', 'Classification', 'Convolution Neural Network', 'Deep learning', 'Vision Transformer']",,"Gastric cancer has a high incidence in East Asians, and the risk increases over time. Often, gastric cancer presents no early symptoms, leading to missed treatments. Consequently, in Korea, support is provided to individuals over 40 years of age who undergo gastroscopy. However, as the number of gastroscopy patients increases, doctors' fatigue rises, becoming a factor that can lead to misdiagnosis. Therefore, this paper proposes a CADx (Computer-Aided Diagnosis) system for gastric lesion classification based on ConvNeXt and ViT (Vision Transformer), applying the SAM (Sharpness Aware Minimization) optimizer. ConvNeXt is a network that achieves high performance by incorporating techniques from Swin Transformer and the latest advancements, with ResNet-50 as the base model. ViT divides the image into smaller patches and uses these patches as input to the Transformer. This allows for learning relationships between patches and ultimately leads to image classification. To address the issue of limited data in medical images, the gastric abnormal dataset was augmented using the AutoAugment policy. The SAM Optimizer is an optimization technique that detects and minimizes the ""sharpness"" of the loss function that may occur during the deep learning model's learning process. Using this method, the sensitivity of classifying abnormal and normal gastroscopy images in ConvNeXt increased from 0.7167 to 0.9583 for the original dataset and from 0.7583 to 0.9833 for the augmented dataset. ViT exhibited a significant decrease from 0.9500 to 0.7750 in the original dataset but increased from 0.9500 to 0.9583 in the augmented dataset. This demonstrates that the SAM Optimizer can effectively enhance CADx performance."

Particularly, due to Chat-GPT being an interactive generative AI, the immediate connection between AI and literature emerged as it acquires information and communicates through the same ‘language’ as humans. This controversy intensified when a collection of poems authored by ChatGPT was published and collaborations between poets and ChatGPT were introduced. Regarding this phenomenon, there are conflicting viewpoints. Some argue that AI cannot create art based on ‘emotion(sentiment)’ since it cannot experience emotions identical to humans. On the other side, it is already established that AI can create artistic works, although there may be differences in aesthetic quality. These discussions are particularly concentrated in the field of poetry.This text revolves around the central figures of the recent discourse on the relationship between artificial intelligence and literature, Kwon Bo-Yeon and Kim Eon, highlighting the issues AI raises in poetry creation and the responses from poets and critics. Kwon Bo-Yeon contends that what AI does is ‘generation’ not ‘creation’, suggesting that the term ‘construct’ is more suitable than ‘write’. From this perspective, he emphasizes the distinction between ‘the language of process’ and ‘the language of outcome’. Meanwhile, Kim Eon emphasizes the presence of the ‘author’ and distinguishes between ‘speech that advocates presence’ and ‘speech that advocates absence’. In this context, the ‘author’ is not just a physical entity like a ‘writer’, but a subjective agent of individuality. He argues that in poetry, this device grants legitimacy to the qualifier ‘mine’. Since AI lacks this aspect in its language, it is challenging to consider it as ‘poetry’. Throughout this text, various arguments from different scholars are introduced, pointing out the problems they carry, in an effort to address the question, ‘Can artificial intelligence(AI) write poetry?’"

In general, electromyography signals are observed to prevent muscle injury, and repeated stretch exercises can cause muscle injury. Exercise that causes muscle injury appears as a tendency for the low-frequency region of the EMG signal to increase. Based on this, many studies observe that the median frequency of the EMG signal to confirm the degree of muscle fatigue. In addition, it is said that artificial intelligence technology can find patterns in irregular information and learn them to improve signal prediction results. Therefore, this study aims to predict EMG signals using LSTM, one of the marker-less motion analysis data-based deep learning models in an isotonic exercise environment. 5 participants (age: 26±1.73 years, height: 171.4±4.10 cm, weight: 67.2±3.56 kg) participated in the experiment, and the One arm Dumbbell curl was performed to observe the EMG signal change of the upper arm's brachii muscle. The exercise speed per time was set to 30bpm, and if the condition was not satisfied, the experiment was terminated. During the experiment, EMG signals and information on the joints of arms and shoulders were collected. As a result of the experiment, the central frequency level of the EMG signal in the set decreased by 13.884±1.856% on average, and marker-less motion analysis data showed that the period of each part decreased by 32.39±4.447% as the number of sets increased. Based on the collected information, the AUC result of the LSTM model was 85.41%, confirming high accuracy. Through this, it was possible to confirm the predictability of the EMG signal based on the marker-less motion analysis data."

The collected data was classified into four classes: ground, trees, sky and obstacles for pre-processing for training. Sliding window techniques were used on the image dataset for model training and performance. The image was sampled using a sliding window method with 224x224 pixels and divided into train, validation, and test sets. A modified VGG16 algorithm was implemented and used to train the preprocessed image dataset. The performance results of this model showed an accuracy of up to approximately 99% on both the training and validation sets, and after building a confusion matrix using the test set, the classification performance was evaluated and showed an F1 score of 0.96. To visualise the results of this trained learning model, class activation maps were used to detect the paths in the orchard.

What is the Impact of COVID-19 on Residential Water Use?,2023,"['Residential water use', 'Climate change', 'Deep learning', 'New confirmed COVID-19 cases']",,"The characteristics of residential water use (RWU) can be impacted by climate change and anthropogenic factors. This study explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the temperature rise in RWU. First, the change in RWU was estimated based on temperature using a deep learning technique and compared with the observed RWU. As a result, there was an increase in estimated RWU due to the increase in temperature, similar to previous studies. However, the estimated RWU was smaller than the observed RWU. Second, we explored the causes of RWU that did not increase as expected. The reason for the lower-than-expected observations could be found in the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases. As the number of new confirmed cases increased, the observed RWU decreased in a linear relationship. Due to the restrictions on gatherings of more than 5 people and restrictions on public facilities and bathhouses due to social distancing measures, commercial, public and bathhouse water use has decreased compared to before COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic affected RWU, which was less than the annual average in 2021. The increase in water consumption due to climate change was temporarily controlled by the COVID-19 pandemic. A sustainable long-term plan is needed to maintain this environmental benefit because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which can also contribute to preventing future epidemics."

In particular, improvement of the performance of the quality management model is difficult due to a lack of data and unbalanced data distribution. In this paper, we propose a new approach that enhances press process data by utilizing adversarial generation networks and improves the accuracy and generalization ability of quality management models. Data generation and defect determination are performed by applying a reinforcement learning model to the creator of the adversarial generation network and a deep neural network model to the discriminator. Reinforcement learning was introduced in generative adversarial networks (GANs) model to improve the performance of the generator. Reinforcement learning also improved its applicability in real manufacturing environments by showing robust performance against unbalanced class distributions or various defective patterns. It could contribute to substantial quality and cost reduction improvement through the development of AI models and the application and verification of manufacturing processes."

Most language models are used to learn generalized linguistic information from pre-training data and then update their weights for downstream tasks through a fine-tuning process. However, some concerns have been raised that privacy may be violated in the process of using these language models, i.e., data privacy may be violated when data owner provides large amounts of data to the model owner to perform fine-tuning of the language model. Conversely, when the model owner discloses the entire model to the data owner, the structure and weights of the model are disclosed, which may violate the privacy of the model. The concept of offsite tuning has been recently proposed to perform fine-tuning of language models while protecting privacy in such situations. But the study has a limitation that it does not provide a concrete way to apply the proposed methodology to text classification models. In this study, we propose a concrete method to apply offsite tuning with an additional classifier to protect the privacy of the model and data when performing multi-classification fine-tuning on Korean documents. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology, we conducted experiments on about 200,000 Korean documents from five major fields, ICT, electrical, electronic, mechanical, and medical, provided by AIHub, and found that the proposed plug-in model outperforms the zero-shot model and the offsite model in terms of classification accuracy."

In particular, the exclusion of articles generating neutral sentiment (neither positive nor negative) further enhances the profitability of the portfolio. In addition, the study shows that constructing portfolios based on the polarity of sentiment, rather than considering its positive or negative intensity , improves profitability. The significance of this study lies in its introduction of a novel framework for constructing asset allocation strategies. By utilizing objective information from publicly available news articles, it effectively circumvents the limitations tied to subjective investor judgment in predicting expected returns.

People from every aspect of life as well as the entire health system have been severely impacted by this pandemic. Even now, after almost three years of the pandemic declaration, the fear caused by the COVID-19 virus leading to higher depression, stress, and anxiety levels has not been fully overcome. This has also triggered numerous kinds of discussions covering various aspects of the pandemic on the social media platforms. Among these aspects is the part focused on vaccines developed by different countries, their features and the advantages and disadvantages associated with each vaccine.

Automated facilities and convenient systems have increased yields. However, there are many difficulties in preventing plant diseases so far. Apple blossoms suffer from fruit burn. Fruit burn disease takes the form of burnt stems, leaves, flowers, etc., and apple blossoms cannot bear fruit when caught in this disease. In order to prevent fruit burn disease, it is necessary to be able to identify the flowering period among the growth stages of apple blossoms. Water burn can be prevented by spraying pesticides during the flowering period after identification. This paper focuses on preventing fruit burn disease by identifying the flowering period by classifying the growth stages of apple blossoms. The class imbalance problem was improved by directly taking images of apple blossom growth stages and using augmentation for insufficient classes. Train several deep learning models and compare and analyze their performance. As a result of comparison, YOLOX showed the highest performance."

First, cultural arts education using the Deep Dream Generator to create visual content can enhance creativity through the ability to critically appreciate distorted images. Second, cultural arts education on image creation using adversarial neural networks is a process of creating content following image creation in storytelling, helping to understand the context between language, image and image expression. Third, the game-type learning process using machine learning and block coding for object recognition can yield various experimental project results, and new communication skills required for future society can be learned through convergence of education between artificial intelligence and culture and art.This new cultural art convergence education process in various gamification formats can achieve higher learning effects than traditional education methods and improves AI literacy as well as the understanding of science and technology necessary for the future society.

It is considered one of the leading causes of infection-related deaths in children and seniors worldwide. Clinicians usually use chest X-ray images to diagnose pneumonia. However, pneumonia is prone to be misdiagnosed because it overlaps with cold and flu, causing severe and critical medical complications. Consequently, alternative supportive diagnostic methods are needed to minimize human errors and assist clinicians. Several attempts have used artificial intelligence systems, mainly in deep learning methods, to assist clinicians in early pneumonia diagnoses. However, further studies are required to consolidate the use of deep learning as an assistant tool to diagnose pneumonia accurately. In this study, we examine the Swin Transformer and the Residual Neural Network’s performance in classifying pneumonia and healthy chest X-ray images using the Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center dataset and the COVID19, Pneumonia and Normal Chest X-ray Posteroanterior dataset. The experiment results demonstrate that the Swin Transformer achieves an accuracy of 98.9% in the Chest X-ray images dataset and 92.35% in the COVID19, Pneumonia and Normal Chest X-ray Posteroanterior dataset, while the Residual Neural Network achieves an accuracy of 97.9% and 88.8% respectively in classifying pneumonia.

The performance of the method was investigated through a structural test of a steel frame. An image-to-image regression (I2IR) training method was developed based on the U-Net layer for image recognition. In the I2IR method, the U-Net is modified to generate images of entire displacement shapes when images of partial displacement shapes of structures are input to the AI network. Furthermore, the training of displacements combined with the location feature was developed so that nodal displacement values with corresponding nodal coordinates could be used in AI training. The proposed training methods can consider correlations between nodal displacements in 3D space, and the accuracy of displacement predictions is improved compared with artificial neural network training methods. Displacements of the steel frame were predicted during the structural tests using the proposed methods and compared with 3D scanning data of displacement shapes. The results show that the proposed AI prediction properly follows the measured displacements using 3D scanning."

Physics informed neural networks for surrogate modeling of accidental scenarios in nuclear power plants,2023,"['Nuclear power plant', 'Accidental scenario', 'Modeling and simulation', 'Deep-learning', 'Physics informed neural network', 'Surrogate model', 'Metamodel', 'Nuclear battery', 'Nuclear microreactor']",,"Licensing the next-generation of nuclear reactor designs requires extensive use of Modeling and Simulation (M&S) to investigate system response to many operational conditions, identify possible accidental scenarios and predict their evolution to undesirable consequences that are to be prevented or mitigated via the deployment of adequate safety barriers. Deep Learning (DL) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can support M&S computationally by providing surrogates of the complex multi-physics high-fidelity models used for design. However, DL and AI are, generally, low-fidelity ‘black-box’ models that do not assure any structure based on physical laws and constraints, and may, thus, lack interpretability and accuracy of the results. This poses limitations on their credibility and doubts about their adoption for the safety assessment and licensing of novel reactor designs.In this regard, Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are receiving growing attention for their ability to integrate fundamental physics laws and domain knowledge in the neural networks, thus assuring credible generalization capabilities and credible predictions. This paper presents the use of PINNs as surrogate models for accidental scenarios simulation in Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs). A case study of a Loss of Heat Sink (LOHS) accidental scenario in a Nuclear Battery (NB), a unique class of transportable, plug-and-play microreactors, is considered.

FGW-FER: Lightweight Facial Expression Recognition with Attention,2023,"['Attention', 'Depth-wise separable convolution', 'Facial expression recognition', 'Lightweight deep learning model', 'Residual block']",,"The field of facial expression recognition (FER) has been actively researched to improve human-computer interaction. In recent years, deep learning techniques have gained popularity for addressing FER, with numerous studies proposing end-to-end frameworks that stack or widen significant convolutional neural network layers. While this has led to improved performance, it has also resulted in larger model sizes and longer inference times. To overcome this challenge, our work introduces a novel lightweight model architecture. The architecture incorporates three key factors: Depth-wise Separable Convolution, Residual Block, and Attention Modules. By doing so, we aim to strike a balance between model size, inference speed, and accuracy in FER tasks. Through extensive experimentation on popular benchmark FER datasets, our proposed method has demonstrated promising results.

Cold sensitivity classification using facial image based on convolutional neural network,2023,"['cold pattern', 'cold sensitivity', 'facial diagnosis', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'AI']",,"Objectives: Facial diagnosis is an important part of clinical diagnosis in traditional East Asian Medicine. In this paper, we proposed a model to quantitatively classify cold sensitivity using a fully automated facial image analysis system.Methods: We investigated cold sensitivity in 452 subjects. Cold sensitivity was determined using a questionnaire and the Cold Pattern Score (CPS) was used for analysis. Subjects with a CPS score below the first quartile (low CPS group) belonged to the cold non-sensitivity group, and subjects with a CPS score above the third quartile (high CPS group) belonged to the cold sensitivity group. After splitting the facial images into train/validation/test sets, the train and validation set were input into a convolutional neural network to learn the model, and then the classification accuracy was calculated for the test set.Results: The classification accuracy of the low CPS group and high CPS group using facial images in all subjects was 76.17%. The classification accuracy by sex was 69.91% for female and 62.86% for male. It is presumed that the deep learning model used facial color or facial shape to classify the low CPS group and the high CPS group, but it is difficult to specifically determine which feature was more important.Conclusions: The experimental results of this study showed that the low CPS group and the high CPS group can be classified with a modest level of accuracy using only facial images. There was a need to develop more advanced models to increase classification accuracy."

In particular, since the main motive for listening to music is to obtain emotional effects such as mood change and memories, emotion classification along with genre classification of music is very important. However, as in all emotion-related applications, the accuracy of emotion recognition is crucial because when a classification or recommendation that does not fit the user's emotion is given, the result will cause greater user's antipathy and disappointment compared to other errors. In addition to traditional machine learning models, various deep neural network models have recently been applied and many research results have been reported. However, the accuracy of the models is inevitably limited to the dataset used, and benchmark datasets for generalized performance evaluation have not yet been reported. In this paper, as an initial approach towards a “ground-truth” dataset for music emotion and genre classification, we constructed a dataset through labeling of a large number of ordinary people rather than a small number of labellers and extracted features according to MPEG-7 audio standard. Different machine learning models based on statistics and artificial neural network are applied to automatically classify the datasets and we evaluated the suitability of the datasets through the classification results."

In particular, studies using satellite images for population estimation of subregions are being introduced. In the early days, night-time satellite images were mainly used, but after the deep learning CNN algorithm was introduced, studies using day-time satellite images have been introduced. In this study, we tried to estimate the 1km gridded population using day-time satellite images and CNN transfer learning in Korea. As a result of the study, the possibility of estimation was confirmed, but satisfactory results were not obtained like previous studies.

Dynamic Framerate SlowFast Network for Improving Autonomous Driving Performance,2023,"['YOLO', 'SlowFast network', 'Action recognition', 'Autonomous driving']",,"Computer vision technology is used for autonomous driving and road traffic safety. Accordingly, studies on deep learning models that detect and analyze objects through images or videos are ongoing. On the other hand, deep learning algorithms that detect even the action of things require high computing performance. In addition, the computing performance of autonomous driving vehicles for processing such tasks is inferior. These classification processes are not used for recognizing and determining autonomous driving vehicles because it is impossible to process the classification of the action of autonomous driving vehicles in an autonomous driving vehicle on a real-time basis. This paper proposes a Dynamic Framerate SlowFast network for improving autonomous driving performance. Unlike pre-existing studies, the proposed model includes a cropping process through the YOLO model. In addition, it measures the similarity between unit frames through the SSIM and skips the input when the similarity exceeds a certain level. This process made it possible to reduce the number of frames entered into the model. Compared to the existing SlowFast Network, the performance evaluation compared the time required to analyze one image and the AUC of classification results when the number of input frames was reduced through similarity analysis techniques. The similarity analysis technique achieved the highest AUC when the SSIM was applied. The Dynamic Framerate SlowFast network proposed in this study achieved an AUC of 0.7126 and took an FPS of 0.7912 to analyze the entire verification video data. Compared to the pre-existing SlowFast network, which took an FPS of 0.5285 to achieve an AUC of 0.7531, the Dynamic Framerate SlowFast network achieved faster and more accurate results. Therefore, using the proposed technique, it is possible to achieve faster detection results while maintaining the object action detection AUC of the SlowFast network."

Deep learning in medical images raises the expectations for computer-assisted diagnosis, but there is a risk of being vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In addition, in the case of the double segmentation model, the defense of adversarial attacks is more difficult, but security studies related to this topic have not received attention. In this study, we perform FGSM attacks ony brain tumor segmentation models and employ input image transformation and gradient regularization as defenses against these attacks. The proposed application of JPEG compression and Gaussian filters effectively removes adversarial noise while maintaining performance in the original images. Moreover, the input image transformation method, when compared to the conventional gradient regularization model for achieving robustness, not only exhibits a higher defense performance but also offers the advantage of being applicable without the need for model retraining. Through this research, we identify vulnerabilities in the security of medical artificial intelligence and propose ensuring robustness that can be applied in the preprocessing stage of the model."

Through the results of word cloud and text frequency analysis, the fluctuations in public trust in the military and their correlation with the analyzed news articles could be observed. The research findings identified factors influencing the fluctuations in public trust in the military, such as exposure to negative words like damage and accidents, the pandemic situation caused by COVID-19, and the exposure of words related to improving soldiers' meals.Furthermore, by utilizing sentiment analysis using the KNU Korean Sentiment Dictionary constructed by Kunsan National University and verifying the performance of deep learning models, the optimal mean absolute error (MAE) value was derived. This suggests the potential usefulness of the correlation between news data and public trust in the military for the development of national defense policies and crisis management. However, this study has limitations in that it used the Ministry of National Defense Newsroom's defense news as research data, considering its nature as a single media source with a pro-military bias. Therefore, in the future, there is a need to further develop the research by considering more data collection, refined data analysis assumptions, and data collection from various media sources.Nevertheless, this study serves as a rare example in the research of public trust in the military, and it is significant in that it has derived empirical results through big data analysis.

Predicting emergency response volume can help law enforcement agencies efficiently allocate police resources to high-risk areas and dates, thereby preventing crime. However, it is also important to understand the factors that contribute to high call volume on specific dates and times. Police officers may have a sense of whether call volume will be high or low based on their experience and intuition. Similarly, the general public may make assumptions about which factors contribute to higher call volumes. In fact, there is a significant difference in call volume between holidays and weekdays, as several studies have confirmed that holidays have a significant impact on call volume. However, clear variables can reduce the impact of other variables on the prediction model and can become the sole criterion for all predictions. Additionally, variables with relatively low variability may not have a significant impact on call volume prediction. For these reasons, it is important to understand the impact of each variable on prediction results, select the necessary variables for predicting 112 emergency calls, and understand why the model selects certain variables to build an effective prediction model. Through this study, we can examine the key variables that influence the model and their explanatory power, and provide the essential variables needed to construct a 112 emergency call prediction model, without relying solely on model performance improvement."

The study focuses on determining the location of a loosened bolt and clamping force of the corresponding bolt, using the frequency response and MS similarity functions. The dynamic characteristics of the bolted structure vary depending on the degree and location of the loosened bolt. The results show that the MS similarity function exhibits more distinctive changes than the frequency response function around each natural frequency and is better suited to diagnose bolt looseness. For the finite element model of the bolted structure, a reduced order model generated by the Krylov subspace-based model order reduction method efficiently obtains the frequency response for each case of bolt looseness, and the corresponding MS similarity function is also calculated. Then, a method of generating an MS similarity map is suggested in the form of a heat map image that can be effectively incorporated into a deep learning algorithm. The research findings demonstrate that the MS similarity map can be used to identify the locations of loosened bolts and quantitatively assess the degree of bolt loosening, offering great practical potential in the field of structural health monitoring."

The direct measurement method of tool wear using image and optical sensors is more accurate than indirect measurement, but it is mainly used to measure the amount of wear because it is difficult to apply in real time. Existing studies have been conducted mainly on flank wear caused by friction with workpiece. On the other hand, crater wear is an important monitoring factor because it is caused by friction with chips generated during processing and causes sudden tool breakage. However, for crater wear, it is difficult to measure the amount of wear because the indicator of the amount of wear is depth. Therefore, although image processing-based studies have been conducted to measure the amount of crater wear, there is a clear limit to accurately measure the depth only with the image on the top of the tool.

However, identifying AF remains challenging because it occurs sporadically. Deep learning could be used to identify hidden AF based on the sinus rhythm (SR) electrocardiogram (ECG). We combined known AF risk factors and developed a deep learning algorithm (DLA) for predicting AF to optimize diagnostic performance in ESUS patients.Methods: A DLA was developed to identify AF using SR 12-lead ECG with the database consisting of AF patients and non-AF patients. The accuracy of the DLA was validated in 221 ESUS patients who underwent insertable cardiac monitor (ICM) insertion to identify AF.Results: A total of 44,085 ECGs from 12,666 patient were used for developing the DLA. The internal validation of the DLA revealed 0.862 (95% confidence interval, 0.850–0.873) area under the curve (AUC) in the receiver operating curve analysis. In external validation data from 221 ESUS patients, the diagnostic accuracy of DLA and AUC were 0.811 and 0.827, respectively, and DLA outperformed conventional predictive models, including CHARGE-AF, C2HEST, and HATCH. The combined model, comprising atrial ectopic burden, left atrial diameter and the DLA, showed excellent performance in AF prediction with AUC of 0.906.Conclusions: The DLA accurately identified paroxysmal AF using 12-lead SR ECG in patients with ESUS and outperformed the conventional models. The DLA model along with the traditional AF risk factors could be a useful tool to identify paroxysmal AF in ESUS patients."

CNN-based fault classification considered fault location of vibration signals,2023,['· Condition diagnosis · Convolutional neural network · RGB image · Classification · Sensor location recognition · Automated diagnosis'],,"Recently, with the development of the 4th industrial technology such as big data, cloud computing, and IoT, technologies that automatically perform specific tasks without human intervention are being applied in many industrial sites. In the case of rotating equipment diagnosis, features are extracted based on the shape and statistical information of the time and frequency signals of the vibration data for each location, and the acquired data is classified as normal or defective by learning it. However, since this method used the shape and statistical information of the vibration signals, the physical meaning is blurred and the information is not meaningful for actual diagnosis, resulting in inconsistent learning models even in the same facility.In this study, the possibility of classifying normal and fault condition were confirmed by generating images considering the fault component and sensor location of the vibration signal and applying to CNN-based deep learning technology.

An AI artwork won an award and caused controversy at an art exhibition held in the United States. However, research on image-generative AI is still limited and mainly focuses on technical aspects, such as content development. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to provide basic data on how to use image-generative AI in the future and to suggest directions for its use by examining the types of image-generative AI currently available on online platforms and analyzing ways to utilize them. (Method) This study first examined the concept of neural network deep learning and the types and utilization cases of image-generative AI through a literature review, and then found representative cases of each type of image-generative AI to analyze its utilization characteristics. Among the image-generative AIs available online as of October 31, 2022, those with clear cases of transfer, translation, and extension were selected as representative cases. To analyze the utilization of the representative cases, four types of detailed information were used as scales: input method, image style, sample suggestion, and utilization. Subsequently, detailed scales were applied to each representative case to analyze its characteristics. (Results) First, Midjourney, a representative AI image generator that uses image transfer, generates images using a text-to-image method and is used to create images in a pictorial style. Second, Artbreeder, a representative AI image generator that uses image translation, creates a new translation by uploading an existing image or adjusting a slider on an already created image and is used for a photo-realistic or semi-realistic image style. Third, Dall-E 2, a representative AI image generator that uses image extension, extends the image or modifies its contents using inpainting and outpainting techniques, and is easy to use for photo-style images. Regarding the utilization characteristics of image-generative AI, the convenience varies depending on the input method and various translations of images are possible depending on the effects provided by the tool. The difference in the number of samples makes it easier to obtain the desired image. (Conclusions) Image-generative AIs use different input methods and image styles based on transfer, translation, and extension. Therefore, users must select and use appropriate image transfer, translation, and extension AIs depending on the purpose of image utilization."

Early detection and correct treatment of early gastric cancer (EGC) can greatly increase survival rates. To determine this, it is important to accurately determine the diagnosis and depth of the lesion and the presence or absence of metastasis to the lymph nodes, and suggest an appropriate treatment method. The deep learning algorithm, which has learned gastric lesion endoscopyimages, morphological characteristics, and patient clinical information, detects gastric lesions with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, and predicts morphological characteristics. Through this, AI assists the judgment of specialists to help select the correct treatment method among endoscopic procedures and radical resections and helps to predict the resection margins of lesions.

However, there were limitations in the data used for learning, such as the amount of quantitatively insufficient data, retrospective study design, single-center design, and cases of non-various lesions. Nevertheless, this assisted endoscopic diagnosis technology that incorporates deep learning technology is sufficiently practical and future-oriented and can play an important role in suggesting accurate treatment plans to surgeons for resection of lesions in the treatment of EGC."

Monitoring these changes directly in the field is challenging because of the geographical and spatial features of Baekdu Mountain. Therefore, remote sensing technology is crucial. Synthetic aperture radar utilizes high-transmittance microwaves to directly emit and detect the backscattering from objects. This weatherproof approach allows monitoring in every climate. Additionally, it can accurately differentiate between water bodies and land based on their distinct roughness and permittivity characteristics. Therefore, satellite radar is highly suitable for monitoring the water area of Cheonji. The existing algorithms for classifying water bodies using satellite radar images are significantly impacted by speckle noise and shadows, resulting in frequent misclassification. Deep learning techniques are being utilized in algorithms to accurately compute the area and boundary of interest in an image, surpassing the capabilities of previous algorithms. This study involved the creation of an AI dataset specifically designed for detecting water bodies in Cheonji. The dataset was constructed using satellite radar images from TerraSAR-X, Sentinel-1, and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2. The primary objective was to accurately detect the area and level of water bodies.

Registration-free Minimally Invasive Surgery Without Preoperative Phase,2023,"['Registration-free', 'robot-assisted point cloud acquisition', 'stiffness estimation', 'surface reconstruction.']",,"Many types of research on robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) have been conducted, and its use in actual surgery is increasing. However, prior image information regarding the surgical target is required to generate a path for the surgical tool for RMIS. The image coordinate, target’s coordinate, and robot coordinate should be aligned through registration. However, errors are bound to occur during the image acquisition and registration. As the image acquisition time and registration time increase, the error between the patient and the coordinate information at the time of the actual operation increases due to the movement of the patient. To minimize these errors, this study proposes a registration-free approach to MIS without the preoperative phase in which a robot is used to directly contact the target to obtain a point cloud and reconstruct the shape information of the target. Using the position-based impedance and constraint controls for the remote center of motion (RCM) of the robot for MIS, the position information of the target can be acquired in the form of a point cloud without damage. Further, by converting the obtained point cloud into a mesh form using the Point2Mesh deep learning algorithm, it is possible to reconstruct the area where the position information is insufficient because there is no contact among the target areas. The process could obtain the coordinates within 3 min for the phantom. After a deep learning process of about 10 min, a surgical path using a robot could be generated. The reconstruction accuracy showed a RMSE of up to 0.35 mm. Additionally, this method enables the acquisition of stiffness information of the target, unlike using the prior image information. Therefore, it is expected that a stiffness overlay can be constructed and used for the diagnosis and treatment of targets."

Hence, continuous monitoring of the equipment’s operation is required to better understand the variations associated with the process and the machine. The conventional monitoring platform requires comprehensive data analysis using multiple sensors, and controller data to detect, diagnose, and prognose machine and process conditions. This increases the cost and complexity of installing a monitoring platform. The energy consumption data contains valuable information that could be potentially used to identify machine and process variations. The information can also be used to develop potential energy-saving strategies in an effort towards Green Manufacturing. This paper proposes an intelligent energy monitoring method using a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) to effortlessly and accurately obtain the working status information of the machine with minimal retrofitting. The 1D-CNN uses the energy consumption data to determine the equipment’s operation status by identifying the working components and the feed rate of the moving axis. The hyper-parameters of the developed model were optimized to improve the prediction accuracy. The paper also compares different Deep Learning and Machine Learning algorithms to gauge their effective performance in this application. Finally, the model with the highest accuracy was validated on a 5-axis ultra-precision CNC machine tool. Results show that 1D-CNN performs better than multi-layer neural networks and machine learning algorithms in processing time-series datasets. The classification accuracy of 1D-CNN on the detection of operation status and feed rate of each axis can reach 95.7 and 91.4%, respectively. Further studies are currently in progress to improve prediction accuracy of the model, and to detect subtle changes in energy consumption which would enable identification of the machine and process anomalies."

Despite the consensus that AI should be ethical, debates are ongoing about defining and realizing ethical AI, which encompasses elements of ethical AI, ethical requirements, technical standards, and best practices, among others.Particularly, AI plays a crucial role in the field of education.Elementary-school students, who will become designers, developers, users, and evaluators of future AI, must develop the capacity to address and solve ethical issues that emerge from AI use. Hence, AI ethics education for elementary students is necessary for cultivating the skills required to become essential participants of a future society that extensively uses AI.To this end, this study analyzes the content and structure of the revised 2022 curriculum of Republic of Korea from the perspective of AI ethics education. It then proposes a lesson plan by organizing essential AI ethics–related content that focuses on four themes, namely, autonomous driving cars, cyborgs, the brain, and education. Finally, it assesses the effectiveness of the developed lesson plan through implementation in real-world classrooms.The study draws the following conclusions and implications after the proactive implementation of the AI ethics education program in classrooms. First, introducing AI ethics programs enhanced moral reasoning and AI literacy in the cognitive, definitional, and behavioral aspects. Second, the interest of students in AI ethics education increased after the implementation of the theme-centered AI Ethics program. Third, allowing individual learning within the program helped elucidate the position of students on AI ethics issues. Finally, the study extracted and organized the core content of AI ethics in the revised 2022 curriculum and suggested the need for the dissemination of AI ethics in the field with the addition of new features and capabilities."

However, it is difficult to solve the change 1) in the sensor domain caused by heterogeneous LiDAR sensors and 2) in the environmental domain caused by different environmental factors. We overcome domain differences in the semi-supervised setting with 3-stage model parameter training. First, we pre-train the model with the source dataset with object scaling based on statistics of the object size. Then we fine-tine the partially frozen model weights with copy-and-paste augmentation. The 3D points in the box labels are copied from one scene and pasted to the other scenes. Finally, we use the knowledge distillation method to update the student network with a moving average from the teacher network along with a self-training method with pseudo labels. Test-Time Augmentation with varying z values is employed to predict the final results. Our method achieved 3rd place in ECCV 2022 workshop on the 3D Perception for Autonomous Driving challenge."

Lightweight fault diagnosis method in embedded system based on knowledge distillation,2023,['· Fault diagnosis · Knowledge distillation · Lightweight · Embedded system'],,"Deep learning (DL) has garnered attention in mechanical device health management for its ability to accurately identify faults and predict component life. However, its high computational cost presents a significant challenge for resource-limited embedded devices. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight fault diagnosis model based on knowledge distillation. The model employs complex residual networks with high classification accuracy as teachers and simple combinatorial convolutional networks as students. The student model has a similar structure to the teacher model, with fewer layers, and uses pixel-wise convolution and channel-wise convolution instead of the original convolution. Students learn the probability distribution rule of the output layer of teacher models to enhance their fault classification accuracy and achieve model compression. This process is called knowledge distillation. The combination of a lightweight model structure and the model training method of knowledge distillation results in a model that not only achieves higher classification accuracy than other small-sized classical models, but also has faster inference speed in embedded devices."
말벌 검출의 정확성 향상을 위한 YOLOX의  개선된 구조 제안,2023,"['Deep Learning', 'YOLO', 'Real Time', 'Hornet Detection', 'Monitoring System']",,"In this paper, an advanced backbone structure for YOLOX is proposed to obtain better detection accuracy in small object detection such as hornet by replacing CSPLayer with ShuffleLayer. By this replacement, numbers of convolution operation are reduced in each layer of the backbone. This can conserve spatial information of small objects in each layer and through layers in backbone, reducing processing time. In order to evaluate the proposed method, four types of experiments were executed such as mAP comparison for our hornet dataset, another mAP comparison for the standard dataset VEDAI dedicated small objects, generalization test for RTMDet, and detection speed between the default YOLOX model and the proposed YOLOX model. As a result, the first mAP under 50% IoU condition for the hornet dataset showed 86.21% and 87.35% for the default and the proposed, respectively. The experiment, mAP test for the standard VEDAI, represented 47% and 41.7% for each model and also showed better accuracy by 5.3%. In the generalization test with RTMDet, the proposed model showed similar or higher accuracy according to IoU. In addition, in terms of speed the proposed ShuffleLayer- based backbone was faster than the default by 1.35 times due to reduced convolution parameters. Thus, experiments above verified that the proposed backbone structure for YOLOX can be effectively utilized to enhance accuracy and inference speed in real-time detection for small objects."
자율주행 무인항공기의 단안 깊이 추정을 위한 향상된 병렬 sparse-MLP,2023,"['deep learning', 'global dependency', 'local dependency', 'monocular depth estimation', 'multi-scale context', 'uav']",,"Estimating a high-quality depth map from a single RGB image is a challenging task due to its ill-posed nature. Recently, two dominant trends in computer vision have been the subject of extensive research: attention mechanisms and multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based vision models. Attention mechanisms, especially multi-head attention (MHA), have demonstrated significant improvements in depth estimation. MHA excels in capturing long-distance information and pixel relationships, yet its complexity quadratically increases with spatial resolution. Consequently, applying MHA to unmanned aerial vehicles with limited hardware resources is infeasible. In contrast, MLP-based vision models offer faster inference due to their linear computational complexity concerning spatial resolution. However, the inherent weakness of the MLP’s inductive bias can hinder generalization without a substantial amount of data. Moreover, the absence of location-dependent local dependencies can hinder the precise estimation of locally detailed depth maps. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel module called EPsMLP (Enhanced Parallel sparse-MLP), which consists of three parallel branches, including sparse-MLP, local sparse attention, and channel attention. This module can capture global and local dependencies while benefiting from the inductive bias on locality. Furthermore, multi-scale convolutions are used to extract context at various scales for diverse objects. The architecture adopts an encoder-decoder-based structure, incorporating a pre-trained DenseNet-121 encoder. Experimental evaluations were conducted using the NYU-Depth-V2 and KITTI datasets, which are commonly used in monocular depth estimation. The extensive results demonstrate that our network is more efficient and effective than previously proposed methods."

Recently, research using AI-based image classification models has been actively conducted to measure consumers' immersion and emotional states. However, existing datasets consist of information collected from subjects in an immersed state, making it difficult to discern non-immersive states, and are composed mostly of Westerners, so it is difficult to train the model to learn the characteristic differences based on race and culture. Therefore, this study compared and analyzed the results derived by training the model using a self-dataset constructed by preprocessing collected Korean, foreign, and mixed image datasets for emotions and non-immersion states to measure the immersion state of Korean visitors and use it to evaluate quantitative satisfaction with the content."

Nevertheless, it is labor-intensive and time-consuming, requiring researchers to quantify species and populations. In this study, we aimed to improve the preprocessing of camera trapping data by utilizing an object detection algorithm. Wildlife monitoring using unmanned sensor cameras was conducted in a forested urban forest and a green space on a university campus in Cheonan City, Chungcheongnam-do, Korea. The collected camera trapping data were classified by a researcher to identify the occurrence of species. The data was then used to test the performance of the YOLO-X object detection algorithm for wildlife detection. The camera trapping resulted in 10,500 images of the urban forest and 51,974 images of green spaces on campus. Out of the total 62,474 images, 52,993 images (84.82%) were found to be false positives, while 9,481 images (15.18%) were found to contain wildlife. As a result of wildlife monitoring, 19 species of birds, 5 species of mammals, and 1 species of reptile were observed within the study area. In addition, there were statistically significant differences in the frequency of occurrence of the following species according to the type of urban greenery: Parus varius(t = -3.035, p < 0.01), Parus major(t = 2.112, p < 0.05), Passer montanus(t = 2.112, p < 0.05), Paradoxornis webbianus(t = 2.112, p < 0.05), Turdus hortulorum(t = -4.026, p < 0.001), and Sitta europaea(t = -2.189, p < 0.05).

While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based text recognition networks have demonstrated commendable performance, they grapple with the aforementioned challenges. Recently, transformer-based feature extractors have exhibited advantages in global feature extraction from images, especially in the context of irregular text images. By employing self-attention, these transformers establish information connections between different parts of the image, thereby mitigating the impact of uneven character distribution. This study proposes multi-encoder scene text recognition (MESTR), a hybrid approach that combines a CNN-based and a transformer-based feature extractor. MESTR excels in simultaneously extracting local and global features from text images, ensuring the integration of both types of features to enhance performance. During training, we employed a guiding connectionist temporal classification (CTC) decoder [6] as a compensatory training strategy for the attentional decoder. Our experiments showed the efficacy of MESTR across seven benchmarks, demonstrating robust performance. In addition, ablation experiments are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for scene text recognition."

Major works adopt transformer-based approach show excellent performances, but they used a basic transformer only. In this paper, we suggest the various techniques to improve the transformer-based Re-ID method for the occluded person as follows. First, after extracting the heatmap and then deleting random body parts on the heat map, accurate keypoint information is obtained in data augmentation. Second, Cross-attention between the keypoint heatmap and the output of the transformer's middle layer is provided to focus more on the non-occluded person area. Third K-menas clustering is utilized to enhance the representation of local features, and the structure of the network is proposed to improve the diversity of the features.

Attention for Adaptive Convolution in Convolutional Neural Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution,2023,"['Deep learning', 'Convolutional Neural Network', 'Single Image Super-resolution', 'Adaptive Convolution', 'Attention']",,"There have been many works on single image super-resolution (SISR) using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), researching on network architecture, loss function, applications, etc. However, very few have studied the modification or adaptation of the convolution operation, which is the fundamental element of CNN. In most CNN-based methods, the filter weights do not change at the inference phase, i.e., filter parameters are fixed regardless of the input and its regional characteristics. We note that this conventional approach is parameter-efficient but may not be optimal in performance due to its inflexibility to regionally different input statistics. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel convolution operation named Adaptive Convolution, which has content-specific characteristics. The proposed method adaptively adjusts filter weights according to the regional characteristics of the input with the help of an attention mechanism. We also introduce a kernel fragmentation method, which enables the efficient implementation of the Adaptive Convolution. We embed our new convolutional layer into several well-known SR networks and show that it enhances their performances while requiring a small number of additional parameters. Also, our method can be used along with other attentions that manipulate the features, further increasing the performance."

The usefulness of variational autoencoders (VAE) in learning the speaker-specific prosody representations for the speaker recognition task is examined herein for the first time. The speech signal is first automatically segmented into syllable-like units using vowel onset points (VOP) and energy valleys. Prosodic features, such as the dynamics of duration, energy, and fundamental frequency (F<sub>0</sub>), are then extracted at the syllable level and used to train/adapt a speaker-dependent VAE from a universal VAE. The initial comparative studies on VAEs and traditional autoencoders (AE) suggest that the former can efficiently learn speaker representations. Investigations on the impact of gender information in speaker recognition also point out that gender-dependent impostor banks lead to higher accuracies.

In accordance with increasing global necessity of constant monitoring and accurate forecasting of air pollution among governments and institutions, research into applying transformer-based models to predict pollutants preceded. However, the models have been limited in their ability to thoroughly consider local information within periodicity, which is one of the key inherent patterns in pollution data. To address the limitation, this paper proposes MPC(Multiple Periodicity Consideration)-TimesNet model designed to handle intricate locality information within periodicity by considering not only low frequencies information, but also that of high frequencies. The proposed model added HFEM(High Frequency Extraction Module) to the previous TimesNet model in order to exquisitely account for high frequencies data. In addition, we lowered the size of representations as the self-information gets smaller to address noise issues. To evaluate our model, we collected data of five air pollutants (NO2, OZ, CO2, SO2, PM10) among three regions―Songpa-gu, Youngdeungpo-gu, Jung-gu―in Seoul.

Our experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a performance improvement of up to 8.9 mIoU compared to the baseline model even under extreme modality-damaging conditions."

The CNN extracts the feature for road surface throughout convolution and pooling process and classifies the road surface type in fully connected neural network. Two road surfaces, snow road and asphalt road, are classified using a method that combines the CWT and CNN methods The results indicate an accuracy of over 97 %. Two different tires are used for the experiment. Results from the road classification can be used to control the braking systems of autonomous vehicle in future."

Although it shows promising results on many benchmarks and competitions, NAS still suffers from its demanding computation cost for searching in high dimensional architectural design space, and this problem becomes worse when we want to use large-scale datasets. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach to measuring the importance of each training sample on NAS process and making a reliable proxy data, which is a small subset of the original data and thus reduces the computational cost. The idea behind proxy data comes from our observation that each sample has a different impact on NAS process and most of the examples are redundant when we compare the relative accuracy of possible network configurations. Our experimental results show that we can preserve almost the same accuracy ranking among all possible network configurations with proxy data consisting of 5–10% of the original dataset. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed method is the first attempt to make a reliable proxy data for NAS in a systematic manner."

Extraction of line objects from piping and instrumentation diagrams using an improved continuous line detection algorithm,2023,['· Deep learning · Line · Image processing · Object recognition · Piping and instrumentation diagram'],,"Digitizing image-format piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) consists of a step for detecting the information objects that constitute P&IDs, which identifies connection relationships between the detected objects, and a step for creating digital P&IDs. This paper presents a P&ID line object extraction method that uses an improved continuous line detection algorithm to extract the information objects that constitute P&IDs. The improved continuous line detection algorithm reduces the time spent performing line extraction by edge detection that employs a differential filter. It is also used to detect continuous lines in the vertical, horizontal, and diagonal directions. Additionally, it processes diagonal continuous lines after performing image differentiation to handle short continuous lines, which are a major cause of misdetection when detecting diagonal continuous lines. The P&ID line object extraction method that incorporates this algorithm consists of three steps. The preprocessing step removes the diagram’s outline borders and heading areas. Second, the detection step detects continuous lines and then detects the special signs that are needed to distinguish different types of lines. Third, the postprocessing step uses the detected line signs to identify detected continuous lines, which must be converted to other types of lines, and their types are changed. Finally, the lines and the flow arrow detection information are merged. To verify the proposed method, an image-format P&ID line extraction system prototype was implemented, and line extraction tests were conducted. In nine test P&IDs, the overall average precision and recall were 95.26 % and 91.25 %, respectively, demonstrating good line extraction performance."

In this study, we propose a system that recommends Korean journals for submission. Firstly, we utilize SBERT (Sentence BERT) to embed abstracts of previously published papers at the document level, compare the similarity between new documents and published papers, and recommend journals accordingly. Next, the order of recommended journals is determined by considering the similarity of abstracts, keywords, and title. Subsequently, journals that are similar to the top recommended journal from previous stage are added by using a dictionary of words constructed for each journal, thereby enhancing recommendation diversity. The recommendation system, built using this approach, achieved a Top-10 accuracy level of 76.6%, and the validity of the recommendation results was confirmed through user feedback. Furthermore, it was found that each step of the proposed framework contributes to improving recommendation accuracy.

Data preprocessing included variable selection and sample balancing, and LASSO was used for feature selection. The model used 5 hidden layers, dropout and batch normalization and was evaluated using evaluation scores such as accuracy and recall score calculated from a confusion matrix.Results Models were trained and evaluated to predict OP using selected features including age, quality of life index, weight, grip strength and average working hours per week.

Among them, anomaly detection is a promising application of image defect analysis. The purpose of the detector is to find the out-of-distribution when predicting the probability of a DL network for abnormal samples, after some normal sample images are given for training. Geometric transformation (GT) based anomaly detection is one of the recent best methods for classifying abnormal samples among many normal ones. However, the GT method training process is unstable and too inaccurate to be used in industrial applications. The goal of this study is to suggest a method to improve the performance of a GT-based anomaly detector (GTnet). Using observations of GTnet behavior and its training properties, we propose the addition of three techniques that can improve anomaly detection performance for defect inspection in a factory production process. Specifically, k-Winners-Take-All (kWTA) was applied to the GTnet base model to resist data corruption such as dust on the sample, the temperature scaling method was added to consider correlations between GT classes with similar appearance, and loss redefinition was applied to improve the efficiency of optimal training. Accuracy was improved from 98.56% to 99.86% in the inspection of vehicle part assembly defects, which requires extremely high accuracy.

GEase-K: 부가 정보를 활용한 선형 및비선형 오토인코더 기반의 추천시스템,2023,"['Recommender Systems', 'Deep Learning', 'Autoencoder', 'Side Information', 'Sparsity Problem', '추천시스템', '딥러닝', '오토인코더', '부가 정보', '희소성 문제']",,"In the recent field of recommendation systems, various studies have been conducted to model sparse data effectively. Among these, GLocal-K(Global and Local Kernels for Recommender Systems) is a research endeavor combining global and local kernels to provide personalized recommendations by considering global data patterns and individual user characteristics. However, due to its utilization of kernel tricks, GLocal-K exhibits diminished performance on highly sparse data and struggles to offer recommendations for new users or items due to the absence of side information. In this paper, to address these limitations of GLocal-K, we propose the GEase-K (Global and EASE kernels for Recommender Systems) model, incorporating the EASE(Embarrassingly Shallow Autoencoders for Sparse Data) model and leveraging side information. Initially, we substitute EASE for the local kernel in GLocal-K to enhance recommendation performance on highly sparse data. EASE, functioning as a simple linear operational structure, is an autoencoder that performs highly on extremely sparse data through regularization and learning item similarity. Additionally, we utilize side information to alleviate the cold-start problem. We enhance the understanding of user-item similarities by employing a conditional autoencoder structure during the training process to incorporate side information. In conclusion, GEase-K demonstrates resilience in highly sparse data and cold-start situations by combining linear and nonlinear structures and utilizing side information. Experimental results show that GEase-K outperforms GLocal-K based on the RMSE and MAE metrics on the highly sparse GoodReads and ModCloth datasets. Furthermore, in cold-start experiments divided into four groups using the GoodReads and ModCloth datasets, GEase-K denotes superior performance compared to GLocal-K."

Improving Adversarial Domain Adaptation with Mixup Regularization,2023,"['Adversarial discriminative domain adaptation (ADDA)', 'Domain-invariant', 'Mixup', 'Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)']",,"Engineers prefer deep neural networks (DNNs) for solving computer vision problems. However, DNNs pose two major problems. First, neural networks require large amounts of well-labeled data for training. Second, the covariate shift problem is common in computer vision problems. Domain adaptation has been proposed to mitigate this problem. Recent work on adversarial-learning-based unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has explained transferability and enabled the model to learn robust features. Despite this advantage, current methods do not guarantee the distinguishability of the latent space unless they consider class-aware information of the target domain. Furthermore, source and target examples alone cannot efficiently extract domain-invariant features from the encoded spaces. To alleviate the problems of existing UDA methods, we propose the mixup regularization in adversarial discriminative domain adaptation (ADDA) method.

확률적 교차 연산을 이용한 보편적 관계 추출,2023,"['Relation Extraction', 'Deep Learning', 'Pre-Trained Language Model', 'Probabilistic Crossover', '관계 추출', '심층 학습', '사전학습 언어모델', '확률적 교차 연산']",,"Relation extraction is to extract relationships between named entities from text. Traditionally, relation extraction methods only extract relations between predetermined subject and object entities. However, in end-to-end relation extraction, all possible relations must be extracted by considering the positions of the subject and object for each pair of entities, and so this method uses time and resources inefficiently. To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes a method that sets directions based on the positions of the subject and object, and extracts relations according to the directions. The proposed method utilizes existing relation extraction data to generate direction labels indicating the direction in which the subject points to the object in the sentence, adds entity position tokens and entity type to sentences to predict the directions using a pre-trained language model (KLUE-RoBERTa-base, RoBERTa-base), and generates representations of subject and object entities through probabilistic crossover operation. Then, we make use of these representations to extract relations. Experimental results show that the proposed model performs about 3 ~ 4%p better than a method for predicting integrated labels. In addition, when learning Korean and English data using the proposed model, the performance was 1.7%p higher in English than in Korean due to the number of data and language disorder and the values of the parameters that produce the best performance were different. By excluding the number of directional cases, the proposed model can reduce the waste of resources in end-to-end relation extraction."

However, the current shortage of welfare personnel has emerged as a social issue. To address this challenge, there is active research underway on elderly care robots designed to mitigate the social isolation of the elderly and provide emergency contact capabilities in critical situations. Nonetheless, these functionalities require direct user contact, which represents a limitation of conventional elderly care robots. In this paper, we propose a solution to overcome these challenges by introducing a care robot system capable of interacting with users without the need for direct physical contact. This system leverages commercialized elderly care robots and cameras. We have equipped the care robot with an edge device that incorporates facial expression recognition and action recognition models. The models were trained and validated using public available data. Experimental results demonstrate high accuracy rates, with facial expression recognition achieving 96.5% accuracy and action recognition reaching 90.9%. Furthermore, the inference times for these processes are 50ms and 350ms, respectively. These findings affirm that our proposed system offers efficient and accurate facial and action recognition, enabling seamless interaction even in non-contact situations."

Three dentomaxillofacial radiologists and the Diagnocat AI software evaluated these PRs. The evaluations were focused on various dental conditions and treatments, including canal filling, caries, cast post and core, dental calculus, fillings, furcation lesions, implants, lack of interproximal tooth contact, open margins, overhangs, periapical lesions, periodontal bone loss, short fillings, voids in root fillings, overfillings, pontics, root fragments, impacted teeth, artificial crowns, missing teeth, and healthy teeth.Results: The AI demonstrated almost perfect agreement (exceeding 0.81) in most of the assessments when compared to the ground truth. The sensitivity was very high (above 0.8) for the evaluation of healthy teeth, artificial crowns, dental calculus, missing teeth, fillings, lack of interproximal contact, periodontal bone loss, and implants. However, the sensitivity was low for the assessment of caries, periapical lesions, pontic voids in the root canal, and overhangs.Conclusion: Despite the limitations of this study, the synthesized data suggest that AI-based decision support systems can serve as a valuable tool in detecting dental conditions, when used with PR for clinical dental applications."

The proposed traffic signal timing design model was developed using a training dataset and an ANN learning process. To determine the difference between the traditional pre-time model primarily used in practice and the proposed model, a comparison test was conducted with historical data obtained for a month at a specific intersection in Uiwang, Korea.RESULTS : The test results revealed that the proposed method could reduce control delays for most of the day compared to the existing methods, excluding the peak hour periods when control delays were similar. This is because existing methods focus only on peak times in practice.CONCLUSIONS : The results indicate that the proposed method enhances the performance of traffic signal systems because it rapidly provides alternatives for all-day cycle periods. This would also reduce the management cost (repeated field data collection) required to increase the performance to that level. A robust traffic-signal timing design model (e.g., ANN) is required to handle various combinations of directional demands."

This has enabled real-time AI-aided detection of polyps with a higher sensitivity than the average endoscopist, and evidence to support its use has been promising thus far. This review article provides a summary of currently published data relating to AI-aided colonoscopy, discusses current clinical applications, and introduces ongoing research directions.

외형특징 추출 기능을 개선한 딥러닝 기반의 다중객체 추적,2023,"['Multi-object Tracking', 'Deep Learning', 'Object Detection', 'ID classification', 'TITAN Dataset']",,"Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) aims to track the trajectories of multiple objects simultaneously in a video over time. In MOT, object detection is used to locate instances of objects in images or videos, and re-identification is employed to match objects with the same ID. Among recent MOT methods, one-shot MOT, which relies on a single neck and head for object detection and appearance feature extraction, faces a conflict between object category classification and unique ID classification. To address this challenge, we propose a solution that integrates an FPN neck-based appearance feature extraction module into YOLOX. This method effectively mitigates the conflict between object category classification and unique ID classification in one-shot MOT. Furthermore, the proposed variable offset mechanism enables correction of the extraction position, even in cases of object occlusion. The proposed technique achieved 83.7% mIDF1 and 75% mMOTA in the experimental results for the TITAN dataset. This improved mIDF1 and mMOTA by 0.2% and 0.2% respectively over the IOU-based MOT, and by 1.2% and 0.7% respectively over the one-shot MOT."
Dorsal Hand Vein Pattern Recognition: A Comparison between Manual and Automatic Segmentation Methods,2023,"['Biometrics', 'Veins', 'Classification', 'Deep Learning', 'Transfer Learning']",,"Objectives: Various techniques for dorsal hand vein (DHV) pattern extraction have been introduced using small datasetswith poor and inconsistent segmentation. This work compared manual segmentation with our proposed hybrid automaticsegmentation method (HHM) for this classification problem. Methods: Manual segmentation involved selecting a region-ofinterest(ROI) in images from the Bosphorus dataset to generate ground truth data. The HHM combined histogram equalizationand morphological and thresholding-based algorithms to localize veins from hand images. The data were divided intotraining, validation, and testing sets with an 8:1:1 ratio before training AlexNet. We considered three image augmentationstrategies to enlarge our training sets. The best training hyperparameters were found using the manually segmented dataset.Results: We obtained a good test accuracy (91.5%) using the model trained with manually segmented images. The HHMmethod showed slightly inferior performance (76.5%). Considerable improvement was observed in the test accuracy of themodel trained with the inclusion of automatically segmented and augmented images (84%), with low false acceptance andfalse rejection rates (0.00035% and 0.095%, respectively). A comparison with past studies further demonstrated the competitivenessof our technique. Conclusions: Our technique can be feasible for extracting the ROI in DHV images. This strategyprovides higher consistency and greater efficiency than the manual approach."
Assembling three one-camera images for three-camera intersection classification,2023,"['augmentation', 'computer vision', 'deep learning', 'intersection classification', 'transfer learning']",,"Determining whether an autonomous self-driving agent is in the middle of an intersection can be extremely difficult when relying on visual input taken from a single camera. In such a problem setting, a wider range of views is essential, which drives us to use three cameras positioned in the front, left, and right of an agent for better intersection recognition. However, collecting adequate training data with three cameras poses several practical difficulties; hence, we propose using data collected from one camera to train a three-camera model, which would enable us to more easily compile a variety of training data to endow our model with improved generalizability. In this work, we provide three separate fusion methods (feature, early, and late) of combining the information from three cameras. Extensive pedestrian-view intersection classification experiments show that our feature fusion model provides an area under the curve and F1-score of 82.00 and 46.48, respectively, which considerably outperforms contemporary three- and one-camera models."
Pore Structure Identification Method for Pervious Concrete based on Improved UNet and Fusion Algorithm,2023,"['Pervious concrete', 'Pore identification', 'Deep learning', 'UNet', 'Fusion algorithm']",,"This paper aims to establish an automatic and accurate pore identification method for pervious concrete. The residual module and mixed loss functions were introduced to the original UNet network to obtain the improved UNet. CT scanning was conducted on the six groups of pervious concrete samples with different aggregate sizes to obtain the initial dataset. The initial dataset was marked and enhanced, and then the pore recognition model was trained. The influence of image brightness and contrast on pore identification was analyzed. The fusion algorithm was used to improve the robustness of the model. The results show that during model training, R-UNet began to converge 20 epochs earlier than UNet and the loss value was smaller. Moreover, the maximum increase of mIoU and mDice was 10.3% and 11.7% respectively, and the maximum decrease of mHD was 14.1%. The fusion algorithm could improve the segmentation accuracy of pores in brightness anomaly images. Compared with threshold segmentation method, the method proposed in this paper could improve the accuracy of pore edge segmentation and the “fine pores” identification, and reduced the pore identification defects. The value of mHD was decreased by 48.7% − 72.4%, and the efficiency of pore identification was greatly improved."

Computer-aided diagnosis system based on multi-scale feature fusion for screening large-scale gastrointestinal diseases,2023,"['computer-aided diagnosis', 'deep learning', 'transformer', 'convolutional neural network', 'gastrointestinal diseases']",,"For endoscopists, large-scale screening of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases is arduous and time-consuming. While their workload and human factor-induced errors can be reduced by computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems, the existing ones mainly focus on a limited number of lesions or specific organs, making them unsuitable for diagnosing various GI diseases in large-scale disease screening. This paper proposes a transformer and convolutional neural network-based CAD system (called TransMSF) to assist endoscopists in diagnosing multiple GI diseases. This system constructs two feature extraction paths with different coding methods to obtain the lesions’ global and local information. In addition, downsampling is implemented in transformer to get global information of different scales, further enriching the feature representation and reducing the amount of computation and memory occupation. Moreover, a channel and spatial attention module with fewer parameters was successfully designed to pay more attention to the target and reduce the loss of important information during spatial dimension transformation. Finally, the extracted feature information is fused through the feature fusion module and then input into the linear classifier for disease diagnosis. The proposed system outperformed that of other state-of-the-art models on two datasets, reaching a 98.41% precision, a 98.15% recall, a 98.13% accuracy, and a 98.28% F1 score on the in-house GI dataset versus a 95.88% precision, a 95.88% recall, a 98.97% accuracy, and a 95.88% F1 score on the public Kvasir dataset. Moreover, TransMSF’s performance was superior to that of seasoned endoscopists. The above results prove that the proposed system is instrumental in diagnosing GI diseases in large-scale disease screening. It can also be used as a training tool for junior endoscopists to improve their professional skills by rendering helpful suggestions."

Language patterns, in particular, can be easily recognized. In this paper, we propose a platform that accurately analyzes the voices of stroke patients with neurogenic bladder, enabling early detection and prevention of the condition.Methods: In this study, we developed an artificial intelligence-based speech analysis diagnostic system to assess the risk of stroke associated with neurogenic bladder disease in elderly individuals. The proposed method involves recording the voice of a stroke patient while they speak a specific sentence, analyzing it to extract unique feature data, and then offering a voice alarm service through a mobile application. The system processes and classifies abnormalities, and issues alarm events based on analyzed voice data.Results: In order to assess the performance of the software, we first obtained the validation accuracy and training accuracy from the training data.

In-depth Recommendation Model Based on Self-Attention Factorization,2023,"['Self-attention network', 'deep learning', 'recommendation model', 'review text']",,"Rating prediction is an important issue in recommender systems, and its accuracy affects the experience of the user and the revenue of the company. Traditional recommender systems use Factorization Machines for rating predictions and each feature is selected with the same weight.

This study proposes a deep recommendation model based on self-attention Factorization (SAFMR) to solve these problems. Thismodel uses Convolutional Neural Networks to extract features from user and item reviews. The obtained features are fed into self-attention mechanism Factorization Machines, where the self-attention network automatically learns the dependencies of the features and distinguishes the weights of the different features, thereby reducing the prediction error.

Density Change Adaptive Congestive Scene Recognition Network,2023,"['People Counting', 'Congestive Scene', 'Deep Learning', 'CCTV']",,"In recent times, an absence of effective crowd management has led to numerous stampede incidents in crowded places. A crucial component for enhancing on-site crowd management effectiveness is the utilization of crowd counting technology. Current approaches to analyzing congested scenes have evolved beyond simple crowd counting, which outputs the number of people in the targeted image to a density map. This development aligns with the demands of real-life applications, as the same number of people can exhibit vastly different crowd distributions. Therefore, solely counting the number of crowds is no longer sufficient. CSRNet stands out as one representative method within this advanced category of approaches. In this paper, we propose a crowd counting network which is adaptive to the change in the density of people in the scene, addressing the performance degradation issue observed in the existing CSRNet(Congested Scene Recognition Network) when there are changes in density. To overcome the weakness of the CSRNet, we introduce a system that takes input from the image's information and adjusts the output of CSRNet based on the features extracted from the image. This aims to improve the algorithm's adaptability to changes in density, supplementing the shortcomings identified in the original CSRNet."

Since the Korean military went into service, there has been a need to change the configuration and improve performance of a large number of software and hardware, but there is no verification system for the impact on interoperability, and there are no related test tools and facilities. In addition, during combined and joint training, errors frequently occur during use after arbitrarily changing the detailed operation method and software of the weapon/power support system. Therefore, periodic verification of interoperability between weapon systems is necessary.

Recently, the deterioration of Vietnam's economic situation, including the US-China conflict, has caused a major downturn in Korean exporters along with the depreciation of the Korean Won. Therefore, this study aims to help manage their exchange rate risks by predicting the trends of the exchange rates of 8 major exporting countries based on Transformer-MAF, which has shown the highest performance in multivariate exchange rate prediction studies. However, the Transformer-MAF only conveys overall contextual information to the model through an single linear embedding module, and fails to emphasize the contextual information important for predicting the fluctuation trend of each country. Therefore, we proposed a Dilated Temporal Dependency Embedding module to the Transformer-MAF to enable effective multivariate long-term prediction based on various dependency relationships at adjacent time points. The proposed embedding module consists of a high-dimensional linear projection layer that can extract comprehensive contextual information of each country, and successive randomized masking and dilated conv blocks that deliver the various contextual information from different neighboring time points in each forward propagation. Experimental results show that the proposed model has the smallest standard deviation and outperforms all comparison models with a 0.75987 CRPSsum (±0.00202), provinging that effective multivariate exchange rate forecasting is possible with only a small increase in computation."

Arabic Words Extraction and Character Recognition from Picturesque Image Macros with Enhanced VGG-16 based Model Functionality Using Neural Networks,2023,"['Arabic Characters Recognition', 'AWARD', 'Deep learning', 'Scenic Images Dataset', 'VGG-16', 'Neural Networks']",,"Innovation and rapid increased functionality in user friendly smartphones has encouraged shutterbugs to have picturesque image macros while in work environment or during travel. Formal signboards are placed with marketing objectives and are enriched with text for attracting people. Extracting and recognition of the text from natural images is an emerging research issue and needs consideration. When compared to conventional optical character recognition (OCR), the complex background, implicit noise, lighting, and orientation of these scenic text photos make this problem more difficult. Arabic language text scene extraction and recognition adds a number of complications and difficulties. The method described in this paper uses a two-phase methodology to extract Arabic text and word boundaries awareness from scenic images with varying text orientations. The first stage uses a convolution auto-encoder, and the second uses Arabic Character Segmentation (ACS), which is followed by traditional two-layer neural networks for recognition. This study presents the way that how can an Arabic training and synthetic dataset be created for exemplify the superimposed text in different scene images. For this purpose a dataset of size 10K of cropped images has been created in the detection phase wherein Arabic text was found and 127k Arabic character dataset for the recognition phase. The phase-1 labels were generated from an Arabic corpus of quotes and sentences, which consists of 15kquotes and sentences. This study ensures that Arabic Word Awareness Region Detection (AWARD) approach with high flexibility in identifying complex Arabic text scene images, such as texts that are arbitrarily oriented, curved, or deformed, is used to detect these texts. Our research after experimentations shows that the system has a 91.8% word segmentation accuracy and a 94.2% character recognition accuracy. We believe in the future that the researchers will excel in the field of image processing while treating text images to improve or reduce noise by processing scene images in any language by enhancing the functionality of VGG-16 based model using Neural Networks."

Materials and Methods: An online search was performed of the PubMed, Science Direct, and Scopus databases. Based on the selection process, 12 studies were included in this review. Results: Eleven studies utilized a CNN model for detection tasks, 5 for classification tasks, and 3 for segmentation tasks in the context of tooth numbering on panoramic radiographs. Most of these studies revealed high performance of various CNN models in automating tooth numbering. However, several studies also highlighted limitations of CNNs, such as the presence of false positives and false negatives in identifying decayed teeth, teeth with crown prosthetics, teeth adjacent to edentulous areas, dental implants, root remnants, wisdom teeth, and root canal-treated teeth. These limitations can be overcome by ensuring both the quality and quantity of datasets, as well as optimizing the CNN architecture. Conclusion: CNNs have demonstrated high performance in automated tooth numbering on panoramic radiographs. Future development of CNN-based models for this purpose should also consider different stages of dentition, such as the primary and mixed dentition stages, as well as the presence of various tooth conditions. Ultimately, an optimized CNN architecture can serve as the foundation for an automated tooth numbering system and for further artificial intelligence research on panoramic radiographs for a variety of purposes."

In order to protect users from unpleasant experiences, online portal sites employ database-driven profanity filters to render offensive content invisible. However, these filters often fall short in preventing instances where individuals insult others by judging certain words, not classified as profanity, as offensive within a specific context. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a precedent-based insult sentence analysis system, utilizing advanced natural language processing techniques. The system leverages a deep learning model, rooted in precedents, to infer the likelihood of guilt associated with an insult sentence. Furthermore, the system presents users with comparable precedents through similarity analysis.

The results revealed that BERT exhibits human-like syntactic processing by attending to the presence of a comma, showing sensitivity to transitivity, and reanalyzing misinterpretations, despite initially lacking sensitivity to plausibility. By concentrating on attention maps, the present study provides valuable insights into the inner workings of BERT and contributes to a deeper understanding of how advanced neural language models acquire and process complex linguistic structures."

Enhanced Adversarial Attack for Avoidance of Fake Image Detection,2023,"['Multimedia forensics', 'anti-forensic attacks', 'deep learning', 'generative adversarial network']",,"Image forensics is one of the most emerging topics in multimedia forensics to ensure the integrity of image content. Anti-forensic (AF) attacks, particularly generative adversarial network (GAN)-based attacks on fake images, can make forensic methods vulnerable. However, the effectiveness of AF attacks is limited to certain training conditions such as datasets, forensic methods, and attack types. Even though an AF attack is applied to misguide the forensic methods, forensic methods can be again updated using the AF dataset, which continues an infinite loop. This paper proposes an improved AF attack that can misguide all forensic methods. We update the forensic methods multiple times with multiple AF datasets and build an AF model that learns different forensic methods updated at different times. The experiments show that the proposed AF attack successfully deceives all forensic methods."

Achieving full autonomy in these tractors poses a crucial challenge, notably in accurately detecting person in safety-critical situations. Detecting fallen person is vital for preventing potentially fatal accidents. However, a scarcity of data related to fallen person has raised concerns about overfitting. To address this issue, this paper introduces a new data augmentation method for identifying fallen person using a Automated RoI(Region of Interest) Copy-Paste method, based on Intersection over Union(IoU). The Automated RoI Copy-Paste method uses IoU to automatically segment and set the RoI areas. Subsequently, it composites the segmented masked images within those areas. Furthermore, it utilizes YOLOv8x-seg and Grounded-SAM models to generate masks for fallen person and vehicle bonnets.

Aptamers are single-strand oligonucleotides that comprise tertiary structures and bind to specific target proteins. Aptamers are considered safer and more stable than traditional biomaterials.

In this paper, we propose a new method that improves on the existing method, reduces motion blur with high confidence detection results, and utilizes a pose reconstruction method that is robust to appearance changes to extract features. Based on these features, the similarity between human subjects in subsequent frames is measured and the best match is determined.

However, these methods are both costly and time-consuming, so hull-form designers use statistical methods for a quick feed-back during the early design stage. It is well known that results from statistical methods are often less accurate compared to those from CFD simulations or model tests. To overcome this problem, this study suggests a new approach using a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) with voxelized hull-form data. By converting the original Computer Aided Design (CAD) data into three dimensional voxels, the CNN is able to abstract the hull-form data, focusing only on important features. For the verification, suggested method in this study was compared to a parametric method that uses hull parameters such as length overall and block coefficient as inputs. The results showed that the use of voxelized data significantly improves resistance performance prediction accuracy, compared to the parametric approach."
Improving performance of medical image alignment through super-resolution,2023,"['Image registration', 'Super resolution', 'Similarity function', 'Deep learning', 'Image processing']",,"Medical image alignment is an important tool for tracking patient conditions, but the quality of alignment is influenced bythe effectiveness of low-dose Cone-beam CT (CBCT) imaging and patient characteristics. To address these two issues, wepropose an unsupervised alignment method that incorporates a preprocessing super-resolution process. We constructed themodel based on a private clinical dataset and validated the enhancement of the super-resolution on alignment using clinicaland public data. Through all three experiments, we demonstrate that higher resolution data yields better results in the alignmentprocess. To fully constrain similarity and structure, a new loss function is proposed; Pearson correlation coefficientcombined with regional mutual information. In all test samples, the newly proposed loss function obtains higher resultsthan the common loss function and improve alignment accuracy. Subsequent experiments verified that, combined with thenewly proposed loss function, the super-resolution processed data boosts alignment, can reaching up to 9.58%. Moreover,this boost is not limited to a single model, but is effective in different alignment models. These experiments demonstratethat the unsupervised alignment method with super-resolution preprocessing proposed in this study effectively improvedalignment and plays an important role in tracking different patient conditions over time."

In addition, in the case of colloquial data, there are many non-grammatical data, so after learning, the model may not understand the sentence when it receives a sentence that is not a standard language as an input. Therefore, in order to solve these problems, this paper proposes an augmented method that preserves the label of sentence data, enhances data, and adds non-grammatical sentences to the original data."

However, despite the increasing spread of smartphones and the activation of research using smartphone sensors, research on character recognition methods using signals with variable length is still at a standstill. The reason is that even with the same motion, the length of the signal is always different, making it difficult to process. To solve the problem, the study proposes a method of recognizing characters using an object detection neural network as a classifier. In this study, five different subjects collect data by drawing three alphabets, I, S, and Z letters 100 times each in the air and the collected data is used to train an object detection neural network and to evaluate the performance of the network. The data changes into images through denoising and normalization. Third-order spline interpolation and Fourier transform are used to remove noise from the raw signal. The values of the acceleration sensors x, y, and z axes correspond to the values of the R, G, and B channels of an image, respectively. As a result of evaluating character recognition performance by applying image data to YOLOv5, it showed an average accuracy of 99% for three characters."

Existing methods have limitations in that they use many sensors for development or require a large installation space, which results in high construction costs. Therefore, in this study, we propose an object-volume measurement system based on image segmentation using a two-dimensional (2D) camera and a time-of-flight (TOF) sensor. The proposed system captures product images using a 2D camera and determines the pixel area of the product using an image-segmentation model. The height of the product is then obtained using a TOF sensor, and the horizontal and vertical lengths of the object are output through a conversion equation that converts one pixel to millimeters based on the height information. The proposed system has the advantage of low construction costs because it does not require expensive equipment such as 3D cameras or radio detection and ranging (RADAR) and can be easily installed in various environments. Thus, it is possible to easily build a volume measurement system, even with a limited structure, contributing to logistics automation."

However, most previouslypublished remote sensing benchmark datasets represent spatial resolution within approximately 10 meters,imposing limitations when directly applying for super-resolution of small objects with cm unit spatial resolution.Furthermore, if the dataset lacks a global spatial distribution and is specialized in particular land covers, theconsequent lack of feature diversity can directly impact the quantitative performance and prevent the formationof robust foundation models. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a method to generate benchmarkdatasets by simulating the modulation transfer functions of the sensor.

Particularly, when learning traditional folktales, it's essential to consider how past values manifest in the modern context through a chronological lens. By comparing early written records that detailed the orally transmitted content and various adaptations in subsequent published versions such as traditional narratives and elementary school textbooks, this study identify the shifts and changes in values. The results of the analysis show that the folktale <The Brother and Sister Who Became the Sun and the Moon> encompasses values related to maternal love, retribution against wrongdoers personified in a tiger, values of wisdom and overcoming challenges, the concept of righteous vengeance, loyalty and belief, sibling camaraderie, and the emphasized values of independence and autonomy in later generations. To incorporate these values effectively into Korean language classes, this study suggests a cross-cultural approach that involves comparing folktales from diverse cultural backgrounds. This approach fosters an understanding of both the uniqueness and universality of cultures, promoting deep mutual cultural comprehension and respect through well-structured lessons. Furthermore, this study proposes designing lessons that consider the contemporaneity of folktales' values within a temporal context.

South Korean military has also been making efforts to maintain combat readiness through the development of unmanned aerial vehicles. However, proper and accurate forecasting of maintenance accessories procurement is required for UAV development and deployment, which can eventually contribute to combat readiness. For a long time, the ROK army has used the data set in the equipment maintenance information system to forecast the demand of maintenance subordinates estimated by the several time series method. Nevertheless, more accurate forecasting methods need to be established and implemented. In this study, we applied the ensemble method for military industry demand forecasting, which is performed by the maintenance department. Additionally, we proposed a model to improve the accuracy of the prediction. Since the machine learning method utilizes more information than the time series method, it is expected to improve the accuracy of spare part future demand forecasts.

Gated Multi-channel Network Embedding for Large-scale Mobile App Clustering,2023,"['Mobile App Clustering', 'Network Embedding', 'Nodes Clustering', 'Deep Learning']",,"This paper studies the task of embedding nodes with multiple graphs representing multiple information channels, which is useful in a large volume of network clustering tasks. By learning a node using multiple graphs, various characteristics of the node can be represented and embedded stably. Existing studies using multi-channel networks have been conducted by integrating heterogeneous graphs or limiting common nodes appearing in multiple graphs to have similar embeddings. Although these methods effectively represent nodes, it also has limitations by assuming that all networks provide the same amount of information. This paper proposes a method to overcome these limitations; The proposed method gives different weights according to the source graph when embedding nodes; the characteristics of the graph with more important information can be reflected more in the node. To this end, a novel method incorporating a multi-channel gate layer is proposed to weigh more important channels and ignore unnecessary data to embed a node with multiple graphs. Empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-channel-based embedding methods."

Instead of the true reference positions, inertial measurement unit (IMU) data are used to generate pseudo locations, which enable a trainer to move during data collection. This improves the efficiency of data collection dramatically. From an experiment it is seen that the proposed algorithm successfully learns the unsupervised Wi-Fi RSSI positioning model, resulting in 2 m accuracy when the cumulative distribution function (CDF) is 0.8."

Beyond the level where conventional artificial intelligence was merely a means of assisting human decision-making or action, it has reached a stage where it analyzes vast amounts of data to identify problems on its own, create optimal answers, and even self-examine errors. A representative example is the Chat GPT service. Recently, however, copyright infringement disputes have been reported in this regard. For example, in January 2023, Getty Images filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Stability AI, the developer of 'Stable Diffusion', and in April 2023, Twitter CEO Elon Musk also announced its intention to file a copyright infringement lawsuit against Microsoft (MS). In this regard, in this paper, first, as an issue derived from data use, chat GPT does not disclose how to learn data, so it is difficult to confirm whether scrolling and scraping are prohibited information has been collected, and chat GPT service is fair. It was pointed out that there are elements that are difficult to see as use, that the scope of TDM exemption is different for each country, and that TDM exemption regulations have not yet been introduced in Korea. Then, as a way to determine and protect copyright infringement of chat GPT products, first, in relation to authors and rights attribution, the contribution of artificial intelligence and humans to creation is divided and marked by stages (by year), and rights attribution must be different accordingly, second, in relation to the judgment of substantial similarity, refer to the criteria for functional works, but in the case of artificial intelligence products, there is a limit to determining whether or not copyright infringement is caused only by human feelings, so plagiarism verification or copyright infringement prevention programs must be developed and applied. Third, In relation to copyright protection institutions, it is appropriate to stipulate the protection period of artificial intelligence products at 5 years, but a two-dimensional approach must be taken so as not to reduce the incentive for human creation. Fourth, in relation to civil and criminal legal responsibilities, the Product Liability Act Referring to the provisions of the Senate Civil Act, it was proposed that artificial intelligence developers and users jointly and jointly take responsibility in principle, but that responsibilities should be assigned differentially depending on whether there was a violation of the duty of care or negligence. Based on the contents examined in this paper, it is necessary to actively seek rational and systematic ways to regulate generative artificial intelligence services."

This study proposes a method for increasing safety levels in container terminals through the application of object detection with state-of-the-art EfficientDet model support. A distance estimation method is employed to accurately measure the distance to objects and provide proximity alerts when predefined safety thresholds are exceeded. 3D Mapping technology is utilized to create a detailed representation of the container terminal in a virtual environment. This enables a comprehensive visualization of the surroundings, including structures, equipment, and objects. By combining object detection and distance estimation results with the 3D map, potential safety issues can be identified with greater precision. A realistic container terminal scenario was used to evaluate the robustness of the proposed method."

Depth tracking of occluded ships based on SIFT feature matching,2023,"['Multi-target tracking', 'DeepSORT', 'SIFT', 'Feature Points', 'Deep Learning']",,"Multi-target tracking based on the detector is a very hot and important research topic in target tracking. It mainly includes two closely related processes, namely target detection and target tracking. Where target detection is responsible for detecting the exact position of the target, while target tracking monitors the temporal and spatial changes of the target. With the improvement of the detector, the tracking performance has reached a new level. The problem that always exists in the research of target tracking is the problem that occurs again after the target is occluded during tracking. Based on this question, this paper proposes a DeepSORT model based on SIFT features to improve ship tracking. Unlike previous feature extraction networks, SIFT algorithm does not require the characteristics of pre-training learning objectives and can be used in ship tracking quickly. At the same time, we improve and test the matching method of our model to find a balance between tracking accuracy and tracking speed. Experiments show that the model can get more ideal results."

Gradually recognized as “Customer logistics,” the last-mile market is now considered an essential part of the urban service, leading to the recent implementation of the Last-mile Logistics Service Act. Despite the increasing interest and significance, there are not much thorough researches and studies yet done in this customer logistics field. This research aims to address this gap by designing a predictive model based on real parcel delivery data. By comparing and analyzing the model against actual data, the study classifies 229 administrative regions (municipalities) in Korea into four distinct types. Through this approach, the research provides a framework for analyzing under-served areas in the customer logistics that takes into account various social factors (economy, population, etc.), beyond the traditional papers which focused on geographical factors such as remote areas. The analysis of the predictive model reveals that around 50% of metropolitan cities exhibit lower levels of customer logistics compared to the predicted quantities. Even in highly developed cities like Seoul, there is a likeliness of being an under-served area in approximately 20% of 25 districts. Furthermore, 77% of regions, previously classified as delivery service vulnerable areas (rural areas), are identified as under-served areas. Additionally, it is observed that the actual volume of deliveries in remote areas, particularly in rural and mountainous regions, is insufficient. Thus, resolving the unequal distribution of logistics services between regions requires a comprehensive consideration of multiple factors."

ToI objects that are tracked using AMRs are specified in advance or through the robot's settings. It is difficult for an object to be directly set as a ToI object. By making an AMR follow a ToI object wearing a specific vest, the object can be set easily. As such, it is essential to develop a ToI object tracking system that can follow a ToI object wearing a specific vest with AMR. This paper proposes a ToI object tracking system using a specific vest to track changeable ToI objects. The proposed system comprises a recognition unit to recognize a ToI object wearing a specific vest and a control unit to control the AMR. The recognition unit tracks the ToI object and estimates its position while the control unit controls the AMR based on the ToI object’s position. The contributions of this paper are as follows. 1) A system that can follow a changeable ToI object is proposed. 2) This tracking system can easily designate and change ToI objects. In the experiment, the proposed system enabled the AMR to track a changeable ToI object. The recognition unit then calculated the position of the ToI object wearing a specific vest, and the control unit calculated a control signal for the AMR to track the ToI object based on its position."

Different from the existing jamming utilization techniques that harvest energy from the jamming signal as a power supply, our proposed method can take the jamming signal as a favorable factor for frequency detection. Specifically, we design an intelligent differential frequency hopping communication framework (IDFH), which contains two stages of training and communication. We first adopt supervised learning to get the jamming rule during the training stage when the synchronizing sequence is sent. And then, we utilize the jamming rule to improve the frequency detection during the communication stage when the real payload is sent. Simulation results show that the proposed method successfully combated high-speed reactive jamming with different parameters. And the communication performance increases as the power of the jamming signal increase, hence the jamming signal can help users communicate in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environment."

Lightweight block ciphers that can provide efficient performance and security by having a relatively simpler structure and smaller key and block sizes are drawing attention.

One of the new cryptanalytic attacks that have been attracting interest is Neural cryptanalysis, which is a cryptanalytic technique based on neural networks.

The first work that showed good results was carried out by Aron Gohr in CRYPTO'19, the attack was conducted on the lightweight block cipher SPECK-/32/64 and showed better results than conventional differential cryptanalysis. In this paper, we first apply the Differential Neural Distinguisher proposed by Aron Gohr to the block ciphers HIGHT and GOST to test the applicability of the attack to ciphers with different structures. The performance of the Differential Neural Distinguisher is then analyzed by replacing the neural network attack model with five different models (Multi-Layer Perceptron, AlexNet, ResNext, SE-ResNet, SE-ResNext). We then propose a Related-key Neural Distinguisher and apply it to the SPECK-/32/64, HIGHT, and GOST block ciphers.

Color-Image Guided Depth Map Super-Resolution Based on Iterative Depth Feature Enhancement,2023,"['Convolution neural network', 'depth map super-resolution', 'high-low frequency decomposition', 'joint image filtering']",,"With the rapid development of deep learning, Depth Map Super-Resolution (DMSR) method has achieved more advanced performances. However, when the upsampling rate is very large, it is difficult to capture the structural consistency between color features and depth features by these DMSR methods. Therefore, we propose a color-image guided DMSR method based on iterative depth feature enhancement. Considering the feature difference between high-quality color features and low-quality depth features, we propose to decompose the depth features into High-Frequency (HF) and Low-Frequency (LF) components. Due to structural homogeneity of depth HF components and HF color features, only HF color features are used to enhance the depth HF features without using the LF color features. Before the HF and LF depth feature decomposition, the LF component of the previous depth decomposition and the updated HF component are combined together. After decomposing and reorganizing recursively-updated features, we combine all the depth LF features with the final updated depth HF features to obtain the enhanced-depth features. Next, the enhanced-depth features are input into the multi-stage depth map fusion reconstruction block, in which the cross enhancement module is introduced into the reconstruction block to fully mine the spatial correlation of depth map by interleaving various features between different convolution groups. Experimental results can show that the two objective assessments of root mean square error and mean absolute deviation of the proposed method are superior to those of many latest DMSR methods."

Appearance-based gaze estimation with feature fusion of multi-level information elements,2023,"['gaze estimation', 'feature extraction', 'feature fusion', 'deep learning', 'artificial intelligence']",,"Gaze estimation is a fundamental task in many applications of cognitive sciences, human–computer interaction, and robotics. The purely data-driven appearance-based gaze estimation methods may suffer from a lack of interpretability, which prevents their applicability to pervasive scenarios. In this study, a feature fusion method with multi-level information elements is proposed to improve the comprehensive performance of the appearance-based gaze estimation model. The multi-level feature extraction and expression are carried out from the originally captured images, and a multi-level information element matrix is established. A gaze conduction principle is formulated for reasonably fusing information elements from the established matrix. According to the gaze conduction principle along with the matrix, a multi-level information element fusion (MIEF) model for gaze estimation is proposed. Then, several input modes and network structures of the MIEF model are designed, and a series of grouping experiments are carried out on a small-scale sub-dataset. Furthermore, the optimized input modes and network structures of the MIEF model are selected for training and testing on the whole dataset to verify and compare model performance. Experimental results show that optimizing the feature combination in the input control module and fine-tuning the computational architecture in the feature extraction module can improve the performance of the gaze estimation model, which would enable the reduction of the model by incorporating the critical features and thus improve the performance and accessibility of the method. Compared with the reference baseline, the optimized model based on the proposed feature fusion method of multi-level information elements can achieve efficient training and improve the test accuracy in the verification experiment. The average error is 1.63 cm on phones on the GazeCapture dataset, which achieves comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods."

To tackle the inherent challenges arising from such cameras, we selected smartphone frames as a case study. We present a customized jig and data collection strategies to deal with the low-resolution and limited dynamic range issues inherent in low-cost cameras. Additionally, we perceive smartphone part inspection as a pseudo anomaly detection problem since acquiring non-attached parts samples or physically separating parts from already attached samples might not be feasible.

In order to process four or more images simultaneously without difficulty, the images were downsized horizontally and vertically by 1/2, then multiplexed to create one image, and the skeleton was inferred using the Yolov8-pose model. During the experiment, the result was about 1/4 of the total time required for inference for 4 images, and skeletal inference performance was also confirmed to have similar performance to single image inference.

A Low-power DRAM Controller ASIC with a 36% Reduction in Average Active Power by Increasing On-die Termination Resistance,2023,"['DRAM controller', 'ASIC', 'low power', 'termination', 'signal integrity']",,"A low-power DRAM controller ASIC is proposed for point-to-point interconnects such as deep learning applications. The termination resistance of the DRAM controller is increased to 160 Ω and infinity during the write and read modes, respectively, to reduce power consumption with no transmission errors. Short-reach interconnects of 25 mm DQ/DQS lines are used to avoid signal integrity issues. The proposed DRAM controller is implemented in a 65 nm process with an active area of 1.64 mm2, 16 DQ 8 Gb configuration, and a data rate of 800 Mbps per DQ pin. The DRAM interface using the proposed controller and a commercial DDR3 DRAM chip consumes 379 mW on average; this is 64% of the power with the default termination of the JEDEC standard. Derived equations for the TX and RX current of the DRAM interface reveals that the TX current of a clock signal is minimized when the time of flight of the PCB channel is integer multiples of the half period of the clock signal with large TX and RX terminations."

Generally, the joint force and moment are calculated though inverse dynamics using segment kinematic data, ground reaction force, and moment. However, this approach has problems such as estimation error of kinematic data and soft tissue artifacts, which can lead to inaccuracy of joint forces and moments in inverse dynamics. This study aimed to apply a recurrent neural network (RNN) instead of inverse dynamics to joint force and moment estimation. The proposed RNN could receive signals from inertial sensors and force plate as input vector and output lower extremity joints forces and moments.

Considering Read and Write Characteristics of Page Access Separately for Efficient Memory Management,2023,"['Memory management', 'paging system', 'read', 'write', 'memory reference', 'CLOCK.']",,"With the recent proliferation of memory-intensive workloads such as deep learning, analyzing memory access characteristics for efficient memory management is becoming increasingly important. Since read and write operations in memory access have different characteristics, an efficient memory management policy should take into account the characteristics of these two operations separately. Although some previous studies have considered the different characteristics of reads and writes, they require a modified hardware architecture supporting read bits and write bits. Unlike previous approaches, we propose a software-based management policy under the existing memory architecture for considering read/write characteristics. The proposed policy logically partitions memory space into the read/write area and the write area by making use of reference bits and dirty bits provided in modern paging systems. Simulation experiments with memory access traces show that our approach performs better than the CLOCK algorithm by 23% on average, and the effect is similar to the previous policy with hardware support."

A Study on a Method for Generating a 3D Head Model from a Single 2D Face Image Using Open Source,2023,"['3D Avatar', '3D Face Shape', '3D Head Model', 'Deep Learning', 'Metabus', 'Open Source']",,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, society's interest in the metaverse has recently increased rapidly. By using avatars, which are virtual objects that represent users within the metaverse, people enjoy a higher degree of freedom in the virtual world and various interactions with other people become possible. In most metaverse platforms, the user selects one from a limited number of pre-made avatar templates. Afterwards, the user must individually select the avatar's hair style, eyes, nose, and mouth shape from among those presented within the metaverse platform. Creating an avatar that resembles the user is not an easy task because the presented options for facial features and hairstyles are limited. In this paper, we present a method to automatically generate a 3D head model from a user's 2D face image and implement a prototype system. We show that a 3D head model creation system can be built at low cost and in a short time by utilizing open source at each stage of model creation. In this study, the process of applying facial texture to the 3D face shape was omitted and focused on 3D modelling work."

Therefore, this study proposes a methodology that can detect the edit points of video according to whether person in video are spoken by using Video Swin Transformer. First, facial keypoints are detected through face alignment. To this end, the proposed structure first detects facial keypoints through face alignment. Through this process, the temporal and spatial changes of the face are reflected from the input video data. And, through the Video Swin Transformer-based model proposed in this study, the behavior of the person in the video is classified. Specifically, after combining the feature map generated through Video Swin Transformer from video data and the facial keypoints detected through Face Alignment, utterance is classified through convolution layers.

As a result, the supplement of solar power facility is increasing all over the world. However, solar power is easily affected by the environment such as geography and weather, so accurate solar power forecast is important for stable operation and efficient management. However, it is very hard to predict the exact amount of solar power using statistical methods. In addition, the conventional prediction methods have focused on only short- or long-term prediction, which causes it to take a long time to obtain various prediction models with different prediction horizons. Therefore, this study utilizes a many-to-many structure of a recurrent neural network (RNN) to integrate short-term and long-term predictions of solar power generation.

At the same time, he is a poet representing his era and region. The remarkable thing about his poetic world is that its literary achievements reached that of his prose. Until now, the research on his poetry were mainly based on the characterization of his scholarly perspectives and expressions about his feelings after reading. This study aims to clarify the parts that were unacknowledged by previous studies.The poetic world of Hong Yeoha is comprised of the origins regarding the traditions of familial studies and influences from pedagogical relationships, maternal family, and writers from China and Joseon. In specific, the literary abilities of the Hong family that started with Hong Guidal(1438~1504) was redefined by Hong Yeoha. The poetry of Hong Yeoha was directed influenced by his father Hong Ho(1586~1646). By editing and organizing Hong Ho’s collection Mu-ju-il-go (無住逸稿), Hong Yeoha absorbed his family’s literary traditions. Cho Gyeong(1586~1669) and Lee Sik (1584~1647) are two teachers that Hong Yeoha looked up to and were influenced by. Hong Yeoha regarded highly of the works of his maternal grandfather, Koh Gyeongmyeong (1533~1592), and frequently read his collection Je-bong-jip (霽峯集).The poetric world of Hong Yeoha can be characterized by the tendency to be long and the various emotions of the casual style. In order to elaborate on his deep internal emotions, Hong Yeoha preferred the style of a long poem. In particular, he preferred to write his poems in an eight-pattern structure. Such long poems by Hong Yeoha expanded his poetic world.The causal styled-poems by Hong Yeoha enriched his poetic world by sincerely revealing his true human form. Of the poems, several works written in the feminine voice raises the doubts as to whether such strict Confucian scholar like Hong Yeoha can have such pure emotions. Furthermore, these works that candidly reveal a pure human being unattached to etiquette and manners portray the truthful poetic world of Hong Yeoha."

Literary acceptance for students is in contact with the concept of spatiality in literary education. Furthermore, through observation and reflection on literary phenomena, awareness as a contextual existence can be promoted in classical literature education. Thus, an ecological methodology of classical literature education can help to realize literary education. The emphasis on community competence, the continuation of existing ecological literature, decentralization, and postmodernity in the literary education scene could be considered.Classical literature education centered on regionality can constitute a methodology to realize literary education from an ecological perspective. Classical literature education centered on locality is reproduced through memory and culture, and it creates a conversational context through the reproduced landscape as students read the respective works. In this context, the learner acquires a sense of spatial identity as a spatially contextualized existence through works of classical literature.Learners also gain the sense of being a member of the community by reminiscing about cultural subjects who created cultural traces reflected in literary works.By emphasizing the locality of learners, the ecological approach to classical literature education guides the selection of materials and leads to a decentralized understanding of the works. The list of sanctions of the classical literature class is described within the boundaries of the region the learner inhabits. As the understanding of the work is achieved in the context of the learner’s life, the literary act performed by the learner is decentralized. Escaping from a normative interpretation and accepting the contextual acceptance of the work’s interpretation can liberate students from and the need for a unified, uniform understanding of the work."

Data were collected from 63 participants. Each participant’s social psychological traits (i.e., social comparison orientation, public self-consciousness, narcissism, self-esteem, and social anxiety) were measured using a survey questionnaire. In addition, the photos that the participants had uploaded on Instagram during the past three months from the start of data collection were also collected. We used Google Vision API to analyze the characteristics of the photos, which included the brightness and saturation of photos, ratio of portrait photos, that of portrait photos that contained joyful faces, and ratio of solo photos. A set of regression analyses revealed that 1) individuals with high social comparison orientation tended to upload less saturated photos and more portrait photos, 2) users with high social anxiety were less likely to upload solo photos, 3) people with high public self-consciousness likely uploaded more solo photos and more bright photos, and 4) people with high self-esteem tended to upload more joyful photos. These results imply that the characteristics of photos uploaded on social media platforms are likely to reflect user’s social psychological traits.

To find an answer to this, this study conducted a panel model analysis using time-series data of 900 domestic SMEs during the period from 2011 to 2021, focusing on a research model consisting of ESG items and variables representing a series of financial attributes. As a result of the empirical analysis, the findings are as follows: 1) The ESG total score was confirmed to have no statistically significant relationship with ROA and ROE, which are financial performances, while it had a statistically significant positive (+) relationship with Tobin’s Q, which is market performance. 2) By sector, business activities in the environment (E) sector showed a positive (+) relationship with financial performance, but no significant relationship with market performance. In addition, 3) management activities in the social (S) sector had no impact on financial performance, but had a significant negative (-) relationship with market performance. 4) Management activities in the governance structure (G) sector were found to have a positive (+) effect on performance. 5) Some of the financial attribute variables showed a significant negative (-) relationship with market performance, while many variables showed a positive (+) or negative (-) relationship with financial performance. From this result, it can be seen that ESG management activities generally have a positive effect on financial performance in SMEs, while positive and negative relationships with market performance coexist. Nevertheless, considering a higher level of generalization, it is difficult to conclude that the relationship between ESG management activities and SMEs' financial performance and market performance is positive or negative. This can be said to be a result that disproves that the ESG management activities of domestic SMEs have not yet reached maturity."

However, previous studies related to the fashion business mainly focused on developing AI recommendation systems or studying AI application cases, but there is a limit to understanding the behavioral patterns of fashion consumers. Therefore, it is meaningful to analyze consumers' purchasing intention to use these new technology-based subscription services.This study attempted to identify the main causal variables that affect the intention to use the fashion subscription service. The proposed research model and hypothesis were verified through a Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling based on a survey of 430 consumers. It examined the relationship between these factors affecting the intention to use through perceived value based on the value-based adoption model. This research found that service convenience has a major influence on perceived usefulness in relation to benefits, and recency on perceived enjoyment. On the contrary, it was found that special preferential benefits for privacy concern and recency for subscription costs had the greatest positive and negative effects, respectively. In the case of AI-recommended system-based fashion subscription services, this study also suggested it is important to provide customers with a convenient, easy-to-use system and up-to-date products.

Despite the flexible usage of deep neural network-based models for this task, the existing methods disregard the difficulty of each question and result in poor performance for learners who get the easy question wrong or the hard question correct. In this paper, we propose quantizing the learners’ response information based on the question difficulty so that the knowledge tracing models can learn both the response and the difficulty of the question in order to improve the performance. We design a method that can effectively discriminate between negative samples with a high percentage of correct answer rate and positive samples with a low percentage of correct answer rate.

In this paper, noise in low-illuminance images for which ground truth cannot be obtained is removed using Noise2Noise, and spatial resolution and radial resolution are evaluated using ISO 12233 charts and colorchecker as metrics such as MTF and SNR. It can be shown that the quality of the low-illuminance image, which has been evaluated mainly for qualitative evaluation, can also be evaluated quantitatively."

Additionally, we utilized more coordinate data to confirm movement of facial muscles by region to address limitations of the Nottingham system measurement method. We graded the level of this movement to enable intuitive confirmation and confirmed differences between existing Nottingham system and the H.B grade. This simple system could determine the level of paralysis in patients with Bell’s palsy and their corresponding risk level for related diseases. It enables information on causative disease of patients with Bell’s palsy to be quickly obtained, enabling prompt treatment and support."

Through CNN deep learning and PCA region extraction we obtain face standard data for each animal and store similarity and region vector values in DB. We also leverage two similarity measurements to enable users to accurately provide the desired information. When the user chooses an animal of a character to be implemented in due diligence the recommender system utilizes the existing analyzed DB to provide standardized animal images. This allows users to recommend and cast actors who are most similar to the image of an implemented animal. This work is meaningful in showing that the results of existing studies can be utilized industrially.

To this end, the detection box was estimated from the 2D joint keypoint coordinate estimated from the pose estimation model and OneEuroFilter was used to compensate for the jitter error in the detection box. The center point of the detected box was used to track the left and right movement of the object, and an object tracking algorithm was developed through depth estimation using the size, height, and ratio of the box. In addition, for multiple object tracking, ID matching was performed by examining the similarity of joint key points detected between current and previous frames using the frame in which the object was detected as an ID value."

Deep learning has a problem of not being able to verify whether the designed model has a structure with optimized performance due to the nature of learning as a black box. The neural network structure search model is composed of a recurrent neural network that creates a model and a convolutional neural network that is the generated network. Conventional neural network structure search models use recurrent neural networks, but in this paper, we propose GC-NAS, which uses graph convolutional neural networks instead of recurrent neural networks to create convolutional neural network models. The proposed GC-NAS uses the Layer Extraction Block to explore depth, and the Hyper Parameter Prediction Block to explore spatial and temporal information (hyper parameters) based on depth information in parallel. Therefore, since the depth information is reflected, the search area is wider, and the purpose of the search area of the model is clear by conducting a parallel search with depth information, so it is judged to be superior in theoretical structure compared to GC-NAS. GC-NAS is expected to solve the problem of the high-dimensional time axis and the range of spatial search of recurrent neural networks in the existing neural network structure search model through the graph convolutional neural network block and graph generation algorithm. In addition, we hope that the GC-NAS proposed in this paper will serve as an opportunity for active research on the application of graph convolutional neural networks to neural network structure search."

It is being used across various domains such as security and deep learning, necessitating high-performance hardware specifications centered around graphics processing units.The research methodology employed in this paper can be outlined as follows: the pursuit of optimal parameter values by manipulating the coefficients and constants within the function employed by the convolutional neural network, and fine-tuning the parameter values themselves. The outcome of this endeavor, involving the optimization of coefficients, constants, and parameter values in the convolutional neural network's functions, yields significant insights. For the original sigmoid formula, optimal parameter values are identified: a coefficient of 9 for the first ""x,"" a coefficient of 7 for the second ""x,"" and a constant term of 0.0001. Shifting attention to the modified Sigmoid function, the pursuit of optimal conditions for high accuracy and fast calculation time leads to the determination of specific values. Notably, the coefficient of the first ""x"" (""β"") within the function is established as 30, while the coefficient of the second ""x"" (""δ"") is set at 70. Additionally, the square value of 5 is identified as optimal, further underscoring the importance of achieving a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency."

For this purpose, we limit our-selves to a deep neural network-based generative model that assumes the necessary mathematical properties “one-to-one correspondence” and “locally smoothness”. As a result of experiments using the MNIST dataset, we confirmed that the proposed visualization autoencoder method for a deep neural network model that satisfies these properties can generate samples of interest and visualize the conversion process."

Internet articles related to tax policy are easily accessible to anyone, and opinions can be freely expressed in comments. Therefore, it can be regarded that the comments on the article represent public opinion on the policy. In this study, based on text data collected by surveys through random sampling, we train a transformer model to build a sentiment analyzer that can classify positive/negative opinions on the new income tax policy on cryptocurrency and obtain the positive/negative ratio for the comments. As a result, we find that the rate of negative opinions in the policy responses to the comments on the articles was 80 to 90% of the total comments. It can be seen that this shows a considerable level of bias compared to the negative rate of about 30% of the open-ended survey through random sampling.

The neologism kay- is mainly attached to negative words. However, its combinations with positive words are frequently observed today. In light of this phenomenon, this study probed words where kay- was attached to determine whether there has been a change in its semantic prosody. Specifically, Korean tweets including kay from 2010 to 2019 were scraped, and ten yearly Twitter corpora were constructed based on the scraped tweets. After words with kay- were extracted from each corpus, they were sorted into positive and negative categories using LSTM trained to classify words by sentiment. The token frequencies of every positive word were counted and added up for each year. The same process was repeated for negative words. The analysis of token frequencies from the ten corpora indicated that the use of positive words has gradually increased. The result demonstrates that the semantic prosody of kay- is shifting from negative toward positive. This study showed for the first time how artificial intelligence (AI) could be applied to semantic prosody research and confirmed the possibility of AI as a new method for semantic prosody analysis."

Therefore, using our in-house simulator, we measured and compared the various performance metrics of workloads based on traditional out-of-order and in-order processors with Processing-in-Memory-based systems. As a result, the PIM-based system improves performance compared to other computing models due to the short-term data reuse characteristic of computational kernels from PolyBench. However, some kernels perform poorly in PIM-based systems without a multi-layer cache hierarchy due to some kernel’s long-term data reuse characteristics. Hence, our evaluation and analysis results suggest that further research should consider dynamic and workload pattern adaptive approaches to overcome performance degradation from computational kernels with long-term data reuse characteristics and hidden data locality."

3D Measurement Using a Single Image for Smart Manufacturing of Microscopic Products in a Ceramic Powder Pressing Process,2023,"['Monocular depth estimation', 'Dimension measurement', 'Thickness measurement', 'Dimensional anomaly detection', 'Manufacturing']",,"Owing to the development of artificial intelligence, smart manufacturing has extensively been investigated, which has rapidly increased manufacturing productivity. The most prevalent smart manufacturing application using machine learning is product quality enhancement through surface and dimensional defect detection. Various sensors, such as stereoscopic, 2D, or 3D lasers as well as structured light sensors, have been used to perform precise thickness measurements. These sensors are expensive and they require a large space for installation in a factory, which consumes time and energy. Moreover, micro-scale dimensional measurement equipment is much more expensive and easily damaged by environmental changes such as temperature and humidity. In the beginning, we introduce a single image-based 3D measurement system using depth estimation that makes dimensional anomaly detection easy and fast. This is important for green technology because the proposed method can reduce condemned or inferior goods by detecting anomalies early and save raw materials and energy consumption. The existing method is deep learning based depth estimation. However, it is difficult for conventional depth estimation methods to predict 3D measurement directly because of the difference between depth estimation and 3D measurement. That is because inputs are discontinuous dimensional values with homogeneous textures. Conventional depth estimation is a regression task that assumes inputs are continuous. To circumvent this problem, we propose a magnifier loss. In addition, to overcome the object’s homogeneity and meet the micro-scale dimensional precision requirement, this paper proposes a novel magnifier transformation function that magnifies the homogeneous textures and micro-scale dimensional value changes. This method achieves better quantitative performance than a conventional computer vision method, stereo-matching approaches, and even a structured light sensor, which is known to be one of most accurate and expensive sensors for a 3D measurement system."

Using a Novel CNN Model for Predicting the Induction Heating Lines to Obtain a Desired Deformed Shape of Steel Plate,2023,"['Induction heating', 'Line heating', 'Triangle heating', 'R-CNN', 'Rotated region of interest (RROI)']",,"Induction heating is a fast and energy-efficient method of heating steel plates in the shipyard industry due to the increasing demand for steel plate deformation. In this study, deep learning models are proposed with abstract representations of heatmap images allowing efficient recognition of complex and nonlinear patterns. The model for determining the heating type for the plastic zone is a fairly simple and effective approach to perform the heating type determination with the choice of weight optimization of network. A novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained to predict heating regions from heatmap images with different vertical displacements of the required steel plate. We have proposed a Region based CNN (R-CNN) model using a sparse group to classify heating lines based on heatmap images of desired complex shape as input. The rotated region of interest pool layers and the rotated bounding box regression are also suggested to recognize inclined slender shapes of heating lines. The R-CNN is trained to detect heating regions bounded by labelled boxes within the confines of the steel plate. A frame-based event predictor for deformation areas is trained independently to analyse each individual box in the regions proposed. Then a post-processing step is based on the output of the R-CNN to determine the actual heating zones. By evaluating through the data sets, we have experimentally found that the proposed algorithm has performed well and achieved better results than other conventional methods."
Refinement of Ground Truth Data for X-ray Coronary Artery Angiography (CAG) using Active Contour Model,2023,"['Ground Truth Improvement', 'Coronary Artery Angiography', 'U-Net']",,"We present a novel method aimed at refining ground truth data through regularization and modification, particularly applicable when working with the original ground truth set.

In many machine learning tasks requiring pixel-level segmentation sets, accurately delineating objects is vital. However, it proves challenging for thin and elongated objects such as blood vessels in X-ray coronary angiography, often resulting in inconsistent generation of ground truth data. This method involves an analysis of the quality of training set pairs - comprising images and ground truth data - to automatically regulate and modify the boundaries of ground truth segmentation. Employing the active contour model and a recursive ground truth generation approach results in stable and precisely defined boundary contours. Following the regularization and adjustment of the ground truth set, there is a substantial improvement in the performance of deep neural networks."

Among these efforts, Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture is noteworthy for predicting default in situations with limited data on thin filers.

Although vision transformer deep learning models have outperformed conventional convolutional neural network (CNN) models in computer vision, they require more computations and parameters than CNN models. Thus, they are not directly applicable to embedded edge devices with limited hardware resources. Many researchers have proposed various model compression methods or lightweight architectures for vision transformers; however, there are only a few studies evaluating the effects of model compression techniques of vision transformers on performance. Regarding this problem, this paper presents a performance evaluation of vision transformers on embedded platforms. We investigated the behaviors of three vision transformers: DeiT, LeViT, and MobileViT. Each model performance was evaluated by accuracy and inference time on edge devices using the ImageNet dataset. We assessed the effects of the quantization method applied to the models on latency enhancement and accuracy degradation by profiling the proportion of response time occupied by major operations. In addition, we evaluated the performance of each model on GPU and EdgeTPU-based edge devices. In our experimental results, LeViT showed the best performance in CPU-based edge devices, and DeiT-small showed the highest performance improvement in GPU-based edge devices. In addition, only MobileViT models showed performance improvement on EdgeTPU. Summarizing the analysis results through profiling,  the degree of performance improvement of each vision transformer model was highly dependent on the proportion of parts that could be optimized in the target edge device. In summary, to apply vision transformers to on-device AI solutions, either proper operation composition and optimizations specific to target edge devices must be considered."

Moreover, the availability of the dataset for multi-class change detection has been constrained. To address these limitations, this study proposes a multi-class semantic segmentation methodology by adapting existing datasets to suit the characteristics of the CAS500-1. Specifically, aerial imagery datasets tailored to domestic regions are parsed and transformed to align with satellite imagery. Additionally, overseas datasets are augmented to overcome the limitations of side-looking observations in satellite imagery. Experimental results for multi-class change detection involving buildingconstruction and demolition indicate an IoU (Intersection over Union) of around 87% for the new construction label and approximately 58% for the demolition label. These results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed multi-class semantic segmentation approach. While certain instances of false positives occurred in regions with rapid changes in illumination, it is anticipated that such limitations can be overcome by augmenting the dataset with additional unchanged data in the future."

Therefore, this study aims to explore the possibilities and limitations of using ChatGPT, a type of deep learning artificial intelligence chatbot that is becoming an issue these days, as a tool in the product design process, and to think about the role of future product designers.Methods : In order to explore the possibility of using ChatGPT as a tool in the data collection and analysis stage during the product design process, four designers are divided into two groups to conduct empirical research. Group A selects five data collection analysis topics, and Group B uses ChatGPT to collect and analyze data, compares and shares the derived data collection results, and conducts participant FGI to evaluate the characteristics of ChatGPT.Results : Based on the results of empirical studies, it can be seen that the biggest advantage of ChatGPT is productivity, and it is expected to function as a tool that can reduce the time of the data collection and analysis stage and increase accuracy in the future design process. However, when limiting areas such as accurate numerical results or restrictions on certain areas are set, the results derived did not meet expectations, and the source of information is unclear, so it is difficult to trust the results of ChatGPT 100% and the effectiveness, economy, and development are highly evaluated, but creativity, diversity, and convenience need to be supplemented. And it was derived as a disadvantage that these deficiencies must go through the hands of designers again.Conclusion : In the midst of increasing artificial intelligence, this study was conducted not to be afraid of changes in our lives and lifestyles that will be changed by artificial intelligence, but to actively utilize artificial intelligence. This empirical study confirmed that if ChatGPT is operated well as a tool, productivity can be maximized in one area of the design process, but it is still clear that the original function of these artificial intelligence design tools is important, but the ability of designers to operate is also very important. Based on this study, it is expected that artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT will be used without fear and further grow into designers with the skills required by the artificial intelligence design era."

Dynamics-Based Location Prediction and Neural Network Fine-Tuning for Task Offloading in Vehicular Networks,2023,"['Internet of Vehicles', 'task offloading', 'neural network', 'fine-tuning', 'parameter optimization.']",,"Task offloading in vehicular networks is hot topic in the development of autonomous driving. In these scenarios, due to the role of vehicles and pedestrians, task characteristics are changing constantly. The classical deep learning algorithm always uses a pre-trained neural network to optimize task offloading, which leads to system performance degradation. Therefore, this paper proposes a neural network fine-tuning task offloading algorithm, combining with location prediction for pedestrians and vehicles by the Payne model of fluid dynamics and the car-following model, respectively. After the locations are predicted, characteristics of tasks can be obtained and the neural network will be fine-tuned. Finally, the proposed algorithm continuously predicts task characteristics and fine-tunes a neural network to maintain high system performance and meet low delay requirements. From the simulation results, compared with other algorithms, the proposed algorithm still guarantees a lower task offloading delay, especially when congestion occurs."

It aimed to present implications for the past tense and similar language phenomena in current deep learning models, such as ChatGPT, a modern large language model(LLM). The discussion related to the past tense in English dates back to when a special article called ""The Past-Tense Debate"" was published in Trends in Cognitive Sciences in 2002. As a result, seemingly simple language phenomena gained the interest of researchers in various fields such as linguistics, psychology, and computer science. Steven Pinker and Michael Ullman wrote a paper titled ""The past and future of the past tense,"" to which James McClelland and Karalyn Patterson responded with a paper stating, ""Words or Rules cannot exploit the regularity in exceptions."" McClelland and Patterson published a paper titled ""Rules or connections in past-tense inflections: what does the evidence rule out?"" and Pinker and Ullman countered with ""Combination and structure, not gradedness, is the issue."" At this point, twenty years later, in 2023, ChatGPT, a neural network-based AI system, has attracted global attention. In this paper, we examine past tense theories and explore whether recent neural networks like ChatGPT resolve the past tense debate or if the issues raised in that debate are still relevant in the current era of artificial intelligence."
Short-Term Load Forecasting for Commercial Building Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network with Similar Day Selection Model,2023,"['Short-term load forecasting', 'The hybrid CNN-LSTM network', 'Similar day selection model']",,"Load forecasting is essential in power systems for reliable and efficient energy planning and operation. Commercial buildings usually account for 20% of all energy used, with approximately 30% being wasted. Accurate load forecasting for commercial buildings can help improve operational efficiency. For accurate forecasting load, deep learning models have been used. Furthermore, the selection of input data has become important because the forecasting results can vary depending on which input data is trained. However, although various hybrid models have used historical sequential data as input data using the sliding window approach, they did not consider the hourly correlation between factors and load while selecting input data. In this paper, a hybrid convolutional neural network—long short-term memory network is used in combination with a similar day selection model to overcome these limitations by selecting the data of similar days as input data and by considering the hourly correlation with factors. The proposed method is found to be effective by comparing the performance of the traditional methods using convolutional neural or long short-term memory network."

In order to calculate diagnostic indicators of heart disease and spinal disease such as VHS(vertebral heart scale) and Cobb angle, it is necessary to accurately segment the thoracic spine, carina, and heart in a chest X-ray image. A deep neural network model in which the high-resolution representation of the image for each layer and the structure converted into a low-resolution feature map are connected in parallel was adopted. This structure enables the relative position information in the image to be effectively reflected in the segmentation process. It is shown that learning performance can be improved by combining the OCR module, in which pixel information and object information are mutually interacted in a multi-step process, and the channel attention module, which allows each channel of the network to be reflected as different weight values. In addition, a method of augmenting learning data is presented in order to provide robust performance against changes in the position, shape, and size of the subject in the X-ray image. The effectiveness of the proposed theory was evaluated through an experiment using 145 human chest X-ray images and 118 animal X-ray images."
Localization of lung abnormalities on chest X-rays using self-supervised equivariant attention,2023,"['Self-supervised equivariant attention', 'ResNet50', 'Siamese network', 'Weak supervision', 'Pixel correlation module', 'Self-attention', 'CAM']",,"Chest X-Ray (CXR) images provide most anatomical details and the abnormalities on a 2D plane. Therefore, a 2D view of the 3D anatomy is sometimes sufficient for the initial diagnosis. However, close to fourteen commonly occurring diseases are sometimes difficult to identify by visually inspecting the images. Therefore, there is a drift toward developing computer-aided assistive systems to help radiologists. This paper proposes a deep learning model for the classification and localization of chest diseases by using image-level annotations. The model consists of a modified Resnet50 backbone for extracting feature corpus from the images, a classifier, and a pixel correlation module (PCM). During PCM training, the network is a weight-shared siamese architecture where the first branch applies the affine transform to the image before feeding to the network, while the second applies the same transform to the network output. The method was evaluated on CXR from the clinical center in the ratio of 70:20 for training and testing. The model was developed and tested using the cloud computing platform Google Colaboratory (NVidia Tesla P100 GPU, 16 GB of RAM). A radiologist subjectively validated the results.

This paper aims to develop a simulation method that applies a deep learning technique to rapidly and accurately estimate the adsorption performance of bio-adsorbents when inserted into liquid radioactive waste.Materials and Methods: A model that describes various interactions between a bio-adsorbent and liquid has been constructed using numerical methods to estimate the adsorption capacity of the bio-adsorbent. To generate datasets for machine learning, Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) simulations were conducted while considering radioactive concentrations in the adsorbent column.Results and Discussion: Compared with the result of the conventional method, the proposed method indicates that the accuracy is in good agreement, within 0.99% and 0.06% for the R2 score and mean absolute percentage error, respectively. Furthermore, the estimation speed is improved by over 30 times.Conclusion: Note that an artificial neural network can rapidly and accurately estimate the survival rate of a bio-adsorbent from radiation ionization compared with the MCNP simulation and can determine if the bio-adsorbents are reusable."

Various techniques are used to improve the accuracy of product recommendation in existing e-commerce. Among them, there are chronic problems that use RNN, a multi classification-based product recommendation model. RNN is a deep learning model suitable for time series classification tasks, but it suffers from issues such as gradient vanishing and gradient exploding. To Compensate for these issues, CNN models are often used to effectively detect local patterns through kernels. In this study, we compare the performance of recommendation models based on an architecture that generates product recommendation models by training CNN models with time series data through three different imaging encodings: GAF, MTF and RP. In our experiments, we split the 540,000 published transaction dataset into train and test. The splitted data is constructed as time series data and zero-padded to equalize the size of the model’s input image. We train AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet50, and MobileNet models on images generated by the three imaging algorithms and compare their product recommendation accuracy with the performance of existing RNN recommendation models. We can see that the CNN models perform better than the LSTM. When imaged with the GAF algorithm and trained on the MobileNet model, the highest recommendation accuracy was achieved, and the learning time was also shortened, improving efficiency. Future research will include the advancement of imaging algorithms to improve the performance of product recommendation models and the development of CNN models optimized for time series image data."

We explored bidirectional encoder representationsfrom transformers (BERT)-based deep learning models utilizing hyperparameter tuning, data sampling, andlogits ensembles with a label distribution. We evaluated our model in Kaggle competitions for gender bias,general bias, and hate speech detection. For gender bias detection, an F1-score of 0.7711 was achieved usingan ensemble of the Soongsil-BERT and KcELECTRA models. The general bias task included the gender biastask, and the ensemble model achieved the best F1-score of 0.7166."

The development of artificial intelligence in various fields, such as life, research, and sports, is largely due to the increase of user data, the improvement of the performance of computing devices, and the proposal of deep learning methodology.The publication of SIA's ""The Reason for Writing Poetry"" in 2022 was a practical answer to the possibility of AI-created poetry, which was previously considered impossible (or would take a very long time). Of course, SIA's creations were not completely free from criticism of previous AI creations, but it was confirmed that many aspects were improved by the excellent performance of the underlying super-large language model KoGPT and a huge amount of pre-training data of over 12,000 pieces.From the perspective of ""AI that writes poetry"", which is developed in this way, this paper tries to train conversational AI(Chat GPT). In the case of conversational AI provided by websites such as Bard or Chat GPT, unlike GPT-3 on which SIA is based, or previous models such as GPT-2, and distinguished models such as BERT, pre-trained models are not publicly available, so training by modeling is not possible. However, it has the advantage of being highly accessible and versatile. It is also excellent at reading and maintaining the context of the prompt entered in the same session.Through the process of attempting to train “AI Yi Yuk-sa” through Chat GPT (GPT-4), this paper explores the possibility of “AI-based poetic dialog” in conversational language models. Furthermore, it suggests the possibility and expected effects of using it in literature/creative education, and setting the direction of sophisticated poetry creation of AI Yi Yuk-sa in the future."

To solve such problems, this paper proposes heat-transport pipeline diagnosis methods using deep learning models. We propose models that are trained with thermal and RGB image data and signal sensor data. Our experiment results showed 99% accuracy when trained on signal sensor data, 96% accuracy for thermal image data, and 97.5% accuracy for multimodal models, which used both image and signal datasets.

Eventually, the Np-C4-Np is synthesized rapidly with higher space–time yield compared to thebatch system, thus confirming benefits in terms of productivity. Moreover, we prevent the deteriorationof electronic circuits during the semiconductor packaging process by lowering the molding temperature(126 C) of EMC and quickly dissipating the heat generated from semiconductor chip by increasing thethermal conductivity (0.34 W  m1  K1) of EMC."

It is designed to solve the problem that the diversity of samples generated by the original SMOTE model is limited, as well as the deep learning model is limited by the size of training samples and processing speed. Firstly, a few bearing fault data are clustered by G to achieve cluster division. Secondly, according to the cluster density distribution function designed in this paper, the weights of different clusters and sample weights to achieve intra-class balance are determined and data quality is improved. Then, to take full advantage of the limited fault data, based on the sensitivity of the support vector machine (SVM) to imbalanced data, the enhanced boundary is established between generated data and the SVM classifier under different penalty factor (PF) values. According to the accuracy, the optimal PF is determined, and fault datasets satisfying diversity are obtained. To improve the classification accuracy, a convolutional neural network with an attention mechanism is built. Finally, analysis using two practical cases shows the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Partial least squares regression (PLSR) and support vector regression (SVR) were used as machine learning methodologies. However, a deep learning based model called as one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) were also developed for models comparison. With a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.999 and a lowest RMSEP (root mean squared error of prediction) of 0.006% for the prediction datasets, the SVR model created for FT-IR spectral data outperformed both the PLSR and 1 D CNN models. On the other hand, for the classification of essential oils derived from plants collected from various geographical regions, the created SVM (support vector machine) classification model for Raman spectroscopic data obtained an overall classification accuracy of 0.997% which was superior than the FT-IR (0.986%) data. Based on the results we propose that FT-IR spectroscopy, when coupled with the SVR model, has a significant potential for the non-destructive identification of terpenoids in essential oils compared with destructive chemical analysis methods."

Nevertheless, the process of selecting an appropriate font can be burdensome for users as it necessitates examining all available fonts. Furthermore, users with limited font usage experience might inadvertently choose an inappropriate font. To tackle this concern, we developed a system that recommends fonts by evaluating similarity between font keyword values and emotions extracted from content through deep learning emotion analysis. Considering the disparity in criteria utilized for classifying content emotions and font keywords, the necessity arose for a mapping model to evaluate the similarity between these two sets of criteria. Accordingly we designed our mapping model constructed based on the PAD model, a framework that represents emotions along three axes on a coordinate plane. We formulated two distinct methods to assess similarity: the first converts content and font characteristics into a single PAD value, subsequently discerning the distance; The second method analyzes the Pearson correlation coefficient between the criteria for emotional classification to determine the similarity. A comparative evaluation was conducted between these two methods. The results of the evaluation affirmed that the model reflecting the correlation coefficient yielded greater efficacy. As a result, we opted for this mapping model as the approach for calculating similarity between content and font."

According to previous studies, research based on deep learning using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features has been the dominant approach. We focus on the acoustic differences between regions and conduct dialect classification based on the extracted features derived from the differences. In this paper, we propose an approach of extracting underexplored additional features, namely the speed and the pauses of speech utterances along with the metadata including the age and the gender of the speakers. Experimental results show that our proposed approach results in higher accuracy, especially with the speech rate feature, compared to the method only using the MFCC features. The accuracy improved from 91.02% to 97.02% compared to the previous method that only used MFCC features, by incorporating all the proposed features in this paper."

Split liability assessment in car accident using 3D convolutional neural network,2023,"['car accident', 'split liability assessment', '3D convolution']",,"In a car accident, negligence is evaluated through a process known as split liability assessment. This assessment involves reconstructing the accident scenario based on information gathered from sources such as dashcam footage.

Therefore, accident cases for split liability assessment should be classified based on information affecting the negligence degree. While deep learning has recently been in the spotlight for video recognition using short video clips, no research has been conducted to extract meaningful information from long videos, which are necessary for split liability assessment. To address this issue, we propose a new task for analysing long videos by stacking the important information predicted through the 3D CNNs model. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by proposing a split liability assessment method using dashcam footage."

The Sokratic Seminar, which was embodied by taking ideas from Socrates' conversation method, is a model that improves students' communication skills and discussion skills. This method helps learners by stimulating thought processes that lead to a deep understanding rather than acquiring fragmentary facts about the text. This researcher devised a class by applying a socratic seminar discussion using the parts dealing with the ≪孟子≫ edition. The results are as follows.First, learner-led learning was achieved because even students who lacked achievement made questions and looked at the text repeatedly to participate in discussion activities using them.Second, students diagnosed their lives and society based on text through active discussion activities, and recognized that classical text was directly connected to problems in modern society and problems in their lives.Third, the socratic seminar discussion is a way to produce the best results, not to distinguish between superiority and inferiority, as in general discussion, so communication skills have improved by listening to each other's remarks and presenting alternatives when refuting.Chinese character classes using socratic seminar discussions can be a way to efficiently teach the content of the subject, and it is worth applying in the school field as it is one of the meaningful educational methods to develop learners' capabilities, and it is expected that follow-up models will continue actively in the future."

In Dawn, Lilith and Oankali constantly interact with each other through trans-corporeality, human Lilith becoming Oankali and Oankali becoming human. Lilith and Oankali recognize each other's differences and advance toward cosmic love by caring for and loving each other through change and creation. Lilith’s sexuality is not limited to maternal love for an ooloi, Nikanj, but a deep love for empathizing and embracing others by putting her whole being into relationships. Octavia Butler changes Lilith’s negative image of “the devil of the night” into a new image with warm love, acknowledging differences and pursuing change and creation through meeting the alien Oankali. During Nikanj’s transformation, Lilith takes care of it with all her heart and accepts the existence of a third sex through her sensual sexuality. When Nikanj is seriously injured in a battle with humans, Lilith is willing to take off her clothes in front of humans to save Nikanj. Lilith and Nikanj promote each other’s growth, and Lilith learns the world of Oankali through Nikanj and Nikanj also learns human emotions and the world through Lilith. And this way, Lilith and Nikanj continue to interact with each other through Trans-corporeality, permeating each other, and moving beyond the creation of an individual to help the creation of others. This is the ethics Butler presents to us in the posthuman era."
DRL-based Resource Management in Network Slicing for Vehicular Applications,2023,['5G network slicingResource allocationReal-time resource managementVehicular networksActor–critic DRL'],,"Network Slicing (NS) was proposed as a viable solution in Release 15 of Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to allocate the limited resources among different service types for improving their Quality-of-Service (QoS). However, the advanced vehicular applications such as autonomous driving, platooning, remote driving, etc. have stringent QoS demands and the standard NS architecture is not sustainable for these services. Therefore, we propose a solution compatible with the standard 3GPP NS architecture that implements an Actor-Critic based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm in the Network Slice Subnet Management Function (NSSMF). The algorithm allocates and manages the limited resources among different slices based on their real-time traffic demands. We generate real-time traffic for each service type and train the algorithm to improve the QoS of each service type in the network. The proposed method is evaluated for the training performance of the proposed algorithm as well as the Service level agreement Satisfaction Ratio (SSR) of each slice. The results exhibit that the proposed method not only improves SSR of each slice, but also performs well in case of increased node density in the network."
Towards automatic EEG cyclic alternating pattern analysis: a systematic review analysis: a systematic review,2023,"['A phase', 'Automatic classification', 'CAP', 'EEG']",,"This study conducted a systematic review to determine the feasibility of automatic Cyclic Alternating Pattern (CAP)analysis. Specifically, this review followed the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses(PRISMA) guidelines to address the formulated research question: is automatic CAP analysis viable for clinical application?From the identified 1,280 articles, the review included 35 studies that proposed various methods for examining CAP,including the classification of A phase, their subtypes, or the CAP cycles. Three main trends were observed over timeregarding A phase classification, starting with mathematical models or features classified with a tuned threshold, followedby using conventional machine learning models and, recently, deep learning models. Regarding the CAP cycle detection,it was observed that most studies employed a finite state machine to implement the CAP scoring rules, which depended onan initial A phase classifier, stressing the importance of developing suitable A phase detection models. The assessment ofA-phase subtypes has proven challenging due to various approaches used in the state-of-the-art for their detection, rangingfrom multiclass models to creating a model for each subtype. The review provided a positive answer to the main researchquestion, concluding that automatic CAP analysis can be reliably performed. The main recommended research agendainvolves validating the proposed methodologies on larger datasets, including more subjects with sleep-related disorders,and providing the source code for independent confirmation."

In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose a deep learning model DFLM (Deeplearning facial landmark model) that receives facial landmarks as input data and classifies facial emotions. The proposed DFLM can classify 7 facial expressions by constructing a fully connected neural network with 68 landmarks as inputs. As a result of the simulation, it is possible to learn faster than a CNN model, and its operation time is short, so it will be helpful in areas that need to make predictions in real time."
적대적 학습 기반 오토인코더(ATAE)를 이용한 다차원 상수도관망 데이터 생성,2023,['(ATAE)'],,"Recent advancements in data measuring technology have facilitated the installation of various sensors, such as pressure meters and flow meters, to effectively assess the real-time conditions of water distribution systems (WDSs). However, as cities expand extensively, the factors that impact the reliability of measurements have become increasingly diverse. In particular, demand data, one of the most significant hydraulic variable in WDS, is challenging to be measured directly and is prone to missing values, making the development of accurate data generation models more important. Therefore, this paper proposes an adversarially trained autoencoder (ATAE) model based on generative deep learning techniques to accurately estimate demand data in WDSs. The proposed model utilizes two neural networks: a generative network and a discriminative network. The generative network generates demand data using the information provided from the measured pressure data, while the discriminative network evaluates the generated demand outputs and provides feedback to the generator to learn the distinctive features of the data. To validate its performance, the ATAE model is applied to a real distribution system in Austin, Texas, USA. The study analyzes the impact of data uncertainty by calculating the accuracy of ATAE's prediction results for varying levels of uncertainty in the demand and the pressure time series data. Additionally, the model's performance is evaluated by comparing the results for different data collection periods (low, average, and high demand hours) to assess its ability to generate demand data based on water consumption levels."
Segmentation algorithm can be used for detecting hepatic fibrosis in SD rat,2023,"['Digital pathology', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Liver fibrosis', 'Cirrhosis', 'NDMA', 'NASH', 'Image segmentation']",,"Background: Liver fibrosis is an early stage of liver cirrhosis. As a reversible lesion before cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer, it has been a target for drug discovery. Many antifibrotic candidates have shown promising results in experimental animal models; however, due to adverse clinical reactions, most antifibrotic agents are still preclinical. Therefore, rodent models have been used to examine the histopathological differences between the control and treatment groups to evaluate the efficacy of anti-fibrotic agents in non-clinical research. In addition, with improvements in digital image analysis incorporating artificial intelligence (AI), a few researchers have developed an automated quantification of fibrosis. However, the performance of multiple deep learning algorithms for the optimal quantification of hepatic fibrosis has not been evaluated. Here, we investigated three different localization algorithms, mask R-CNN, DeepLabV3+, and SSD, to detect hepatic fibrosis.Results: 5750 images with 7503 annotations were trained using the three algorithms, and the model performance was evaluated in large-scale images and compared to the training images. The results showed that the precision values were comparable among the algorithms. However, there was a gap in the recall, leading to a difference in model accuracy. The mask R-CNN outperformed the recall value (0.93) and showed the closest prediction results to the annotation for detecting hepatic fibrosis among the algorithms. DeepLabV3+ also showed good performance; however, it had limitations in the misprediction of hepatic fibrosis as inflammatory cells and connective tissue. The trained SSD showed the lowest performance and was limited in predicting hepatic fibrosis compared to the other algorithms because of its low recall value (0.75).Conclusions: We suggest it would be a more useful tool to apply segmentation algorithms in implementing AI algorithms to predict hepatic fibrosis in non-clinical studies."

Therefore, we introduced a stamp-based distance method to compare several XAI algorithms and identify the most accurate algorithm. The proposed method involves evaluating the quality of explanations generated by XAI algorithms applied to a deep learning model trained to detect the presence of stamps in the MNIST dataset. This evaluation was performed using statistical techniques to determine the effectiveness of each XAI algorithm. This paper evaluated performances of LIME and SHAP algorithms using the distance method, which compared explanations produced by each algorithm. Result revealed that LIME with the Felzenszwalb method provided more effective explanations than other LIME and SHAP algorithms."

While the first and second industrial revolutions accelerated the automation of physical labor, the Fourth Industrial Revolution, represented by data-driven artificial intelligence, is revolutionizing cognitive labor automation in all industries. Initially, the goal of artificial intelligence was to implement systems that could make judgments like humans by transferring the knowledge accumulated by humans to computers. However, it has now evolved into data-driven artificial intelligence technologies such as machine learning and deep learning, enabling machines to develop capabilities similar to human abstract thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills, which were previously difficult to implement. Data-driven artificial intelligence will evolve in the future to compete or collaborate with humans in various fields. On the one hand, there is concern about artificial intelligence threatening our jobs, while on the other hand, we encounter chatbots or chat-based AI systems in our daily lives. Artificial intelligence is being integrated into processes in a variety of sectors such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, distribution, transportation, and electronics, becoming an integral part of our daily lives.In the future, there is a high possibility that personal proficiency and competence in digital technologies, particularly in handling artificial intelligence, will create social, cultural, and economic disparities. To adapt to such changes and promote human progress, it is crucial for humans and computers (artificial intelligence, robots) to move towards collaboration and coexistence, rather than confrontation and competition. By leveraging the strengths of both humans and artificial intelligence, we can achieve more effective and efficient outcomes. Humans can contribute their cognitive abilities, creativity, emotional intelligence, and ethical considerations, while AI can provide data analysis, pattern recognition, automation, and optimization capabilities. By designing collaborative models that effectively integrate human and AI capabilities, we can maximize the potential of both and create a synergistic relationship."

Dynamic service function chain placement with instance reuse in Fog–Cloud​ Computing,2023,['FCCNNFVVNFSFCDRLA3C'],,"The advent of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technology has brought flexible provisioning to Fog–Cloud Computing-based Networks (FCCNs) for enterprises to outsource their network functions to data center networks. Service Function Chaining (SFC) is a networking concept in NFV by which traffic is steered through an ordered set of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) composing an end-to-end service. When hundreds of users outsource their network functions to FCCN, the optimal placement of VNFs in the network becomes important for assembling SFCs with the aim of resource utilization efficiency. Motivated by the scalability shortcomings of existing schemes, we propose Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based approaches by simultaneously considering parallelized SFC and reuse of VNFs to solve this problem, i.e., Asynchronous Advantage Actor–Critic (A3C). A parallelized SFC consists of several sub-SFCs, which can reduce delay and guarantee availability. Also, reuse of preliminary VNFs in SFC placement can improve computation acceleration. The proposed scheme pursues the maximization of the long-term cumulative reward for the trade-off between Quality of Service (QoS) and service cost. The results of the experiments show that the proposed scheme performs better than the state-of-the-art methods."
Experimental study of cured dust layer structure parameters based on semantic segmentation,2023,"['Filtration', 'Ceramic Filter', 'Dust Layer', 'Curing', 'Semantic Segmentation']",,"The structural properties of the dust layer, including its thickness, porosity, and particle size distribution, play a critical role in ensuring the high precision and long-term stability of filter elements. However, observing these properties is challenging due to the weak adherence and cohesiveness of the layer. To address this issue, atomization thermosetting glue was used to achieve pre-curing, and the entire dust layer was cured with epoxy resin. After the sample was frozen and fractured using liquid nitrogen, the boundaries of the dust particles became plainly visible. Traditional binarization techniques were insufficient in identifying the edges of the dust particles since the grayscale values of particles and their environment partially overlap. As a result, a deep learning model based on the DeeplabV3+ network architecture was used to identify particles in the dust layer and achieved an accuracy of 90.99%. The research reveals that pulse-jet cleaning can double the thickness of the local dust layer on adjacent filter elements. Additionally, the surface morphology of the filter element significantly impacts the shape and thickness of the dust layer, causing it to change dramatically. Uneven thickness of the dust layer can result in a higher number of dust particles passing through the filter element membrane."

And, in relation to modern poetry education, sought to explore possibilities and limitations of link between elementary and middle schools which the 6th grade learners’ responses have shown. For this purpose, ‘enrichment’ was presented as a criterion for appropriate appreciation, which goes beyond the level in which the content of the work exists only as objective information. Rather, ‘enrichment’ is aim at deep relation to the life of the reader, and through this, the reader can find a new voice hidden behind the work with a new perspective. The results of learning activities with 7 elementary school learners, examining their reactions, and conducting interviews about them are as follows. First, the learners easily derived the theme of the work without any help of a researcher or a teacher. Second, they had the perception that the answer was guided to a fixed in the activities of the textbook, so they showed limited appreciations. Third, the exploratory attitude was not sufficiently expressed when the opportunity to freely express opinions was given. Fourth, when talking about their experiences, they showed considerable active initiative. Fifth, despite this, the learners did not advance to obtain rich appreciation by closely connecting their experiences with the world of works. Based on these results, this study presented the conclusion that it is difficult to deal with the work in earnest at the elementary school level, and at the same time suggested that it is possible to deal with both at the elementary and middle school levels. And we need to move the theory of grade from activity-property to several stages of reading depth."

In the automatically acquired crop image data, the environmental information from inside the greenhouse is used to predict the occurrence of diseases. In addition, by using light environment information such as insolation, light transmittance, and scattered light, crop diseases that were difficult to detect in the greenhouse demonstration environment were solved by applying pre-processing techniques such as the image conversion enhancement technique and fine parameter adjustment. As a result, the disease detection rate, which was 92.5% in 2020 in the existing demonstration environment, was raised to 95.2%. This was improved by more than 6.2%p when compared with the 89% maximum detection accuracy of the deep learning disease prediction model using keras.In other words, considering that the unseen data acquired from an external environment rather than an environment controlled by a laboratory was used (Practical outcome), it can be said that the disease classification accuracy is very high."

His remaining works related to Buddhism serve as important material for understanding the development of Buddhism during the Silla period, especially the after sect. His sense of orientation through Buddhist works can be organized into the following four points.Firstly, it is the establishment of the lineage of Avatamsaka. The main characters mentioned by Choi Go-un are people who have continued the line of the Avatamsaka School . Through this, he allowed readers to learn about the spread route of it’s sect to India, China, and the history of Avatamsaka studies in Silla.Secondly, it is the world of truth and a stable mind. The definition of Tao(道) that he spoke of is no different from the concept of Tao in the Analects of Confucius or the Mean. He pursued stability of mind by utilizing the meaning of Avatamsaka Samadhi[華嚴三昧].Thirdly he respect for life and stability of the country. On the one hand, he took the meaning of Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara[觀音菩薩] and valued life. The ideal world he pursued was a world of finalization and he hoped to save sentient beings and create a moral world.Fourthly, he pursued the world of fusion or harmony through central observation. After Choi Go-un left this world, he tried to fuse or harmonize affairs and reason based on the idea of Avatamsaka. His deep immersion in this ideology was intended to unite the divided ruling class and the ruled class at the time. When the mind is shaken or selfish desires arise the subject and object cannot fuse. Therefore he prioritized peace of mind."

In the first survey, 84.99% of the survey subjects saw that writing courses were needed for communication, and the response that writing courses was needed was high at 81.66%. This showed that the general perception about the writing learning of learners was positive. On the other hand, 45% responded that ‘writing was burdensome’, confirming that the burden felt by the learners cannot be ignored. In the second survey, 78.57% of the respondents said that ‘writing skills had improved’, and 66.06% said ‘burden on writing was reduced’. This can be seen as the result of gaining confidence by receiving positive feedback from instructors and peers in several writing exercises. In the third survey, 71.42% answered “yes”, a 33.09% increase compared to the first survey, to the question “Do you have the confidence to complete a piece of writing when given an assignment?”, and to the question ‘Can you express your thoughts in writing?’, 75% answered ‘yes’, a 31.68% increase from the first survey. The reason why learners' self-affirmation increased as so was because their self-efficacy improved by the successful experience achieved during repeated writing practice.‘Writing’ is a subject that learners take with great burden, and above all, classes should be planned with a deep understanding of learners. Through three surveys and analyzes conducted based on this perception, it was possible to more clearly grasp learners' perceptions and preferences related to writing. These results can be used as references when planning writing classes centered on the learners."

However it has a weak structure in terms of cybersecurity because only the reliability and efficiency were considered when CAN was developed. Since various cyberattacks are possible using these vulnerabilities, a lot of researches about intrusion detection through CAN traffic analysis have been actively conducted in order to cope with this problem. Recently, research using various deep learning models is underway to improve detection performance, but these detection models analyze the CAN message in the unit of traffic groups with a certain size and identify only whether an attack message exists in the group, so there is a limitation in that the detection models cannot identify which traffics are related with attacks. In this paper, we propose a CAN intrusion detection model using the Transformer model. By applying this detection model, more precise detection results can be presented because it can identify the attack traffics as well as the existence of attack traffics by analyzing the traffic at the signal level."

For these policy interventions to be effective, authorities engaged in the political discourse of legitimising their activity to generate positive public attitudes. To understand effective COVID-19 policy, this study investigates public attitudes in South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States and how they reflect different legitimisation of policy intervention. We adopt a big data approach to analyse public attitudes, drawing from public comments posted on Twitter during selected periods. We collect the number of tweets related to COVID-19 policy intervention and conduct a sentiment analysis using a deep learning method. Public attitudes and sentiments in the three countries show different patterns according to how policy interventions were implemented. Overall concern about policy intervention is higher in South Korea than in the other two countries. However, public sentiments in all three countries tend to improve following implementation of policy intervention. The findings suggest that governments can achieve policy effectiveness when consistent and transparent communication take place during the initial period of the pandemic. This study contributes to the existing literature by applying big data analysis to explain which policies engender positive public attitudes."

In 2022, the Movement Disorder Society proposed new diagnostic criteria to develop disease-modifying therapies and promote clinical trials of MSA since the second consensus was proposed in 2008. Regarding pathogenesis, cutting-edge findings have accumulated on the interactions of α-synuclein, neuroinflammation, and oligodendroglia with neurons. In neuroimaging, introducing artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning has notably improved diagnostic accuracy and individual analyses. Advancements in treatment have also been achieved, including immunotherapy therapy against α-synuclein and serotonin-targeted and mesenchymal stem cell therapies, which are thought to affect several aspects of the disease, including neuroinflammation. The accelerated progress in clarifying the pathogenesis of MSA over the past few years and the development of diagnostic techniques for detecting early-stage MSA are expected to facilitate the development of disease-modifying therapies for one of the most intractable neurodegenerative diseases."

An AI artwork won an award and caused controversy at an art exhibition held in the United States. However, research on image-generative AI is still limited and mainly focuses on technical aspects, such as content development. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to provide basic data on how to use image-generative AI in the future and to suggest directions for its use by examining the types of image-generative AI currently available on online platforms and analyzing ways to utilize them. (Method) This study first examined the concept of neural network deep learning and the types and utilization cases of image-generative AI through a literature review, and then found representative cases of each type of image-generative AI to analyze its utilization characteristics. Among the image-generative AIs available online as of October 31, 2022, those with clear cases of transfer, translation, and extension were selected as representative cases. To analyze the utilization of the representative cases, four types of detailed information were used as scales: input method, image style, sample suggestion, and utilization. Subsequently, detailed scales were applied to each representative case to analyze its characteristics. (Results) First, Midjourney, a representative AI image generator that uses image transfer, generates images using a text-to-image method and is used to create images in a pictorial style. Second, Artbreeder, a representative AI image generator that uses image translation, creates a new translation by uploading an existing image or adjusting a slider on an already created image and is used for a photo-realistic or semi-realistic image style. Third, Dall-E 2, a representative AI image generator that uses image extension, extends the image or modifies its contents using inpainting and outpainting techniques, and is easy to use for photo-style images. Regarding the utilization characteristics of image-generative AI, the convenience varies depending on the input method and various translations of images are possible depending on the effects provided by the tool. The difference in the number of samples makes it easier to obtain the desired image. (Conclusions) Image-generative AIs use different input methods and image styles based on transfer, translation, and extension. Therefore, users must select and use appropriate image transfer, translation, and extension AIs depending on the purpose of image utilization."

Within the realm of early AI development, the legal field has been particularly focused on the allocation of responsibilities related to self-driving cars and the implications for insurance systems. These discussions aim to tackle emerging legal disputes resulting from the widespread adoption of AI technology and strive for equitable resolutions. Another significant area of discourse revolves around the potential integration of AI technology in the legal profession, specifically exploring the feasibility of employing “artificial intelligence judges.” Contrary to initial expectations, AI has made significant strides, overcoming past periods of stagnation referred to as “AI winters.” In the near future, AI is poised to surpass its current capabilities, which mainly involve leveraging deep learning techniques on extensive judicial data to identify the most relevant case precedents. Instead, it holds the potential to generate comprehensive legal judgments or tailored reasoning for specific cases, thereby making substantial advancements in the judicial process. Efforts to incorporate AI into legal procedures are already underway, with even our Supreme Court exploring its utilization. For example, a policy research service project called the “Introduction of the Next-Generation Electronic Litigation System” is being implemented with the goal of adopting it by 2024.This article specifically focuses on the subfield of research known as “Artificial Intelligence for Law” within the broader context of “Artificial Intelligence and Law.” It delves into the fundamental principles of AI technology, the concept of AI trials, and presents the rationale for embracing AI trials as a legitimate component of judicial procedures, particularly within civil lawsuits. Furthermore, the article examines the current state of AI adoption in civil judicial procedures, both at the national and international levels. It sheds light on practical applications of AI technology in legal judgments and litigation processes, exploring specific domains where AI is already being employed. Additionally, it discusses instances of AI utilization in administrative acts or administrative litigation, expanding the potential areas where AI trials could be implemented in civil judicial procedures in the future. Lastly, the article addresses the challenges associated with the use of AI in legal contexts and outlines improvement plans. It highlights potential issues that may arise and proposes strategies to mitigate them, ensuring the effective and ethical incorporation of AI technology in the field of law."
Reconstructing room scales with a single sound for augmented reality displays,2023,['Scene perceptionmulti-modalaudio listeningacoustic propagationaugmented reality'],,"Perception and reconstruction of our 3D physical environment is an essential task with broad applications for Augmented Reality (AR) displays. For example, reconstructed geometries are commonly leveraged for displaying 3D objects at accurate positions. While camera-captured images are a frequently used data source for realistically reconstructing 3D physical surroundings, they are limited to line-of-sight environments, requiring time-consuming and repetitive data-capture techniques to capture a full 3D picture. For instance, current AR devices require users to scan through a whole room to obtain its geometric sizes. This optical process is tedious and inapplicable when the space is occluded or inaccessible. Audio waves propagate through space by bouncing from different surfaces, but are not 'occluded' by a single object such as a wall, unlike light. In this research, we aim to ask the question ‘can one hear the size of a room?’. To answer that, we propose an approach for inferring room geometries only from a single sound, which we define as an audio wave sequence played from a single loud speaker, leveraging deep learning for decoding implicitly-carried spatial information from a single speaker-and-microphone system. Through a series of experiments and studies, our work demonstrates our method's effectiveness at inferring a 3D environment's spatial layout. Our work introduces a robust building block in multi-modal layout reconstruction."

Especially, I pay attention to the cinema that is considered ‘poetic.’ The poetic cinema can be defined as a cinema that has the mood, emotion and expression of poetry. In order to identify the characteristics of the poetic cinema, the characteristics of the ‘poetic’ must be defined.A representative characteristic of the poetry distinguished from the narrative genre is that it pays attention to the moment. The focus on the moment makes the text of poetry short. And as the length is short, poetry consists of efficient expressions that convey many meanings in less words. Therefore, poetry is characterized by speaking through silence, using metaphors to imply deep contemplation, and creating rhythms to express the delicate atmosphere. Accordingly, the characteristics of poetic cinema include making the audience think for themselves through silence, deriving new meanings through figurative expressions of montage technique, and forming rhythms through repetition and variation.When we define a poetic cinema as a cinema that utilizes silence, metaphors and rhythms, poetic moments can be experienced when a cinema uses silence rather than words, uses metaphors rather than directness, and creates rhythmic movements. In this paper, I analyze <First Cow>, <AFTER YANG> and <Paterson> to embody the poetic moments when the audience thinks on their own through silence, recognizes new meanings through montage, and feels rhythm through repetition and variation. Presenting poems can be an appropriate help for learners when they interpret the expressions of the poetic cinema, because poems are the texts that learners appreciate more often in the educational field and they show the most sophisticated and beautiful examples using silence, metaphors and rhythms.The ultimate goal of poetry education is to make learners think not only about the texts but also about the life and the world in their creative way. If learners can appreciate various visual media in a poetic way, they can learn unique perspectives of the life and the world in various ways. The exploration of poetic cinema can be an attempt to expand the realm of poetry education and a search for various possibilities of cinema education."

Noninvasive imaging biomarkers for liver fibrosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: current and future,2023,"['Diagnostic imaging', 'Biomarkers', 'Liver fibrosis', 'Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease']",,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasingly prevalent worldwide and becoming a major cause of liver disease-related morbidity and mortality. The presence of liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD is closely related to prognosis, including the development of hepatocellular carcinoma and other complications of cirrhosis. Therefore, assessment of the presence of significant or advanced liver fibrosis is crucial. Although liver biopsy has been considered the “gold standard” method for evaluating the degree of liver fibrosis, it is not suitable for extensive use in all patients with NAFLD owing to its invasiveness and high cost. Therefore, noninvasive biochemical and imaging biomarkers have been developed to overcome the limitations of liver biopsy. Imaging biomarkers for the stratification of liver fibrosis have been evaluated in patients with NAFLD using different imaging techniques, such as transient elastography, shear wave elastography, and magnetic resonance elastography. Furthermore, artificial intelligence and deep learning methods are increasingly being applied to improve the diagnostic accuracy of imaging techniques and overcome the pitfalls of existing imaging biomarkers. In this review, we describe the usefulness and future prospects of noninvasive imaging biomarkers that have been studied and used to evaluate the degree of liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD."

Financial statements can be regarded as the key source of information to obtain the operating conditions of listed companies. Current research focuses more on mining financial digital data instead of looking into text data. However, text data can reveal emotional information, which is an important basis for detecting financial fraud. The audit opinion of the financial statement is especially the fair opinion of a certified public accountant on the quality of enterprise financial reports. Therefore, this research was carried out by using the data features of 4,153 listed companies' financial annual reports and audits of text opinions in the past six years, and the paper puts forward a financial fraud detection model integrating audit opinions. First, the financial data index database and audit opinion text database were built. Second, digitized audit opinions with deep learning Bert model was employed. Finally, both the extracted audit numerical characteristics and the financial numerical indicators were used as the training data of the LightGBM model. What is worth paying attention to is that the imbalanced distribution of sample labels is also one of the focuses of financial fraud research.

This can be effective when there is no difference in the required amount for goods, but when there is a difference in the required amount for goods, it is inefficient because items with a small required amount are loaded near the entrance and occupy the corresponding space for a long time. Therefore, in order to minimize the release time of goods, it is essential to select an appropriate location when loading goods. In this study, a method for determining the loading location by predicting the required amount of goods was studied to select the optimal loading location.

An empirical wavelet transform (EWT), Teager Kaiser energy changes (TKE) and Random Forest (RF) based new scheme is proposed to assess TSA. Based on the generator bus frequency and angles, a novel Robust Transient Stability Index (RTSI) is proposed to capture real-time status of power network. The EWT is utilized to decompose the proposed multi-component index into various intrinsic mode functions (modes). Subsequently, instantaneous energy change within each mode is calculated using Teager–Kaiser energy operator (TKEO). The energy changes in each mode defines decision boundary between transient stable and unstable operating scenario. Finally, for each mode, standard deviation of these energy changes is obtained to measure the variations in energy change about mean value. The Random Forest classification scheme is developed to obtain the TSA in real-time. The developed classifier predicts TSA using standard deviation of these energy changes. Simulation results and comparison with relevance minimum redundancy arithmetic, deep imbalanced learning framework and improved support vector machine methods demonstrates capability of the proposed scheme."

This paper presents an intelligent fault diagnosis method for rolling bearings based on a similarity clustering multi-channel convolution neural network with the hierarchical branch (HB-SC-MCCNN). First, the relevant features are extracted by MCCNN, and combined with the similarity clustering principle, the accurate binary classification is realized in the case of insufficient labeled data. Second, the similarity clustering module and additional loss are added to the SC-MCCNN network to form a hierarchical-branch network, which simplifies the problem of fault multi-classification into binary classification with multiple steps, and to reduces the dependence on the amount of label data in multi-classification. Finally, based on the self-learning characteristics of HB-SC-MCCNN, the unlabeled data and the missing fault types in the training set are re-labeled to realize the re-training of the network.

Creating AI works, deepfakes, and virtual reality are representative cultural and artistic contents using artificial intelligence.Music is one of the most active area for the use of artificial intelligence. Under the clear systems such as beats, notes, harmonies, and composition, numerous experiments and achievements have accumulated, evolving into more precise and extensive AI, but all of these artificial intelligences are based on “Western music.” Since ‘music theory’ and ‘big data’ are needed to utilize artificial intelligence, there is a limit to developing artificial intelligence contents in the field of Korean traditional music.In the case of using artificial intelligence in the field of Korean traditional music, deep learning and evolutionary algorithm-based creation have been attempted several times, and in addition, there are development of performance robots, collection and dataization of augmented reality and digital content. Recently, artificial intelligence-related departments and research institutes are showing interest in expanding their scope to Korean traditional music. However, the reality is that various efforts are needed to be activated due to high entry barriers and low infrastructure.In introducing artificial intelligence technology, the biggest advantage of folk songs is rich data. A vast amount of sound sources and lyrics are recorded, and various categories can be classified according to the function, region, and singer's expertise. On the other hand, the reality of traditional music, in which various music theories are juxtaposed, acts as an obstacle when meeting artificial intelligence and digital content. In addition, the limitations of folk songs are that it is difficult to obtain digitally converted data and that copyrights are not clear.Putting these situations together, this article presents pre-emptive conditions and directions for content development that can be realized in the near future for folk songs to be effectively used in the cultural industry based on the Fourth Industrial Revolution while utilizing the advantages and utility of folk songs. First, the establishment of a public database of digital sound sources, music scores, and songs, secondly, the establishment of a theoretical system of folk songs, thirdly, the development of traditional music creation algorithms, and fourthly, the development of new technology convergence data.Finally, it was emphasized that ‘sharing’ and ‘solidarity’ of various public institutions and private organizations are necessary for the use of artificial intelligence of folk songs and also for the preservation and spread of folk songs."

Additionally, both algorithms consistently outperformed other algorithms in tracking the relative position changes between moving objects and the drone, as well as changes in the intensity of moving objects. The results confirmed that training data can be efficiently obtained from drone images."

Real-Time Tunnel Abnormal Sound Detection Algorithm Using Convolutional Neural Networks,2023,"['Convolutional Neural Networks', 'Acoustic-based Accident Detection System (AADS)', 'Real-time Accident Detection System', 'Audio Classification', 'Car Crash Sound', 'Tire Skid Sound', 'Signal Processing']",,"In the traffic industry, the automatic accident detection system is a major concern. Although image-based and radar-based traffic accident detection systems are commonly employed, they have several drawbacks, including the need to secure the camera's field of view, a high rate of false alarms, and a lengthy detection time. Using a real-time acoustic surveillance system and the classification algorithm via Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), this article proposes several methods for identifying abnormal situations, such as a car crash or tire skid sound, to overcome the limitations of existing methods. We create an audio database by collecting sounds from two tunnels in South Korea using self-made microphones for eight months and classifying them into three categories: car crash, tire skid, and normal environmental sounds. We establish a three-step classification procedure using an algorithm. We compare the detection rate and false alarm rate of our proposed method to those of deep learning techniques including MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron), Long-Short Term Memory, ShuffleNetv2, and MobileNetv2. In addition, we present a method for filtering out irrelevant sound data to improve the computational efficiency of our approach."

His father is said to have worked in land sales and Currency Exchange. In 1274, Dante met Beatrice for the first time at the age of nine and said: ""Nine times after my birth the sky of light had returned almost to the same point, as regards its own rotation, when There before my eyes appeared the glorious lady of my mind, who was called by many Beatrice.Her name is known as Bice di Folco Portinari, and she married Simone dei Bardi di Bardi, an important family of Florence at the time. He was born in 1266 and died at a young age in 1290. Dante promised to marry Gemma di Mnetto Donati in 1277 and married her in 1285. It is said that he had three children, Jacopo, Pietro and Antonia, and some scholars maintain that he first had a son of name John. Among his closest friends were Gianni Alfani and Lapo Gianni, and he had a special relationship with Guido Cavalcanti as a literary scholar. It is known that in 1287 he stayed in Bologna and attended the university, where he became acquainted with the poetry of Guiniselli. This experience had a significant impact not only on Dante's 『 Vita Nova』 but also on 『Rima』.Dante experiences Beatrice's death at the age of about twenty-five and falls into deep grief. Subsequently he realizes that moral life is not perfect, he renounces the ideal love expressed through Beatrice and turns to philosophy. He studied theology by visiting the main religious institutions of Florence. Santa Maria Novella S followed the ideas of Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas. The Dominican priests of the Cathedral of Maria Novella and Santa Croce S. were very interested in issues related to the drastic improvement of the corrupt religious world. Above all, I learn a lot from the Franciscan priests of the Cathedral of the Cross. Furthermore, thanks to the friendship he shared with Brunetto Latini, an expert in oral techniques and French literature, who like him taught him, it became an opportunity to deepen his philosophical studies. These things were done mainly after Beatrice's death, and were of great help in reinterpreting the literary experiences of her youth in 『Nuova Vita』.Academically, Dante diligently read and studied the Latin poets (Virgil, Horace, Ovid, Lucan, Cicero), and although he did not know Greek well, he studied the philosophy of Aristotle through the Latin translation and the annotations of Thomas (Inf. IV ). Furthermore, he dedicated himself to theological research, and in particular, in addition to the aforementioned Thomas and Albertus Magnus, he studied Boethius and Saint Augustine in depth. In the meantime, Dante also participated in the real politics of the time: in 1289 he participated as a knight in the battle of Campaldino and in the attack on the castle of Caprona against the Ghibellines of Arezzo, achieving victory. In 1295 Dante obtained the rank of noble by joining the guild of doctors and apothecaries, indispensable for his active political activity. Subsequently he becomes Priori, the highest position one can achieve as a citizen."

Multivariate Congestion Prediction using Stacked LSTM Autoencoder based Bidirectional LSTM Model,2023,"['Autoencoder', 'Bidirectional LSTM', 'Convolutional neural network', 'Congestion prediction', 'Spatio-temporal data', 'traffic flow forecasting']",,"In intelligent transportation systems, traffic management is an important task. The accurate forecasting of traffic characteristics like flow, congestion, and density is still active research because of the non-linear nature and uncertainty of the spatiotemporal data. Inclement weather, such as rain and snow, and other special events such as holidays, accidents, and road closures have a significant impact on driving and the average speed of vehicles on the road, which lowers traffic capacity and causes congestion in a widespread manner. This work designs a model for multivariate short-term traffic congestion prediction using SLSTM_AE-BiLSTM. The proposed design consists of a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory(BiLSTM) network to predict traffic flow value and a Convolutional Neural network (CNN) model for detecting the congestion status. This model uses spatial static temporal dynamic data. The stacked Long Short Term Memory Autoencoder (SLSTM AE) is used to encode the weather features into a reduced and more informative feature space. BiLSTM model is used to capture the features from the past and present traffic data simultaneously and also to identify the long-term dependencies. It uses the traffic data and encoded weather data to perform the traffic flow prediction. The CNN model is used to predict the recurring congestion status based on the predicted traffic flow value at a particular urban traffic network. In this work, a publicly available Caltrans PEMS dataset with traffic parameters is used. The proposed model generates the congestion prediction with an accuracy rate of 92.74% which is slightly better when compared with other deep learning models for congestion prediction."

However, among the contents provided by virtual humans, there may be things that do not infringe copyrights as unique creations and things that do not infringe copyrights. In particular, the possibility of copyright infringement exists in a situation where a large number of materials are being used to train artificial intelligence without special restrictions, except for materials related to personal information. So, this thesis, after examining the meaning of virtual humans, looked into the attribution of rights to creations by virtual humans, the possibility of copyright infringement by virtual humans, and who is responsible for copyright infringement.First of all, currently the data provided by virtual humans are mainly provided by humans, so if they meet the definition of copyrighted work, they can be copyrighted works, and if copyright infringement is established, the provider is responsible for the copyright infringement. However, virtual humans based on artificial intelligence at a low level provide creations as results by algorithms provided by humans, and virtual humans equipped with artificial intelligence using high-level machine learning such as deep learning can provide creations themselves. Both creations may be subject to copyright infringement as various materials are used, so a problem of copyright infringement may occur.In principle, since virtual humans based on artificial intelligence are not human beings, the data created by them do not constitute copyrighted works under the Copyright Act, so copyright infringement does not arise. However, if copyrighted works are used in the process, it may lead to copyright infringement. And if the virtual human only did the work of simply collecting and combining data by the algorithm provided by the developer, the result could be established as a copyrighted work, and the developer could become the copyright holder for it. However, in the process of using the data by artificial intelligence, copyright infringement on other people's works may occur. In addition, even if a virtual human imitates or knits an existing work without human help, it can infringe on the copyright of others in the same way.And, the criminal law recognizes only natural persons with criminal capacity and  it is a person and a corporation that can be the subject of rights or tort capacity under civil law. In addition, since virtual humans are not human beings, those cannot be employees, so creations by virtual humans does not constitute a business work. Furthermore, for the same reason those cannot be the principal offender of copyright infringement, so abet of their owners cannot be established either. However, if the provision of content by virtual humans, such as virtual influencers, is viewed as a service, direct infringement liability of the service provider may arise in case that the service provider directly provides creations that infringe copyright through virtual humans and liability as an online service provider may arise to those who provide artificial intelligence services in case artificial intelligence provides creations that infringe on the copyrighted works of others according to the instructions of virtual human users. In addition, there is a problem with the owner's liability for torts under the civil law for the infringement of virtual humans. Regarding this issue, it may be possible to create new provisions similar to the liability provisions of animal possessors or to hold tort liability under section 760."

This study examines the utilization of civil language by members during standing committee meetings, with a specific focus on the minutes. The objective is to analyze politicians’ speeches and utilize the findings to encourage the adoption of civil political language in public discourse. This study presents a novel approach that integrates the assessment of positive and respectful language with the evaluation of negative speech, encompassing the use of profanity and impolite comments. This approach was produced after thorough theoretical deliberations. The initial phase of the investigation was the implementation of the negative speech evaluation approach, which was subsequently followed by the development of a hierarchical list based on positive speech assessment. The initial phase of the negative speech analysis involved employing a methodology to assess the utilization of profanity in the politicians’ statements. This methodology was derived from the Standard Encyclopedia Dictionary published by the National Institute of Korean Language. Subsequently, the analysis progressed by employing text mining techniques to index the precise verbal expressions used. Additionally, the researchers conducted a random sampling review and conducted searches on news articles and YouTube to further augment the analysis. Furthermore, a contextual approach was utilized in the study, employing deep learning natural language processing algorithms, specifically BERT, to effectively comprehend the contextual nuances of the speech, ranging from individual sentences to entire paragraphs. The analysis of positive speech entailed identifying the most commonly used phrases and assessing them based on 16 expressions across five theoretical dimensions related to dignity and communicability. These dimensions include ‘courtesy and respect’, ‘advice’, ‘opinion inquiry’, ‘fact verification’‘ and ‘statement format’. The ultimate ranking was determined by considering both the frequency of speech and the weighted value assigned to dignified discourse. This study is anticipated to provide a valuable contribution towards the advancement of methodologies for assessing the utilization of civil language by politicians and the dissemination of a culture that promotes civil language use."

These AI systems create new content or predict outcomes based on input data, relying on deep learning and reinforcement to learn patterns and relationships from extensive historical data. However, if pre-trained on biased, incomplete, or unrepresentative data, generative AI models may produce misleading or false outputs. The training data often reflects societal biases or perpetuates past prejudices, such as gender, race, age, and socio-economic biases. AI systems may learn to make assumptions based on gender stereotypes, develop biases against certain racial or ethnic groups, reveal distorted views related to socio-economic factors, or exhibit biases based on age, geography, language, political beliefs, culture, or religion, leading to discrimination. As these systems permeate various sectors, including employment, finance, education, and public services, concerns about biases have recently emerged.Addressing bias in generative AI is challenging but critical for responsible and equitable technology usage nowadays. Addressing AI bias involves not only technical solutions but also ethical considerations, such as fairness, transparency, accountability, and inclusivity. By improving data management, monitoring, developing fairness-aware algorithms, and implementing effective legal and policy responses, stakeholders can promote a more just and inclusive society. National and international level’s commitment to addressing AI bias and other ethical concerns in the development and deployment of AI systems is needed. As AI technologies continue to advance and become more integrated into society, it is crucial for governments, industries, and academia to collaborate in establishing comprehensive legal frameworks and ethical guidelines that ensure responsible AI development and usage.

In addition, the subjective opinion of the medical staff may be included in determining whether an early onset or not. In this paper, the background and the corneal ulcer area were separated using various image preprocessing methods for the Intraocular image, and the light reflection area was treated with a labeling method. For each result of applying Otsu's threshold and K-means clustering algorithm, the corneal ulcer area was detected using the Flood-Fill algorithm, and both methods were selectively applied to derive a better image as the final result. As a result of comparing the application images of the two algorithms shown in the experimental results, the corneal ulcer region extracted from the Otsu's threshold algorithm application image was wider than the corneal ulcer region extracted by applying the K-means clustering algorithm, so this was used. In this study, we proposed a method for calculating the proportion of non-overlapping corneal ulcer regions in the corneal ulcer region extracted after application of Otsu's threshold algorithm in the two resulting images, and finally selecting an algorithm to be applied. As a result of the whole process, 90.54% accuracy was shown when measuring the Dice Coefficient, and the Mean Accuracy value showed an accuracy of 97.45%. In the future, we plan to continue our research to enable more accurate image segmentation using deep learning techniques."

This dependency is predicted to escalate, implying that roles traditionally undertaken by humans may be incrementally supplanted by AI. Should we encounter a world governed by entities mirroring us without profound contemplation on the significance of human existence, we risk losing our societal positioning. This study endeavors to explore the concept of AI —particularly as it develops in a manner akin to human evolution— and investigates strategies for engaging with it through the lens of Christian liberal arts.Christian liberal arts are perceived herein as a methodological framework that applies Christian values to the subjects and objectives of a conventional and universal liberal arts education, with an aim to cultivate a mature selfhood. This approach seeks to enhance Christian literacy in the contemporary era and broaden the application of Christian values through critical integration.Initially, this study discusses the origins and essence of AI from both humanistic and technological standpoints. While AI appears to have emulated human cognitive abilities somewhat successfully, particularly in aspects such as “autonomy,” “growth via learning,” and “linguistic capability” through artificial neural network models and deep learning technologies, its foundational algorithms and computational procedures present a qualitative divergence from human cognitive processes. Consequently, it becomes crucial to question the Christian perspective on the inherent roles and existential significance of humans that preserve the qualitative distinctions between humans and AI.The Bible characterizes humans as the “image of God” (Gen 1:26-27). In the same vein, “image” does not denote “homogeneity,” thereby cautioning against conflating similarity and homogeneity between humans and AI. It is essential to establish an ontological hierarchy based on the explicit qualitative disparities between humans and AI. According to biblical teachings, a profound relationship is forged between God and humans through the ‘spirit.’ However, humans have yet to devise mechanisms to form intimate relationships with AI. Hence, it would be infeasible to anticipate similar interactions with AI as we do with fellow humans. Recognizing that humans are organic beings amalgamated through a physical body, spirit, and mind helps us avoid the pitfall of a mechanistic perspective that attempts to define human existence through data and intelligence alone. Therefore, in order to continue maintaining our autonomous role as humans, we must deeply reflect on the meaning of our own existence."

Accuratenuclide analysis is necessary to manage the radioactive wastes safely, but research on verification ofradionuclide analysis has yet to be well established. This study aimed to develop the technology thatcan verify the results of radionuclide analysis based on artificial intelligence. In this study, we proposean anomaly detection algorithm for inspecting the analysis error of radionuclide. We used the datafrom ‘Updated Scaling Factors in Low-Level Radwaste’ (NP-5077) published by EPRI (Electric PowerResearch Institute), and resampling was performed using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority OversamplingTechnique) algorithm to augment data. 149,676 augmented data with SMOTE algorithm was used totrain the artificial neural networks (classification and anomaly detection networks). 324 NP-5077 reportdata verified the performance of networks. The anomaly detection algorithm of radionuclide analysiswas divided into two modules that detect a case where radioactive waste was incorrectly classified ordiscriminate an abnormal data such as loss of data or incorrectly written data. The classification networkwas constructed using the fully connected layer, and the anomaly detection network was composedof the encoder and decoder. The latter was operated by loading the latent vector from the end layer ofthe classification network. This study conducted exploratory data analysis (i.e., statistics, histogram, correlation, covariance, PCA, k-mean clustering, DBSCAN). As a result of analyzing the data, it iscomplicated to distinguish the type of radioactive waste because data distribution overlapped each other.In spite of these complexities, our algorithm based on deep learning can distinguish abnormal data fromnormal data. Radionuclide analysis was verified using our anomaly detection algorithm, and meaningfulresults were obtained."
Real-time unmanned aerial vehicle flight path prediction using a bi-directional long short-term memory network with error compensation,2023,"['unmanned aerial vehicle', 'path prediction', 'Bessel coordinate transform', 'online training', 'long short-term memory']",,"In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomous flight technology has been applied in many fields. However, in the process of autonomous operation, the UAV may deviate from the set flight path due to various disturbance factors, which results in mission failure. In order to find the abnormal situation in time and take corresponding measures, it is necessary to monitor the operation state of the UAV. Predicting the UAV flight path is the main monitoring method at present; however, the accuracy and real-time of the existing prediction methods are limited. Therefore, this paper proposes an error compensation Bessel bidirectional long short-term memory real-time path prediction model deployed in ground stations. First, because of inconsistency of the units in all directions of the original positioning information provided by global positioning system, the Bessel geodetic coordinate transformation is introduced to unify the units of three-dimensional coordinate data, so as to improve the prediction accuracy. Second, considering the problems of poor data quality and data missing in the operation process, the least square fitting method is used to supplement and correct the positioning coordinate data to obtain more reliable and accurate path observation values as the model input. Finally, a deep learning path prediction model based on bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network is constructed, and the appropriate network parameters are determined with the prediction accuracy and time as evaluation indicators. In order to further improve the prediction accuracy, a compensator based on proportional integral differential error control theory is designed according to the output characteristics of the BiLSTM network, which is used for providing compensation values for the prediction results of the model. The training and testing results using the actual flight data of UAV operation show that, under the experimental environment built, the model proposed in this paper can complete the UAV flight path prediction with root mean square error < 1 meter within 0.1 second, and has better performance and higher prediction accuracy than other neural network models."

Comparative Study of Automatic Trading and Buy-and-Hold in the S&P 500 Index Using a Volatility Breakout Strategy,2023,"['변동성돌파', '자동매매', '인공지능 예측', '주가예측', 'volatility breakout strategy', 'auto trading', 'AI prediction', 'stock prediction']",,"This research is a comparative analysis of the U.S. S&P 500 index using the volatility breakout strategy against the Buy and Hold approach. The volatility breakout strategy is a trading method that exploits price movements after periods of relative market stability or concentration. Specifically, it is observed that large price movements tend to occur more frequently after periods of low volatility. When a stock moves within a narrow price range for a while and then suddenly rises or falls, it is expected to continue moving in that direction. To capitalize on these movements, traders adopt the volatility breakout strategy. The 'k' value is used as a multiplier applied to a measure of recent market volatility.One method of measuring volatility is the Average True Range (ATR), which represents the difference between the highest and lowest prices of recent trading days. The 'k' value plays a crucial role for traders in setting their trade threshold. This study calculated the 'k' value at a general level and compared its returns with the Buy and Hold strategy, finding that algorithmic trading using the volatility breakout strategy achieved slightly higher returns. In the future, we plan to present simulation results for maximizing returns by determining the optimal 'k' value for automated trading of the S&P 500 index using artificial intelligence deep learning techniques."

However, decisions in tourism development related to ethnic minorities being made by developers and managers, fostering of professionals of this field not being carried out, and the profits generated from tourism development being concentrated only on some of the tourism-related minorities all result in them not being able to become self-sufficient.Although implementing developers and managers in the field of ethnic minority tourism is important, since minorities are also the part of their region’s community, the problem in question has to be solved by either actively including the members of the minorities, or by achieving that the benefits of tourism are distributed to the majority instead of just a small number of participants so that locals can become the leaders. With the government’s growing ambition to develop ethnic minority tourism, a host’s point of view is needed in order for the minorities’ unique cultures to be preserved and maintained in their original forms. Thus, a specific and deep understanding of fostering professionals in the field of ethnic minority tourism is necessary in order for the members of minorities to be able to independently discover tourism resources and operate businesses and projects instead of being merely the objects in the process of tourism development.However, measures are insufficient as research on fostering professionals of ethnic minority tourism is mainly theoretical. This study aims to seek measures on how to foster professionals in order to boost ethnic minority tourism through examining the case of Tourism Dure, a CBT project focusing on training locals to become tourism professionals.The ways of fostering professionals applying the case of Tourism Dure are the following:First, a management team in charge of the fostering process has to be appointed, and a region for demonstration has to be selected - a region that is either ready to take up on fostering professionals or that has high resource potential. Second, in order to foster professionals in the field of ethnic minority tourism, it is necessary to launch an educational program through which the members of minorities can learn how to play a leading role in solving their region’s problems. Third, similarly to the Tourism Dure project, it is necessary to develop and manage the performance of professionals through the right quantitative and qualitative indicators.Based on the above, the writer’s goal is to present an academic and policy-related viewpoint on fostering professionals in order to revitalize ethnic minority tourism."

For empirical analysis, the growth (height) of crops was predicted using the field data of smart farms in the Rural Development Administration (February-September 2021) and environmental data that are the environmental determinants of height. Through LSTM, the growth of crops can be predicted by analyzing the temperature data before the reference point, not the production amount for temporary temperature, and the yield can be increased. As a result of the analysis, it was found that LSTM, which considers the characteristics of the crop, is superior to multiple regression analysis, which focuses on causal analysis by considering the characteristics of crops that grow over time. Through the results of this study, we have drawn theoretical implications that LSTM is more suitable for agricultural analysis than multiple regression analysis in the smart farm algorithm market, and practical implications that artificial neural networks can replace experience in agriculture and provide technology more efficiently to farmers. In addition, it is a continuous and realistic analysis method in that it considers the data of past experience, which is better than the existing deep learning method, and especially the existing algorithm is a one-sided analysis method that focuses only on technical aspects, while LSTM has an agricultural domain that reflects the understanding of actual farmers. It proves that it is a two-way analysis method that is in line with management strategic algorithms."

In this study, we focus on the phenomenon of shifting from designer-centered logo design creation methods to AI logo maker platforms. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to discuss the characteristics of the creative process of logo makers and the changed design environment based on artificial intelligence technology. To this end, this study examines the theoretical background through a review of the concept of AI, types of creative work and cases, and the development and status of AI technology. Through case studies, this study examines the process and characteristics of AI logo maker platforms. These platforms use rule-based processes that generate results automatically based on user input conditions and options, using an expert system. The process involves four steps: users input information and select options, generate initial logos, customize logos using logo maker tools, and generate final logos and application design. The AI logo maker platform enhances or augments design through AI technology, and streamlines the logo design process through a logo maker tool and a structured process. The platform uses machine learning and deep learning technology, allowing even non-professionals to easily create logos and design results at a low cost within a short period of time. However, there are issues such as overlooking the importance of brand strategy, semantic ambiguity and lack of relevance in the logo, and issues with similar shapes and non-discriminatory results in the logo creation process of AI logo maker platforms."

Accordingly, when selecting buildings subject to safety inspection, appropriate safety inspection standards and appropriate technology are essential. The current safety inspection standards for old buildings give low scores when it is difficult to confirm damage such as cracks in structural members due to finishing materials. This causes the evaluation results to be underestimated regardless of the actual safety status of the structure, resulting in an increase in the number of aging buildings subject to safety inspection. Accordingly, this study proposed a thermal imaging technique, a non-destructive and non-contact inspection, to detect cracks inside finishing materials. A concrete specimen was produced to observe cracks inside the finishing material using a thermal imaging camera, and thermal image data was measured by exciting a heat source on the concrete surface and cracked area. As a result of the measurement, it was confirmed that it was possible to observe cracks inside the finishing material with a width of 0.3mm, 0.5mm, and 0.7mm, but it was difficult to determine the cracks due to uneven temperature distribution due to surface peeling and peeling of the wallpaper. Accordingly, as a result of performing data analysis by deriving the amplitude and phase difference of the thermal image data, clear crack measurement was possible for 0.5mm and 0.7mm cracks. Based on this study, we hope to increase the efficiency of field application and analysis through the development of technology using big data-based deep learning in the diagnosis of internal crack damage in finishing materials."
그림을 만지다― 觸覺을 통한 조선시대 그림 감상,2023,"['촉각', '그림 감상', '전시', '정선', '김홍도', '김정희', 'tactile sense', 'touch', 'appreciating painting', 'exhibition', 'Jeong Seon', 'Kim Hongdo', 'Kim Jeonghee']","전근대기 동아시아 그림, 특히 조선시대 그림이 ‘觸覺’의 차원에서 중시된 매체였음을 논하고자, 이 연구는 서구에서 연구된 촉각의 가치 및 전근대기 동아시아 회화 형태가 요구한 촉각적 측면을 먼저 살피고, 조선시대 그림 감상의 기록에서 그림을 ‘만졌다’(撫’, ‘摩挲’, ‘摸’)고 한 감상의 기록을 조사하고 분류하였다. 그 결과, 그림을 만지는 이유는 관계의 매체로서의 감상과 예술작품으로서의 감상이라는 두 유형으로 대별되었다. 그림을 ‘사회적 관계의 매체’로 대하는 유형에서 많은 양을 차지하는 것은 감상자가 화가, 소장자, 혹은 그림 속 인물과 관계를 가지는 경우이다. 이러한 그림의 가치는 예술성에 앞서 관계적 의미로 결정되며, 감상자가 일으키는 비애감의 정도가 매우 깊다. 여기서의 관계란 가족, 벗과 같은 직접 경험의 관계, 사라진 명나라의 인물과 같이 역사 맥락적 관계이기도 하다. 그림의 주제를 학습 경험에 의거한 학문적, 문학적, 도덕적 내용으로 이해하는 것도, 유사한 학습 경험을 가진 지적 공동체에서의 학문적 공감대 속에서 소통의 감동이 이루어진다는 점에서 관계적 유형에 해당된다. 또 다른 유형은 ‘예술적 작품성’을 평가하며 만지는 것이다. 작품의 표현과 묘사에서 실감의 감동과 즐거움을 느끼는 감상, 매우 귀한 작품을 만지며 가졌던 소유의 대리적 즐거움 등이 이에 해당한다. 이러한 두 번째 유형에서는 뛰어난 화가의 우수한 작품을 대상으로 하며 기쁨을 느낀다는 공통점이 드러난다. 이상에서 살핀 바 두 가지 유형의 감상에 나타나는 비애감이나 기쁨은 그림을 만지는 행위로 배가되었다고 기록되어 있다. 이 논의는, 전근대기 그림이 근대적 예술 인식에서 주장하는 ‘視覺’적 대상에 국한되지 않고 풍부한 감각의 차원에 있었음을, 특히 촉각의 차원이 중요하게 작동하였음을 알려준다.","In order to discuss that East Asian painting of pre-modern period, especially of Joseon era, has been appreciated in tactile sense, this study showed valuable cultural properties of touch that has been studied in the West and the tactile forms of the pre-modern paintings in East Asia, and then investigated the cases of tactile appreciation through literary records in the Joseon Dynasty. According to this survey, the reasons for appreciation of touching paintings were largely divided into two types: as communication media and as art works. When dealing with painting as a social communication medium, the viewer has a deep relationship with the artist, the collector or the person drawn in the painting. The value of the painting was determined in the meaning of the viewer’s social relationship. Or, when understanding the subject of painting as academic, literary, and moral contents based on learning, it is impressive to communicate with academic consensus in an intellectual community with similar learning experiences. The other type is to touch paintings as artworks. The viewers expressed delight at the excellent drawing skills of famous artists. In addition, the very precious works were touched with the vicarious pleasure of owning the work. In the two types above, the feeling evoked from appreciation were multiplied through touching the paintings. It can be understood that the appreciation method of premodern East Asian painting was not limited to the ‘visual’ sense under the modern perception, but was in the dimension of a richer sense, such as ‘tactility’."

For the purpose of such rescue operations, it is essential to ascertain the distribution of individuals within the building. Nevertheless, there is a primary dependence on accounts provided by pertinent individuals like building proprietors or security staff, alongside fundamental data encompassing floor dimensions and maximum capacity. Consequently, accurate determination of the number of occupants within the building holds paramount significance in reducing uncertainties at the site and facilitating effective rescue activities during the golden hour. This research introduces a methodology employing computer vision algorithms to count the number of occupants within distinct building locations based on images captured by installed multiple CCTVcameras. The counting methodology consists of three stages: (1) establishing virtual Lines of Interest (LOI) for each camera to construct a multi-camera network environment, (2) detecting and tracking people within the monitoring area using deep learning, and (3) aggregating counts across the multi-camera network. The proposed methodology was validated through experiments conducted in a five-story building with the average accurary of 89.9% and the average MAE of 0.178 and RMSE of 0.339, and the advantages of using multiple cameras for occupant counting were explained. This paper showed the potential of the proposed methodology for more effective and timely disaster management through common surveillance systems by providing prompt occupancy information."

Ancient intellectuals understood the dialectical thinking of philosophy in the Qin Dynasty, and the literary and artistic thoughts in many famous works and the literary theories of the past dynasties even indirectly or directly shaped their aesthetic concepts of calligraphy. The philosophical concepts and philosophical categories in ancient Chinese classics have played a leading role in the construction of contemporary Chinese calligraphy aesthetics. It can be said that the aesthetics of ancient intellectuals is the original category of all art, and current calligraphy scholars should fully absorb and learn from it. Therefore, the construction of the discipline system of Chinese calligraphy aesthetics is particularly important for learning from ancient calligraphy aesthetics. The current aesthetics of calligraphy is different from the powerful scientific cognition system in the West. There are still many problems in the construction of aesthetics of Chinese calligraphy. The accurate construction of aesthetics of calligraphy requires not only a clear understanding, but also a deep understanding of ancient Chinese knowledge systems and literati traditions. Developed under the aesthetic consideration of calligraphy, and based on the integrated humanistic knowledge system, this is the only way to truly establish the current calligraphy aesthetics construction towards discipline and theory. In recent years, Chinese calligraphy scholars tend to interpret Chinese calligraphy art within the framework of Western culture, and are relatively lacking in understanding the depth of aesthetic concepts and artistic conception of Qin Dynasty philosophy, lacking in depth and breadth. This paper focuses on the construction of the discipline of Chinese calligraphy aesthetics, and analyzes the “gain and loss” of the academic tendency of Chinese calligraphy aesthetics, which is of great significance.中国古代士人作为书法审美活动的主体，他们以汉字为媒介，推动着这一独具东方美学特色的书法艺术不断向前发展。古代士人深谙先秦哲学的辩证思维，诸思想名著中的文艺思想和历代文论更是间接或直接的塑造了他们的书法审美观念。中国古代先秦典籍中的哲学观念和哲学范畴更是对当下中国书法美学的建构起到了高屋建瓴的思想引领，可以说先秦士人审美观是一切艺术的元范畴，当下的书法学者应当充分的吸收、借鉴。因此，中国书法美学的学科体系建构对于借鉴古代士人传统下的书法审美观尤为重要。当下书法美学不同于西方强大的科学认知体系，中国书法美学建构仍存在着诸多问题，对当下书法美学的准确建构不仅要有清醒的认知，而且必须在深入了解中国古代知识系统和士人传统的审美观照下开展，并以浑融一体的人文知识系统为主，这才是真正确立当下书法美学建构走向学理化的必经之路。近年来，中国的书法学者倾向于以西方学问的框架诠释中国书法艺术，对于领悟先秦哲学的审美观念深度和意境内涵相对匮乏，缺少深度和广度。本文围绕中国书法美学学科的建设问题，充分分析了中国书法美学学术性倾向的“得失”，具有重要意义。"

In the mid-1980s, a series of student suicides in a competitive educational environment, coupled with deep emotional agitation and questions about what constitutes true ""education,"" coincided with a period of transformation in Korean society, culminating in the formation of the National Education Association in 1989.As we have seen, a series of educational activist theatres emerged in response to the cultural movements of Korea during the Transformation. In the context of the rallying nature of the education democratisation movement and the folk national cultural movement in relation to a series of student suicides, the creative dance version <Happiness is not in Grading Order> (December 1987) was created, and the film of the same name (1989) was created in the context of the public's awareness of the seriousness of educational problems, the audience of the youth audience, and the culture of the urban middle class. In <Sunsae Imyo> (1989), <Last Class> (1989), and <Good Luck Teacher> (1989), the period of transformation from the June 1987 uprising to the formation of the National Teachers' Union in 1989, the agency of teachers as agents who change the reality of education, reflections on the labour conditions of teaching, conflicts and confusions created by the immaturity of the agents encountered in the actual educational field, and alternative reflections and questions about what is the educational field as a place of learning and teaching are embodied. <Dismissal Diary (1992)> captures the temporality of the post-dismissal period in the form of an accusatory drama and in-depth reflection, rather than in the form of a 'transformation period', and <Teacher Kim, What Are You Doing Now (1995)> shows the reality of the school after the aspirations for the possibility of educational reform have faded, while at the same time capturing the hesitation and disillusionment of a time when it is no longer possible to confirm the divergent paths of life after the movement or the meaning of continuing true education.The collective action of the teachers' union movement and the cultural symbols of the dissident folk movement derived from the student movement during this period were judged to be political and disturbing. However, the 'political' that was raised in the various educational movement plays was the questioning and exploration of the modernisation of education in Korea: the content and method of teaching that should be shared in public education, the professional and cultural hierarchy outside of school, individual competence, the nature of play and study, and the process of questioning and reconciling the shares and opinions in the social consensus on a good society and a happy life."

In Kim Su-young’s prose, Kim Soo-young said that he was trying to learn ‘literary theory of Western colonialism.’ The ‘literary theory of Western colonialism’ thought by Kim Soo-young is Heidegger’s ‘Western metaphysics’. Citing Jacques Derrida’s criticism of the blind spots of Heidegger’s ‘Western metaphysics,’ I will try to argue why I think it is ‘Western colonial literary theory.’ Kim Sang-hwan and Kim Yu-jung’s ontological interpretation of Kim Soo-young is judged to be the most remarkable achievement among existing studies.Seeing the desire to discover love in Kim Soo-young’s 〈Variations on Love〉 as a love for citizens and reality, Kim Soo-young wanted harmony between pure poetry and participatory poetry in his later works, and as a methodology, concentric expansion through repetitive rhythm and ‘mental repetition’. The object of love has expanded from self to others, citizens, and society. In the era of the modern climate crisis, the author wants to expand the scope of others from people to people, animals, society, and nature. Kim Soo-young wrote many nature-friendly poems. ‘Son’ in Kim Soo-young’s 〈Variations on Love〉 introduced the form of a letter written with love and sincerity to ‘son’ into the poem, destroying the forms of poetry and prose, and creating a ‘paradigm revolution’ through repetition of rhythm. “The day will come when I will go crazy with love!”, showing the freedom and love of ‘postcolonial literary theory’ and ‘desire for peaceful unification’. Kim Soo-young viewed the methodology of his later works as ‘nothingness (無)’ and talked about the methodology and meaning of ‘meaningless micro-poetry’. ‘Meaningless poetry’ is ‘meaninglessness’ that contains meaning. Heidegger spoke of ‘nothingness’ in the era of nihilism and nihilism, but he thought it lacked otherness, so it was not a true ‘nothingness.’ Real ‘nothingness’ requires otherness as a prerequisite, and Jacques Derrida’s ideas well reveal the perception of those around him and are more appropriate for Kim Soo-young’s poetry. In Kim Soo-young’s poetry, there is a real ‘nothingness’ that thinks of social outcasts.The repeated words in Kim Soo-young’s “By the Green Onion Field” are “old love…” … Look at the green sprouts of the red onion field/ To gain is to lose.” In this poem, ‘old love’ is the poet’s love for citizens, society, and reality. The ‘red green onion field’ is a metonym for the sacrifice of those who shed blood in the revolution. ‘Green Sprout’, like Kim Soo-young’s 〈Grass〉, is a ‘post-colonial literary theory’ and a ‘desire for peaceful unification’ with the vitality of citizens and a paradigm revolution. Citizens gain freedom after the revolution, but before that, sacrifices such as the shedding of blood by citizens are supported. That is why it is expressed, “To gain is to lose.” Kim Soo-young’s love is not just love, but ‘old love.’ Old and deep love for reality and citizens made the sky, the earth, and humans one by using the ‘green onion fields’ of nature and the earth, unifying the universe as one. This is similar to 〈Taegeukdoseol〉 in Kim Sang-hwan’s writing, and shows the harmony of participatory poetry and pure poetry seen in Kim Su-young’s later works and the cosmic principle of ‘nothingness’, using the earth and nature to demonstrate ‘recursion’ through repetitive rhythm. This is meaningful.In Kim Soo-young’s poetic essay 〈Poetry, Spit〉, “〈Content〉 must always be said to the outside world and say, 〈There is not too much freedom.〉 Only then can the 〈form〉 of 〈there is too much freedom〉 be conquered, and only then can a work of art be finally established. 〈Content〉 must always keep saying to the outside world, ‘There is not too much ..."

Kim Jip became a typical scholar by doing filial piety to his parents, commemorating his ancestors, and promoting the harmony of his relatives. Kim Jip's disciples described many aspects of Kim Jip as a Neo-confucian scholar. Throughout his life, Kim Jip lived a life of suppressing greed and preserving the right principles. Kim Jip served his father for more than 40 years with all his heart. Kim Jip was faithful to connecting his father's will and learning as well as thorough filial piety. As a result, a father-son relationship called ""benefit to help each other grow"" (相長之益) was formed, which was not easily reached by other fathers and sons. Kim Jip expanded his filial piety to show deep friendship and family consciousness between brothers and continued to harmonize with relatives. This can be seen from his attitude of the process of family succession. When his brother died without son and he did not have a suitable son, he handed over his brother's first son family succession. In addition, Kim Jip actively carried out ancestral rites and ancestral tomb rituals, emphasizing the sincerity of worshiping his ancestors and efforts to harmonize with his relatives. In addition, he tried to thoroughly manage and preserve ancestral rites and rituals by preserving documents for the management of shrines and ancestral tombs, and managed family temples that managed ancestral tombs. In addition, attention and efforts were made to promote harmony among his relatives through various family projects such as family gatherings and the compilation of family genealogies."
찰스 웨슬리의 회심과 찬송시의 영성,2023,"['Charles Wesley', 'Conversion', 'Hymn', 'Christian Spirituality', 'Methodism.', '찰스 웨슬리', '회심', '찬송시', '영성', '메소디즘']",,"It is urgent for today's churches and its members living in the time of the Post-COVID-19 pandemic to look into their spirituality and take time to reflect on the Spirituality above all. In particular, the mission of bringing souls, especially those who have been alienated from the church and God due to the pandemic, back to Christ is one of the most important tasks for Korean churches. In order to accomplish this, I would like to introduce the conversion experience of Charles Wesley to the modern church and its members. He was one of the main roles for the Methodism-movement. Especially, his conversion on May 21-25, 1738 ignited the birth of Methodism-movement. Nevertheless Charles isn't still getting as much light as expected. In this regard, I would like to shed light on Charles Wesley through a study on his conversion and spirituality.Charles Wesley's conversion was very dynamic, mysterious and gracious. His conversion occurred on Pentecost Sunday, May 21, 1738. But the conversion had begun six months ago. For Charles, the period from November 20, 1737 to May 20, 1738 was a state of purgation or a state of pain and effort. During this period Charles realized the finiteness and imperfection of his own sinfulness and physical weakness. Charles did everything to solve his own problems in both spirit and body. And finally, on Sunday morning, May 21, 1738, Charles experienced a dramatic conversion. But his conversion was not a one-time event. Charles was able to form an experiential spirituality by the love of Christ through a series of events for conversion from the 21st to the 25th of May, and based on this, he has begun to form an experimental and practical spirituality.What we can learn from Charles' conversion is that conversion is not the final destination of spirituality. It is the path to Christian perfection. After his conversion Charles clearly experienced spiritual freedom every day. This did not mean that all of evil temptations were gone. Rather, he remained awake because he was more spiritually sensitive than before. In this meaning, therefore, Charles' conversion and spirituality, although hundreds of years have passed, give deep resonance and challenge to Christians living in the time of the post-pandemic."

With a rapid aging of the population, the trend of suicide among the elderly is expected to accelerate, preventing elderly suicide has been considered an important societal problem. Thus, we aim to investigate various factors that explain suicidal ideation and to develop a predictive model for suicidal ideation in the context of elderly people in South Korea. To this end, this study contributes to addressing the elderly suicide problem. By using seven-year panel data from the Korea Welfare Panel Survey, we extract various potential causal factors for elderly suicidal ideation based on interpersonal theory of suicide and social disorganization theory. Then a panel logit model was employed to assess the impacts of potential factors on suicidal ideation and deep learning and machine learning algorithms were used to develop a predictive model for suicidal ideation of elderly people. The results of our study provide practical implications for preventing elderly suicide by identifying causal factors of suicidal ideation and a high suicidal risk group of the elderly.

Since he died in his thirties, there is little information about his artistic journey. To accurately illuminate Kim Jong-Gi’s musical life, a three-dimensional verification is necessary, involving his family background, lineage, educational process, and relationships with his peers through the network of relationships surrounding him.Kim Jong-Gi came from a musical family. It can be inferred that he originally came from a musical family since his brother’s, and his father’s name is not on any of the genealogy of the Kim clan of Gimhae. His elder brother was also a master musician of the gayageum and the haegeum. At his time, multi-talented musicians mostly came from the musician family. Furthermore, the fact that Kim Jong-Gi’s gayageum teacher, Park Han-Yong, came from a musical family and that Kim Jong-Gi’s in-laws were musicians confirms that Kim also came from a musical family, considering the customs of musicians marrying within musical families. Kim Jong-Gi's original Chinese name is ‘金鍾基’, but he became known as ‘金宗基’ in the media while active in Gyeongseong(now Seoul). Kim Jong-Gi was born in 1905 and passed away in 1935. This can be deduced through his relationships and testimonies from individuals he collaborated with at the time, such as Park Rok-Ju, Im Bang-Wool, Shin Kwae-Dong, and Kim So-Hee. While Kim Jong-Gi’s birthplace is known as Jangsu in Jeolla-do Province, it is highly likely that his family originally came from Chungcheong-do Province, as stated by his nephew, Kim Su-Ak. It is reasonable to consider that he was born in Jeolla-do Province after his ancestors moved from Chungcheong-do Province.Park Han-Yong is considered Kim Jong-Gi's teacher in geomungo sanjo. They have a mentor-disciple relationship within the ‘Gabi’ family. Baek Nak-Jun is considered Kim Jong-Gi’s teacher in geomungo. If Kim Jong-Gi is originally from Chungcheong-do Province, it is natural for him to have learned the geomungo from Baek Nak-Jun, who came from the shaman clan in Chungcheong-do Province. Kim Sam-Tae, Jung Geum-Rye, and Bang Geum-Seon can be mentioned as Kim Jong-Gi’s disciples. Kim Jong-Gi’s gayageum sanjo was properly passed down by Jung Geum-Rye, and it has been continued to the present by Kim In-Je and Kim Jin-Ae.Kim Jong-Gi had a close friendship with Park Rok-Ju, a renowned singer of the time, and he was an active member of the ‘Joseon Vocal Music Research Society’, taking a leading role as a pioneering musician in the music scene in the early 1930s. After Kim Jong-Gi’s passing, the initiative in the gayageum field was carried on by Kim Chang-Jo’s disciples. The friendship between Kim Jong-Gi and Im Bang-Ul was special, and through their musical exchange, Kim Jong-Gi became a motivating force in creating a new style of gayageum sanjo. He formed deep connections with other musicians, such as Oh Tae-Seok and Park Jong-Gi, and expanded his musical world through collaboration with them."

The academic world of Song Bok, professor emeritus of sociology at Yonsei University and a former journalist who enjoyed Chinese studies and had a background in political science, is covered from the perspective of knowledge sociology, which is based on studies that are completely different from the real world he experienced.Born into a family of Chinese scholars, Chinese Studies-friendly environment and home education, college life in Seoul, and experience in the world of thought. The rational thinking based on reality of the military, the experience of magazine <Cheongmaek>, exposure to sociology at the Graduate School of Journalism, studying abroad at the University of Hawaii and experiencing English, comparing Shakespeare and Chinese Old Literature (GomunJinbo), and realizing that he could not help but enjoy Chinese studies, gave him various experiences in sociology. It was a series of coincidental events that led to. In social science, contingency is suitable for explaining long-term pathways where causal relationships are difficult to operate. As a sociologist, Professor Song Bok’s experiences of various events leading up to his life were connected by chance, but within each event was the blood and sweat invested by the human being Song Bok. Chinese studies, English, his career as a journalist, political science, and his way of pursuing studies, which are explained through causal relationships, were the products of his efforts, and each of these events can be treated through a path explanation called coincidence.Song Bok, who entered the journalism industry with experience in sociology and recognition for his writing skills, was still distant from sociology. In the meantime, while he was experiencing the field of journalism, the launch of the magazine, <Cheongmaek> and a series of events that occurred led him to begin the academic world of sociology in earnest. The vortex of modernization and political change in Korean society led Song Bok, who had experience in a variety of academic fields, to start out as a sociologist. The connection with Yonsei University, which he came across by chance, gave him a variety of experiences and although he chose a different path in life than other professors, it was a valuable gift to him, preventing him from falling into a path other than that of a scholar.Professor Song Bok was able to achieve freedom as a scholar at Yonsei University. Because he did not work at a school, he lived as the master of his time, as the master of writing by writing what he wanted without pressure, and as he did not conduct research to raise research funds, he lived free from money. Professor Song Bok was able to conduct research in search of reality without being pressured by social structure, and as a result, he was able to explain Korean society in terms of inequality, class, and organization. This study is a study to find the roots and processes of Song Bok, who has followed a single path of explaining social phenomena through Korean sociology by finding Eastern ideas that form the deep structure of Korean society based on Western academic methodology."

Generative AI, which is developing rapidly, is expected to bring about great changes in the search market, education, and creative fields, and will also be a great turning point in animation production education.The purpose of this study is as follows. First, considering the meaning of the word Animation, which is a video production technique that makes motionless things move, it is natural to apply generative AI that shows high efficiency in the animation production process that requires many processes. Second, the speed of technological development of image-generating AI such as Midjourney, Dall-E, and Stable Diffusion is very fast and powerful, so it is likely to develop into a universal authoring tool that anyone can use easily. is high Third, whether or not to use generative AI can become an important competitive edge in the industry in the future, as Google, Microsoft, and Adobe are actively testing and introducing graphics programs such as Photoshop, Premiere, and After Effects. With the advent of imagegenerating AI, which has a ripple effect enough to redefine the act of creation, it is necessary to understand its operating principle and actively introduce it into the production process even in animation production education. Accordingly, the present situation, which is in the early stages of the emergence of generative AI, is summarized, and the concept and characteristics of image-generating AI are compared and analyzed to help research on animation production education.The research process first explains the principles of generative AI so that users can understand artificial intelligence and generative AI at the user level, discusses the dangers of hallucination and unknown parameters, and then discusses problems that may occur in generative AI at the original level. disappearance, creativity and copyright issues, and creators’ job crisis. As background knowledge for analysis, first, the principle of image-generating AI is explained along with basic deep learning models, and the importance of natural language interface using multimodal is mentioned, and then image-generating AI is analyzed. As a result of the analysis, in the current education environment, problem solving for individual usage costs must be preceded, and Adobe’s Firefly, which is familiar and highly compatible with the program currently being used for education, is recommended, unlike services that are used by accessing a server. . Next, in the prompt education, which is a key method of using generative AI, it was described that it is necessary to study the ability to express imagination in writing, art trends, famous artist’s artwork, camera lens, lighting, and layout. In particular, in the process of collaborating with AI, the process of selecting the created image is important, so it was named “creative selection”. It is hoped that the user-level information on image-generating AI introduced in this study and the contents on how to write prompts will serve as reference materials for preparing animation production training materials using image-generating AI."
AI 기술의 패러다임 변화에 대한 이해와 사회적 문제 고찰,2023,"['AI', '교양교육과 AI', 'ChatGPT', 'Tyny AI', 'Deep Network AI', 'Generative AI', 'AI', 'Liberal Arts Education and AI', 'ChatGPT', 'Tyny AI', 'Deep Network AI', 'Generative AI']","AI 기술에 대한 진보가 급격하게 발전하며 사회 전반에 걸친 대부분의 제품과 서비스, 기술에 적용되고 있다. 기존의 단순한 판단을 넘어 상황 인지, 번역, 의학적 판별, 자율 주행은 물론 음악, 그림, 시를 새로 만들어 낼 수 있는 단계에 이르렀다. ChatGPT는 하나의 혁명으로 인지되며 한 사람의 몫을 감당 할 수 있는 역할을 부여하며, 이를 서비스로 확장하기 위한 노력을 기울이고 있다. 대학의 교양교육은 학생에게 다양한 학문 분야의 기초 지식을 배울 기회를 제공한다. 비 IT 계열의 학생도 AI 기술의 패러다임 변화에 대한 기초를 이해하고 적용할 수 있도록, IT 관련 교양 강의에서 다루어질 필요가 있다. 이를 기반으로 학생들의 주 전공과의 연계 및 융‧복합적인 사고 확장이 가능할 것으로 기대된다. 본 논문에서는 이러한 AI 기술 진보를 큰 카테고리로 구분하여 패러다임 변화를 이해하고자 한다. 또한 향후 AI 기술의 진보에 대한 사회적 이슈를 도출하고 이를 고찰하고자 한다.","Advances in AI technology are rapidly developed and applied to most products, services and technologies across society. It has reached a stage that it can create new music, pictures, and poems as well as situational awareness, translation, medical judgment, and autonomous driving. A ChatGPT is recognized as a revolution, granted a role of human, and efforts are being expanded it into a service. The liberal arts education of universities enables students to learn basic knowledge in various fields of study. The non-IT students also need a basic understanding of the paradigm shift of AI technology. It is necessary to apply it to IT-related lectures for non-IT students in the liberal arts curriculum at the university. It is expected that students will be able to connect with their main major and expand convergent thinking. In this paper, we explain to understand the paradigm shift by classifying these AI technological advances into large categories. In addition, we intend to derive social issues regarding the progress of AI technology in the future and consider them."
Somatosensory ECoG-based brain–machine interface with electrical stimulation on medial forebrain bundle,2023,"['Brain–machine interface', 'Somatosensory cortex', 'Virtual reward', 'Brain plasticity', 'Deep brain stimulation']",,"Brain–machine interface (BMI) provides an alternative route for controlling an external device with one’s intention. For individuals with motor-related disability, the BMI technologies can be used to replace or restore motor functions. Therefore, BMIs for movement restoration generally decode the neural activity from the motor-related brain regions. In this study, however, we designed a BMI system that uses sensory-related neural signals for BMI combined with electrical stimulation for reward. Four-channel electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals were recorded from the whisker-related somatosensory cortex of rats and converted to extract the BMI signals to control the one-dimensional movement of a dot on the screen. At the same time, we used operant conditioning with electrical stimulation on medial forebrain bundle (MFB), which provides a virtual reward to motivate the rat to move the dot towards the desired center region. The BMI task training was performed for 7 days with ECoG recording and MFB stimulation. Animals successfully learned to move the dot location to the desired position using S1BF neural activity. This study successfully demonstrated that it is feasible to utilize the neural signals from the whisker somatosensory cortex for BMI system. In addition, the MFB electrical stimulation is effective for rats to learn the behavioral task for BMI."
