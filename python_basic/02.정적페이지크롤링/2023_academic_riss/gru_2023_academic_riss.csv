Prophet와 GRU을 이용하여 단중기 전력소비량 예측,2023,"['전력소비량예측', 'Power Consumption Forecasting', 'BEMS', 'PROPHET', 'LSTM', 'GRU']","빌딩에너지관리시스템(BEMS: Building Energy Management System)은 생산 및 소비되는 에너지를 효율적으로 관리하는 시스템이다. 그러나 건물 내 전력소비는 물리적인 특성상으로 인해 생산 및 소비가 일정하지 않아 안정적인 전력 공급이 필수적이다. 이에 따라 건물의 안정적인 전력 공급을 위해서는 정확한 건물 내 전력 소비 예측이 중요하다. 최근에는 시계열분석, 통계분석, 인공지능 등 다양한 방법을 이용하여 전력소비예측에 관한 연구가 진행되고 있다. 본 논문은 Prophet 모델의 장점과 단점을 분석하여 장점인 growth, seasonality, holidays를 선택하였고, Prophet 모델의 단점인 데이터의 복잡성과 외부변수(기후 데이터)의 제한성을 해결하기 위하여 GRU을 조합하여 단기(2일) 및 중기(7일, 15일, 30일) 전력소비량 예측 알고리즘을 제안한다. 실험결과, 제안한 방법은 기존 GRU 및 Prophet 모델보다 성능이 우수하였다.","The building energy management system (BEMS), a system designed to efficiently manage energy production and consumption, aims to address the variable nature of power consumption within buildings due to their physical characteristics, necessitating stable power supply. In this context, accurate prediction of building energy consumption becomes crucial for ensuring reliable power delivery. Recent research has explored various approaches, including time series analysis, statistical analysis, and artificial intelligence, to predict power consumption. This paper analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of the Prophet model, choosing to utilize its advantages such as growth, seasonality, and holiday patterns, while also addressing its limitations related to data complexity and external variables like climatic data. To overcome these challenges, the paper proposes an algorithm that combines the Prophet model's strengths with the gated recurrent unit (GRU) to forecast short-term (2 days) and medium-term (7 days, 15 days, 30 days) building energy consumption. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared to conventional GRU and Prophet models."

In addition, most of the cases of impersonation of public institutionsreported to agency were related to vaccination and reward, and many methods were used to trick people intoclicking on fake URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). When detecting them, URL-based detection methods cannotdetect them properly if the information of the URL is hidden, and content-based detection methods are slow anduse a lot of resources.

In this paper, a new method for identifying an alcohol intoxication by combining CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) and GRU(Gated Recurrent Unit) models is proposed. The proposed model effectively captures the complex features in images and their temporal continuity, making it effective in determining alcohol intoxication. In the training phase, data collection and storage, video segmentation and preprocessing, labeling of alcohol consumption status, traing of YOLOv4 model, and utilization of a hybrid CNN-GRU model steps are composed. In the classification phase, user video input reception, video segmentation, image preprocessing and feature extraction, and alcohol intoxication status determination steps are composed. As a result, we have developed a model for alcohol intoxication classification based on CNN, YOLOv4, and GRU, and constructed a system that provides a web environment.

Traffic congestion can be divided into repetitive congestion and non-recurrent congestion. In this paper, we analyze and predict congestion that occurs repeatedly. Many studies are being conducted to predict traffic volume using existing deep learning, but in some studies, one model is trained with data from multiple roads, resulting in lower model performance. In this paper, through data analysis, only the data of one VDS with the highest traffic volume is used to learn through LSTM and GRU models. In the case of the traffic volume prediction model, it was confirmed that the NSE value was 94.25%, showing good performance. Through future research, it is considered that it will be of great help in relieving traffic congestion if it is used as a preliminary study for V2N system design and collected and used in real time."

Therefore, social media platforms, such as Twitter, have become more critical. They are crucial tools for responding to and managing disasters effectively. This study examined the effectiveness of various deep learning models, such as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), gated recurrent units (GRU), and long short-term memory (LSTM) for classifying disaster-related tweets. Twitter data related to different disasters were collected using hashtags. The data were then cleaned, preprocessed, and manually annotated by a team. The annotated data were divided into training, validation, and testing sets. The data were used to train three models based on BERT, GRU, and LSTM for the categorical classification of disaster tweets. Finally, the three models were evaluated and compared using the test data. BERT achieved an accuracy of 96.2%, making it the most effective model. In contrast, the LSTM and GRU models achieved an accuracy of 93.2% and 88.4%, respectively. These findings underscore the potential effectiveness of deep learning models in classifying disaster-related tweets, offering insights that could enhance disaster management strategies, refine social media monitoring processes, bolster public safety, and provide directions for future research."
A New Distributed Log Anomaly Detection Method based on Message Middleware and ATT-GRU,2023,"['Log Anomaly Detection', 'Message Middleware', 'Attention Mechanism', 'Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU)']",,"Logs play an important role in mastering the health of the system, experienced operation and maintenance engineer can judge which part of the system has a problem by checking the logs.

Multiple linear regression and GRU model for the online prediction of catalyst activity and lifetime in counter-current continuous catalytic reforming,2023,"['Counter-current Continuous Catalytic Reforming', 'Reformate Yield', 'Catalyst Activity', 'Catalyst Lifetime Prediction', 'Scheduling and Optimization']",,"In the catalytic reforming process, aromatic yield is a standard for evaluating the production quality of the process, and studies are underway to improve productivity by optimizing the cost and energy. In particular, the activity and lifetime prediction of reforming catalysts can contribute to overall process efficiency improvement, such as product quality, productivity, and predictive maintenance. However, it is difficult to predict real-time catalyst activity and lifetime according to changes in process operation with the existing method that requires experimental data. In this study, a multiple linear regression (MLR) model and GRU model with the real process operating data are proposed for long-term plant operation and optimization in the counter-current continuous catalytic reforming. The MLR-GRU model predicts catalyst performance degradation and lifetime according to operating conditions by defining a new variable, reforming catalyst activity. The proposed model can predict the future reformate yield with an error of less than 1%. As a result of predicting the catalyst lifetime according to various operating temperatures, feed flow patterns, and feed quality, the feed flow rate had the greatest influence on the catalyst lifetime profile. In terms of the amount of produced reformate oil, the case with maximum feed rate is the worst (−25.6%); on the other hand, the case with minimum feed rate is the best (+11.4%). Thus, it is important to establish an appropriate production plan of the produced reformate oil. The model proposed in this study can predict the reformate yield and lifetime, reflecting the degradation of catalyst performance according to the operating profile in real-time, which is expected to improve productivity by production scheduling, optimization, and predictive maintenance."

Transformed data were used as input for three RNN models: long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), which were compared to determine the optimal network for the classification of signals. Because the fractional Fourier transform displayed different characteristics depending on the chosen angle parameter, the optimal angle range for each RNN was first determined. To evaluate network performance, metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were employed.

An Intelligent Fault Diagnosis Method for Imbalanced Nuclear Power Plant Data Based on Generative Adversarial Networks,2023,"['Fault diagnosis', 'Imbalanced data', 'Generative adversarial network', 'Multivariate time series', 'Recurrent neural network']",,"In the fault diagnosis problem, where sample data of fault cases are imbalanced, data generation and expansion are performed based on a generative adversarial network to obtain balanced data for training. Combining a gated recurrent neural network and an autoencoder model, the GRU-BEGAN model for generating multiple time series data is proposed for the intelligent fault diagnosis of imbalanced nuclear power plant data. To guarantee the consistency of the probability distribution between the generated data and real data, the K-L losses are included as a part of the loss function of the generator. At the same time, the potential feature vector of the real data obtained by the discriminator encoder is introduced as a hidden variable in the generator, and the similarity between the generated data and the real data is controlled by introducing the hidden variables according to the probability to make the generated data diverse. For the imbalanced fault dataset of the nuclear power plant thermal–hydraulic systems, the proposed GRU-BEGAN model is used to expand the original data to obtain a balanced state. Then, a 1D-CNN fault diagnosis model is established based on a convolutional neural network. The experimental results show that the fault diagnosis accuracy of the total test data is improved by 1.45% after data expansion, and the fault diagnosis accuracy of the minority sample is improved by 6.8% after data expansion."

Vehicle rollover accidents occur in one of two ways: tripped and untripped rollovers. For detecting tripped rollovers, the traditional rollover index is ineffective; most precise rollover indicators depend on dynamic models that must identify all the parameters for computations. In this study, we focused on exploring a new index for detecting tripped and untripped rollovers using a neural network (NN). Four types of NNs, i.e., FNN, Tanh, long short-term memory, and gated recurrent unit (GRU), were examined to develop models for estimating rollover indices. The results demonstrated that the GRU and large Tanh network are the most suitable NNs for untripped and tripped rollover prediction, respectively. Moreover, the untripped rollover prediction model having a small GRU network could precisely anticipate the trend of the untripped rollover indicators for up to 0.2 s in advance. Moreover, the created tripped rollover anticipation model with a large Tanh network could precisely forecast the trend of the tripped rollover index up to 0.5 s in advance. Based on these results, rollover prediction in future can be advantageous for rollover prevention and warning systems."

Container terminals face increasing competition owing to expanding ships and increasing container throughput. Quay area container cranes are the key equipment for container loading and unloading; however, their level of automation is lower than those of yard cranes and automated guided vehicles (AGVs). Additionally, they have persistent issues such as variations in work speed depending on the operator's skill, potential human error, and the time and cost required for training and education to generate skilled personnel. This study designed a deep learning-based container crane control model to predict the input force values applied to the trolley and hoist to move a container to the target position, when its initial position, target position, and weight are provided. We designed a container crane simulator that emulates a skilled operator handling a container.

Personal Driving Style based ADAS Customization using Machine Learning for Public Driving Safety,2023,"['Autonomous Vehicles', 'ADAS', 'Machine Learning', 'SVM', 'LSTM', 'GRU', 'Public Driving Safety']",,"The development of autonomous driving and Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) technology has grown rapidly in recent years. As most traffic accidents occur due to human error, self-driving vehicles can drastically reduce the number of accidents and crashes that occur on the roads today. Obviously, technical advancements in autonomous driving can lead to improved public driving safety. However, due to the current limitations in technology and lack of public trust in self-driving cars (and drones), the actual use of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is still significantly low. According to prior studies, people’s acceptance of an AV is mainly determined by trust. It is proven that people still feel much more comfortable in personalized ADAS, designed with the way people drive. Based on such needs, a new attempt for a customized ADAS considering each driver’s driving style is proposed in this paper. Each driver’s behavior is divided into two categories: assertive and defensive. In this paper, a novel customized ADAS algorithm with high classification accuracy is designed, which divides each driver based on their driving style. Each driver’s driving data is collected and simulated using CARLA, which is an open-source autonomous driving simulator. In addition, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) machine learning algorithms are used to optimize the ADAS parameters. The proposed scheme results in a high classification accuracy of time series driving data. Furthermore, among the vast amount of CARLA-based feature data extracted from the drivers, distinguishable driving features are collected selectively using Support Vector Machine (SVM) technology by comparing the amount of influence on the classification of the two categories. Therefore, by extracting distinguishable features and eliminating outliers using SVM, the classification accuracy is significantly improved. Based on this classification, the ADAS sensors can be made more sensitive for the case of assertive drivers, enabling more advanced driving safety support. The proposed technology of this paper is especially important because currently, the state-of-the-art level of autonomous driving is at level 3 (based on the SAE International driving automation standards), which requires advanced functions that can assist drivers using ADAS technology."

Existing methods primarily focus on popular emojis related to user emotions in chat platforms. However, on SNS platforms, such as Instagram, emojis are often used to complement or emphasize the content of short uploaded posts rather than conveying emotions. This paper proposes a method for recommending emojis in Korean language posts on SNS platforms by understanding the context of the posts. We apply a hierarchical KoBERT model to capture the context of Korean posts and recommend a diverse range of emojis suitable for the content. We considered 616 emojis from 314 emoji categories for accurately conveying the context of SNS posts. We constructed the real-world dataset by collecting Instagram posts and developed the hierarchical KoBERT model to learn the hierarchical categories of emojis embedded within the texts. Experimental results validate the superior performance of the hierarchical KoBERT model in emoticon recommendation compared to DNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and GRU models."
