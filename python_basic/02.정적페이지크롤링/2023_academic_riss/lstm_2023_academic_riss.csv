Exercise that causes muscle injury appears as a tendency for the low-frequency region of the EMG signal to increase. Based on this, many studies observe that the median frequency of the EMG signal to confirm the degree of muscle fatigue. In addition, it is said that artificial intelligence technology can find patterns in irregular information and learn them to improve signal prediction results. Therefore, this study aims to predict EMG signals using LSTM, one of the marker-less motion analysis data-based deep learning models in an isotonic exercise environment. 5 participants (age: 26±1.73 years, height: 171.4±4.10 cm, weight: 67.2±3.56 kg) participated in the experiment, and the One arm Dumbbell curl was performed to observe the EMG signal change of the upper arm's brachii muscle.

Existing studies performing faultdiagnosis on collaborative robots use static data collected based on the assumed operation of predefined devices. Therefore, the faultdiagnosis model has a limitation of increasing dependency on the learned data patterns.

Nine subjects were recruited, put on the robotic orthosis, and walked uphill, downhill, and level ground five times, respectively. During walking, three inertial sensors were attached to the human limb’s thigh, calf, and foot, and two inertial sensors were attached to the thigh and calf parts of the robotic orthotisis to measure the ankle and knee angles, respectively. The measured joint angles from the robotic orthotisis and the body limb were compared using SPM(Statistic Parameter Mapping) and trained to classify whether the stance phase or swing phase using LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory) classifier. As a result, the differences in the joint angle between the robotic orthotisis and the body limb were observed in the mid-stance and the mid-swing phase during gait. In addition, misclassification was observed during the change of stance phase and swing phase period. In particular, it was found that the number of misclassifications increased as the difference in joint angle between the robotic orthotisis and the body limb increased in the stance phase. Through this, the difference of joint angle between the robotic orthotisis and the body limb, which occurs along the ramp, affects the accuracy of gait phase detection. It is supposed to develop a phase detection and control algorism considering the effect of classification accuracy due to the difference in joint angle according to the slope change."

Rain on a scale that has not been observed in the past may fall, and long-term rainy seasons that have not been recorded may occur. These damages are also concentrated in ASEAN countries, and many people in ASEAN countries are affected, along with frequent occurrences of flooding due to typhoons and torrential rains. In particular, the Bandung region which is located in the Upper Chitarum River basin in Indonesia has topographical characteristics in the form of a basin, making it very vulnerable to flooding. Accordingly, through the Official Development Assistance (ODA), a flood forecasting and warning system was established for the Upper Citarium River basin in 2017 and is currently in operation. Nevertheless, the Upper Citarium River basin is still exposed to the risk of human and property damage in the event of a flood, so efforts to reduce damage through fast and accurate flood forecasting are continuously needed. Therefore, in this study an artificial intelligence-based river flood water level forecasting model for Dayeu Kolot as a target station was developed by using 10-minute hydrological data from 4 rainfall stations and 1 water level station. Using 10-minute hydrological observation data from 6 stations from January 2017 to January 2021, learning, verification, and testing were performed for lead time such as 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 hour and LSTM was applied as an artificial intelligence algorithm. As a result of the study, good results were shown in model fit and error for all lead times, and as a result of reviewing the prediction accuracy according to the learning dataset conditions, it is expected to be used to build an efficient artificial intelligence-based model as it secures prediction accuracy similar to that of using all observation stations even when there are few reference stations."

Solar power generation fluctuates greatly depending on external conditions, and even distribution areas with the same solar radiation do not produce the same electricity. Therefore, it is necessary to reflect other factors besides weather factors in order to improve the accuracy of solar power generation prediction. Therefore, this paper proposes a solar power generation prediction model that adds facility data to weather data used to predict existing solar power generation. The proposed technique builds a dataset based on the module temperature to be used as weather data and facility data and predicts solar power generation with a prediction model using long short-memory (LSTM), which is effective in time series. Finally, performance evaluation is performed through comparison with the model under different conditions. As a result, the model using weather data and facility data achieves better perfomance than the model using only weather data in terms of accuracy."

This paper aims to develop a neural network model that extracts various features from the time and frequency domains in speech data and recognizes emotions through emphasis and pitch changes.

On the Establishment of LSTM-based Predictive Maintenance Platform to Secure The Operational Reliability of ICT/Cold-Chain Unmanned Storage,2023,"['ICT/Cold-Chain Unmanned Storage', 'Predictive Maintenance', 'Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM)', 'System Reliability']",,"Recently, due to the expansion of the logistics industry, demand for logistics automation equipment is increasing. The modern logistics industry is a high-tech industry that combines various technologies. In general, as various technologies are grafted, the complexity of the system increases, and the occurrence rate of defects and failures also increases. As such, it is time for a predictive maintenance model specialized for logistics automation equipment. In this paper, in order to secure the operational reliability of the ICT/Cold-Chain Unmanned Storage, a predictive maintenance system was implemented based on the LSTM model. In this paper, a server for data management, such as collection and monitoring, and an analysis server that notifies the monitoring server through data-based failure and defect analysis are separately distinguished. The predictive maintenance platform presented in this paper works by collecting data and receiving data based on RabbitMQ, loading data in an InMemory method using Redis, and managing snapshot data DB in real time.

CLS 토큰으로 초기화된 양방향 LSTM을 이용한 DPT 기반 단안 깊이 추정 모델의 성능 향상,2023,"['monocular depth estimation', 'vision transformer', 'LSTM', 'transfer learning', 'bi-directional long-short term memory']",,"Monocular depth estimation (MDE) is a computer vision task that estimates the depth value for each pixel in a single monocular RGB image. Given its inherently ill-posed nature, recent studies have focused on data-driven learning-based methods, particularly deep learning techniques based on convolutional neural networks. Building on the success of vision transformers (ViTs), ViT-based models have gained widespread attention for MDE applications. To enhance the performance of MDE, we introduce an intermediate bi-directional long-short term memory (BiLSTM) module, a common component in natural language processing, to learn correlations between each token in a sequence both in the forward and backward directions. Given that transformers naturally encode sequential data, leveraging BiLSTMs to learn the correlations between each token in both directions is a reasonable approach. In addition, we enhance the weight initialization method for BiLSTMs by employing the CLS tokens of transformers, which was originally developed for natural language processing, to make it applicable for processing two-dimensional image data. Subsequently, we developed an MDE model by inserting a BiLSTM module initialized using our method between the encoder and decoder of a DPT-based architecture. Our experiments reveal notable results, with our model achieving 0.913 in δ_1 and 0.097 in AbsRel for the NYU Depth V2 dataset. These results demonstrate a significant improvement over the previous models."

For local prediction, the LSTM model followed the fluctuations in the data and local peak values well. However, the calculation time of the LSTM model is longer than that of the DNN model.Researchers should consider the purpose of the model based on the accuracy-time trade-off relationship between DNN and LSTM models."

PM2.5 Forecast in Korea using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model,2023,['AirKorea · Air pollution · Artificial intelligence · Community multiscale air quality (CMAQ) · Long short-term memory (LSTM) · PM2.5'],,"The National Institute of Environmental Research, under the Ministry of Environment of Korea, provides two-day forecasts,through AirKorea, of the concentration of particulate matter with diameters of≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) in terms of four grades (low,moderate, high, and very high) over 19 districts nationwide. Particulate grades are subjectively designated by human forecastersbased on forecast results from the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) and artificial intelligence (AI) modelsin conjunction with weather patterns. This study evaluates forecasts from the long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithmrelative to those from CMAQ-solely and AirKorea using observations from 2019. The skills of the one-day PM2.5 forecastsover the 19 districts were 39–70% for CMAQ, 72–79% for LSTM, and 73–80% for AirKorea; the AI forecasts showed comparableskills to the human forecasters at AirKorea. The one-day forecast skill levels of high and very high PM2.5 pollutiongrades are 31–98%, 31–74%, and 39–81% for the CMAQ-solely, the LSTM, and the AirKorea forecasts, respectively. Despitegood skills for forecasting the high and very high events, CMAQ-solely forecasts also generate substantially higher falsealarm rates (up to 86%) than the LSTM and AirKorea forecasts (up to 58%). Hence, applying only the LSTM model to theCMAQ forecasts can yield reasonable forecast skill levels comparable to the operational AirKorea forecasts that elaboratelycombine the CMAQ model, AI models, and human forecasters. The present results suggest that applications of appropriateAI models can greatly enhance PM2.5 forecast skills for Korea in a more objective way."
Migration and Energy Aware Network Traffic Prediction Method Based on LSTM in NFV Environment,2023,"['Network Function Virtualization', 'Virtual Network Function Migration', 'Network Traffic Prediction', 'Long Short-Term Memory']",,"The network function virtualization (NFV) uses virtualization technology to separate software from hardware. One of the most important challenges of NFV is the resource management of virtual network functions (VNFs). According to the dynamic nature of NFV, the resource allocation of VNFs must be changed to adapt to the variations of incoming network traffic. However, the significant delay may be happened because of the reallocation of resources. In order to balance the performance between delay and quality of service, this paper firstly made a compromise between VNF migration and energy consumption. Then, the long short-term memory (LSTM) was utilized to forecast network traffic. Also, the asymmetric loss function for LSTM (LO-LSTM) was proposed to increase the predicted value to a certain extent. Finally, an experiment was conducted to evaluate the performance of LO-LSTM. The results demonstrated that the proposed LO-LSTM can not only reduce migration times, but also make the energy consumption increment within an acceptable range."

Multivariate Congestion Prediction using Stacked LSTM Autoencoder based Bidirectional LSTM Model,2023,"['Autoencoder', 'Bidirectional LSTM', 'Convolutional neural network', 'Congestion prediction', 'Spatio-temporal data', 'traffic flow forecasting']",,"In intelligent transportation systems, traffic management is an important task. The accurate forecasting of traffic characteristics like flow, congestion, and density is still active research because of the non-linear nature and uncertainty of the spatiotemporal data. Inclement weather, such as rain and snow, and other special events such as holidays, accidents, and road closures have a significant impact on driving and the average speed of vehicles on the road, which lowers traffic capacity and causes congestion in a widespread manner. This work designs a model for multivariate short-term traffic congestion prediction using SLSTM_AE-BiLSTM. The proposed design consists of a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory(BiLSTM) network to predict traffic flow value and a Convolutional Neural network (CNN) model for detecting the congestion status. This model uses spatial static temporal dynamic data. The stacked Long Short Term Memory Autoencoder (SLSTM AE) is used to encode the weather features into a reduced and more informative feature space. BiLSTM model is used to capture the features from the past and present traffic data simultaneously and also to identify the long-term dependencies. It uses the traffic data and encoded weather data to perform the traffic flow prediction. The CNN model is used to predict the recurring congestion status based on the predicted traffic flow value at a particular urban traffic network. In this work, a publicly available Caltrans PEMS dataset with traffic parameters is used. The proposed model generates the congestion prediction with an accuracy rate of 92.74% which is slightly better when compared with other deep learning models for congestion prediction."

Material designers can examine the stress-strain curve trends based on the combination and composition, but it is difficult to predict using numerical analysis software due to the complex correlation based on chemical properties. To address these limitations in PMC design, this study uses feature engineering methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) and recursive feature elimination with cross validation (RFECV) to find the minimal and optimal set of features necessary for predicting the tensile behavior of PMC.

Commercial buildings usually account for 20% of all energy used, with approximately 30% being wasted. Accurate load forecasting for commercial buildings can help improve operational efficiency. For accurate forecasting load, deep learning models have been used. Furthermore, the selection of input data has become important because the forecasting results can vary depending on which input data is trained. However, although various hybrid models have used historical sequential data as input data using the sliding window approach, they did not consider the hourly correlation between factors and load while selecting input data. In this paper, a hybrid convolutional neural network—long short-term memory network is used in combination with a similar day selection model to overcome these limitations by selecting the data of similar days as input data and by considering the hourly correlation with factors. The proposed method is found to be effective by comparing the performance of the traditional methods using convolutional neural or long short-term memory network."
On The L2 LSTM LM’s Knowledge of Implicit Causality,2023,"['neural language model', 'implicit causality', 'L2 LM', 'probability', 'semantic information', 'pronoun']",,"Recently, neural language models (NLMs) trained on vast amounts of raw text have been shown to acquire abstract linguistic representations. In this study, we tackled the robustness of these abstractions by focusing on discourse information determined by implicit causality verbs. Comparing the observed behaviors from human experiments and L1 NLMs, we evaluated the extent to which discourse structure could be acquired by the L2 NLM. We especially probed whether implicit verb biases could influence the probability of pronouns. We discovered that the L2 Long-Short Term Memory NLM is unable to demonstrate knowledge of implicit causality when resolving reference. In other words, the L2 LM has difficulty encoding semantic information in its abstract representational space. The mismatches in syntactic representations and behavior suggest that the L2 LM passes over the learned abstract categories from the data. Our results further indicate that the observed the L2 LM’s behaviors can contradict learning representations of discourse/semantic information, pointing to limitations of language modeling."

LSTM 모형에 대한 이런 결과는 비록 시퀀스 데이터이더라도  KOSPI 수익률과 같이 백색잡음(white noise)이 포함된 시계열 자료에서는 RNN LSTM의 장점이 발휘되기 어렵다는 사실을 보여준다.","The Machine learning-based studies on the stock market have tended to focus on the efficiency of prediction based on relatively free variable selection from financial theory and optimization models. Such machine learning-based studies may be at odds with the existing financial theory of the stock market. Therefore, this study secured a research basis that conforms to financial theory by conducting a process of testing the randomness of time series data that was neglected in the machine learning analyses. This analysis, also, selected analysis data which consider multicollinearity among variables. Traditional regression analysis using this data was also conducted to establish a foundation for comparing the machine learning results based on the artificial neural network models.Machine learning involved setting up 1, 5, 10-layer MLP models and 1, 5, 10-layer LSTM models with one cell per layer, and the models were also classified based on whether or not an activation function was included for each layer.The training results showed that the MLP model without activation functions did not improve the efficiency level measured by MSE and MAE, even when the number of layers or training times were increased. However, the training of MLP models that include activation functions, ReLU, which can reflect nonlinearity in the learning process, showed a clear improvement in efficiency with an increase in the number of layers, training times, and input data size.In contrast, in the training of LSTM models, an increase in the number of layers and training times did not consistently show improvement in efficiency, and even when there was improvement, the impact was limited. However, it was concluded that an increase in input data size contributed to improved efficiency. Such results for LSTM models demonstrate that even with sequence data, the advantages of RNN LSTM are difficult to manifest in time series data that include white noise process, such as KOSPI return."

In this paper, we discuss supervised learning algorithms to conduct filtering of the noise reviews efficiently, and compare their performance through experiments. About 20,000 reviews collected for tourist attractions in the Ulsan metropolitan city were used for the experiments, and LSTM and BERT, which are known to provide high accuracy in text processing, were adopted for training and testing the reviews. As a result, BERT provided better accuracy than LSTM, where f1-scores of the two algorithms were 90.1% and 95.2%, respectively. On the other hand, in terms of execution time, LSTM was about 5 times faster than BERT. The result shows that, in the noise review filtering, BERT can be used more properly when accuracy is important, whereas LSTM can be used more properly when performance is important or computation resources are insufficient."

The need for investment strategy research on the cryptocurrency market is also emerging. This study aims to conduct an empirical analysis on an investment methodology of cryptocurrency that combines short-term trading strategy and deep learning. Daily price data of the Ethereum was collected through the API of Upbit, the Korean cryptocurrency exchange. The investment performance of the experimental model was analyzed by finding the optimal parameters based on past data. The experimental model is a volatility breakout strategy(VBS), a Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) model, moving average cross strategy and a combined model. VBS is a short-term trading strategy that buys when volatility rises significantly on a daily basis and sells at the closing price of the day. LSTM is suitable for time series data among deep learning models, and the predicted closing price obtained through the prediction model was applied to the simple trading rule. The moving average cross strategy determines whether to buy or sell when the moving average crosses. The combined model is a trading rule made by using derived variables of the VBS and LSTM model using AND/OR for the buy conditions. The result shows that combined model is better investment performance than the single model. This study has academic significance in that it goes beyond simple deep learning-based cryptocurrency price prediction and improves investment performance by combining deep learning and short-term trading strategies, and has practical significance in that it shows the applicability in actual investment."

More specifically, this study adopted support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and artificial neural network (ANN) for machine learning as well as long short-term memory (LSTM) for deep learning. The performance of these (single) algorithms were compared with that of modified ones processed through hyperparameter tuning, ensemble learning (only for machine learning), and multi-layer stacking (i.e., two layers of LSTM units). The daily effluent of wastewater treatment process observed between 2017 and 2022 in the Cheong-Ju National Industrial Complex was used as input to all tested algorithms, which was evaluated with respect to mean squared error. For the model performance evaluation, discharge and biochemical oxygen demand are selected as dependent variables out of nine measured parameters. Results showed that the performance of any machine learning algorithms was superior to their competitor LSTM. This is mainly attributed to a small amount of input data provided to the LSTM algorithm and unstable effluent wastewater characteristics. Meanwhile, hyperparameter tuning improved the performance of all tested algorithms. However, ensemble learning for machine learning and two-layer stacking for LSTM generally resulted in performance degradation as compared to that of single algorithms, regardless of dependent variables. Therefore, this calls for a careful design and evaluation of modified algorithms, specifically for model architecture and performance improvement processes."

In this way, the future trajectories could be predicted successfully even for the abnormal maneuvers because the small-scale dataset for them could train the model independently in the proposed framework.

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has become the most popular modulation technique in underwater acoustic communication due to its high data transmission and robustness over other symmetrical modulation techniques. To maintain the operability of underwater acoustic communication networks, the power consumption of battery-operated transceivers becomes a vital necessity to be minimized. The OFDM technology has a major lack of peak to average power ratio (PAPR) which results in the consumption of more power, creating non-linear distortion and increasing the bit error rate (BER). To overcome this situation, we have contributed our symmetry research into three dimensions. Firstly, we propose a machine learning-based underwater acoustic communication system through long short-term memory neural network (LSTM-NN). Secondly, the proposed LSTM-NN reduces the PAPR and makes the system reliable and efficient, which turns into a better performance of BER. Finally, the simulation and water tank experimental data results are executed which proves that the LSTM-NN is the best solution for mitigating the PAPR with non-linear distortion and complexity in the overall communication system."

When developing spray targeting models, the most used technique is computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Recently, due to the superiority of machine learning in prediction accuracy, the application of machine learning in this field is also receiving constant attention. The purpose of this study is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict spray targeting based on the design parameters of injectors. To achieve this goal, this study firstly used laser sheet beam visualization equipment to obtain many spray cross-sectional images of injectors with different parameters at different injection pressures and measurement planes. The spray images were processed by MATLAB code to get the targeting coordinates of sprays. A total of four models were used for the prediction of spray targeting coordinates, namely ANN, LSTM, Conv1D and Conv1D & LSTM. Features fed into the machine learning model include injector design parameters, injection conditions, and measurement planes. Labels to be output from the model are spray targeting coordinates. In addition, the spray data of 7 injectors were used for model training, and the spray data of the remaining one injector were used for model performance verification. Finally, the prediction performance of the model was evaluated by R2 and RMSE. It is found that the Conv1D&LSTM model has the highest accuracy in predicting the spray targeting coordinates, which can reach 98%. In addition, the prediction bias of the model becomes larger as the distance from the injector tip increases."

And since significant changes in memory space usage are observed together with changes in CPU usage, the problem is solved by using LSTM-Auto Encoder for a collective anomaly in which another feature exhibits an abnormal pattern according to a change in one by comparing two or more features. did In addition, evaluation indicators are set for the performance evaluation of the model presented in this study, and then AI model evaluation is performed."

The model employs Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), including the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model. To address the uncertainty inherent in such predictions, a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) was implemented. The models were trained using a database generated by the Best Estimate Plus Uncertainty (BEPU) methodology; coupling the thermal hydraulics code, RELAP5/SCDAP/MOD3.4 to the statistical tool, DAKOTA, to predict the variation in system response under various operational and phenomenological uncertainties. The RNN models successfully captures the underlying characteristics of the data with reasonable accuracy, and the BNN-LSTM approach offers an additional layer of insight into the level of uncertainty associated with the predictions.The results demonstrate that LSTM outperforms GRU, while the hybrid CNN-LSTM model is computationally the most efficient. This study aims to gain a better understanding of the capabilities and limitations of machine learning models in the context of nuclear safety. By expanding the application of ML models to more severe accident scenarios, where operators are under extreme stress and prone to errors, ML models can provide valuable support and act as expert systems to assist in decision-making while minimizing the chances of human error"

This study aimed to estimate the transpiration amount of tomatoes and find a suitable model using mathematical and deep learning models using minute-by-minute data. Pearson correlation revealed that observed environmental variables significantly correlate with crop transpiration. Inside air temperature and outside radiation positively correlated with transpiration, while humidity showed a negative correlation. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Polynomial Regression model, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Long short-term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models were built and compared their accuracies. All models showed potential in estimating transpiration with R2 values ranging from 0.770 to 0.948 and RMSE of 0.495 mm/min to 1.038 mm/min in the test dataset. Deep learning models outperformed the mathematical models; the GRU demonstrated the best performance in the test data with 0.948 R2 and 0.495 mm/min RMSE.

We compared physics-based energy balance model, first order plus dead-time (FOPDT) model and neural network-based LSTM model for the predictive model of the future temperature of TClab. The model was used to identify future temperature by using the heater’s response and current temperature. The FOPDT and LSTM models have 97–98% of accuracy as the predictive model. Second, the performance of the various control models was compared with a specific temperature profile. The conventional PID control has 1.988 °C/sec errors between the target temperature and the actual temperature in the designated temperature profile. The average error value of the model is lower (1.766 °C/sec errors) due to the predictive model and optimization. The accuracy of MPC is 12.4% higher than that of the PID model. Neural network based deep learning control model is clearly more accurate the PID model. When LSTM model was trained with optimal parameters, The average error between the target temperature and the actual temperature of LSTM model is 1.752 °C/sec.

The deep structure of UDCNN is used to extract the features of text vector classification. The LSTM stores historical information to extract the context dependency of long texts, and word embedding is introduced to convert the text into low-dimensional vectors. Experiments are conducted on the social network platforms Sogou corpus and the University HowNet Chinese corpus.

Online health estimation strategy with transfer learning for operating lithium‑ion batteries,2023,"['Lithium-ion battery', 'State of health', 'Operation conditions', 'Multi-domain transfer learning']",,"Complex power supply operation conditions complicate the degradation process of lithium batteries, which makes the charge–discharge cycle incomplete and the maximum available capacity not easily accessible. Besides, data-driven methods suffer from limited adaptation and possible overfi tting. This paper proposes an online health estimation strategy with transfer learning for estimating the state of health (SOH) of batteries under varying charge–discharge depths and current rates. It aims to alleviate the diffi culty in estimating SOH for operating batteries, and broaden the application range of the training model. The core of this strategy is a two-domain transfer CNN-LSTM model that estimates targets by transferring the battery degradation trends of multiple constant conditions. First, health indicators (HIs) with relatively high correlations and wide application ranges are extracted from the voltage and current data of the daily charge process. Then HI-based source domain selection criteria are designed. Since the battery experiences full and incomplete-discharged cases leading to various aging rates, a two-domain transfer CNN-LSTM model is designed. Each subnet includes a CNN and an LSTM to accomplish feature adaptation and time series forecasting. The weights of the sub-nets are updated online to track the drift of the time series covariates. Finally, the proposed strategy is verifi ed on target batteries with varying cut-off voltages and currents, which demonstrates notable accuracy and reliability."

To overcome these problems, the automobile industry is prioritizing the development of eco-friendly vehicles that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Among these, fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) use hydrogen as a fuel and do not emit exhaust gas and their higher mileage and shorter fuel charging time compared to electric vehicles make them promising next-generation eco-friendly vehicles. However, conventional energy management strategies have not effectively implemented both real-time capability and optimal energy distribution in FCEVs. To address these issues, a powertrain utilizing multi-energy sources is utilized, and a real-time energy control strategy based on long short-term memory (LSTM) is proposed. The training data for LSTM is obtained from the results of dynamic programming, utilizing six-city bus driving cycles, and the Braunschweig city driving cycle is chosen for test simulation. As a result, the LSTM prediction performance is evaluated, resulting in the development of an effective algorithm for real-time energy management of multi-energy sourced FCEVs."

Various studies have been actively conducted to further improve the performance of CNNs, which have been widely used in image classification, among which a representative method is the Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) algorithm. The CRNN algorithm consists of a combination of CNN for image classification and RNNs for recognizing time series elements.

Detecting Abnormal Human Movements Based on Variational Autoencoder,2023,"['Anomalous trajectory detection', 'VAE', 'Bi-LSTM', 'D-score', 'anomaly score.']",,"Anomaly detection in human movements can improve safety in indoor workplaces. In this paper, we design a framework for detecting anomalous trajectories of humans in indoor spaces based on a variational autoencoder (VAE) with Bi-LSTM layers. First, the VAE is trained to capture the latent representation of normal trajectories. Then the abnormality of a new trajectory is checked using the trained VAE. In this step, the anomaly score of the trajectory is determined using the trajectory reconstruction error through the VAE.If the anomaly score exceeds a threshold, the trajectory is detected as an anomaly. To select the anomaly threshold, a new metric called D-score is proposed, which measures the difference between recall and precision. The anomaly threshold is selected according to the minimum value of the D-score on the validation set.

Personal Driving Style based ADAS Customization using Machine Learning for Public Driving Safety,2023,"['Autonomous Vehicles', 'ADAS', 'Machine Learning', 'SVM', 'LSTM', 'GRU', 'Public Driving Safety']",,"The development of autonomous driving and Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) technology has grown rapidly in recent years. As most traffic accidents occur due to human error, self-driving vehicles can drastically reduce the number of accidents and crashes that occur on the roads today. Obviously, technical advancements in autonomous driving can lead to improved public driving safety. However, due to the current limitations in technology and lack of public trust in self-driving cars (and drones), the actual use of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is still significantly low. According to prior studies, people’s acceptance of an AV is mainly determined by trust. It is proven that people still feel much more comfortable in personalized ADAS, designed with the way people drive. Based on such needs, a new attempt for a customized ADAS considering each driver’s driving style is proposed in this paper. Each driver’s behavior is divided into two categories: assertive and defensive. In this paper, a novel customized ADAS algorithm with high classification accuracy is designed, which divides each driver based on their driving style. Each driver’s driving data is collected and simulated using CARLA, which is an open-source autonomous driving simulator. In addition, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) machine learning algorithms are used to optimize the ADAS parameters. The proposed scheme results in a high classification accuracy of time series driving data. Furthermore, among the vast amount of CARLA-based feature data extracted from the drivers, distinguishable driving features are collected selectively using Support Vector Machine (SVM) technology by comparing the amount of influence on the classification of the two categories. Therefore, by extracting distinguishable features and eliminating outliers using SVM, the classification accuracy is significantly improved. Based on this classification, the ADAS sensors can be made more sensitive for the case of assertive drivers, enabling more advanced driving safety support. The proposed technology of this paper is especially important because currently, the state-of-the-art level of autonomous driving is at level 3 (based on the SAE International driving automation standards), which requires advanced functions that can assist drivers using ADAS technology."

The analysis of token frequencies from the ten corpora indicated that the use of positive words has gradually increased. The result demonstrates that the semantic prosody of kay- is shifting from negative toward positive.

This paper proposes an integrated machine-learning strategy for accurately forecasting BDI trends. This study combines the benefits of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) for research on prediction. We collected daily BDI data for over 27 years for model fitting. The research findings indicate that CNN successfully extracts BDI data features. On this basis, LSTM predicts BDI accurately. Model R2 attains 94.7 percent.Our research offers a novel, machine-learning-integrated approach to the field of shipping economic indicators research. In addition, this study provides a foundation for risk management decision-making in the fields of shipping institutions and financial investment."

모바일 로봇을 위한 학습 기반 관성-바퀴 오도메트리,2023,"['IMU', 'Learning', 'Mobile Robot', 'Odometry', 'Wheel']",,"This paper proposes a method of estimating the pose of a mobile robot by using a learning model. When estimating the pose of a mobile robot, wheel encoder and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data are generally utilized. However, depending on the condition of the ground surface, slip occurs due to interaction between the wheel and the floor. In this case, it is hard to predict pose accurately by using only encoder and IMU. Thus, in order to reduce pose error even in such conditions, this paper introduces a pose estimation method based on a learning model using data of the wheel encoder and IMU. As the learning model, long short-term memory (LSTM) network is adopted. The inputs to LSTM are velocity and acceleration data from the wheel encoder and IMU. Outputs from network are corrected linear and angular velocity. Estimated pose is calculated through numerically integrating output velocities. Dataset used as ground truth of learning model is collected in various ground conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that proposed learning model has higher accuracy of pose estimation than extended Kalman filter (EKF) and other learning models using the same data under various ground conditions."

Development of Data-based Hierarchical Learning Model for Predicting Condition Rating of Bridge Members Over Time,2023,"['Bridge maintenance', 'Bridge deterioration', 'Deterioration model', 'Deep learning', 'National bridge inventory']",,"Bridge maintenance strategy is implemented to ensure that effective decisions are made based on the evaluation of the current performance and predicted future conditions of a bridge. The current bridge maintenance system relies on traditional manpower-based methods to determine bridge performance. However, the present techniques employ a material deterioration model that has uncertainty in predicting bridge performance. Moreover, the utilization of collected bridge inspection-related data is insignificant, and related research is lacking. Accordingly, a new type of bridge deterioration model is proposed using state performance data based on bridge inspection. To formulate the deterioration model, bridge condition inspection data accumulated over a long period were utilized. The data have been continuously updated since 1992 by the US Federal Highway Administration and consist of basic information and various influencing factors of bridges. The developed model uses the long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm (a type of recurrent neural network) as well as layer normalization and label smoothing to improve the applicability of fundamental data. For the stable application of data, predicting the model performance for up to 30 years every 2 years is possible. By implementing the many-to-many type of the LSTM algorithm, the predicted probability of each grade derived for each sequence was weighted and averaged with the grade value to derive a continuous state grade result. Thus, the proposed model can express discrete historical degradation indices in continuous form according to the service life. In addition, it enables the prediction of bridge performance using only the fundamental information regarding new and existing bridges. For the effective use of basic data, an optimization model was derived using preprocessing and various regularization techniques. Additionally, a feed-forward deep learning model and stochastic model were developed using the same data. For performance assessment, a regression analysis evaluation method was applied, and comparative analysis was performed using the inspection data of an actual bridge. The use of a time-series model enabled the continuous and stable prediction of bridge performance."

The average AQI was calculated for the various cities in China to understand the annual trends. Furthermore, the air quality index has been predicted for ten major cities across China using five different deep learning techniques, namely, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Bidirectional Gated Recurrent unit (Bi-GRU), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Convolutional Neural Network BiLSTM (CNN-BiLSTM), and Convolutional BiLSTM (Conv1D-BiLSTM).

The number of accidents by drowsy drivers increases every year. So various studies have been performed to solve the issue all over the world. Among others, we focus on the non-contact method. Various vibration signals such as engine, tire, and body vibration are generated in a driving or stationary car. The existing static system is used to measure microscopic vibrations generated from the drivers breathing and heartbeat. It is necessary to design a structure that can cushion vehicle vibration through an advanced signal processing program. In this study, actual vehicles test was conducted to analyze the transmission characteristics of fine vibration through the change of plate structure under sensors. The plate structure is a urethane structure plate that can cushion vehicle vibration while driving. Furthermore, we developed an AI algorithm that classifies whether a subject is in a sleep state or not using a piezoelectric sensor-based BCG signal. This paper shows the AI method is more accurate than the method of classifying sleep states according to analyzing HRV and the ratio of LF/HF with ECG signal. In order to train the system, the subject's biosignals were acquired every 30 s, and 797 data were comparatively analyzed."

A study on light weight of radar-based human activity recognition model using self-attention mechanism,2023,"['Human activity recognition', 'Radar signal processing', 'CNN', 'LSTM', 'Self-attention']",,"Recently, radar-based human activity recognition (HAR) technology has been actively studied in the field of artificial intel-ligence by applying radar datasets to deep learning (DL) models to automatically learn and classification. This is one of the important applications in the field of activity recognition and can be used in various fields, such as exercise tracking, smart homes, self-driving cars, and health status monitoring, by recognizing human daily activity patterns. However, DL models are complex and have significant computational costs and numerous parameters to process and classify high-dimensional radar datasets. Therefore, their implementation on commercial mobile devices is limited by their computational complexity. Therefore, in this study, we propose a lightweight HAR DL model using Self-Attention technology to solve the complexity and computational costs of these DL models. Experimental results demonstrate that this model can maintain its performance while reducing the number of parameters required. In the future, these light-weight models will not only be usable on mobile devices but will also require lower computing power and memory capacity; therefore, they are expected to be used in various fields as time series-based DL models."

Designing container crane control learning model using deep learning,2023,"['Automated container terminal', 'Container crane automation', 'Deep learning', 'LSTM', 'GRU', 'Force prediction']",,"Ports are crucial infrastructure in the global supply chain, and the digitalization and automation of ports have been recently promoted worldwide. Container terminals face increasing competition owing to expanding ships and increasing container throughput. Quay area container cranes are the key equipment for container loading and unloading; however, their level of automation is lower than those of yard cranes and automated guided vehicles (AGVs). Additionally, they have persistent issues such as variations in work speed depending on the operator's skill, potential human error, and the time and cost required for training and education to generate skilled personnel. This study designed a deep learning-based container crane control model to predict the input force values applied to the trolley and hoist to move a container to the target position, when its initial position, target position, and weight are provided. We designed a container crane simulator that emulates a skilled operator handling a container. Data on the trolley and hoist force values were collected for 1,008 cases with different initial positions, target positions, and weights. The recurrent neural network, long short-term memory, and gated recurrent unit (GRU) models were designed to learn the relationship between the target trajectory of the container and the input force values of the trolley and hoist. These values were predicted for three different vessel operation scenarios with different initial positions, target positions, and weights to evaluate the model performance. The GRU container crane control learning model exhibited high prediction accuracy for the input force values of the trolley and hoist. A dynamic simulation confirmed that the container crane could be controlled to move from the initial to the target position."

We consider a transfer learning method for missing data imputation in time series data and test two research hypothesis; the first hypothesis is that the high similarity between two time series, one containing missing values and the other used for transfer learning, improves the imputation performance. Second, a better imputation performance results in a better prediction accuracy. Empirical analysis reveals that the transfer learning with high similarity in two time series improves the imputation performance. As known in the literature, we found a positive correlation between imputation performance and prediction accuracy. However, the correlation between imputation performance and prediction accuracy becomes insignificant when the time series has low volatility and a short length of consecutive missing data. It means that a simple method for missing data imputation is preferred to an expensive but effective method such as transfer learning if the time series is highly stable and predictable."

Detecting objects from a high-speed video that captures fragments just to penetrate a target plate in arena test, vision-based fragmentation detection system acquires fragment velocities and fragmentation distribution. Because only the first penetration data must be obtained to determine the velocity, in this study, the bounding box filter-based detector was used to remove the consecutive duplicate detection result. However, the bounding box filter has an additional dummy area surrounding the fragment area; if new detection occurs in this dummy area, it gets removed by the bounding box filter. This decreases the data acquisition rate and hinders a tester from obtaining sufficient fragmentation data for analyzing the warhead effect. In this paper, a pixel-level filter was proposed based on convolutional long short-term memory (convLSTM); the proposed filter utilizes a spatial association loss function for filtering out duplicate results. Owing to the spatial association loss function, which yields a strong correlation between successive frames, the convLSTM-based filter can generate pixel-level filter masks and remove duplicate results effectively. The experimental results demonstrated the superior performance of the filter."

As it is difficult to analyze the correlation between the deep learning and test data from actual road cars because of the complex environment, an experimental single-cylinder diesel engine is used in this study. The intake air temperature is varied from 0 °C to 100 °C, and the injection timing is varied for nitrogen oxide measurement. Consequently, nitrogen oxide is successfully predicted with a high correlation R2 of 0.994 using minimal engine data."

The proposed approach employs a hybrid estimation logic that integrates wheel speed sensors and an inertial measurement unit sensor to estimate longitudinal velocity and then utilizes the estimated longitudinal velocity to estimate the lateral velocity.

Vehicle rollover accidents occur in one of two ways: tripped and untripped rollovers. For detecting tripped rollovers, the traditional rollover index is ineffective; most precise rollover indicators depend on dynamic models that must identify all the parameters for computations. In this study, we focused on exploring a new index for detecting tripped and untripped rollovers using a neural network (NN). Four types of NNs, i.e., FNN, Tanh, long short-term memory, and gated recurrent unit (GRU), were examined to develop models for estimating rollover indices. The results demonstrated that the GRU and large Tanh network are the most suitable NNs for untripped and tripped rollover prediction, respectively. Moreover, the untripped rollover prediction model having a small GRU network could precisely anticipate the trend of the untripped rollover indicators for up to 0.2 s in advance. Moreover, the created tripped rollover anticipation model with a large Tanh network could precisely forecast the trend of the tripped rollover index up to 0.5 s in advance. Based on these results, rollover prediction in future can be advantageous for rollover prevention and warning systems."

The primary objective involves evaluating the predictability of four prominent cryptocurrencies – Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and EOS – and scrutinizing the efficacy of trading strategies developed based on the prediction model. To identify the most effective prediction model for each cryptocurrency annually, we employed three methodologies – AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Prophet – representing traditional statistics and artificial intelligence. These methods were applied across diverse periods and time intervals. The result suggested that Prophet trained on the previous 28 days' price history at 15-minute intervals generally yielded the highest performance. The results were validated through a random selection of 100 days (20 target dates per year) spanning from January 1st, 2018, to December 31st, 2022. The trading strategies were formulated based on the optimal-performing prediction model, grounded in the simple principle of assigning greater weight to more predictable assets. When the forecasting model indicates an upward trend, it is recommended to acquire the cryptocurrency with the investment amount determined by its performance. Experimental results consistently demon- strated that the proposed trading strategy yields higher returns compared to an equal portfolio employing a buy-and-hold strategy. The cryptocurrency trading model introduced in this paper carries two significant implications. Firstly, it facilitates the evolution of cryptocurrencies from speculative assets to investment instruments. Secondly, it plays a crucial role in advancing deep learn- ing-based investment strategies by providing sound evidence for portfolio allocation.

Method: The prediction model was developed using a long short-term memory (LSTM) learning algorithm based on data obtained from a living lab.The indoor CO2 concentration after 5 minutes was predicted through the data of the past 1 hour, and the prediction accuracy was evaluated with the test data. The adaptive ventilation control algorithm, which incorporates the prediction model, was then applied to the living lab for experiments to evaluate its real-time prediction accuracy, adaptability, and control performance. Result: As a result of the performance evaluation of the predictive model, the coefficient of variation of the root mean squared error (CVRMSE) was 1.78% and the R2 was 0.97. The adaptability evaluation over four days presented an improvement in CVRMSE from 1.78% to 1.13%, which is approximately 36.52% improvement from the initial performance. During the experiment with the adaptive ventilation control algorithm, the accuracy decreased slightly with a CVRMSE of 2.90% and R2 of 0.98, likely due to frequent ventilation control leading to large data variations.

Our objective was to explore the synergistic effects of coupling EEG and BSs, and determine whether the combination of EEG+BS improves the classification accuracy of emotional states compared to using EEG alone or combining EEG with pseudo-random signals (PS) generated arbitrarily by random generators. Employing four feature extraction methods, we examined four combinations: EEG alone, EG+BS, EEG+BS+PS, and EEG+PS, utilizing data from two widely-used open datasets.Emotional states (task versus rest states) were classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classifiers.

Among these, melon is a fruit loved by many consumers around the world, and predictions of its production and quality have great significance in the agricultural field. In particular, accurately predicting melon growth is an important factor in increasing agricultural economics and productivity. The purpose of this study is to utilize various machine learning techniques to accurately predict melon growth. The study was conducted based on melon growth and greenhouse environment data provided by the Jeollanam-do Agricultural Research and Extension Services. Initial data was collected in minutes, which were preprocessed and converted to daily averages. Additionally, because growth data were not measured at regular intervals, linear interpolation was used to fill in missing values. After completing data preprocessing and feature selection, learning was conducted using Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, and GRU among several machine learning models. The performance of each model was evaluated by MSE and R² values. As a result, the random forest model showed the best performance. The brute-force method was used to select the optimal parameters for this model, and the MSE value of the random forest model using the optimal parameters derived through this was 2.33, showing high prediction accuracy.

Development of a Framework for Improvement of Sensor Data Quality from Weather Buoys,2023,"['Weather Buoy', 'Data Quality Management', 'Machine Learning', 'Data Fault Detection', 'Data Interpolation']",,"In this study, we focus on the improvement of data quality transmitted from a weather buoy that guides a route of ships. The buoy has an Internet-of-Thing (IoT) including sensors to collect meteorological data and the buoy’s status, and it also has a wireless communication device to send them to the central database in a ground control center and ships nearby. The time interval of data collected by the sensor is irregular, and fault data is often detected. Therefore, this study provides a framework to improve data quality using machine learning models. The normal data pattern is trained by machine learning models, and the trained models detect the fault data from the collected data set of the sensor and adjust them. For determining fault data, interquartile range (IQR) removes the value outside the outlier, and an NGBoost algorithm removes the data above the upper bound and below the lower bound. The removed data is interpolated using NGBoost or long-short term memory (LSTM) algorithm. The performance of the suggested process is evaluated by actual weather buoy data from Korea to improve the quality of ‘AIR_TEMPERATURE’ data by using other data from the same buoy.

This method uses an electromagnetic simulator for the target classification of moving objects and a time-series network with excellent classification performance. The DRCS method yields measurements based on theoretical calculations after the generation of the static RCS. To propose a reliable, time-series network with excellent classification performance, we consider two cases. The first uses only a ballistic trajectory, and the second uses a maneuver and ballistic trajectory. In addition, to compensate for the disadvantage of the RCS, which is vulnerable to noise, we simulated a noisy situation. We confirmed that the classification performance was lower in the first compared with the second case. However, a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) yielded the best classification performances in both cases, even in noisy conditions. Furthermore, we verified that the performance of LSTM was significantly improved compared with that of the gated recurrent unit when the bidirectional theory was applied. Hence, we suggest the use of an optimized BiLSTM as a DRCS classification network."

Compared with the traditionalclustering method, the improved method has more reliable results, and reduces the operation time by 57.9%. Representative monitoring sensors are selected from each cluster to predict based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The prediction results well agree with the measured value and the prediction accuracy is reaching to 99.3%. Compared with other sensor selection ways, the data of representative sensors exhibits good representativenessand effectiveness.

In the past, administrators directly checked posts and comments, then deleted and blocked them, but as the number of community users increased, they reached a level that managers could not continue to monitor. Initially, word filtering techniques were used to prevent malicious writing from being posted in a form that could not post or comment if a specific word was included, but they avoided filtering in a bypassed form, such as using similar words. As a way to solve this problem, deep learning was used to monitor posts posted by users in real-time, but recently, the community uses words that can only be understood by the community or from a human perspective, not from a general Korean word. There are various types and forms of characters, making it difficult to learn everything in the artificial intelligence model. Therefore, in this paper, we proposes a preprocessing technique in which each character of a sentence is imaged using a CNN model that learns the consonants, vowel and spacing images of Korean word and converts characters that can only be understood from a human perspective into characters predicted by the CNN model. As a result of the experiment, it was confirmed that the performance of the LSTM, BiLSTM and CNN-BiLSTM models increased by 3.2%, 3.3%, and 4.88%, respectively, through the proposed preprocessing technique."

At present, the research of time series recognition based on deep learning is especially important for data monitoring. Deep learning algorithms require a large amount of data for training. However, abnormal sample is a small sample in time series, which means the number of abnormal time series can seriously affect the accuracy of recognition algorithm because of class imbalance. In order to increase the number of abnormal sample, a data augmentation method called GANBATS (GAN-based Bi-LSTM and Attention for Time Series) is proposed. In GANBATS, Bi-LSTM is introduced to extract the timing features and then transfer features to the generator network of GANBATS.GANBATS also modifies the discriminator network by adding an attention mechanism to achieve global attention for time series. At the end of discriminator, GANBATS is adding averagepooling layer, which merges temporal features to boost the operational efficiency. In this paper, four time series datasets and five data augmentation algorithms are used for comparison experiments. The generated data are measured by PRD(Percent Root Mean Square Difference) and DTW(Dynamic Time Warping). The experimental results show that GANBATS reduces up to 26.22 in PRD metric and 9.45 in DTW metric. In addition, this paper uses different algorithms to reconstruct the datasets and compare them by classification accuracy.
