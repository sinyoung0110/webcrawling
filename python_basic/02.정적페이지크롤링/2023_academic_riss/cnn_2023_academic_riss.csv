This work notes that the magnitude of the final output layer value of CNN applied to a particularimage implies the likelihood that the image can be classified into a particular category. To explore the morphological similarity or thepossibility of determining the existence of a style, the following process was performed. This was demonstrated through analysis of CNNstructures and empirical experiments that can evaluate the presence and strength of styles by the magnitude and deviation of the final outputvalues. A classifier model that distinguishes certain architect's works from those of other architects was created. The classifier model wasapplied to the work of a specific architect to obtain the final output value for each work. The possibility of style evaluation using CNN bycomparing two architects who are often evaluated as strong in style and those who are not was confirmed. In this study, Frank Gehry, whois evaluated as strong in style, and MVRDV, which is evaluated as weak in style were compared. In the case of Frank Gehry, it wasconfirmed that the magnitude of the final output layer of the CNN model was larger and the deviation was smaller than those of theMVRDV. Accordingly, it was proved that it is possible to evaluate the existence and strength of a style using the final output layer value ofthe CNN model."

This paper proposes a method to reduce the computation complexity of the deep learning-based bearing faults diagnosis. The acoustic emission signals obtained from the working bearings are converted into spectrogram images, and CNN models are then applied to monitor the bearings' status. The mechanical facilities adopted in real industrial sites have difficulty using expensive processing devices, such as high-performance GPUs. Therefore, a bearing fault diagnosis method for embedded systems is necessary. The proposed method consists of two phases: an initial fault diagnosis phase that classifies normal/abnormal states and a fault-type classification phase determining the defect type for abnormal states.

Usually, the excavation amount is computed by the excavator’s motion equations with sensing data. But these motion equations have computing errors that are induced by assumptions to the linear systems and identification of the equation’s parameters. To reduce computing errors, some commercial weighing system incorporates particular motion into the excavation process. This study introduces a linear regression model on an artificial neural network that has fewer predicted errors and doesn’t need a particular pose during an excavation. Time serial data were gathered from a 30tons excavator’s loading test. Then these data were preprocessed to be adjusted by MPL (Multi Layer Perceptron) or CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) based linear regression models. Each model was trained by changing hyperparameter such as layer or node numbers, drop-out rate, and kernel size. Finally ID-CNN-based linear regression model was selected."

Therefore, ground roll suppression is a crucial step in seismic data processing. Several techniques, such as f-k filtering and curvelet transform, have been developed to suppress the ground roll. However, the existing methods still require improvements in suppression performance and efficiency. Various studies on the suppression of ground roll in seismic data have recently been conducted using deep learning methods developed for image processing. In this paper, we introduce three models (DnCNN (De-noiseCNN), pix2pix, and CycleGAN), based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), for ground roll suppression and explain them in detail through numerical examples. Common shot gathers from the same field were divided into training and test datasets to compare the algorithms. We trained the models using the training data and evaluated their performances using the test data. When training these models with field data, ground roll removed data are required; therefore, the ground roll is suppressed by f-k filtering and used as the ground-truth data. To evaluate the performance of the deep learning models and compare the training results, we utilized quantitative indicators such as the correlation coefficient and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) based on the similarity to the ground-truth data. The DnCNN model exhibited the best performance, and we confirmed that other models could also be applied to suppress the ground roll."

When irregular patterns have important meanings, such as changes in water quality due to heavy rain or changes in public transportation usage due to holidays, predicting the irregular pattern accurately is important.Generally, deep learning-based time series data prediction method use target variables. However, when only target variables are applied for model training, irregular patterns are hard to predict accurately compared to periodical patterns. In this paper, we propose an irregular trend prediction technique using only potential factors instead of target variables. We showed that irregularities could be detected relatively well when only potential factors were applied to the model training process than when target variables were directly applied. The main contribution of this paper is that we can effectively predict the irregular pattern of a target variable using only potential factors, unlike the traditional time series prediction technique using a target variable."

CNNs have improved on the issues of rapid increase in calculation amount and low object classification  rates, which are associated with a conventional multi-layered fully-connected neural network (FNN). However, because of the rapid development of IT devices, the maximum resolution of images captured by current smartphone and tablet cameras has reached 108 million pixels (MP). Specifically, a traditional CNN algorithm requires a significant cost and time to learn and process simple, high-resolution images. Therefore, this study proposes an improved CNN algorithm for implementing an object classification learning model for simple, high-resolution images. The proposed method alters the adjacency matrix value of the pooling layer's max pooling operation for the CNN algorithm to reduce the high-resolution image learning model's creation time. This study implemented a learning model capable of processing 4, 8, and 12 MP high-resolution images for each altered matrix value. The performance evaluation result showed that the creation time of the learning model implemented with the proposed algorithm decreased by 36.26% for 12 MP images.

To further explore this, an artificial intelligence-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was constructed using Gram staining pattern data of intestinal microbes, and its usability was confirmed. In order to investigate the effect of intestinal inflammation on individual health, silkworm moth larvae were fed Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS) along with mulberry leaves, and the concentration of DSS was varied. The experimental group exhibited a low distribution ratio of Proteobacteria at the Phylum level, while the control group had a high distribution ratio. The opposite trend was observed in Firmicutes, which was confirmed by changes in the Gram staining pattern at the sub-classification stage. The experimental group had a lower species diversity index compared to the control group, suggesting a significant effect of the DSS solution treatment on individual health. As a result, cocoon formation occurred more rapidly in the experimental group, and the rate of molting increased with weight gain. The CNN algorithm model was developed using big data on Gram staining patterns of intestinal microbes from both the experimental and control groups. Verification using the validation group demonstrated high accuracy. These findings suggest that the health status of silkworm larvae can be predicted through intestinal microbes using the CNN algorithm model, provided that pre-processing procedures such as Gram staining are further elaborated in future studies."

Various techniques are used to improve the accuracy of product recommendation in existing e-commerce. Among them, there are chronic problems that use RNN, a multi classification-based product recommendation model. RNN is a deep learning model suitable for time series classification tasks, but it suffers from issues such as gradient vanishing and gradient exploding. To Compensate for these issues, CNN models are often used to effectively detect local patterns through kernels. In this study, we compare the performance of recommendation models based on an architecture that generates product recommendation models by training CNN models with time series data through three different imaging encodings: GAF, MTF and RP. In our experiments, we split the 540,000 published transaction dataset into train and test. The splitted data is constructed as time series data and zero-padded to equalize the size of the model’s input image. We train AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet50, and MobileNet models on images generated by the three imaging algorithms and compare their product recommendation accuracy with the performance of existing RNN recommendation models. We can see that the CNN models perform better than the LSTM. When imaged with the GAF algorithm and trained on the MobileNet model, the highest recommendation accuracy was achieved, and the learning time was also shortened, improving efficiency.

In this study, we aimed to experimentally evaluate the temperature distributions in abnormal areas of subgrade materials using infrared cameras and analyze the data with machine learning techniques. The experimental site was configured as a cubic shape measuring 50 cm in width, length, and depth, with abnormal areas designated for water and air. Concrete blocks covered the upper part of the site to simulate the pavement layer. Temperature distribution was monitored over 23 h, from 4 PM to 3 PM the following day, resulting in image data and numerical temperature values extracted from the middle of the abnormal area. The temperature difference between the maximum and minimum values measured 34.8°C for water, 34.2°C for air, and 28.6°C for the original subgrade. To classify conditions in the measured images, we employed the image analysis method of a convolutional neural network (CNN), utilizing ResNet-101 and SqueezeNet networks. The classification accuracies of ResNet-101 for water, air, and the original subgrade were 70%, 50%, and 80%, respectively. SqueezeNet achieved classification accuracies of 60% for water, 30% for air, and 70% for the original subgrade.

Subsequently, leveraging three-dimensional geometric data, we estimate the object's pose by determining its plane. To validate the proposed algorithm, we constructed two environments consisting of objects with different sizes and thicknesses.

However, research on emotional speech denoising has received comparably less attention. Furthermore, limited data are available for such research using Korean emotional speech. This study examined Korean emotional speech recognition in noisy environments using a denoising convolutional neural network (DnCNN) which has primarily been used to detect defects on semiconductor wafers. The DnCNN performed better at classifying emotional categories than the CNN regardless of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. This is the first study to provide evidence of the effectiveness of DnCNN in speech emotion recognition in noisy conditions at different levels of SNRs. In addition, the experimental results suggest the possibility of extending the applicability of DnCNN in the speech domain."

In this work, an image-driven approach with the aid of a convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to predict the remaining time of initially loaded pebbles and the time interval of paired flow images of the pebble bed. Two types of strategies are put forward: one is adding FC layers to the classic classification CNN models and using regression training, and the other is CNNbased deep expectation (DEX) by regarding the time prediction as a deep classification task followed by softmax expected value refinements. The current dataset is obtained from the discrete element method (DEM) simulations. Results show that the CNN-aided models generally make satisfactory predictions on the remaining time with the determination coefficient larger than 0.99. Among these models, the VGG19þDEX performs the best and its CumScore (proportion of test set with prediction error within 0.5s) can reach 0.939. Besides, the remaining time of additional test sets and new cases can also be well predicted, indicating good generalization ability of the model. In the task of predicting the time interval of image pairs, the VGG19þDEX model has also generated satisfactory results. Particularly, the trained model, with promising generalization ability, has demonstrated great potential in accurately and instantaneously predicting the traits of interest, without the need for additional computational intensive DEM simulations.

A high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission network based on voltage source converters (VSC) is an inexpensive solution for long-distance large power transmission that is suitable to link OWF to an alternating current network. In VSC based multi-terminal HVDC systems, DC fault protection is a considerable difficult. To increase the reliability of system protection, fault detection, classification, and location identifications are essential. This keeps electrical systems functioning properly continuously and reduce economic losses, but it might be difficult. To overcome these challenges, this study proposed a computational efficient integrated convolutional neural network–support vector machine (CNN–SVM) approach model while preserving the accuracy. In this paper, the Hilbert–Huang transform (HHT) is used to extracts a feature from current signals. Next, the proposed SVM–CNN algorithm detects, classifies, and computes the fault's location in multi-terminal VSC-based HVDC systems within 2 ms. The simulations were performed using the MATLAB R2019b software. To improve the reliability of system protection, the performance evaluation of the proposed CNN–SVM model includes a comparison with prior-art techniques such as SVM, ANN, and RNN. The simulation results demonstrate that this proposed strategy can identify, classify and locate the VSC–HVDC transmission system DC faults in multiple fault circumstances with high speed and accuracy. The experimental findings reveal that the proposed approach achieves a better fault classification accuracy range of 99.87% within 2 ms.

A corpus-assisted discourse analysis was conducted on news reports about K-pop from 2005 to 2021, focusing on two major global news outlets: BBC and CNN. The study uncovers key agendas and dominant patterns in the portrayal of K-pop by these news sources. The findings indicate that K-pop was presented as a 'cultural commodity,' strategically crafted and promoted by the South Korean government, which utilized the country's advanced technology to enhance its export potential and national image. Furthermore, the analysis reveals a tendency towards conflict-centric narratives in the global news discourse about K-pop, addressing a variety of issues. While BBC news tended to emphasize disputes, highlighting the reactions of the Chinese public on Weibo to controversial incidents involving K-pop stars and South Korea's military advancements, CNN's discourse centered on K-pop fans as socio-political agents, engaging in significant events such as Trump's rallies and the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States. Drawing on these insights, this article critically assesses the role and impact of global news media in constructing the narrative of 'non-Western' popular culture."

To overcome this problem, we introduce a CNN-based architecture for real-time black ice detection with an encoder-decoder network, specifically designed for real-time black ice detection using thermal images. To train the network, we establish a specialized experimental platform to capture thermal images of various black ice formations on diverse road surfaces, including cement and asphalt. This enables us to curate a comprehensive dataset of thermal road black ice images for a training and evaluation purpose. Additionally, in order to enhance the accuracy of black ice detection, we propose a multi-scale dilation convolution feature fusion (MsDC-FF) technique. This proposed technique dynamically adjusts the dilation ratios based on the input image's resolution, improving the network's ability to capture fine-grained details. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed network model compared to conventional image segmentation models. Our model achieved an mIoU of 95.93%, while LinkNet achieved an mIoU of 95.39%. Therefore, it is concluded that the proposed model in this paper could offer a promising solution for real-time black ice detection, thereby enhancing road safety during winter conditions."
Improved fast neutron detection using CNN-based pulse shape discrimination,2023,"['Fast neutron detection', 'Pulse-shape discrimination', 'Organic scintillator', 'Energy dependency', 'Charge comparison method', 'Convolution neural network']",,"The importance of fast neutron detection for nuclear safeguards purposes has increased due to its potential advantages such as reasonable cost and higher precision for larger sample masses of nuclear materials. Pulseshape discrimination (PSD) is inevitably used to discriminate neutron- and gamma-ray- induced signals from organic scintillators of very high gamma sensitivity. The light output (LO) threshold corresponding to several MeV of recoiled proton energy could be necessary to achieve fine PSD performance. However, this leads to neutron count losses and possible distortion of results obtained by neutron multiplicity counting (NMC)-based nuclear material accountancy (NMA). Moreover, conventional PSD techniques are not effective for counting of neutrons in a high-gamma-ray environment, even under a sufficiently high LO threshold. In the present work, PSD performance (figure-of-merit, FOM) according to LO bands was confirmed using a conventional charge comparison method (CCM) and compared with results obtained by convolution neural network (CNN)-based PSD algorithms. Also, it was attempted, for the first time ever, to reject fake neutron signals from distorted PSD regions where neutron-induced signals are normally detected. The overall results indicated that higher neutron detection efficiency with better accuracy could be achieved via CNN-based PSD algorithms."

Experimental results of a real-time black ice detection platform show the better performance of our proposed network model compared to conventional image segmentation models. Our proposed platform have achieved real-time segmentation of road black ice areas by deploying a road black ice area segmentation network on the edge device Jetson Nano devices. This approach in parallel using multi-scale dilated convolutions with different dilation rates had faster segmentation speeds due to its smaller model parameters. The proposed MsCD-FF Net(2) model had the fastest segmentation speed at 5.53 frame per second (FPS). Thereby encouraging safe driving for motorists and providing decision support for road surface management in the road traffic monitoring department."
CNN-based fault classification considered fault location of vibration signals,2023,['· Condition diagnosis · Convolutional neural network · RGB image · Classification · Sensor location recognition · Automated diagnosis'],,"Recently, with the development of the 4th industrial technology such as big data, cloud computing, and IoT, technologies that automatically perform specific tasks without human intervention are being applied in many industrial sites. In the case of rotating equipment diagnosis, features are extracted based on the shape and statistical information of the time and frequency signals of the vibration data for each location, and the acquired data is classified as normal or defective by learning it. However, since this method used the shape and statistical information of the vibration signals, the physical meaning is blurred and the information is not meaningful for actual diagnosis, resulting in inconsistent learning models even in the same facility.In this study, the possibility of classifying normal and fault condition were confirmed by generating images considering the fault component and sensor location of the vibration signal and applying to CNN-based deep learning technology. As a method of performing image processing, STFT is performed on the acquired vibration signal data for each position to generate an image.In addition, converting each sensor position attached to red, green, and blue to express location information, resynthesis was performed to configure learning data and create a classification model. In order to verify this method, verification was performed based on the data acquired for the gearbox system to confirm the possibility of classifying the fault condition."

It is designed to solve the problem that the diversity of samples generated by the original SMOTE model is limited, as well as the deep learning model is limited by the size of training samples and processing speed. Firstly, a few bearing fault data are clustered by G to achieve cluster division. Secondly, according to the cluster density distribution function designed in this paper, the weights of different clusters and sample weights to achieve intra-class balance are determined and data quality is improved. Then, to take full advantage of the limited fault data, based on the sensitivity of the support vector machine (SVM) to imbalanced data, the enhanced boundary is established between generated data and the SVM classifier under different penalty factor (PF) values. According to the accuracy, the optimal PF is determined, and fault datasets satisfying diversity are obtained. To improve the classification accuracy, a convolutional neural network with an attention mechanism is built. Finally, analysis using two practical cases shows the effectiveness of the proposed method."

The Mask R-CNN uses interpolation to adjust the image size, and the input differs depending on the interpolation method. Therefore, in this study, the performance change of Mask R-CNN was compared when various interpolation methods were applied to the transform layer to improve the performance of Mask R-CNN.

Risk assessment of aviation DC series arc based on reconstructed CBAM‑CNN,2023,"['Risk assessment', 'Feature evaluation function', 'Reconstructed CBAM-CNN', 'Sustained arc', 'Un-sustained arc']",,"The hazards of sustained arc and un-sustained arc are different. However, during the stage of arc development, there is a lack of effective methods to identify them, which is not conducive to the timely accurate assessment of arc risk. Therefore, this paper proposes a risk assessment method for aviation DC series arc based on a reconstructed CBAM-CNN. First, in the process of generating the feature set, a feature evaluation function is defined to screen the features. Then the existing convolution block attention module (CBAM) is improved by adding a reshaped layer and redefining spatial attention, which results in the reconstructed CBAM-CNN. Finally, the reconstructed CBAM-CNN takes the feature set as its input and output arc risk assessment results on the basis of enhancing the attention of important features. The validity of the reconstructed CBAM-CNN method is verified on an aviation DC arc generation platform. It is found that the proposed method has a higher training efficiency and evaluation accuracy than the CNN method and CBAM-CNN method. In addition, the reconstructed CBAM-CNN involves fewer parameters to be measured, which can reduce its dependence on computing resources."
Using a Novel CNN Model for Predicting the Induction Heating Lines to Obtain a Desired Deformed Shape of Steel Plate,2023,"['Induction heating', 'Line heating', 'Triangle heating', 'R-CNN', 'Rotated region of interest (RROI)']",,"Induction heating is a fast and energy-efficient method of heating steel plates in the shipyard industry due to the increasing demand for steel plate deformation. In this study, deep learning models are proposed with abstract representations of heatmap images allowing efficient recognition of complex and nonlinear patterns. The model for determining the heating type for the plastic zone is a fairly simple and effective approach to perform the heating type determination with the choice of weight optimization of network. A novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained to predict heating regions from heatmap images with different vertical displacements of the required steel plate. We have proposed a Region based CNN (R-CNN) model using a sparse group to classify heating lines based on heatmap images of desired complex shape as input. The rotated region of interest pool layers and the rotated bounding box regression are also suggested to recognize inclined slender shapes of heating lines. The R-CNN is trained to detect heating regions bounded by labelled boxes within the confines of the steel plate. A frame-based event predictor for deformation areas is trained independently to analyse each individual box in the regions proposed. Then a post-processing step is based on the output of the R-CNN to determine the actual heating zones. By evaluating through the data sets, we have experimentally found that the proposed algorithm has performed well and achieved better results than other conventional methods."

One-Class Convolutional Neural Network (OC-CNN) Model for Rapid Bridge Damage Detection Using Bridge Response Data,2023,"['Rapid bridge damage detection', 'Semi-supervised learning', 'Convolutional neural network', 'Bridge response data', 'Damage-sensitive features', 'Vehicle-bridge coupling system']",,"This study proposes a numerical investigation for rapid bridge damage detection based on a semi-supervised deep learning (DL) model and a damage index (DI)-based Gaussian process. The proposed damage detection method uses bridge response data (acceleration and displacement data) from various damage scenarios within a simply supported girder bridge subjected to a two-axle moving vehicle load. As for semi-supervised learning, we used a one-class convolutional neural network (OC-CNN) model. This model combines a one-class (OC) classification algorithm with a simple one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) configuration. The performance of the proposed OC-CNN model was evaluated through a numerical example of a vehicle-bridge coupling system. The proposed OC-CNN model trained using acceleration data showed promising results for different vehicle weights and speeds. These results offer confidence in using the prediction error loss of the proposed OC-CNN model as an ideal damage-sensitive feature for rapid bridge damage detection. In addition, the Gaussian process used in the DI can classify the prediction error losses resulting from the change induced by different damage severities (10%, 20%, and 30%) and different types of damage scenarios (single damage, double damages, and multiple damages). These results emphasize the potential of the proposed damage detection method to monitor the state of bridges in practical engineering."
Time-Domain Measurement Data Accumulation for Slow Moving Point Target Detection in Heavily Cluttered Environments Using CNN,2023,"['CNN', 'Constant Processing Time', 'Clutter', 'Radar Target Detection']",,"In modern radars, the target detection probability is increased by lowering the detection threshold via signal processing to detect a point target with a small radar cross-section value. However, a lower threshold increases the number of false targets. In the conventional tracking method, which uses a general tracking filter, the measurement data between scans should be compared. Therefore, for a large amount of acquired measurement data, the computational complexity can be reduced by accumulating the acquired measurement data over time, recognizing the target movement as a pattern, and training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Here, we propose a method to create a desired target scenario by transfer learning and estimate the target position using the activation map of a binary detector CNN model. The model can detect a target using the actual acquired radar data, and the processing time remains constant, regardless of the number of false alarms."

GNSS NLOS Signal Classifier with Successive Correlation Outputs using CNN,2023,"['GNSS', 'multipath', 'NLOS', 'CNN']",,"The problem of classifying a non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signal in a multipath channel is important to improve global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning accuracy in urban areas. Conventional deep learning-based NLOS signal classifiers use GNSS satellite measurements such as the carrier-to-noise-density ratio (CN_0), pseudorange, and elevation angle as inputs. However, there is a computational inefficiency with use of these measurements and the NLOS signal features expressed by the measurements are limited. In this paper, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based NLOS signal classifier that receives successive Auto-correlation function (ACF) outputs according to a time-series, which is the most primitive output of GNSS signal processing. We compared the proposed classifier to other DL-based NLOS signal classifiers such as a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to show the superiority of the proposed classifier. The results show the proposed classifier does not require the navigation data extraction stage to classify the NLOS signals, and it has been verified that it has the best detection performance among all compared classifiers, with an accuracy of up to 97%."

The proposed model consists of target context detection (TCD), which detects subjects and actions, and activity image caption, which generates sentences centered on actions. The proposed TCD uses two RCNN heads to estimate objects and their properties. In this process, we added target-description region expansion to filter out unnecessary objects and encompass surrounding information. Afterward, the proposed activity image caption combines the feature vector and attributes of each target to generate a short description of the target-attribute pair.

Commercial buildings usually account for 20% of all energy used, with approximately 30% being wasted. Accurate load forecasting for commercial buildings can help improve operational efficiency. For accurate forecasting load, deep learning models have been used. Furthermore, the selection of input data has become important because the forecasting results can vary depending on which input data is trained. However, although various hybrid models have used historical sequential data as input data using the sliding window approach, they did not consider the hourly correlation between factors and load while selecting input data.

Lung cancer often has no early symptoms, so patients often miss the time of treatment. Accordingly, in Korea, lung cancer has been included in the national cancer screening since 2019. However, among misdiagnosis cases, lung cancer had the highest misdiagnosis rate, and the accuracy of screening may vary depending on the medical specialist's skill level and fatigue. Accordingly, this paper proposed a lung cancer CADx(Computer-Aided Diagnosis) system based on EfficientNetV2-L and ConvNeXt-B.

At present, the pattern recognition of partial discharge (PD) in a transformer has the problem of the insufficient generalization ability of the classifier due to scarcity and imbalance of samples, resulting in low recognition accuracy. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a pattern recognition of the PD method based on information maximizing generative adversarial nets (InfoGAN) and convolutional neural networks. In this method, phase-resolved partial discharge (PRPD) maps, constructed from pulse current waveforms, are chosen as the training samples. First, the InfoGAN is trained to generate new samples which expanded the original sample database, then various classifiers are trained by using the expanded sample database to realize the pattern recognition. Results of the test show that the proposed method can generate new highly similar samples more stable than other data enhancement methods, and effectively enrich the data diversity. In addition, the classifier trained by the expanded sample database has better generalization ability and is applicable to different classifiers, while residual network 18 has the highest recognition rate of 99.0%. This method can effectively balance and expand PRPD samples, and improve the recognition accuracy of the classifier to a certain extent. It has a good application prospect in PD diagnosis engineering."
Condition Monitoring of Railway Pantograph Using R-CNN and Image Processing,2023,"['Electric railway', 'Pantograph', 'Contact strip', 'Maintenance']",,"A railway pantograph supplies a vehicle with the electric power from the OCL (Overhead Contact Line). The contact strip, which directly contacts the OCL, is vulnerable to wear and should be periodically replaced to prevent accidents from power outages. To that end, the pantograph is regularly checked visually during routine maintenance, along with the panhead which includes the horn and the contact strip. However, real-time monitoring is still difficult, and a reliable method needs to be developed. The existing methods use image processing to detect the actual condition of the contact strip. In this paper, we suggest a method for detecting the wear size of the contact strip using image processing and deep learning. In addition, we demonstrate how to assess the condition of the panhead and the horn in the contact. The monitoring equipment is built on the test bed and is automatically configured to acquire images of the moving pantograph. The tilt of the panhead is estimated from image recognition and the condition of the horn is assessed with deep learning. In the future, this method can be used not only for efficient pantograph maintenance but also for determining the performance according to the contact condition."

CRNN 알고리즘은 이미지 분류를 위한CNN과 시계열적 요소를 인식하기 위한 RNN의 조합으로 구성되는데, CRNN의 RNN영역에서 사용하는입력값은 학습 대상의 이미지를 합성곱과 풀링 기법을 적용하여 추출된 결과물을 flatten한 값이고, 이 입력값들은 이미지 내 동일 위상에 있는 픽셀값들이 서로 다른 순서로 나타나기 때문에, RNN에서의도한 이미지 내 배열 순서를 제대로 학습하기 어렵다는 한계점을 지닌다. 따라서 본 연구는 인코더와디코더의 개념을 응용한 CNN과 RNN의 새로운 하이브리드 방법을 제안하여, 이미지 분류 성능을향상시키는 것을 목적으로 하였다. 본 연구에서는 다양한 알고리즘 비교 실험을 통해, 새로운 하이브리드방법의 효과성을 검증하였다. 본 연구는 인코더와 디코더 개념의 적용 가능성을 넓히고, 제안한 방법이기존 하이브리드 방법에 비해, 복잡도가 크게 증가하지 않아 모델 학습 시간과 인프라 구축 비용측면에서 이점을 있다는 점에서 학문적 시사점을 가진다. 또한, 정확한 이미지 분류가 필요한 다양한분야에서 제공되는 서비스의 품질을 높일 수 있는 가능성을 제시하였다는 점에서 실무적 시사점을가진다.","In the era of big data, the field of artificial intelligence is showing remarkable growth, and in particular, the image classification learning methods by deep learning are becoming an important area. Various studies have been actively conducted to further improve the performance of CNNs, which have been widely used in image classification, among which a representative method is the Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) algorithm. The CRNN algorithm consists of a combination of CNN for image classification and RNNs for recognizing time series elements. However, since the inputs used in the RNN area of CRNN are the flatten values extracted by applying the convolution and pooling technique to the image, pixel values in the same phase in the image appear in different order. And this makes it difficult to properly learn the sequence of arrangements in the image intended by the RNN. Therefore, this study aims to improve image classification performance by proposing a novel hybrid method of CNN and RNN applying the concepts of encoder and decoder. In this study, the effectiveness of the new hybrid method was verified through various experiments. This study has academic implications in that it broadens the applicability of encoder and decoder concepts, and the proposed method has advantages in terms of model learning time and infrastructure construction costs as it does not significantly increase complexity compared to conventional hybrid methods. In addition, this study has practical implications in that it presents the possibility of improving the quality of services provided in various fields that require accurate image classification."

Hyperparameters optimization of convolutional neural network based on local autonomous competition harmony search algorithm,2023,"['harmony search algorithm', 'convolutional neural network', 'optimization speed', 'hyperparameters optimization']",,"Because of the good performance of convolutional neural network (CNN), it has been extensively used in many fields, such as image, speech, text, etc. However, it is easily affected by hyperparameters. How to effectively configure hyperparameters at a reasonable time to improve the performance of CNNs has always been a complex problem. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a method to automatically optimize CNN hyperparameters based on the local autonomous competitive harmony search (LACHS) algorithm. To avoid the influence of complicated parameter adjustment of LACHS algorithm on its performance, a parameter dynamic adjustment strategy is adopted, which makes the pitch adjustment probability PAR and step factor BW dynamically adjust according to the actual situation. To strengthen the fine search of neighborhood space and reduce the possibility of falling into local optima for a long time, an autonomous decision-making search strategy based on the optimal state is designed. To help the algorithm jump out of the local fitting situation, this paper proposes a local competition mechanism to make the new sound competes with the worst harmonic progression of local selection. In addition, an evaluation function is proposed, which integrates the training times and recognition accuracy. To achieve the purpose of saving the calculation cost without affecting the search result, it makes the training time for each model depending on the learning rate and batch size. In order to prove the feasibility of LACHS algorithm in configuring CNN superparameters, the classification of the Fashion-MNIST dataset and CIFAR10 dataset is tested. The comparison is made between CNN based on empirical configuration and CNN based on classical algorithms to optimize hyperparameters automatically. The results show that the performance of CNN based on the LACHS algorithm has been improved effectively, so this algorithm has certain advantages in hyperparametric optimization. In addition, this paper applies the LACHS algorithm to expression recognition. Experiments show that the performance of CNN optimized based on the LACHS algorithm is better than that of the same type of artificially designed CNN. Therefore, the method proposed in this paper is feasible in practical application."

Materials and Methods: An online search was performed of the PubMed, Science Direct, and Scopus databases. Based on the selection process, 12 studies were included in this review. Results: Eleven studies utilized a CNN model for detection tasks, 5 for classification tasks, and 3 for segmentation tasks in the context of tooth numbering on panoramic radiographs. Most of these studies revealed high performance of various CNN models in automating tooth numbering. However, several studies also highlighted limitations of CNNs, such as the presence of false positives and false negatives in identifying decayed teeth, teeth with crown prosthetics, teeth adjacent to edentulous areas, dental implants, root remnants, wisdom teeth, and root canal-treated teeth. These limitations can be overcome by ensuring both the quality and quantity of datasets, as well as optimizing the CNN architecture. Conclusion: CNNs have demonstrated high performance in automated tooth numbering on panoramic radiographs. Future development of CNN-based models for this purpose should also consider different stages of dentition, such as the primary and mixed dentition stages, as well as the presence of various tooth conditions.

A typical encoder-decoder model, such as an autoencoder, transforms the encoder input into a latent vector and feeds it into the decoder. In this process, the encoder-decoder model learns to produce an decoder output similar to the encoder input. We can consider that the latent vector of the encoder-decoder model is well preserved by abstracting the characteristics of the encoder input. Further, it is possible to apply to unsupervised learning, if the latent vector guarantees a sufficient distance between clusters in the feature space. In this paper, the classification performance of latent vectors is analyzed as a basic study for applying latent vectors in encoder-decoder models to unsupervised and continual learning. The latent vectors obtained by the stacked autoencoder and 2 types of CNN-based autoencoder are applied to 4 kinds of classifiers including KNN and random forest. Experimental results show that the latent vector using the CNN-based autoencoder with a dense layer (about 97%) shows superior classification performance by up to 2% compared to the result of the stacked autoencoder (about 95%). Based on the results in this paper, it is possible to extend the latent vector obtained by using a CNN-based auto-encoder with dense layer to unsupervised learning."

MR Template-Based Individual Brain PET Volumes-of-Interest Generation Neither Using MR nor Using Spatial Normalization,2023,['Mouse brain · Deep convolutional-neural-network (CNN) · Inverse-spatial-normalization (iSN) · Templatebased volume of interest (VOI)'],,"For more anatomically precise quantitation of mouse brain PET, spatial normalization (SN) of PET onto MR template andsubsequent template volumes-of-interest (VOIs)-based analysis are commonly used. Although this leads to dependency onthe corresponding MR and the process of SN, routine preclinical/clinical PET images cannot always afford correspondingMR and relevant VOIs. To resolve this issue, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based individual-brain-specific VOIs (i.e.,cortex, hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, and cerebellum) directly generated from PET images using the inverse-spatialnormalization(iSN)-based VOI labels and deep convolutional neural network model (deep CNN). Our technique was appliedto mutated amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Eighteen mice underwentT2-weighted MRI and 18F FDG PET scans before and after the administration of human immunoglobin or antibody-basedtreatments. To train the CNN, PET images were used as inputs and MR iSN-based target VOIs as labels. Our devised methodsachieved decent performance in terms of not only VOI agreements (i.e., Dice similarity coefficient) but also the correlationof mean counts and SUVR, and CNN-based VOIs was highly accordant with ground-truth (the corresponding MR and MRtemplate-based VOIs). Moreover, the performance metrics were comparable to that of VOI generated by MR-based deepCNN. In conclusion, we established a novel quantitative analysis method both MR-less and SN-less fashion to generateindividual brain space VOIs using MR template-based VOIs for PET image quantification."

Comparison of machine learning and deep learning techniques for the prediction of air pollution: a case study from China,2023,"['AQI', 'Bidirectional GRU', 'Bidirectional LSTM', 'CNN BiLSTM', 'Conv1D BiLSTM']",,"The adverse effect of air pollution has always been a problem for human health. The presence of a high level of air pollutants can cause severe illnesses such as emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or asthma. Air quality prediction helps us to undertake practical action plans for controlling air pollution. The Air Quality Index (AQI) reflects the degree of concentration of pollutants in a locality. The average AQI was calculated for the various cities in China to understand the annual trends. Furthermore, the air quality index has been predicted for ten major cities across China using five different deep learning techniques, namely, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Bidirectional Gated Recurrent unit (Bi-GRU), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Convolutional Neural Network BiLSTM (CNN-BiLSTM), and Convolutional BiLSTM (Conv1D-BiLSTM). The performance of these models has been compared with a machine learning model, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to discover the most efficient deep learning model. The results suggest that the machine learning model, XGBoost, outperforms the deep learning models. While Conv1D-BiLSTM and CNN-BiLSTM perform well among the deep learning models in the estimation of the air quality index (AQI), RNN and Bi-GRU are the least performing ones. Thus, both XGBoost and neural network models are capable of capturing the non-linearity present in the dataset with reliable accuracy."

AD currently has no cure. Therefore, the need to develop an efficient model with high precision for timely detection of the disease is very essential. When AD is detected early, treatment would be most likely successful. The most often utilized indicators for AD identification are the Mini-mental state examination (MMSE), and the clinical dementia. However, the use of these indicators as ground truth marking could be imprecise for AD detection. Researchers have proposed several computer-aided frameworks and lately, the supervised model is mostly used. In this study, we propose a novel 3D Convolutional Neural Network Multilayer Perceptron (3D CNN-MLP) based model for AD classification. The model uses Attention Mechanism to automatically extract relevant features from Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) to generate probability maps which serves as input for the MLP classifier. Three MRI scan categories were considered, thus AD dementia patients, Mild Cognitive Impairment patients (MCI), and Normal Control (NC) or healthy patients. The performance of the model is assessed by comparing basic CNN, VGG16, DenseNet models, and other state of the art works. The models were adjusted to fit the 3D images before the comparison was done. Our model exhibited excellent classification performance, with an accuracy of 91.27% for AD and NC, 80.85% for MCI and NC, and 87.34% for AD and MCI."

This paper proposes an online health estimation strategy with transfer learning for estimating the state of health (SOH) of batteries under varying charge–discharge depths and current rates. It aims to alleviate the diffi culty in estimating SOH for operating batteries, and broaden the application range of the training model. The core of this strategy is a two-domain transfer CNN-LSTM model that estimates targets by transferring the battery degradation trends of multiple constant conditions. First, health indicators (HIs) with relatively high correlations and wide application ranges are extracted from the voltage and current data of the daily charge process. Then HI-based source domain selection criteria are designed. Since the battery experiences full and incomplete-discharged cases leading to various aging rates, a two-domain transfer CNN-LSTM model is designed. Each subnet includes a CNN and an LSTM to accomplish feature adaptation and time series forecasting. The weights of the sub-nets are updated online to track the drift of the time series covariates.

Deep learning based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has been verified for its performance in various areas. It has also demonstrated high recognition accuracy and detection time in agricultural applications such as pest and disease diagnosis and prediction. A large amount of data is required to train CNNs effectively. Still, since UAVs capture only a limited number of images, we propose a data augmentation method that can effectively increase data. And most occupancy prediction predicts occupancy by designing a CNN-based object detector for an image and counting the number of recognized objects or calculating the number of pixels occupied by an object. These methods require complex occupancy rate calculations; the accuracy depends on whether the object features of interest are visible in the image. However, in this study, CNN is not approached as a corn object detection and classification problem but as a function approximation and regression problem so that the occupancy rate of corn objects in an image can be represented as the CNN output. The proposed method effectively estimates occupancy for a limited number of cornfield photos, shows excellent prediction accuracy, and confirms the potential and scalability of deep learning."

Initially, word filtering techniques were used to prevent malicious writing from being posted in a form that could not post or comment if a specific word was included, but they avoided filtering in a bypassed form, such as using similar words. As a way to solve this problem, deep learning was used to monitor posts posted by users in real-time, but recently, the community uses words that can only be understood by the community or from a human perspective, not from a general Korean word. There are various types and forms of characters, making it difficult to learn everything in the artificial intelligence model.

Attention for Adaptive Convolution in Convolutional Neural Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution,2023,"['Deep learning', 'Convolutional Neural Network', 'Single Image Super-resolution', 'Adaptive Convolution', 'Attention']",,"There have been many works on single image super-resolution (SISR) using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), researching on network architecture, loss function, applications, etc. However, very few have studied the modification or adaptation of the convolution operation, which is the fundamental element of CNN. In most CNN-based methods, the filter weights do not change at the inference phase, i.e., filter parameters are fixed regardless of the input and its regional characteristics. We note that this conventional approach is parameter-efficient but may not be optimal in performance due to its inflexibility to regionally different input statistics. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel convolution operation named Adaptive Convolution, which has content-specific characteristics. The proposed method adaptively adjusts filter weights according to the regional characteristics of the input with the help of an attention mechanism. We also introduce a kernel fragmentation method, which enables the efficient implementation of the Adaptive Convolution. We embed our new convolutional layer into several well-known SR networks and show that it enhances their performances while requiring a small number of additional parameters. Also, our method can be used along with other attentions that manipulate the features, further increasing the performance."

While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based text recognition networks have demonstrated commendable performance, they grapple with the aforementioned challenges. Recently, transformer-based feature extractors have exhibited advantages in global feature extraction from images, especially in the context of irregular text images. By employing self-attention, these transformers establish information connections between different parts of the image, thereby mitigating the impact of uneven character distribution. This study proposes multi-encoder scene text recognition (MESTR), a hybrid approach that combines a CNN-based and a transformer-based feature extractor.

However, the reservoir faces several issues that jeopardize its efficient operation and management. To address this issues, we propose a novel deep-learning-based water level recognition model that uses CCTV image data to accurately estimate water levels in agricultural reservoirs. The model consists of three main parts: (1) dataset construction, (2) image segmentation using the U-Net algorithm, and (3) CCTV-based water level recognition using either CNN or ResNet.

The study constructed a deep learning model using façade images of buildings located on various local commercial streets in Seoul. In each region, identity is related to individual perceptions and can be described as a collection of images that individuals perceive regarding that region. In many parts of Seoul, local identities have changed, been lost, or have been established during the rapid urbanization process, and related research has been conducted. This study focused on visual elements among the various components that make up these local identities, and utilized deep learning technology to confirm whether each region's identity can be inferred from local visual data alone. With the increased awareness of artificial intelligence, deep learning technology has been expanded and used in various contexts, such as creating images and text, and research on applications such as inference and automation using visual intelligence models has continued in the architectural spatial design field. (Method) This study collected data from various commercial streets in Seoul and built a deep learning model by processing the collected data. The specific processes can be summarized in the following order: 1) acquisition of regional building façade images using the street view function of portal sites, 2) construction of façade datasets through image data preprocessing, 3) utilization and learning of pre-trained CNN-based deep learning models, and 4) a review and discussion of the results from the test image data. (Results) Through the built regional façade image dataset and deep learning model, it was confirmed that images were classified by region only with visual information called façade images of each commercial street. In particular, as a result of learning and testing the model, it was confirmed that façade images in a specific region were classified with high accuracy. This can be presumed to be due to reasons such as policies for commercial streets in the region, such as a clearly lower proportion of franchise stores than in other regions. Thus, it was confirmed that identity can be inferred through the façade image learning model of commercial streets by region using only aesthetic factors. (Conclusions) Existing regional and commercial identity-related studies have defined locality using qualitative methodologies, such as interviews and surveys of local residents and visitors. However, this study is meaningful in that it presented a more time- and cost-effective quantitative approach."

Therefore, the research combines the SIFT (scale-invariant feature transform) algorithm with the Gabor features and CNN (convolutional neural network (Ed note. Acronyms only need to be defined once.)) to form an improved new algorithm. The algorithm divides the features of the image into several different categories. In each category, the features will be fully identified and extracted, and different levels of feature matching will be performed. The properties of the SIFT algorithm are used to form an operational stacking pyramid and combine the Gabor features and CNN with it. The Gabor filter is formed into a filter bank to obtain parameters, including frequency, scale, and direction in various dimensions. The results are fused to obtain a fusion Gabor descriptor. The high sensitivity of CNN to images, particularly colors, is applied to the algorithm to make monitoring the algorithm more accurate.

The speedy exhaustion of powdered materials stored in the tank of bulk trailers is relevant to improving transportation efficiency and reducing transportation costs. The exhaust time can be reduced by developing an automatic control system to replace the manual exhaust operation. The instantaneous or accumulated exhausts of powdered materials must be measured for automatic control of the bulk trailer exhaust system. Accordingly, we previously proposed a recurrent neural network (RNN) model that estimated the instantaneous exhaust based on low-cost pressure sensor signals without an expensive flowmeter for powders. Although our previous study utilized only an RNN model, models such as multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) are also widely utilized for time-series estimation. This study compares the performance of three neural network models (MLP, CNN, and RNN) in estimating instantaneous and accumulated exhausts. In terms of the instantaneous exhaust estimation, the difference in the performance of neural network models was insignificant (that is, 8.64, 8.62, and 8.56% for the MLP, CNN, and RNN, respectively, in terms of the normalized root mean squared error).

A Ship-Wake Joint Detection Using Sentinel-2 Imagery,2023,"['Ship detection', 'Random forest', 'Mask R-CNN', 'Wake detection']",,"Ship detection is widely used in areas such as maritime security, maritime traffic, fisheriesmanagement, illegal fishing, and border control, and ship detection is important for rapid response and damageminimization as ship accident rates increase due to recent increases in international maritime traffic. Currently,according to a number of global and national regulations, ships must be equipped with automatic identificationsystem (AIS), which provide information such as the location and speed of the ship periodically at regularintervals. However, most small vessels (less than 300 tons) are not obligated to install the transponder and maynot be transmitted intentionally or accidentally. There is even a case of misuse of the ship’s location information.Therefore, in this study, ship detection was performed using high-resolution optical satellite images that canperiodically remotely detect a wide range and detect small ships. However, optical images can cause false-alarmdue to noise on the surface of the sea, such as waves, or factors indicating ship-like brightness, such as cloudsand wakes. So, it is important to remove these factors to improve the accuracy of ship detection. In this study,false alarm was reduced, and the accuracy of ship detection was improved by removing wake. As a ship detectionmethod, ship detection was performed using machine learning-based random forest (RF), and convolutionalneural network (CNN) techniques that have been widely used in object detection fields recently, and ship detectionresults by the model were compared and analyzed. In addition, in this study, the results of RF and CNN werecombined to improve the phenomenon of ship disconnection and the phenomenon of small detection. The shipdetection results of this study are significant in that they improved the limitations of each model while maintainingaccuracy. In addition, if satellite images with improved spatial resolution are utilized in the future, it is expectedthat ship and wake simultaneous detection with higher accuracy will be performed."

The approach entails tightening eight bolts with different clamping forces and generating frequency responses, which are then used to create a similarity map. This map quantifies the magnitude and shape similarity between the frequency responses and the initial model in a fully fastened state. Krylov subspace-based model order reduction is employed to efficiently handle the large amount of frequency response data.

Then, the evolution stages were divided by using unsupervised clustering method. Finally, the remaining useful life (RUL) was predicted based on particle filter (PF). Three different groups of whole life cycle data of rolling bearings under various working conditions were used to prove the feasibility of the indicator. The results show that the wavelet-CNN features of completely different fault data show similar evolution trends, and the normalization of warning threshold can be realized based on the train labels.

Automatic Detection of Type II Solar Radio Burst by Using 1-D Convolution Neutral Network,2023,"['Sun: radio radiation', 'shock waves', 'methods: observational', 'techniques: image processing', 'radio continuum: transients']",,"Type II solar radio bursts show frequency drifts from high to low over time. They have been known as a signature of coronal shock associated with Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and/or flares, which cause an abrupt change in the space environment near the Earth (space weather). Therefore, early detection of type II bursts is important for forecasting of space weather. In this study, we develop a deep-learning (DL) model for the automatic detection of type II bursts. For this purpose, we adopted a 1-D Convolution Neutral Network (CNN) as it is well-suited for processing spatiotemporal information within the applied data set. We utilized a total of 286 radio burst spectrum images obtained by Hiraiso Radio Spectrograph (HiRAS) from 1991 and 2012, along with 231 spectrum images without the bursts from 2009 to 2015, to recognizes type II bursts. The burst types were labeled manually according to their spectra features in an answer table. Subsequently, we applied the 1-D CNN technique to the spectrum images using two filter windows with different size along time axis. To develop the DL model, we randomly selected 412 spectrum images (80%) for training and validation. The train history shows that both train and validation losses drop rapidly, while train and validation accuracies increased within approximately 100 epoches. For evaluation of the model's performance, we used 105 test images (20%) and employed a contingence table. It is found that false alarm ratio (FAR) and critical success index (CSI) were 0.14 and 0.83, respectively. Furthermore, we confirmed above result by adopting five-fold cross-validation method, in which we re-sampled five groups randomly. The estimated mean FAR and CSI of the five groups were 0.05 and 0.87, respectively. For experimental purposes, we applied our proposed model to 85 HiRAS type II radio bursts listed in the NGDC catalogue from 2009 to 2016 and 184 quiet (no bursts) spectrum images before and after the type I bursts. As a result, our model successfully detected 79 events (93%) of type II events. This results demonstrates, for the first time, that the 1-D CNN algorithm is useful for detecting type II bursts."
Himawari-8 정지궤도 위성 영상을 활용한 딥러닝 기반 산불 탐지의 효율적 방안 제시,2023,[],,"As wildfires are difficult to predict, real-time monitoring is crucial for a timely response. Geostationary satellite images are very useful for active fire detection because they can monitor a vast area with high temporal resolution (e.g., 2 min). Existing satellite-based active fire detection algorithms detect thermal outliers using threshold values based on the statistical analysis of brightness temperature. However, the difficulty in establishing suitable thresholds for such threshold-based methods hinders their ability to detect fires with low intensity and achieve generalized performance. In light of these challenges, machine learning has emerged as a potential-solution. Until now, relatively simple techniques such as random forest, Vanilla convolutional neural network (CNN), and U-net have been applied for active fire detection. Therefore, this study proposed an active fire detection algorithm using state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning techniques using data from the Advanced Himawari Imager and evaluated it over East Asia and Australia. The SOTA model was developed by applying EfficientNet and lion optimizer, and the results were compared with the model using the Vanilla CNN structure. EfficientNet outperformed CNN with F1-scores of 0.88 and 0.83 in East Asia and Australia, respectively. The performance was better after using weighted loss, equal sampling, and image augmentation techniques to fix data imbalance issues compared to before the techniques were used, resulting in F1-scores of 0.92 in East Asia and 0.84 in Australia. It is anticipated that timely responses facilitated by the SOTA deep learning-based approach for active fire detection will effectively mitigate the damage caused by wildfires."

The proposed model concatenates consumer-restaurant interactions with the extracted high-level semantic representations and predicts consumer preferences accurately and effectively. Experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed model exhibits excellent recommendation performance compared with several baseline models."

Although vision transformer deep learning models have outperformed conventional convolutional neural network (CNN) models in computer vision, they require more computations and parameters than CNN models. Thus, they are not directly applicable to embedded edge devices with limited hardware resources. Many researchers have proposed various model compression methods or lightweight architectures for vision transformers; however, there are only a few studies evaluating the effects of model compression techniques of vision transformers on performance. Regarding this problem, this paper presents a performance evaluation of vision transformers on embedded platforms. We investigated the behaviors of three vision transformers: DeiT, LeViT, and MobileViT. Each model performance was evaluated by accuracy and inference time on edge devices using the ImageNet dataset. We assessed the effects of the quantization method applied to the models on latency enhancement and accuracy degradation by profiling the proportion of response time occupied by major operations. In addition, we evaluated the performance of each model on GPU and EdgeTPU-based edge devices. In our experimental results, LeViT showed the best performance in CPU-based edge devices, and DeiT-small showed the highest performance improvement in GPU-based edge devices. In addition, only MobileViT models showed performance improvement on EdgeTPU. Summarizing the analysis results through profiling,  the degree of performance improvement of each vision transformer model was highly dependent on the proportion of parts that could be optimized in the target edge device. In summary, to apply vision transformers to on-device AI solutions, either proper operation composition and optimizations specific to target edge devices must be considered."

Optimized hyperparameter settings were determined by design of experiments (DoE) applied to the proposed CNN model. Experimental results showed that the proposed method had better performance than the multiple regression analysis (MLR) or back propagation neural network (BPNN) methods in terms of estimation accuracy and robustness at different spindle speeds.
Predicting the Baltic Dry Bulk Freight Index Using an Ensemble Neural Network Model,2023,"['BDI', 'Shipping Freight Rates', 'Artificial neural networks', 'Ensemble model', 'shipping forecast']",,"The maritime industry is playing an increasingly vital part in global economic expansion. Specifically, the Baltic Dry Index is highly correlated with global commodity prices. Hence, the importance of BDI prediction research increases. But, since the global situation has become more volatile, it has become methodologically more difficult to predict the BDI accurately. This paper proposes an integrated machine-learning strategy for accurately forecasting BDI trends. This study combines the benefits of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) for research on prediction. We collected daily BDI data for over 27 years for model fitting. The research findings indicate that CNN successfully extracts BDI data features. On this basis, LSTM predicts BDI accurately.

ACA: Automatic search strategy for radioactive source,2023,"['Radioactive source search', 'Source location estimation', 'Path planning', 'Occupancy grid map', 'Monte Carlo']",,"Nowadays, mobile robots have been used to search for uncontrolled radioactive source in indoor environments to avoid radiation exposure for technicians. However, in the indoor environments, especially in the presence of obstacles, how to make the robots with limited sensing capabilities automatically search for the radioactive source remains a major challenge. Also, the source search efficiency of robots needs to be further improved to meet practical scenarios such as limited exploration time. This paper proposes an automatic source search strategy, abbreviated as ACA: the location of source is estimated by a convolutional neural network (CNN), and the path is planned by the A-star algorithm. First, the search area is represented as an occupancy grid map. Then, the radiation dose distribution of the radioactive source in the occupancy grid map is obtained by Monte Carlo (MC) method simulation, and multiple sets of radiation data are collected through the eight neighborhood self-avoiding random walk (ENSAW) algorithm as the radiation data set. Further, the radiation data set is fed into the designed CNN architecture to train the network model in advance. When the searcher enters the search area where the radioactive source exists, the location of source is estimated by the network model and the search path is planned by the A-star algorithm, and this process is iterated continuously until the searcher reaches the location of radioactive source. The experimental results show that the average number of radiometric measurements and the average number of moving steps of the ACA algorithm are only 2.1% and 33.2% of those of the gradient search (GS) algorithm in the indoor environment without obstacles. In the indoor environment shielded by concrete walls, the GS algorithm fails to search for the source, while the ACA algorithm successfully searches for the source with fewer moving steps and sparse radiometric data"

However, these methods are both costly and time-consuming, so hull-form designers use statistical methods for a quick feed-back during the early design stage. It is well known that results from statistical methods are often less accurate compared to those from CFD simulations or model tests. To overcome this problem, this study suggests a new approach using a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) with voxelized hull-form data. By converting the original Computer Aided Design (CAD) data into three dimensional voxels, the CNN is able to abstract the hull-form data, focusing only on important features. For the verification, suggested method in this study was compared to a parametric method that uses hull parameters such as length overall and block coefficient as inputs. The results showed that the use of voxelized data significantly improves resistance performance prediction accuracy, compared to the parametric approach."

The accurate forecasting of traffic characteristics like flow, congestion, and density is still active research because of the non-linear nature and uncertainty of the spatiotemporal data. Inclement weather, such as rain and snow, and other special events such as holidays, accidents, and road closures have a significant impact on driving and the average speed of vehicles on the road, which lowers traffic capacity and causes congestion in a widespread manner. This work designs a model for multivariate short-term traffic congestion prediction using SLSTM_AE-BiLSTM. The proposed design consists of a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory(BiLSTM) network to predict traffic flow value and a Convolutional Neural network (CNN) model for detecting the congestion status. This model uses spatial static temporal dynamic data. The stacked Long Short Term Memory Autoencoder (SLSTM AE) is used to encode the weather features into a reduced and more informative feature space. BiLSTM model is used to capture the features from the past and present traffic data simultaneously and also to identify the long-term dependencies. It uses the traffic data and encoded weather data to perform the traffic flow prediction. The CNN model is used to predict the recurring congestion status based on the predicted traffic flow value at a particular urban traffic network. In this work, a publicly available Caltrans PEMS dataset with traffic parameters is used. The proposed model generates the congestion prediction with an accuracy rate of 92.74% which is slightly better when compared with other deep learning models for congestion prediction."

Deep learning predicts the differentiation of kidney organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells,2023,"['Deep learning', 'Gene expression', 'Kidney', 'Organoids']",,"Background: Kidney organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) contain multilineage nephrogenic progenitor cells andcan recapitulate the development of the kidney. Kidney organoids derived from hPSCs have the potential to be applied in regenerative medicineas well as renal disease modeling, drug screening, and nephrotoxicity testing. Despite biotechnological advances, individual differencesin morphological and growth characteristics among kidney organoids need to be addressed before clinical and commercial application. Inthis study, we hypothesized that an automated noninvasive method based on deep learning of bright-field images of kidney organoids canpredict their differentiation status.Methods: Bright-field images of kidney organoids were collected on day 18 after differentiation. To train convolutional neural networks(CNNs), we utilized a transfer learning approach. CNNs were trained to predict the differentiation of kidney organoids on bright-field imagesbased on the messenger RNA expression of renal tubular epithelial cells as well as podocytes.Results: The best prediction model was DenseNet121 with a total Pearson correlation coefficient score of 0.783 on a test dataset. W classifiedthe kidney organoids into two categories: organoids with above-average gene expression (Positive) and those with below-average geneexpression (Negative). Comparing the best-performing CNN with human-based classifiers, the CNN algorithm had a receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve (AUC) score of 0.85, while the experts had an AUC score of 0.48.Conclusion: These results confirmed our original hypothesis and demonstrated that our artificial intelligence algorithm can successfully recognizethe differentiation status of kidney organoids."

This diagnostic technology can identify the presence of an abnormality or accident in whole system, and when an accident occurs, the type of accident and the location of the abnormality can be identified in real-time. For technology development, the experiment for the thermal image measurement and performance validation of major components at each accident condition of NPPs was conducted using a thermal-hydraulic integral effect test facility with compact infrared sensor modules.

While manual detection of potholes using human labor is commonly used to prevent pothole-related accidents, it is economically and temporally inefficient due to the exposure of workers on the road and the difficulty in predicting potholes in certain categories.Therefore, completely preventing potholes is nearly impossible, and even preventing their formation is limited due to the influence of ground conditions closely related to road environments.

This study aims to apply AI algorithms to predict the outcome of Korean professional basketball games and verify the applicability of sports betting. More specifically, we went beyond simply predicting the outcome of the game in a way that appears in actual sports betting by categorizing the outcome of the game according to the goal difference, such as winning by more than 6 points, losing by less than 5 points, and losing by more than 6 points.

Based on these variables, we trained and tested all variables using Light-GBM, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Based on the CNN algorithm, which has the best prediction performance, we predicted the matches of each team in the 2022∼2023 season, and as a result of analyzing the application of sports betting, we accurately predicted the results of 494 matches out of 540 matches.

Comparative Performance Evaluation of State-of-the-Art Hyperparameter Optimization Frameworks,2023,"['Deep learning', 'Neural networks', 'Hyperparameter optimization', 'Convolutional neural network']",,"Machine learning (ML) has proven to be highly effective in solving complex problems in various domains, thanks to its ability to identify specific data tasks, perform feature engineering, and learn quickly. However, designing and training ML models is a complicated task and requires optimization. The effectiveness of ML models is highly dependent on the selection of hyperparameters that determines their performance. Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is a systematic search process to find the optimal combinations of hyperparameters to achieve robust performance. Traditional HPO methods such as grid and random search take a lot of computing time when used in large-scale applications. Recently, various automated search strategies, such as Bayesian optimization (BO) and evolutionary algorithms, have been developed to significantly reduce the computing time. In this paper, we use state-of-the-art HPO frameworks, namely BO, Optuna, HyperOpt, and Keras Tuner, for optimizing the ML and deep learning models for the classification tasks and evaluate their comparative performance using two different sets of experiments. The first one uses different ML classifiers to solve the optimal parameter selection problem with HPO. The second one attempts to optimize the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture using HPO frameworks to improve its performance in the image classification task.We use four publicly available real-world datasets including one image dataset. The experimental results show that HyperOpt -TPE outperforms the other HPO frameworks for the ML classifiers and achieves up to 94.12% of accuracy with 30 minutes for performing the optimization. Similarly, for the CNN model, HyperOpt-TPE outperforms the other HPO frameworks by improving 34% of the classification accuracy, while taking 2 hours and 24 minutes of computing time."

Misdiagnosis of brain tumors can result in false medical intervention, which ultimately reduces a patient's chance of survival. Manual identification and segmentation of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans can be difficult and error-prone because of the great range of tumor tissues that exist in various individuals and the similarity of normal tissues. To overcome this limitation, the Amended Convolutional Neural Network (ACNN) model has been introduced, a unique combination of three techniques that have not been previously explored for brain tumor detection. The three techniques integrated into the ACNN model are image tissue pre-processing using the Kalman Bucy Smoothing Filter to remove noisy pixels from the input, image tissue segmentation using the Isotonic Regressive Image Tissue Segmentation Process, and feature extraction using the Marr Wavelet Transformation. The extracted features are compared with the testing features using a sigmoid activation function in the output layer.

Pine trees once accounted for more than 60% of the nations forests, but the proportion has decreased to 25% due to infestations and wildfires. To classify Koreas native pine trees, we use the standard image dataset held by the National Institute of Biological Resources to classify three species. Instead of modifying a pre-trained model like ResNet 50, which has been proven to perform well, we instead directly implement an image recognition model to perform species classification, which showed an accuracy of 85%, and then determined the features derived from the recognition process. To understand the impact of image size and growth on classification, we evaluated performance of the model through image size and image growth. The performance improvement was about 3% for image size and 6.4% for image growth. We also compare its performance with a machine learning model based on data labeling.

If judgment in real time is not necessary, it is most effective to judge the quality of a welded part using an exterior image. Therefore, in this study, a welded appearance quality judgment model was analyzed using image deep learning. Welding defects were classified into pores, overlaps, craters, melting of the base material, cracks, and undercuts, and were divided into 7 categories including normal ones. In constructing the deep-learning model, transfer learning was performed using existing networks, such as ResNet and AlexNet. To improve the accuracy of deep learning, tests were performed while the optimization technique, maximum number of epochs, and minibatch size were changed.

The goal of this study is to solve these problems and develop a single network that provides consistent 3D reconstruction of all humans in a scene. Integrating a human body model based on the SMPL parametric system into a top-down framework became an important choice. Through this, two types of collision loss based on distance field and loss that considers depth order were introduced. The first loss prevents overlap between reconstructed people, and the second loss adjusts the depth ordering of people to render occlusion inference and annotated instance segmentation consistently. This method allows depth information to be provided to the network without explicit 3D annotation of the image. Experimental results show that this study's methodology performs better than existing methods on standard 3D pose benchmarks, and the proposed losses enable more consistent reconstruction from natural images."

This attention layer empowers the proposed model to focus on critical elements during the code generation process, thereby optimizing its overall performance and accuracy. To evaluate the effectiveness of Pix2code-ATT, extensive experiments have been conducted with synthetic datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the model's capability to automatically generate source code from screen images while achieving text code creation within an acceptable range of error ratios."
A Study on DNN-based STT Error Correction,2023,"['STT Error Correction', 'Siamese Neural Networks', 'LSTM', 'DNN', 'CNN']",,"This study is about a speech recognition error correction system designed to detect and correct speech recognition errors before natural language processing to increase the success rate of intent analysis in natural language processing with optimal efficiency in various service domains. An encoder is constructed to embedded the correct speech token and one or more error speech tokens corresponding to the correct speech token so that they are all located in a dense vector space for each correct token with similar vector values. One or more utterance tokens within a preset Manhattan distance based on the correct utterance token in the dense vector space for each embedded correct utterance token are detected through an error detector, and the correct answer closest to the detected error utterance token is based on the Manhattan distance. Errors are corrected by extracting the utterance token as the correct answer."
Toward Practical Augmentation of Raman Spectra for Deep Learning Classification of Contamination in HDD,2023,"['Raman Spectral Classification', 'Data Augmentation', 'Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)', 'Hard Disk Drive', 'Small Particle']",,"Deep learning techniques provide powerful solutions to several pattern-recognition problems, including Raman spectral classification.However, these networks require large amounts of labeled data to perform well. Labeled data, which are typically obtained in alaboratory, can potentially be alleviated by data augmentation. This study investigated various data augmentation techniques andapplied multiple deep learning methods to Raman spectral classification. Raman spectra yield fingerprint-like information aboutchemical compositions, but are prone to noise when the particles of the material are small. Five augmentation models wereinvestigated to build robust deep learning classifiers: weighted sums of spectral signals, imitated chemical backgrounds, extendedmultiplicative signal augmentation, and generated Gaussian and Poisson-distributed noise. We compared the performance of ninestate-of-the-art convolutional neural networks with all the augmentation techniques. The LeNet5 models with background noiseaugmentation yielded the highest accuracy when tested on real-world Raman spectral classification at 88.33% accuracy. A classactivation map of the model was generated to provide a qualitative observation of the results."

However, conventional vision inspection systems are often equipped with expensive industrial cameras, which limits their wider use. This paper introduces a cost-effective presence verification system using low-cost UVC (USB Video Class) cameras. To tackle the inherent challenges arising from such cameras, we selected smartphone frames as a case study. We present a customized jig and data collection strategies to deal with the low-resolution and limited dynamic range issues inherent in low-cost cameras. Additionally, we perceive smartphone part inspection as a pseudo anomaly detection problem since acquiring non-attached parts samples or physically separating parts from already attached samples might not be feasible. In addition, considering the practical challenge of obtaining sufficient real-world samples and the ease of scaling for various parts and locations, we propose using conventional feature extraction and classification models. In our experiment, the proposed method achieved average performance of 99.96%, indicating its potential suitability for real- world industrial applications."

The number of accidents by drowsy drivers increases every year. So various studies have been performed to solve the issue all over the world. Among others, we focus on the non-contact method. Various vibration signals such as engine, tire, and body vibration are generated in a driving or stationary car. The existing static system is used to measure microscopic vibrations generated from the drivers breathing and heartbeat. It is necessary to design a structure that can cushion vehicle vibration through an advanced signal processing program. In this study, actual vehicles test was conducted to analyze the transmission characteristics of fine vibration through the change of plate structure under sensors. The plate structure is a urethane structure plate that can cushion vehicle vibration while driving. Furthermore, we developed an AI algorithm that classifies whether a subject is in a sleep state or not using a piezoelectric sensor-based BCG signal. This paper shows the AI method is more accurate than the method of classifying sleep states according to analyzing HRV and the ratio of LF/HF with ECG signal.

Performance of deep learning approaches for detection and classification of ceramic tile defects,2023,"['Deep learning', 'Classification', 'Ceramic tile images', 'VGG model', 'CNN.']",,"Ceramic tiles are in high demand in the infrastructure and building development industries due to their low cost, ease ofinstallation, maintenance, moisture resistance, and availability in a broad range of colors, textures, and sizes. Automatedfacilities, which produce hundreds of tiles in every segment, require a tremendous volume of output. Because of the largenumber of tiles produced and the frequency with which they are produced, it is impossible to manually examine them forfaults, necessitating the use of a rapid, efficient, and reliable automated process. However, while the process of detecting flawsand categorizing them (or classification) is not as efficient as it might be, recent advances in computing technology,mathematical modeling, and high-resolution picture capture equipment have given rise to new prospects in the subject. Manykinds of literature on using these systems for the same goal are currently accessible. Deep learning is a type of artificialintelligence that helps people makes decisions. In production applications, image detection of faulty Ceramic Tile Surfaces isa critical skill. Deep learning is now being studied for its potential application in automated defect identification. As a result,we propose Deep Learning approaches that take advantage of the transform domain properties of the tiles image.

However, such images lack 3D spatial information aboutthe scene, which is very useful for scientists, surveyors, engineers, and even robots. To tackle such problems,depth maps are generated for respective image planes. Depth maps or depth images are single image metric whichcarries the information in three-dimensional axes, i.e., xyz coordinates, where z is the object’s distance from cameraaxes. For many applications, including augmented reality, object tracking, segmentation, scene reconstruction,distance measurement, autonomous navigation, and autonomous driving, depth estimation is a fundamental task.Much of the work has been done to calculate depth maps. We reviewed the status of depth map estimation usingdifferent techniques from several papers, study areas, and models applied over the last 20 years.

Multi-head de-noising autoencoder-based multi-task model for fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings under various speed conditions,2023,"['fault diagnosis', 'various speed conditions', 'de-noising autoencoder', 'multi-head CNN', 'multi-task learning']",,"Fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings (REBs), one type of essential mechanical element, has been actively researched; recent research has focused on the use of deep-learning-based approaches. However, conventional deep-learning-based fault-diagnosis approaches are vulnerable to various operating speeds, which greatly affect the vibration characteristics of the system studied. To solve this problem, previous deep-learning-based studies have usually been carried out by increasing the complexity of the model or diversifying the task of the model. Still, limitations remain because the reason of increasing complexity is unclear and the roles of multiple tasks are not well-defined. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-head de-noising autoencoder-based multi-task model for robust diagnosis of REBs under various speed conditions. The proposed model employs a multi-head de-noising autoencoder and multi-task learning strategy to robustly extract features under various speed conditions, while effectively disentangling the speed- and fault-related information. In this research, we evaluate the proposed method using the signals measured from bearing experiments under various speed conditions. The results of the evaluation study show that the proposed method outperformed conventional methods, especially when the training and test datasets have large discrepancies in their operating conditions."

If we consider that Trump became the American Republican presidential candidate at that time, these misogynistic linguistic elements seemed to be of little importance to Trump's supporters.Trump projected a smart image in terms of his linguistic strategy; justifying himself through the use of membership categorization, rhetorical use of mitigation and lexical cohesion such as anaphoric, exophoric references, and repetition as a rhetorical device. In his remarks, he showed a hierarchical structure on the importance of misogyny. For him and his supporters, the misogynistic characteristics seemed to be less important than other important issues facing the United States.

In this study, we identified seed coat patterns of Allium seeds using five deep learning methods namely, CNN, AlexNet, GoogleNet, ResNet50, and VGG16 for the first time. Selected images of seed coat patterns from over 100 Allium species reported in previously published literature and data from our samples were classified into seven types of anticlinal (irregular curved, irregular curved to nearly straight, straight, S, U, UO, and omega) and five types of periclinal walls (granule, small verruca, large verruca, marginal verruca, and verrucate verruca). The results revealed that GoogleNet and VGG16 achieved the highest classifi cation accuracy of 90.4% for the anticlinal wall, and VGG16 achieved the highest classification accuracy of 98.1% for the periclinal wall. Moreover, more than three, four, and five methods were combined, and their performance was investigated. Combining more than three methods was the most advantageous. The models achieved a suitable anticlinal wall classification using GoogleNet and periclinal wall classification using VGG16. In conclusion, using the machine-based method, we studied the seed coat of species of Allium on our own samples to see if the results of the machine-based method match with the human based classification."

A novel MobileNet with selective depth multiplier to compromise complexity and accuracy,2023,"['convolutional neural network', 'depth multiplier', 'depthwise separable convolution', 'MobileNet', 'selective depth multiplier']",,"In the last few years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated good performance while solving various computer vision problems. However, since CNNs exhibit high computational complexity, signal processing is performed on the server side. To reduce the computational complexity of CNNs for edge computing, a lightweight algorithm, such as a MobileNet, is proposed. Although MobileNet is lighter than other CNN models, it commonly achieves lower classification accuracy. Hence, to find a balance between complexity and accuracy, additional hyperparameters for adjusting the size of the model have recently been proposed. However, significantly increasing the number of parameters makes models dense and unsuitable for devices with limited computational resources. In this study, we propose a novel MobileNet architecture, in which the number of parameters is adaptively increased according to the importance of feature maps. We show that our proposed network achieves better classification accuracy with fewer parameters than the conventional MobileNet."

Although image-based and radar-based traffic accident detection systems are commonly employed, they have several drawbacks, including the need to secure the camera's field of view, a high rate of false alarms, and a lengthy detection time. Using a real-time acoustic surveillance system and the classification algorithm via Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), this article proposes several methods for identifying abnormal situations, such as a car crash or tire skid sound, to overcome the limitations of existing methods.

They cause loss of vegetation and affect ecosystem changes depending on their intensityand occurrence. Ecosystem changes, in turn, affect wildfire occurrence, causing secondary damage. Thus,accurate estimation of the areas affected by wildfires is fundamental. Satellite remote sensing is used forforest fire detection because it can rapidly acquire topographic and meteorological information aboutthe affected area after forest fires. In addition, deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neuralnetworks (CNN) and transformer models show high performance for more accurate monitoring of fireburntregions. To date, the application of deep learning models has been limited, and there is a scarcityof reports providing quantitative performance evaluations for practical field utilization. Hence, this studyemphasizes a comparative analysis, exploring performance enhancements achieved through both modelselection and data design. This study examined deep learning models for detecting wildfire-damagedareas using Landsat 8 satellite images in California. Also, we conducted a comprehensive comparisonand analysis of the detection performance of multiple models, such as U-Net and High-ResolutionNetwork-Object Contextual Representation (HRNet-OCR). Wildfire-related spectral indices such asnormalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized burn ratio (NBR) were used as inputchannels for the deep learning models to reflect the degree of vegetation cover and surface moisturecontent. As a result, the mean intersection over union (mIoU) was 0.831 for U-Net and 0.848 for HRNet-OCR, showing high segmentation performance. The inclusion of spectral indices alongside the base wavelength bands resulted in increased metric values for all combinations, affirming that the augmentationof input data with spectral indices contributes to the refinement of pixels. This study can be applied toother satellite images to build a recovery strategy for fire-burnt areas."

With our dexterous glove device, 1D acceleration signal can be measured from each finger and decomposed to time-divided frequency components via wavelet transformation, which is known as scalogram as image-like format. To feed-forward the scalogram with single 2D, convolutional neural networks allows the gesture having temporality to be easily recognized without any complex system such as RNN, LSTM, or spatio-temporal feature as 3D CNN, etc. To classify the image with general input dimension of image RGB channels, we numerically reconstruct fifteen scalograms into one RGB image with various representation methods. In experiments, we employ the off-the-shelf model, EfficientNetV2 small-to-large model as an image classification model with fine-tuning. To evaluate our system, we bulid our custom bicycle hand signals as dynamic gesture dataset under our transformation system, and then qualitatively compare the reconstruction method with matrix representation methods.

The first study visually examines the inference process of two distinct models trained on positively biased and negatively biased data, respectively, to observe differences. The second study investigates captions generated by image captioning models trained on four datasets with different ratios of positive and negative biases in emotion.Background: As AI development accelerates with diverse and large-scale data, concerns about biases raising erroneous learning and reduced prediction accuracy have emerged. Data biases cause unfair outcomes related to race, gender, or ideology.Method: The first study explores the influence of emotion data bias on a CNN model's inference process, revealing concentration patterns for positively and negatively biased emotion data using LayerCAM. The second quantitatively analyzes bias influence on outcomes using an image captioning model trained on differently biased datasets. We quantitatively analyze the relationship between the generated captions and the datasets in terms of the Sentiment Intensity Analysis (SIA) values.Results: Divergent inference processes were observed in the first study, showing that the focused regions of the models were different by different biases in emotion data trained.

Enhancing Acute Kidney Injury Prediction through Integration of Drug Features in Intensive Care Units,2023,"['Acute Kidney Injury', 'Healthcare', 'EHR', 'Drug Embeddings']",,"The relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) prediction and nephrotoxic drugs, or drugs that adversely affect kidney function, is one that has yet to be explored in the critical care setting. One contributing factor to this gap in research is the limited investigation of drug modalities in the intensive care unit (ICU) context, due to the challenges of processing prescription data into the corresponding drug representations and a lack in the comprehensive understanding of these drug representations. This study addresses this gap by proposing a novel approach that leverages patient prescription data as a modality to improve existing models for AKI prediction. We base our research on Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, extracting the relevant patient prescription information and converting it into the selected drug representation for our research, the extended-connectivity fingerprint (ECFP). Furthermore, we adopt a unique multimodal approach, developing machine learning models and 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) applied to clinical drug representations, establishing a procedure which has not been used by any previous studies predicting AKI. The findings showcase a notable improvement in AKI prediction through the integration of drug embeddings and other patient cohort features. By using drug features represented as ECFP molecular fingerprints along with common cohort features such as demographics and lab test values, we achieved a considerable improvement in model performance for the AKI prediction task over the baseline model which does not include the drug representations as features, indicating that our distinct approach enhances existing baseline techniques and highlights the relevance of drug data in predicting AKI in the ICU setting."

To calculate the accurate gamma index pass rate, a pixel spacing of less than 1/3 of the criteria distance is required. Film is providing fne resolution for measuring dose distribution several disadvantages have led to a preference for 2D array detectors. However, 2D array detectors have lower spatial resolution, which requires improvement to calculate the accurate gamma pass rate. Interpolation methods have traditionally been used for this purpose. While some researchers have made eforts to increase the acquired spatial resolution, the limitation of having to fx the gantry at 0 degrees for irradiation. To overcome this limitation, this study applies super-resolution using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to dose distribution acquisition.

To train the model, the required dose distribution was obtained from the publicly available Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Radiomics data set contained in The Cancer Image Archive (TCIA). This data set consists of computed tomography (CT) images and the radiotherapy structure set (RTSTRUCT), which contains location information for tumours and critical organs.To evaluate the performance of the trained model, the PSNR and SSIM were compared for dose distributions obtained from the treatment planning system (TPS), those with super-resolution applied using ESPCN, and those with bi-linear and bi-cubic interpolation. The PSNR values for ESPCN, bi-linear and bi-cubic were 36.34, 32.57 and 34.84, respectively, while the corresponding SSIM values were 0.9496, 0.9470 and 0.9566.

To prevent this, traffic signs are often used to alert drivers by indicating the height of vehicles that can enter the area. However, drivers may not see the signs due to poor road maintenance and poor visibility. Therefore, a device that automatically generates information about these height restrictions is needed, which can be obtained automatically by automatically classifying vehicle information. In this paper, we aim to prevent accidents on bridges and parking lots by automatically identifying the height of vehicles by automatically classifying vehicle information. We designed a deep learning model based on convolutional neural network (CNN) for automatic classification of vehicle models. We used TensorFlow as the design framework and created three classification classes: bus, passenger car, and motorcycle. The dataset used was a total of 1500 images. For performance evaluation, we first calculated the chaos matrix and used it to calculate precision and recall, and finally calculated the performance metric, F1-score. F1-score is the fairest performance metric and we obtained 0.964, 0.902, and 0.926 for bus, car, and motorcycle, respectively, with an average performance of 0.933."
Cross‑domain health status assessment of three‑phase inverters using improved DANN,2023,"['Health status assessment', 'Transfer learning', 'Deep residual network', 'Domain adversarial neural network']",,"Information and large number of fault labels are required to achieve intelligent health status assessment of three-phase inverters. However, the current signals of inverters cannot be sufficiently collected since open-circuit faults (OCFs) occur briefly, which makes it difficult to determine the OCF mode of the various power switches. A transfer learning model that effectively uses a small amount of sample data to achieve domain adaptation is proposed to address this problem. First, collected fault-sensitive signals are subjected to a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to obtain two-dimensional image data with more abundant fault feature information. Second, the source domain and target domain features are projected into the same feature space through a domain adversarial neural network (DANN) to achieve multi-domain feature extraction and adaptation. Then, in the feature extraction module of the DANN, the deep residual network (Resnet) structure is used to replace the typical convolutional neural network (CNN) structure. Finally, an intelligent diagnosis network is used to identify the health status of the inverter samples under variable conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed model can accurately and effectively realize the cross-domain health assessment of three-phase inverters in the case of small samples. The accuracy of the proposed model is better than that of other classical transfer learning models."

The deep structure of UDCNN is used to extract the features of text vector classification. The LSTM stores historical information to extract the context dependency of long texts, and word embedding is introduced to convert the text into low-dimensional vectors.

The existing breach assessment, which contains one paragraph, was more specifically divided into a new format that included revision content, review content, and review comment. The revised content in the new format is categorized by the purpose of personal information processing, the subject of the information, the personal information processor, and four types of personal information (general personal information, unique identification information, sensitive information, and video information). These were extracted from revision proposals using a named entity recognizer. This named entity recognizer was fine-tuned from the xlm-roberta-large pre-trained language model to identify a total of eight named entities. The micro F1-score for the eight named entities was 0.707, and among them, the micro F1-score for the four types of personal information was 0.737. The review contents in the new format, which includes legal compliance, the necessity of personal information processing, the inevitability of business processing, and the safety of information management, employs the intent classification technique, which is widely used in chatbots, and generates over 140 review opinions using slot tagging. The review opinions in the new format start by determining the breach status for each personal information. The breach determination classifier was trained on a CNN + Fasttext classification model, achieving a micro F1-score of 0.91. Despite the newly subdivided and revised format, the introduction of this AI system showed a significant enhancement in task efficiency, supporting the rapid execution of breach evaluations."

Intelligent Operation Monitoring of an Ultra-Precision CNC Machine Tool Using Energy Data,2023,"['Intelligent operation monitoring', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Convolutional neural network', 'Energy consumption monitoring']",,"Ultra-precision CNC machine tools play a significant role in the machining of precision dies and molds, optics, consumer electronics, etc., Due to the nature of ultra-precision machining, a subtle change in process condition, machine anomalies, etc. may significantly influence the machining outcome. Hence, continuous monitoring of the equipment’s operation is required to better understand the variations associated with the process and the machine. The conventional monitoring platform requires comprehensive data analysis using multiple sensors, and controller data to detect, diagnose, and prognose machine and process conditions. This increases the cost and complexity of installing a monitoring platform. The energy consumption data contains valuable information that could be potentially used to identify machine and process variations. The information can also be used to develop potential energy-saving strategies in an effort towards Green Manufacturing. This paper proposes an intelligent energy monitoring method using a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) to effortlessly and accurately obtain the working status information of the machine with minimal retrofitting. The 1D-CNN uses the energy consumption data to determine the equipment’s operation status by identifying the working components and the feed rate of the moving axis. The hyper-parameters of the developed model were optimized to improve the prediction accuracy. The paper also compares different Deep Learning and Machine Learning algorithms to gauge their effective performance in this application. Finally, the model with the highest accuracy was validated on a 5-axis ultra-precision CNC machine tool. Results show that 1D-CNN performs better than multi-layer neural networks and machine learning algorithms in processing time-series datasets. The classification accuracy of 1D-CNN on the detection of operation status and feed rate of each axis can reach 95.7 and 91.4%, respectively. Further studies are currently in progress to improve prediction accuracy of the model, and to detect subtle changes in energy consumption which would enable identification of the machine and process anomalies."

To reduce the collision risk between vehicles and pedestrians, we need to identify the risky situations and find the factors affecting it. We propose a method identifying the potential collision risks of vehicle-pedestrian interactions near crosswalks by applying computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques on videos. First, we employ a mask R-CNN model and transformation matrix in OpenCV to recognize the precise positions of the road users (e.g. vehicle and pedestrian) in orthogonal view. Next, we track their trajectories using the modified Kalman filter method. After extracting their interactions from trajectories of road users, we analyze their potential collision risks near crosswalks. In our experiments, we collected the video footage from 9 cameras in Osan City, tracked road users in videos, and analyzed the potential collision risks between them. On this video, the accuracy of road user detection was about 90% for both the vehicles and pedestrians when the distance tolerance is 50cm. For the tracking accuracy, our modified Kalman filter outperformed the threshold and minimum distance method by 3%. In analysis part, we elicited the valuable information that the vehicle speed is high on a wide road without a speed camera and the pedestrian safety margin is small on unsignalized crosswalks. We further observed that around 50% of cars do not stop before crosswalk when pedestrians cross the un-signalized crosswalk without having special warning signs such as red urethane road pavement and school zone marking on road."

A comparative study on the implementation of deep learning algorithms for detection of hepatic necrosis in toxicity studies,2023,['Deep learning · Hepatic necrosis · Histopathology · Image analysis · Toxicology'],,"Deep learning has recently become one of the most popular methods of image analysis. In non-clinical studies, several tissue slides are generated to investigate the toxicity of a test compound. These are converted into digital image data using a slide scanner, which is then studied by researchers to investigate abnormalities, and the deep learning method has been started to adopt in this study. However, comparative studies evaluating different deep learning algorithms for analyzing abnormal lesions are scarce. In this study, we applied three algorithms, SSD, Mask R-CNN, and DeepLabV3+, to detect hepatic necrosis in slide images and determine the best deep learning algorithm for analyzing abnormal lesions. We trained each algorithm on 5750 images and 5835 annotations of hepatic necrosis including validation and test, augmented with 500 image tiles of 448 × 448 pixels. Precision, recall, and accuracy were calculated for each algorithm based on the prediction results of 60 test images of 2688 × 2688 pixels. The two segmentation algorithms, DeepLabV3+ and Mask R-CNN, showed over 90% of accuracy (0.94 and 0.92, respectively), whereas SSD, an object detection algorithm, showed lower accuracy. The trained DeepLabV3+ outperformed all others in recall while also successfully separating hepatic necrosis from other features in the test images. It is important to localize and separate the abnormal lesion of interest from other features to investigate it on a slide level. Therefore, we suggest that segmentation algorithms are more appropriate than object detection algorithms for use in the pathological analysis of images in non-clinical studies."

Segmentation algorithm can be used for detecting hepatic fibrosis in SD rat,2023,"['Digital pathology', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Liver fibrosis', 'Cirrhosis', 'NDMA', 'NASH', 'Image segmentation']",,"Background: Liver fibrosis is an early stage of liver cirrhosis. As a reversible lesion before cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer, it has been a target for drug discovery. Many antifibrotic candidates have shown promising results in experimental animal models; however, due to adverse clinical reactions, most antifibrotic agents are still preclinical. Therefore, rodent models have been used to examine the histopathological differences between the control and treatment groups to evaluate the efficacy of anti-fibrotic agents in non-clinical research. In addition, with improvements in digital image analysis incorporating artificial intelligence (AI), a few researchers have developed an automated quantification of fibrosis. However, the performance of multiple deep learning algorithms for the optimal quantification of hepatic fibrosis has not been evaluated. Here, we investigated three different localization algorithms, mask R-CNN, DeepLabV3+, and SSD, to detect hepatic fibrosis.Results: 5750 images with 7503 annotations were trained using the three algorithms, and the model performance was evaluated in large-scale images and compared to the training images. The results showed that the precision values were comparable among the algorithms. However, there was a gap in the recall, leading to a difference in model accuracy. The mask R-CNN outperformed the recall value (0.93) and showed the closest prediction results to the annotation for detecting hepatic fibrosis among the algorithms. DeepLabV3+ also showed good performance; however, it had limitations in the misprediction of hepatic fibrosis as inflammatory cells and connective tissue. The trained SSD showed the lowest performance and was limited in predicting hepatic fibrosis compared to the other algorithms because of its low recall value (0.75).Conclusions: We suggest it would be a more useful tool to apply segmentation algorithms in implementing AI algorithms to predict hepatic fibrosis in non-clinical studies."
파편 탐지 성능 향상을 위한 딥러닝 초해상도화 효과 분석,2023,[],,"The Arena Fragmentation Test(AFT) is designed to analyze warhead performance by measuring fragmentation data. In order to evaluate the results of the AFT, a set of AFT images are captured by high-speed cameras. To detect objects in the AFT image set, ResNet-50 based Faster R-CNN is used as a detection model. However, because of the low resolution of the AFT image set, a detection model has shown low performance. To enhance the performance of the detection model, Super-resolution(SR) methods are used to increase the AFT image set resolution. To this end, The Bicubic method and three SR models: ZSSR, EDSR, and SwinIR are used. The use of SR images results in an increase in the performance of the detection model. While the increase in the number of pixels representing a fragment flame in the AFT images improves the Recall performance of the detection model, the number of pixels representing noise also increases, leading to a slight decreases in Precision performance. Consequently, the F1 score is increased by up to 9 %, demonstrating the effectiveness of SR in enhancing the performance of the detection model."

Themodel performance was compared to that of experts in geriatric dentistry, and the experts and the system strongly agreed onthe recommended therapeutic plans (kappa value = 0.905). Conclusions: This research was the first phase of the developmentof a CDSS to recommend geriatric dental treatment. The proposed system, when integrated into the clinical workflow, is expectedto provide general practitioners with expert-level decision support in geriatric dental care."
A Model Transfer Learning Based Fault Diagnosis Method for Chemical Processes With Small Samples,2023,"['Convolutional neural network', 'fault diagnosis', 'generative adversarial network', 'small samples', 'transfer learning.']",,"Traditional fault diagnosis methods relies on sufficient fault samples, but it is unrealistic since the fault is a low possibility event in real industrial scenes. To address the above issue, this paper proposed a fault diagnosis method for chemical processes with small samples. First, a data self-generating-based transfer learning (DSGTL) method is presented to expand the fault samples. The characteristic of fault data is learned by adversarial relation and transferred to the generated data. Moreover, a model-based transfer learning strategy is adopted to improve the robustness of the proposed method to the quality of generated data. Second, the sample reconstruction-based convolutional neural network (SR-CNN) is proposed which adaptively extracts features from both spatial domain and time domain and identifies the fault type of industrial process with small samples. Finally, the experimental result of the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process proves the validity and the feasibility of the proposed method."
Developing a Solution to Improve Road Safety Using Multiple Deep Learning Techniques,2023,"['Meteorological Data', 'Orthophoto Image Data', 'Road Surface Data', 'Deep Learning']",,"The number of traffic accidents caused by wet or icy road surface conditions is on the rise every year. Car crashes in such bad road conditions can increase fatalities and serious injuries. Historical data (from the year 2016 to the year 2020) on weather-related traffic accidents show that the fatality rates are fairly high in Korea. This requires accurate prediction and identification of hazardous road conditions. In this study, a forecasting model is developed to predict the chances of traffic accidents that can occur on roads affected by weather and road surface conditions. Multiple deep learning algorithms taking into account AlexNet and 2D-CNN are employed. Data on orthophoto images, automatic weather systems, automated synoptic observing systems, and road surfaces are used for training and testing purposes. The orthophotos images are pre-processed before using them as input data for the modeling process. The procedure involves image segmentation techniques as well as the Z-Curve index. Results indicate that there is an acceptable performance of prediction such as 65% for dry, 46% for moist, and 33% for wet road conditions. The overall accuracy of the model is 53%. The findings of the study may contribute to developing comprehensive measures for enhancing road safety."
An Intelligent Fault Diagnosis Method for Imbalanced Nuclear Power Plant Data Based on Generative Adversarial Networks,2023,"['Fault diagnosis', 'Imbalanced data', 'Generative adversarial network', 'Multivariate time series', 'Recurrent neural network']",,"In the fault diagnosis problem, where sample data of fault cases are imbalanced, data generation and expansion are performed based on a generative adversarial network to obtain balanced data for training. Combining a gated recurrent neural network and an autoencoder model, the GRU-BEGAN model for generating multiple time series data is proposed for the intelligent fault diagnosis of imbalanced nuclear power plant data. To guarantee the consistency of the probability distribution between the generated data and real data, the K-L losses are included as a part of the loss function of the generator. At the same time, the potential feature vector of the real data obtained by the discriminator encoder is introduced as a hidden variable in the generator, and the similarity between the generated data and the real data is controlled by introducing the hidden variables according to the probability to make the generated data diverse. For the imbalanced fault dataset of the nuclear power plant thermal–hydraulic systems, the proposed GRU-BEGAN model is used to expand the original data to obtain a balanced state. Then, a 1D-CNN fault diagnosis model is established based on a convolutional neural network. The experimental results show that the fault diagnosis accuracy of the total test data is improved by 1.45% after data expansion, and the fault diagnosis accuracy of the minority sample is improved by 6.8% after data expansion."
Development of robust fault diagnosis model for variable situations in robotic spot-welding (RSW) process based on transfer learning,2023,['· Vehicle production system · Welding quality control · Data-driven approach · Artificial intelligence · Prognostics and health management'],,"A key component of vehicle production automation is an industrial robot, and the robotic spot-welding (RSW) process is crucial due to more than 5000 spot-welds per vehicle.Due to the large number of welds, the quality of each weld must be adequately monitored and controlled; therefore, an automatic diagnostic system is required. In this paper, a robust fault diagnostic system is developed and evaluated for variable RSW process situations. Among the numerous RSW defects, electrode tip wear has been selected as a significant abnormal state that can lead to undersized welds. In addition, the thickness of the welding specimen is selected as a variable situation, and three thickness values — 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 mm — are considered as the variable situations. On the basis of 1D convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN) and transfer learning (TL) methods, a robust diagnostic model is established. The diagnostic accuracy is then used to compare and evaluate the performance of the TL-based models."
딥러닝 기반 일상 생활 및 낙상 위험도 예측,2023,"['위험도 예측', '낙상', '일상 생활', '딥러닝', '데이터 증강', 'Risk prediction', 'Fall', 'Activity of daily living', 'Deep learning', 'Data augmentation']",,"Predicting fall risk is necessary for rescue and accident prevention in the elderly. In this study, deep learning regression models were used to predict the acceleration sum vector magnitude (SVM) peak value, which represents the risk of a fall. Twenty healthy adults (aged 22.0±1.9 years, height 164.9±5.9 cm, weight 61.4±17.1 kg) provided data for 14 common daily life activities (ADL) and 11 falls using IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors (Movella Dot, Netherlands) at the S2. The input data includes information from 0.7 to 0.2 seconds before the acceleration SVM peak, encompassing 6-axis IMU data, as well as acceleration SVM and angular velocity SVM, resulting in a total of 8 feature vectors used to model training. Data augmentations were applied to solve data imbalances. The data was split into a 4 : 1 ratio for training and testing. The models were trained using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The deep learning model utilized 1D-CNN and LSTM. The model with data augmentation exhibited lower error values in both MAE (1.19 g) and MSE (2.93 g²). Low-height falls showed lower predicted acceleration peak values, while ADLs like jumping and sitting showed higherpredicted values, indicating higher risks."
Instance segmentation with pyramid integrated context for aerial objects,2023,"['Aerial object segmentation', 'Pyramid integrated context', 'Local aggregation feature pyramid networks', 'Context information', 'Feature enhancement']",,"Aerial objects are more challenging to segment than normal objects, which are usually smaller and have less textural detail. In the process of segmentation, target objects are easily omitted and misdetected, which is problematic. To alleviate these issues, we propose local aggregation feature pyramid networks (LAFPNs) and pyramid integrated context modules (PICMs) for aerial object segmentation. First, using an LAFPN, while strengthening the deep features, the extent to which low-level features interfere with high-level features is reduced, and numerous dense and small aerial targets are prevented from being mistakenly detected as a whole. Second, the PICM uses global information to guide local features, which enhances the network's comprehensive understanding of an entire image and reduces the missed detection of small aerial objects due to insufficient texture information. We evaluate our network with the MS COCO dataset using three categories: airplanes, birds, and kites. Compared with Mask R-CNN, our network achieves performance improvements of 1.7%, 4.9%, and 7.7% in terms of the AP metrics for the three categories. Without pretraining or any postprocessing, the segmentation performance of our network for aerial objects is superior to that of several recent methods based on classic algorithms."
딥러닝을 활용한 딸기 생육지표 인식,2023,"['Deep Learning', 'Monitoring System', 'Object Detection', 'Strawberry Detection']",,"As the risks of securing stable food resources increase due to climate change and a decrease in the agricultural workforce, agricultural technologies are being developed to address this issue. In particular, many strawberries are grown in South Korea and require accurate and fast monitoring technology for stable profits. The reason is that many agricultural tasks are required depending on the cultivation period. This study attempted to find a suitable model for detecting the strawberry growth index during the reproductive growth period using an RGB image and deep learning. Among algorithms used for training, the YOLO v5-Large algorithm showed an mAP50 of 0.66 and FPS of 89.29 in the object detection results for a total of six classes (flowers, fruits, etc.). In addition, the Mask R-CNN algorithm's performance was similar with an mAP50 of 0.59, but the FPS was decreased to 26.04. The model that showed high performance to detect the growth index can be used in monitoring technology that supports decision making for appropriate resources and manpower input during growth. Future studies will improve the performance of detection."
Refinement Module 기반 Three-Scale 보행자 검출 기법,2023,"['Deep Learning', 'Pedestrian Detection', 'Refinement Module']",,"Pedestrian detection is used to effectively detect pedestrians in various situations based on deep learning. Pedestrian detection has difficulty detecting pedestrians due to problems such as camera performance, pedestrian description, height, and occlusion. Even in the same pedestrian, performance in detecting them can differ according to the height of the pedestrian. The height of general pedestrians encompasses various scales, such as those of infants, adolescents, and adults, so when the model is applied to one group, the extraction of data becomes inaccurate. Therefore, this study proposed a pedestrian detection method that fine-tunes the pedestrian area by Refining Layer and Feature Concatenation to consider various heights of pedestrians. Through this, the score and location value for the pedestrian area were finely adjusted. Experiments on four types of test data demonstrate that the proposed model achieves 2-5% higher average precision (AP) compared to Faster R-CNN and DRPN."
CCA 방법의 다중특징융합을 이용한 딥러닝 기반 음성 감정 인식,2023,"['Speech emotion recognition', 'human-computer interactions', 'deep learning', 'canonical correlation analysis', 'feature level fusion']",,"Speech emotion recognition is a technology that identifies emotional states in human speech and plays a crucial role in enhancing Human Computer Interactions (HCI) more naturally and effectively. This technology supports the accurate understanding and appropriate response to human emotions through AI. In this study, we compare and analyze the performance of a speech emotion recognition model based on deep learning that utilizes the fusion of multiple features from speech signals. Various features such as bark-spectrum, mel-spectrum, Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficient (MFCC), and GammaTone Cepstrum Coefficient (GTCC) are extracted from the speech signal. Among these, two types of features are fused based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) methods to obtain a new single feature vector, which is then used as the input for the one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) emotion recognition model. This fused feature contributes to enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of emotion recognition, and its performance is analyzed in comparison to the case of using only each feature. The performance of the model is evaluated using the AI-hub emotion classification dataset and the Korean speech emotion state classification dataset constructed by Chosun University. For both datasets, the multiple features level fusion through the CCA method improved the performance of voice emotion recognition compared to using single features."
