The diagnosis typically involves assessing symptoms, conducting physical examinations, performing urine tests, and utilizing radiological imaging. Artificial intelligence models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in detecting stones. However, due to insufficient datasets, the performance of these models has not reached a level suitable for practical application. Consequently, this study introduces a vision transformer (ViT)-based pipeline for detecting urinary stones, using computed tomography images with augmentation.Methods: The super-resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) model was employed to enhance the resolution of a given dataset, followed by data augmentation using CycleGAN. Subsequently, the ViT model facilitated the detection and classification of urinary tract stones. The model’s performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall as metrics.Results: The deep learning model based on ViT showed superior performance compared to other existing models. Furthermore, the performance increased with the size of the backbone model.Conclusions: The study proposes a way to utilize medical data to improve the diagnosis of urinary tract stones. SRCNN was used for data preprocessing to enhance resolution, while CycleGAN was utilized for data augmentation. The ViT model was utilized for stone detection, and its performance was validated through metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the F1 score. It is anticipated that this research will aid in the early diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract stones, thereby improving the efficiency of medical personnel."

A Research on the Application of Face Recognition Algorithm  Based on Convolutional Model and Transformer Model in  Community Monitoring System,2023,"['facial recognition', 'Vision Transformer', 'ultra-lightweight.', '얼굴식별', '비전 트랜스포머', '울트라 라이트웨이트']",,"The promotion of intelligent security community construction has greatly enhanced the intelligence and safety of residential areas. In order to further establish a security-oriented community, this paper proposes the utilization of facial recognition based on community surveillance footage to identify suspicious individuals. To address the difficulties in capturing facial images caused by factors such as low pixel resolution and varying shooting angles in surveillance footage, the following optimization strategies are proposed in this paper : Firstly, a lightweight global search facial detection network is designed based on convolutional modules and Vision Transformer modules. The Vision Transformer module is introduced to enhance the global retrieval capability of the network. Secondly, the structure of the Vision Transformer module is optimized by adding pooling layers in the feature block extraction and segmentation stage to reduce the number of module parameters. The feature blocks are mapped and computed with the feature maps to improve the corresponding feature correlation. Thirdly, in the face alignment stage, an Anchor Free mechanism is adopted to generate elliptical face localization regions for more accurate fitting of faces and reducing interference from other background information in the final identity recognition stage. Finally, the similarity between faces is calculated using Euclidean space distance to determine corresponding personnel identities. Through relevant experiments and tests on the self-built facial identity dataset in this paper's residential surveillance system, the proposed facial detection network achieves an average improvement of 3.11% in detection accuracy compared to other detection networks, reaching 97.19%. In terms of facial identity recognition, the designed model achieves an average improvement of 3.43% with a recognition accuracy of 95.84."

Previous child behavior analysis models transform the pose estimation model into a 3D coordinate system and use a classification technique based on the RRT(Rapidly Explore Random Tree) algorithm. However, when RRT initial 3D coordinate inputs are insufficient, we cannot obtain optimal classification results. Also, the pose estimation and classification model will be processed as a single stream, resulting in delays in simultaneous analysis of multiple people. The proposed model separates spatial and temporal features in order to enable the training of many feature information, and, for the association between those features, the Transformer model is changed to operate on graph basis. This training of separated features is processed in parallel by creating two GPU-based streams. Regarding the analysis of children's abnormal behavior, the proposed model shows a 10% improvement of accuracy based on F1-Score, and 7FPS improvement in analysis speed over the previous models."

In this study, we compared and evaluated You Only Look Once Version 7 (YOLOv7), the most widely used deep learning model for real-time object detection, and detection tansformer (DETR), a transformer-based model, using underwater images for benthic marine invertebrates in the coasts of South Korea. YOLOv7 showed a mean average precision at 0.5 (mAP@0.5) of 0.899, and DETR showed an mAP@0.5 of 0.862, which implies that YOLOv7 is more appropriate for object detection of various sizes. This is because YOLOv7 generates the bounding boxes at multiple scales that can help detect small objects. Both models had a processing speed of more than 30 frames per second (FPS), so it is expected that real-time object detection from the images provided by divers and underwater drones will be possible. The proposed method can be used to prevent and restore damage to coastal fisheries ecosystems, such as rescuing invertebrate grazers and creating sea forests to prevent ocean desertification."

The primary objective involves comparing the surprisal values estimated from neural network language models like autoregressive and bidirectional language models to the reaction times of human when exposed to both metaphorical and literal sentences. Our secondary objective involves assessing the AI's comprehension of metaphors by utilizing the sensicality ratings generated by sophisticated ChatGPT. To achieve this, we used psycholinguistic methods, and adopted the experimental materials from Lai, Currana, and Menna (2009). We found the surprisal values estimated from the autoregressive language model demonstrate metaphor processing that closely resembles that of native speakers. Furthermore, ChatGPT's processing of conventional metaphorical sentences closely resembles its approach to literal sentences, mirroring the convergence observed in native speakers' ERP response to conventional metaphorical sentences and their alignment with that of literal sentences."

"Flexible Role Orientation, Employee Proactivity and Moderating effect of Transformational Leadership from a Motivated Information Processing Model Perspective",2023,"['individual proactivity', 'flexible role orientation', 'transformational leadership', 'prosocial motivation', 'proactive work performance']",,"Despite increasing importance of proactive employees, who take initiatives to create change that benefit organizations, the understanding of the underlying motivational mechanisms behind how distal proactivity predisposition unfolds and results in the enactment of proactive work behaviors is less well-understood. Examining the interaction of individual characteristic and situation provides better understanding of the motivational mechanisms behind how employee proactivity unfolds. Specifically, I drew from motivated information processing model to propose prosocial motivation as an important mediating mechanism, which ultimately determines proactive work behaviors. I further identified transformational leadership as an important situational factor that can promote individual proactivity among employees with low FRO. Using three-wave source data from 114 employees, the key findings are (1) FRO is positively related to proactive work performance through mediation of prosocial motivation; (2) consistent with trait activation theory, in the absence of transformational leadership, FRO had stronger indirect effect on proactivity via prosocial motivation. This implies that for employees with low FRO, transformational leaders can have a greater role to play in enhancing prosocial motivation, leading to subsequent proactive work behaviors. Hence, the findings underscore the importance of the interplay of person and situation in shaping individual’s motivation to engage in proactive work behaviors."

Recently, research using various deep learning models is underway to improve detection performance, but these detection models analyze the CAN message in the unit of traffic groups with a certain size and identify only whether an attack message exists in the group, so there is a limitation in that the detection models cannot identify which traffics are related with attacks.

ViViT 모델은입력 영상을 일정한 크기로 분할한 패치(patch)들을 생성하는데, 이 패치의 크기를 다르게 설정하여 모델을 학습한 결과 작은 패치 크기를 사용할수록 예측력이 좋아지는 것으로 나타났다. 또한이미지 처리 분야에서 사용되어온 CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) 구조에서 영상을 입력으로받는 3D CNN 모델과 예측 성능을 비교해본 결과 작은 패치 크기를 사용한 ViViT 모델의 성능이 더 우수한 것으로 나타났다.

However, it is difficult to accurately predict the yield of rice due to variable factors such as extreme climate change and various pests and diseases that change every year. In this study, images were collected several times during the growing season of rice through a multi-spectral sensor mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle, and rice yield was predicted using a deep learning algorithm. Multispectral images can be viewed as a kind of image data taken several times at regular intervals, and rice yield was predicted using the Video Vision Transformer (ViViT) model, which applies the Transformer structure to image computer vision among deep learning algorithms. The ViViT model generates patches by dividing the input image into a certain size, and as a result of learning the model by setting the size of these patches differently, it was found that the smaller the patch size, the better the predictive power. In addition, as a result of comparing prediction performance with a 3D CNN model that receives an image as an input in a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) structure used in the image processing field, it was found that the ViViT model using a small patch size performed better. As a result of visualizing the weight matrix of the ViViT model as a heat map, images taken in mid- to late August appear to be important in yield prediction, making it possible to predict yield about two months before rice harvest."
멀티헤드 어텐션 병렬화를 통한 트랜스포머 기반 객체추적 모델의 실행속도 향상,2023,"['Transformer', 'Multi-head attention', 'CSWinTT', 'Object tracking', 'Multi-threading']","최근 딥러닝 기반 객체추적 기술이 발전함에 따라 스포츠 경기 분석, 영상 보안, 증강현실 등 다양한 응용 분야에서 객체추적 기술이 사용되고 있다. 사용자들은 높은 객체추적 정확도뿐만 아니라 빠른 객체추적 속도에 따른 높은 QoS를 요구한다. 본 연구에서는 현재 객체추적 솔루션 중 최고로 꼽히는 트랜스포머기반 CSWinTT 모델의 객체추적 속도를 향상시킨다. 이 모델의 인코더 레이어 내 Multi-Head Attention(MHA)의 head연산들은 전체 트랜스포머 추론 과정에서 가장 많은 실행시간을 차지하고, 각 head들은 각각 다른 입력 값을 가지지만 직렬로 실행된다. 이를 개선하기 위하여 본 연구에서는 각각의 head연산들을 병렬적으로 실행시킨다. 병렬 실행을 위하여 하나의 모듈로 이루어진 MHA연산을 head 개수만큼 서브 모듈로 분리하고, 분리된 각각의 모듈을 멀티쓰레드 환경에서 실행한다. 이때 순수 Python 환경에서는 불가능한 멀티쓰레드 환경을 C++ 실행 환경으로 개선하여 가능하게 한다. 또한 각 쓰레드들이 비동기적으로 전달하는 커널들을 GPU 내부에서 최대한 동시에 실행될 수 있도록 한다. 다양한 실험을 통해 MHA 병렬실행의 효과를 확인한 결과, 추론정확도는 거의 동일하게 유지하면서 기존 실행환경에 비하여 인코더의 평균 실행시간은 56.8% 감소하였고, 평균 FPS는 63.3% 증가하였다.","With the recent advance of deep learning-based object tracking technology, it is being used in various application fields such as sports game analysis, video security, and augmented reality. Users require high object tracking accuracy as well as high QoS according to fast object tracking speed. In this study, we improve the object tracking speed of CSWinTT(transformer-based object-tracking model), which is currently considered as the best object tracking solution. The head operations of the Multi-Head Attention(MHA) in the encoder layer of this model occupy the most execution time in the entire inference procedure of the transformer. Each head has a different input value, but is executed in a serial manner. To overcome this, in this study, each head operation is executed in parallel. For parallel operation, the MHA consisting of one module is divided into sub-modules by the number of heads, and each separated sub-module is executed in a multi-threading environment. The pure Python environment does not guarantee a complete multi-threaded run. We thus improve to a C++ implementation environment to enable complete multi-threading. In addition, kernels transmitted asynchronously by each thread can be executed as concurrently as possible inside the GPU. As a result of checking the effect of MHA parallel execution through various experiments, the average execution time of the encoder decreased by 56.8% and the average FPS increased by 63.3% compared to the existing method while maintaining almost the same inference accuracy."

Recent research has focused on leveraging semantic segmentation to achieve automatic annotation of HD maps.

In this paper, we propose a novel semantic segmentation method for automatic HD map annotation. Our approach introduces a new encoder, known as the convolutional transformer hybrid encoder, to enhance the model's feature extraction capabilities. Additionally, we propose a multi-level fusion module that enables the model to aggregate different levels of detail and semantic information. Furthermore, we present a novel decoupled boundary joint decoder to improve the model's ability to handle the boundary between categories. To evaluate our method, we conducted experiments using the Bird's Eye View point cloud images dataset and Cityscapes dataset. Comparative analysis against state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that our model achieves the highest performance. Specifically, our model achieves an mIoU of 56.26%, surpassing the results of SegFormer with an mIoU of 1.47%. This innovative promises to significantly enhance the efficiency of HD map automatic annotation."

Recently, the deterioration of Vietnam's economic situation, including the US-China conflict, has caused a major downturn in Korean exporters along with the depreciation of the Korean Won. Therefore, this study aims to help manage their exchange rate risks by predicting the trends of the exchange rates of 8 major exporting countries based on Transformer-MAF, which has shown the highest performance in multivariate exchange rate prediction studies. However, the Transformer-MAF only conveys overall contextual information to the model through an single linear embedding module, and fails to emphasize the contextual information important for predicting the fluctuation trend of each country. Therefore, we proposed a Dilated Temporal Dependency Embedding module to the Transformer-MAF to enable effective multivariate long-term prediction based on various dependency relationships at adjacent time points. The proposed embedding module consists of a high-dimensional linear projection layer that can extract comprehensive contextual information of each country, and successive randomized masking and dilated conv blocks that deliver the various contextual information from different neighboring time points in each forward propagation. Experimental results show that the proposed model has the smallest standard deviation and outperforms all comparison models with a 0.75987 CRPSsum (±0.00202), provinging that effective multivariate exchange rate forecasting is possible with only a small increase in computation."

In this paper, the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) architecture was applied to the data of the M5 Competition, a famous forecasting competition, and the accuracy of the TFT-based forecasting method was compared with that of the DRFAM method, that had won the competition. The performance was evaluated for the sales data of CA_1 store in the Walmart dataset of the M5 Competition. The TFT models were trained with two data pools at the store level and category level, respectively, and the final forecast was calculated by arithmetically averaging the prediction results of the two models. As a result, the TFT-based method obtained better forecasts than the DRFAM method, which trained six LightGBM models with direct forecasting and recursive forecasting for three levels of data pools and predicted with the arithmetic average of the six trained models. It was found that the TFT-based method had sufficiently learned the relationship between variables and sales volumes in the time-series using the self-attention structure of TFT. While the direct and recursive forecasting models of the DRFAM method require 28 repeated calls for 28 days of forecasting, the TFT-based method can obtain 28 time-series forecasts with a single model call because of its multi-output structure. The proposed TFT-based forecasting method is expected to be applicable to various fields by providing faster and more accurate time-series forecasts."

The power quality is one of the important factors that affect the health status of facilities. If the quality of power is poor, many unnecessary costs are incurred. Therefore, it is necessary to predict this in advance and reduce the cost. In this paper, we propose a method that predicts the quality-related index value and detects the abnormal situation with the transformer-based long-term time series forecasting model. Here, we utilized DILATE loss function instead of MSE, due to the characteristics of the power quality time series data, the non-stationary, and the rapid change in value.

First, by capturing the thematic charac- teristics of the comments and categorizing them into anti-feminist and feminist topics in the context of gender conflict, we found that the collective identity of the male and female communities is aligned with the gender bias of the discourse around the GS25 crisis. In other words, the community‘s collective identity was reaffirmed and reinforced through comments, creating an exclusionary discourse with comments on issues of gender conflict. We also inferred attributions of responsibility for the crisis and explored how attributions played out in the community, finding that the narrative of holding companies accountable shifted to a narrative of gender confrontation and hate. The differentiation of attribution in gendered online communities transformed the corporate crisis into a conflict based on group identity. Furthermore, we found that the internal attribution of the cause of the crisis as a problem internalized by the company was buried in a narrative of gender conflict, and that the debate over responsibility for the GS25 has relatively muted. The findings of this study provide a basis for companies to formulate crisis response strategies, and contribute to the academic literature by analyzing how online collective identity conflicts relate to responsibility attribution."

In this study, Kingdon's multiple stream model is used as a vehicle to explore how various institutional and actor factors influence institutional formation through complex interactions.An analysis of the policy decision process that led to the adoption of the Stalking Act in 2021 was used to accomplish this. Four sub-themes are explored in this analysis: problem, policy, and political streams, along with the window of opportunity created by combining these three streams.The analysis results show characteristics of the decision-making process of the Stalking Act. First, there were two criminal cases that had a significant impact on the formation of the problem stream, namely the 'Nth Room' incident that occurred in 2020 and the Nowon-Gu murder case that occurred in early 2022. It was small organizations such as 'Tracker Team Flame' and 'Project Reset' that were the leading policy entrepreneurs in the problem stream.As a second point, the policy stream was established long before the problem stream was conceived. Korean Women's Hotline was the first organization to raise the issue of stalking damage and set the standard for the search for policy alternatives through activities such as collecting stalking statistics and arranging seminars. Among the other important elements of the policy stream is the proposal of a stalking law in the National Assembly. From 1999 to 2021, a total of 24 stalking legislation were proposed. Women's and Children's Human Rights Forum members, like In-soon Nam and Chun-sook Chung, contributed substantially to the search for policy alternatives by proposing stalking bills repeatedly. During debating stalking laws, criminal constitution requirements, behavior categories, and an article about crime not prosecuted against victims' objections were discussed.Third, in the political stream, the #MeToo movement increased public interest in gender violence, political parties revitalized legislative activity related to gender violence, the change of regime resulting from the presidential elections in 2017 and the general elections in 2020 created a favorable climate for enacting the Stalking Act. Key policy entrepreneurs in the political stream include President Moon Jae-in and members of the National Assembly. A consensus was formed between the political parties to enact the stalking law starting with the general election in April 2020, since all political parties pledged to legislate the stalking law.By combining these three streams, a window of opportunity was created that enabled stalking legislation to be enacted. In the final stage of the legislative process, a sudden institutional transformation took place in the legislation and judiciary committee in which the original draft of the Stalking Act was changed into a two-stage approach.The Stalking Act's process of decision-making demonstrates the utility of Kingdon's methodology, which explains the contingency and limited rationality of policy-making by analyzing complex and dynamic interactions between actors."

High‑frequency planar transformer optimal design and analysis,2023,"['DC–DC converter', 'Matrix transformer', 'Loss model', 'Winding structure optimization']",,"Due to the rapid development of modern industry, there is an increasing demand for isolated switching power supplies (SMPS) with a high efficiency and a high power density. Magnetic components, which occupy most of the converter volume, have been a key bottleneck in achieving high power density. This paper presents an optimal design method for high power density planar transformers. Applying the principle of flux cancellation, a matrix transformer that originally needed an independent magnetic core was integrated into a single magnetic core to reduce the volume of the core. Meanwhile, a loss model of the transformer is established, and an optimized design method of the winding structure is given according to that model to further reduce the winding loss of the transformer. Finally, an LLC converter with a resonant frequency of 1 MHz is designed to verify the practical performance of the proposed transformer."
Investigating a Hierarchical Inductive Bias in L2-textbook Seq2Seq Language Model,2023,"['neural language model', 'hierarchical inductive bias', 'linear inductive bias', 'question formation', 'passivization']",,"The relations between words in natural language are governed by hierarchical structures rather than linear ordering. In recent years, artificial neural network-based language models (LMs) have demonstrated impressive achievements in tasks related to sentence processing. These models benefit from pre-training, which helps enhance their performance. However, our comprehension of the precise syntactic knowledge acquired by these models during sentence processing remains somewhat restricted. This paper examines whether the L2-textbook Seq2Seq (Sequence-to-Sequence) language model processes or transforms sentences based on a syntactic hierarchical inductive bias or a linear inductive bias through transformation tasks. We replicate several previous experiments and explore our model’s capacity to exhibit human-like behavior. Our experiments provide evidence that, in transformation tasks, our pre-trained L2-textbook LSTM-based Seq2Seq model performed based on the linear rule rather than the hierarchical rule. In essence, our model showcased a linear inductive bias, consistent with the Scratch-Seq2Seq model."
Development and Testing of a Machine Learning Model Using 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT-Derived Metabolic Parameters to Classify Human Papillomavirus Status in Oropharyngeal Squamous Carcinoma,2023,"['Human papillomavirus', 'Machine learning', 'Oropharynx', 'Positron emission tomography', 'Squamous cell carcinoma']",,"Objective: To develop and test a machine learning model for classifying human papillomavirus (HPV) status of patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET-derived parameters in derived parameters and an appropriate combination of machine learning methods in patients with OPSCC.Materials and Methods: This retrospective study enrolled 126 patients (118 male; mean age, 60 years) with newly diagnosed, pathologically confirmed OPSCC, that underwent 18F-FDG PET-computed tomography (CT) between January 2012 and February 2020. Patients were randomly assigned to training and internal validation sets in a 7:3 ratio. An external test set of 19 patients (16 male; mean age, 65.3 years) was recruited sequentially from two other tertiary hospitals. Model 1 used only PET parameters, Model 2 used only clinical features, and Model 3 used both PET and clinical parameters. Multiple feature transforms, feature selection, oversampling, and training models are all investigated. The external test set was used to test the three models that performed best in the internal validation set. The values for area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were compared between models.Results: In the external test set, ExtraTrees-based Model 3, which uses two PET-derived parameters and three clinical features, with a combination of MinMaxScaler, mutual information selection, and adaptive synthetic sampling approach, showed the best performance (AUC = 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.46–1). Model 3 outperformed Model 1 using PET parameters alone (AUC = 0.48, p = 0.047) and Model 2 using clinical parameters alone (AUC = 0.52, p = 0.142) in predicting HPV status.Conclusion: Using oversampling and mutual information selection, an ExtraTree-based HPV status classifier was developed by combining metabolic parameters derived from 18F-FDG PET/CT and clinical parameters in OPSCC, which exhibited higher performance than the models using either PET or clinical parameters alone."
The Mediation Effect of Human Capital on the Relationship between Senior Entrepreneurial Competency and Entrepreneurial Performance Using Mediation Model,2023,"['Entrepreneurial competency', 'Human capital', 'Entrepreneurial performance', 'Partial mediation model', 'Completed mediation model']",,"Purpose: This study analyzed the mediation effect of human capital on the relationship between entrepreneurial competency and entrepreneurial performance using mediation model.Design/methodology/approach: This study was designed as a conceptual research model to verify the mediation effect of human capital on the relationship between entrepreneurial competency and entrepreneurial performance using mediation model. In order to design a conceptual research model, a total 24 items were investigated and the SEM method was verified using three latent variables.Findings: According to this study, human capital acted as a mediating effect in the relationship between entrepreneurial competency and entrepreneurial performance.

A temporal–spatiotemporal domain transformation-based modeling method for nonlinear distributed parameter systems,2023,"['spatiotemporal modeling', 'kernel-based extreme learning machine', 'distributed parameter system', 'strong nonlinearity', 'locally linear embedding']",,"Complex nonlinear distributed parameter systems (DPSs) exist widely in advanced industrial thermal processes. The modeling of such highly nonlinear systems is a challenge for traditional time/space-separation-based methods since they employ linear methods for the model reduction and spatiotemporal reconstruction, which may lead to an inefficient application of the nonlinear spatial structure features represented by the spatial basis functions. To overcome this problem, a novel spatiotemporal modeling framework composed of nonlinear temporal domain transformation and nonlinear spatiotemporal domain reconstruction is proposed in this paper. Firstly, local nonlinear dimension reduction based on the locally linear embedding technique is utilized to perform nonlinear temporal domain transformation of the spatiotemporal output of nonlinear DPSs. In this step, the original spatiotemporal data can be directly transformed into low-order time coefficients. Then, the extreme learning machine (ELM) method is utilized to establish a temporal model. Finally, through the spatiotemporal domain reconstruction based on the kernel-based ELM method, the prediction of the temporal dynamics obtained from the temporal model can be reconstructed back to the spatiotemporal output. The effectiveness and performance of the proposed method are demonstrated in experiments on the thermal processes of a snap curing oven and a lithium-ion battery."

To achieve this objective, particularly concerning the pre-training dataset, we inquire whether there are differences when using datasets of varying complexity. We use two distinct pre-training datasets: Child-Directed Speech and L2-Textbook dataset. Upon examination, we observe that these datasets exhibit different levels of syntactic complexity. Then, with our models, we employ two syntactic transformation tasks: (i) question formation and (ii) passivization. Our results indicate that model depth (number of layers) exerts a more significant influence on hierarchical generalization compared to other model components. Furthermore, we observed that models learn the hierarchical aspects of language more efficiently when exposed to the simpler complexity of the dataset."
RNN-Based Main Transformer OLTC Control for SMR Integration into a High Renewable Energy Penetrated Grid,2023,"['Voltage stability', 'Small modular reactor', 'Renewable energy', 'Recurrent neural networks', 'On-load tap-changer']",,"Voltage control is desirable for voltage stability of an electrical power system. Isolated high renewable energy grids have become a common phenomenon in the wake of the global shift to clean renewable energy sources (RES) fronted to achieve carbon neutrality. The most dominant RES are solar photovoltaic and wind energy which rely on switched power-electronic devices to cope with grid reactive power requirements. These devices often fall out of step with other synchronous generators due to the mismatch in synchronizing speed whenever a system disturbance occurs. Previous studies propose that voltage and frequency instability can be mitigated by the integration of a small modular reactor (SMR) in the RES grid. SMRs have load-following capability, reactive power compensation and supplementary voltage regulation capability; which is achieved using the main transformer’s on-load tap changer (OLTC). This paper proposes application of advanced machine learning-based recurrent neural networks (RNN) for the SMR main transformer OLTC control by leveraging on multiple parameters to predict the appropriate percentage tap values. The RNN model is built and tested using simulation data obtained from load flow analysis using the electrical transient and analysis program."

This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this stent in animal model.Materials and Methods: Ureteral stents were placed in five Yorkshire pigs. A bare stent was inserted on one side and an inner surface-modified stent was inserted on the other side. Two weeks after stenting, laparotomy was performed to harvest the ureteral stents. The changes in the inner surface were grossly evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).

It is considered one of the leading causes of infection-related deaths in children and seniors worldwide. Clinicians usually use chest X-ray images to diagnose pneumonia. However, pneumonia is prone to be misdiagnosed because it overlaps with cold and flu, causing severe and critical medical complications. Consequently, alternative supportive diagnostic methods are needed to minimize human errors and assist clinicians. Several attempts have used artificial intelligence systems, mainly in deep learning methods, to assist clinicians in early pneumonia diagnoses. However, further studies are required to consolidate the use of deep learning as an assistant tool to diagnose pneumonia accurately. In this study, we examine the Swin Transformer and the Residual Neural Network’s performance in classifying pneumonia and healthy chest X-ray images using the Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center dataset and the COVID19, Pneumonia and Normal Chest X-ray Posteroanterior dataset. The experiment results demonstrate that the Swin Transformer achieves an accuracy of 98.9% in the Chest X-ray images dataset and 92.35% in the COVID19, Pneumonia and Normal Chest X-ray Posteroanterior dataset, while the Residual Neural Network achieves an accuracy of 97.9% and 88.8% respectively in classifying pneumonia. These results indicate that the Swin Transformer outperforms the Residual Neural Network as a tool for assisting clinicians in diagnosing pneumonia. Thus, the Swin Transformer may help in early decision-making, leading to treatment initiation and improving patient's health."
"Power conversion system integrating OBC and LDC using tapped transformers for weight, volume, and cost reductions in electric vehicles",2023,"['Cost model analysis', 'Electric vehicles charger', 'Low voltage dc-to-dc converter', 'On-board charger']",,"Electric vehicle (EV) on-board chargers (OBC) use high-frequency transformers for isolation between the grid power and the propulsion battery. Additionally, low voltage dc-to-dc converters (LDC) require high-frequency transformers for high step-down and electrical isolation. Although a high-frequency transformer is used for isolation, it is desirable to minimize the use of magnetic materials because the isolation breakdown between the windings of the transformer occurs due to vibration. It also increases the weight and volume, and reduces the mileage of vehicles. Therefore, this paper proposes an OBC–LDCintegrated system without additional windings by dividing the transformer windings used for the OBC. Depending on the connection state of the selective switch in the proposed system, it is divided into a propulsion battery charging mode and an auxiliary battery charging mode. At the same time, the selective switch converts the required transformer turns ratio in the changed operation mode. The proposed OBC–LDC integrated system is verified through prototype experiments. In addition, the volume and weight of a conventional vehicle charger and the proposed integrated charger are compared, and the economic benefits of the proposed charger are derived through cost model analysis (CMA)."

Recently, spammersare creating more malicious spam by distorting the image of spam text so that optical character recognition(OCR)-based spam filters cannot easily detect it. Fortunately, the level of transformation of image spamcirculated on social media is not serious yet. However, in the mail system, spammers (the person who sendsspam) showed various modifications to the spam image for neutralizing OCR, and therefore, the same situationcan happen with spam images on social media. Spammers have been shown to interfere with OCR readingthrough geometric transformations such as image distortion, noise addition, and blurring. Various techniqueshave been studied to filter image spam, but at the same time, methods of interfering with image spamidentification using obfuscated images are also continuously developing. In this paper, we propose a deeplearning-based spam image detection model to improve the existing OCR-based spam image detectionperformance and compensate for vulnerabilities. The proposed model extracts text features and image featuresfrom the image using four sub-models. First, the OCR-based text model extracts the text-related features,whether the image contains spam words, and the word embedding vector from the input image. Then, theconvolution neural network-based image model extracts image obfuscation and image feature vectors from theinput image. The extracted feature is determined whether it is a spam image by the final spam image classifier.As a result of evaluating the F1-score of the proposed model, the performance was about 14 points higher thanthe OCR-based spam image detection performance."
Dynamic Tracking Aggregation with Transformers for RGB-T Tracking,2023,"['Cross-modal Fusion', 'Dynamic Tracking Aggregation', 'RGB-T Tracking', 'Transformers']",,"RGB-thermal (RGB-T) tracking using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) involves challenges with regards tothe similarity of objects, occlusion, fast motion, and motion blur, among other issues. In this study, we proposedynamic tracking aggregation (DTA) as a unified framework to perform object detection and data association.The proposed approach obtains fused features based a transformer model and an L1-norm strategy. To link thecurrent frame with recent information, a dynamically updated embedding called dynamic tracking identification(DTID) is used to model the iterative tracking process. For object association, we designed a long short-termtracking aggregation module for dynamic feature propagation to match spatial and temporal embeddings. DTAachieved a highly competitive performance in an experimental evaluation on public benchmark datasets."
Developing prompts from large language model for extracting clinical information from pathology and ultrasound reports in breast cancer,2023,"['Automatic data processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language processing', 'Breast cancer', 'Clinical reports']",,"Purpose: We aimed to evaluate the time and cost of developing prompts using large language model (LLM), tailored to extract clinical factors in breast cancer patients and their accuracy.Materials and Methods: We collected data from reports of surgical pathology and ultrasound from breast cancer patients who underwent radiotherapy from 2020 to 2022. We extracted the information using the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) for Sheets and Docs extension plugin and termed this the “LLM” method. The time and cost of developing the prompts with LLM methods were assessed and compared with those spent on collecting information with “full manual” and “LLM-assisted manual” methods. To assess accuracy, 340 patients were randomly selected, and the extracted information by LLM method were compared with those collected by “full manual” method.Results: Data from 2,931 patients were collected. We developed 12 prompts for Extract function and 12 for Format function to extract and standardize the information. The overall accuracy was 87.7%. For lymphovascular invasion, it was 98.2%. Developing and processing the prompts took 3.5 hours and 15 minutes, respectively. Utilizing the ChatGPT application programming interface cost US $65.8 and when factoring in the estimated wage, the total cost was US $95.4. In an estimated comparison, “LLM-assisted manual” and “LLM” methods were time- and cost-efficient compared to the “full manual” method.Conclusion: Developing and facilitating prompts for LLM to derive clinical factors was efficient to extract crucial information from huge medical records. This study demonstrated the potential of the application of natural language processing using LLM model in breast cancer patients. Prompts from the current study can be re-used for other research to collect clinical information."
Accuracy analysis for machine tool spindles considering full parallel connections and form errors based on skin model shapes,2023,"['spindle', 'full parallel connection', 'rotation accuracy', 'skin model shape', 'iterative closest point']",,"The rotation accuracy of a machine tool spindle is essential for ensuring the machining precision. Due to the existence of manufacturing and assembly errors, the rotation accuracy of the spindle will be inevitably impacted and degraded. Therefore, to reduce the influence of the errors and improve the work performance, this paper focuses on accuracy analysis for the spindle and a novel optimization-oriented skin model shape method to tackle this highly complex problem. First, a structural analysis of the spindle is carried out to elaborate the intractable full parallel collections in the assembly. Then, based on the iterative closest point method, the deviation propagation of the spindle considering complex full parallel collections is transformed into an optimization problem, in which the skin model shapes and small displacement torsor are utilized to represent the form and pose errors of the part, respectively. By solving the optimization problem, assembly accuracy analysis for the spindle in terms of full parallel connections and form errors is accordingly achieved. On this basis, the tolerance analysis model of the spindle is also comprehensively established by employing the corresponding error simulation. Finally, measurement experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experiments show the predicted rotation runout and tolerance magnitude are close to the testing results, therefore indicating the proposed method can provide effective accuracy analysis for spindles."
Generating Radiology Reports via Multi-feature Optimization Transformer,2023,"['Attention mechanism', 'Feature fusion', 'Radiology report', 'Transformer', 'Image-text generation']",,"As an important research direction of the application of computer science in the medical field, the automatic generation technology of radiology report has attracted wide attention in the academic community. Because the proportion of normal regions in radiology images is much larger than that of abnormal regions, words describing diseases are often masked by other words, resulting in significant feature loss during the calculation process, which affects the quality of generated reports. In addition, the huge difference between visual features and semantic features causes traditional multi-modal fusion method to fail to generate long narrative structures consisting of multiple sentences, which are required for medical reports. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-feature optimization Transformer (MFOT) for generating radiology reports. In detail, a multi-dimensional mapping attention (MDMA) module is designed to encode the visual grid features from different dimensions to reduce the loss of primary features in the encoding process; a feature pre-fusion (FP) module is constructed to enhance the interaction ability between multi-modal features, so as to generate a reasonably structured radiology report; a detail enhanced attention (DEA) module is proposed to enhance the extraction and utilization of key features and reduce the loss of key features. In conclusion, we evaluate the performance of our proposed model against prevailing mainstream models by utilizing widely-recognized radiology report datasets, namely IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that our model achieves SOTA performance on both datasets, compared with the base model, the average improvement of six key indicators is 19.9% and 18.0% respectively. These findings substantiate the efficacy of our model in the domain of automated radiology report generation."
Parametric study on absorption process for high-power laser irradiation of aluminum with robust collision frequency model,2023,['Laser-target interaction · High-energy–density plasma · Collision frequency model · Laser energy absorption · Radiation hydrodynamics simulation'],,"Due to the improvement and sophistication of laser technologies in the last several decades, high-energy–density plasma (HEDP), which were only attainable in extreme environments such as stellar interiors and nuclear explosions, can now be generated in laboratory scale via laser–target interactions. This breakthrough in technology has made HEDP research more accessible, and thus active studies on HEDP have been ongoing. In this work, laser energy absorption is investigated in the context of laser–target interactions. Because energy absorption in laser–target interactions is mediated by collisional processes like inverse bremsstrahlung, an accurate modeling of the collision frequency between electron and ion is crucial. However, depending on the laser confgurations, the target undergoes transformation from solid to warm dense matter (WDM), and then to hot dense plasma, and the collisional behaviors are considerably diferent for each material state. In order to address this issue, a new, versatile, and robust collision frequency model was proposed by interpolating the models for solid state and for hot dense plasma. An extensive numerical calculation was conducted using a 1D radiation hydrodynamics code (MULTI), and a wide range of values for each laser parameter (laser intensity, pulse duration, and wavelength) is examined.The dependencies of the laser energy absorption, as well as the temporal dynamics of laser energy absorption process, on each laser parameter are presented."
BRepGAT: Graph neural network to segment machining feature faces in a B-rep model,2023,"['graph neural networks', 'deep learning', 'boundary representation', 'machining feature', 'face segmentation']",,"In recent years, there have been many studies using artificial intelligence to recognize machining features in three-dimensional models in the computer-aided design (CAD)/computer-aided manufacturing field. Most of these studies converted the original CAD data into images, point clouds, or voxels for recognition. This led to information loss during the conversion process, resulting in decreased recognition accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning model called the boundary representation graph attention network (BRepGAT) to segment faces in an original boundary representation (B-rep) model containing machining features. We define descriptors that represent information about the faces and edges of the B-rep model from the perspective of feature recognition. These descriptors are extracted from the B-rep model and transformed into homogeneous graph data, which are then passed to graph networks. BRepGAT recognizes machining features from the graph data input. Our experimental results using the MFCAD18++ dataset showed that BRepGAT achieved state-of-the-art recognition accuracy (99.1%). Furthermore, BRepGAT showed relatively robust performance on other datasets besides MFCAD18++."
Application of Recurrence Plots and VGG Deep Learning Model to the Study of Condition Monitoring of Robotic Grinding,2023,"['VGG16', 'Recurrence plots', 'Grinding']",,"This study adopted AI to identify the normal and abnormal vibration signals generated during robotic grinding. This study classified four fundamental factors affecting grinding into three levels to obtain a widely used result and designed an L9(34)orthogonal array for the grinding experiment. During experimentation, part of the grinding wheels was added weight to produce abnormal vibration signals, which an accelerometer would measure. The study transformed the collected vibration signals into recurrence plots and conducted model training with VGG16 CNN architecture. Finally, this study tested a model with 89.6% training accuracy. The results showed the model could identify whether the recurrence plots stand for normal or abnormal vibrations, with an accuracy of 85%. This means it could predict normal and abnormal grinding conditions and help avoid problems caused by abnormal vibrations."
Memory-based Human Postural Regulation Control: An Asynchronous Semi-Markov Model Approach,2023,"['Asynchronous regulation', 'convex optimization', 'human postural regulation', 'memory-based regulation', 'semi-Markov jump system.']",,"This article investigates the human postural regulation problem from the dynamical system perspective, which is also applicable for human-like robotics. More precisely, since the dynamical human posture parameters may change caused by varying load or environment abrupt, the semi-Markov jump process is employed to model the human standing postural dynamics with multiple modes. Furthermore, a novel memorized regulation strategy is developed for guaranteeing the stable standing such that the past memory information can be well utilized. In particular, the asynchronous regulation procedure is considered for better describing the human postural model with mismatched jumping modes. By model transformation and stochastic analysis, mode-dependent regulation criteria with state feedback model are established by convex optimization approach, based on which the mode-dependent regulation gains are designed accordingly. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed regulation strategy is verified via an illustrative example of quiet upright standing posture."
A structural response reconstruction method based on a continuous-discrete state space model,2023,['· Continuous-discrete time systems · Cubature kalman filter · Structural response reconstruction · Tikhonov regularization'],,"Structural response reconstruction is an important technique for structural health monitoring. However, aiming at the problem of discretization error in the discrete state space model used in structural response reconstruction, a novel structural response reconstruction method based on a continuous-discrete state space model is proposed, which can avoid the discretization error and improve the reconstruction performance. Firstly, the structure is modelled with a continuous-discrete state space model and the process noise covariance matrix is transformed into the process noise gain matrix. Secondly, square root cubature Kalman filter is applied for response reconstruction and the Gaussian nested implicit Runge-Kutta method is used for state recursion. Then the ill-conditioned matrix inverse problem is solved in the posterior estimation with the Tikhonov regularization method. Finally, the proposed method is validated through numerical simulation of a two-dimension truss and response test of an overhanging beam. The results show that the proposed method can achieve high reconstruction accuracy even when the noise level is 30 %, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in practical engineering applications."
Peripheral Neuropathy and Decreased Locomotion of a RAB40B Mutation in Human and Model Animals,2023,"['Peripheral neuropathy', 'RAB40B', 'SOCS box', 'Zebrafish', 'Drosophila']",,"Rab40 proteins are an atypical subgroup of Rab GTPases containing a unique suppressor of the cytokine signaling (SOCS) domain that is recruitedto assemble the CRL5 E3 ligase complex for proteolytic regulation in various biological processes. A nonsense mutation deleting the C-terminalSOCS box in the RAB40B gene was identified in a family with axonal peripheral neuropathy (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2), and pathogenicityof the mutation was assessed in model organisms of zebrafish and Drosophila . Compared to control fish, zebrafish larvae transformed by thehuman mutant hRAB40B-Y83X showed a defective swimming pattern of stalling with restricted localization and slower motility. We were consistentlyable to observe reduced labeling of synaptic markers along neuromuscular junctions of the transformed larvae. In addition to the neurodevelopmentalphenotypes, compared to normal hRAB40B expression, we further examined ectopic expression of hRAB40B-Y83X in Drosophila toshow a progressive decline of locomotion ability. Decreased ability of locomotion by ubiquitous expression of the human mutation was reproducednot with GAL4 drivers for neuron-specific expression but only when a pan-glial GAL4 driver was applied. Using the ectopic expression model ofDrosophila , we identified a genetic interaction in which Cul5 down regulation exacerbated the defective motor performance, showing a consistentloss of SOCS box of the pathogenic RAB40B. Taken together, we could assess the possible gain-of-function of the human RAB40B mutation bycomparing behavioral phenotypes in animal models; our results suggest that the mutant phenotypes may be associated with CRL5-mediated proteolyticregulation."

Transforming clinical trials: the emerging roles of large language models,2023,"['Clinical Trial', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Informed Consent', 'Medical Writing']",,"Clinical trials are essential for medical research, but they often face challenges in matching patients to trials and planning. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution, signaling a transformative shift in the field of clinical trials. This review explores the multifaceted applications of LLMs within clinical trials, focusing on five main areas expected to be implemented in the near future: enhancing patient-trial matching, streamlining clinical trial planning, analyzing free text narratives for coding and classification, assisting in technical writing tasks, and providing cognizant consent via LLM-powered chatbots. While the application of LLMs is promising, it poses challenges such as accuracy validation and legal concerns. The convergence of LLMs with clinical trials has the potential to revolutionize the efficiency of clinical trials, paving the way for innovative methodologies and enhancing patient engagement. However, this development requires careful consideration and investment to overcome potential hurdles."
Plate-curving cell culture as a model for assessing curvature-induced cellular responses during neural tube morphogenesis,2023,"['Curvature', 'morphogenesis', 'neuroepithelium', 'neural plate', 'transcriptome analysis']",,"Neurulation is an important shape-transforming event during embryonic development where a flatneural plate is converted into a neural tube. Failure in this morphogenetic process accounts for oneof the most common birth defects. Mechanical biology has provided key insights into neural tubeformation and curvature among many physical properties that are eliciting attention. However, thelack of a proper model to study the effect of curvature has limited the potential to reveal its role inneurulation. In this study, we introduce a novel cell culture method called plate-curving cell culturewhere a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) plate of desired physical properties is curved in either aconcave or convex form while the human pluripotent stem cell culture induced to have earlyneural plate identity is placed on top of its surface. With this method, we observed theelongation of cell colony morphology, as well as the perpendicular alignment of the celldivision axis in the concave surface; the oriented cell division does not seem to explain thecolony elongation. Transcriptome comparison in search of alternate possibilities suggestedselectively altered pathways in the concave surface culture. Our new method is widely available,easy-to-use and culture-friendly, facilitating future mechanobiological studies of neurulation."
Global Citizenship Education(GCED) and Engineering for Non-Majors Convergence D-SteamRobot(DSR) educational model,2023,"['Robot Education', 'Ecological Transformation Education', 'SDGs', 'Problem Solving', 'Divergent Thinking']",,"This study aims to enhance the engineering education for non-majors by incorporating the concept of Global Citizenship Education and addressing the need for education that responds to climate and ecological changes. The study uses robot programming as a tool to foster the development of global citizens. Non-majors often struggle with producing more than just motionless forms or solid productions, due to a lack of understanding of mechanisms and coding. The study proposes the use of the Convergence D-SteamRobot (DSR) to address this issue by blending humanities and engineering. This is achieved by presenting problems through books to increase empathy, integrating simple machine mechanisms, and creating prototypes to solve self-defined problems. Through this process, learners determine the SDGs topic they want to solve and learn about the simple mechanical mechanism involved in producing the prototype. The educational model provides a constructivist learning environment that emphasizes empathy and exploration, encourages peer-learning, and improves divergent thinking and problem-solving skills."

Tungsten-based activated carbon matrix for the catalytic oxidation of model volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and pharmaceutical VOCs from wastewater,2023,['Volatile organic compounds Tungsten Activated carbon matrix Catalytic oxidation Hydroxyl radical'],,"Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a paramount factor in air pollution of the environment. VOCs are vastly present in the wastewater discharged by the pharmaceutical industries. As it is evaporative in nature, it enters the environment spontaneously and causes air pollution, global warming, acid rain and climate change. VOCs must be treated before discharging or any other aerobic methods using an efficient catalyst. As the catalytic oxidation in the liquid phase is facile compared to the gas phase, this study investigated on catalytic liquid-phase oxidation of VOCs in model and real pharmaceutical wastewater. The model compounds of toluene-, ethylbenzene- and chlorobenzene-contaminated waters were treated separately along with the VOCs present in real pharmaceutical wastewater using a tungsten-based carbon catalyst. The tungsten was impregnated on the low-cost activated carbon matrix as it has good selectivity and catalytic property toward VOCs for facile catalytic operations. The metal catalysts were characterised by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction studies, and scanning electron microscopy with elemental and mapping analysis. The treatability was monitored by total organic carbon, ultra-violet spectroscopy and high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis. The tungsten-impregnated activated carbon matrix (WACM) has a catalytic efficiency toward toluene by 85.45 ± 1.78%, ethylbenzene by 93.9 ± 1.16%, chlorobenzene by 85.9 ± 2.26% and pharmaceutical VOCs by 85.05 ± 1.73% in 20 treatment cycles. The results showed that WACM worked efficiently in VOCs treatment, preventing the environment from air pollution. Furthermore, liquid-phase oxidation could easily be implementable on an industrial scale."
The effects of berberine on ischemia-reperfusion injuries in an experimental model of ovarian torsion,2023,"['Berberine', 'Ischemia reperfusion injury', 'Ovarian follicle', 'Ovarian torsion', 'Transforming growth factor beta']",,"Objective: Ovarian torsion is a gynecological disorder that causes ischemia-reperfusion injuries in the ovary. Our study investigated berberine's short- and long-term effects on ovarian ischemia-reperfusion injuries. Methods: This study included 28 Wistar albino female rats weighing 180 to 220 g, which were divided into four groups: sham (S), torsion/detorsion (T/D), torsion/ detorsion+single dose berberine (T/D+Bb), and torsion/detorsion+15 days berberine (T/D+15Bb). The torsion and detorsion model was applied in all non-sham groups. In the T/D+Bb group, a single dose of berberine was administered, while in the T/D+15Bb group, berberine was administered over a period of 15 days. After the rats were euthanized, their ovaries were excised. The left ovaries were used for histopathologic evaluation, which included ovarian injury scoring and follicle count, while the right ovaries were used for biochemical analyses (tissue transforming growth factor-β [TGF-β] and alpha-smooth muscle actin [α-SMA] levels). Results: The histopathologic evaluation scores for the ovaries were significantly lower in the T/D+B group (p<0.05) and the T/D+15B group (p<0.005) than in the T/D group. The follicle counts in the T/D group were lower than those in both the sham and treated groups (p<0.005). The TGF-β levels were significantly lower in the T/D+15B group (p<0.005), whereas the α-SMA levels did not show a significant difference. Conclusion: Both short- and long-term berberine use could potentially have therapeutic effects on ovarian torsion. Long-term berberine use exhibited anti-inflammatory effects by reducing TGF-β levels, thereby preventing ischemia-reperfusion injuries. Therefore, we suggest that long-term berberine use could be beneficial for ovarian torsion."
The pricing of vulnerable foreign exchange options under a multiscale stochastic volatility model,2023,"['Vulnerable option', 'foreign exchange option', 'multiscale stochastic volatility', 'asymptotic analysis', 'Monte-Carlo method.']",,"Foreign exchange options are derivative financial instruments that can exchange one currency for another at a prescribed exchange rate on a specified date. In this study, we examine the analytic formulas for vulnerable foreign exchange options based on multi-scale stochastic volatility driven by two diffusion processes: a fast mean-reverting process and a slow mean-reverting process. In particular, we take advantage of the asymptotic analysis and the technique of the Mellin transform on the partial differential equation (PDE) with respect to the option price, to derive approximated prices that are combined with a leading order price and two correction term prices. To verify the price accuracy of the approximated solutions, we utilize the Monte Carlo method. Furthermore, in the numerical experiments, we investigate the behaviors of the vulnerable foreign exchange options prices in terms of model parameters and the sensitivities of the stochastic volatility factors to the option price."
"Omega-3 fatty acids upregulate Nrf2 expression and attenuate apoptosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in a rat model of cyclosporine-induced nephropathy",2023,"['Apoptosis', 'Fibrosis', 'Inflammation', 'Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2', 'Omega-3 fatty acid']",,"Background: Cyclosporine A (CsA)-induced kidney injury is characterized by renal impairment with inflammatory cell infiltrations, apoptosis, fibrosis, and hypoxic injury. It is not clear whether omega-3 fatty acids (O-3 FAs), which have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant roles, affect nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression. The aim of this study was to investigate whether O-3 FAs affect Nrf2 expression and exert anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anti-fibrotic effects in CsA-induced nephropathy.Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into control, CsA-treated, and CsA-treated with O-3 FA groups. Nrf2 expression was measured by Western blots and immunohistochemical staining.Results: Kidney function was impaired in the CsA-treated rats compared to the controls. Caspase-3 and caspase-7 were activated in the CsA-treated group, and the Bax/Bcl2 ratio was higher. O-3 FAs attenuated these apoptosis-related changes. ED-1 and inhibition of kappa B (IĸB) protein expression were significantly upregulated in the CsA-treated group. Compared to the control group, O-3 FA supplementation attenuated the increased expression of ED-1 and IĸB related to inflammation. Smad2/3, Smad4, and transforming growth factor-β1 were activated in the CsA group, and O-3 FA treatment prevented these changes related to renal fibrosis. The expression of Nrf2 was reduced in CsA-treated rats, but Nrf-2 was increased by O-3 FA treatment.Conclusions: We suggest that Nrf2 is a potential mediator induced by O-3 FA supplementation and that it attenuates pro-inflammatory pathways, fibrotic processes, and apoptosis. Further studies are needed to elucidate the crosstalk between Nrf2 expression and signals related to O-3 FA treatment."

Color Vision Deficiency (CVD) is a condition resulting from the malfunction of retinal cone cells, leading to an inability to discern certain or all colors, for which no precise medical treatment exists. Utilizing an AI model for color transformation in individuals with CVD offers the advantage of easily adjusting the degree of color correction based on personal preferences, thanks to models trained on extensive datasets. However, the scarcity of suitable training data hinders the active pursuit of color transformation research using AI models in the context of CVD. Therefore, we propose two approaches to design and implement AI models for color transformation in individuals with CVD using limited data. The first approach involves utilizing CycleGAN’s unpaired image training to partition the dataset and train the model, addressing the lack of paired data in the CVD domain due to labeling complexities. The second approach explicitly defines and trains fine-grained color adjustment modules and transforms colors accordingly. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, experiments were conducted using two datasets (Ishihara and Flowers-17), demonstrating the successful achievement of effective color transformation for individuals with CVD across all datasets."

An important technique in these simulations is to deform the object by an external force. Here, we will discuss how to process the deformation of a part of a solid object in real time. In this paper, we propose a geometric model transformation technique using two-step voxelization and adaptive remeshing. First, the target mesh is voxelized at high resolution and the generated volume data is compressed. If a part of the model is cut or polished by an external force, the corresponding voxel is modified by reflecting it in the converted volume data instead of directly applying it to the mesh. Then, the mesh is extracted again through the marching cube algorithm and the surface is smoothed through Laplacian smoothing. Existing marching cube algorithms and Laplacian smoothing algorithms have slow processing speeds, so real-time transformation processing is difficult. To solve this problem, real-time mesh creation was made possible by applying remeshing only to the deformed part instead of remeshing the entire mesh. In order to confirm the effectiveness of this method, it was confirmed that it is possible to shave part of the teeth by applying this method to dental surgery simulation."

Although vision transformer deep learning models have outperformed conventional convolutional neural network (CNN) models in computer vision, they require more computations and parameters than CNN models. Thus, they are not directly applicable to embedded edge devices with limited hardware resources. Many researchers have proposed various model compression methods or lightweight architectures for vision transformers; however, there are only a few studies evaluating the effects of model compression techniques of vision transformers on performance. Regarding this problem, this paper presents a performance evaluation of vision transformers on embedded platforms. We investigated the behaviors of three vision transformers: DeiT, LeViT, and MobileViT. Each model performance was evaluated by accuracy and inference time on edge devices using the ImageNet dataset. We assessed the effects of the quantization method applied to the models on latency enhancement and accuracy degradation by profiling the proportion of response time occupied by major operations. In addition, we evaluated the performance of each model on GPU and EdgeTPU-based edge devices. In our experimental results, LeViT showed the best performance in CPU-based edge devices, and DeiT-small showed the highest performance improvement in GPU-based edge devices. In addition, only MobileViT models showed performance improvement on EdgeTPU. Summarizing the analysis results through profiling,  the degree of performance improvement of each vision transformer model was highly dependent on the proportion of parts that could be optimized in the target edge device. In summary, to apply vision transformers to on-device AI solutions, either proper operation composition and optimizations specific to target edge devices must be considered."

This study focuses on creating a model that utilizes multiple sources of information about users and items by employing a multimodality approach. The study addresses the task of how to gather information from different sources (modalities) and transform them into a uniform format, resulting in a multi-modal feature description for users and items. This work also aims to transform and represent the features extracted from different modalities so that the information is in a compatible format for integration and contains important, useful information for the prediction model. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel multi-modal recommendation model, which involves extracting latent features of users and items from a utility matrix using matrix factorization techniques. Various transformation techniques are utilized to extract features from other sources of information such as user reviews, item descriptions, and item categories. We also proposed the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Feature Selection techniques to reduce the data dimension and extract important features as well as remove noisy features to increase the accuracy of the model. We conducted several different experimental models based on different subsets of modalities on the MovieLens and Amazon sub-category datasets. According to the experimental results, the proposed model significantly enhances the accuracy of recommendations when compared to SVD, which is acknowledged as one of the most effective models for recommender systems. Specifically, the proposed model reduces the RMSE by a range of 4.8% to 21.43% and increases the Precision by a range of 2.07% to 26.49% for the Amazon datasets. Similarly, for the MovieLens dataset, the proposed model reduces the RMSE by 45.61% and increases the Precision by 14.06%.

To address the limitation, this paper proposes MPC(Multiple Periodicity Consideration)-TimesNet model designed to handle intricate locality information within periodicity by considering not only low frequencies information, but also that of high frequencies. The proposed model added HFEM(High Frequency Extraction Module) to the previous TimesNet model in order to exquisitely account for high frequencies data. In addition, we lowered the size of representations as the self-information gets smaller to address noise issues.

However, since convolutional neural networks receive only images of the same size, preprocessing such as sampling may be required, and in the case of oversampling, information loss of the original image such as image quality degradation and blurring occurs. In this paper, in order to minimize the above problem, to generate a image patch based graph of an original image and propose a random walk-based positional encoding method to apply the graph transformer model. The above method continuously learns the position embedding information of patches which don`t have a positional information based on the random walk algorithm, and finds the optimal graph structure by aggregating useful node information through the self-attention technique of graph transformer model. Therefore, it is robust and shows good performance even in a new graph structure of random node order and an arbitrary graph structure according to the location of an object in an image.

A typical encoder-decoder model, such as an autoencoder, transforms the encoder input into a latent vector and feeds it into the decoder. In this process, the encoder-decoder model learns to produce an decoder output similar to the encoder input. We can consider that the latent vector of the encoder-decoder model is well preserved by abstracting the characteristics of the encoder input. Further, it is possible to apply to unsupervised learning, if the latent vector guarantees a sufficient distance between clusters in the feature space. In this paper, the classification performance of latent vectors is analyzed as a basic study for applying latent vectors in encoder-decoder models to unsupervised and continual learning. The latent vectors obtained by the stacked autoencoder and 2 types of CNN-based autoencoder are applied to 4 kinds of classifiers including KNN and random forest. Experimental results show that the latent vector using the CNN-based autoencoder with a dense layer (about 97%) shows superior classification performance by up to 2% compared to the result of the stacked autoencoder (about 95%). Based on the results in this paper, it is possible to extend the latent vector obtained by using a CNN-based auto-encoder with dense layer to unsupervised learning."

Whisper was pretrained on a large corpus (around 680,000 hours) of web speech data and has demonstrated strong recognition performance for major languages.However, it faces challenges in recognizing languages such as Korean, which is not major language while training.We address this issue by fine-tuning the Whisper model with an additional dataset comprising about 1,000 hours of Korean speech. We also compare its performance against a Transformer model that was trained from scratch using the same dataset. Our results indicate that fine-tuning the Whisper model significantly improved its Korean speech recognition capabilities in terms of character error rate (CER). Specifically, the performance improved with increasing model size.However, the Whisper model’s performance on English deteriorated post fine-tuning, emphasizing the need for further research to develop robust multilingual models.

Given its inherently ill-posed nature, recent studies have focused on data-driven learning-based methods, particularly deep learning techniques based on convolutional neural networks. Building on the success of vision transformers (ViTs), ViT-based models have gained widespread attention for MDE applications. To enhance the performance of MDE, we introduce an intermediate bi-directional long-short term memory (BiLSTM) module, a common component in natural language processing, to learn correlations between each token in a sequence both in the forward and backward directions. Given that transformers naturally encode sequential data, leveraging BiLSTMs to learn the correlations between each token in both directions is a reasonable approach. In addition, we enhance the weight initialization method for BiLSTMs by employing the CLS tokens of transformers, which was originally developed for natural language processing, to make it applicable for processing two-dimensional image data. Subsequently, we developed an MDE model by inserting a BiLSTM module initialized using our method between the encoder and decoder of a DPT-based architecture. Our experiments reveal notable results, with our model achieving 0.913 in δ_1 and 0.097 in AbsRel for the NYU Depth V2 dataset. These results demonstrate a significant improvement over the previous models."

Lung cancer often has no early symptoms, so patients often miss the time of treatment. Accordingly, in Korea, lung cancer has been included in the national cancer screening since 2019. However, among misdiagnosis cases, lung cancer had the highest misdiagnosis rate, and the accuracy of screening may vary depending on the medical specialist's skill level and fatigue. Accordingly, this paper proposed a lung cancer CADx(Computer-Aided Diagnosis) system based on EfficientNetV2-L and ConvNeXt-B. EfficientNetV2 is a model that can have high classification performance with a small number of parameters using the Training-Aware NAS (Neural Architecture Search) method. ConvNeXt is a network that achieves higher performance than ViT(Vision Transformer) by combining the latest techniques with ResNet-50 as a base model. Medical imaging generally suffers from a data shortage problem. Therefore, we augmented the lung cancer dataset using AutoAugment using the ImageNet augmentation policy. Through this method, the sensitivity in classifying malignant(lung cancer) and normal improved from 0.8354 to 0.9638 in EfficientNetV2 and from 0.9796 to 0.9963 in ConvNeXt.AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) also improved from 0.9967 to 0.9974 for EfficientNetV2 and from 0.9973 to 1.0000 for ConvNeXt.

In this study, we introduce the Transformer embedded Graph Convolutional Network (TeGCN), which aims to address these limitations and enable effective default prediction for thin filers. TeGCN combines the TabTransformer, capable of extracting contextual information from categorical variables, with the Graph Convolutional Network, which captures network information between borrowers. Our TeGCN model surpasses the baseline model’s performance across both the general borrower dataset and the thin filer dataset. Specially, our model performs outstanding results in thin filer default prediction. This study achieves high default prediction accuracy by a model structure tailored to characteristics of credit information containing numerous categorical variables, especially in the context of thin filers with limited data. Our study can contribute to resolving the financial exclusion issues faced by thin filers and facilitate additional revenue within the financial industry."

In this paper, we present a transformer-based architecture for predicting the health status of agents, with the help of multi-head attention mechanism to effectively capture the dynamic interaction between friendly and enemy forces. To this end, we first introduce a framework for generating a dataset of battlefield situations. These situations are simulated on a virtual simulator, allowing for a wide range of scenarios without any restrictions on the number of agents, their missions, or their actions. Then, we define the crucial elements for identifying the battlefield, with a specific emphasis on agents’ status. The battlefield data is fed into the transformer architecture, with classification headers on top of the transformer encoding layers to categorize health status of agent. We conduct ablation tests to assess the significance of various factors in determining agents’ health status in battlefield scenarios. We conduct 3-Fold corss validation and the experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves a prediction accuracy of over 98%. In addition, the performance of our model are compared with that of other models such as convolutional neural network (CNN) and multi layer perceptron (MLP), and the results establish the superiority of our model."

To improve the efficiency of the drug discovery, artificial intelligence has been actively applied in the field. Aptamers, one of next-generation biomaterials in the drug discovery, attracts a lot of attention in recent decades. Aptamers are single-strand oligonucleotides that comprise tertiary structures and bind to specific target proteins. Aptamers are considered safer and more stable than traditional biomaterials. Therefore, Aptamers are used in various new drug development fields, such as laboratory tests for infectious diseases and cancer treatments. However, SELEX, a representative experiment for aptamer discovery, face at challenges since it takes a lot of time to determine aptamer sequences that bind to a given target protein. In this study, we developed a computer-based method to reduce the cost for aptamer discovery. And we also developed a transformer-based aptamer-protein interaction prediction classification model for discovering aptamer candidate sequences, and propose a system for generating aptamer candidate sequences using genetic algorithms. Nucleotide sequences could be generated using the designed system, and a molecular structure docking simulation called ZDOCK was used to measure the quality of the generated candidate sequences. As a result, generated sequences were confirmed that the docking score was similar or higher than that of the actual aptamers."

However, most existing analyzers present morpheme analysis results by learning word unit tokens as input values. However, since Korean words are consist of postpositions and affixes that are attached to the root, even if they have the same root, the meaning tends to change due to the postpositions or affixes. Therefore, learning morphemes using word unit tokens can lead to misclassification of postposition or affixes. In this paper, we use morpheme-level tokens to grasp the inherent meaning in Korean sentences and propose a morpheme analyzer based on a sequence generation method using Transformer. In addition, a user dictionary is constructed based on corpus data to solve the out-of-vocabulary problem.

This heightened emphasis is particularly pronounced due to the need to adapt vocational training to accommodate the exigencies of swiftly evolving technological landscapes and to avert the marginalization of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which constitute a substantial share of employment in various economies. Consequently, policy endeavors have prioritized the provision of systematic training interventions aligned with corporate requisites. In the context of this research, a vocational training model attuned to the distinct attributes of SMEs has been formulated in response to these societal dynamics. The pedagogical framework of this model has been structured to encompass a Problem-Based Learning (PBL) methodology, delineated into three discrete phases: 1) a theoretical-oriented pedagogy, 2) an applied industry-centric curriculum, and 3) advisory consultancy geared towards enhancing corporate operational efficacy. Moreover, the training paradigm takes cognizance of the industrial sector and occupational facets germane to SMEs, delineating training domains into 1) cutting-edge manufacturing and 2) mechanical component fabrication and processing. Concomitantly, the training continuum is stratified into rudimentary, intermediate, and advanced tiers, stratifying participants differentially based on their training specialization and progression level. Furthermore, to engender a training curriculum that aptly reconciles industry-specific nuances with overarching knowledge domains, distinct training modules have been crafted for the sphere of advanced manufacturing and the realm of mechanical component fabrication and processing. Additionally, a strategic framework has been derived to orchestrate synergistic alignments between internal and external resources, engendering optimal operational coherence within the purview of the training model."

Among various methods for this, multi-view 3D human pose estimation is essential for precise estimation even in complex real-world environments. But Existing models for multi-view 3D human posture estimation have the disadvantage of high order of time complexity as they use 3D feature maps. This paper proposes a method to extend an existing monocular viewpoint multi-frame model based on Transformer with lower time complexity to 3D human posture estimation for multi-viewpoints. To expand to multi-viewpoints our proposed method first generates an 8-dimensional joint coordinate that connects 2-dimensional joint coordinates for 17 joints at 4-vieiwpoints acquired using the 2-dimensional human posture detector, CPN(Cascaded Pyramid Network). This paper then converts them into 17×32 data with patch embedding, and enters the data into a transformer model, finally. Consequently, the MLP(Multi-Layer Perceptron) block that outputs the 3D-human posture simultaneously updates the 3D human posture estimation for 4-viewpoints at every iteration. Compared to Zheng[5]'s method the number of model parameters of the proposed method was 48.9%, MPJPE(Mean Per Joint Position Error) was reduced by 20.6 mm (43.8%) and the average learning time per epoch was more than 20 times faster."

Therefore, this study proposes a fusion architecture that can train transformers even with limited medical datasets. The fusion architecture combines a transformer encoder and a convolutional neural network decoder, which allows the transformer encoder to converge stably and learn both global and local features in the image. In addition, a loss function that combines three loss functions is used for fast and stable image segmentation learning. In this study, the superiority and stability of the proposed architecture are validated using two colonoscopic polyp datasets.

Existing research on crowdfunding has mainly used quantitative data such as video views, image counts, and duration as variables. Some studies have incorporated unstructured text variables, utilizing metrics like the number of parts of speech, sentence length, or topics extracted through topic analysis. However, these variables often lack the contextual meaning of the text or provide limited reflection.In this study, language models are employed to extend the use of text and incorporate contextual meaning. Two models, DNN prediction models and classification models, were employed for the research. For text variables, pretrained BERT models released in 2017 and Transformer Encoder models trained directly on text data were utilized. Unlike previous research, the dependent variable was set as the number of funding supporters, and DNN was constructed using both text and numeric data. Furthermore, data featuring the increase in supporters on a daily basis was also utilized.This study collected data from Wadiz, a crowdfunding site, spanning from January 2021 to January 2023, encompassing a total of 9,755 completed funding projects. The collected data includes project categories, funding names, descriptions, main text, funding duration, funding amount, number of supporters, achievement rate, option prices, option quantities, counts of main images and videos, counts of images and videos in the main text, scroll length, and daily funding amount. By employing text in DNN models, using data analyzed by BERT and Transformer Encoder alongside numeric data, a different structural form from traditional regression models was achieved, resulting in improved outcomes.

Therefore, ground roll suppression is a crucial step in seismic data processing. Several techniques, such as f-k filtering and curvelet transform, have been developed to suppress the ground roll. However, the existing methods still require improvements in suppression performance and efficiency. Various studies on the suppression of ground roll in seismic data have recently been conducted using deep learning methods developed for image processing.

Common shot gathers from the same field were divided into training and test datasets to compare the algorithms. We trained the models using the training data and evaluated their performances using the test data. When training these models with field data, ground roll removed data are required; therefore, the ground roll is suppressed by f-k filtering and used as the ground-truth data. To evaluate the performance of the deep learning models and compare the training results, we utilized quantitative indicators such as the correlation coefficient and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) based on the similarity to the ground-truth data.

OpenAI의 Codex 모델을 사용하여 Github가 보유한 소스 코드를 학습시켜 개발자가 통합 개발 환경(Integrated Development Environment, IDE)에서 GitHub Copilot Extension을 설치하고 주석이나 함수명을 입력하면 인공지능이 작성해야 할 소스 코드를 자동 완성하여 제시해 주어 개발자의 생산성을 높여주고 있다. 다만 인공지능이 학습하지 않은 코드에 대해서는 완벽한 코드를 제시하지 못하며 간혹 AI가 개발자의 의도를 잘못 이해하고 많은 부분을 수정해야 하는 코드를 제시하기도 한다. 그렇게 되면 오히려 생산성에 마이너스가 될 수도 있다. 본 논문에서는 Github의 Copilot이 Github repository를 이용하여 코드를 학습시켰듯이 전자정부표준프레임워크를 기반으로 한 프로젝트에서 사용하고 있는 소스 코드를 BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) 모델을 통해 학습시켜 소스 코드를 자동으로 생성하는 코드 생성 모델을 제안한다. 이를 통해 프로젝트의 생산성 향상 도구로 활용되어 코드 작성 시간을 줄여줄 뿐만 아니라, 개발 과정의 노하우를 모델에 축적하여 개발자의 의사소통 도구로 다양한 분야에 활용할 수 있을 것으로 사료된다.","There are many difficulties in writing code while performing various projects based on the e-government framework. Therefore, artificial intelligence(AI)-based software development tools, various cases of converting natural language used when talking to people into a programming language that computers can understand are increasing. By using OpenAI's Codex model to learn the source code owned by Github, developers install GitHub Copilot Extension in an integrated development environment(IDE) and enter annotations or function names, automatically completing and presenting the source code to be written by artificial intelligence to increase developer productivity. However, for codes that artificial intelligence has not learned, it does not present perfect codes, and sometimes AI misunderstands the developer's intentions and presents codes that need to be modified in large part. If that happens, it could rather negatively affect productivity. In this paper, we propose a code generation model that automatically generates the source code by learning the source code used in projects based on the e-government standard framework to the BERT model, as Github Copilot learned the code using the Github repository. Through this, it is believed that it can be used as a tool to improve the productivity of the project, reducing code writing time, and accumulating know-how in the development process in the model to be used in various application cases as a communication tool for developers."

(연구 방법) 본 연구는 산업 혁명 이후 도시 산업 구조의 변화에 따라 발생한 유휴산업시설의 재생과 지속가능성에 중점을 두고 있다. 연구의 첫 단계에서는 산업 유산과 유휴산업시설에 대한 이해를 넓히기 위해 기존 연구를 체계적으로 조사하였다. 이를 통해, 이 분야의 이론적 기반을 확립하고 관련 평가 지표를 도출했다. 두 번째 단계에서는 유휴산업시설의 지속가능한 발전 모델을 개발하고, 이를 평가하는 척도를 마련하였다. 이 과정에서 대규모 행사와 전시회를 중심으로 한 유휴산업시설의 재생 사례를 분석하여, 올림픽과 엑스포와 같은 세계적인 이벤트에 연계된 시설의 지속가능한 설계 모델을 구체화하였다. 또한 유휴산업시설의 재생 및 지속가능성에 대한 구체적인 방안을 제안하고자 하였다.

Consequently, many such sites have either disappeared or been transformed into commercialized tourism spots, undermining the value of industrial heritage and failing to reflect the historical and cultural characteristics of regions. This underscores the urgent need to protect and renew idle industrial facilities. The aims of this research were to develop an analytical model for the regeneration and sustainability of such facilities, identify key sustainability assessment factors in the process, and systematically analyze exemplary cases of idle industrial facility rejuvenation. (Method) This study focused on the regeneration and sustainability of idle industrial facilities resulting from the post-Industrial Revolution urban industrial structural shift.

In early studies, studies using gradients were conducted, but recently, stylization using generative networks have been developed along with the development of a generative model capable of generating high-quality facial images. Among them, JoJoGAN introduced a learning process that enables fine-tuning through the weighted sum of the reference style latent vector and random noise found through GAN inversion and showed that excellent style transformis possible using only one reference image. However, the existing weighted sum-based style combination has a problem in that the manifold expressing the style code is limited as a simple linear combination form. Therefore, the result of stylization using the potential space does not reflect the fine expression effectively and at the same time has a limit in diversity. To solve this problem, this paper proposes two methods. First, it is a method to broadly compose a style latent space by combining non-linear stylization to increase the diversity and quality of creation. This allows for different sampling in an expanded style space, improving the quality and variety of the output. Second, we used a hierarchical Transformer structure to identify spatial long-term dependencies in style combinations to generate meaningful combinations of style features. In other words, style codes are encoded by separate independent neural networks for coarse, medium and fine layers. In the proposed method, improved stylization performance was confirmed through quantitative/qualitative/subjective experiments by inducing the overall appearance to follow the original appearance and to reflect the reference style for fine details."

Carsharing appeared as a novel type of service that transformed the conventional way of personal transportation, from owning a vehicle to using an on-demand service. Allowing users to use a vehicle without owning a car, carsharing provides various social benefits such as the reduction of resource allocation inefficiencies and the alleviation of transportation problems. To strengthen such positive aspects of carsharing service, it is essential to understand an individual’s service usage pattern and reveal factors that affect users’ reuse behavior. This study investigates the factors that have an influence on carsharing reuse of users applying RFMC (Recency, Frequency, Monetary, and Clumpiness) model, the popular model for understanding the reuse likelihood of customers. Using data from a leading carsharing service provider in South Korea, we empirically analyze the effect of RFMC on carsharing reuse behavior. The findings show that recency and monetary values are negatively related to reuse while frequency is positively related to carsharing service reuse. Moreover, the impact of recency and monetary value are more salient whereas the impact of frequency is smaller among users with higher clumpiness. Based on these findings, this study elaborates on theoretical and practical implications."

However, damage and loss to farmers have not been reduced with these measures.Therefore, this study aims to address the farmers' consistent desire to develop a disease outbreak prediction model (DOPM) that can be easily utilized in the field and has high precision. The current study developed a disease outbreak prediction model (DOPM) that can find a singularity (golden time) in the data even if only one type of ICT data (Water & Feed) is properly monitored and analyzed. We found that if the time when a sharp decrease (more than 100% decrease from the previous day), confirmed through the daily feed intake data for two consecutive days (golden time = DOPM), is set as the start of the disease outbreak and preventive measures are taken quickly, this model can be used to minimize farm losses and damages better than the existing method that relies on analog data and experience. Additionally, the DOPM was confirmed to be the fastest, most sensitive, and most accurate model in the field poultry farms. As a result, we have found a method to interpret non-verbal signals of the chickens with the transformed ICT-Data in the AI-age."
장기 변동성을 반영하기 위한 확산 모델을 활용한 주가 지수 확률 분포 예측,2023,"['Deep learning', 'Time series forecasting', 'Stochastic differential equations', 'Financial time series', 'Stock market index', 'Probabilistic forecasting']",,"Many of the existing time series forecasting studies in stock market were statistical or machine learning methods based on point prediction. However, typical point forecasting methods fail to consider the distribution of data, which may ignore extreme market situations. This can be vulnerable especially for the long-term forecasting, given the high volatility in the stock market. To resolve the issue, we propose a stock index probabilistic distribution prediction framework based on the Denoising Diffusion Model, called StockGrad. Specifically, StockGrad adopt a sparse transformer encoder as feature extractor to yield zero probability for time steps that are less relevant to the prediction time step. For probability distribution prediction, our model transforms the white noise into the distribution of interest through the Markov chain using the TimeGrad time series generation methodology. Our proposed methodology can help investors make decisions on investment or risk management. Our experiments show that proposed StockGrad framework outperforms the existing deep learning probability models by about 3.71%, 1.53% and 1.71% on S&P500, NIKKEI225, and KOSPI200 stock index data sets, respectively. Also, it is experimentally demonstrated that using the sparse transformer encoder as a feature extractor captures historical time points related to predictive bulbs well, improve the performance of the long-term prediction."

However, constructing an airfoil table is not trivial for airfoil shape design problems where the number of design parameters significantly increases. In this study, a surrogate model based on artificial neural networks is developed for airfoil aerodynamic tables in rotorcraft applications. The shape of airfoils is parameterized through Class-Shape Transformation(CST) using coefficients of a Bernstein polynomial expansion. The training data is comprised of 530 shapes sampled from perturbations of the CST coefficients around ten baseline airfoils. The aerodynamic coefficients for each shape are calculated using fully-turbulent flow simulations in the subsonic and transonic regimes. The range of angles of attack also includes stall angle to include any nonlinearities in model prediction. Overall, the trained model accurately predicts aerodynamic coefficients of non-trained airfoil shapes. The variation of model accuracy is also analyzed between interpolated and extrapolated spaces."

This study endeavors to systematically formalize the concept of verisimilitude quality within literary compositions, with a primary focus on the significance of the UX pyramid. The overarching goal is to develop structured methodologies for the seamless integration of literary elements into the metaverse. Verisimilitude quality, within the domain of literary composition, epitomizes the degree of persuasive realism, distinguished by the harmonious interplay of characters, spatiotemporal settings, and the authenticity of portrayed locales. (Method) This study delves into the theoretical framework encapsulating verisimilitude in narrative theory and the significance attributed to the UX pyramid. The scope of case analysis is exclusively confined to a comprehensive evaluation of literary experiences within the digital spatial context of domestic literature museums. It aspires to systematize verisimilitude elements as integral facets of the metaverse literary experience design process and the construction of metaverse literary narratives. (Results) The verisimilitude inherent in narratives forms a complex network of experiences intricately interwoven with factors such as the perspectives of literary consumers and sociocultural norms extending beyond the narrative. Therefore, to reconfigure these elements into immersive metaverse literary experiences, it becomes imperative to undertake a meticulous analysis of the paramount significance embedded within the UX pyramid. The UX pyramid's significance encompasses a holistic model comprising five fundamental elements: connectedness, coherence, purpose, resonance, and significance. In light of these components, an analysis of digital experiential content within the current literature museums underscores the urgent need for a transformative evolution in experiential content. To facilitate this transformation, guiding the elevation of literary experiences and necessitating the concrete manifestation of significance within the UX framework. This study systematically categorizes verisimilitude as a constituent of the literary experience, founded on the significance attributed to the UX pyramid. It addresses three key dimensions: literature, users, and motivation, subsequently outlining this categorization through a meticulously planned eight-stage experiential design process. (Conclusions) Discovering meaning within literature constitutes an intensely personal and subjective pursuit, subject to individual preferences. Nonetheless, by structuring this journey as an element within the virtual reality experience and developing a versatile verisimilitude model adaptable across diverse genres, the quest for meaning holds the potential to broaden the horizons of literature. Particularly, should literature's enduring pursuit of utility find realization within the digital sphere, it offers a profound opportunity to substantially elevate global interest in Korean literature. Therefore, future research should be followed by experimental studies considering verisimilitude based on the characteristics of virtual space devices."

This study aimed to develop and externally validate a deep learning model for the detection of pneumoperitoneum using supine and erect abdominal radiography.Materials and Methods: A model that can utilize “pneumoperitoneum” and “non-pneumoperitoneum” classes was developed through knowledge distillation. To train the proposed model with limited training data and weak labels, it was trained using a recently proposed semi-supervised learning method called distillation for self-supervised and self-train learning (DISTL), which leverages the Vision Transformer. The proposed model was first pre-trained with chest radiographs to utilize common knowledge between modalities, fine-tuned, and self-trained on labeled and unlabeled abdominal radiographs. The proposed model was trained using data from supine and erect abdominal radiographs. In total, 191212 chest radiographs (CheXpert data) were used for pre-training, and 5518 labeled and 16671 unlabeled abdominal radiographs were used for fine-tuning and self-supervised learning, respectively. The proposed model was internally validated on 389 abdominal radiographs and externally validated on 475 and 798 abdominal radiographs from the two institutions. We evaluated the performance in diagnosing pneumoperitoneum using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and compared it with that of radiologists.Results: In the internal validation, the proposed model had an AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.881, 85.4%, and 73.3% and 0.968, 91.1, and 95.0 for supine and erect positions, respectively. In the external validation at the two institutions, the AUCs were 0.835 and 0.852 for the supine position and 0.909 and 0.944 for the erect position. In the reader study, the readers’ performances improved with the assistance of the proposed model.Conclusion: The proposed model trained with the DISTL method can accurately detect pneumoperitoneum on abdominal radiography in both the supine and erect positions."

However, the current design guideline of South Korea assumes a uniform threshold of wind speed or vibrational amplitude to assess the occurrence of harmful vibrations, potentially overlooking the complex vibrational patterns observed in long-span bridges. In this study, we propose a pointwise vortex-induced vibration (VIV) detection method using a deep-learning-based signalsegmentation model. Departing from conventional supervised methods of data acquisition and manual labeling, we synthesize training data by generating sinusoidal waves with an envelope to accurately represent VIV. A Fourier synchrosqueezed transform is leveraged to extract time-frequency features, which serve as input data for training a bidirectional long short-term memory model. The effectiveness of the model trained on synthetic VIV data is demonstrated through a comparison with its counterpart trained on manually labeled real datasets from an actual cable-supported bridge."

To reach at this aim, hybrid artificial intelligence models have been developed, by using a new parameter, vapor pressure. Vapor pressure efficiency has been investigated for hybrid streamflow prediction models. Streamflow prediction models have been developed by using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), and their hybrid models. Hybridization of streamflow prediction models has been made with Wavelet Transform (WT). 10 yearly daily hydrological (discharge (m³/s)), meteorological (precipitation (mm), vapor pressure (hPA)) data, and seasonality coefficient have been used as input data of streamflow prediction models. In the selection of the best streamflow prediction model, 14 different day-delayed input combinations have been established by using 10 yearly data.

In the WANN model, the vapor pressure parameter was found to reduce the error by about 18.5% and improve the forecast performance. This study has concluded that, vapor pressure may be used in the future studies as a new parameter for streamflow prediction models."
Reducing latency of neural automatic piano transcription  models,2023,"['Automatic music transcription', 'Piano transcription', 'Low-latency', 'Convolutional neural network', '자동 채보', '피아노 채보', '저지연', '합성곱 신경망']",,"Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) is a task that detects and recognizes musical note events from a given audio recording. In this paper, we focus on reducing the latency of real-time AMT systems on piano music. Although neural AMT models have been adapted for real-time piano transcription, they suffer from high latency, which hinders their usefulness in interactive scenarios. To tackle this issue, we explore several techniques for reducing the intrinsic latency of a neural network for piano transcription, including reducing window and hop sizes of Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT), modifying convolutional layer’s kernel size, and shifting the label in the time-axis to train the model to predict onset earlier. Our experiments demonstrate that combining these approaches can lower latency while maintaining high transcription accuracy. Specifically, our modified model achieved note F1 scores of 92.67 % and 90.51 % with latencies of 96 ms and 64 ms, respectively, compared to the baseline model’s note F1 score of 93.43 % with a latency of 160 ms. This methodology has potential for training AMT models for various interactive scenarios, including providing real-time feedback for piano education."

This study examines the coastal hydrodynamics and the morphological response of a wave-dominated beach with submerged breakwaters installed through field observation and quasi-3D numerical modeling. The pre-and post-storm bathymetry, water level, and offshore wave under storm forcing were collected in Bongpo Beach on the East coast of Korea and used to analyze the coastal hydrodynamic response. Four vertically equidistant layers were used in the numerical simulation, and the wave-induced current was examined using quasi-3D numerical modeling. The shore normal incident wave (east-northeast) generated strong cross-shore and longshore currents toward the hinterland of the submerged breakwater. However, the oblique incident wave (east-southeast) induced the southeastward longshore current and the sedimentation in the northeast area of the beach. The results suggested that the incident wave direction is a significant factor in determining the current and sediment transport patterns in the presence of the submerged breakwaters. Moreover, the quasi-3D numerical modeling is more appropriate for estimating the wave transformation, current, and sediment transport pattern in the coastal area with the submerged breakwater."
Improving the Anomaly Detection Performance of a Geometric Transform-based Convolutional Network,2023,"['Anomaly detection', 'calibration', 'focal loss', 'geometric transformation', 'k-WTA.']",,"Using deep learning (DL) technology, neural networks have achieved great success in various fields of computer vision. Among them, anomaly detection is a promising application of image defect analysis. The purpose of the detector is to find the out-of-distribution when predicting the probability of a DL network for abnormal samples, after some normal sample images are given for training. Geometric transformation (GT) based anomaly detection is one of the recent best methods for classifying abnormal samples among many normal ones. However, the GT method training process is unstable and too inaccurate to be used in industrial applications. The goal of this study is to suggest a method to improve the performance of a GT-based anomaly detector (GTnet). Using observations of GTnet behavior and its training properties, we propose the addition of three techniques that can improve anomaly detection performance for defect inspection in a factory production process. Specifically, k-Winners-Take-All (kWTA) was applied to the GTnet base model to resist data corruption such as dust on the sample, the temperature scaling method was added to consider correlations between GT classes with similar appearance, and loss redefinition was applied to improve the efficiency of optimal training. Accuracy was improved from 98.56% to 99.86% in the inspection of vehicle part assembly defects, which requires extremely high accuracy. Experimental evaluations were conducted to verify the performance improvement of the GT anomaly detector."

The capacity of CNTs modified with IA (IA/CNT) and composited with PANI (PANI/CNT) to remove MB dye from an aqueous solution was compared and investigated. The effects of parameters such as pH (3–10), adsorbent dose (0.8–8 g/L), initial dye concentration (10–100 mg/L), and temperature (25–55 °C) on MB adsorption were investigated. IA/CNT and PANI/CNT adsorbents were characterized by analyzes such as Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET). It was determined that the isotherm data fit the Langmuir isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacity (qmax) of PANI/CNT and IA/CNT calculated according to this model (at 25 °C) was 12.78 and 32.78 mg g−1, respectively. Thermodynamic analysis results showed that the adsorption was exothermic, feasible, and spontaneous. It can be said that the possible mechanism of MB on PANI/CNT and IA/CNT adsorbents occurs with the participation of π–π interaction, electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding."

The main causes are oxidative stress, inflammation, and degeneration. The efficacy of the stem cell secretome is promising, but the role of human neural stem cell (HNSC)- secretome in neuropathic pain is unclear. This study evaluated how the mechanism of HNSC-secretome improves neuropathic pain and locomotor function in SCI rat models through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-matrix degradation, and neurotrophic activities.Methods: A proper experimental study investigated 15 Rattus norvegicus divided into normal, control, and treatment groups (30 μL HNSC-secretome, intrathecal in the level of T10, three days post-traumatic SCI). Twentyeight days post-injury, specimens were collected, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, F2-Isoprostanes, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were analyzed. Locomotor recovery was evaluated via Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores. Neuropathic pain was evaluated using the Rat Grimace Scale.Results: The HNSC-secretome could improve locomotor recovery and neuropathic pain, decrease F2-Isoprostane (antioxidant), decrease MMP-9 and TNF-α (anti-inflammatory), as well as modulate TGF-β and BDNF (neurotrophic factor). Moreover, HNSC-secretomes maintain the extracellular matrix of SCI by reducing the matrix degradation effect of MMP-9 and increasing the collagen formation effect of TGF-β as a resistor of glial scar formation.Conclusions: The present study demonstrated the mechanism of HNSC-secretome in improving neuropathic pain and locomotor function in SCI through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-matrix degradation, and neurotrophic activities."

In order to reduce the costs of acquisition and minimise the disposal of adsorbents, prepared BSM composite were employed in the sequestration of Levofloxacin (LEVO) from aqueous environment. The physico-chemical features and the adsorption mechanisms of prepared BSM, prior and after the adsorption of LEVO molecules were revealed by Scanning Electron Microscopy and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy techniques. The influence of adsorption parameters including BSM dose, initial concentration, temperature and residence time were studied. The removal of LEVO was significantly influenced by all parameters. Equilibrium data has its fitness in the following order: Redlich-Peterson ˃ Langmuir ˃ Freundlich models. The maximum adsorption capacity of BSM for LEVO was 104.13 mg/g. The kinetic analysis indicates best fittings for pseudo-second-order model suggesting chemisorption as controlled mechanism. Besides, liquid film and intra-particle diffusion had a vital influence on the LEVO sequestration process.

Gly-Pro-Val-Gly-Pro-Ser Peptide Fish Collagen Improves Skin Moisture and Wrinkles with Ameliorated the Oxidative Stress and Pro-inflammatory Factors in Skin Photoaging Mimic Models,2023,"['collagen', 'oxidative stress', 'photoaging']",,"This study aimed to investigate whether low molecular fish collagen peptide (FC) from Oreochromis niloticus had protective effects on skin of photoaging mimic models. We observed that FC supplementation improved antioxidant enzymes activities and regulated the pro-inflammatory cytokines [e.g., tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6] by reducing the protein expressions of pro-inflammatory factors IkBa, p65, and cyclooxygenase-2 in ultraviolet-B (UV-B) irradiated in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, FC increased hyaluronic acid, sphingomyelin, and skin hydration by increasing the mRNA expression of hyaluronic acid synthases 1∼3, serine palmitoyltransferase 1, delta 4-desaturase, sphingolipid 1, and protein expressions of ceramide synthase 4, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, -2, and -9. In UV-B irradiated in vitro and in vivo, FC up-regulated the protein expression of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase, c-Fos, c-Jun, and MMP pathways and up-regulated that of the transforming growth factor-b receptor I, collagen type I, procollagen type I, and small mothers against decapentaplegic homolog pathways. Our results suggest that FC can be effective against UV-B induced skin photoaging by improving skin dryness and wrinkle formation through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties."

ACT 코칭 모델은 삼위일체 하나님을 알도록 하기 위한 것으로서, 하나님·예수님·성령님을 기본 전제로 개념화하였다. 내러티브 코칭은 첫째, 존재론적 의미를 추구한다는 점에서 유용하다. 제 3세대 코칭 방법으로 주목받고 있는 내러티 브 코칭 방법은 성찰성을 특징으로 하며 당면한 문제해결보다는 정체성과 존재의 본 질과 의미형성을 추구하는 코칭 방법이다. 둘째, 크리스천 코칭의 관점에 기본이 되는 성경의 세계관은 내러티브로 구성되어 있으며, 코칭 대화 가운데 성경의 내러티브를 활용하여 코치이의 내러티브를 변화시킬 수 있다. 창조, 구원, 성화 내러티브와 은유 와 상징은 코치이의 현실을 재구성하는데 도움을 준다. 본 크리스천 코칭 모델은 크리스천 세계관에 입각하여 가치관을 정립하고, 현실을 인식하며 목표를 설정하고 계획을 수립하여 그리스도 안에서 새롭게 창조된 존재로서 정체성을 확립하며 삶의 내러티브를 창조와 구원과 성화의 내러티브로 재구성하도록 돕는다.","The purpose of this research is to develop a Christian coaching model that utilizes a narrative coaching method so that adults who know and are transformed by ACT can contribute to a child’s faith education through the integrated approach of theology and coaching. To achieve this research objective, two research queries were set. First, how do we conceptualize ACT coaching? Second, based on this conceptualization of ACT coaching, how do we develop a ACT coaching model and confirm its feasibility? This ACT coaching model is intended to make the Triune ACT known, and to conceptualize ACT, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit as basic premises. Based on these conceptualizations, the initials A-C-T, representing GOD’s plan, Changing in Jesus Christ, Training with Holy Sprit The research methods used to conceptualize and develop this coaching model includes the use of literature review, simulation training, brainstorming, feedback from professional coaching groups, and group discussions. Its content was confirmed and verified by four Christian coaches and a total of 40 questions were developed. First, narrative coaching is useful in that it pursues existential meaning. As a third-generation coaching method, narrative coaching is characterized by reflexivity. It is a coaching method that focuses more on identity, existence, and meaning formation than on immediate problem-solving. As a second element, the biblical worldview, which is the foundation of Christian coaching, is narrative-based. By using the biblical narrative during coaching conversations, the narrative of those receiving coaching can be changed. Narratives of Creation, salvation, sanctification, and metaphors help reconstruct coachee reality. This Christian coaching model builds on the Christian worldview, establishes values, recognizes reality, sets up purpose, establishes plans, and helps to establish identity as a new person in Christ. This will help reconstruct the coachee's narrative into a narrative of creation, salvation, and sanctification."

Predictive modeling as a tool to assess polymer–polymer and polymer–drug interactions for tissue engineering applications,2023,"['Polymer blends', 'Polymer–polymer interactions', 'Miscibility', 'Classification', 'Machine learning']",,"The success of tissue engineering scaffolds for wound healing relies on balanced physicochemical properties and the addition of small molecules. These two require an in-depth understanding of the interactions between the different components of the scaffolds for favorable and synergistic actions. Thus, the choice of polymeric blends is crucial to tune the properties of the resulting scaffolds. Miscibility of the polymer blends can be used to assess polymer–polymer interactions for effective scaffold engineering and cell–material interactions. The focus of this study was to apply machine learning (ML) methods to classify and predict the miscibility of polymer blends, namely poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-valerate)/fucoidan (PHBV/FUC), polyhydroxybutyrate/kappa-carrageenan (PHB/KCG), and cellulose acetate/polyamide (CA/PA). Physicochemical parameters assessed through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal analysis, and mechanical properties were used as input data. Depending on blend film compositions, the polymers were either partially miscible or completely immiscible. Six supervised classification algorithms were trained on the data with Scikit-learn. The random forest classifier outperformed the other algorithms with the optimal performance metrics. A simple multiple linear regression model was applied to polymer–drug interaction data. Preliminary results indicated that regression models could be correlated with ultraviolet (UV) absorbance of polymer–drug solutions."

Online Unstructured Data Analysis Models with KoBERT and Word2vec: A Study on Sentiment Analysis of Public Opinion in Korean,2023,"['KoBERT', 'Word2vec', 'Public opinion analysis', 'Sentiment classification']",,"Online news articles and comments play a vital role in shaping public opinion. Numerous studies have conducted online opinion analyses using these as raw data. Bidirectional encoder representations from transformer (BERT)-based sentiment analysis of public opinion have recently attracted significant attention. However, owing to its limited linguistic versatility and low accuracy in domains with insufficient learning data, the application of BERT to Korean is challenging. Conventional public opinion analysis focuses on term frequency; hence, low-frequency words are likely to be excluded because their importance is underestimated. This study aimed to address these issues and facilitate the analysis of public opinion regarding Korean news articles and comments. We propose a method for analyzing public opinion using word2vec to increase the word-frequency-centered analytical limit in conjunction withKoBERT, which is optimized for Korean language by improving BERT. Naver news articles and comments were analyzed using a sentiment classification model developed on the KoBERT framework. The experiment demonstrated a sentiment classification accuracy of over 90%.

This paper proposes adeep neural network-based methodology to accurately classify PPG signals using a Fourier theory-based time–frequency(TF) spectrogram. This work uses the Fourier decomposition method (FDM) to transform a PPG signal into a TF spectrogram.In the proposed work, the last three layers of the pre-trained deep neural network, namely, GoogleNet, DenseNet, andAlexNet, are modified and then used to classify the PPG signal into normotension, pre-hypertension, and hypertension. Theproposed framework is trained and tested using the MIMIC-III and PPG–BP databases using five-fold training and testing.Out of the three deep neural networks, the proposed framework with the DenseNet-201 network performs best, with a testaccuracy of 96.5%. The proposed work uses FDM to compute the TF spectrogram to accurately separate the motion artifactsand noise components from a noise-corrupted PPG signal. Capturing more frequency components that contain moreinformation from PPG signals makes the deep neural networks extract better and more meaningful features. Thus, training adeep neural network model with clean PPG signal features improves the generalized capability of a BP classification modelwhen tested in realtime."

"The Role of Human Neural Stem Cell Secretomes on the Repair of Spinal Cord Injury Post-laminectomy in Rattus norvegicus Through the Analysis of Basso–Beattie–Bresnahan Score Locomotors, Interleukin-10, Matrix Metalloproteinase 9, and Transforming Growt",2023,"['Secretome', 'Locomotors', 'Interleukin-10', 'Matrix metalloproteinase 9', 'Transforming growth factor-β']",,"Study Design: Experimental animal study.Purpose: This study aims to investigate the effects of treatment with human neural stem cell (HNSC) secretomes on subacute spinal cord injury (SCI) post-laminectomy by analyzing interleukin-10 (IL-10), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and Basso–Beattie–Bresnahan (BBB) score locomotors as expressions of neurological recovery.Overview of Literature: In the United States, SCI has a recovery rate of 0.08%, tetraplegia 58.7%, and paraplegia 40.6%. Therapeutic approaches to SCI have focused on modulating the secondary cascade to prevent neurological deterioration and glial scar formation. Increasing evidence has shown that the success of cell-based SCI therapy is attributed to the secretomes rather than the cells themselves, but the effect of treatment with HNSC secretomes in SCI is unclear.Methods: This experimental study investigated 15 Rattus norvegicus rats that were divided into three groups: (1) normal, (2) SCI+nonsecretome, and (3) SCI+secretome (30 μL, intrathecal Th10). Model subacute SCI post-laminectomy was performed in 60 seconds using an aneurysm Yasargil clip with a closing forceps weighing 65 g (150 kdyn). At 35 days post-injury, the specimens were collected, and the immunohistochemicals of IL-10, MMP9, and TGF-β were analyzed. Motor recovery was evaluated based on the BBB scores.Results: The SCI post-laminectomy of rats treated with HNSC secretomes showed improvements in their locomotor recovery based on the BBB scores (p =0.000, mean=18.4) and decreased MMP9 (p =0.015) but had increased the levels of IL-10 (p =0.045) and TGF-β (p =0.01).Conclusions: These results indicate that the factors associated with the HNSC secretomes can mitigate their pathophysiological processes of secondary damage after SCI and improve the locomotor functional outcomes in rats."

The research on image forgery detection using CNN, a deep learning network, and research on detecting and localizing forgery in pixel units are in progress. Among them, CAT-Net, which learns the discrete cosine transform coefficients of images together with images, was released in 2022. The DCT coefficients presented by CAT-Net are combined with the JPEG artifact learning module and the backbone model as pre-learning, and the weights are fixed. The dataset used for pre-training is not included in the public dataset, and the backbone model has a relatively large number of network parameters, which causes overfitting in a small dataset, hindering generalization performance. In this paper, this learning module is designed to learn the characterization depending on the DCT domain in real-time during network training without pre-training. The DCT RRU-Net proposed in this paper is a network that combines RRU-Net which detects forgery by learning only images and JPEG artifact learning module. It is confirmed that the network parameters are less than those of CAT-Net, the detection performance of forgery is better than that of RRU-Net, and the generalization performance for various datasets improves through the network architecture and training method of DCT RRU-Net."

K-pop music videos, centered on performances and often referred to as ‘the music of the eye,’ have established themselves as a key medium of K-pop. Korean language and culture education is shifting away from traditional text-centered literacy pedagogy, utilizing a variety of media, including K-pop music videos. However, within the enduring effect of language-centered education, the potential of music videos as a multi-layered and multifaceted techno-cultural media text yet to be fully realized. Rather, they tend to be perceived more as supplementary materials. To address this issue, this study adopts the perspective of critical multiliteracies, exploring the educational potential of K-pop music videos, where discourse, culture, technology, industry, art, and technology are intertwined in a complex and dynamic manner. Furthermore it seeks to offer theoretical and pedagogical directions to move beyond conventional text-centered literacy instruction. In alignment with the conceptual underpinnings of multiliteracies, the study defines the goals of Korean language and culture education based on K-pop music videos as ‘cultivating competencies in critical multiliteracies through the process of enjoying, critically analyzing, and creating new media from K-pop music videos.’ As a conceptual foundation for pedagogical praxis, the study proposes a set of methods for analyzing K-pop music videos as a multimodal text as well as a multi-layered cultural text, drawing on literature on gender and cultural hybridity. On top of these theoretical tasks, the study proposes using K-pop music videos as an integral media repertoire for teaching and learning in various sociocultural contexts. This can be achieved by seamlessly integrating the four stages of multiliteracies teaching--(1) situated practice, (2) explicit instruction, (3) critical framing, and (4) transformed practice--into Korean language and culture education. We hope that this study can play an instrumental role in enhancing the depth and breadth of K-pop music video-based multiliteracies education, as well as fostering collaboration among Korean language and culture teachers and researchers worldwide."

Methods First, 137 literature related to ‘exploration’ were analyzed and an integrated initial inquiry model that could be universally applied was developed. The applicability of the model to 20 field teachers in various fields was reviewed and internal validation was conducted. Afterwards, an inquiry class was formed based on the model and applied to three teams of middle and high school students to conduct external validation of the inquiry model. Results The developed TSU model goes through three stages: problem recognition (Thinking), problem solving (Solving), and knowledge utilization (Using). Each stage includes two of the six elements: theme setting and research design, research execution and results arrangement, knowledge application and communication. The elements of the inquriy are selectable, the starting stages can be set differently, and the entire quest process is characterized by a spiral cycle. These characteristics were considered to be applicable to various fields as a differentiated part from the existing inquiry model. It was confirmed that the aspects appearing in the actually applied inquiry class are the same as the context of the existing inquiry model and do not deviate from the essence of inquiry. Conclusions The TSU model is an inquiry model that can be applied to various fields and school levels, and has significance in integrating the research models presented so far into one. In order for the inquiry model to be well applied to the field, a field should be prepared to activate the community of teachers who share inquiry lessons and to collect and unfold records from the field. In addition, in order to increase the validity of the inquiry model, it is proposed as a follow-up study to transform and expand the inquiry model through various school levels and various fields, or apply it to the online environment and other cultures."

A pipeline of data transformation algorithms was constructed to convert raw S2S prediction data into the training data processed with several statistical distribution. A dimensionality reduction algorithm for selecting features through rankings of correlation coefficients between the observed and the input data. The training model in the study was designed with TimeDistributed wrapper applied to all convolutional layers of U-Net: The TimeDistributed wrapper allows a U-Net convolutional layer to be directly applied to 5-dimensional time series data while maintaining the time axis of data, but every input should be at least 3D in U-Net. We found that Robust and Standard transformation algorithms are most suitable for improving S2S predictions. The dimensionality reduction based on feature selections did not significantly improve predictions of daily precipitation for six climate models and even worsened predictions of daily maximum and minimum temperatures. While deep learning-based postprocessing was also improved MME S2S precipitation predictions, it did not have a significant effect on temperature predictions, particularly for the lead time of weeks 1 and 2. Further research is needed to develop an optimal deep learning model for improving S2S temperature predictions by testing various models and parameters."

Anchoring our research in the Context-Input- Process-Product evaluation model, a multiple case study approach was adopted.[Results] In the context of evaluation phase, the rise of diversity organizations was seen as a spontaneous response to cater to the shifting demands of higher education. From an input evaluation perspective, the objectives were deemed appropriate, yet there was a noticeable lack of internal resources and support mechanisms. When evaluating processes, they primarily functioned as consultative entities, thereby influencing their capacity to shape institutional decisions. Furthermore, product evaluation revealed that these organizations made commendable strides. This includes advocating for legislative reforms, revamping academic curricula, publicizing official statements, developing diversity index/metric, and orchestrating various publications and public events.[Conclusion] Based on this foundation, it was suggested that the university's diversity policy, beyond its educational impact, should serve as a keyword for university innovation."

In particular, during the 7th and 8th administrations, dedicated organizations for smart cities were separated from regional information organizations, and some even experienced the separation or decline of the functions of existing regional information organizations. This confusing phenomenon raises questions as to why organizations are unable to sustain growth or maintain their existence in the face of increasing internal and external demands for digital transformation, and why some regions experience the separation or decline of the functions of existing regional information organizations. This study applies the organizational life cycle model to interpret the process and characteristics of changes in regional information organizations in 25 districts of Seoul from the past to the present. By analyzing the factors for the growth or decline of the changed organizations after the elarboration stage of the organizational life cycle, this study diagnoses the current stage of regional information organizations, and derives policy directions and recommendations."

Most research to date has focused on identifying the concepts and components of digital literacy and emphasizing its importance, however, there remains a significant gap in research that specifically proposes teaching methods. Thus, this study aimed to develop a digital literacy education model to enhance digital problem-solving skills. For this purpose, educational models, such as the design thinking model, maker education, and the OECD’s AAR  cycle were reviewed to derive a draft model consisting of “context - problem clarification - solution creation - reflection.”  Three experts reviewed this draft model for improvement and refinement. To assess the feasibility of the finalized model, we collected examples of digital literacy education in domestic schools and analyzed how each step of the model reflected technology integration. The results showed that the 3CR model is feasible in the school education. The improvement needed to spread the educational model was discussed. The 3CR model may enable learners to perceive the digital environment as a problem-solving context. This is expected to increase learners’ problem-solving skills and foster the attitudes and knowledge necessary for selecting and using digital tools for problem-solving purposes."

S. Indochina refugee program. Vietnamese Americans have taken a different path to American citizenship from other Asian Americans because they entered the U. S. as refugees. The U. S. military intervention in the Vietnam War was the original cause of turning tens of thousands of South Vietnamese people into refugees. The U. S. Indochina refugee program provided a guideline for the Vietnamese to be an ideal refugee, and eventually become a good American of Asian descent. This article draws on the works of scholars who are engaged in critical refugee studies and Asian American studies as well as on the works of American historians of political and diplomatic history. Recently, American historians have explored how the U. S. Indochina refugee program and the 1980 Refugee Act could be adopted in the late 1970s in spite of the lack of support from Congress and public opinion. A group of Asian American scholars involved in critical refugee studies pinpoints the U. S. military intervention in the Vietnam War as the root cause of the Indochina refugee crisis. As the U. S. endorsed the human rights of all refugees in the Refugee Act of 1980, the human rights cause and humanitarian intention of the Indochina refugee program have helped restore America’s moral standing in the world. It proclaimed that America saved its South Vietnamese allies from the threat of Communism and presented them with freedom and rights. The U. S. Indochina refugee program had the effect of producing anti-Communist Vietnamese refugee subjects as well as obscuring the violent past of the U. S. intervention in the Vietnam War."

Therefore, this study divided the domestic logistics companies into 4 groups by sector and 3 groups by size, and added global logistics companies to analyze efficiency using the DEA-SBM (Slack Based Model) based on meaningful and objective indicators from financial statements. The efficiency analysis of all 58 logistics companies from 2013 to 2022 showed an upward trend for domestic comprehensive logistics service companies and trucking companies, a flat trend for freight forwarding companies, and a downward trend for warehousing companies. Overall, domestic logistics companies have not reached an adequate level of efficiency in terms of outputs relative to inputs. On the other hand, the relative efficiency of global logistics companies shows a stable trend, but the overall distribution of inefficiencies is much lower than that of domestic logistics companies, indicating that they are operating efficiently. Through this study, Korean logistics companies have identified the need for more active policy support from the government along with their own efforts to improve competitiveness and structural reforms. In addition, both domestic and foreign logistics companies have experienced fluctuations in efficiency before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, however, it is necessary to benchmark domestic logistics companies against the low efficiency fluctuations and rapid improvement results of global logistics companies through digital transformation, logistics system improvement using A.I. and Big Data, and Logistics & Supply Chain improvement processes such as customer contact response management."

To this end, this study critically reviews existing discussions related to the digital divide and re-examines the concept of the divide in the digital transformation era. Based on the analysis results, the following policy directions are proposed. First, most research related to the existing digital divide focuses on phenomena that occur at the group level, and as a result, policies are mainly post-hoc approaches to alleviate problems. This study proposes that cause-centered policy design is necessary to actively respond to the problems of the divide. Second, this study proves the robust effect of the divide in explaining people’s attitudes toward IIT adoption. While the major variables discussed in previous studies related to the digital divide effectively explain the IIT divide, it was found that they did not explain acceptance. Such results show why we should be interested in the concept of a divide in the current situation where we can only accept new technologies. Third, the IIT divide should be understood as a social phenomenon that is composed of individual inherent characteristics, technological characteristics, and contextual situations around users. There is thus a limit to any single prescription by the government. Therefore, this study proposes that a clear and focused role of the government is needed through a sophisticated diagnosis of the IIT divide."

We constructed a two-part autoregressive cross-lagged model with a log-transformed EQ-5D (EuroQol-5 Dimension) index. Results: Older adults who reported full-health state were more likely to maintain their health state over time. Older adults with two types of health-risk behaviors, both in full and non-full health states, were more likely to maintain or increase their health-risk behaviors in the following years. Those with three or more health-risk behaviors tended to rate their HRQoL higher in the following years. Conclusions: A significant reciprocal relationship exists between health-risk behaviors and health-related quality of life in older adults."

In addition, when the form of data is text, it is required to compress and summarize the text. In this paper, we construct an efficient system for compressing and summarizing text composed of Korean using the Transformer Encoder-Decoder-based KoBART (Korean Bidirectional and Auto-Regulatory Transformers) model. This system consisted of a preprocessor that performs an extraction summary and a KoBART model that performs a generation summary. The preprocessor performs an extraction summary based on the sentence when a specific phrase appears considering the linguistic characteristics of the Korean language, and the KoBART model performs a generation summary on texts not processed by the preprocessor. The proposed system used the preprocessor considering the linguistic features of Korean and the KoBART model, which is a pre-learning language model, to compress and summarize text composed of Korean, and showed superior performance compared to the general extraction summary model and generation summary model. This suggests that a method of analyzing and utilizing the characteristics of a specific country's language in more detail can expect better results than using only a pre-learning language model with excellent performance. It is expected that this paper will be a leading study in spreading the synergy of the pre-learning language model with linguistic features and excellent performance."

However, as the size of pretrained language models increases, problems typically arise with fine-tuning. Because fine tuning processes for language models require learning the entire parameter set, training takes longer as the size of a model increases, and storage space requirements also increase accordingly. To solve these problems, in this study, we propose a method to reduce the number of parameters of a language model and allow it to learn more efficiently. The proposed approach enables more efficient learning of conversational knowledge by combining an adapter and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) without learning parameters corresponding to Transformer-based language models. We evaluated the performance of an implementation of the proposed approach using the MultiWOZ 2.0 benchmark dataset, which is commonly used to evaluate the performance of task-oriented dialogue systems. The results show that despite learning with 8% fewer parameters compared to fine-tuning an existing model, the proposed method showed similar performance within the 2% error range. These results demonstrate that the efficiency of the proposed model improved dramatically in terms of learning time and storage space requirements."

The based model demonstrates lightweight performance through a structure that combines features of convolutional neural networks with features of Vision Transformer.

Similarly, in the field of human pose estimation, Vision Transformer-based ViTPose maintains the best performance in all human pose estimation benchmarks such as COCO, OCHuman, and MPII. However, because Vision Transformer has a heavy model structure with a large number of parameters and requires a relatively large amount of computation, it costs users a lot to train the model. Accordingly, the based model overcame the insufficient Inductive Bias calculation problem, which requires a large amount of computation by Vision Transformer, with Local Representation through a convolutional neural network structure. Finally, the proposed model obtained a mean average precision of 0.694 on the MS COCO benchmark with 3.28 GFLOPs and 9.72 million parameters, which are 1/5 and 1/9 the number compared to ViTPose, respectively."

Additionally, we propose that the level of life satisfaction from digital transformation could mediate the relationship between digital literacy and their attitude towards it. To test these hypotheses, we utilize raw data from the ""2022 Digital Divide Survey"" conducted by the Korea Intelligence and Information Society Agency.

The results show that an individual's level of digital literacy positively influences their attitude towards digital transformation, and the level of life satisfaction due to digital transformation mediates about 64% of the total effect of digital literacy on this attitude. Consequently, this study suggests policy implications for successfully integrating digital transformation into our society. It emphasizes the need to develop policy alternatives that consider factors related to digital transformation at the individual level, the importance of enhancing national digital literacy, and prioritizing the development and dissemination of digital transformation services that citizens can tangibly experience in their daily lives."

In addition, in the case of the double segmentation model, the defense of adversarial attacks is more difficult, but security studies related to this topic have not received attention. In this study, we perform FGSM attacks ony brain tumor segmentation models and employ input image transformation and gradient regularization as defenses against these attacks. The proposed application of JPEG compression and Gaussian filters effectively removes adversarial noise while maintaining performance in the original images. Moreover, the input image transformation method, when compared to the conventional gradient regularization model for achieving robustness, not only exhibits a higher defense performance but also offers the advantage of being applicable without the need for model retraining. Through this research, we identify vulnerabilities in the security of medical artificial intelligence and propose ensuring robustness that can be applied in the preprocessing stage of the model."
A Novel Two-Stage Training Method for Unbiased Scene Graph Generation via Distribution Alignment,2023,"['Scene Graph Generation', 'Transformer-based Architecture', 'Distribution Alignment', 'Model-independent', 'Visual Genome Dataset.']",,"Scene graphs serve as semantic abstractions of images and play a crucial role in enhancing visual comprehension and reasoning. However, the performance of Scene Graph Generation is often compromised when working with biased data in real-world situations. While many existing systems focus on a single stage of learning for both feature extraction and classification, some employ Class-Balancing strategies, such as Re-weighting, Data Resampling, and Transfer Learning from head to tail. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that decouples the feature extraction and classification phases of the scene graph generation process. For feature extraction, we leverage a transformer-based architecture and design an adaptive calibration function specifically for predicate classification. This function enables us to dynamically adjust the classification scores for each predicate category. Additionally, we introduce a Distribution Alignment technique that effectively balances the class distribution after the feature extraction phase reaches a stable state, thereby facilitating the retraining of the classification head. Importantly, our Distribution Alignment strategy is model-independent and does not require additional supervision, making it applicable to a wide range of SGG models. Using the scene graph diagnostic toolkit on Visual Genome and several popular models, we achieved significant improvements over the previous state-of-the-art methods with our model. Compared to the TDE model, our model improved mR@100 by 70.5% for PredCls, by 84.0% for SGCls, and by 97.6% for SGDet tasks."

The volume, valence, and variance of eWOM were measured by the number of reviews, average rating, and rating variance, respectively, while the sentiment of eWOM was measured by the average sentiment scores derived by the BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. As a result, it was recognized that we have to be careful in interpreting the analysis results using secondary data, because the units of measurement of the 4 dimensions(the number of reviews, average rating, rating variance, and average sentiment) of eWOM are not all same, and the 4 dimensions are highly correlated with each other. By comparing the estimation results of three analysis models: regression model for aggregate data, panel regression model and panel error correction model for weekly panel data, it was found that the effects of 4 dimensions of eWOM may differ depending on the analysis method. The analysis result from the panel error correction model showed that only the volume of eWOM(number of reviews) had a significant effect on the number of audiences. The results of this study empirically show that considering the characteristics of the data used and the selection of an appropriate research method are important for accurate analysis, especially when we are trying to analyze the effects of the dimensions of eWOM on the movie box office success using secondary data about online movie reviews."

Kagan’s study compared the educational effects on Christian teenagers when a Jewish rabbi conducted the education himself in the 1950s. Kagan reported that significant attitude change occurred when participants were able to express their honest feelings and thoughts in dialogue. Boys and Lee conducted a long-term education program with 11 Jewish educators and 11 Catholic educators.They reported how relationship building and learning together had a significant impact on deepening understanding and changing thoughts. Van der Ven and Ziebertz categorized the monoreligious model, the multireligious model, and the interreligious model and theorized that the interreligious model could bring change and be necessary in modern society.[Conclusions] As a result, it is observed that all of these early studies demonstrated that interreligious education is ‘education for transformation.’ It is also about encountering lived religion that is embodied in each participant. Transformation happens when perspective exchange and critical self-reflection take place among them."

The development of debt recovery prediction models offers several advantages, including the establishment and implementation of an allocation strategy, the provision of customer solutions, and the creation of a commission (i.e., a fee paid to the debt collectors) payment system. This study proposes three models for predicting debt recovery that offer varying advantages based on explanatory power and predictive ability. Firstly, it is suggested that Credit Scoring (CS), a scoring model that has been widely used in the financial sector for over 60 years, can also be applied to develop a debt recovery prediction model for debt collection agencies and has excellent explanatory power. Secondly, the latest machine learning algorithms are utilized to enhance predictive power, while eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques are employed to augment the explanatory power of the machine learning model. Thirdly, a new model is proposed that combines the variable transformation technique of the credit scoring model (CS) with machine learning algorithms to improve predictive performance while retaining explanatory power. This new model also demonstrates a meaningful distinction between the recovery amount and recovery rate, which are the primary business goals of debt collection agencies."

The purpose of this study is to focus the analysis on how emotions actually change in the process of resolving the client’s global distress, and to investigate whether the process is being followed based on the sequential emotional processing model proposed by Pascual-Leone and Greenberg(2007). For research purposes, a qualitative case study was chosen to aid in understanding the phenomenon deeply and to capture the overall characteristics. The study thoroughly examined and analyzed the actual experiences of the client and her process of change. The analysis revealed that the client’s emotional change generally followed the emotional transformation process according to the sequential emotional processing model, and as the emotions were processed productively, the underlying true desires were expressed, and positive evaluations and positive feelings about the self emerged. The differences from the presented model are that the relief of guilt was seen as a key process when dealing with clients’ avoided anger, and that anxiety about being abandoned and guilty were core primary emotions that can be dealt with in the shame-fear phase of the proposed model. And finally in this case, feeling futility acted creatively and productively to accept the self and move toward subjectivity. Through this case study, it was identified that there is a specific sequence in which emotions change in a productive direction in the emotional processing procedure and it was confirmed that leading a client through the theoretically confirmed sequential procedure of emotional processing can be an important intervention direction in counseling."

When conventional long short-term memory (LSTM) autoencoders are used for detecting anomalies in time series data, the input data cannot be reconstructed appropriately when the sequence length is large. Recently, the attention mechanism was proposed to solve this problem encountered in LSTM autoencoders. In the current study, the anomaly detection performance of railway vehicle air compressors was improved using the attention mechanism. The data reconstruction performance of the LSTM autoencoder model was compared with that of the LSTM autoencoder model with the attention mechanism and the transformer model comprising only the attention mechanism by using the sensor data of an air compressor of the Airport Railroad Express train in Seoul, Korea. For artificially generated abnormal data, three anomaly scenarios were successfully detected using the transformer model, which exhibited the best data reconstruction performance among the three models. The results confirmed that transformer models with attention mechanisms can detect anomalies in the air compressors of railway vehicles in a timely manner."

Readers can easily understand a document if we provide them with its title in their preferred styles and the languages. In this research, we propose a cross-lingual and style-based title generation model using multiple adapters. To train the model, we need a parallel corpus in several languages with different styles. It is quite difficult to construct this kind of parallel corpus; however, a monolingual title generation corpus of the same style can be built easily. Therefore, we apply a zero-shot strategy to generate a title in a different language and with a different style for an input document. A baseline model is Transformer consisting of an encoder and a decoder, pre-trained by several languages. The model is then equipped with multiple adapters for translation, languages, and styles. After the model learns a translation task from parallel corpus, it learns a title generation task from monolingual title generation corpus. When training the model with a task, we only activate an adapter that corresponds to the task. When generating a cross-lingual and style-based title, we only activate adapters that correspond to a target language and a target style. An experimental result shows that our proposed model is only as good as a pipeline model that first translates into a target language and then generates a title. There have been significant changes in natural language generation due to the emergence of large-scale language models. However, research to improve the performance of natural language generation using limited resources and limited data needs to continue. In this regard, this study seeks to explore the significance of such research."

SRPAttention-GAN 모델은 저해상도의 철근 이미지를 고해상도 이미지로 변환하여 YOLOv5 모델에 학습시켜 검출 성능을 높인다. 실험 결과 SRPAttention-GAN 모델은 기존의 SRResNet-GAN 모델에 비해 PSNR이 약 0.3dB 더 높아졌음을 확인하였다. 또한, 원본 이미지와 제안 모델에서 생성한 이미지를 YOLOv5에 학습시켜 F1과 정밀도에서 더욱 개선된 결과를 얻을 수 있었으며, 이를 통해 철근의 끝점 검출 정확도를 향상시켰다.","Many studies are currently underway on unmanned automation to reduce the production of defective products during the machining process in rebar factories. In previous studies, a vision camera using YOLOv3 was employed to detect the endpoint of rebar images and determine whether the rebar was twisted.

In this paper, we propose a novel model called SRPAttention-GAN. This model transforms low-quality rebar images into high-resolution images and trains the YOLOv5 model to enhance detection performance. Experimental results confirmed that the PSNR of the SRPAttention-GAN model was approximately 0.3db higher than the existing SRResNet-GAN model. Furthermore, by training YOLOv5 on both the original images and the images generated by the proposed model, we were able to obtain improved results on the F1 and Precision, thereby enhancing the accuracy of rebar endpoint detection."

However, SAR images are difficult to interpret because there are no color information and not easy to distinguish objects. In order to solve this problem, studies for colorizing SAR images using deep learning techniques have recently been conducted. CycleGAN, which has been used in conventional unsupervised learning, is not suitable for SAR images with geometric distortion due to its limited geometric transformation because of its cyclic structure. In addition, the PatchGAN discriminator, widely used in image translation models, is unsuitable for satellite images with complex shape changes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a model that applies a SPatchGAN discriminator that discriminates images through statistical features of images based on the CUT that has advantages in geometric transformation. For performance comparison with existing models, the models were trained for the SpaceNet, a public dataset, and then analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Experimental results showed that the proposed model improved performance subjectively and objectively, compared to existing models."

These torque and drag magnitude is determined by variations such as the well trajectory geometry, drilling mud, drillstring type and kick-off point. Therefore, it is essential to consider these variations for designing directional well trajectory.

Analysis indicates that torque and drag could be minimized by using high lubricity drilling mud, kick-off point appropriate according to the well geometry and possible minimize dogleg severity.

This algorithm improves the noise attenuation performance by using the FNN (Full-connected Neural Network) deep learning algorithm instead of the existing adaptive filter after wavelet transform. After wavelet transforming the input signal for each short-time period, noise is removed from a single input audio signal containing noise by using a 1024-1024-512-neuron FNN deep learning model. This transforms the time-domain voice signal into the time-frequency domain so that the noise characteristics are well expressed, and effectively predicts voice in a noisy environment through supervised learning using the conversion parameter of the pure voice signal for the conversion parameter. In order to verify the performance of the noise reduction system proposed in this study, a simulation program using Tensorflow and Keras libraries was written and a simulation was performed. As a result of the experiment, the proposed deep learning algorithm improved Mean Square Error (MSE) by 30% compared to the case of using the existing adaptive filter and by 20% compared to the case of using the STFT (Short-Time Fourier Transform) transform. effect was obtained."

Real-time unmanned aerial vehicle flight path prediction using a bi-directional long short-term memory network with error compensation,2023,"['unmanned aerial vehicle', 'path prediction', 'Bessel coordinate transform', 'online training', 'long short-term memory']",,"In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomous flight technology has been applied in many fields. However, in the process of autonomous operation, the UAV may deviate from the set flight path due to various disturbance factors, which results in mission failure. In order to find the abnormal situation in time and take corresponding measures, it is necessary to monitor the operation state of the UAV. Predicting the UAV flight path is the main monitoring method at present; however, the accuracy and real-time of the existing prediction methods are limited. Therefore, this paper proposes an error compensation Bessel bidirectional long short-term memory real-time path prediction model deployed in ground stations. First, because of inconsistency of the units in all directions of the original positioning information provided by global positioning system, the Bessel geodetic coordinate transformation is introduced to unify the units of three-dimensional coordinate data, so as to improve the prediction accuracy. Second, considering the problems of poor data quality and data missing in the operation process, the least square fitting method is used to supplement and correct the positioning coordinate data to obtain more reliable and accurate path observation values as the model input. Finally, a deep learning path prediction model based on bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network is constructed, and the appropriate network parameters are determined with the prediction accuracy and time as evaluation indicators. In order to further improve the prediction accuracy, a compensator based on proportional integral differential error control theory is designed according to the output characteristics of the BiLSTM network, which is used for providing compensation values for the prediction results of the model. The training and testing results using the actual flight data of UAV operation show that, under the experimental environment built, the model proposed in this paper can complete the UAV flight path prediction with root mean square error < 1 meter within 0.1 second, and has better performance and higher prediction accuracy than other neural network models."

In this study, a nondestructive methodology was created by combining ATR-FT-IR (attenuated total reflectance- Fourier transform infrared), and Raman spectroscopy for the terpenoids assessment in medicinal plants essential oils from ten different geographical locations. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) and support vector regression (SVR) were used as machine learning methodologies. However, a deep learning based model called as one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) were also developed for models comparison. With a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.999 and a lowest RMSEP (root mean squared error of prediction) of 0.006% for the prediction datasets, the SVR model created for FT-IR spectral data outperformed both the PLSR and 1 D CNN models. On the other hand, for the classification of essential oils derived from plants collected from various geographical regions, the created SVM (support vector machine) classification model for Raman spectroscopic data obtained an overall classification accuracy of 0.997% which was superior than the FT-IR (0.986%) data. Based on the results we propose that FT-IR spectroscopy, when coupled with the SVR model, has a significant potential for the non-destructive identification of terpenoids in essential oils compared with destructive chemical analysis methods."

After COVID-19, people have no choice but to live their lives according to the “inevitable flow” called digital transformation. In this situation, there is a possibility that an attitude called “reluctant acceptability” rather than the framework of acceptance versus non-acceptance traditionally discussed may be manifested. Therefore, this study aims to analyze how reluctant acceptance is composed and what impact it has on future risk perception caused by digital transformation. The following figure illustrates the research model.For analysis, risk communication and psychometric paradigms were used as analysis tools. Each model has been validated as a useful tool for explaining public risk perception and has been confirmed to be effective in this study as well. Through the above analysis, the following implications were derived. First, we propose that it is necessary to pay attention to the concept of reluctant acceptability in the context of digital transformation. Such acceptability is likely to be manifested in various areas of our society in the future. Second, we found that reluctant acceptability is perceived as a risk by people, unlike general acceptability. This result shows that people’s acceptability attitude toward digital transformation is multidimensional. Thirdly, reluctant acceptability may act as a hindering factor for people to properly recognize the level of future risks associated with digital transformation. If the attitude of reluctant acceptability persists, there is a possibility that people will show optimistic bias toward potential risks. Lastly, we confirmed that the attitude of reluctant acceptability in the digital transformation era is not only determined by individual intrinsic characteristics, but also socially constructed. We expect that these results will provide a useful perspective for understanding reluctant acceptability in the digital transformation era."

Moreover, as the demand for public culture content of women's narratives increases, Seorae is a character that responds to a society. Seorae not only copes with patriarchal society and male power with the greatest ease but is also active in pioneering her own life and love. And because she moves with a definite plan, her independence is most emphasized. In an age where faith is absent, the love of modern people who gladly choose to ‘break up’ rather than connect with their loved one is tragic.

However, because ferrihydrite is a metastable mineral, there is a possibility of releasing adsorbed ions by phase transformation to other minerals having low surface area and high crystallinity. In this study, the adsorption characteristics of arsenate, chromate, and selenate on ferrihydrite and the oxyanion removal efficiency of ferrihydrite were studied considering mineral phase transformation. At both pH 4 and 8, the adsorption of oxyanions used in the study were in good agreement with both Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models except for selenate at pH 8. Due to the difference in surface charge according to pH, at pH 4 a higher amount of ions were adsorbed than at pH 8. The adsorption amount were in the order of arsenate, chromate, and selenate. These different adsorption models and adsorption amounts were due to different adsorption mechanisms for each oxyanions on the surface of ferrihydrite. These adsorption characteristics were closely related to changes in the mineral phase. At pH 4, a phase transformation to goethite or hematite was observed, but only a phase transformation to hematite was observed at pH 8. Among the oxyanion species on ferrihydrite, arsenate showed the highest adsorption capacity and hardly caused phase transformation during the experimental period after adsorption. Contrary to this, chromate and selenate showed faster mineral phase transformation than arsenate, and selenate had the lowest retardation effect among the three oxyanions. Ferrihydrite can effectively remove arsenate due to its high adsorption capacity and low phase transformation rate. However, the removal efficiency for other two oxyanions were low by the low adsorption amount and additional mineral phase transformation. For chromate, the efficient removal is expected only at low concentrations in low pH environments."
두 개의 인코더를 이용한 장면 텍스트 인식,2023,"['deep learning', 'scene text recognition', 'convolutional neural network', 'transformer']",,"Despite significant advancements in scene text recognition, current models face substantial challenges, particularly when confronted with irregular text images featuring complex backgrounds, curved text, diverse fonts, and distortions. While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based text recognition networks have demonstrated commendable performance, they grapple with the aforementioned challenges. Recently, transformer-based feature extractors have exhibited advantages in global feature extraction from images, especially in the context of irregular text images. By employing self-attention, these transformers establish information connections between different parts of the image, thereby mitigating the impact of uneven character distribution. This study proposes multi-encoder scene text recognition (MESTR), a hybrid approach that combines a CNN-based and a transformer-based feature extractor. MESTR excels in simultaneously extracting local and global features from text images, ensuring the integration of both types of features to enhance performance. During training, we employed a guiding connectionist temporal classification (CTC) decoder [6] as a compensatory training strategy for the attentional decoder. Our experiments showed the efficacy of MESTR across seven benchmarks, demonstrating robust performance. In addition, ablation experiments are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for scene text recognition."

When using the augmentation policy, the characteristics of the solar cell defect may disappear from the data, so filtering was performed with the model learned from the original data. For filtering, only images with a prediction probability of 70% or more of augmented images through the Soft-max function were used. When comparing the performance of the proposed methods and the method learned with the original data, it showed excellent performance. As a result, the proposed model showed a performance improvement of about 5% based on accuracy, and a recall value of about 93% was obtained."

SAM Optimizer를 통한 위내시경 이미지 분류 CADx의 성능 향상 연구,2023,"['CADx', 'Gastric Diagnosis', 'Classification', 'Convolution Neural Network', 'Deep learning', 'Vision Transformer']",,"Gastric cancer has a high incidence in East Asians, and the risk increases over time. Often, gastric cancer presents no early symptoms, leading to missed treatments. Consequently, in Korea, support is provided to individuals over 40 years of age who undergo gastroscopy. However, as the number of gastroscopy patients increases, doctors' fatigue rises, becoming a factor that can lead to misdiagnosis. Therefore, this paper proposes a CADx (Computer-Aided Diagnosis) system for gastric lesion classification based on ConvNeXt and ViT (Vision Transformer), applying the SAM (Sharpness Aware Minimization) optimizer. ConvNeXt is a network that achieves high performance by incorporating techniques from Swin Transformer and the latest advancements, with ResNet-50 as the base model. ViT divides the image into smaller patches and uses these patches as input to the Transformer. This allows for learning relationships between patches and ultimately leads to image classification. To address the issue of limited data in medical images, the gastric abnormal dataset was augmented using the AutoAugment policy. The SAM Optimizer is an optimization technique that detects and minimizes the ""sharpness"" of the loss function that may occur during the deep learning model's learning process. Using this method, the sensitivity of classifying abnormal and normal gastroscopy images in ConvNeXt increased from 0.7167 to 0.9583 for the original dataset and from 0.7583 to 0.9833 for the augmented dataset. ViT exhibited a significant decrease from 0.9500 to 0.7750 in the original dataset but increased from 0.9500 to 0.9583 in the augmented dataset. This demonstrates that the SAM Optimizer can effectively enhance CADx performance."

Brain Tumor Detection Based on Amended Convolution Neural Network Using MRI Images,2023,"['Brain tumor', 'CNN', 'Image tissue feature extraction', 'Medical science', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marr Wavelet Transformation', 'Sigmoid activation function']",,"Brain tumors are one of the most threatening malignancies for humans. Misdiagnosis of brain tumors can result in false medical intervention, which ultimately reduces a patient's chance of survival. Manual identification and segmentation of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans can be difficult and error-prone because of the great range of tumor tissues that exist in various individuals and the similarity of normal tissues. To overcome this limitation, the Amended Convolutional Neural Network (ACNN) model has been introduced, a unique combination of three techniques that have not been previously explored for brain tumor detection. The three techniques integrated into the ACNN model are image tissue pre-processing using the Kalman Bucy Smoothing Filter to remove noisy pixels from the input, image tissue segmentation using the Isotonic Regressive Image Tissue Segmentation Process, and feature extraction using the Marr Wavelet Transformation. The extracted features are compared with the testing features using a sigmoid activation function in the output layer. The experimental findings show that the suggested model outperforms existing techniques concerning accuracy, precision, sensitivity, dice score, Jaccard index, specificity, Positive Predictive Value, Hausdorff distance, recall, and F1 score. The proposed ACNN model achieved a maximum accuracy of 98.8%, which is higher than other existing models, according to the experimental results."

To obtain training data, different scenarios from an existing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model are simulated via transient analysis using Cradle scSTREAM. The raw dataset is transformed to having time step sizes of 2.5s, 5.0s, and 50.0s. Feature scaling is also employed on the each data set using both min-max scaling and z-score methods for a total of 9 datasets. Hyperparameters according to machine learning (ML) algorithms are varied such that 15 ML models across the four algorithms are developed. The results show that the regression trees perform the best over all other algorithms, with all models maintaining R2 values above 0.95 at the different datasets. On the other hand, as expected, all linear models demonstrated poor performance compared to nonlinear models. Data resolution affects model accuracy and training time, with accuracy declining slightly as time step size increased. It is also found that there is no significant effect of feature scaling. Lastly, ML models yield substantially cheaper simulation costs than CFD to simulate airflow."

The empirical analysis results indicate that the majority of students are highly satisfied with the flipped learning teaching model, which allows for personalized learning, autonomous learning, and collaborative learning, ultimately achieving good teaching results. However, when operating the flipped classroom, some students find the learning burden too heavy or face difficulties in self-management, affecting the completion of tasks during the class.

Transformed data were used as input for three RNN models: long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), which were compared to determine the optimal network for the classification of signals. Because the fractional Fourier transform displayed different characteristics depending on the chosen angle parameter, the optimal angle range for each RNN was first determined. To evaluate network performance, metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were employed. Numerical experiments demonstrated that all three networks performed well, however, the BiLSTM network outperformed LSTM and GRU in terms of learning results.

Based on automatic Chinese–English translation, this study examined the processing of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. First, this paper briefly introduces two basic translation models: seq2seq and Transformer. Second, we propose a semantic-based OOV processing method, which replaces OOV words with the most similar words by calculating the semantic similarity of word vectors and then uses the source-language sentences with the replaced words to train a translation model. Compared to the seq2seq model, the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) values of the Transformer model were higher (37.26 for the NIST06 dataset and 30.75 for the NIST08 dataset). After OOV processing, retaining low-frequency OOV words was conducive to the improvement of BLEU scores, which were increased by 0.63 and 0.09 for NIST06 and NIST08 for the Transformer model, respectively.

NVIDIA TensorRT의 양자화를 적용하여 딥러닝 모델을 최적화하였고 Deepstream을 활용하여 모든 카메라 영상에 대한 분석을 하나의 프로세스로 구성하여 하드웨어 자원 사용 효율성을 높였다. 주차장이나 차량에 센서를 설치해야 하는 일반적인 실내 측위 기술과 다르게 제안 방법은 추가적인 센서를 설치할 필요가 없어 경제적이며 주차장 도면만 있다면 정밀지도 제작 과정 없이 바로 적용할 수 있다는 장점이 있다. 딥러닝 모델 학습을 위해 실제 주차장에서 수집된 14000장의 이미지 데이터를 사용하였으며 120개의 실제 주차장 영상 데이터로 진행한 실험에서 98.1%의 객체 재인식 성능을 보였고 40m 거리에서 평균 3.65m 오차 범위의 위치 추정 정확도를 보였다.","This paper introduce an effective method for indoor localization in an indoor parking lot and monitoring in real time by analyzing surveillance camera images installed in a parking lot. Proposed method analyzes the camera image installed in the parking lot using a deep learning to express the location of the vehicle as integrated grid map coordinate, which can express the location of all vehicles in the parking lot in real time. The method consists of three deep learning models: object detection, tracking and license plate recognition and coordinate transformation algorithms. The deep learning model was optimized by applying quantization of NVIDIA TensorRT, and all camera video input was organized into one process using Deepstream to increase the efficiency of hardware resource usage. Unlike conventional indoor positioning technologies that require sensors to be installed in parking lots or vehicles, the proposed method is economical because it does not need additional sensors. 14,000 image collected from parking lots were used for deep learning model learning. The experiment conducted with 120 images showed 98.1% Re-ID performance and the location estimation error was 3.65m on average at a distance of 40m."
A Grounded Theoretical Approach to the Healing Travel Experience as a Short-term Mission Strategy in a Creative Access Areas,2023,"['Mobility Turn', 'Travel Geography', 'Healing Travel', 'Short-term Missions in Creative Acess Areas', 'Grounded Theory', 'Short-term Mission Alternatives']",,"The mobility turn is presenting an alternative by presenting various spaces beyond the binary opposition between existing spaces and places. Mobility travel allows travelers to pursue a healing travel by personalizing and desiring space in a non-place space(a place that was not a place), which is a space of flow. The purpose of this study is to analyze the meaning of the healing travel experience through pilgrimage to sacred places as a unified mission model with both sending and going missionaries, from a travel geographical perspective, as a short-term mission strategy in creative access areas.The analysis was conducted using Strauss and Corbin's grounded theory methodology, involving three stages: open coding, axial coding, and selective coding. In the open coding stage, 143 concepts and 31 subcategories were derived. These subcategories were further consolidated into 15 overarching categories. In the axial coding stage, focal phenomena emerged, titled "" new short-term mission strategy for creative access areas and healing travel experiences."" Causal conditions, contextual conditions, intervening conditions, and strategies of action/interaction were identified and applied to a paradigm model. In the selective coding stage, the core category of ""sharing healing travel experiences"" was identified as a unifying missionary model for creative approaches to short-term missions in creative access areas. The narrative structure was constructed around the core category of sharing healing travel experiences, revealing a situational model that presented pilgrimage healing travel as a short-term mission strategy for creative access areas. Travelers sought to personalize and transform the non-place spaces of sacred sites by invoking past events from the Bible, actualizing the sacredness in the present. This personalization of place, achieved through the contemporization of sacredness, facilitated a healing travel experience, offering healing, recovery, satisfaction, and fulfillment to both the sending and going missionaries. It illuminated a new resilience and presented a fresh alternative for short-term mission endeavors. This study is noteworthy for exploring specific instances that transcend the binary framework of space and place, delving into the process of placemaking of space as a non-place, adapted for the era of mobility. Additionally, the significance is further realized in the context of understanding that the missionary life required by the Bible is inherently tied to the concept of the placemaking of space."

It is important for schools to become agents of transformation and for school members to build capacity for transformation. However, it is not easy for education toward transformation and sustainability to be mainstreamed in schools. This study conducted a case study of A Middle School, which has been engaged in meaningful educational practices through a whole school approach. ENSI’s Quality Criteria for Education for Sustaianable Development schools and the whole school approach pentagon (WSAP) model as a framework to describe the constituent areas of the whole school approach. The analysis and description included a review of the school education plans and related literatures, and interviews with a teacher from Middle School A and a representative from the neighboring B village. First, at the level of school operations and decision-making, there is governance, with teachers and social cooperatives at the center. Village and democracy are also two pillars of the curriculum. Starting with the “Village is the School” curriculum in the early days of the Innovation School, “Community Living Agreement”, “Ecology and Energy”, and “Cooperatives” became the main curriculum topics. In recent years, the curriculum has also included the Sunlight School Project, ecological transformation education, and climate and energy conergence curriculum, which are often loosely integrated with other subjects and carried out in collaboration with the village. Many diverse and innovative pedagogies are found in the teaching and learning process, and students’ real lives, schools, and villages are often used as contexts. The management and operation of school facilities are centered around the zero-energy house and solar power plant. Students, teachers, and villagers are involved in the creation and operation of these facilities, and they are based on community partnerships. At the center of all of these activities are various “curricula”, which are based on the social learning of school members and villages. Village and democracy are key themes, and are based on a working partnership between school and village. The whole school approach to sustainable society in this school corresponds to the highest stage of the developmental stages proposed in the previous research namely stage 4, the transformational stage. It can be said that the school is creating a transformation of schooling and a transformation of the community through a whole school approach, which provides meaningful implications for many schools attempting to implement a whole school approach to sustainability."
Puerarin alleviates chronic renal failure-induced pyroptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells by targeting miR-342-3p/TGF-β/SMAD axis,2023,['Chronic renal failure (CRF) · Puerarin · miR-342-3p · TGF-β/SMAD axis'],,"Background Chronic renal failure (CRF) is the result of kidney damage. Puerarin is a flavonoid with specific nephroprotective effect, but its effect on CRF needs further research. This study explored the effect of puerarin on CRF and the potential molecular mechanism.Methods Adenine was used to establish an in vivo CRF model in rats, and rats were intragastrically administered with puerarin at a dose of 400 mg/kg body weight once a day from day 1 to day 28. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Masson staining were used to observe the morphology and fibrosis of kidney tissue. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (400 ng/mL)/H2O2 (200 µM) was applied to human kidney 2 (HK-2) cells to construct an in vitro CRF model. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to validate interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 levels. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to detect microRNA (miR)-342-3p levels. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)1, SMAD2, SMAD3, and pyroptosis marker proteins were detected by Western blot. The interaction between miR-342-3p and TGF-β/SMAD was determined by a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was utilized to determine cell viability.Results In the CRF model, puerarin alleviated renal injury and fibrosis and reduced creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. At the same time, miR-342-3p was downregulated, while the TGF-β/SMAD axis was activated and levels of IL-1β and IL-18 were increased. After treatment of CRF rats with puerarin, the expression level of miR-342-3p was increased, the TGF-β/SMAD axis was inhibited, and the secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 was decreased. MiR-342-3p directly bound to and negatively regulated the expression of TGF-β1, SMAD2, and SMAD3. In the in vitro CRF model, miR-342-3p inhibited HK-2 cell pyroptosis by inhibiting the TGF-β/SMAD axis.Conclusion Puerarin reduced renal injury and pyroptosis in CRF rats by targeting the miR-342-3p/TGF-β/SMAD axis."

Analysis and Improvement of the Effect of Listening Anxiety on  College English Teaching Based on Neural Network,2023,"['Neural Network', 'Recognition Efficiency', 'Semantic English', 'Feature Extraction', 'Anxiety Classification.']",,"Listening is an important form of language input, especially for students. Language learning should be mainly based on auditory input, so listening plays a very important role in the process of language learning. Listening is one of the language skills most likely to cause anxiety in foreign language learners. In order to better analyze the impact of listening anxiety on the effect of college English teaching, we propose an analysis and improvement method based on a neural network model. The goal of this paper is to utilize a neural network model for analyzing the various factors that influence psychological anxiety of college students and to formulate targeted and directional countermeasures for the causes of this problem. We propose a neural network-based model for the English listening anxiety classification and recognition.Based on this method, we expect to effectively reduce the anxiety of college students in college English listening learning, so as to improve the quality of English listening teaching. Specifically, firstly, we design a questionnaire to collect data on students, such as anxiety level, reasons, difficulty of listening materials, classroom atmosphere, emotion. Secondly, we utilize the text material obtained from the questionnaire as training data for the model, and we design a text processing and transformation method. Thirdly, we design a feature extraction and anxiety classification method using a neural network model. Finally, through experiments with students in different classes, we have confirmed that the method proposed in this paper demonstrates excellent performance in classifying and recognizing English anxiety."

In particular, the demand for analyzing texts in specialized domains is rapidly increasing. Therefore, studies are being conducted to analyze specialized and general- purpose documents simultaneously. To analyze specific terms with general terms, it is necessary to align the embedding space of the specific terms with the embedding space of the general terms. So far, attempts have been made to align the embedding of specific terms into the embedding space of general terms through a transformation matrix or mapping function. However, the linear transformation based on the transformation matrix showed a limitation in that it only works well in a local range.To overcome this limitation, various types of nonlinear vector alignment methods have been recently proposed. We propose a vector alignment model that matches the embedding space of specific terms to the embedding space of general terms through end-to-end learning that simultaneously learns the autoencoder and regression model. As a result of experiments with R&D documents in the “Healthcare” field, we confirmed the proposed methodology showed superior performance in terms of accuracy compared to the traditional model."
RelCurator: a text mining-based curation system for extracting gene–phenotype relationships specific to neurodegenerative disorders,2023,['Curation system · Deep learning · Gene–phenotype relationship · Neurodegenerative disorders'],,"Background The identification of gene–phenotype relationships is important in medical genetics as it serves as a basis for precision medicine. However, most of the gene-phenotype relationship data are buried in the biomedical literature in textual form.Objective We propose RelCurator, a curation system that extracts sentences including both gene and phenotype entities related to specific disease categories from PubMed articles, provides rich additional information such as entity taggings, and predictions of gene–phenotype relationships.Methods We targeted neurodegenerative disorders and developed a deep learning model using Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) networks and BioWordVec word embeddings for predicting gene–phenotype relationships from biomedical texts. The prediction model is trained with more than 130,000 labeled PubMed sentences including gene and phenotype entities, which are related to or unrelated to neurodegenerative disorders.Results We compared the performance of our deep learning model with those of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and simple Recurrent Neural Network (simple RNN) models. Our model performed better with an F1-score of 0.96. Furthermore, the evaluation done using a few curation cases in the real scenario showed the effectiveness of our work. Therefore, we conclude that RelCurator can identify not only new causative genes, but also new genes associated with neurodegenerative disorders’ phenotype.Conclusion RelCurator is a user-friendly method for accessing deep learning-based supporting information and a concise web interface to assist curators while browsing the PubMed articles. Our curation process represents an important and broadly applicable improvement to the state of the art for the curation of gene–phenotype relationships."

It’s through “A Haenyeo Story” performed by Haenyeo’s Kitchen. In a format more akin to a variety show, the disparate elements of what to see, hear, and eat in “A Haenyeo Story” forms an assemblage rather than a cohesive narrative. This assemblage comes with tensions and contradictions.The various agents assembled in the contact zone of Haenyeo’s Kitchen circulate material and affective ideas and meanings. Affects also circulate ideas and meanings of the agents. Affects transform the visitor from an observer to a participant, from a participant to a patron. This transformation of the visitor is driven by the service economy model. But another agent, the Haenyeo, remains enslaved during the visitor’s transformation. The ecosystem of the service economy biopolitically embraces the livelihood of Haenyeo on the premise of the division and hierarchy of “Haenyeo’s Kitchen” and “World’s Table.” The service economy model ultimately positions the livelihood of the Haenyeo as a resource to support the livelihood of the universal population, represented by the “World’s table”. However, the Haenyeo does not stay in the place assigned to her by the biopolitical hierarchy. Haenyeo is the embodiment of disaffection, transforming the banal domesticity of the domestic labor model into a vibrant domesticity, and from there she continues to move and move on. Haenyeo’s disaffection for individual survival and community prosperity is a way of “becoming Haenyeo” that breaks the stereotype of “Haenyeo-hood” by rejecting the strictness and banality of the identity of a Haenyeo. In this respect, it is worth reflecting that the “A Haenyeo Story” is not leading to the discovery of the authenticity of “Haenyeo-hood”, but rather arranging an uncomfortable encounter with the inauthenticity of “becoming Haenyeo”, through disaffection."

Reflecting this trend, in 2020, the SEMA Nam-Seoul Museum of Art planned an exhibition, entitled “Never Ever Artistic, Sloppy Museum,” to bolster the active participation of art fans in the non-face-to-face era. The author was invited as an exhibition artist and presented an art prototype project, “Tea Room:2020,” at the exhibition. The purpose of this study is to envision a ‘superposition model of art creation-enjoyment’ in the non-face-to-face period, the experiment “Tea Room:2020” based on the model, and to discuss its meaning. In this way, the study seeks new relationships, the communication and union of creation and appreciation, and examines the significance of these concepts. To this end, the author proposed ‘Yemundap’, a circular, iterative, and discontinuous communication method into which a tea ceremony and Zen riddles were transformed. ‘Yemundap’ also combines drawing and augmented reality to superpose art creation and enjoyment. To realize this, heuristics were applied when implementing “Tea Room:2020.” In this work, the creator and art fans share artistic dialogues while communicating by drawing messages that are contained in paper cups and combined with augmented reality. Here, the roles of the creator and the art fan are overlapped and reversed, and they create a collaborative creation. This project has emotional significance in that the art fans immerse themselves in the creation and exploration of works by a waiting period created by the discontinuous communication of ‘Yemundap’, experiencing the sense of normalcy that existed before the COVID19 pandemic. Nonetheless, in order to generalize the superposition model of ‘Yemundap’, it is necessary to improve its complex process and to reduce its excessive performative methods."

However, one of the crucial prerequisites for a successful transition is the digital proficiency of its members. Students studying Management of Technology without a prior background in engineering face the difficult challenge of improving both their business management skills and digital competency within a limited time frame. For this reason, effective IT competency education methods are emerging as one of the educational issues in technology management. This paper showcases the IT-focused curriculum revision process of Sogang University's Graduate School of Management of Technology, along with the outcomes of its implementation thus far, as a demonstration of addressing the questions of ""what to teach"" and ""how to teach"" for students who could potentially become leaders in guiding the digital transformation. The purpose of this paper, specifically, is to offer a prior reference for the operation direction of effective programming education for students in Management of Technology graduate schools through a discussion on the feedback results of the required fundamental programming course which acts as both the starting point and entry hurdle."

In particular, the introduction of digital new technologies such as AI, big data, and cloud technology is increasing to implement innovative business models through digital transformation. In addition, as the geopolitical environment around the world is rapidly changing in recent years, the importance of establishing an economic security strategy for Korea is also increasing. However, the domestic security management plan for the source code, which is the core technical information of digital innovation, is insufficient.Security incidents have increased due to poor management of internal employees due to the new environment, increased attack surfaces due to the use of various IT systems, and sophisticated and advanced risks, and software source code, which are corporate trade secrets, have recently been leaked frequently. In particular, in Korea, this risk is becoming a reality, such as a large-scale leak of important source code by a hacking organization in a company recently. Although the leakage of source code is viewed more generously than the leakage of personal information, the impact on third parties is increasing as the supply chain is expanding due to globalization. Therefore, in this paper, we examine the economic importance of source code in the era of digital innovation, review the current status of management legal and policy systems to prevent leakage of source code at domestic and abroad, and analyze the problems of the current domestic legal and policy system for source code security management. Through this, we intend to propose a source code security management method suitable for the domestic industrial security environment."

In this study, we analyzed efficiency changes in the life insurance industry from 2016 to 2021 using Malmquist Global Productivity Index. The results showed a decrease in efficiency due to external factors in 2018, whereas COVID-19 had little impact on life insurance companies. Furthermore, the efficiency of life insurance companies for each year was statically analyzed using the DEA-CCR, DEA-BCC, and DEA-SBM models, and relative efficiency rankings were derived using the super-efficiency. The outcome indicated that Samsung Life Insurance was the most efficient among the Big-3(Samsung, Hanhwa, Kyobo) companies in Korea. Kyobo Life Planet, an insurance company specialized in Internet, showed very high efficiency, but BNP Paribas Cardif Life Insurance, which uses a B2B2C sales method, represented lower efficiency than other companies.

In contrast to existing services that offer limited choices for story reconstruction, our proposed service allows the user to engage in interactive dialogue with a conversational AI using a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model. After reading the fairy tale, the user responds to a series of questions generated by ChatGPT based on the story and user input. Upon completing the conversation, the generated fairy tale text, along with keyword-based automatically recommended image elements, help the user to draw accompanying illustrations. The combined text and drawings can be saved for future reference. QuickDraw dataset, a large-scale collection of sketches created by human users, is employed to suggest drawings relevant to story keywords. The implementation results demonstrate the good performance of the conversational AI in story question generation, while the provision of sketch samples contributes to user engagement.

Computer-aided diagnosis system based on multi-scale feature fusion for screening large-scale gastrointestinal diseases,2023,"['computer-aided diagnosis', 'deep learning', 'transformer', 'convolutional neural network', 'gastrointestinal diseases']",,"For endoscopists, large-scale screening of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases is arduous and time-consuming. While their workload and human factor-induced errors can be reduced by computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems, the existing ones mainly focus on a limited number of lesions or specific organs, making them unsuitable for diagnosing various GI diseases in large-scale disease screening. This paper proposes a transformer and convolutional neural network-based CAD system (called TransMSF) to assist endoscopists in diagnosing multiple GI diseases. This system constructs two feature extraction paths with different coding methods to obtain the lesions’ global and local information. In addition, downsampling is implemented in transformer to get global information of different scales, further enriching the feature representation and reducing the amount of computation and memory occupation. Moreover, a channel and spatial attention module with fewer parameters was successfully designed to pay more attention to the target and reduce the loss of important information during spatial dimension transformation. Finally, the extracted feature information is fused through the feature fusion module and then input into the linear classifier for disease diagnosis. The proposed system outperformed that of other state-of-the-art models on two datasets, reaching a 98.41% precision, a 98.15% recall, a 98.13% accuracy, and a 98.28% F1 score on the in-house GI dataset versus a 95.88% precision, a 95.88% recall, a 98.97% accuracy, and a 95.88% F1 score on the public Kvasir dataset. Moreover, TransMSF’s performance was superior to that of seasoned endoscopists. The above results prove that the proposed system is instrumental in diagnosing GI diseases in large-scale disease screening. It can also be used as a training tool for junior endoscopists to improve their professional skills by rendering helpful suggestions."

To achieve this objective, we employed a dual sampling approach, utilizing both snowball sampling and purposive sampling, to gather a cohort of men who had experienced infertility for more than two years. In-depth interviews were subsequently conducted with a diverse group of eight participants ranging in age from 20 years to 50 years. Qualitative data from these in-depth interviews were meticulously transcribed and subjected to analysis employing the grounded theory methodology. Through an open coding process, a total of 120 concepts, 26 subcategories, and 11 overarching categories emerged. Additionally, utilizing axial coding, we identified 'Experience and perception of infertility' as a causal condition, 'Infertility trauma' and 'Cognitive misconceptions about pregnancy and childbirth' as contextual conditions, and 'Psychological distress' as the phenomenon under scrutiny. Furthermore, the intervention conditions were found to be 'Changes in the support system' and 'Changes in the perception of wives,' along with 'Self-reflection' and 'Acquisition of knowledge about pregnancy and childbirth' as the interactive factors. The resultant outcome encompassed 'Efforts to address infertility' and 'Alterations in marital relationships.' Through the selective coding process, we uncovered the core category of 'Cognitive and emotional transformation.' Building upon this, we classified various male infertility experiences into the following four distinct types: 'Communication type', 'Conflict type', 'Wait and see type' and 'Self-reflection type'. Based on these findings, we engaged in a comprehensive discussion regarding the significance and limitations of this study, and offered suggestions for prospective research endeavors."
Digital Orientation for Emerging Multinationals and the Location Strategies in Internationalization: The Chinese Experience,2023,"['Digital Orientation', 'Internationalization', 'Location Choice', 'Innovation', 'China']",,"Purpose- Despite the ongoing digital transformation, it is not clear whether emerging market firms follow their manufacturing FDI path in the emerging digital industries. This paper examines how digital orientation affects the location strategies in internationalization and how the existing innovation capacities moderate the link between digital orientation and the location strategies.Design/methodology/approach- This study chooses the Chinese setting for research design because digital transformation is already prevalent in the society and the cases of outward expansion are salient among the emerging markets. It uses the panel dataset of 976 Chinese listed firms that consists of 6,648 observations spanning from 2007 to 2017. Ordinary least square regression is used for the statistical approach with a one-year lag in the model.Findings- Digital orientation increases a likelihood of emerging multinationals’ entries in developed countries, and a high level of innovative capacities strengthens the link. Two groups seem to prefer entries in developed countries: firms with a high level of digital orientation with a high level of innovative capacities and firms with a low level of digital orientation, if with a low level of innovative capacities. The former reflects the context of digital transformation and the latter hints at the tax avoidance or interests in real estate.Research implications or originality -While emerging multinationals are known to prefer entries in developing countries for capacity arbitrage, our results forecast that their FDI strategies may have a drastic change as digital transformation deepens."
Performance of deep learning approaches for detection and classification of ceramic tile defects,2023,"['Deep learning', 'Classification', 'Ceramic tile images', 'VGG model', 'CNN.']",,"Ceramic tiles are in high demand in the infrastructure and building development industries due to their low cost, ease ofinstallation, maintenance, moisture resistance, and availability in a broad range of colors, textures, and sizes. Automatedfacilities, which produce hundreds of tiles in every segment, require a tremendous volume of output. Because of the largenumber of tiles produced and the frequency with which they are produced, it is impossible to manually examine them forfaults, necessitating the use of a rapid, efficient, and reliable automated process. However, while the process of detecting flawsand categorizing them (or classification) is not as efficient as it might be, recent advances in computing technology,mathematical modeling, and high-resolution picture capture equipment have given rise to new prospects in the subject. Manykinds of literature on using these systems for the same goal are currently accessible. Deep learning is a type of artificialintelligence that helps people makes decisions. In production applications, image detection of faulty Ceramic Tile Surfaces isa critical skill. Deep learning is now being studied for its potential application in automated defect identification.

In contrast, the proposed approach estimates transformation functions for image enhancement using a network trained on a large dataset, allowing adaptation to diverse low-light input images and providing a rationale for the outcomes obtained from transformation functions. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed technique, key metrics for assessing image quality, namely PSNR and SSIM, were employed.

An Attention-based Temporal Network for Parkinson's Disease Severity Rating using Gait Signals,2023,"[""Parkinson's disease"", 'Gait signals', 'Severity rating', 'Vertical ground reaction force', 'Transformer network']",,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a typical, chronic neurodegenerative disease involving the concentration of dopamine, which can disrupt motor activity and cause different degrees of gait disturbance relevant to PD severity in patients. As current clinical PD diagnosis is a complex, time-consuming, and challenging task that relays on physicians' subjective evaluation of visual observations, gait disturbance has been extensively explored to make automatic detection of PD diagnosis and severity rating and provides auxiliary information for physicians' decisions using gait data from various acquisition devices. Among them, wearable sensors have the advantage of flexibility since they do not limit the wearers' activity sphere in this application scenario. In this paper, an attention-based temporal network (ATN) is designed for the time series structure of gait data (vertical ground reaction force signals) from foot sensor systems, to learn the discriminative differences related to PD severity levels hidden in sequential data. The structure of the proposed method is illuminated by Transformer Network for its success in excavating temporal information, containing three modules: a preprocessing module to map intra-moment features, a feature extractor computing complicated gait characteristic of the whole signal sequence in the temporal dimension, and a classifier for the final decision-making about PD severity assessment. The experiment is conducted on the public dataset PDgait of VGRF signals to verify the proposed model's validity and show promising classification performance compared with several existing methods."
Internal State Estimation Method of Film Capacitors used in Three-Phase DC to AC Converters and Comparisons with Electrolytic Capacitors,2023,"['Film Capacitor Condition', 'Health Monitoring', 'Film Capacitor', 'Artificial Learning']",,"Metalized polymer-film capacitors have acquired a distinctive position among a variety of capacitor types due to their self-healing ability. Therefore, these devices are appropriate for critical power applications that demand reliability and durability. Nevertheless, as converters are increasingly being used for transmissions in networks, it is essential to improve stability to ensure the safety of system operations. Therefore, it is necessary to have a monitoring process that enables predictive maintenance to evaluate the health status and ensure the stability of electrical systems. However, the research in this field concentrates on electrolytic capacitors; and the characteristics of electrolytic and film capacitors differ. Hence, the need for further investigation into film capacitors is evident. This research proposes a condition monitoring approach that employs frequency signal analysis to assess the health status of capacitors in a three-phase AC-DC converter. The capacitor current is subjected to discrete wavelet transform and normalized by various indices, which serve as the input for learning algorithms. In addition, for comparison, capacitor voltage, output current, and output voltage are investigated using the discrete wavelet transform and fast Fourier transform. In this study, various indexes including root-mean-squared value, variance, average, and median, are utilized as inputs for artificial intelligent models to investigate factors affecting film capacitors. Eight learning algorithms are implemented to monitor the health status of film capacitors. The results show that utilizing the discrete wavelet transform combined with indexes for capacitor current yields a high accuracy of approximately 99.85%. These findings offer valuable insights into monitoring film capacitors using advanced techniques, and are anticipated to be informative for practical applications of film capacitor monitoring."

Adaptive robust control of active magnetic bearings rigid rotor systems,2023,"['Active magnetic bearing (AMB)', 'H-infi nite robust control (HRC)', 'Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II)', 'Active disturbance rejection control (ADRC)']",,"Aiming at the problems of diffi cult decoupling, complex controller models, and poor disturbance rejection capability caused by the inherent nonlinear and strong coupling characteristics of the active magnetic bearing (AMB), an adaptive H-infinity robust control (AHRC) method is proposed in the AMBs-rigid rotor system. The proposed method combines the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) with the robust control to achieve stable operation of the AMBs-rigid rotor system under high-speed conditions. First, a four-degree-of-freedom (4-DOF) AMBs-rigid rotor model was established and transformed into a one-degree-of-freedom (1-DOF) model for the design of the robust controller, which weakens the coupling effect between each of the degrees of freedom (DOF). Then the multi-objective non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) was used to fi nd the relative optimal weighting function value of the H-infinite robust control (HRC), which solved the difficulties in the design of the robust controller for known controlled system models. In addition, by combining the optimized H-infi nity robust controller with the original error feedback control rate in the ADRC, the proposed AHRC retains the strong robustness of the HRC and the decoupling capability of the ADRC, which improves the tracking performance and anti-disturbance performance of the controlled system. Simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method."
Study on handwritten invoice recognition system,2023,"['Handwritten', 'Optical character recognition', 'Visual document understanding', 'Neural Network', 'Transformer']",,"In recent years, the growing preference for contactless services has resulted in an increased demand for kiosk-based reception systems. Although several kiosks have been activated for product orders, the reception services that entail more intricate procedures and require extensive information, such as those in postal and logistics services, have not been adequately embraced. Furthermore, the conventional paper-based reception systems fail to suffice the modern requirements. Therefore, this study proposes an innovative system for automatically processing handwritten invoices. The proposed system accurately extracts invoice details from parcel images and automatically digitizes the sender and receiver information by employing a visual document understanding model.

For this reason, there has been a consistent stream of studies analyzing the stereotypical portrayal of animated characters from a feminist perspective. This study analyzed <Toy Story>, a work that was first released in 1995 and released until 4 installments in 2019, based on gender stereotypes and feminist identity models.<Toy Story> is a work that is recognized for both its artistic quality and popularity, and you can see the character's change over the course of 25 years under one worldview. Also, due to the setting of the world of toys, it is a work that can confirm the multilayered nature of gender roles within one work. The female characters in the series, from Jessie to Barbie to Bo, demonstrate the transformation of female characters. They evolve from passive characters waiting for assistance from male characters despite appearing active on the surface, to more independent and proactive individuals while still outwardly presenting as typical females. Furthermore, there is a noticeable difference in gender representation between how people perceive and impose gender stereotypes on the characters during playtime and how the characters genuinely express themselves. In the first and second installments, there was a significant difference between a woman who was passive and waiting for help and a woman who was active in expressing her emotions. In the fourth installment, this gap appeared to narrow as the characters' true selves aligned more closely with how people interacted with them during play. In the play process of <Toy Story>, there are appropriate gender roles for men and women, and gender stereotypes that force people to perform appropriate social roles are clearly revealed. It can be seen that the expansion of the series from Part 1 to Part 4 well reflects the feminist identity model theory, in which women realize such reality and redefine their own identity in a male-centered culture."

Therefore, this study aims to analyze the impact and influence paths of user interaction within the sharing economy platform system on value co-creation.Based on the service-dominant logic theory, this study has formed a structural equation model by utilizing the user interaction, user relationships, users' psychological ownership, and co-creation value behavior. As a result of the analysis, user interaction within sharing economy platforms were found to have positive effect on the value co-creation behavior. In addition, user interaction had indirect influence on user relationship and value co-creation behavior through the mediation of users' psychological ownership. It gives some practical implication that cultivating an environment conducive to interaction within the sharing economy ecosystem can provide strategic value to platform operations."

Invariant graph and random bony attractors,2023,"['Skew products', 'maximal attractor', 'invariant graph', 'bony attractor']",,"In this paper, we deal with random attractors for dynamical systems forced by a deterministic noise. These kind of systems are modeled as skew products where the dynamics of the forcing process are described by the base transformation. Here, we consider skew products over the Bernoulli shift with the unit interval fiber. We study the geometric structure of maximal attractors, the orbit stability and stability of mixing of these skew products under random perturbations of the fiber maps. We show that there exists an open set $\mathcal{U}$ in the space of such skew products so that any skew product belonging to this set admits an attractor which is either a continuous invariant graph or a bony graph attractor. These skew products have negative fiber Lyapunov exponents and their fiber maps are non-uniformly contracting, hence the non-uniform contraction rates are measured by Lyapnnov exponents. Furthermore, each skew product of $\mathcal{U}$ admits an invariant ergodic measure whose support is contained in that attractor. Additionally, we show that the invariant measure for the perturbed system is continuous in the Hutchinson metric."
Image Classification Algorithm Based on Proposal Region Clustering Learning-Unsupervised Deep Learning,2023,"['Proposal cluster learning', 'Unsupervised learning', 'Multiple instance learning', 'Deep learning', 'Image classification']",,"Although deep learning has achieved certain results in image classification, images are susceptible to factors such as lighting conditions, shooting angles, complex backgrounds, rotation transformations or scale scaling, and image data sets in some areas are difficult to obtain. They make the deep learning framework unable to give full play to its generalization ability and nonlinear modeling ability in image classification. Therefore, this paper first proposes a proposal region clustering learning algorithm, which clusters the proposal regions in each image so that each cluster corresponds to the category of the image. Then, different clusters can be regarded as different multi-instance learning packets, and each packet uses the multi-instance learning method to learn the unsupervised image classification detector. It can effectively improve the generalization and modeling capabilities of deep learning models. In addition, this paper proposes an unsupervised deep learning method, which designs an unsupervised deep learning network structure and loss function according to the characteristics of the classified image, and combines densely connected blocks to extract features from the source image. It retains the multi-scale features of the middle layer of the classified image, and effectively solves the problem of insufficient image feature extraction information caused by the lack of image data. It also guarantees the accuracy of subsequent image classification. The experimental results show that the image classification method proposed in this paper not only solves the problem of insufficient image data sets and the interference of various complex factors, but also can accurately classify various image data sets. The accuracy of the image classification method proposed in this paper is 1.38–19% higher than other mainstream deep learning methods."
A Supervised Framework for Sentiment Analysis: A Two-Stage Approach,2023,"['natural language', 'neural network', 'sentiment analysis', 'text embedding']",,"Sentiment analysis (SA) is a vital part of natural language processing (NLP). It involves analyzing textual data to determine expressed sentiment, be it positive or negative. Transformer-based models have gained popularity for sentiment prediction from the text. However, achieving promising results with these models requires extensive training data and processing power. Additionally, when using pre-trained transformer models for sentiment analysis, they do not generate sentiment-specific text embeddings as they are trained on large general-purpose corpora. To address these challenges, this paper presents a two-step framework. Firstly, the framework aims to learn high-level sentiment-oriented embeddings of text. It generates embeddings with Siamese Network and compares them based on their sentiment class using the triplet loss function. This approach enables the framework to capture distinctions between positive and negative sentences, ensuring the generation of sentiment-specific embeddings. Secondly, it incorporates a classification layer on top of the embedding layer to enhance sentiment classification. Experimental results showcase the effectiveness of our proposed framework, surpassing baseline sentiment analysis results on various benchmark datasets."

These methods often faced challenges with reproducibility, leading to difficulties in accurately assessing a patient’s occlusion. This paper aims to present a technique for precise evaluation of the mandible position and the patient’s occlusion, achieved through the utilization of virtual articulators and virtual MPI (Mandibular Position Indicator), leveraging digital data to overcome these constraints. The use of virtual articulators allows for a convenient and accurate simulation in the program, entirely circumventing the need for intricate laboratory procedures. By leveraging digital data to create a virtual articulator and accurately evaluate a patient’s occlusion, it becomes feasible to formulate a treatment plan based on this evaluation, resulting in successful or-thodontic treatment. Digital transformation refers to the process of upgrading, enhancing, or replacing existing processes or systems with newer ones, facilitated by advancements in digital technology. The most crucial principle in the process of digital transformation is that it should be simpler and more accurate than the traditional analog methods. In the process of digitally transforming the occlusal evaluation, it is essential to first understand the principles of the procedures performed with the conventional analog articulators and then integrate them into the digital transformation. Therefore, this article aims to introduce how virtual articulators and virtual mandibular position indicators are utilized."

This study aimed to evaluate the potential anti-fibrotic effect of the combination of Rhei Radix et Rhizoma water extract (RW) and silymarin in a thioacetamide (TAA)-induced liver fibrosis model. Methods: The liver fibrosis mouse model was established through the intraperitoneal injection of TAA (1 week 100 mg/kg, 2-3 weeks 200 mg/kg, 4-8 weeks 400 mg/kg) three times per week for eight weeks. Animal experiments were conducted in five groups; Normal, Control (TAA-induced liver fibrosis mice), Sily (silymarin 50 mg/kg), RSL (RW 50 mg/kg+silymarin 50 mg/kg), and RSH (RW 100 mg/kg+silymarin 50 mg/kg). Biochemical analyses were measured in serum, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), malondialdehyde (MDA), and ammonia levels. Liver inflammatory cytokines and fibrous biomarkers were measured by Western blot analysis, and liver histopathology was evaluated through tissue staining. Results: A significant decrease in the liver function markers AST and ALT and a reduction in ammonia and total bilirubin were observed in the group treated with RSL and RSH. Measurement of reactive oxygen species and MDA revealed a significant decrease in the RSL and RSH administration group compared to the TAA induction group. The expression of extracellular matrix-related proteins, such as transforming growth factor β1, α-smooth muscle actin, and collagen type I alpha 1, was likewise significantly decreased. All drug-administered groups had increased matrix metalloproteinase-9 but a decreasing tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1. RSL and RSH exerted a significant upregulation of NADPH oxidase 2, p22<sup>phox</sup>, and p47<sup>phox</sup>, which are oxidative stress-related factors. Furthermore, pro-inflammatory proteins such as cyclooxygenase 2 and interleukin-1β were markedly suppressed through the inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B activation. Conclusions: The administration of RW and silymarin suppressed the NADPH oxidase factor protein level and showed a tendency to reduce inflammation-related enzymes. These results suggest that the combined administration of RW and silymarin improves acute liver injury induced by TAA."

The  term 'naturalistic  approach'  refers  to  the  theory  proposed  by  religious  scholar  Ann Taves  in  her  book  ‘Religious  Experience  Reconsidered’,  and  the  approach adopted by Olav Hammer, who utilized it as a religious entrepreneurial model.This  approach  extends  beyond  the  confines  of  William  James's  approach  to religious  experience.  By  examining  Daehaeng's  understanding  of  religious experience and the socialization process that facilitated its growth, the goal is to broaden the scope of understanding religious experiences, connecting them with other interdisciplinary perspectives, rather than limiting them solely to religious studies.  Although  Hanmaum-Seonwon  currently  identifies  with  Buddhism,  it  is also  a  new  religion  distinct  from  traditional  Buddhism,  making  it  a  subject worthy of study within the field of religious studies.In  this  article,  I  first  investigate  Daehaeng's  childhood  environment  and  the pivotal transformative factors in her life, particularly her 'Inner Dad' experience, which  played  a  crucial  role  in  her  personal  transformation.  Second,  I  explore her relationship with Buddhism and her period of practice as an agent. Third, I analyze  the  resonance  of  Daehaeng's  mystical  religious  experiences  and  her interactions  with  the  public,  which  strengthened  the  significance  of  her socialization  process.  Finally,  I  identify  Daehaeng's  religious  entrepreneurial success in her bold and exploratory spirit, unafraid to try new approaches even after establishing her presence in her homeland. Overall, it becomes evident that Daehaeng's  life-changing  trigger,  the  'inner  father'  experience,  combined  with her  Buddhist  background,  has  contributed  to  her  unique  perspectives  and practices.  Additionally,  her  effective  socialization  strategy,  engaging  with  the public, and her creative and adventurous spirit in exploring new paths, all form the  foundational  elements  that  have  shaped  Hanmaum-Seonwon  into  a synthesized ‘building-blocks of religion.’"
Fault-Line Selection Method for Small-Current Grounded System Based on Multi-classifier,2023,"['Single-phase ground fault', 'Multi-classifier', 'Fault-line selection', 'Small-current grounded system']",,"In a small-current grounded system, the fault characteristics are very obscure when a single-phase ground fault occurs; therefore, the faulty line must be selected to remove it. This paper proposes a fault-line selection (FLS) method based on multi-classifier, which transforms FLS into a multi-classification problem. It solves the problems in traditional methods, such as low accuracy and high equipment cost. Multi-classifiers based on denoising Autoencoder(DAE) are used to reduce the dimension of historical dispatching data and extract single-phase ground-fault features. Firstly, the dispatching data are preprocessed to eliminate useless data and fill in vacancies. Then, the fault segments are marked and labeled samples containing steady-state and transient information of single-phase ground faults are obtained. Finally, a multi-classifier based on DAE is built, and this model is trained with labeled fault samples to obtain a high-accuracy FLS model. The experiments show that the accuracy of the proposed method exceeds 97%, which is much better than other data-driven models and traditional methods. The proposed method has been operating for over two years in a real power system south of China. The excellent performance of the proposed method for FLS in practice and simulation indicates a vast application potential."

However,  the  shallow  depths  in  these  regions present challenges for conventional vessel-based survey methods. Moreover, during low tides,  intertidal  zones  transform  into  tidal  flats,  limiting  the  efficiency  of  survey  efforts due  to  restricted  access  and  potential  risks.  As  a  result,  proper  underwater  cultural heritage surveys encounter difficulties in these environments. In recent times, extensive research  is  underway  to  address  these  issues  by  investigating  underwater  cultural heritage  surveys  in  intertidal  zones,  encompassing  diverse  fields,  including equipment-based  investigations.  This  study  aimed  to  explore  the  feasibility  of  utilizing unmanned  aerial  vehicles  (UAVs)  to  conduct  intertidal  cultural  heritage  surveys, employing  aerial  photography  and  3D  mapping  to  create  detailed  orthoimages  and  3D models.  The  study  focused  on  assessing  the  potential  application  of  these  techniques for cultural heritage surveying within intertidal zones. Notably, the survey conducted in Jindo's  Naesan-ri  demonstrated  high-resolution  capabilities,  enabling  the  distinction  of actual  pottery  fragments  mixed  within  gravel  fields.  Similarly,  in  the  survey  of  Jindo's Byeokpa-hang,  it  was  found  that  a  wooden  pillar  structure  existed  in  a  section  about 200m long. The integration of various sensors, including LiDAR, with UAVs allows for diverse  investigation  possibilities,  including  bathymetric  measurements,  and  is  expected to facilitate the acquisition of varied datasets for further research and assessment."

Practical Aspects of Instantaneous Magnetization Power Functions of Silicon Iron Laminations,2023,"['Instantaneous magnetization power', 'Equivalent circuits', 'Loss resistance', 'Silicon iron', 'Hysteresis', 'Eddy currents']",,"Magnetic energy loss P of SiFe steel represents a key factor for the efficiency of soft magnetic machine cores. Traditionally, they are operated with 50 Hz (or 60 Hz), a frequency value that yields rather balanced portions of hysteresis loss and eddy current loss. In equivalent circuits of transformers, P tends to be represented by a magnetic power resistance RM, as a constant. For the most important case of sinusoidal induction B of 50 Hz, this would correspond to an instantaneous magnetization power function p(t) that is sinusoidal as well, however, with 100 Hz (or 120 Hz). On the other hand, from complex, non-linear mechanisms of hysteresis, it is obvious that p(t) should be strongly non-sinusoidal, even for exactly sinusoidal B(t). So far, almost all corresponding instantaneous investigations were restricted to calculated modelling of loss portions and transient modelling. On the other hand, for the first time, the present study was focussed on functions p(t) as measured at IEC-standardized samples of industrially relevant steel. Practical evaluations are discussed with respect to the revealed “history” of magnetization processes, as well as for product characterization. For these tasks, a novel digitized “Low-mass Single Sheet Tester” was developed that was applied for both non-oriented steel (NO) and grain-oriented steel (GO), for 50 Hz. Interpretations proved to be favoured by relating p(t) to total P, according to an instantaneous power ratio. As a result, both steel types revealed strongly non-sinusoidal power functions, with short durations of negative p. Negative p proved to be most pronounced for NO steel, as a measure for the onset of reversible turns of atomic moments. As a consequence, p(t) comprises strong upper harmonics of 200 Hz and even 300 Hz. Based on theoretical considerations, we split p(t) in a dissipative loss power function pL(t) and in a potential energy power function pP(t). Finally, we used p(t) to determine the corresponding power resistance RM(t) that proves to be a distinctly nonlinear function as well. It resembles a rectified co-sinus, also exhibiting short negative spikes that reflect the crystallographic dis-orientation of the polycrystalline material."

This viewpoint starkly contrasts with the Yulgok school’s theory, which posits that the unified principle differentiates through qi 氣. In response, Jeon Woo critiqued Ki Jeong-jin by adhering to the doctrines of the Yulgok school. According to him, a species’ nature is wholly attributed to the influence of qi. Ki Jeong-jin’s disciple, Jeong Eui-rim, defended his teacher’s doctrine by embracing the organic model. He likened the relationship between Heaven and all things to that of the body and its limbs, contending that it embodies a ‘whole-part’ connection. Just as the parts coalesce to constitute the whole, the whole is omnipresent within the parts; similarly all things come together to form Heaven, and Heaven is omnipresent within all things. Based on this, Jeong Eui-rim concluded that all things ‘originally existed’ alongside Heaven, and further postulated that the li of all things originated from this ‘original existence.’ Consequently, his contention is not that the unified li differentiates into the li of all things through qi but that the li of all things inherently existed and evolved into the natures of various species."
Removal of fluoroquinolone antibiotics by adsorption of dopamine-modified biochar aerogel,2023,"['Adsorption', 'Biomass', 'Fluoroquinolone Antibiotics', 'Wastewater Treatment']",,"As emerging contaminants used for treating various tract infections, fluoroquinolones (such as enoxacin, ofloxacin, etc.) enter water bodies via point-source discharges of wastewater treatment plants and many of them raise environmental and health concerns. Herein, a novel adsorbent, derived from a useful renewable low-cost grapefruit peel, was prepared to investigate the adsorption behavior of fluoroquinolone antibiotics (enoxacin and ofloxacin). The obtained adsorbent was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermo-gravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC). Further, the equilibrium sorption of the adsorption process was analyzed with isotherm models and kinetic models. Under optimal adsorption conditions, equilibrium data conformed to the Elovich model, and the kinetics of adsorption was fitted well with Redlich-Peterson model. Combined with thermodynamic analysis, electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bond, π-π stacking interaction were the possible adsorption mechanisms for both fluoroquinolone antibiotics onto the novel adsorbent. This work explored a promising adsorbent for the elimination of fluoroquinolone antibiotics in environmental remediation."

AI is expected to be highly utilized in the broadcasting field in the future as the tasks of production, editing, and distribution.To develop a high-performance deep learning model for the content analysis of broadcast videos based on deep learning, it is necessary to get enough qualified learning data to learn the model. In this study, seven types of AI learning data using broadcasting videos released by the Korea Intelligence Information Society Agency (NIA) on AI Hub were analyzed in terms of design and sought standardization measures, especially focusing on classes. As of October 2022, AI Hub has established and released seven types of AI learning data worth a total of 10,895 hours using videos from nine broadcasters, including KBS, MBN, EBS, SBS, Maeil Economy TV, YTN, OBS, tvN, and Maeil Bussiness Newspaper.

In this study, various tasks were organized into objects, actions, and situations, and the format and class of source data and annotation data were standardized. Object and behavior classes into 3-level categorization, and then standardized their names. The situation was viewed as a combination of objects, actions, times, places, content, and emotions, and standardized by detailed units. Accordingly, we derived standardized classes of 28/212/1338 objects, 18/56/353 behaviors, 8/55 emotions, 8/55 content, 2/10 hours, and 25/92 places. According to the standardization results, there were 477 object classes with more than 4,000 bounding boxes and 41 behavioral classes with more than 300 clips. The standardization of AI hub broadcast video datasets can be useful to develop an integrated broadcasting database, to manage datasets efficiently. This study also contributes to the development of deep learning-based broadcast video analysis models and AI transformation in the broadcasting field."
No association between genetically predicted C-reactive protein levels and colorectal cancer survival in Korean: two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis,2023,"['Colorectal neoplasm', 'C-reactive protein', 'Survival analysis', 'Mendelian randomization analysis']",,"OBJECTIVES: Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are associated with an increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC), as well as a poor prognosis, but it remains unclear whether these associations are causal. This study examined the potential causality between CRP levels and CRC survival using 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). METHODS: From the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study, a genome-wide association study (n=59,605), 7 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to log2-transformed CRP levels were extracted as instrumental variables for CRP levels. The associations between the genetically predicted CRP and CRC-specific and overall mortality among CRC patients (n=6,460) were evaluated by Aalen’s additive hazard model. The sensitivity analysis excluded a SNP related to the blood lipid profile. RESULTS: During a median of 8.5 years of follow-up, among 6,460 CRC patients, 2,676 (41.4%) CRC patients died from all causes and 1,622 (25.1%) died from CRC. Genetically predicted CRP levels were not significantly associated with overall or CRC-specific mortality in CRC patients. The hazard difference per 1,000 person-years for overall and CRC-specific mortality per 2-fold increase in CRP levels was -2.92 (95% confidence interval [CI], -14.05 to 8.21) and -0.76 (95% CI, -9.61 to 8.08), respectively. These associations were consistent in a subgroup analysis according to metastasis and a sensitivity analysis excluding possible pleiotropic SNPs. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support a causal role for genetically predisposed CRP levels in CRC survival."
Evaluation and classification of stator turn‑to‑turn faults using electrical equivalent circuits for surface permanent magnet brushless direct current motors,2023,"['Turn-to-turn fault', 'Current signature analysis', 'Neural network', 'Surface permanent magnet motor']",,"Stator turn-to-turn faults occur due to improper loading, eccentricity in the rotor, and increases in the operating temperature. During the occurrence of a stator turn-to-turn fault, an abnormal temperature increase occurs, and if this state is left unattended for a long duration, it can lead to degradation of the permanent magnet. This paper presents an analytical modeling scheme for surface permanent magnet brushless DC motors for diagnosing and classifying stator turn-to-turn faults using SIMULINK® during non-stationary operating conditions. A significant increase in the stator current, back EMF, torque, and speed is observed. A current signature analysis is performed during non-stationary operating conditions using a fast Fourier transform method to identify the severity of the fault. Furthermore, a simple and efficient classification model is developed by selecting the best classifier among the decision trees, neural network, support vector machine, discriminant analysis, and ensemble classifier. A statistical evaluation of the current signal for fault feature extraction and ranking is performed based on minimum redundancy and maximum relevance, Chi-square test, Relief F, analysis of variance, and Kruskal–Wallis test. The dataset for classification is extracted from a Simulink analytical model. Neural network-based classifiers can classify faults precisely and rapidly with a minimum number of features."
Engineering TGF-β Inhibitor-encapsulated Macrophage-inspired Multi-functional Nanoparticles for Combination Cancer Immunotherapy,2023,"['Cancer immunotherapy', 'Tumor-associated macrophage', 'Immune cell-inspired nanoparticle', 'TGF-β inhibition', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Combination therapy']",,"Background The emergence of cancer immunotherapies, notably immune checkpoint inhibitors, has revolutionized anti-cancer treatments. These treatments, however, have been reported to be effective in a limited range of cancers and cause immune-related adverse effects. Thus, for a broader applicability and enhanced responsiveness to solid tumor immunotherapy, immunomodulation of the tumor microenvironment is crucial. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) has been implicated in reducing immunotherapy responsiveness by promoting M2-type differentiation of macrophages and facilitating cancer cell metastasis.Methods In this study, we developed macrophage membrane-coated nanoparticles loaded with a TGF-βR1 kinase inhibitor, SD-208 (M -SDNP). Inhibitions of M2 macrophage polarization and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancer cells were comprehensively evaluated through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Bio-distribution study and in vivo therapeutic effects of M -SDNP were investigated in orthotopic breast cancer model and intraveneously injected metastasis model.Results M -SDNPs effectively inhibited cancer metastasis and converted the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (cold tumor) into an immunostimulatory tumor microenvironment (hot tumor), through specific tumor targeting and blockade of M2-type macrophage differentiation. Administration of M -SDNPs considerably augmented the population of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the tumor tissue, thereby significantly enhancing responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitors, which demonstrates a robust anti-cancer effect in conjunction with anti-PD-1 antibodies.Conclusion Collectively, responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitors was considerably enhanced and a robust anti-cancer effect was demonstrated with the combination treatment of M -SDNPs and anti-PD-1 antibody. This suggests a promising direction for future therapeutic strategies, utilizing bio-inspired nanotechnology to improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy."
Protective effect and mechanism of ginsenoside Rg2 on atherosclerosis,2023,"['ginsenoside Rg2', 'atherosclerosis', 'endothelial cell', 'inflammation', 'signaling pathway']",,"Background: Ginsenoside Rg2 (Rg2) has a variety of pharmacological activities and provides benefits during inflammation, cancer, and other diseases. However, there are no reports about the relationship between Rg2 and atherosclerosis. Methods: We used 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) to detect the cell viability of Rg2 in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The expression of inflammatory factors in HUVECs and the expression of phenotypic transformation-related marker in VSMCs were detected at mRNA levels. Western blot method was used to detect the expression of inflammation pathways and the expression of phenotypic transformation at the protein levels. The rat carotid balloon injury model was performed to explore the effect of Rg2 on inflammation and phenotypic transformation in vivo. Results: Rg2 decreased the expression of inflammatory factors induced by lipopolysaccharide in HUVECs-without affecting cell viability. These events depend on the blocking regulation of NF-κB and p-ERK signaling pathway. In VSMCs, Rg2 can inhibit the proliferation, migration, and phenotypic transformation of VSMCs induced by platelet derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB)-which may contribute to its anti-atherosclerotic role. In rats with carotid balloon injury, Rg2 can reduce intimal proliferation after injury, regulate the inflammatory pathway to reduce inflammatory response, and also suppress the phenotypic transformation of VSMCs. Conclusion: These results suggest that Rg2 can exert its anti-atherosclerotic effect at the cellular level and animal level, which provides a more sufficient basis for ginseng as a functional dietary regulator."
Cross‑domain health status assessment of three‑phase inverters using improved DANN,2023,"['Health status assessment', 'Transfer learning', 'Deep residual network', 'Domain adversarial neural network']",,"Information and large number of fault labels are required to achieve intelligent health status assessment of three-phase inverters. However, the current signals of inverters cannot be sufficiently collected since open-circuit faults (OCFs) occur briefly, which makes it difficult to determine the OCF mode of the various power switches. A transfer learning model that effectively uses a small amount of sample data to achieve domain adaptation is proposed to address this problem. First, collected fault-sensitive signals are subjected to a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to obtain two-dimensional image data with more abundant fault feature information. Second, the source domain and target domain features are projected into the same feature space through a domain adversarial neural network (DANN) to achieve multi-domain feature extraction and adaptation. Then, in the feature extraction module of the DANN, the deep residual network (Resnet) structure is used to replace the typical convolutional neural network (CNN) structure. Finally, an intelligent diagnosis network is used to identify the health status of the inverter samples under variable conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed model can accurately and effectively realize the cross-domain health assessment of three-phase inverters in the case of small samples. The accuracy of the proposed model is better than that of other classical transfer learning models."
YBCO polycrystal co-added with BaTiO3 and WO3 nanoparticles: Fluctuation induced conductivity and pseudogap studies,2023,"['Superconductor', 'Addition', 'Fluctuation induced conductivity', 'Pseudogap', 'Local pair']",,We report the effect of the addition of BaTiO3 and WO3 nanoparticles on the pseudogap and excess conductivity of YBCO polycrystal. The excess conductivity analysis showed that the experimental data of pure and sample added with low amount of WO3 and BaTiO3 were perfectly described by the 2D Maki-Thompson (MT) and 3D Aslamazov-Larkin (AL) models. A sharp decrease in excess conductivity was obtained for samples added with high amount of nanoparticles where the analysis indicated the presence of the AL contribution and Lawrence- Doniach (LD) models. The pseudogap (PG) results showed that the value of Tpair (the temperature at which local pairs are transformed from strongly bound bosons into the fluctuating Cooper pairs) increased from around 117 K for the pure sample to around 187 K for sample co-added with low amount of nanoparticles. The pseudogap Δ*(TG) reduced from 230.9 K (for pure sample) to 223.4 K (for added sample).

The three-dimensional (3D) shape information collected from the two sensors is used to derive an initial 3D transformation relationship between the two sensors. Next, the intersections between the four facets of the pyramid-shaped object are used in conjunction with a minimization algorithm to improve the precision of the 3D transformation relationship. The proposed method is applied to an actual foot scanning system to calibrate the upper and lower 3D sensors of the foot scanner, and the 3D model is reconstructed. The performance of this method is verified by comparing the reconstructed models with ground truth models. The calibration error between the two sensors was less than 0.6 mm on average when using the proposed calibration method. The proposed method offers the advantage of simple operation as it uses a single sheet of paper, thus avoiding the difficulties encountered in conventional calibration methods."

Puss in Boots, who appeared as a supporting role in <Shrek2>, is a character derived from Charles Perrault's The Master Cat or Puss in Boots, and has gained significant popularity among the public. Due to its popularity, Puss in Boots became the main character in <Puss in Boots1>, a spin-off of <Shrek2>. Subsequently, as <Puss in Boots1> achieved success, various transmedia content featuring Puss in Boots as the main character was produced across different media platforms, including mobile games, theatrical animations, OTT animations and interactive animation.This article aims to provide a detailed examination of the requirements and characteristics of transmedia storytelling. It also analyzes various instances of transmedia content utilizing the character of Puss in Boots. To scrutinize the transformation of characters' roles and the expansion of narrative structures, which are essential aspects of transmedia storytelling, we apply the 'actantial model' developed by A.J. Greimas to each content. Through this analysis, we can explore how the character of Puss in Boots serves as a pivotal link between transmedia contents and functions as a narrative mechanism. It becomes evident that discovering archetypal and fantasy characters, adapting their roles and personalities, and strategically reintroducing secondary characters while setting up foreshadowing are crucial elements in successful transmedia storytelling. Furthermore, it is essential to create an ""integral"" story universe that considers various types of connections between content, such as sequels, prequels, spin-offs, and reboots. This should be done while leveraging diversified media platforms that engage users in immersion and participation."

To this end, we first defined a parameter, “elastic preload”, and predicted the changes in the performance of the TPJB, as a function of the preload amount. We used the iso-viscosity Reynolds equation, which ignores the temperature rise due to viscous shear in thin films, and the resultant thermal deformation of the bearing structure. We employed a three-dimensional finite element model to predict the elastic deformation of the bearing pad, and a transient analysis, to converge to a static equilibrium condition of the flexible pads and journal. Conducting a modal coordinate transformation helped us avoid heavy computational issues arising from a mesh refinement in the three-dimensional finite element pad model. Moreover, we adopted the Hertzian contact model to predict the elastic deformation at the pivot location. With the aforementioned overall strategy, we predicted the performance changes owing to the elastic deformation of the pad under varying load conditions. From the results, we observed an increase in the preload due to the pad elastic deformation."

The question discussed in this paper is: How satisfied are the elderly with the level of aging-appropriateness of existing urban community service facilities? What are the differences in the satisfaction and needs of the elderly in the old and new urban communities for the level of appropriate aging in the community? What are the commonalities of the elderly's needs for the aging-friendly renovation in urban communities? It will provide empirical support for the aging-appropriate transformation of communities in my country, and then provide empirical support for the establishment of a model elderly-friendly community. (Method) This paper first summarizes the relevant research through literature review, and finds that the research results of aging adaptation evaluation based on the perspective of combining the satisfaction and needs of the elderly are relatively missing. Using the theory of the fit between people and environment, investigate the satisfaction and transformation needs of the elderly in new and old urban communities to the community service facilities and public activity space. (Results) The results of this survey also show that the aging adaptability level of community service facilities in old urban communities is generally low, and the elderly in old communities are less satisfied with the aging adaptability level of the community. In terms of the aging adaptation needs of the elderly in new and old communities, for the elderly living alone, they are unaccompanied and mainly engaged in community activities. There is a strong demand for increasing community entertainment facilities and recreational facilities. (Conclusions) This paper draws the following main conclusions: 1, based on the self-assessment health, self-care ability and living style of the elderly, we should focus on strengthening the transformation of barrier free facilities in urban communities with poor health, partial self-care and disability, and living alone. 2、 The elderly in the new community are more satisfied with the basic public service facilities, municipal supporting infrastructure and community public activity space than those in the old community. 3、 In terms of the needs for aging adaptation of community service facilities, the self-rated ""poor"" elderly, some self-care and disabled elderly, and the elderly living alone have a high demand for community entertainment facilities and recreational facilities, and the proportion of the elderly in need exceeds 50%. Through the investigation of the elderly's satisfaction with and needs for community aging, we can measure the direction of community aging transformation. To a certain extent, it can provide experience support for the direction of urban community aging transformation."
Arsenic Contamination of Groundwater a Grave Concern: Novel Clay-based Materials for Decontamination of Arsenic (V),2023,"['Arsenic (V)', 'Natural clay', 'Synthetic hectorite', 'Intercalated zirconium clay', 'Nanocomposite']",,"Arsenic is a highly toxic element, and its contamination is widespread around the world. The natural materials with high selectivity and efficiency toward pollutants are important in wastewater treatment technology. In this study, the mesoporous synthetic hectorite was synthesized by facile hydrothermal crystallization of gels comprising silica, magnesium hydroxide, and lithium fluoride. Additionally, the naturally available clay was modified using zirconium at room temperature. Both synthetic and modified natural clays were employed in the removal of arsenate from aquatic environments. The materials were fully characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) analyses. The synthesized materials were used to remove arsenic (V) under varied physicochemical conditions. Both materials, i.e., Zr-bentonite and Zr-hectorite, showed high percentage removal of arsenic (V) at lower pH, and the efficiency decreased in an alkaline medium. The equilibrium-state sorption data agrees well with the Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms, and the maximum sorption capacity is found to be 4.608 and 2.207 mg/g for Zr-bentonite and Zr-hectorite, respectively. The kinetic data fits well with the pseudo-second order kinetic model. Furthermore, the effect of the background electrolytes study indicated that arsenic (V) is specifically sorbed at the surface of these two nanocomposites. This study demonstrated that zirconium intercalated synthetic hectorite as well as zirconium modified natural clays are effective and efficient materials for the selective removal of arsenic (V) from aqueous medium."

Wifely submission was recommended by a group of mid- to late-eighteenth-century “Matriarchal” female writers as a tool for establishing a practical female domestic and civic authority. Published years earlier than most of the writings that promoted the female authority based on apparent obedience, Memoirs nevertheless presents a prescient critique of the ideal of the respectably obedient wife by elucidating the model’s psychological instability and harmful effects on social cohesion. The novel employs the sentimental epistolary narrative to highlight the deep-seated and self-centered desire for moral probity that upholds the submissive wife’s self-discipline but ultimately transforms her into a negative authority figure who destroys the happiness of both herself and her admirers. The torrential use of tragic events in Memoirs reflects the author’s urgent yet careful search for a female authority stable enough to withstand the personal, familial, social, and political resistance to the mid-century British women’s endeavors to claim their deserved place in the family, society, and nation."

The present study examined gender differences in the mean scores and the associations among children’s perceived interparental conflict, social anxiety, and aggression. Ten Grade 4 classes in Gyeonggi area participated in the survey, measuring perceived interparental conflict and social anxiety from children’s self-reports and aggression through their homeroom teachers, and data from 278 children were analyzed. Mean-level gender differences were analyzed by independent samples t-test, and gendered relationships were tested using Fisher’s z transformation of bivariate correlation coefficients and multi-group structural equation modeling. The gender effect was not statistically significant in children’s perception of interparental conflict, whereas girls reported significantly higher social anxiety and lower aggression than boys. Perceived interparental conflict was more strongly correlated with and was a stronger predictor of social anxiety for girls than boys. Configural and partial metric invariance of the hypothesized model was supported across gender, with nonequivalent factor loadings of aggression for boys and girls. Perception of interparental conflict was marginally significantly correlated with only girls’ aggression but, at the latent variable level, did not predict aggression regardless of gender. Gender differences in the negative impact of interparental conflict on children’s development and adjustment were discussed, and limitations of this study and directions for future research were suggested."

"Acceptance and Demand Estimation of Demand Responsive Transit (DRT) in a Least Developed Country: The Case of Paratransit in Vientiane, Lao PDR",2023,"['paratransit', 'developing country', 'demand-responsive transit', 'demand estimation']",,"Conventional public transport systems in developing countries such as the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), are commonly substandard, unreliable, and often have insufficient accessibility and connectivity. In many cases, paratransit, utilizing various passenger vehicles (such as trucks, TukTuks, and motorcycles), compensate for the deficiencies of conventional public transport, offering a valuable alternative for passengers. For developing nations, enhancing conventional public transport or introducing new modes requires considerable time and investment, resources that may be limited. As an alternative, this study investigates the feasibility of transforming paratransit services into Demand Responsive Transit (DRT), aiming to formalize and integrate them with existing public transport, thereby improving connectivity, accessibility, and increasing the public transport mode share. To assess the potential acceptance, future demand, and mode share of DRT in Vientiane, Lao PDR, we conducted an opinion and stated preference survey, employed a multinomial logit choice model, and used an origin-to-destination network assignment model. The findings suggest that respondents are keen on using DRT in conjunction with Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in the future.

This paper analyzes Pastor Lee Young-hoon’s spirituality and leadership using the key word “Absolute Positivity.” Lee learned the concept of “the Spirituality of Absolute Positivity” from his devout family,  his  mother,  and  Pastor  Cho  Yong-gi.  Lee  also  underwent life-long  training  in  this  spiritual  perspective  through  his  life  and ministry.  Lee  also  committed  himself  to  his  ministry,  making  Jesus Christ the model of “Absolute Positivity” and bearing abundant fruits.The foundation of Lee’s leadership of Absolute Positivity is rooted in his example of positivity and the ministry motto and vision of “Absolute Positivity,  and  Absolute  Gratitude.”  The  form  of Lee’s  Absolute Positivity reflects the character of Jesus Christ. The primary function of Lee’s leadership based on Absolute Positivity is to promote spiritual revival in individuals and within the church. Lastly, the focus of Lee’s Absolute  Positivity  is  to  establish  the  Kingdom  of  God  in  society through practice of love and spiritual transformation. While Pastor Cho Yong-gi  had  emphasized  the  spirituality  of hope of the  fourth dimension, making much of the gifts and personality of the Holy Spirit, Pastor Lee Young-hoon, inheriting Cho’s spiritual legacy well, has also emphasized  the  spirituality  of Absolute  Positivity,  making  much  of personal sanctification (the character of Jesus) and social sanctification of the Holy Spirit. If Pastor Cho Yong-gi can be described as a “Pastor of Hope,” Pastor Lee Young-hoon can be evaluated as a “Pastor of Absolute Positivity.”"
Therapeutic effects of TMF and catechol in pulmonary fibrosis: in vitro and in vivo analysis,2023,"['Catechol', 'Pulmonary fibrosis', 'ROS', 'TMF']",,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a fatal lung disorder characterized by abnormal deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), which is secreted by activated myofibroblasts. While the origin of myofibroblasts has been discussed, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is being noticed as one of the mechanisms of myofibroblast activation. Recent studies have shown that reactive oxygen species appear to induce not only EMT but also fibrotic progression and maintenance. Therefore, we tested chemicals that have antioxidant capacity as drugs for fibrosis. To evaluate the effects of 4′,6,7-trimethoxyisoflavone (TMF) and catechol (CAT) on EMT and fibrosis, we used an in vitro transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 or bleomycin-induced model and an in vivo BLM-induced model. The results showed that the co-administration of TMF/CAT ameliorated pulmonary fibrosis by decreasing EMT and ECM accumulation by hindering both Smad and non-Smad TGF-β signalling cascades. Furthermore, significant increases in the number of total immune cells (especially lymphocytes) were observed in BLM-treated animals treated with TMF/CAT. Our findings suggest that co-intervention with TMF/CAT may be a potential treatment for fibrosis."
Electrolytic capacitorless STATCOM with both inductive and capacitive VAR compensation modes,2023,"['STATCOM', 'Power decoupling', 'Flux cancellation method', 'VAR compensation']",,"This paper proposes an effective VAR source established as a cascaded H-bridge (CHB) static compensator (STATCOM), which is based on the flux cancellation method. The conventional CHB-STATCOM uses a low-frequency large capacitor as a source. The required capacitance value of the capacitor increases as a function of the amount of VAR produced to compensate the power system. The proposed topology is based on flux cancellation. Therefore, the source of VAR in this case is not limited by the capacitors or the power decoupling transformer size. The sub-module (SM) of the proposed topology comprises of a CHB module with power decoupling circuits. The double-frequency ripple powers on the sub-module (SM) capacitors, which have a phase shift of 120° with respect to each other. The ripple powers are derived from each of the three phases toward a common magnetic core to cancel each other out. An isolated bidirectional triple port dual half-bridge converter is utilized for the flux cancellation process. In this converter, the main challenges are leakage inductances and the high voltage insulation among the three windings of the high-frequency transformer. An αβ-frame-based model is proposed, using the generalized state-space averaging method, for the flux cancellation circuit. Furthermore, the size is significantly reduced by the proposed method, since a small sub-module capacitance of a few microfarads is sufficient to operate the CHBSTATCOM. The analysis and the controller design process are presented, followed by simulation and hardware validations."

Firstly, the combination of natural objects is utilized to obtain creative prototypes through observation of the natural world. Mushrooms and butterflies, peacocks and butterflies, flowers and butterflies, and growing flowers that can present natural changes are selected as design themes, which can break through the inherent design impression of natural themes and reinterpret new ideas for hat design. Secondly, the comprehensive expression of naturalistic and eco-friendly concepts. It transforms form and color by imitating the model of natural objects into concrete and abstract hat design features, and then utilizing the creative combination of recycled materials to surpass the singularity of existing hat materials, enhancing naturalistic concepts and eco-friendly design awareness. Thirdly, the artistic expression of hidden beauty. It depends on natural curves and covering facial design, so that presents an artistic visual expression. These results indicate that the fusion of naturalistic and eco-friendly design features can achieve artistic hat design effects, and then provides creative design space for the future trend of hat design."

The system creates an Operation Plan Database (OP DB) to construct an operation plan knowledge base. It selects candidate operation plans based on user requests and situational information, evaluates them, and provides the recommended options. The key focus of this system is to build a high-quality operation plan knowledge base, which is directly linked to the OP DB. This paper presents a design approach for the OP DB, aiming to establish a knowledge base for an AI-driven automated system for mid-level measure recommendations. The design process involves deriving OP DB elements through doctrinal considerations of operation plan development, defining the implementation approach for each derived OP DB element to be included in the database, and ultimately generating an OP DB for potential situations, ensuring the suitability of the application approach for each OP DB element. The resulting OP DB is then transformed into a knowledge graph to build the knowledge base. During this study, we identified components for transforming the intangible aspects of tactics into a knowledge base. Additionally, we established an operational plan database that can be utilized to provide design guides and facilitate the development of AI models."
High level of LncRNA MAPKAPK5-AS1 predicts poor prognosis and contributes to the malignant proliferation and EMT of non-small cell lung cancer via sponging miR-490-3p from HMGB2,2023,['NSCLC · MAPKAPK5-AS1 · miR-490-3p · HMGB2 · Proliferation'],,"Background Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) show a low survival rate, owing to the lack of early diagnostic method and high invasiveness. Long non-coding RNA MAPKAPK5-AS1 that regulates tumor genesis and progression through multiple signals, is upregulated and involved in the growth and apoptosis in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).Objective To investigate whether MAPKAPK5-AS1 affected the malignant progression of NSCLC.Methods The levels of MAPKAPK5-AS1, miR-490-3p and HMGB2 in lung cancer were first analyzed through StarBase website, and confirmed by a quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. The biological functions of NSCLC cells were examined by CCK-8, 5-ethynyl-2ʹ-deoxyuridine (EdU) and flow cytometry assays. The potential binding sequences lncRNA-miRNA and miRNA-mRNA were predicted by StarBase software and verified via dual luciferase reporter experiment. The effects of MAPKAPK5-AS1 on tumor growth were evaluated in a xenografted mice model.Results The expression of MAPKAPK5-AS1 was upregulated in tumor tissues from NSCLC patients. Patients with high expression of MAPKAPK5-AS1 had higher tumor size, advanced TNM stage, higher incidence of lymph node and distant metastasis, and shorter overall survival. Knockdown of MAPKAPK5-AS1 inhibited the proliferation, induced apoptosis and blocked epithelial mesenchymal transformation (EMT) of NSCLC cells. Mechanically, MAPKAPK5-AS1 could upregulate the HMGB2 level in NSCLC cells through competitively binding to miR-490-3p. MiR-490-3p inhibitor reversed the roles of MAPKAPK5-AS1 knockdown on tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis and EMT. Also, HMGB2 knockdown suppressed tumor cell malignant phenotypes. Furthermore, interference of MAPKAPK5-AS1 slowed NSCLC tumor growth in vivo.Conclusion Knockdown of MAPKAPK5-AS1 inhibited the aggressive tumor phenotypes through miR-490-3p/HMGB2 axis in NSCLC. MAPKAPK5-AS1/miR-490-3p/HMGB2 might be potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets for NSCLC."
현대 영성과 초대 신비 사상,2023,"['영성', '신비주의', '초대교회', '오리겐', '닛사의 그레고리', 'Spirituality', 'Mysticism', 'Early Church', 'Origen', 'Gregory of Nyssa']",,"This paper investigates the recent phenomenon of Protestant Christians increasingly introducing the term 'spirituality' when discussing faith and religion. It is an attempt to identify the cause and meaning of such a phenomenon and to prepare appropriate countermeasures. While researching by synthesizing scholars' claims and reports on this phenomenon, the author found that the recent interest in spirituality expresses a thirst caused by a spiritual deficiency. This thirst is due to the separation of theology from its source, spirituality—that is, the experience of encountering the Ultimate. Research focusing on these problems and seeking solutions is becoming increasingly active and is called the studies of Christian spirituality. Researchers in this field pursue the restoration of harmony between spirituality and theology by emphasizing the importance of believers encountering the ultimate God in their lives and experiencing transformation through this experience. To achieve this, they focus on three tasks: the first is to present a vision for a transcendent life. The second is to provide guidance and training virtues for spiritual growth and transformation. Finally, the third is understanding the journey from the beginning to the perfection of this transformative life. While conducting research, the author became convinced that exploration of the mystical thoughts of the early church would be of great help in modern Christian spirituality scholars’ research. The teachings of early thinkers who uniquely synthesized theology and devotion will greatly support carrying out the three tasks of spirituality presented above. Therefore, it is inevitable that early mystical thought serves as a model for integrating spirituality and theology that we must pursue today and for resolving our spiritual thirst."
Improved Classification of Brain-Tumor MRI Images Through Data Augmentation and Filter Application,2023,"['Brain tumor', 'Computer-aided diagnosis', 'Classification', 'Deep learning', 'MRI']",,"Early diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors can lead to high cure rates. Specialists typically use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images to diagnose tumors, and accurate diagnosis is crucial for initiating early treatment. This study proposes a computer-aided specialized system for brain-tumor classification using MRI images that can assist specialists in diagnosing brain tumors. We used an object classification algorithm based on deep-learning networks and augmented the dataset using the ImageNet augmentation policy of AutoAugment to optimize brain-tumor classification performance. Gaussian filtering was applied to enhance the quality of MRI images by removing white Gaussian noise; the parameter value that exhibited relatively high performance in MRI images was determined by varying the sigma values of the Gaussian filter. To evaluate the performance of the proposed technique, we used EfficientNetV2-L(21 K) based on a convolutional neural network and ViT-L/16(21 K) based on transformers. The proposed technique improved the performance of both models. EfficientNetV2-L (21 K) achieved a performance improvement of 2.87% and an accuracy of 0.9590, while ViT-L/16 (21 K) achieved a performance improvement of 4.46% and an accuracy of 0.9413."
HIGH DEFINITION MAP AIDED OBJECT DETECTION FOR AUTONOMOUS DRIVING IN URBAN AREAS,2023,"['Autonomous driving', 'Object detection', 'Deep learning', 'High definition map', 'Self-localizat']",,"Detecting object locations and semantic classes in an image, such as traffic signs, traffic lights, and guide signs, is the crucial problem for autonomous driving, known as object detection. However, stable object detection in complex real-world environments, such as urban environments, is still challenging because of clutter, time of day, blur etc., even with modern deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). On the other hand, a high definition (HD) map is a pre-built information resource for autonomous driving tasks, especially for controls. Besides controls, HD map utilization for detection tasks has been gaining attention in recent years, enabling us to stabilize detection even in complex real-world environments. However, it is challenging to use object information from an HD map as detection directly because the self-localization error affects the transformed object locations on the image coordinate system from the HD map’s coordinate system. This paper explores incorporating HD map information into deep feature maps of a DCNN-based model. Two proposed modules implicitly make the feature extraction efficient and stable by utilizing HD map information. As a result of the experiments, the proposed module improved a modern model for challenging images of the urban area Shinjuku by 37 % in mAP, even in self-localization errors."
Evaluation of Single-Phase DC–AC Converters with Condition Monitoring Algorithm of Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors Using Artificial Learnings with Various Circuit Signals and Filtering Combinations,2023,"['Capacitor estimations', 'Condition monitoring', 'Aluminum capacitors', 'Artificial learning']",,"Capacitors are essential parts of power converters since the cost, size, and performance of converters are mainly dependent on them. Nevertheless, the capacitor is the most degeneration device among all converter parts owing to its aging failures and little lifetime. Thus, the monitoring process is an essential route for valuing health status and gives predictive maintenance to ensure steadiness in electric converter. The equivalent series resistance and the capacitance are commonly indexes employed for estimating the condition grade of capacitors. In this research, six artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are adopted to estimate the aluminum capacitor (Al-Cap) parameters in the single-phase inverter system. Various circuit signals, such as load voltage and current, capacitor voltage and current, are examined by utilizing the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) analysis and the combinations of fast Fourier transform with various filters. The considered signals are handled as AI model’s inputs to guesstimate the health status of the Al-cap. In addition, the root-mean-square value is employed as an index to compare the accuracy with the analyzed signals. Furthermore, several indicators are mixed to acquire the best recipes for capacitor health evaluation."
区域创新能力与区域经济发展的耦合协调度研究 -以中国为例,2023,"['China', 'Region', 'Regional Innovation Capacity', 'Regional Economic Development', 'Coupling Coordination Degree', '中国', '区域', '区域创新能力', '区域经济发展', '耦合协调度']",,"At present, China’s economy has entered a new normal, with the economic growth rate changing from medium to high speed growth. However, many economic and social problems have emerged as a result of this rapid development, such as the ageing of the population and environmental pollution. Changing the traditional sloppy growth approach to one that relies on innovation as the core strategy for China’s economic development has become a necessary measure for China’s economic development under the new normal.Innovation is not only one of the factors determining regional competitiveness, it is also an engine of economic development and plays an important role in breaking the trap of middle-income countries. Combined with the characteristics of China’s current stage of economic development, new changes in innovation factors and innovation-driven transformation should be realized as soon as possible, leading China to achieve long-term sustainable economic development. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the current situation of the coupled and coordinated development of the two and to study and analyze the relationship between them, which has important reference significance for regional economic development. Based on previous research, this paper constructs a regional innovation capacity evaluation system from three perspectives: innovation input, innovation output and innovation environment. The regional economic development evaluation system has been constructed in six dimensions: economic stability, economic efficiency, economic coordination, economic openness, economic sharing, and economic greenness. On this basis, the coupled and coordinated development of regional innovation capacity and regional economic development in 30 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions of China were analyzed from four-time points, 2006, 2010, 2015, and 2020, using the coupled and coordinated degree model. The results show that the quadrant of the composite score of regional innovation capacity and regional economic development shows that most provinces, cities, and autonomous regions in China are below the average level of regional innovation capacity and regional economic development. China’s overall coupling coordination is at a moderate level of coordination and is still far from the high coordination stage. The number of provinces at high and very high levels of coordination is small, but they are all located in the economically developed eastern regions. The vast majority of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in the medium and low levels of coordination are in the lagging innovation capacity category. The coupling coordination of the four regions shows a characteristic of Eastern regions> Central regions> Northeast regions> Western regions."

To this end, research models and hypotheses were established through theoretical discussions on major variables. For empirical analysis, data was collected through a survey of the headquarters of Gangwon State and public officials in 18 cities and counties. The hypothesis was verified using a structural equation model. As a result of the empirical analysis, the psychological strength, a key research topic of the study, has a significant effect on organizational effectiveness in which both psychological capital and psychological ownership are discussed as dependent variables in organizational behavior theory, and in the case of mediating effects, some paths are significant in the relationship between leadership and organizational effectiveness. This suggests that active management and development of the psychological strengths of local public officials can improve the dependence and problems of local public officials' organizations on organizational management paths, change the rigid organizational culture of public officials, improve the negative impact of organizational failure, and further improve the performance of organizational members and organizations."

Most notably, tangible currency or cash is coming to an end in low- and middle-income countries and the era of digital currency has begun. Additionally, a new competition between public and private currencies is about to begin, both nationally and internationally. The proliferation of digital technologies driving these changes can encourage useful innovation and expand access to basic financial services. However, there is also a risk that technology will encourage concentration of economic power, leading to greater involvement by large corporations and governments in our finances and personal lives.Although new technologies are creating online banks that can reach more customers and web-based platforms like Prosper that can connect depositors and borrowers directly, traditional financial institutions, especially commercial banks, are facing challenges in their business models.

Accordingly, this study attempted to analyze papers in China over the past 10 years on the ‘副+名’ phrase to diagnose the current status of research and explore new research directions that are considered worth studying in the future.This paper collected a total of 87 papers since 2010 (2010-2023) from CNKI, a Chinese academic database. In the analysis of the research status of Chapter II of this paper, the timing of the emergence of the phrase ‘副+名’, changes in scholars' perceptions of non-normative phrases, and the characteristics of research trends by period were examined. The emergence of ‘副+名’ has already begun in ancient Chinese, and it can be seen that scholars' perception of the ‘副+名’ phrase is now a process of finding a reasonable cause in the confrontation between opposition and recognition. The number of research papers with the phrase ‘副+名’ has been gradually drawing a downward curve since the early 2010s and then drawing an upward curve again from 2023. In the study's contents, the frequency was high in the order of ""grammar> meaning, cognition> cause of appearance, universal motivation> bilingual contrast> rhetoric> dialect, translation> foreign Chinese, normality."" In particular, papers related to investigation were classified separately. The phrase ‘副+名’ has excellent rhetorical effect, differs from the scope of research in lexical and grammatical studies, and is sometimes used transformatively, breaking conventional rules.

Introduction As consumers have adapted to a non-face-to-face living environment due to COVID-19 and diversified their food consumption behaviors, the online food shopping market has been experiencing continuous growth (Jung & Moon, 2020). With the market expansion, competition has intensified as a large number of new platforms have entered the market. To ensure market share and sustain business growth, it has become essential for platforms to implement appropriate product strategies to improve consumer trust (Kang & Nam, 2022). Improving consumer trust can positively impact on the company's long-term performance by increasing consumer awareness of the product and fostering persistent purchase intentions (Liu & Tang, 2018). Additionally, prior research has shown that consumers’ trust in the platform significantly influences online word-of-mouth (Brown & Reingen, 1987). Based on these findings, this study aims to address the following questions: First, how does the product strategy implemented by the food e-commerce platforms affect consumers’ e-WOM about the platforms? Second, does this impact vary based on the overall level of consumer interest in the consumption market? 2. Hypotheses Development Consumer trust in a product or service plays a crucial role in their intentions to engage in e-WOM. The credibility of a brand can influence consumers’ purchasing behavior and their willingness to maintain ongoing relationships or share related experiences (Sam & Tahir, 2010; Trivedi & Yadav, 2020). In the context of Food e-commerce platforms, different strategies can be employed to build consumer trust, such as reinforcing category expertise to enhance expert-based trust or reinforcing eco-friendly elements to enhance benevolence-based trust (Kim & Lee, 2014). Moreover, as consumer interest increases, it may lead to an upsurge in information search behavior and higher expectations, potentially resulting in expectation discrepancies (Shin & Park, 2020). Based on these discussions, the following hypotheses have been formulated. To test the hypotheses, the research model was constructed as shown in Figure 1.[H1] Implementing a strategy to reinforce fresh food category expertise will have a positive relationship with the amount of e-WOM about the platform.[H2] Implementing a strategy to reinforce eco-friendly elements will have a positive relationship with the amount of e-WOM about the platform.[H3] As the search volume of fresh food-related keyword increases, the positive relationship between the amount of e-WOM and a strategy to reinforce fresh food category expertise will weaken.[H4] As the search volume of eco-friendly-related keyword increases, the positive relationship between the amount of e-WOM and a strategy to reinforce eco-friendly elements will weaken.3. Data and Analysis To test the hypotheses, the authors collected e-WOM data related to each online food delivery platform, consisting of the amount of e-WOM per-week for 14 platforms from January 2017 to December 2020, a period when the food e-commerce market experienced continuous growth of more than 100%.The dependent variable in the study is the amount of e-WOM for each online food delivery platform on major domestic social media. To address potential outliers and heteroscedasticity in the data, the authors employed a log transformation. There are two types of independent variables used in the study: First, a binary variable was created to measure whether the platform reinforced fresh food category expertise, using the time when the platform established its own specialized page for fresh food.

Concurrently, studies are also underway to develop methods for automatically surveying the condition of various on-board equipment remotely to ensure the navigational safety of MASS. One key issue that has gained prominence is the method to obtain values from analog gauges installed in various equipment through image processing. This approach has the advantage of enabling the non-contact detection of gauge values without modifying or changing already installed or planned equipment, eliminating the need for type approval changes from shipping classifications. The objective of this study was to identify a dynamically changing indicator needle within noisy images of analog gauges. The needle object must be identified because its position significantly affects the accurate reading of gauge values. An analog pressure gauge attached to an emergency fire pump model was used for image capture to identify the needle object. The acquired images were pre-processed through Gaussian filtering, thresholding, and morphological operations. The needle object was then identified through Hough Transform. The experimental results confirmed that the center and object of the indicator needle could be identified in images of noisy analog gauges. The findings suggest that the image processing method applied in this study can be utilized for shape identification in analog gauges installed on ships. This study is expected to be applicable as an image processing method for the automatic remote survey of MASS."
탈중앙화 자율조직(DAO)과 대리문제에 관한 연구 -회사법적 관점에 기초하여-,2023,"['Decentralized Autonomous Organizations(DAOs)', 'Agency Problem', 'Agency Cost', 'Governance', 'Blockchain', 'Smart Contract', '탈중앙화 자율조직(DAO)', '대리문제', '대리비용', '지배구조', '블록체인', '스마트계약']","DAO는 블록체인기술을 조직체의 결성 수단으로 활용한 결과물로, 그 구성과 운영에 관하여 회사법적 관점에서 검토할 수 있다. DAO는 블록체인기술에 더하여 스마트계약을 기술적으로 구현할 수 있게 되면서 등장할 수 있었다. DAO가 주식회사와 같은 일반적인 기업조직과 구별되는 가장 큰 특징은 중앙집중화된 경영기구 없이 조직을 운영하는 것을 기본 이념으로 삼는다는 것이다. 이러한 탈중앙화의 이념은 DAO의 지배구조체계를 설정하는 중요한 요소인데 이를 기업의 일반적인 지배구조 개념에 대입하면, DAO의 지배구조는 ‘단체 운영에 관한 결정권이 이사회와 같은 일부 경영진이 아닌 전체 구성원들에게 분산되어 있어 구성원들의 의사에 따라 운영될 수 있는 구조’를 의미하는 것으로 설명할 수 있다. 대리문제는 일반적으로 본인인 일방 당사자의 편익이 대리인으로 불리는 다른 당사자의 행위에 달려있는 경우에 발생한다. 일방의 당사자가 다른 당사자를 위하여 어떠한 업무를 처리하는 법률관계는 대부분 잠재적으로 대리문제를 포함하고 있다. DAO를 법적 조직체인 기업의 형태로 인정하려는 주된 논거 중의 하나가 대리비용이 없거나 매우 적게 발생하여 대리문제를 극복할 수 있다는 점이었다. 그러나 DAO의 이상을 현실에서 온전하게 실현하는 것은 사실상 불가능하다. DAO를 실제로 조직하고 운영을 하는 과정에서 그 업무집행사원 또는 사원 아닌 대리인이 DAO를 위하여 행위할 필요가 있다. 이러한 결과는 DAO에게도 기존의 대리문제에서와 같은 내용의 대리비용이 발생할 수 있다는 것을 보여주는 것이기도 하다. 회사의 경우 일반적으로 ① 회사의 소유자와 그가 채용한 경영자 사이의 이익충돌에 관한 것, ② 과반수나 지배적 지분을 가진 소유자 쪽과 소수주주나 일반 주주 쪽 사이의 이익충돌에 관한 것, ③ 회사 자체와 채권자, 근로자, 소비자와 같은 회사가 거래하는 상대방 사이의 이익충돌에 관한 것 등을 들 수 있다. DAO가 현재의 기업과 같은 역할을 하기 위하여 탄생한 배경을 생각하면, 그 대리문제 역시 회사의 그것과 비슷한 모습으로 발생할 가능성이 높다. 그러므로 회사의 대리문제 유형을 기초로 DAO 대리문제의 유형을 비교·검토할 필요가 있다. 그러나 대리문제의 발생가능성이 있다는 것만으로 DAO의 효용성이 없어졌다고 평가하는 것은 이르다. DAO의 의사결정 과정을 살펴보면, 기존의 기업형태와 비교하여 그 사원들이 DAO의 의사결정에 직접 참여할 수 있는 가능성이 더 큰데, 만약 이러한 가능성의 상당부분을 현실에서 실현할 수 있다면 DAO의 대리비용을 기존의 기업에 비하여 상당한 정도로 줄일 수 있다. DAO는 기존의 기업형태를 대체하는 것이 아닌 추가 또는 보완재로서의 역할을 수행한다고 보는 것이 합리적이다. DAO를 조직법적으로 수용함에 있어 그 이상적인 목표를 현실의 법에서 실현하는 것은 매우 어렵다. 오히려 그 한계를 인정하고 이를 보완하면서 현실의 법에 맞게 변형하는 것이 효율적인 수용의 작업일 것이다. 이를 위해서는 DAO의 한계를 확인하여야 하는데, 이 논문을 통하여 그 한계인 대리문제의 발생가능성을 검토하였고, 부족하게나마 그 개선방안을 함께 살펴보았다.","Recognizing DAOs as legal entities is motivated by their ability to mitigate the agency problems, minimizing or eliminating associated costs. Examining the decision-making processes of DAOs reveals a unique advantage – greater direct member participation compared to conventional corporate structures. If realized, this participation can substantially reduce agency costs for DAOs, differentiating them from traditional corporations. However, translating the ideals of DAOs into practical reality poses significant challenges. In the actual organization and operation of a DAO, members or agents must represent its interests, introducing the possibility of agency costs similar to traditional models. It becomes essential to assess and analyze DAO agency problems in parallel with those of traditional companies. This paper identifies the agency problems as a notable limitation of DAOs and explores potential methods for improvement. The key lies in recognizing and addressing these limitations, thereby transforming DAOs to harmonize with established legal norms."

Specifically, it is intended to investigate the mediating influence of psychological empowerment as well as the moderating effect of power distance orientation in the link between transformational leadership and voice behavior. In particular, considering the importance of vertical relationships in military organizations, the direct superior's leadership will have a greater impact on subordinates' voice behavior. The peculiarity of authoritative military organizations is that their hierarchical order is very strict compared to civilian organizations, so the mechanisms and effects on voice behavior may appear differently.The subject of this study was the non-commissioned officers and officers of the army, which is a hierarchical organization. Of the 517 samples that responded, 453 valid samples were used for analysis, excluding 64 insincere samples. Data analysis was conducted through descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and structural model verification. Through the study, the following results were derived. First, it was found that transformational leadership had a statistically significant positive effect on voice behavior. Second, it was confirmed that psychological empowerment has a mediating effect in the relationship between transformational leadership and voice behavior. Third, the influence of transformational leadership on voice behavior is moderated by power distance orientation. Fourth, power distance orientation moderates the effect of transformational leadership on psychological empowerment. Based on the results of this study, practical contents that can be suggested to HRD managers in military organizations were discussed, and limitations of the study and future research directions were presented."

Lateral Automatic Landing Control System for Cooperating to Suppress Risk and Deviations Based on MPC and NN,2023,"['Carrier-based aircraft', 'lateral deck motion compensation', 'linear matrix inequalities', 'model predictive control', 'neural network.']",,"The model predictive control (MPC) and neural network (NN) are utilized to establish an automatic carrier landing system (ACLS) guidance law in the lateral plane, which achieves the objective of eliminating the lateral landing risk and lateral state deviations, and compensating the deck motion. For this motivation, the nonlinear lateral kinetic function is transformed into a polytopic model based on the landing state deviations. The NN is used to construct the lateral deck motion compensation (DMC) so that the proposed method can track the dynamic lateral desired glide slope. The NN outputs the controlled variables, which compensate the aileron and rudder manipulations in the MPC algorithm. The previous risk model provides the current landing risk numerical value that are introduced into the MPC performance. The landing state deviations, landing risk, and deck motion is considered in the solution of several linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The input and output constraints are transformed into LMIs to maintain the feasible of the lateral actuators of the aircraft. The off-line design strategy of weight matrices is adopted to enhance the calculation speed and robust. Finally, three simulation examples are executed on a semiphysical platform based on the original nonlinear landing model, which verify the excellent multiple constraints optimization performance of the proposed method."

However, the COVID-19, which began at the end of 2019, had a significant impact on people's health, work, life and study due to its wide range and long duration, which was classified as a public health emergency at the national level. COVID-19 erupted again in the first half of 2022, and sports training institutions in dozens of cities in China were closed; in this context, the future trend of the sports training industry became more uncertain, and the industry faced great challenges. Subjects and Methods: In this paper, the methods of literature review, expert interview and empirical research were adapted to study the logic and realization path of OMO transformation in the youth sports training industry. The OMO model was implemented to optimize youth sports training institutions by constructing private traffic pool and product matrix. Results: The construction path of private domain traffic pool consisted of five steps: attraction, cultivation, screening, collection, and return. Building a product matrix could refine OMO's high-quality products, enhance their core value, provide more high-quality sports parenting content, and provide more ""experts"". Sports training products were divided into six modules from a static perspective: teaching, function, externalization, frequency, honor, and health, and a ""product matrix"" for sports training institutions was constructed; sports training products were divided into three categories from a dynamic perspective: drainage products, profit products, and image products, which are essential for an excellent product matrix. Conclusions: OMO is the future development trend of the youth sports training industry.

Development of the Site Index Curves for Quercus acuta Stands,2023,"['Chapman-Richards model', 'evergreen broad-leaved tree (EBLT)', 'site productivity', 'Quercus acuta', 'reference age']",,"Background and objective: The purpose of this study is to develop a model for estimating the site index (SI), which is thecriterion for determining the site productivity of the Quercus acuta stand as known as Evergreen broad-leaved tree (EBLT)species.Methods: The materials used in the analysis were data from 63 sample plots, and the sample plots data were collected fromthe National Forest Inventory (NFI) and other sites. Since the site index is determined by the height and stand age of thedominant trees, the Schumacher model, the Chapman-Richards model, and the Weibull model were applied to derive theoptimal equation for estimating the dominant tree height.Results: The three models derived the parameters and went through a statistical test. Among the three models, theChapman-Richards model was found to be optimal considering the fitness index, bias, and residuals. By transforming thismodel, site index estimation equations with the reference age of 30 years were created, and site index curves werederived. According to the analysis of the collected data, the site index of the Quercus acuta stand in Korea was found tobe in the range of 10 to 16.Conclusion: As the growth distribution of Quercus acuta is expected to move north due to climate change, the derivationof the site index representing site productivity will be helpful in making policy and management decisions for this species."

Especially, research on text summarization using Transformer, an artificial neural network model, has been mainly conducted. Among various studies, the GSG method, which trains a model through sentence-by-sentence masking, has received the most attention. However, the traditional GSG has limitations in selecting a sentence to be masked based on the degree of overlap of tokens, not the meaning of a sentence. Therefore, in this study, in order to improve the quality of text summarization, we propose SbGSG (Semantic-based GSG) methodology that selects sentences to be masked by GSG considering the meaning of sentences. As a result of conducting an experiment using 370,000 news articles and 21,600 summaries and reports, it was confirmed that the proposed methodology, SbGSG, showed superior performance compared to the traditional GSG in terms of ROUGE and BERT Score."
Microflame diffusion properties of AP/HTPB propellant under binder width effects,2023,['· AP/HTPB propellant · BDP model · Diffusion flame · Random particle packing'],,"The present study proposes a method to estimate the microflame properties of ammonium perchlorate/hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (AP/HTPB) propellant at different binder widths.

Impressed by the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, there is a growing concern about their potential risks. It is significant to ask whether the AI models understand because it is closely tied to how to prioritize issues. We begin with a brief overview of how the Transformer architecture, which is the basic structure of many language models, works. It is claimed that understanding is divided into distinctively linguistic and cognitive understanding, and that cognitive understanding is further divided into epistemic and semantic understanding. Building on these distinctions, we show that large language models can have linguistic understanding but fall short in cognitive understanding. In particular, we critically examine the claim by Coelo Molo and Milliere (2023) that ChatGPT can have semantic understanding, which is based on teleosemantics."

In addition, in the case of colloquial data, there are many non-grammatical data, so after learning, the model may not understand the sentence when it receives a sentence that is not a standard language as an input. Therefore, in order to solve these problems, this paper proposes an augmented method that preserves the label of sentence data, enhances data, and adds non-grammatical sentences to the original data."

글로벌 OTT 속 아시아인의 오리엔탈 스타일과 드라마 <파친코>의 트랜스 퍼시픽적 전환의 (불)가능성,2023,"['Pachinko', 'K-drama', 'Oriental style', 'Zainichi', 'Model minority narrative', 'Parallel structure', 'Aesthetics of Singularity', 'Trans-Pacific']",,"Recently, in global OTT, Asians are appearing as leading characters rather than supporting characters or being objectified. Along with this, Asian culture is being depicted in the ‘Oriental style’ (Jane Park), which depicts it naturally and stylishly rather than as something exotic or an object of contempt or fear. However, this representation often refers to Asian culture as an empty signifier, which follows its trends and which does not relate with the narrative of the drama. As an exception, going beyond simply ‘oriental style’ and breaking away from the binary opposition between K-drama and American drama, the drama Pachinko utilizes Korean drama and movie content and includes a glocal content with a universal immigrant narrative, borrowing the method of representing the Asian minority in American multiculturalism. In other words, from a positive perspective, by using the Korean Wave, the drama depicts Korea’s colonial history and Japanese racism in detail, and at the same time it is achieving universality depicting a model minority for multiculturalism. It apprently advocates a trans-Pacific transformation in that the subject matter of Zainichi is not only about issues between Korea and Japan, but also about East Asia and U.S. However, due to the absence of Zainichi Koreans of North Korean nationality etc, it is problematic that there is a lack of a multi-layered portrayal of Zainichi, which was born in a trans-Pacific situation such as colonialism, division of North and South Korea, and the U.S.-led Cold War. This point is also revealed by the improbability of the drama’s parallel structure between the present and the past. This improbability can be interpreted in the ”Aesthetics of Singularity” (Fredrick Jameson), a concept that indicates that today’s media works consist of intermittent practices that temporarily combine flashing events rather than from continuous themes, methodologies, and systems. In conclusion, this article analyzes that the drama Pachinko is taking advantage of the American glocalist media landscape that wraps ‘South Korea’s nationalistic postcolonial desire’ in the outer shell of a universal immigrant narrative. Unlike ’minor feelings’ (Kathy Park Hong), which do not use racial trauma as a dramatic device to achieve personal growth, but rather relate to the phenomenon of the trauma of a racist and capitalist system holding individuals in place, the ‘model minority’ narrative in the multiculturalism expressed is  sutured in white supremacy. Therefore, we also need to discuss about an alternative media culture that faces ‘minor feelings’ rather than model minority narrative."

With this integration and the development of intelligent attacks that can lead to a single external intrusion as a whole system paralysis, the risk and impact of security on industrial control systems are increasing. As a result, research on how to protect and detect cyber attacks is actively underway, and deep learning models in the form of unsupervised learning have achieved a lot, and many abnormal detection technologies based on deep learning are being introduced. In this study, we emphasize the application of preprocessing methodologies to enhance the anomaly detection performance of deep learning models on time series data. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of a Wavelet Transform (WT)-based noise reduction methodology as a preprocessing technique for deep learning-based anomaly detection. Particularly, by incorporating sensor characteristics through clustering, the differential application of the Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform proves to be the most effective approach in improving the detection performance of cyber attacks."

By modeling the process of cremation, and confirm where the current human bone data corresponds to, thereby identifying one aspect of the funeral process. First, by examining the characteristics of the cremated human bones, it was confirmed that the cremated human remains of Seokchon-dong were cremated before skeletonization, and the possibility of deliberate fragmentation of the cremated bones was low. Next, by modeling the process of secondary cremation, it was assumed that three types of archaeological features were predicted: ‘the burial’, ‘the crematory feature’ and the ‘disposal area of cremation remnants’, and it was also predicted that cremated remains would be excavated in a characteristic pattern from each of form of the features. the cremated bones excavated from the vicinity of ancient Tomb No. 3 in 1986, and vicinity of ancient Tomb No. 1 in 2010s were evaluated by AAI(anatomical accuracy index) and ADI(anatomical diversity index), substituting them into the model, it was found that the former was highly likely to correspond to ‘the crematory feature’ and the latter to be ‘the disposal area of cremation remnants’. According to this, ‘the burial’ related to cremation in the Seokchon-dong ancient tombs has not yet been investigated, and in ‘the disposal area of cremation remnants’, part of cremated bones were not conceptually treated as the body of the deceased. It shows that the concept of the body is ‘transformed’ through the cremation. However, this analysis is based on the premise of the classical concept of ‘secondary cremation’, and the possibility that a mortuary practice outside of this category should also be considered."

The global space of the Internet, the main arena for digital activity, is no longer a collection of individuals free from any power. On the Internet, state seeks to exercise power through various attempts at regulation within their territories, and so-called BigTech companies, which occupy the main roads of Internet activity, also exercise private power as economic and technological powers. The relationship between the state and the market in the digital transformation must also be seen in the context of the state’s ability to protect citizens or consumers in the context of the global market. In particular, the function of regulatory law should be checked against the economic interests surrounding the digital transformation, keeping in mind that the digital transformation, which brings an expansion of freedom to individuals through innovation, can also lead to the perversion of freedom through the public and private power.Examples of actual legislative regulation of the digital economy have been of a promotional nature. Attempts to actively regulate online platforms and artificial intelligence through law are controversial. While there has been partial regulatory strengthening of large digital economy companies through amendments to the Telecommunications Business Act, the Information and Communication Network Act, and the Personal Information Protection Act, there is a general trend in society to prioritize a self-regulatory model for regulatory legislation on the digital economy.Nevertheless, the Korea Communications Commission, the Korea Fair Trade Commission, and the Korea Personal Information Protection Commission are actively enforcing laws. It is not a negative thing that the state’s regulatory function is activated while the state’s control is weakened by the expansion of economic freedom, but if the regulation does not guarantee evidence-based rationality, it may become overregulation  and lead to regulatory failure, so it is necessary to operate a smarter regulatory method. In a globalized world economy, the legal system should be developed to find a balance between public interest and private interest in the tense relationship between state power and economic power."

Furthermore, we reviewed the limitations of Cuban-style sustainable development and examined the conditions for the Cuban-style sustainable economic development model to be compatible with the SDGs, the dominant development paradigm in the international community. Since 1990, Cuba has made efforts to transform its development model and establish a sustainable development model in order to break away from external dependence in its economic structure and at the same time actively respond to changes in the global economy. The Cuban government established the 'Cuban National Strategic Plan 2030 (PNDES 2030)' for sustainable development goals centered on six strategic axes, with 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the mainstream paradigm, in each strategic axis. Detailed items were placed. These strategic axes were planned to coexist with the 17 sub-goals of the SDGs without significantly departing from the post-revolutionary socialist development perspective. However, in reality, the U.S. economic sanctions that have continued since the revolution are acting as an obstacle to PNDES 2030, which can be considered a Cuban-style sustainable development model, achieving certain economic results. Additionally, overcoming the inefficiencies and low productivity that occur within the framework of a planned economy can also be said to be an important condition for realizing sustainable development in Cuba."
A Novel Design of Permanent Magnet Linear Synchronous Motor with Reduced End Effect,2023,"['Electromagnetic Field', 'End Effect', 'Linear Motor', 'Modular Structure', 'Subdomain Model']",,"In response to the end effect of the permanent magnet linear synchronous motor, this paper proposes an improved modular motor structure. To compute its electromagnetic characteristics, a subdomain model that converts the Cartesian coordinate system into a polar coordinate system through coordinate transformation is further formulated, thus significantly reducing programming difficulty. The analytical results are compared with those of the finite element method and indicate that the subdomain model can accurately consider the effects of end and flux barriers. Moreover, the magnetic field distribution inside the motor is applied to explain the end force abatement, and the suggested flux barrier width is obtained. Finally, the modular structure is applied to a 9-slot, 10-pole permanent magnet linear synchronous motor. The simulation results show that the modular structure can effectively suppress the end effect of the linear motor, and the proposed subdomain model applies to the design of the modular motor."

Finally, the final version of the convergence curriculum was derived based on the contents of consultation between the researchers.Results To this end, As a result of the study, a CDPP evaluation model was proposed that transformed the existing decision making evaluation model(CIPP) as the deliberation of those involved in convergence education was an important factor for evaluating the convergence curriculum. Also, according to the CDPP evaluation model, 4 large areas, 10 medium areas, 25 small areas, and 63 detailed evaluation indicators were developed.Conclusions In order to systematize the university convergence curriculum, ‘deliberation’ of those involved in planning and designing the convergence curriculum is essential. In addition, there is a need for ‘administrative and financial support’ for students to organize and operate the convergence curriculum and a ‘performance management’ system to help systematize the convergence curriculum."
Investigation of thermal hydraulic behavior of the High Temperature Test Facility's lower plenum via large eddy simulation,2023,"['CFD', 'VHTR', 'Jet mixing', 'Vortex core visualization', 'HTGR']",,"A high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was performed using the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model for the lower plenum of the HigheTemperature Test Facility (HTTF), a ¼ scale test facility of the modular high temperature gas-cooled reactor (MHTGR) managed by Oregon State University.In most nextegeneration nuclear reactors, thermal stress due to thermal striping is one of the risks to be curiously considered. This is also true for HTGRs, especially since the exhaust helium gas temperature is high. In order to evaluate these risks and performance, organizations in the United States led by the OECD NEA are conducting a thermal hydraulic code benchmark for HTGR, and the test facility used for this benchmark is HTTF. HTTF can perform experiments in both normal and accident situations and provide high-quality experimental data. However, it is difficult to provide sufficient data for benchmarking through experiments, and there is a problem with the reliability of CFD analysis results based on Reynoldseaveraged NaviereStokes to analyze thermal hydraulic behavior without verification.To solve this problem, high-fidelity 3-D CFD analysis was performed using the LES model for HTTF. It was also verified that the LES model can properly simulate this jet mixing phenomenon via a unit cell test that provides experimental information. As a result of CFD analysis, the lower the dependency of the subgrid scale model, the closer to the actual analysis result. In the case of unit cell test CFD analysis and HTTF CFD analysis, the volume-averaged sub-grid scale model dependency was calculated to be 13.0% and 9.16%, respectively. As a result of HTTF analysis, quantitative data of the fluid inside the HTTF lower plenum was provided in this paper. As a result of qualitative analysis, the temperature was highest at the center of the lower plenum, while the temperature fluctuation was highest near the edge of the lower plenum wall. The power spectral density of temperature was analyzed via fast Fourier transform (FFT) for specific points on the center and side of the lower plenum. FFT results did not reveal specific frequencydominant temperature fluctuations in the center part. It was confirmed that the temperature power spectral density (PSD) at the top increased from the center to the wake. The vortex was visualized using the well-known scalar Q-criterion, and as a result, the closer to the outlet duct, the greater the influence of the mainstream, so that the inflow jet vortex was dissipated and mixed at the top of the lower plenum.Additionally, FFT analysis was performed on the support structure near the corner of the lower plenum with large temperature fluctuations, and as a result, it was confirmed that the temperature fluctuation of the flow did not have a significant effect near the corner wall. In addition, the vortices generated from the lower plenum to the outlet duct were identified in this paper. It is considered that the quantitative and qualitative results presented in this paper will serve as reference data for the benchmark."

Among those accidents, ship collision accidents have been up to 1,275 cases. But in the accidents relating to small ships like a fishing vessel, analyzing the causes of the accidents would depend on statements of the persons related because there is often no navigational data. But those statements can be incorrect and give rise to disagreements between them so that it causes conflicts with each other during the trial. So a replay system of ship collision accident (RESCA) has been developed in order to reproduce the ship collision accident by using AIS, V-PASS or radar data. But the reproduced trajectory of ship collision accident is needed to be verified because it can be unreasonable physically. So a method to verify the reproduced trajectory and collect the physical data on ship collision accident is newly designed by using free running test. In the RESCA, the accident is reproduced using the navigational data from the trajectory for a ship and measured from free running model test for the other ship at the same time. Through free running test, the behavior of the model ship is transformed from model scale into real scale. In order to check into the accuracy of the new method, free running model tests by using RESCA are carried out on the actual ship collision accidents."

However, the landscape is rapidly transforming owing to the proliferation of personalized conversational artificial intelligence (AI) services and the discernible shift in trends related to interior consumption diversification, particularly in the aftermath of the pandemic. This shift has led to a notable increase in the demand for online services. This study aims to respond to these emerging needs by investigating the potential implementation of a conversational AI chatbot for design consulting in the interior fabric sector, emphasizing the provision of tailored services based on user types. The primary objectives encompass the development of service scenarios and the design of flowcharts for interactive AI chatbots. (Method) A dual approach involving literature review and user experience research methodologies was employed. Thirty-two consultants were interviewed to elicit valuable insights into consulting services, and surveys were administered to service users to comprehensively analyze and categorize their preferences. (Results) Through the meticulous alignment of consultant and user types with the intricacies of the consulting process, three distinct user scenarios for chatbot service design were derived. Subsequently, based on these scenarios, Interactive AI chatbot scenario IA flowcharts were developed to illustrate dynamic interactions and decision points within the chatbot service. (Conclusion) Based on the consultant’s career level and the user’s purchasing tendency, consultants were divided into beginner, intermediate, and leader levels, whereas users were divided into leader, cooperative, and indecision types; thus, six personas were developed. This study, cognizant of the evolving landscape in the online transformation of interior fabric consulting, introduces a service model that integrates conversational AI chatbot services with established design consulting practices. This model aims to provide personalized services that cater to the individual needs of users. Moreover, this study delves into the potential limitations that may arise in the online transition of interior consulting services. It also suggests possibilities for the convergence of online and offline services, considering the unique spatial characteristics inherent in the field of interior design. Consequently, this study not only contributes to meeting the current demands of users but also anticipates future trends at the intersection of technology and design consulting within the interior design domain. The proposed model underscores the adaptability and integration of AI technologies in addressing the evolving needs of users in the home furnishing and interior design sectors."
Localization of lung abnormalities on chest X-rays using self-supervised equivariant attention,2023,"['Self-supervised equivariant attention', 'ResNet50', 'Siamese network', 'Weak supervision', 'Pixel correlation module', 'Self-attention', 'CAM']",,"Chest X-Ray (CXR) images provide most anatomical details and the abnormalities on a 2D plane. Therefore, a 2D view of the 3D anatomy is sometimes sufficient for the initial diagnosis. However, close to fourteen commonly occurring diseases are sometimes difficult to identify by visually inspecting the images. Therefore, there is a drift toward developing computer-aided assistive systems to help radiologists. This paper proposes a deep learning model for the classification and localization of chest diseases by using image-level annotations. The model consists of a modified Resnet50 backbone for extracting feature corpus from the images, a classifier, and a pixel correlation module (PCM). During PCM training, the network is a weight-shared siamese architecture where the first branch applies the affine transform to the image before feeding to the network, while the second applies the same transform to the network output. The method was evaluated on CXR from the clinical center in the ratio of 70:20 for training and testing. The model was developed and tested using the cloud computing platform Google Colaboratory (NVidia Tesla P100 GPU, 16 GB of RAM). A radiologist subjectively validated the results. Our model trained with the configurations mentioned in this paper outperformed benchmark results."
Applying Pix2pix to Translate Hyperemia in Blood Pool Image into Corresponding Increased Bone Uptake in Delayed Image in Three-Phase Bone Scintigraphy,2023,['Bone scintigraphy · Arthritis · Complex regional pain syndrome · Artificial intelligence · Image-to-image translation'],,"Purpose Delayed images may not be acquired due to severe pain, drowsiness, or worsening vital signs while waiting afterblood pool imaging in three-phase bone scintigraphy. If the hyperemia in the blood pool image contains information fromwhich increased uptake on the delayed images can be inferred, the generative adversarial network (GAN) can generate theincreased uptake from the hyperemia. We attempted to apply pix2pix, a type of conditional GAN, to transform hyperemiainto increased bone uptake.Methods We enrolled 1464 patients who underwent three-phase bone scintigraphy for inflammatory arthritis, osteomyelitis,complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), cellulitis, and recent bone injury. Blood pool images were acquired 10 minafter intravenous injection of Tc-99 m hydroxymethylene diphosphonate, and delayed bone images were obtained after 3 h.The model was based on the open-source code of the pix2pix model with perceptual loss. Increased uptake in the delayedimages generated by the model was evaluated using lesion-based analysis by a nuclear radiologist in areas consistent withhyperemia in the blood pool images.Results The model showed sensitivities of 77.8% and 87.5% for inflammatory arthritis and CRPS, respectively. In osteomyelitisand cellulitis, their sensitivities of about 44% were observed. However, in cases of recent bone injury, the sensitivitywas only 6.3% in areas consistent with focal hyperemia.Conclusion The model based on pix2pix generated increased uptake in delayed images matching the hyperemia in the bloodpool image in inflammatory arthritis and CRPS."

The purpose of this study is to develop a compact healthcare system that extracts features from ECG signals. Therefore, the performance of the Tompkins algorithm, which is widely known as a signal-based feature detection algorithm, and the deep learning model of prior research are compared. In addition, by verifying the performance of the deep learning model by applying the Haar wavelet transform to the preprocessing, we determine the optimal feature detection model applicable to the healthcare system in terms of speed and accuracy. All algorithms and models were developed using Matlab on Window, and performance was compared on Jetson nano and Raspberry pi embedded boards. As a result, the best model in terms of speed and accuracy is the Haar wavelet bidirectional long short-term memory model, which quickly performs classification prediction with almost 97% accuracy. The advantage of this study is that it quickly performs classification prediction with high accuracy compared to existing healthcare systems that use algorithms that cause signal distortion. Therefore, cardiovascular diseases can be predicted and monitored based on the feature regions detected in this study. The data used are the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the Normal Sinus Rhythm Database. If additional patient data are established and verified in the future, it will be possible to use them not only in real life but also in clinical settings."
Ventricle tracking in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) images during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) using deep learning and monogenic filtering,2023,"['Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)', 'Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)', 'Ejection fraction (EF)', 'Deep learning (DL)']",,"High-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the most important factor in promoting resuscitation outcomes; therefore,monitoring the quality of CPR is strongly recommended in current CPR guidelines. Recently, transesophageal echocardiography(TEE) has been proposed as a potential real-time feedback modality because physicians can obtain clearechocardiographic images without interfering with CPR. The quality of CPR would be optimized if the myocardial ejectionfraction (EF) could be calculated in real-time during CPR. We conducted a study to derive a protocol to detect systole anddiastole automatically and calculate EF using TEE images acquired from patients with cardiac arrest. The data were supplementedusing thin-plate spline transformation to solve the problem of insufficient data. The deep learning model wasconstructed based on ResUNet + + , and a monogenic filtering method was applied to clarify the ventricular boundary. Theperformance of the model to which the monogenic filter was added and the existing model was compared. The left ventriclewas segmented in the ME LAX view, and the left and right ventricles were segmented in the ME four-chamber view. Inmost of the results, the performance of the model to which the monogenic filter was added was high, and the difference wasvery small in some cases; but the performance of the existing model was high. Through this learned model, the effect ofCPR can be quantitatively analyzed by segmenting the ventricle and quantitatively analyzing the degree of contraction ofthe ventricle during systole and diastole."

This is creating a crisis while giving opportu1)nities to the financial industry by affecting the existing banking industry. On the other hand, as high interest rates and economic recession continue, the delinquency rate of the mutual financial sector has risen, raising concerns about bank runs due to insolvency. In such a difficult environment, it is very necessary to find ways for credit unions to enhance their competitiveness as local finance and to achieve sustainable growth. The purpose of this study is to measure meta-technology efficiency and meta-profit efficiency using data from credit businesses for 2012-2021(10 years), and to identify detailed factors that lead the profit technology gap by decomposing profit efficiency into four factors. From the perspective of the theoretical model of this study, it differs from previous studies in that it measures technology efficiency and meta-technology efficiency using parametric hyperbolic distance functions to derive technology gaps, and defines and decomposes profits into four inner factors by measuring profit efficiency and meta-profit efficiency, respectively.According to the empirical results, first, it was found that Suhyup leads the meta-frontier in meta-technology efficiency. Second, due to the large difference in efficiency between the combination of the Credit Union and the Suhyup, the average of the meta-profit efficiency was close to zero, and the Suhyup was found to lead the meta-frontier. Third, as a result of the decomposition of meta-profit efficiency, it was found that the Credit Union cooperative needs to improve technology transformation (TT), and the Suhyup needs to improve allocation transformation (AT).Based on the empirical results, in a difficult financial environment, credit unions and Suhyup are products that meet the purpose of establishing low-income finance in order to sustain growth in competition with other finances, and sustain growth to regional finance, the original purpose of low-income finance, is necessary. In addition, it will be necessary to balance asset management by improving the concentration of loan assets and to diversify the profit structure by increasing non-interest income. This suggests that the Korea Credit Cooperative Federation, fintech companies, and individual unions should jointly create new alternative models and develop asset management products due to the increase in the elderly, thereby reducing costs and improving profits."

In this study, a seismic limit state test considering different response spectra types was executed for battery chargers with and without reinforcement, which is a similar model to that using N.P.P. Battery charger using N.P.P. includes a massive transformer, which is normally fixed to the enclosure with brackets. Brackets should be under high seismic loads because of the transformer mass. Failure modes of the battery charger considered in this study were observed as the structural failure mode in transformer supports (bracket) and functional failure mode in major relay chattering. It seems that the reinforcement for structural failure mode can improve not only structural limit state but also reduce the chattering phenomenon under seismic conditions."

Unbalanced load current on the grid side and rising ground potential in a PV system are estimated to be major causes of fires in an ESS. The unbalanced load current on the grid-connected transformer side and rising DC ground potential caused by a large-scale PV system can influence the magnetizing current in the transformer, and the ESS can be adversely affected by unintentional saturation of the iron core, which may increase the possibility of a ferro-resonance phenomenon. Therefore, this paper presents a mechanism of a ferro-resonance phenomenon by using graphical solutions based on the analysis of ferro-resonance effects by the capacitance of a PCS (power conditioning system) filter. We propose an operation algorithm to prevent a ferro-resonance phenomenon by using an appropriate PCS filter and MOV (metal oxide varistor) based on the graphical solutions and the deterioration and environment conditions. Furthermore, we performed modeling of a ferro-resonance mechanism using PSCAD/EMTDC, which is composed of a distribution system, PV system, and ESS. From the simulation results based on the proposed ferro-resonance mechanism and modeling, it was confirmed that high ferro-resonance voltage up to 2.9 pu can seriously influence the battery system due to saturation of the iron core in the transformer caused by unbalanced load current and rising DC ground potential. The proposed operation algorithm to prevent ferro-resonance could contribute to stable operation of an ESS by installing optimal capacity of a PCS filter and MOV."

The lesson from this paper is that it is desirable to pursue digital government policies with strong leadership in the early days of the presidential term.In line with the global trend of transition from e-government to digital government, the Yoon Seok-yeol government is promoting a digital platform government. This digital platform government is an evolved model of digital government and at the same time represents a shift in a new state administration paradigm that focuses on strengthening the role and function of the government as a platform.The process of converting e-government, which emerged as a means of government innovation using information technology, to digital government was examined, focusing on examples of the governance systems of past governments in Korea. And through these, the success factors of the digital platform government policy of the Yoon Seok-yeol government that is currently in progress were derived.For the success of digital platform government, it is important to first establish a information system, and it is necessary to form a strong governance system to support it, and most importantly, the transfer of leadership from the president is essential."

On days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28, the expressions of smad7 and smad3 in flexor tendon tissues were detected by RT-qPCR and western blot. Furthermore, postoperative intraperitoneal injections of SMAD7 agonists or SMAD3 antagonists were given. The degree of tendon healing was evaluated by adhesion testing and biomechanical experiments. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was used to observe the pathological changes. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the expressions of collagen III, SMAD3, and SMAD7. The mRNA levels of matrix metalloproteinases, Mmp2 and Mmp9, and scleraxis (SCX) in flexor tendon tissue were detected by RT-qPCR. Smad3 expression increased and Smad7 expression decreased in flexor tendon tissue after injury. In addition, the SMAD7 agonist blocked SMAD3 phosphorylation.

The consideration related to this will be largely carried out in two stages.First, Chapter 2 examines the characteristics of the transition of literacy according to the development of digital technology, leaning on Giorgio Agamben's narrative theory. Despite the difference between the printed text and the composite text in this process, ultimately, it will be confirmed that the semanticization process of the text is the essence of literacy formation. Next, in Chapter 3, the direction of reorganization of liberal arts Korean to cope with the crisis of university education is divided into three aspects: theme, composition, and activity. This includes reflection on 'I' and reasons connecting 'community', sensory contact between learners using mobile platforms, and organic grafting of text and compound text. Through these changes, we intend to avoid the printed text centrality of the existing common curriculum and implement a learner-friendly education model centered on media literacy that combines complex style text.In this way, the media literacy grafted curriculum that strengthened learners' autonomy can be used as an alternative to convergence lectures that apply a new network of meanings surrounding the conversion of literacy to the university liberal arts curriculum."

As an alternative to overcoming the crisis, the transformation from industrial civilization to ecological civilization, analyzed as the main cause of the ecological crisis is mainly dealt with in academia and media circles. However, discussions on civilization transformation are not very active in the social science community, especially mainstream sociology (or standard sociology). In this situation, Kim Kyong-dong, who represents academic sociology in Korea, continues to publish research results on the theme of ‘civilization.’ Only a few people still pay attention to his theory of civilization. Mainstream sociology does not pay much attention to his theory of civilization and the transformation of civilization, perhaps because it is based on Eastern thought, specifically the Yin-Yang dialectics. This study summarized the reasons for the need for a civilization shift from a sociological perspective and outlined the four elements (values) he organized in the paradigm of the new civilization. The four values of the new civilization Paradigm, publicness, humanism, community, and ecologicalism, are based on the fact that people are in relationships. Kim Kyong-dong’s new civilization paradigm partly contains hope and a vision for the future. The “Advanced Society Purified by Cultural Culture,” which he presented in several books as a future society, boldly broke away from Western modernity’s framework and defined a new vision from the perspective of civilization theory. In addition, the “Advanced Society Purified by Cultural Culture” consists of six virtues based on Oriental thought, “Moderating Humanity, Rightness, Courtesy, Beuty, Wisdom and Trust” and cosmological ecology. As mentioned in the early days of this study, the purpose of this study is to examine whether Kim Kyong-dong’s new civilization Paradigm is based on global-level empathy for values and horizons that can transcend the current civilization paradigm and whether it can play a function and role as an ecological civilization. Suppose you acknowledge that there are many limitations and answer roughly. In that case, it is expected that the new civilization Paradigm will be able to play a role and function as an ecological civilization. The four social values and six virtues he presented could help establish various practical strategies as models of ecological civilization. However, it isn’t easy to analyze whether the new civilization paradigm completely transcends the modern industrial civilization paradigm. As we can see from the community analysis, some of the elements still exist in the existing paradigm."

While the first and second industrial revolutions accelerated the automation of physical labor, the Fourth Industrial Revolution, represented by data-driven artificial intelligence, is revolutionizing cognitive labor automation in all industries. Initially, the goal of artificial intelligence was to implement systems that could make judgments like humans by transferring the knowledge accumulated by humans to computers. However, it has now evolved into data-driven artificial intelligence technologies such as machine learning and deep learning, enabling machines to develop capabilities similar to human abstract thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills, which were previously difficult to implement. Data-driven artificial intelligence will evolve in the future to compete or collaborate with humans in various fields. On the one hand, there is concern about artificial intelligence threatening our jobs, while on the other hand, we encounter chatbots or chat-based AI systems in our daily lives. Artificial intelligence is being integrated into processes in a variety of sectors such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, distribution, transportation, and electronics, becoming an integral part of our daily lives.In the future, there is a high possibility that personal proficiency and competence in digital technologies, particularly in handling artificial intelligence, will create social, cultural, and economic disparities. To adapt to such changes and promote human progress, it is crucial for humans and computers (artificial intelligence, robots) to move towards collaboration and coexistence, rather than confrontation and competition. By leveraging the strengths of both humans and artificial intelligence, we can achieve more effective and efficient outcomes. Humans can contribute their cognitive abilities, creativity, emotional intelligence, and ethical considerations, while AI can provide data analysis, pattern recognition, automation, and optimization capabilities. By designing collaborative models that effectively integrate human and AI capabilities, we can maximize the potential of both and create a synergistic relationship."

Transfer Learning based Parameterized 3D Mesh Deformation with 2D Stylized Cartoon Character,2023,"['3D Modeling', 'Mesh Deformation', 'Computing methodologies', '3D Stylized Avatar', 'Metaverse Applications']",,"As interest in the metaverse has grown, there has been a demand for avatars that can represent individual users. Consequently, research has been conducted to reduce the time and cost required for the current 3D human modeling process. However, the recent automatic generation of 3D humans has been focused on creating avatars with a realistic human form. Furthermore, the existing methods have limitations in generating avatars with imbalanced or unrealistic body shapes, and their utilization is limited due to the absence of datasets. Therefore, this paper proposes a new framework for automatically transforming and creating stylized 3D avatars. Our research presents a definitional approach and methodology for creating non-realistic character avatars, in contrast to previous studies that focused on creating realistic humans. We define a new shape representation parameter and use a deep learning–based method to extract character body information and perform automatic template mesh transformation, thereby obtaining non-realistic or unbalanced human meshes. We present the resulting outputs visually, conducting user evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our approach provides an automatic mesh transformation method tailored to the growing demand for avatars of various body types and extends the existing method to the 3D cartoon stylized avatar domain."

Is ChatGPT a “Fire of Prometheus” for Non-Native English-Speaking Researchers in Academic Writing?,2023,"['Large language model', 'ChatGPT', 'Generative pretrained transformer', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Academic writing', 'Publication', 'Editing']",,"Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have garnered considerable interest for their potential to aid non-native English-speaking researchers. These models can function as personal, round-the-clock English tutors, akin to how Prometheus in Greek mythology bestowed fire upon humans for their advancement. LLMs can be particularly helpful for non-native researchers in writing the Introduction and Discussion sections of manuscripts, where they often encounter challenges. However, using LLMs to generate text for research manuscripts entails concerns such as hallucination, plagiarism, and privacy issues; to mitigate these risks, authors should verify the accuracy of generated content, employ text similarity detectors, and avoid inputting sensitive information into their prompts. Consequently, it may be more prudent to utilize LLMs for editing and refining text rather than generating large portions of text. Journal policies concerning the use of LLMs vary, but transparency in disclosing artificial intelligence tool usage is emphasized. This paper aims to summarize how LLMs can lower the barrier to academic writing in English, enabling researchers to concentrate on domain-specific research, provided they are used responsibly and cautiously."

Postema']","이른바 제정법 만능주의 시대에 관습법의 존재, 의의, 역할 및 사회적 기능에 대한 부정적인 인식과 평가가 학계나 법실무에 팽배해있다. 법철학사적으로 보면, 특히 고전적 법실증주의자인 벤담(Jeremy Bentham)과 이후 명령주의적 실증주의 진영에서는 관습법의 독자적인 법원성을 부정하기도 한다. 또한 실정법학이나 법실무에서는 여전히 불문 형태로 남아있는 고유한 의미에서의 관습법은 오늘날 존재 의의나 가치, 효용이 없다는 비판과 함께 일종의 ‘관습법 무용론’의 입장을 보인다. 하지만 관습 혹은 관습법을 둘러싼 이러한 다양한 차원에서의 ‘관습법 회의론’들이 과연 타당한 것인지에 대한 근본적인 재고와 평가가 필요하다. 특히 벤담 이후의 회의론적 전통 안에서 관습법 문제에 대한 해법으로 제시된, 관습을 입법이나 사법적 창구를 통해 합법화 - ‘입법에 의한 관습법제화’와 ‘사법에 의한 관습법제화’ - 하려는 이른바 분석적 환원주의는 관습의 고유성을 몰각할 뿐만 아니라 또 다른 문제점과 부작용을 야기한다는 점도 숙고할 필요가 있다. 결론적으로 필자는 관습법을 둘러싼 각종의 회의론들의 근저에는 관습의 본질에 대한 불충분한 이해(‘관습 그 자체’ 차원)와 관습법의 성립 요건에 대한 부적절한 이분법이 전제되어 있음(‘관습법 이론’ 차원)을 규명한다. 이는 결국 관습법에 대한 오해와 부당한 평가로 이어질 뿐만 아니라 미래지향적 관점에서도 바람직하지 못하다. 한걸음 더 나아가, 오늘날 다차원적인 규범다원주의 시대에 법의 한계와 입법 공백을 보완할 수 있는 유용한 법적 자원이자 법원(法源)으로서의 법적 관습에 대한 건설적인 재조명이 필요하다고 역설한다. 필자는 이러한 기획을 ‘관습법의 현대화’ 혹은 ‘관습법의 현대적 변용’이라 부르고, 이 목표를 구현하기 위한 이론적 대안을 제시하고자 한다. 대안 이론은 관습의 본질에 대한 철학적 탐구를 기초로 ‘담론적인 규범적 실천으로서 관습’을 재규정하고, 기존의 ‘관습에 대한 부가적 개념관’에서 ‘통합적 관습관’으로의 전환을 제안한다. 그 토대가 되는 이론적 자원으로 풀러(Lon L. Fuller)의 소통적 법이론과 포스테마(Gerald J. Postema)의 규범적 실천 설명법을 중요한 두 축으로 삼는다. 마지막으로 필자는 ① ‘연성법으로서 관습법’의 가치에 대한 재조명 필요성을 강조하면서, 유연성과 규범적 효능 그리고 적응력 등을 핵심 가치로 요하는 미래법모델로서의 ② ‘유형 관습법’의 도입 및 ③ ‘관습법 3.0’ 시대의 가능성과 의의를 논구한다. 이렇듯 대안 이론을 통해 재조명되고 재건된 관습법론은 각종의 관습법 회의론을 극복하고 관습 및 관습법의 본질에 대한 적실하고 개선된 이해를 제공할 뿐만 아니라 제정법과의 교호 작용을 통해 상보적으로 조화될 수 있는 미래법모델로서의 관습법의 미래적 가치 발굴에도 기여할 수 있을 것이다. 이러한 작업은 정통 법철학의 고유한 주제 탐구 영역에 머물지 않고, ‘지금 여기 법철학’을 딛고 넘어 ‘법철학적 법미래학’으로 향한 기획으로도 볼 수 있을 것이다.","Today in the ‘monopoly of legislation’ era, negative perceptions and evaluations of the existence, significance, role, and social function of customary law are prevalent in academia and in legal practice. In terms of the history of legal philosophy, Jeremy Bentham, a classical legal positivist, and the later camp of imperative positivism sometimes deny the independent legal status of customary law. In addition, legal dogmatics and legal practice display the  position of a type of ‘uselessness of unwritten customary law’ along with criticism of a lack of significance, value, or utility at present. However, it is necessary fundamentally to reconsider and evaluate whether the various types of ‘customary law skepticism’ are indeed valid. In particular, in the skeptical tradition since Bentham, what is known as analytic reductionism, which seeks to legitimize custom through legislation or judiciary - ‘legalization of customary law by legislation’ and ‘legalization of customary law by judiciary’ - is presented as a solution to the problem of customary law. However, It is necessary to consider the fact that not only does this ignore the uniqueness of custom, but it also causes other problems and side effects. In conclusion, the author argues that at the root of various types of skepticism is an insufficient understanding of the nature of custom (the level of ‘customary law itself’) and an inappropriate dichotomy of the requirements for the formation of customary law (the level of ‘customary law theory’). This not only leads to misunderstandings and unfair evaluations of customary law but is also undesirable from a future-oriented point of view. Moreover, in today’s era of multidimensional normative pluralism, it is emphasized that a constructive reexamination of legal customs is necessary as a useful legal resource and source of law that can supplement legal gaps. I call this project the ‘modernization of customary law’ or ‘transformation of customary law’ and propose a theoretical alternative to realize this goal. The alternative theory proposes a transition from the existing ‘additive conception of custom’ to the ‘integration conception of custom’ based on a philosophical inquiry into the nature of custom. Lon L. Fuller’s communicative jurisprudence and Gerald J. Postema’s normative practice analysis are taken as two important theoretical resources that form the foundation. Lastly, the author emphasizes ① a reexamination of the value of ‘customary law as soft law’ and  ② the introduction of ‘type customary law’ and then discusses the possibility and significance of ③ the ‘customary law 3.0’ era. In this way, the alternative jurisprudence of customary law overcomes various types of customary law skepticism, provides a proper and improved understanding of the nature of custom and customary law, and can be harmonized as complementary with legislative law. As a future law model, this approach will be able to contribute to discovering the future value of customary law. This work does not stay in the orthodox legal philosophy but can be seen as a plan to go beyond the ‘hic et nunc philosophy of law’ and head toward ‘jurisprudential futurology’."

Notably, product intelligence, autonomous manufacturing systems, and innovative business models are rapidly advancing, ushering in a new era of globalized data economy. Major nations such as the United States, the European Union, and China are actively engaged in geopolitical strategic competition in the field of AI, recognizing its pivotal role in future economic and military dominance. However, amid this period of paradigm shifts and turbulent changes in the global trade landscape, the World Trade Organization (WTO) is falling behind. The international community is urged to courageously confront challenges and seek solutions grounded in the principles of openness, freedom, and democratic values. This paper delves into the technological, economic, and societal transformations brought about by the proliferation of AI, considering their implications from a trade perspective. It also examines the global strategic competition and cooperation surrounding AI governance from an international relations standpoint. As priority items for future trade discussions related to AI, the following are proposed: i) an AI product and service categorization framework, ii) the promotion of interoperability based on standardized protocols to facilitate trade, iii) the reconstructed legality of AI regulations to ensure trust, and iv) the harmonization of trade rules with economic security considerations."
Study on micro-grinding mechanism and surface and subsurface quality of 20 vol% SiCp/Al composites,2023,['· Grinding mechanism · Simulation model · Surface roughness · Subsurface quality · 20 % SiCp/2009Al composites'],,"A finite element model of single abrasive grinding was established to analyze the material removal during the grinding process and analyze the surface and subsurface defects of the material after grinding.

Real-Time Power Quality Event Monitoring System Using Digital Signal Processor for Smart Metering Applications,2023,"['Advanced metering infrastructure', 'Hilbert transform', 'Fuzzy logic', 'Power quality monitoring', 'Power quality disturbance classification', 'Smart grid']",,"Due to the enormous increase of domestic and industrial loads in the smart grid infrastructure, the power quality issues are very frequent. It is essential to monitor the quality of power being supplied to customers. To identify the quality of the power effectively at various locations, a simple solution is needed that limits the usage of computing resources and can also be deployed in remote location. This paper proposes a low-computational, automatic, real-time PQ monitoring system based on the Hilbert transform (HT), fuzzy logic and threshold based classifiers. The major contribution of the proposed method is based on sample-to-sample process that can detect the events timely, unlike a ten-cycle window-based methods. Six power quality disturbances are synthetically generated using mathematical model as per the IEEE 1159–1195 standard. The methodology utilizes HT for the extraction of the instantaneous amplitude from the filtered signal. Thereby, the essential features are extracted and fed to classifier to improve the recognition capability. The robustness of the proposed algorithm is verified in a MATLAB environment with different signal-to-noise ratios. An experimental prototype has also been developed using TMS320F28379D Launchpad to validate the proposed PQ monitoring algorithm using both synthetic and real-time PQ signals. The real-time implementation demonstrates that the proposed PQ sensing hardware and PQ disturbance analysis software are effective, fast, and accurate."

This method is inefficient and has a certain threat to the life safety of detection personnel. The development of deep learning and computational vision supplies a fresh idea for detection of transmission lines. Therefore, this paper analyzes the traditional Faster R-CNN based on twin reality scene modeling technology. Then aiming at the shortcomings of traditional algorithms, the Cascade R-CNN algorithm is proposed to complete the detection of transmission lines based on twin reality system. It com-pares the accuracy and other indicators of Cascade R-CNN and Faster R-CNN algorithms. The effectiveness of two algorithms for analysis and detection of transmission lines is verified through experiments. Finally, the results indicates that the system using Cascade R-CNN has higher prediction accuracy, and has better practicability for analysis and detection of transmission lines."

We present a novel representation of shapes that decouples affine-style deformations over a submanifold and a product submanifold principally of the Grassmannian. As an analytic generative model, the separable representation, informed by a database of physically relevant airfoils, offers: (i) a rich set of novel 2D airfoil deformations not previously captured in the data, (ii) an improved low-dimensional parameter domain for inferential statistics informing design/manufacturing, and (iii) consistent 3D blade representation and perturbation over a sequence of nominal 2D shapes."

This paper compares the Korean game industry, which Google has already charged 30% commission since the early 2010s, with the Chinese game industry, where the local app store secured market dominance at the same time. During this period, mobile transformation progressed rapidly in the Chinese game industry, but mobile transformation in the Korean game industry was delayed. One of the reasons may be that Google has secured monopoly control over the app store and charged an excessive payment fee of 30%.In the text, the Chinese game industry’s mobile detour and leapfrogging strategy was explained in three aspects: online payment, online assurance, and online access gateway.Tencent has been able to grow into China’s largest gaming platform because it has so successfully pursued these three mobile transitions’ detour and leapfrogging strategies. On the other hand, the launch of the Kakao Pay mobile payment app in Korea (2014) is one years behind the launch of the Tencent WeChat Pay mobile payment app (2013), and six years behind the launch of the Alipay Pay mobile payment (2008). Kakao Talk’s mobile assurance service (2021) is nine years behind WeChat’s mobile assurance service (2012).One Store, Korea’s local app store platform, has a market share of only 10%, but in China, the local app store accounts for more than half of the market share.In the past, Korea was able to model successful game developers growing into publishers in online games. However, in mobile games, this growth is now difficult because global app store platform such as Apple and Google cut fees by as much as 30%."

With the growing importance of summarizing this text data to extract meaningful information, there has been active research on deep learning-based abstractive summarization. However, conversational data, compared to structured texts like news articles, often contains missing or transformed information, necessitating consideration from multiple perspectives due to its unique characteristics. In particular, vocabulary omissions and unrelated expressions in the conversation can hinder effective summarization. Therefore, in this study, we restructured by considering the characteristics of Korean conversational data, fine-tuning a pre-trained text summarization model based on KoBART, and improved conversation data summary perfomance through a refining operation to remove redundant elements from the summary. By restructuring the sentences based on the order of utterances and extracting a central speaker, we combined methods to restructure the conversation around them. As a result, there was about a 4 point improvement in the Rouge-1 score. This study has demonstrated the significance of our conversation restructuring approach, which considers the characteristics of dialogue, in enhancing Korean conversation summarization performance."

The model uses two A4 sheets as the base materials for ddakji. The folding process involves a series of boundary conditions that transform the wing part of the paper structure into a twisted configuration. A rigid plate boundary condition is also adopted for squeezing, establishing the shape and stress state of the game-ready ddakji through dynamic relaxation analysis. The gaming process analysis involves a forced displacement of the striking ddakji to a predetermined collision position. Collision analysis then follows at a given speed, with the objective of overturning the struck ddakji––a winning condition. A genetic algorithm-based optimization analysis identifies the optimal collision conditions that result in the overturning of the struck ddakji. For efficiency, the collision analysis is divided into two stages, with the second stage carried out only if the first stage predicts a possible overturn. The fitness function for the genetic algorithm during the first stage is the direction cosine of the struck ddakji, whereas in the second stage, it is the inverse of the speed, thus targeting the lowest overall collision speed. Consequently, this analysis provides optimal collision conditions for various compression thicknesses."

Among them, solar power is attracting attention as a representative eco-friendly energy that does not deplete and does not emit pollutants or greenhouse gases. As a result, the supplement of solar power facility is increasing all over the world. However, solar power is easily affected by the environment such as geography and weather, so accurate solar power forecast is important for stable operation and efficient management. However, it is very hard to predict the exact amount of solar power using statistical methods. In addition, the conventional prediction methods have focused on only short- or long-term prediction, which causes it to take a long time to obtain various prediction models with different prediction horizons. Therefore, this study utilizes a many-to-many structure of a recurrent neural network (RNN) to integrate short-term and long-term predictions of solar power generation. We compare various RNN-based very short- and long-term prediction methods for solar power in terms of MSE and R2 values."
Thermo-mechanical properties in bending of  a multizone nickel-titanium archwire:  A retrieval analysis,2023,"['Archwire', 'Biomaterial science', 'Nitinol', 'Transformation temperature']",,"Objective: This study aimed to compare the mechanical and thermal properties in the anterior and posterior segments of new and retrieved specimens of a commercially available multizone superelastic nickel-titanium (NiTi) archwire. Methods: The following groups of 0.016 × 0.022-inch Bioforce NiTi archwires were compared: a) anterior and b) posterior segments of new specimens and c) anterior and d) posterior segments of retrieved specimens. Six specimens were evaluated in each group, by three-point bending and bend and free recovery tests. Bending moduli (Eb) were calculated. Furthermore, the new specimens were evaluated with scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry. A multiple linear regression model with a random intercept at the wire level was applied for data analysis. Results: The forces in the posterior segments or new specimens were higher than those recorded in the anterior segments or retrieved specimens, respectively. Accordingly, Eb also varied. Higher austenite start and austenite finish (Af) temperatures were recorded in the anterior segments. No statistically significant differences were found for these temperatures between retrieved and new wires. The mean elemental composition was (weight percentage): Ni, 52.6 ± 0.5; Ti, 47.4 ± 0.5. Conclusions: The existence of multiple force zones was confirmed in new and retrieved Bioforce archwires. The retrieved archwires demonstrated lower forces during the initial stages of deactivation in three-point bending tests, compared with new specimens. The Af temperature of these archwires may lie higher than the regular intraoral temperature. Even at 2 mm deflections, the forces recorded from these archwires may lie beyond biologically safe limits."

KBS announces that it will produce a mini-series of Choi In-ho’s three bestsellers of Winter Traveler, Earthman and Whale Hunt as the Choi In-ho series. This shows that Choi In-ho’s influence, who has been working on novels and movies since the 1970s, continued in the 1990s, while showing that the media is being converted to dramas, not movies. Therefore, considering the cultural and social background and changes in the drama set, we tried to study the media conversion to dramas rather than movies. In the late 1980s, the drama format changed to a mini-series, not a daily soap opera or a one-act drama. In addition, social dramas, not interesting or melodrama, were requested, and the theme consciousness was emphasized by dramatizing works of fiction. Earthman was an interesting work along with the original work, but it is feared that the rationalization of criminal acts or abnormal heroism will be promoted. Accordingly, conversation is inserted into the Earthman, while adaptations such as characterization, transformation of character relationships, and intervention of narration are made. In other words, it can be seen that external factors other than the characteristics of the medium also play a role in the conversion of the novel into a drama."

LLM artificial intelligence provides excellent predictive power by analyzing large-scale data from industry and economy, and is used in various fields such as economy, medical care, law, politics, and military use. As human life is being transformed innovatively at a rapid pace, it is urgent to respond to strategies for the industry. The United States, which is quick to respond to this, is leading the artificial intelligence industry by encouraging the development of the corporate ecosystem and promoting active cooperation between companies and governments. And the foundation of this growth in the United States is supported by a business-friendly legal system. Companies such as Google, Apple, Meta, and Amazon, which are leading the global economy in 2023, are U.S. companies and platform companies. These companies continue to grow by using exclusive data, and at the center of the business is supported by policies to utilize personal information such as corporate and marketing strategies through opt-out system. Therefore, it is very meaningful to look at laws related to personal information that is the U.S. personal information protection law system, and it is meaningful in that it derives implications through analysis of the legal system and suggests a direction for Korea to move forward as a leading country of artificial intelligence.As of 2022, South Korea ranked sixth in the global export rankings after China, the United States, Germany, the Netherlands and Japan. However, it is time to innovate the industrial structure of export Korea, which is limited to export items among them, the data industry should establish itself as an important industry. It is necessary to prepare for future industries by paying attention to data-related service industries that are more likely to grow than specific items for gradual growth in the future. What role should personal information play in the data industry which is growing by almost 11% every year? From this point of view, for the development of artificial intelligence, it is necessary to break away from the constitutional aspect of basic rights and change the perspective of the trading nation, that is, from the perspective of national interests. The reason is that competition with these global data companies is not just industrial competition, but also spreading to competition between countries. Therefore, this paper recognizes these problems to understand artificial intelligence's training data and technology in the competitive system of artificial intelligence, finds implications for the U.S. Personal Information Protection Act, which deals with personal information from a market-based and national security perspective."

This study employs the method of examining attention maps to uncover the internal processing of BERT, specifically when dealing with garden-path sentences. The analysis focuses on BERT's utilization of linguistic cues, such as transitivity, plausibility, and the presence of a comma, and evaluates its capacity for reanalyzing misinterpretations. The results revealed that BERT exhibits human-like syntactic processing by attending to the presence of a comma, showing sensitivity to transitivity, and reanalyzing misinterpretations, despite initially lacking sensitivity to plausibility. By concentrating on attention maps, the present study provides valuable insights into the inner workings of BERT and contributes to a deeper understanding of how advanced neural language models acquire and process complex linguistic structures."

Goldsmith 사건의연방대법원 판결(이하 “대상판결”)의 주요 내용을 소개하고 그 시사점을 검토하였다.대상판결에서 연방대법원은 공정이용 제1 고려요소인 ‘이용의 목적 및 성격’의 분석에 집중하여, 변형적 목적과 상업적 성격이 각각 가부 판단이 아닌 정도의 문제라는 점과 이용을 정당화하는 사유의 고려 필요성을 Campbell 판결 등의 해석으로부터발견해 내었고, 공정이용이 문제가 된 특정한 이용의 맥락에서 개별적으로 판단되어야 함을 분명히 하였다. 이러한 대상판결의 주요 판단은 미국 공정이용 조항을 수입한 우리나라 저작권법 제35조의5의 해석⋅적용에 관해서도 크게 참고가 되지만, 대상판결을 참조함에 있어서 유의할 사항이 있다. 첫째, 대상판결은 공정이용 조항이 커먼로 방법론에 충실하게 적용되도록 설계되었고, 그 설계의도에 맞춰 해석⋅적용되고있음을 보여준다. 유사한 형식 및 내용으로 규정된 저작권법 제35조의5를 적용함에있어서도 공정이용과 관련해 일반화할 수 있는 추상적 판단기준의 정립에는 일정한한계가 있음을 인식하여야 한다. 둘째로, 대상판결에 포함된 구체적 논증을 일반화하는 것을 경계해야 한다. 저작권법 제35조의5가 문제가 된 특정 사안에서 대상판결의논리를 참고할 경우, 그 법리의 형식적 적용을 피하고 대상판결 사안의 특수성을 고려해 당면한 사안의 해결에 필요한 법리를 재구성하여 적용하는 것이 저작권법 제35 조의5의 바람직한 적용 형식이라고 하겠다.대상판결은 공정이용 분석의 복잡성 증가를 시사한다. 이는 환경 변화에 따른 유연성을 극대화하는 장점이 되는 동시에, 공정이용 해당 여부의 결론에 대한 예측가능성을 크게 저하시킬 염려를 낳는다. 미국의 공정이용 조항에 비하여 더욱 추상적이고개방적으로 규정된 우리 저작권법 제35조의5의 적용과 관련하여 이 점은 더 큰 부작용을 낳을 수 있다. 특히 일련의 복합적 단계들로 구성되는 인공지능 분야에서의 저작물 이용에 관한 저작권 침해 판단에 구조적 어려움을 증가시킬 수 있다는 점에서 한층 더 정밀한 법해석⋅적용의 필요성을 상기시킨다. 동시에 대상판결로부터 암시되는 법적안정성 저하의 문제는 인공지능 학습 등의 분야에 아울러 적용될 TDM 개별 면책규정 제정 논의에도 소정의 논거를 제공할 수 있을 것이다. 향후 대상판결의 영향이 어떻게 현실화되는지를 계속하여 주목할 필요가 여기에 있다.","Article 35-quinquies of the Korean Copyright Act, referred to as the ‘Fair Use’ provision, is a complementary general clause for limiting copyrights, and unlike other individual limiting clauses that focus on requirements, it focuses on comprehensive exceptions and factors to be considered in its analysis.

Goldsmith (“Subject Decision”), which has received the most attention, and examines its implications.SCOTUS focused on the analysis of the first fair use factor, the “the purpose and character of the use,” and found that the transformative purpose and commercial nature of the use are each a matter of degree, along with which the justification of the copying needs to be considered, and made it clear that fair use analysis must be made individually in the context of the specific use at issue. The main judgments of these cases are highly instructive for the interpretation and application of Article 35-quinquies, which was imported from the U.S. fair use provision, but there are certain points to note when referring to Subject Decision. First, this case shows that the fair use provision was designed to be applied faithfully to the common law methodology and is being interpreted and applied in accordance with its design intent. As such, when applying the Fair Use provision, which is similar in both formal and substantial aspects, it should be recog nized that there are certain limitations in establishing abstract criteria that can be generalized to fair use, especially in terms of first factor analysis. Second, cautions are to be given to generalizing the specific dicta of the Subject Decision. When referring to the logic of the Subject Decision in a particular case where fair use is at issue, the preferred manner of applying the provision should be not to follow case law formalistically, but to reconstruct the legal justification necessary to resolve the issue at hand, taking into account the specificity of the case.The Subject Decision suggests an increase in the complexity of fair use analysis. While this has the advantage of maximizing flexibility in response to changing circumstances, it also raises the concern that it will significantly reduce the predictability of Fair Use provision. This may have an even greater adverse effect in relation to the application of the provision of Korean Copyright Act, which is stated more abstract and open-ended than the U.S. fair use provision. In particular, it may increase the structural difficulties in determining copyright infringement in the field of artificial intelligence, which generally includes a series of complex steps, reminding us of the need for more precise interpretation and application of the law. At the same time, the diminished legal stability implied by the Subject Decision is expected to provide at least a partial basis for the enactment of TDM exception provision, which is related to the use in the AI learning. It is worth keeping an eye on how the impact of the Subject Decision will be realized in the future."

In this study, we compare the characteristics of each material accordingto the manufacturing method of the phantom manufactured with 3D printing technology and evaluateits usefulness. We manufactured phantoms of the same size using poly methyl meta acrylate (PMMA),acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), and Poly Lactic Acid (PLA) based on the international standardphantom of aluminum step wedge. We used SITEC’s radiation generator (DigiRAD-FPC R-1000-150) andcompared the shielding rate and line attenuation coefficient through the average after shooting 10 times.As a result, in the case of the measured dose transmitted through each phantom, it was confirmed thatthe appearance of the dose measured for phantoms decreased linearly as the thickness increased undereach condition. The sensitivity also decreased as the steps increased for each phantom and confirmedthat it was different depending on the thickness and material. Through this study, we confirmed that3D printing technology can be usefully used for phantom production in the medical field. If furtherdevelopment of printing technology and studies on various materials are conducted, it is believed thatthey will contribute to the development of the medical research environment."

Tourism in the post-COVID era must accept these changes to achieve competitiveness, and evolution is required to strengthen competitiveness and advancement. The world is committing to strengthening industrial competitiveness using big data and artificial intelligence. In line with this trend, tourism is also increasingly demanding a new strategy through a digital transformation of the existing tourism industry that actively utilizes cutting-edge technology. This paper presents problems and policy solutions by analyzing the current status and case studies of smart tourism, the current status of open tourism data in Gangwon, and the conditions of consumers and suppliers in the tourism industry. First, in terms of infrastructure development, we emphasize the need for “digitalization” in revitalizing smart tourism in Gangwon-do to develop infrastructure and recommend the construction of a data distribution platform, the collection of high-quality tourism big data, and the development of a big data collection and analysis system to stimulate smart tourism based on the tourism big data.Second, we propose to improve accessibility by applying information and communication technology to tourism content, such as augmented reality, virtual reality, artificial intelligence (AI), and metaverse, to expand tourism content in response to consumer trends. Third, we propose the development of customized AI models for tourism consumers in Gangwon, the operation and gradual expansion of smart tourism by designating tourist hot spots in Gangwon, and the establishment of a sustainable global AI-tourism research and development ecosystem. The findings of this study are expected to serve as reference materials for developing practical business strategies for institutions and managers who plan and implement smart tourism."

Digital twin applications have two steps: 1) to develop a valid digital twin model to explain the behaviors of agents; 2) to predict changing behaviors of agents in various simulation scenarios. This paper focuses on how to develop scientific evidence-based simulation scenarios from traditional research methods in social science. For this purpose, we attempted to create scenarios from the contingent valuation method in estimating the value of the public bicycle-sharing system in Sejong City, where the digital twin model of the system has been developed to enhance its effective and efficient management. Findings suggest that public bicycle users in Sejong City pay attention to the intermittent short-distance movement demands. In contrast, potential users (or non-users) value a variety of usefulness (such as enhancing health). We therefore suggest two scenarios for redeploying public bicycle stations, as an example. This study provides implications for how governments use digital twin simulation modeling to make intelligent public policy decisions."

In addition, thepresence of clouds affects not only the image processing stage but also the final data quality, so it isnecessary to identify and remove them. Therefore, in this study, we developed a new cloud detectiontechnique that automatically performs a series of processes to search and extract the pixels closest to thespectral pattern of clouds in satellite images, select the optimal threshold, and produce a cloud maskbased on the threshold. The cloud detection technique largely consists of three steps. In the first step, theprocess of converting the Digital Number (DN) unit image into top-of-atmosphere reflectance units wasperformed. In the second step, preprocessing such as Hue-Value-Saturation (HSV) transformation,triangle thresholding, and maximum likelihood classification was applied using the top of the atmospherereflectance image, and the threshold for generating the initial cloud mask was determined for each image.In the third post-processing step, the noise included in the initial cloud mask created was removed andthe cloud boundaries and interior were improved. As experimental data for cloud detection, CAS500-1L2G images acquired in the Korean Peninsula from April to November, which show the diversity ofspatial and seasonal distribution of clouds, were used. To verify the performance of the proposed method,the results generated by a simple thresholding method were compared. As a result of the experiment,compared to the existing method, the proposed method was able to detect clouds more accurately byconsidering the radiometric characteristics of each image through the preprocessing process. In addition,the results showed that the influence of bright objects (panel roofs, concrete roads, sand, etc.) other than cloud objects was minimized. The proposed method showed more than 30% improved results (F1-score)compared to the existing method but showed limitations in certain images containing snow."

Since a dedicated binary storage format and APIs must be used to store and retrieve SEDRIS data, there are a lot of difficulties in sharing and exploiting them in various platforms and applications. In this paper, we propose XML schema constructs for all components of DRM to represent SEDRIS-based data as XML data, which can increase the usability of environmental data built on the SEDRIS standards. We also design and implement a conversion algorithm that transforms a SEDRIS data stored in an STF file into XML data conforming to the proposed schema. Experiments on various example data sets show that the proposed algorithm can generate a valid XML data for a given SEDRIS data efficiently. Based on the proposed method, environmental data stored in SEDRIS proprietary binary files can be represented by platform-independent and language-neutral XML data, making it easy to generate and share environmental data on various platforms and systems without relying on the dedicated APIs.

Adsorption is a common commercial method to concentrate precious molecules or eliminate contaminants, and it is a cost-effective method of treating industrial wastewater. A novel method for increasing their removal effectiveness has been developed for this purpose, using a low-cost biosorbent made from durian husk and Evans blue (EB) dye as a subject. The EB dye adsorption percentage was determined to be 95.95% with 72.0 mg/g adsorption amount at optimal conditions of pH 2 and 40 °C. The second-order kinetic model fit the experimental data the best. Additionally, the results indicated that the Sips isotherm model fits the experimental data better and that the experiment involved single-layer adsorption on the adsorbent surface. A non-linear regression of the van’t Hoff plot gave negative values of Gibbs free energy (−39.38 to −41.48 kJ/mol) at all the temperatures studied (from 20 to 60 °C), indicating that the adsorption process is spontaneous and feasible. A negative value for the enthalpy (ΔHo=−23.37kJ/mol) indicated that the adsorption was exothermic, and the positive value of (ΔSo=54.55kJ/mol·K) concludes the nature of adsorption of Evans blue dye by Durian husk likely to follow a physisorption adsorption mechanism."

This study aimed to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and candidate genes for the number of mummified (NM) piglets using the imputed whole-genome sequence (WGS) and validate the potential candidate genes.Methods: The imputed WGS was introduced from genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) using a multi-breed reference population. We performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for NM piglets at birth from a Landrace pig populatiGWAS peak located on SSC11: 0.10 to 7.11 Mbp (Top SNP, SSC11:1,889,658 bp; p = 9.98E-13) was identified in cyclin dependent kinase on. A total of 300 Landrace pigs were genotyped by GBS. The whole-genome variants were imputed, and 4,252,858 SNPs were obtained. Various molecular experiments were conducted to determine how the genes affected NM in pigs.Results: A strong GWAS peak located on SSC11: 0.10 to 7.11 Mbp (Top SNP, SSC11:1,889,658 bp; p = 9.98E-13) was identified in cyclin dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) gene, which plays a crucial role in embryonic retardation and lethality. Based on the molecular experiments, we found that Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1) was a crucial transcription factor for CDK8, which mediated the effect of CDK8 in the proliferation of porcine ovarian granulosa cells via transforming growth factor beta/small mother against decapentaplegic signaling pathway, and, as a consequence, affected embryo quality, indicating that this pathway may be contributing to mummified fetal in pigs.Conclusion: A powerful imputation-based association study was performed to identify genes associated with NM in pigs. CDK8 was suggested as a functional gene for the proliferation of porcine ovarian granulosa cells, but further studies are required to determine causative mutations and the effect of loci on NM in pigs."

The Multi-Faceted Consequences of NRF2 Activation throughout Carcinogenesis,2023,"['cancer', 'initiation', 'metastasis', 'NRF2', 'promotion', 'transformation']",,"The oxidative balance of a cell is maintained by the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway. This cytoprotective pathway detoxifies reactive oxygen species and xenobiotics. The role of the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway as pro-tumorigenic or anti-tumorigenic throughout stages of carcinogenesis (including initiation, promotion, progression, and metastasis) is complex. This mini review focuses on key studies describing how the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway affects cancer at different phases. The data compiled suggest that the roles of KEAP1/NRF2 in cancer are highly dependent on context; specifically, the model used (carcinogen-induced vs genetic), the tumor type, and the stage of cancer. Moreover, emerging data suggests that KEAP1/NRF2 is also important for regulating the tumor microenvironment and how its effects are amplified either by epigenetics or in response to co-occurring mutations. Further elucidation of the complexity of this pathway is needed in order to develop novel pharmacological tools and drugs to improve patient outcomes."

We quantified the supply of carbon sequestration regulation services in the island forests of Jin-do and Yokji-do. We employed a relative evaluation methodology and estimated carbon storage using above-ground biomass within an absolute evaluation framework. Further, we verified the spatial similarity of these two distinct datasets and derived a relational formula. The main results of the study are as follows.First, the maximum value for carbon sequestration regulation service in Jin-do marginally exceeded that in Yokji-do, although the peak carbon storage values were identical. Second, when spatial similarity between the relative values of carbon sequestration regulation services and absolute values of carbon storage was examined using above-ground biomass, approximately 70% of cells in Jindo and 78% in Yokjido exhibited an absolute deviation of less than 0.3 between the two spatial datasets. Lastly, the spatial similarities between carbon sequestration regulation services and carbon storage amounts elucidated a non-linear relationship. Accordingly, methodological developments for constructing non-linear models are needed when applying land-scoring methods for quantifying ecosystem service supplies and deriving relationship model equations for spatial information with relative and absolute values. Future research should also explore methodologies that amplify the similarity between relative values of ecosystem service supply and absolute carbon storage values by variably applying weights to theme maps utilized in land-use scoring methods."

However, assessment as to the effectiveness of implemented IKM has been inadequately analyzed. This study aims to assess the concepts and limitations of the MOFA’s current IKM strategies and the methods it employs to deliver its IKM framework, in light of strengthening the organizational ambidexterity and absorptive capacity, and also fostering organizational innovation through a qualitative study that involves interviews and analysis of reports from MOFA. The MOFA’s IKM possesses dynamic capabilities to adapt to changing digital technologies. However, the institution’s IKM is constrained by limitations associated with the utilization of the IKM system such as a structure that handles confidential documents and a lack of a collaborative system for IKM, and external limitations such as changes in the domestic political situation governing MOFA’s priorities and the hierarchy of government organizations. Consequently, developing the organizational ambidexterity and absorptive capacity was not possible. To develop an IKM framework for organizational innovation, the MOFA must devise a way to minimize the impact of external changes by overcoming internal limitations. To that end, a detailed study on the development of a practically usable IKM system should include establishing a dialogue between job groups and enhancing employee competency in preparation for a changing environment."

As for the medical space, missionaries brought in the western medical systems that demolished the traditional home-based Chinese medical models, and realized the transformation from medical houses to hospitals. In terms of the medical education system, the talents cultivation modes implemented by mission hospitals were beneficial to the modern transformation of Chinese medical education system; whereas the traditional Chinese medical education were basically old-fashioned, such as imparting from masters to disciples, passing on through family or self-studying. In the way of public health, the missionaries had made four contributions, three of which were directly concerned with public health, intriguing the germinating and development of Chinese public health. Experiencing the suspect, contact, trial, comparison and convincing, Chinese gradually abandoned the prejudice against the western medicine and fundamentally changed the medical concepts. The clash and integration of heterogeneous civilization provoked the reflection and introspection in academic, traditional Chinese medicine and ideological circles, making historical strides under the influence of powerful cultural infiltration of Christianity.Upon the motivation of missionaries, to bring in western medicine was just their means, and their true purpose lays in publicizing Christianity. What was deeply rooted in Chinese hearts, however, was the western medicine instead of Christianity. This had absolutely very close link with pragmatism and copinism in Chinese culture, but it also concerned with the characteristics of western medicine itself. Medicine itself was featured by instrumentality, which meant as long as it was effective, it would be widely acceptable without probing into the academic backgrounds and medical theories behind it. And this not only was the main reason why medical activities by missionaries won the trusts and supports of the public, but the reason why the western medicine with Christianity color could be spread from the masses, the bottom to officials, the top. In addition, it had a complete hospital system and shared totally different methods in diagnosis and treatment as well as treatment space. Therefore, with the dissemination of Christianity, western medicine spreading to the east will promote an all-round transformation of Chinese medical awareness, medical system and medical thoughts."

우유 균질 조건 예측을 위한 반응표면방법론의 활용,2023,"['response surface methodology', 'optimization', 'logit transformation', 'logistic transformation', 'homogenization']",,"Response surface methodology (RSM) is a statistical approach widely used in food processing to optimize the formulation, processing conditions, and quality of food products. The homogenization process is achieved by subjecting milk to high pressure, which breaks down fat globules and disperses fat more evenly throughout milk. This study focuses on an application of RSM including the logit transformation to predict the efficiency of milk homogenization, which can be maximized by minimizing the relative difference in fat percentage between the top part and the remainder of milk. To avoid a negative predicted value of the minimum of this proportion, the logit transformation is used to turn the proportion into the logit, whose possible values are real numbers. Then, the logit values are modeled and optimized. Subsequently, the logistic transformation is used to turn the predicted logit into the predicted proportion. From our model, the optimum condition for the maximized efficiency of milk homogenization was predicted as the combination of a homogenizer pressure of 30 MPa, a storage temperature of 10℃, and a storage period of 10 days. Additionally, with a combination of a homogenizer pressure of 30 MPa, a storage temperature of 10℃, and a storage period of 50 days, the level of milk homogenization was predicted to be acceptable, even with the problem of extrapolation taken into account."

Assessment of the changes in cardiac sympathetic nervous activity using the pupil size changes measured in seated patients whose stellate ganglion is blocked by interscalene brachial plexus block,2023,"['Arthroscopy', 'Brachial plexus block', 'Heart rate', 'Linear models', 'Pupil', 'Shoulder', 'Sitting position', 'Stellate ganglion', 'Sympathetic nervous system.']",,"Background: As a side effect of interscalene brachial plexus block (ISBPB), stellate ganglion block (SGB) causes reductions in pupil size (Horner’s syndrome) and cardiac sympathetic nervous activity (CSNA). Reduced CSNA is associated with hemodynamic instability when patients are seated. Therefore, instantaneous measurements of CSNA are important in seated patients presenting with Horner’s syndrome. However, there are no effective tools to measure real-time CSNA intraoperatively. To evaluate the usefulness of pupillometry in measuring CSNA, we investigated the relationship between pupil size and CSNA.Methods: Forty-two patients undergoing right arthroscopic shoulder surgery under ISBPB were analyzed. Pupil diameters were measured at 30 Hz for 2 s using a portable pupillometer. Bilateral pupil diameters and CSNA (natural-log-transformed low-frequency power [0.04–0.15 Hz] of heart rate variability [lnLF]) were measured before ISBPB (pre-ISBPB) and 15 min after transition to the sitting position following ISBPB (post-sitting). Changes in the pupil diameter ([right pupil diameter for post-sitting – left pupil diameter for post-sitting] – [right pupil diameter for pre-ISBPB – left pupil diameter for pre-ISBPB]) and CSNA (lnLF for post-sitting – lnLF for pre-ISBPB) were calculated.Results: Forty-one patients (97.6%) developed Horner’s syndrome. Right pupil diameter and lnLF significantly decreased upon transition to sitting after ISBPB. In the linear regression model (R2 =0.242, P=0.001), a one-unit decrease (1 mm) in the extent of changes in the pupil diameter reduced the extent of changes in lnLF by 0.659 ln(ms2/Hz) (95% CI [0.090, 1.228]).Conclusions: Pupillometry is a useful tool to measure changes in CSNA after the transition to sitting following ISBPB."

In addition, an empirical analysis was conducted to determine whether there was a difference in business sustainability depending on the business method and trust of the cooperative leader. As a result of the analysis, first, it was found that the transformational leadership of the head of the cooperative had a positive effect on the driving force of the business, but had no effect on the continuity of the business. Second, it was found that the transactional leadership of the union president had a positive effect on business continuity, but had no effect on business driving force. These results suggest that transformational leadership and transactional leadership are complementary to each other because the effect on business performance is different depending on the type of leadership of the head of the cooperative. In particular, it was found that the effect of transactional leadership differs depending on the business method, and the performance of transactional leadership is better in the rapid integrated planning method. In addition, the positive effect of the transactional leadership of the cooperative head was found to be significant only when the trust of the cooperative leader was high."

Feature Extraction and Classification of EEG Signal Using Multilayer Perceptron,2023,"['Electroencephalography', 'Seizure', 'Multilayer perceptron', 'Radial basis function neural network', 'Threshold wavelet transform']",,"Electroencephalography (EEG) is a typical tool utilized for the discovery of epileptic seizures. Notwithstanding, long-term EEG, visual investigation of records is described by its subjectivity, time-consuming procedure, and misdiagnosis. Different types of seizure detection algorithms are used to solve the problems but these methods have a high false classification ratio. Therefore this work introduces a novel automatic seizure detection mechanism to reduce the false classification ratio. The proposed strategies suggest that users choose the appropriate one for a given classification problem. The wavelet transform is based on the principle of describing the temporal evolution of a signal across different time scales by providing information about the local regularity. Multi-Model Features must be extracted from individual sources of data by constructing a signal that is appropriate for the type of data. The extraction of features from one source is independent of the extraction of features from an ECG Signal. Therefore, the proposed method for detecting automatic epilepsy identification may be considered a significant option compared to the traditional strategies, which can reduce the overload of visual analysis and accelerate the detection of seizures."

Perceived age is an important indicator of the overall health status of the elderly. This is because people who appear older tend to have higher rates of morbidity and mortality than people of the same chronological age. Although perceived age is an important indi- cator, there is a lack of objective methods to quantify perceived age. In this paper, we construct a quantified perceived age model from face images using a convolutional neural network. The face images are enlarged to super-resolution and the skin, an important feature in perceived age, is made clear. Moreover, through Tanh-polar transformation, the central area of the face occupies a relatively larger area than the boundary area, helping the neural network better recognize facial skin features. The experimental results show mean absolute error (MAE) of 6.59, showing that the proposed model is superior to existing method."

Investigation of Meta-heuristics Algorithms in ANN Streamflow Forecasting,2023,"['Meta-heuristic algorithms', 'Machine learning', 'Time series forecasting', 'Wavelet transform', 'Optimization', 'Statistical tests']",,"The deterministic approach, which utilizes the gradient information in the search process, is prone to trapping at local minima, primarily due to the presence of saddle points and local minima in the non-convex objective function of an artificial neural network (ANN). This study investigated the efficacy of a hybrid model that adopted a meta-heuristic algorithm (MHA) as an optimizer to extend the training ANN method, from a gradient-based to a stochastic population-based approach for streamflow forecasting. In the latter, parameter tuning utilizing the design of experiment (DOE) technique, has become an integral element in the optimization process due to reliance on their parameters. For model convenience, a wavelet transform was employed to decompose the series into sub-series. The empirical studies of MHA performance showed that the hybrid MHA-ANN was superior for streamflow forecasting, especially with the firefly algorithm that had an average RMSE = 96.06, an improvement of approximately 17% over the gradient-based ANN (RMSE = 113.92). However, among the adopted MHAs, not all are compatible with optimizing the ANN for streamflow forecasting, thus requiring a thorough study as performance varies from case to case. Two additional statistical tests, such as the Kruskal-Wallis H test and the Mann-Whitney U test, further validated such disparity in the MHA's performance."

Despite the growing importance of adaptation to climate change, there remains a large gap in the number and scale of implemented actions and policies. One of the main reasons for such a slow uptake is due to the complexity of the science and uncertainty of future projections thus a high-risk decision- making problem. This paper applies a decision-making support tool that models adaptation pathways to evaluate the long-term effects of adaptation in reducing the impact of multi-hazard risks for the case of Seoul, South Korea. Conventional and nature-based urban heat and flood risk reducing adaptation options are sequenced as pathways against projected climate impacts from 2020 to 2100 and optimized according to minimized impact and cost. According to the pareto portfolio of adaptation pathways, the hard limits of adaptation (risk-reduction) will identify the degree to which transformative measures such as fiscal protection and response is needed. By integrating bottom-up adaptation modeling with the concept of risk-layering, this paper aims to provide a method and framework to guide the question of how much and in what proportion to spend now vs. invest for the future to drive transformational risk management."

Just as the length of music has been drastically shortened in the era of streaming services, music society will undergo another change in the era of AI. Recently, social interest in A.I. has been rising as it has begun to be popularized in earnest. In particular, artificial intelligence based on large-scale language model (LLM) technology, which has been entering the market with rapid momentum since 2023, has been attracting social attention because it creates creations by crossing the domains of literature, music, and art and improves its performance at a rapid pace. However, it seems that the Korean traditional music industry, centered on folk songs, has not yet established an active relationship with this trend. Therefore, this paper seeks to explore how the ecosystem of Korean traditional music centered on folk songs should carry out practices in the rapidly changing technological environment through a review of cases related to AI data development. The Korean government has been comprehensively building data for AI learning by promoting the Data Dam project in 2020. This researcher participated in the project and experienced the entire process of developing Korean traditional music resources into data for AI learning. During the development process, problem cases were captured and analyzed to reflectively examine how folk song data can become a more effective resource for AI. Through the case analysis, we examined the value of folk song resources as data for A.I. technology and examined the affinity of folk songs with A.I. among various traditional music. As a result, we concluded that folk songs have characteristics and strengths that can be established as the first gateway for Korean traditional music to meet A.I. in the A.I. era."

It aims to improve the edge protection capability of the high-order diffusion method using wavelet coefficients that can reflect image information. During the first step of the proposed diffusion method, the wavelet packet decomposition is a more refined decomposition method that can extract the texture and structure information of the image at different resolution levels. The high-frequency wavelet coefficients are then used to construct the edge detection function. Subsequently, because accurate wavelet coefficients can more accurately reflect the edges and details of the image information, by introducing the idea of state weight, a scheme for recovering wavelet coefficients is proposed. Finally, the edge detection function is constructed by the module of the wavelet coefficients to guide high-order diffusion, the denoised image is obtained. The experimental results showed that the method presented in this study improves the denoising ability of the high-order diffusion model, and the edge protection index (SSIM) outperforms the main methods, including the block matching and 3D collaborative filtering (BM3D) and the deep learning-based image processing methods.

The usage of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) for this purpose has escalated. However, early UAV monitoring methods encountered limitations in the continuous installation and field measurement of GCP (Ground Control Points), necessitating the use of a reference DEM (Digital Elevation Model) for elevation correction. Notably, as the study area includes coastal dunes on islands, which differ from the mainland, long-term monitoring involves substantial costs and manpower for GCP surveying. This research introduces an elevation correction method for monitoring changes in coastal dunes, building upon previous studies. UNET was used to distinguish classes in invariant areas and to extract characteristic values from these areas. These values were normalized using the Z-score to eliminate outliers, and a linear regression formula was applied to adjust the DEM values. Over eight years, 13 sets of orthoimages and DEMs were created, both with and without GCPs.

韩汉语解反预期标记“어쩐지”与“怪不得”的认知解读,2023,"['relieved counter-expectation marker', 'ojjonji', 'guàibude', 'expectation category', ""'dual core-drive' model""]",,"'Ojjonji'and 'guàibude' in Korean and Chinese are typical relieved counter-expectation markers in their respective languages, which are mainly driven by the communicative subject's suspicious psychology to produce relieved counter-expectation semantics. Based on previous studies, this paper makes a comparative interpretation of the similarities and differences between 'ojjonji' and 'guàibude' from the cognitive level of disillusion, especially reflecting on causal accessibility and cognitive saltation. We compare from two dimensions: subjective horizontal (dual core) and objective vertical (dual drive). In terms of horizontal causal accessibility, both tend to be forward-driven, but 'guàibude' tends to be more complete than 'ojjonji' in terms of information completeness. In terms of horizontal cognitive saltation, 'ojjonji' breaks through the critical point through the transformation of different categories to achieve a relatively radical transformation saltation, and 'guàibude' realizes a relatively moderate transformation saltation by the side-emphasis of different semantics. In terms of vertical demonstrative resource allocation, the trisection demonstrative system of Korean deviates from the instruction of relieved counter-expectation, while the dichotomy demonstrative system of Chinese is more consistent with the relieved counter-expectation. In terms of vertical resource allocation, 'ojjonji' has relatively narrow sources of information, while 'guàibude' has relatively wide sources of information."

The emergence of this demand can be traced to the close collaboration between art and medicine that began in early modern Italy, leading to differentiation in perspectives on the human body. The remodeling of the Anatomical Theatre of the Archiginnasio in Bologna, where artists and patrons converged, illustrates the transformation of the historical ""Theater of Memory,"" which summarized the history, into a shared space for the contemporary ""Spectacle"" that reflected current ideas. Lelli remodeled the lecturer's pulpit to incorporate contemporary research findings and replaced existing sculptures, thus adapting the “Theater of Memory”, which had previously conveyed medical history, to project a modern medical perspective and enhance the social utility of the space. Benedict XIV, who highly valued this effort, supported Lelli's study and production of anatomical wax models and managed the resulting collection. The culture of the Enlightenment period significantly impacted the spectacle, reflecting contemporary viewpoints, which strengthened interdisciplinary intersections and enhanced the academic utility of anatomical studies. This situation allowed Italy's anatomical collections to spread across Europe through the Grand Tour. The evolving relationship between art and other fields across different eras aids in comprehending art and continually invites fresh interpretations, prompting contemplation of the contemporary social role of artists amidst an increasing interest in interdisciplinary relationships and mutual contributions."

By designing the visual communication design class as an IC-PBL education model, the effectiveness is verified through pre- and post-examinations of social influence, interactivity, self-efficacy, and perceived usefulness, which are variables that affect the implementation expansion of metaverse visual expressions. For all four variables, the posttest results were higher than the pretest scores. Interactivity, a question related to team activity, showed overall significant results, and self-efficacy, a variable of confidence in new technology, was found to have the most significant results on the expansion of visual expression in all questions. The perceived usefulness also showed a significant post-mortem result, but there was no statistically significant difference in social influence, although post-mortem scores were higher than pre-mortem scores.

In addition, increased bearing wear can be experienced when stick-slip nonlinear vibrations persist. In this study, the abnormal vibration and noise occurring in a naval vessel is described when the shaft is starting and stopping, and it is investigated considering the general stick-slip nonlinear vibration characteristics.

To verify the proposed AI-based failure diagnosis algorithm for electric motors, this study utilized the vibration data of mechanical equipment (electric motors) in an urban railway station. Securing and preprocessing high-quality data is crucial for improving the failure-diagnosis rate, in addition to the performance of the diagnostic algorithm. However, the conventional wavelet transform method, which is generally used for machine signal processing, has a disadvantage of data loss when the data distribution is abnormal or skewed. This study, to overcome this shortcoming, proposes an AI-based denoising auto encoder (DAE) method that can remove noise while maintaining data characteristics for signal processing of mechanical equipment. This study preprocessed vibration data by using the DAE method, and extracted significant features from the data through the feature extraction method. The extracted features were utilized to train the one-class support vector machine model and to allow the model to diagnose the failure. Finally, the F-1 score was calculated by using the failure diagnosis results, and the most meaningful feature extraction method was determined for the vibration data.

Looking at the research trend, design of public service indicators, development of evaluation system, and empirical research are being carried out steadily, but there are insufficient research cases on models in which the private sector participates in the planning, development, and operation of public services. In this study, Private-centric digital public service suitability evaluation indicators were discovered through interviews with experts in various fields, and weights for each indicator were analyzed through AHP evaluation. In addition, by applying the analysis results to 18 digital public services on a trial basis, the importance and priority of evaluation indicators for each service were derived, and at the same time, the evaluation framework was designed and applied to diagnose implications. As a result of the study, ‘social utility', ‘corporate acceptability', and ‘public acceptability' were selected as the top three indicators of suitability evaluation. At this time, it was analyzed that the weight of the ‘company acceptability' index, which includes sub-indices such as ‘service profitability', ‘service scalability', and ‘private initiative possibility', was the highest among the three top indicators. As a result of the demonstration for public services, “IoT facility unmanned remote monitoring service”, “blockchain real estate transaction service”, and “digital twin disaster prediction service” were evaluated as the most suitable public services for the transition to the private sector."

This is the first study to simulate the variability and circulation of water mass both overlying the continental shelf and underneath an ice shelf and an ice tongue in the Terra Nova Bay (TNB), East Antarctica. To explore the properties of water mass and circulation patterns in the TNB and the corresponding effects on sub ice shelf basal melting, we explicitly incorporate the dynamic-thermodynamic processes acting on the ice shelf in the Regional Ocean Modeling System. The simulated water mass formation and circulation in the TNB region agree well with previous studies. The model results show that the TNB circulation is dominated by the geostrophic currents driven by lateral density gradients induced by the releasing of brine or freshwater at the polynya of the TNB. Meanwhile, the circulation dynamics in the cavity under the Nansen Ice shelf (NIS) are different from those in the TNB. The gravity-driven bottom current induced by High Salinity Shelf Water (HSSW) formed at the TNB polynya flows towards the grounding line, and the buoyance-driven flow associated with glacial meltwater generated by the HSSW emerges from the cavity along the ice base. Both current systems compose the thermohaline overturning circulation in the NIS cavity. This study estimates the NIS basal melting rate to be 0.98 m/a, which is comparable to the previously observed melt rate. However, the melting rate shows a significant variation in space and time."

To this end, the influence relationship between the open market platform and financial services was derived through the theoretical background and domestic and foreign prior studies. In addition, a research model consisting of a total of nine hypotheses was established, and the questionnaire data of 245 people collected by conducting a survey targeting current and prospective sellers of the open market was used for empirical analysis. As a result of the analysis, prospective sellers showed relatively higher scores for recognizing the importance of loans and insurance than current sellers. This means that open market platforms must provide financial services to entice potential sellers to enter new stores. And the representative seller characteristic variable that affects the importance of financial services is the number of channels. When a seller engages in sales activities that increase the exposure of his/her products, sales increase due to the expansion of market competitiveness, and accordingly, it can be judged that the importance of financial services decreases."

Departmental restructuring often proceeds without proper consultation, leading to conflicts among faculty members over teaching hours. This study analyzed the crisis perception of professors at local private universities amidst the ongoing crisis of regional extinction, surveying factors such as self-esteem, workload, restructuring, and salary, as well as mediating factors like work-related stress and anxiety, and offering policy recommendations to overcome these challenges.(Design/methodology/approach) The measurement model in the structural equation model comprised independent variables, mediating variables, and dependent variables. Independent variables included self-esteem crisis, workload (student recruitment, student management, administrative work), restructuring (department mergers and closures, fear of university survival, internal conflicts), and dissatisfaction with compensation. Mediating variables were work-related stress and anxiety, while the dependent variable was crisis perception. Survey items were structured on a 5-point scale.(Findings) Stress was found to be significantly positively influenced by workload, restructuring, and dissatisfaction with compensation. Anxiety was significantly influenced positively by self-esteem crisis, restructuring, and dissatisfaction with compensation. Mediating variables, stress and anxiety, were positive influencing factors for crisis perception. Self-esteem crisis was not a direct factor affecting stress, but workload was the strongest influencing factor. Overall, higher levels of workload, restructuring, and dissatisfaction with compensation increase stress, and higher self-esteem crisis, restructuring, and dissatisfaction with compensation increase anxiety, ultimately leading to higher crisis perception levels.(Research implications or Originality)  As a policy implication, the following alternatives were suggested.

""Forest Fire"" and ""Rock"", which were published at the same time, are also works depicting humans with God. However, the characters in the early novels created by Kim Dong-li reduce the reality of the theory of humanism in the 3rd period due to the pre-modern atmosphere and the sense of distance from reality.

In ""Brothers"", Inbong's foolish saint is revealed through an irrational scene in which a persecutor of the leftist turns into a person who embraces the child of a leftist figure and is persecuted by the rightist. In ""Liberation"", through Lee Jang-woo's sacrifice, comparable to Jesus' sacrifice on the cross, the character of a realistically possible human god reached the advanced stage. This is similar to the strategy that raised the value of divine human beings, that Kim Dong-li wanted to put forward based on the anti-Christianity in ""Munyeodo"" or ""Cross of Shaban""."

Based on a nonlinear state-space model of the hydraulic-driven barrel servo system (HDBSS) with extensive nonlinearities and uncertainties, a disturbance observer-based prescribed performance dynamic surface controller is proposed. The disturbance observer simultaneously estimates the mismatched and matched disturbances. The prescribed performance constraints predetermine the boundary of the output error. Inspired by the barrier Lyapunov function (BLF), conversion from the original constrained system into an an equivalent error-constrained system’ is realized via a novel error transformation function, which efficiently avoids the calculation of the logarithmic part of the traditional prescribed performance controller. Furthermore, dynamic surface technology is applied in the last step of backstepping controller design to avoid the complexity of differential explosion. The stability and convergence of the closed-loop system are theoretically proven. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified by extensive comparative experimental results."

The most important part of this transformation is liberal education, especially thinking and expression education. In this paper, I try to present the necessity and method of introducing the philosophical cafés model as a way to revitalize creative thinking and non-confrontational discussion education, which are weak parts of thinking and expression education. To this end, the history of philosophical cafés is introduced and their identity is explained. Philosophical café, which originated in France in the 1990’s and spread around the world, is a type of philosophical practices that enjoy collective philosophizing, especially of leisure philosophy. I also explain that leisure philosophy is an activity that is necessary for true happiness to reflect on oneself and the world through the mental activity of contemplation, and its types include the methods of Sartre, Philips, Nelson, and Rahav. I suggest adopting the method of ‘Philosophical Cafe Chuncheon’, which I has been organizing, into the education of thinking and expression. I show that it is different from other philosophical cafés in that it follows the two rules of telling one’s own story and refraining from criticism, and it is a method of inquiry based on Aristotle’s four causes. I also argue that this model can contribute to liberal education in that it can supplement the education of creative thinking and non-argumentative discussion, which are areas lacking in current thinking and expression education, and demonstrate it with examples of lessons."

To construct a dataset for soybean detection, an image-capturing system was developed using a mono camera and single-board computer and the system was mounted on a weeding robot to collect soybean images. A dataset was constructed by extracting RoI (region of interest) from the raw image and each sample was labeled with soybean and the background for classification learning. The deep learning model consisted of four convolutional layers and was trained with a weakly supervised learning method that can provide object localization only using image-level labeling. Localization of the soybean area can be visualized via CAM and the two-dimensional position of the soybean was estimated by clustering the pixels associated with the soybean area and transforming the pixel coordinates to world coordinates. The actual position, which is determined manually as pixel coordinates in the image was evaluated and performances were 6.6(X-axis), 5.1(Y-axis) and 1.2(X-axis), 2.2(Y-axis) for MSE and RMSE about world coordinates, respectively. From the results, we confirmed that the center position of the soybean area derived through deep learning was sufficient for use in automatic weeding systems."

Robust Decentralized Fuzzy Control for Large-scale Descriptor Systems With Decay Rate Constraint,2023,"['Decay rate constraint', 'decentralized proportional-derivative control', 'robust control', 'Takagi-Sugeno large-scale descriptor systems.']",,"This study addresses the control problem of a nonlinear large-scale descriptor system (LSDS) through the use of a decentralized proportional-plus-derivative state feedback fuzzy (DPDF) control strategy. The TakagiSugeno (T-S) fuzzy modeling technique, which is widely used by researchers, is used to describe the nonlinear LSDS as a set of linear subsystems with interconnections. Based on the constructed T-S fuzzy LSDS, a DPDF feedback method is proposed to address the limitations of the descriptor matrix of the T-S fuzzy LSDS and to solve the regular and impulse-free problems of systems while providing a more convenient and effective approach for discussing system stability. Additionally, the Lyapunov theory is chosen to analyze the stability conditions. This study uses a quadratic Lyapunov function to provide sufficient criteria to ensure the decay rate performance of the LSDS, which can be transformed into linear matrix inequality (LMI) form. The proposed method is demonstrated through several examples to showcase its effectiveness."

For example, he actively used the poetic function of ‘the emotion of sorrow’ by transforming it through various inflectional endings. Works where ‘the emotion of sorrow’ appears as a poetic term are mainly early poems written around 1953. Particularly in early poems written between 1953 and 1955, such as ｢Spider｣, ｢Kura Chung-hwa｣, ｢Sorrow Ripening Inside the Room｣, and ｢Helicopter｣, 'the emotion of sorrow's narrative appears directly along with Kim Soo-young’s poetic responses through ‘life’.In the initial discussion, ‘the emotion of sorrow’ was interpreted to a degree as a tendency to transform into sorrow, fatigue, or death. However, considering discussions that it also influenced later poetry, after the 4․19 Revolution, it can be seen as the driving force for Kim Soo-young’s positive mental state of freedom and love, which brought about a change in his poetic attitude. The primary premise of this paper is based on this view, and what it ultimately seeks to argue is whether the sorrow of Kim Soo-young is not just a simple emotion or poetic term but led to freedom of spirit and existential consideration, as a final determination of self-existence, which can be read through conversations with ChatGPT."

This research aims to comprehensively understand older adults by utilizing a mixed-method approach that integrates quantitative and qualitative data. Specifically, we employ the Van Kaam phenomenological methodology to group conversations into nine categories based on emotional cues and conversation participants as key variables, using voice conversation records between older adults and social robots. We then personalize the conversations based on frequency and weight, allowing for user segmentation. Additionally, we conduct profiling analysis using demographic data and health indicators obtained from pre-survey questionnaires. Furthermore, based on the analysis of conversations, we perform K-means cluster analysis to classify older adults into three groups and examine their respective characteristics. The proposed model in this study is expected to contribute to the growth of businesses related to understanding users and deriving insights by providing a methodology for segmenting older adult s, which is essential for the future provision of social robots with caregiving functions in everyday life."

Big online platform companies such as GAFAM(Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Microfsoft) typically operate by trading goods and services in virtual spaces based on digital networks to generate profits. Until recently, the need for regulation of these platforms was considered as inevitable, and the EU has been attempting to establish special regulations targeting these big online platform companies. These efforts has been regulated based on anti-competitive forms, such as data monopolies, including Facebook case in Germany in 2019 and recent amendments to GWB in Germany in response to the EU DMA. These attempts were made by the reason that traditional competition law measures cannot reflect the new characteristics of the many new cases related with big online platforms, which have a significant influence as a new business model in the digital transformation era. Unlike types using the data they have acquired in an anti-competitive form, the recent objects covered by the 2019 German Facebook case and the EU DMA are related to data collected and utilized in the process of collecting personal information, and artificial intelligence's role has been increasing, raising questions about compatibility with competition law. Becuase EU DMA adopts GDPR, so there is a possibility of duplication of regulations on data collection and utilization, and above all, the EU is announcing that it will legislate on the artificial intelligence which treats Data Protection involved in the process through the bill. Therefore, practical considerations are needed on the relationship between these series of data-related laws and competition law regulations. These aspects are significant in Korea, which aims to legislate regulations on online platforms for transactions."

Specifically, we examined the ways in which objective environmental knowledge (OK) and subjective environmental knowledge (SK) are related to ES and EB. Employing a structural equations modeling approach, we tested both the direct and indirect (mediated) effects of EK on EB, taking into account the mediating role of ES. The results indicate a significant positive effect of EK, irrespective of its type, on both ES and EB, and a significant positive effect of ES on EB. The effect of SK on EB was significantly higher than that of OK and was partially mediated by ES. Although the direct effect of OK on EB was not significant, its indirect effect was substantial enough not to be ignored and was found to be fully mediated by ES. These findings demonstrated the crucial roles of both OK and SK in increasing EB, emphasizing the central role of EA in transforming EK into EB. They also suggest that environmental education programs, designed to enhance both OK, SK, and ES, are essential for improving the EB of pre-service early childhood teachers."

Through topic modeling, representative research topics and keywords were derived. In addition, based on Shields' comprehensive definition of character, this study analyzed the characteristics of each implementation period, and identified the trend of change. As a result, we found that the 1st period (2011-2014) focused on 'moral character' emphasizing the minimum level of humanity. The 2nd period (2015-2019) focused on 'performance character' taking account of personal happiness. The 3rd period (2020-May 2023) shows that the concept of character has been gradually expanding to include 'civic character' and 'intellectual character'. Furthermore, we confirm that studies suggesting more systematic and effective character education based on the Character Education Promotion Act, have been continuously being published. Such changes can be interpreted as character education being transformed to prepare for the future society and keep up with rapid social changes. In addition, research to explore the appropriate concepts of character in an era of change, is continuing. Therefore, we propose, firstly, the necessity of redefining the concept and capacity of character explained by the Character Education Promotion Act, and secondly, the improvement of interdisciplinary and convergence research capabilities of character education researchers."

Moreover, a high-precision compensation model is established to calculate machining errors of thin-walled parts in a 5-axis machine tool. In this regard, a comprehensive error model of the S-shaped sample part considering geometric, thermal, and machining errors is established. Then based on the homogeneous transformation matrix, the geometric error models of translational axes and the A and C axes of the rotation axis are established. Accordingly, geometric errors of each motion axes are identified and measured. Meanwhile, the thermal error of the spindle is measured, and the thermal error model of the machine tool along X/Y/Z directions is established using the multiple linear regression method. Finally, the S-shaped sample is processed and the on-machine measurement of the sample surface is carried out. Based on the obtained machining error from the separation method, the distribution of the total surface error at different curvatures of the S-shaped sample is analyzed, and the distributions of geometric and thermal errors of the machine tool are obtained. It is found that when the geometric and thermal errors of the machine tool are compensated, the measured machining error of each point of the S-shaped sample can be reduced by 10-15 μm compared with that before compensation."

After learning several boosting-based ensemble models using the generated final dataset, we demonstrated how these ensemble models classify network traffic using various performance metrics. Based on the F-1 score, we showed that XGBoost with no rare class processing is the best in the multi-class traffic environment. We recognized that machine learning ensemble models through Mitre ATT&CK label conversion and oversampling processing have differences over existing studies, but have limitations due to (1) the inability to match perfectly when converting between existing datasets and Mitre ATT&CK labels and (2) the presence of excessive sparse classes.

D-lactate, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and phosphorylated nuclear factor kappa B (p-NF-κB) p65 was detected by Western blotting. The abundance and diversity changes of intestinal flora were explored using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing.Result: In PF groups, the mucosal morphology of colon tissues was intact, and the glands were arranged neatly and structured clearly, without obvious inflammatory cell infiltration. Compared with the model group, PF groups had significantly elevated pain threshold, and mRNA and protein levels of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin, decreased AWR score at 20 mmHg pressure, fecal water content, mRNA levels of IL-1β, TGF-β, and TNF-α, protein level of p-NF-κB p65 and level of serum D-lactate, and reduced levels of serum IL-1β, TGF-β, and TNF-α (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). PF groups had higher abundance of Lactobacillus, Akkermansia, Alistipes, and Bacteroides, but lower abundance of Desulfovibrio, Parasutterella, and Enterococcus than those of the model group.Conclusions: PF exerts therapeutic effects on IBS in rats probably by regulating the intestinal flora, and then up-regulating the expressions of ZO-1 and occludin in colon tissue while down-regulating the levels of IL-1β, TGF-β, TNF-α, D-lactate and p-NF-κB p65."

Especially, a lot of variants of convolution neural network are widely utilized to develop pixel level prediction model for high dimensional data such as picture, or physical field value from the sensors. In this study, velocity vector field of ideal flow on ship surface is estimated on pixel level by Unet. First, potential flow analysis was conducted for the set of hull form data which are generated by hull form transformation method. Thereafter, four different neural network with a U-shape structure were conFig.d to train velocity vectors at the node position of pre-processed hull form data. As a result, for the test hull forms, it was confirmed that the network with short skip-connection gives the most accurate prediction results of streamlines and velocity magnitude. And the results also have a good agreement with potential flow analysis results. However, in some cases which don’t have nothing in common with training data in terms of speed or shape, the network has relatively high error at the region of large curvature."

Subsequently, it determined the direction for a model green interior horticultural education program. The development of this education program was structured around two main components: indoor gardening techniques and design principles for green interior spaces. This approach was chosen to ensure a well-balanced learning experience. Related class activity maps were created and provided as part of the program. With this framework in place, the study sought to assess the program's impact on students' familiarity with plants and their aesthetic awareness. The subjects of this study were two 5th-grade classes at J Elementary School, located in Seoul. The students were assigned to the experimental and control groups and participated in 18 sessions of the horticultural education program. The results indicated a statistically significant difference between the two groups, demonstrating the effectiveness of the developed green interior horticultural education program in improving elementary school students' familiarity with plants and their aesthetic awareness. This implies that engaging in various activities centered around indoor plants as well as experiencing the design and aesthetic elements of living spaces, yielded significant results. In particular, green interior education, which integrates the two aforementioned domains, underscores the psychological stability and significance of green space by transforming an actual living space into a nature-friendly space and fosters an appreciation for aesthetic beauty through education on indoor design. The study’s findings are expected to serve as foundational data for developing teaching and learning materials for green interior experiences."
Effect of Geogrid Reinforcement and Soil Relative Density on Performance and Contact Pressures of Ring Foundations on Sand,2023,"['Ring foundations', 'Geogrids', 'Bearing capacity', 'Settlement', 'Contact pressure']",,"Reinforcing soil beneath foundations is one of the standard methods to improve the foundation performance. However, soil relative density may affect the efficiency of reinforcement. This experimental study has been conducted on a model ring foundation resting on medium, dense, and very dense geogrid-reinforced sand. For this purpose, 17 tests were carried out to evaluate the effect of soil density and reinforcement depth and size on bearing capacity and settlement of the ring foundation and its normal contact pressure distribution. The results show that geogrid-reinforced sand with higher relative densities improves bearing capacity and decreases settlements significantly. It can be shown that implementing a geogrid layer that is equal to the dimensions of the footing is cost-effective. The scale effect analysis has been conducted for the model foundation, sand, and geogrid used in this research. Additionally, normal contact pressure distributions for unreinforced and reinforced sand are presented.

A multi-targeting bionanomatrix coating to reduce capsular contracture development on silicone implants,2023,"['Capsular contracture', 'Fibrotic tissue formation', 'Myofibroblast differentiation', 'Inflammation', 'Nitric oxide', 'Bionanomatrix']",,"Background Capsular contracture is a critical complication of silicone implantation caused by fibrotic tissue formation from excessive foreign body responses. Various approaches have been applied, but targeting the mechanisms of capsule formation has not been completely solved. Myofibroblast differentiation through the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)/p-SMADs signaling is one of the key factors for capsular contracture development. In addition, biofilm formation on implants may result chronic inflammation promoting capsular fibrosis formation with subsequent contraction. To date, there have been no approaches targeting multi-facted mechanisms of capsular contracture development.Methods In this study, we developed a multi-targeting nitric oxide (NO) releasing bionanomatrix coating to reduce capsular contracture formation by targeting myofibroblast differentiation, inflammatory responses, and infections.First, we characterized the bionanomatrix coating on silicon implants by conducting rheology test, scanning electron microcsopy analysis, nanoindentation analysis, and NO release kinetics evaluation. In addition, differentiated monocyte adhesion and S. epidermidis biofilm formation on bionanomatrix coated silicone implants were evaluated in vitro.Bionanomatrix coated silicone and uncoated silicone groups were subcutaneously implanted into a mouse model for evaluation of capsular contracture development for a month. Fibrosis formation, capsule thickness, TGF-β/SMAD 2/3 signaling cascade, NO production, and inflammatory cytokine production were evaluated using histology, immunofluorescent imaging analysis, and gene and protein expression assays.Results The bionanomatrix coating maintained a uniform and smooth surface on the silicone even after mechanical stress conditions. In addition, the bionanomatrix coating showed sustained NO release for at least one month and reduction of differentiated monocyte adhesion and S. epidermidis biofilm formation on the silicone implants in vitro.In in vivo implantation studies, the bionanomatrix coated groups demonstrated significant reduction of capsule thickness surrounding the implants. This result was due to a decrease of myofibroblast differentiation and fibrous extracellular matrix production through inhibition of the TGF-β/p-SMADs signaling. Also, the bionanomatrix coated groups reduced gene expression of M1 macrophage markers and promoted M2 macrophage markers which indicated the bionanomatrix could reduce inflammation but promote healing process.Conclusions In conclusion, the bionanomatrix coating significantly reduced capsular contracture formation and promoted healing process on silicone implants by reducing myfibroblast differentiation, fibrotic tissue formation, and inflammation.Graphical Abstract A multi-targeting nitric oxide releasing bionanomatrix coating for silicone implant can reduce capsular contracture and improve healing process. The bionanomatrix coating reduces capsule thickness, α-smooth muscle actin and collagen synthesis, and myofibroblast differentiation through inhibition of TGF-β/SMADs signaling cascades in the subcutaneous mouse models for a month."

This aspect is also reflected in the production of tiles, and it shows the process of introducing and settling certain technologies better than any other region, making it a good model for the study of archaeological data.In this article, the roof tile production system was largely divided into three categories, focusing on the membrane in Jeju during the Goryeo Dynasty, and each technical aspect and characteristic were examined. Production System 1 is the result of accepting general technical elements of the Goryeo Dynasty, and it is believed that it was introduced to the Jeju area from the late 10th to the 11th century at the latest. Production System 2 is a technical element that is only found in Jeju, and the possibility of transformation in Jeju cannot be ruled out, as well as the possibility of precedent in Jeollanam-do. As the manufacturing system 3 faithfully reflected Mongolia’s roof tile molding technique, it can be seen that the introduction of the original roof tile manufacturing technique was made in the late 14th century, and the basic aspects of Am and Sukhi follow the manufacturing systems 1 and 2, suggesting that there was an involvement of the local power.It can be seen that the production of tiles in the Jeju area is the result of repeated transformation and creation while constantly accepting new technological elements from the outside and re-engineering them based on them."
"Numerical Investigation of the Pressure-Time Method, Head loss in Developed and Developing Flows",2023,"['Pressure-time method', 'head loss calculation', 'endpoint determination', 'CFD']",,"Hydraulic efficiency is a crucial parameter in estimating the performance of hydraulic turbines. However, the flow rate makes such estimation challenging. Several methods have been developed over the years to measure the flow rate. The pressure-time method is an accurate and inexpensive alternative for flow rate estimation, based on transforming momentum into pressure during the deceleration of a liquid mass. The flow rate is obtained by integrating the differential pressure and the pressure loss history between two cross-sections. In the present work, three-dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses are performed to investigate in detail the influence of the head loss due to friction over the method accuracy when applied in developing flows. One important novelty of the CFD analyses is the use of the immersed solid method for the valve movement modeling for studying the pressure-time method, which is less expensive and more stable than the dynamic mesh method applied in previous CFD studies. The losses are investigated with the assumptions of constant, quasi-steady and unsteady friction factors and compared with detailed data obtained from CFD simulation. The calculated flow rate is not found to be precisely related to the initial pressure drop based on quasi-steady and unsteady friction factors in developing flows. Therefore, a friction factor correction coefficient is proposed and implemented, decreasing the error. The numerical results are validated with experimental data and compared with the dynamic mesh method."

With the help of information technology, “Comprehensive Chinese Ⅱ”are transformed from offline to online classes, and are facing opportunities and challenges. This paper analyzes and summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of online classes with Chinese as a foreign language in teaching. Through discussing the basic mode of online teaching before, during and after class, it puts forward the effective ways and methods to improve the online teaching quality of comprehensive Chinese courses: (1) Guided by Outcomes-based Education (OBE) The teaching design of online courses should be guided by learning outcomes. Learning evaluation should reflect learning outcomes. Learning methods should be oriented to the effectiveness of learning. The content to be learned should be up-to-date and consistent with the times. The learning process should be characterized by advanced, creativity and challenges. (2) Changing the teacher’s role In the face of the ever-upgrading Internet technology, teachers need to keep improving their ability to process information. In other words, teachers should be capable of editing pictures, video, web pages, etc., and be able to solve the common technical problems of network, software, hardware, etc. In addition, teachers should change their teaching patterns from “teaching before learning” into “learning before teaching” and “teaching according to learning”. (3) Changing teaching methods During teaching, it should be student-centered, i.e., teachers should pay attention to the degree of participation, persistence and satisfaction of students in online classes at any time, understand the psychological state and needs of students, constantly adjust the teaching methods, and strengthen the interaction among students and between teachers and students during teaching. (4) Improving the teaching content Teaching content is the focus of teaching, which is crucial in attracting students’ attention and encouraging them to keep studying. Hence, teachers need to carefully select, refine and integrate the knowledge, so that it is suitable for online teaching. It should be noted that teaching content should keep up with time and be close to students’ life, which would allow students to learn what they want to learn, and use what they have learned. (5) Building a teaching team The teaching team of online comprehensive Chinese courses should include first-class TCSL (Teaching Chinese as a Second Language) teachers, managers of Chinese language education institutions, network technologists, learning resource developers, experts in distance education, etc. To let TCSL teachers to participate more in the management of teaching platform is conducive to coordinate synchronous and asynchronous learning, monitor teaching and evaluation, and effectively integrate teaching resources."

Despite its strong path dependency, the U.S. defense system has demonstrated a capacity for innovative and transformative changes when confronted with significant societal challenges. Drawing upon Pierson's institutional change model and March & Olsen's behavioral theory, this paper utilizes a historical institutionalism approach to analyze the evolution of the U.S. defense acquisition system. The study explores how economic and security threats have driven policy actors to initiate institutional changes. In particular, it focuses on the changing role of civilian actors after the end of the Cold War era. It examines how the behavior and preferences of key policy decision-makers and policy implementers have influenced the direction (appropriateness, consequentiality) and patterns(transition, stratification, substitution) of change over different periods. Moreover, as the defense acquisition system matures in its pursuit to leverage private sector capabilities, this research anticipates a cumulative change in the emergence of new institutions(layering), resulting in an expanded and more complex structure of institutions. Consequently, it highlights the need for further studies to address the complexities associated with institutional change."

A closed cycle of sustainable development: Effective removal and desorption of lead and dyes using an oxidized cellulose membrane,2023,['TEMPO-oxidized cotton linters Adsorption Environmental protection Lignin modification UPR composites Mechanical properties'],,"Oxidized cotton linters, TOCell, were used as an adsorbent or derived membrane there from by linterscross-linking with citric acid. The adsorption/desorption study of Pb2+, methylene blue (MB), and crystalviolet (CV) removal, was performed. Adsorption data fitting, obtained using the Langmuir model, gave116 mg g1 (Pb2+), 179 mg g1 (MB) and 482 mg g1 (CV) at 25 ℃ for TOCell linters, while 101 mg g1(Pb2+), 165 mg g1 (MB) and 426 mg g1 (CV) for TOCell membrane. After desorption dyes were subjectedto photocatalytic degradation while lead was transformed into stable lead phthalate (LP), and furtherused as filler in composites based on unsaturated polyester resins (UPR). UPR was synthesized fromwaste polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Structural characterization was performed using FTIR, SEM,and NMR methods. Composites loaded with acryloyl modified kraft lignin (A-KfL) and/or LP was testedfor tensile strength, Vickers microhardness, and fire resistance (UL-94 V method). The best mechanicaland fireproofing properties were obtained at 15 wt.% A-KfL and 40 wt.% Al(OH)3 addition. The resultsof the toxicity leaching test (TCLP) confirmed the environmentally safe stabilization of desorbed pollutantin the UPR matrix. Application of environmentally friendly membranes, susceptible to easy biodegradation,had low negative effects to the environment."
Effect of Ni-doping on coloring and photocatalytic performance of MgTi2O5 nanoceramics,2023,['Ni-doped Magnesium dititanate Soft-Orange Pigments X-Ray Peak Profile Photocatalysis Zeta potential'],,"The Ni-doped MgTi2O5 has been synthesized by sol–gel method and investigated the effect of sinteringwith %Ni content. The heat inspection of intermediate products was done at 1000–1400 C. The structuralproperties of synthesized samples were studied by various methods viz. simultaneous thermal analysis(TGA-DTG), Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Scanningelectron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Zeta Sizer, and UV–VisNIR spectroscopy. The crystallite size of the obtained samples was determined from PXRD analysis usingClassical Scherrer formulae, modified Scherrer model, Williamson–Hall method, and size-strain plotequation. Unit cell parameter was determined precisely from PXRD data based on Rietveld refinementanalysis, which confirmed insertion of Ni2+ ions into the MgTi2O5 structure by decreasing unit cell parameters.Particle size was measured using dynamic light scattering and laser diffraction techniques. Opticalparameter analysis reveals that nano-pigments with narrow bandgap energy were suitable for photocatalysis.Ni0.6Mg0.4Ti2O5 sintered at 1400 C exhibits highest photocatalytic activity (93%) within120 min solar light irradiation. Color properties of the samples were determined from DRS measurementusing CIE-L*a*b* software. The obtained outcomes confirmed that the optical, photocatalytic and colorproperties of prepared samples improved with increasing Ni-contents."

Linear time history analysis is performed on the generated model to collect data for training and testing. The acceleration history response of the top is wavelet-transformed and used as an input image, and the stiffness values of each story used for the corresponding modeling are set as the output value. As a result of applying the example, it is found that the proposed method predicts the behavior and dynamic characteristics of structures similarly, although the degree of error is different for each variable. To reduce this error, a method of applying a genetic algorithm to the predicted value is presented, and the improvement effect of this is confirmed."

The objectives include identifying and extracting their features and characteristics, as well as developing a situation model to understand its dynamics. By synthesizing qualitative research, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the elements that contribute to effective Havruta learning experiences.Methods A systematic literature review was conducted, selecting 34 studies to analyze the Havruta experiences.The features of Havruta learning experiences were extracted from each study and categorized based on their thematic similarities and relationships. A situation model of Havruta learning was developed to effectively present the synthesized data.Results The analysis of the Havruta learning experiences identified both positive and negative aspects reported by students. The findings are categorized into four main categories: awareness of learning, learning attitudes, learning outcomes, and development of competencies. Students positively acknowledge that Havruta learning is enjoyable and less burdensome, and fosters active participation and motivation. They also develop various competencies, including communication, speech, creativity, critical thinking, and metacognition. On the downside, students perceive Havruta learning as noisy and unfamiliar, expressing the need for extended discussion time, more comprehensive guidance on formulating questions, and improved control of interactions. Diverse grouping methods and personalized approaches are also proposed. Additionally, teachers’ Havruta experiences were examined and classified into three main categories: teachers, students, and environment. Teachers notice positive changes in students’ attitudes, competencies and learning outcomes. However, challenges arising from student diversity and classroom limitations are acknowledged, along with the intricacies of managing the learning environment and their own expertise.Conclusions First, Havruta learning has been found to foster the development of diverse competencies among students. Second, the analysis underscores the affirmative impact of Havruta learning on students’ awareness and attitudes towards learning. Third, ‘difficulties’ was identified as a primary concern among negative aspects of Havruta learning. Lastly, existing educational paradigm impeded the full potential of Havruta learning. To ensure successful Havruta learning, a transformative shift in educational culture and the cultivation of supportive teacher training programs are imperative."
Green Fashion: Exploring on How Sustainable Jewelry Design Reshapes Lifestyle Brands,2023,"['Sustainable Jewelry Design', 'Lifestyle Brands', 'Product Quality', 'Green Lifestyles', 'Interdisciplinary Research']",,"This research probes into the influence of sustainable jewelry design on lifestyle brands, green lifestyles, and product quality. Through the lens of multidisciplinary analysis, the study reveals the intricate relationships between these variables and provides a robust theoretical foundation for their interplay. Applying an advanced statistical modeling technique, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), we explore the complex, direct or indirect causal relationships among the variables. The study uses sustainable jewelry design, green lifestyle, lifestyle brands, and product quality as latent variables, revealing their interconnections through a theoretical model built upon previous research assumptions. The findings indicate a significant positive impact of sustainable jewelry design on lifestyle brands and green lifestyles, advocating the importance of such designs in transforming consumer lifestyles and brand choices. However, the anticipated direct influence of sustainable jewelry design on product quality was not as substantial, suggesting further exploration in this dimension.

It offers valuable strategic insights for jewelry brands and advances the broader discourse on sustainable production and consumption, thereby underscoring the value of a multidisciplinary approach in understanding consumer behavior and brand strategy."
A Parallel-Structure-Based Sliding Mode Control for Trajectory Tracking of a Quadrotor UAV,2023,"['Quadrotor UAV', 'Sliding mode control', 'Lyapunov theory', 'Hurwitz stability']",,"In this paper, aiming at the problem of incomplete yaw angle working range in a class of sliding mode control for quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a parallel-structure-based sliding mode control (PSMC) method is proposed. Firstly, the dynamic model of the quadrotor UAV is considered to be composed of fully actuated subsystem and underactuated subsystem. For the fully actuated subsystem, the regular sliding mode manifold is used to design the controller. For the underactuated subsystem, the coordinate transformation of the error is taken into account in the sliding mode manifold. The coefficients of the sliding mode manifold can be obtained by the Hurwitz stability analysis. In addition, the stabilities of two subsystems are demonstrated by Lyapunov theory. Finally, comparative simulation results show that the PSMC not only improve the working range of yaw angle, but also illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method."
Myo-Inositol Attenuates Renal Interstitial Fibrosis in Obstructive Nephropathy by Inhibiting PI3K/AKT Activation,2023,"['HK-2', 'Myo-inositol', 'PI3K/AKT', 'renal interstitial fibrosis', 'unilateral ureteral obstruction']",,"Emerging evidence suggests that myo-inositol (MI) has a critical role in reducing renal inflammatory processes and improving podocyte function and preventing diabetes-related renal damage. We aimed to explore the function and underlying workings of MI in renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF). Based on a mouse model, we explored the effect of MI in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and in transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-treated HK-2 cells. Pathological changes of the kidney tissues were examined following staining of the tissues with hematoxylin, eosin, and Masson's trichrome. The mRNA quantities of fibrosis markers, fibronectin, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and collagen I, were analyzed by means of real-time polymerase chain reaction, whereas those of protein levels were assessed with Western blotting. We also determined the expression of collagen I by immunofluorescence, and the levels of phosphorylated phosphotidylinositol-3-kinase and protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) by Western blot. In vivo, histopathological examination in the UUO mice revealed renal tubular epithelial cell necrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, and RIF. UUO mice showed higher expression levels of collagen I, fibronectin, α-SMA, pPI3K, and pAKT compared with sham-operated mice. However, MI treatment diminished the pathological alterations of RIF in UUO mice and downregulated the expression of fibrosis markers and phosphorylated PI3K/AKT. In vitro, TGF-β1 positively influenced the propagation and differentiation of HK-2 cells and upregulated the levels of α-SMA, fibronectin, collagen I, pPI3K, and pAKT, but these became significantly reversed by MI treatment. In conclusion, MI ameliorates RIF, possibly by negatively regulating TGF-β1-induced epithelial transdifferentiation and PI3K/AKT activation."
Organic/inorganic nanohybrid of MgAl@CuFe2O4-polylysine for hazardous Cr(VI) and methyl orange uptake: Multivariate optimization and isotherm study,2023,"['Cr(VI)', 'Methyl Orange', 'Mixed Oxide', 'Polymer']",,"An efficient organic/inorganic magnetic nanohybrid of MgAl@CuFe2O4-polylysine was successfully synthesized and employed as a suitable adsorbent for removal Cr(VI) and methyl orange from water solution. The prepared nanohybrid was characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, vibrating sample magnetometer and thermogravimetric analysis. The nanohybrid of MgAl@CuFe2O4-polylysine was employed to adsorb anionic species, i.e., Cr(VI) and methyl orange through electrostatic attraction, ligand exchange and ion exchange. Multivariate optimization with Box-Behnken design was used to evaluate effective parameters such as dosage of adsorbent, solution pH and contact time on adsorption and their interaction. Results showed that pH, contact time and adsorbent dosage are effective parameters for Cr(VI) adsorption; however, the pH of the solution is the sole effective parameter for methyl orange adsorption. Both analyte adsorptions are fast with adsorption times less than 15 min. Isotherm study revealed that the prepared nanohybrid is a highly efficient adsorbent for methyl orange and Cr(VI) with adsorption capacity of 693.6 and 281.8 mg g−1, respectively. Isotherm study showed that adsorption of both analytes well fitted with the Freundlich adsorption isotherm model, which indicated multilayer adsorption on the heterogeneous surface. The magnetic saturation for the prepared adsorbent was 12.64 emu g−1, which was adequate and suitable for magnetic separation of samples. The prepared adsorbent was regenerated using ethanol-aquaeous NaOH solution as it shows 90% removal efficiency after three cycles."

It examines how Arendt, from the perspective of social contract theory, rejected the absoluteness of state sovereignty and the element of violence associated with politics through the concept of ‘mutual promise’, and how her understanding of law as ‘relationship establishment’ that goes beyond the ‘sanctification of the people’ (or divine legislation) is more suitable for the social contracts of the post-Westphalian world. Furthermore, it discusses how Arendt transforms the concept of social contract from the realm of hypothetical agreements into a stage for political practice. Through these theoretical reconstructions it seeks to explore a new practical theory for social contract that is suitable for a new beginning in an ever-changing era."

In a complex system, collective action is through the network and collective intelligence matter; in a hyper-connected society that will be accelerated by digital transformation, organizations that find and interpret deep data hidden inside humans will survive beyond big data. The more open society becomes, the more important democratic governance will be; at the same time, there will be more intolerance against the enemies of the open society. It is necessary to communicate with members and meet the step-by-step needs of safety, trust, and security that the risk society warns about. The platform society designs is a new business profit model through unformed data.Therefore, even in the future, the traditional cooperative philosophy or values that pursue solidarity, reciprocity economy, and common good through collective action, humanism, democratic governance, and mutual aid will become more necessary. Plus, ‘Platform cooperativism’ will become commonplace. It really helps to overcome big concerns about platform capitalism or data monopoly, which began in earnest after the 4th industrial revolution.Therefore, the purpose and essence of a cooperative, that is, the identity of a cooperative by members for members, and the characteristics of a patrons-owned firm (POF), are very important in the process of legislating future cooperative legislation. In particular, capital procurement, insurance, and financial functions, welfare business, and platform cooperativism in the cooperative legislation should be considered."

COVID-19 has served as a significant test of China’s responsibilities and role as a great power. China has not adopted Western developed countries as models in epidemic prevention; instead, it has taken pride in its own epidemic prevention methods. In the aftermath of the outbreak, China crafted a narrative of successful epidemic prevention and disaster recovery through active state intervention. In doing so, the government envisioned a narrative of economic development to propel China forward. In the initial stages of the pandemic, following successful containment, this narrative appeared to be effective.However, as the pandemic persisted, China’s formula for successful development was no longer applicable. With the pandemic spreading globally and mounting criticism directed at China for its failure to contain it, the Chinese government found itself in a difficult position. In its efforts to control COVID-19 within China, the government became increasingly obsessed.The continued enforcement of controls further depressed the Chinese economy and created challenges in finding a way out. This situation has become a significant obstacle to China’s transition from a member of the G2 to a superpower through successful economic growth following reform and opening up. The transformation of COVID-19 into an uncontrollable endemic has also kindled a desire for freedom and democracy within China. The persistence of control has placed a substantial strain on Chinese society and the economy.By the end of 2022, international restrictions related to COVID-19 were lifted. However, the Chinese government missed the opportunity to voluntarily relax its controls and instead did so semi-voluntarily."

But the disadvantage is that there is still an expression of female images from a male perspective in the film. The narrative mode of seemingly ""strong women and weak men"" still maintains the visual pleasure centered on patriarchy.This paper takes the animation ""Green Snake"" as the research object, uses Laura Mulvey's gaze theory as a methodology, and analyzes the female image in the film from the perspective of the mechanism of visual pleasure. This paper discusses the process of voyeuristic female image becoming a symbolization attached to the ""other"", and analyzes the underlying patriarchal mechanism, implicit male subject narrative, and female sexual transformation into male moderation to expose the male castration anxiety exposed under the female theme narrative. In this way, from the perspective of male directors, men exercise their consolidation of the male authoritative order through the incorrect expression of female images. It expounds that the image of women in Chinese women-themed animated films is still confined to the framework of male discourse power. This article points out the wrong expression of female images under the male order in the film from the perspective of female criticism. If the proposed part is circumvented, this study has a certain value in promoting the true liberation of female images in female-themed animation from male ideology."
LQR Pendulation Reduction Control of Ship-Mounted Crane Based on Improved Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm,2023,"['Ship-mounted crane', 'LQR controller', 'Grey wolf optimization algorithm', 'Parameter optimization', 'RBF neural network']",,"The poor adaptability matrix of traditional LQR controller causes the problems of large payload swing and slow response for ship-mounted cranes during operation. To solve such problems, an LQR controller based on an improved grey wolf optimization algorithm (IGWO-LQR) is proposed. Firstly, the dynamics model of ship-mounted crane is constructed, the pendulum reduction problem is transformed into the LQR quadratic performance index problem, and IGWO is used to optimize the weight matrix. At the same time, the RBF neural network is applied to compensate for the non-linear wave disturbances in the system. Finally, the pendulum reduction efficiency of the controller under different parameters and conditions is verified by numerical simulation. Compared with the traditional LQR controller, the simulation results show that the control accuracy of the IGWO-LQR controller is improved by about 5%, and the response speed is improved by about 5–10 s. This method can significantly reduce the payload swing and improve work efficiency."

First, an augmented two-dimensional (2D) system is constructed by state augmentation technique and a 2D model approach. Then, the preview repetitive control laws are proposed for the augmented 2D system, which transforms the preview repetitive control problem into a stabilization problem. Using Lyapunov functions, sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability of the 2D continuous-discrete system are derived in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The design of a preview repetitive controller is proposed through the LMI approach. Finally, the developed design techniques are applied to two examples. The simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method."

Removal of free fatty acid from waste cooking oil using an adsorbent derived from cassava peels,2023,"['Waste Cooking Oil', 'Free Fatty Acid', 'Adsorption', 'Adsorbent', 'Cassava Peels']",,"The present study investigated the potential use of the cassava peel-derived adsorbent for removal of free fatty acid (FFA) from waste cooking oil (WCO). The adsorbent A3 was developed by calcination at 200 °C for 2 hours, followed by NaOH modification. The surface morphology and functional groups of A3 were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Adsorption parameters, such as adsorbent dose, contact time, and temperature, influenced the adsorption efficiency of A3 for FFA. Isotherms, kinetics and thermodynamics of free fatty acid (FFA) adsorption onto A3 were investigated. The maximum adsorption capacity (qm) of A3 for FFA was 322.58 mg/g at a temperature of 35 °C. Adsorption isotherm was well described by the Freundlich model (R2=0.9676), while adsorption kinetics was best fitted with pseudo-second order model (R2=0.9996). Kinetic data revealed that the adsorption of FFA onto A3 was chemisorption. Thermodynamic studies revealed that FFA adsorption was endothermic, favorable, and spontaneous. In addition, diethyl ether and chloroform : methanol (2 : 1, v/v) could be used for chemical regeneration of A3. Our results confirmed that A3 has the potential to be a suitable adsorbent for FFA removal from WCO."
Robust back‑stepping sliding mode control for LCL‑type grid‑connected inverters in weak grids,2023,"['Grid-connected inverter', 'Feedback exact linearization', 'Back-stepping sliding mode control', 'Robust scheme']",,"Gird impedance variations in a weak grid can easily lead to the instability of grid-connected inverters with an LCL filter. In this paper, a robust back-stepping sliding mode control strategy for the LCL-type grid-connected inverter is proposed to ensure local asymptotic stability. First, due to its nonlinear switching problem, the model is transformed into the Brunovsky canonical form of a linear system, using the exact feedback linearization theory. Then, to ensure global stability and rapid dynamic performance, a back-stepping sliding mode control strategy is recursively derived. Furthermore, under the premise of asymptotic stability, a robust scheme is developed to obtain appropriate parameters against grid impedance variations. Hence, the expected stability performance can be achieved and the dynamic performance can be improved in a weak grid. Finally, a 2 kW prototype is constructed, and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller when compared with the conventional back-stepping scheme."

First, the advent of standardized new seasonings due to industrialization led to changes in the dietary habits and modernization of taste in colonial Korea. A key factor in this transformation was identified through contemporary newspaper advertisements. One strategy involved the 'localization' of the product through advertising, while the other focused on targeting a new consumer group, namely 'housewives.' Ajinomoto attempted to localize its product by featuring Koreans as models in their advertisements, incorporating illustrations and text that reflected their daily lives and social phenomena. Furthermore, the concept of the 'housewife,' born out of modern capitalism, was positioned as an agent for reforming pre-modern, outdated customs and systems. The advertisements leveraged the psychology of women aspiring to be 'housewives' to showcase a variety of promotional campaigns. Therefore, this study aims to explore various aspects of how the image of the 'housewife' in Ajinomoto newspaper advertisements from the 1920s and 1930s reproduced their identity and modernity, played a role in improving domestic life, and led the way in standardization."
Highly synergic adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of walnut shell biochar/NiCr-layered double hydroxides composite for Methyl orange,2023,['NiCr-LDH Biochar MO Adsorption Photocatalytic degradation'],,"Methyl orange (MO) is a kind of azo dye, and will do great harm to the ecological environment.Alleviating this problem by removing MO is crucial role to prevent harmful damage to the environment.In this paper, NiCr layered double hydroxides (LDH) were prepared through hydrothermal method andthen modified with different mass rations of walnut shell biochar. The structure and properties ofbiochar/NiCr-LDH composites were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), powderX-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) coupled with energy dispersespectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Moreover, the adsorption andphotocatalytic degradation behavior of composites on anionic dye MO were investigated.Characterization results indicated that NiCr-LDH was perfectly synthesized and coated on the biochar.All the biochar/NiCr-LDH composites show enhanced adsorption and photodegradation performancefor MO dye compared with pure NiCr-LDH and biochar. When the biochar content was 22.3 wt.% andthe biochar/NiCr-LDH (S2) dosage was 1.0 mg/mL, the maximum removal amount of MO could reach100 % within 60 min at the natural pH, experimental data fitted well with the pseudo-second-orderkinetic and Freundlich isotherm model, and the maximum adsorption capacity of S2 was 108.2 mg/g.Besides, compared with NiCr-LDH, S2 also demonstrated wonderful photodegradation activity for MOunder visible-light irradiation, the rate constant of S2 (0.0173 min1) is about 1.5 times that of NiCr-LDH (0.0118 min1), and the enhanced performance can be due to the faster separation of electronholepairs, in which biochar acted as charge separation carriers. Meanwhile, the hydroxyl radical andsuperoxide radical played crucial roles in the dye photocatalytic degradation, and a possible photocatalyticdegradation mechanism was proposed. The excellent photocatalytic activity and stability makebiochar/NiCr-LDH an ideal photocatalyst to solve environmental crisis."

Novel Genome-Wide Interactions Mediated via BOLL and EDNRA Polymorphisms in Intracranial Aneurysm,2023,['Boule · Endothelin receptor type A · Genome-wide association study · Intracranial aneurysm.'],,"Objective : The association between boule (BOLL) and endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA) loci and intracranial aneurysm (IA) formation has been reported via genome-wide association studies. We sought to identify genome-wide interactions involving BOLL and EDNRA loci for IA in a Korean adult cohort.Methods : Genome-wide pairwise interaction analyses of BOLL and EDNRA involving 250 patients with IA and 296 controls were performed using the additive effect model after adjusting for confounding factors.Results : Among 512575 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 23 and 11 common SNPs suggested a genome-wide interaction threshold (p<1.25×10-8) involving rs700651 (BOLL) and rs6841581 (EDNRA). Rather than singe SNP effect of BOLL or EDNRA on IA development, they showed a synergistic effect on IA formation via multifactorial pair-wise interactions. The rs1105980 of PTCH1 gene showed the most significant interaction with rs700651 (natural log-transformed odds ratio [lnOR], 1.53; p=6.41×10-11). The rs74585958 of RYK gene interacted strongly with rs6841581 (lnOR, -19.91; p=1.64×10-9). Although, there was no direct interaction between BOLL and EDNRA variants, two EDNRA-interacting gene variants of TNIK (rs11925024 and rs1231) and FTO (rs9302654), and one BOLL-interacting METTL4 gene variant (rs549315) exhibited marginal interaction with BOLL gene.Conclusion : BOLL or EDNRA may have a synergistic effect on IA formation via multifactorial pair-wise interactions."

With the gradual development of agricultural productivity and population growth since the 14th and 15th centuries, agricultural production could sustain the tribute, making labor services more accessible for purchase. The transition in the State Service System, where labor was exchanged for in-kind payment, led to a shift in the value of tributes to standard equivalents like rice, cotton fabrics, and coins. State finance, following the model of Zu-Yong-Diao, was reconstructed by Jeonjeong, Gunjeong, and Hwanjeong, incorporating tributes (Diao) on land and adding grain loans to revenue. As Land Taxes became the primary revenue source of the state finance, it resulted in the revenue elasticity highly affected by agricultural conditions. The statewide circulation of Sangpyeong Tongbo coins was a supplementation which could relieve the variability of the state finance, while meeting its own currency demand. The implementation of the Daedong Law, which promoted in-kind payment for personal labor, led to the estimation of various Service Price. This process was concluded by the Gyunyeok Law, which equalized the prices of services. The Daedong Law was a systemized approval of Bangnap, a locally operated tribute contracting, but the issues persisted with local miscellaneous corvee labor, which were not covered by Daedong. The introduction of the People’s Granary was a response by the local authorities to address these issues, indicating that the application process of the Daedong Law was still evolving. Under the Daedong Law, the procurement of tributes transitioned into a finance involving rice, cotton fabrics, and coins, mediated by land. Dynastic rule over the people was heading from personal unpaid labor towards anonymous compensated labor. However, comprehensive systemic reform for the financialized corvee labor had not yet been achieved. Additionally, the Daedong Law transformed most tributes into standard values, exchangeable for rice, cotton fabrics, and coins. This resulted in the categorization of state finance into ‘Gukyong’, state expenditure, and rationalization of management. Commerce became more closely aligned with and subordinate to state logistics. The Daedong Law also created complex variants of itself such as the Sangjeong Law and the Sumi Law, making it an important area for future research to gain a broader perspective on the theoretical characteristics of tribute system reform, through more specific investigations of attributes shown in different Provinces."

To reduce the collision risk between vehicles and pedestrians, we need to identify the risky situations and find the factors affecting it. We propose a method identifying the potential collision risks of vehicle-pedestrian interactions near crosswalks by applying computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques on videos. First, we employ a mask R-CNN model and transformation matrix in OpenCV to recognize the precise positions of the road users (e.g. vehicle and pedestrian) in orthogonal view. Next, we track their trajectories using the modified Kalman filter method. After extracting their interactions from trajectories of road users, we analyze their potential collision risks near crosswalks. In our experiments, we collected the video footage from 9 cameras in Osan City, tracked road users in videos, and analyzed the potential collision risks between them. On this video, the accuracy of road user detection was about 90% for both the vehicles and pedestrians when the distance tolerance is 50cm. For the tracking accuracy, our modified Kalman filter outperformed the threshold and minimum distance method by 3%. In analysis part, we elicited the valuable information that the vehicle speed is high on a wide road without a speed camera and the pedestrian safety margin is small on unsignalized crosswalks. We further observed that around 50% of cars do not stop before crosswalk when pedestrians cross the un-signalized crosswalk without having special warning signs such as red urethane road pavement and school zone marking on road."

To achieve this objective, intermediate features were extracted from the input images at specific layers (FM1~FM4) of the pre-trained network (Resnet-18). These extracted intermediate features and original images were used as inputs to the vision transformer (ViT), and the FER performance was compared. As a result, when using a single image as input, using intermediate features extracted from FM2 yielded the best performance (training accuracy: 94.35%, testing accuracy: 75.51%). When using the original image as input, the training accuracy was 91.32% and the testing accuracy was 74.68%. However, when combining the original image with intermediate features as input, the best FER performance was achieved by combining the original image with FM2, FM3, and FM4 (training accuracy: 97.88%, testing accuracy: 79.21%). These results imply that incorporating intermediate features alongside the original image can lead to superior performance. The findings can be referenced and utilized when designing the preprocessing stages of a deep learning model in FER. By considering the effectiveness of using intermediate features, practitioners can make informed decisions to enhance the performance of FER systems."

In the past, to prevent erroneous detection of SLGF due to leakage current, Fast Fourier Transform(FFT) was used to determine SLGF only with the fundamental wave component, but FFT can generate errors depending on the sampling frequency. This paper proposed a new type of zero-phase current detection method using CNN in High Resistance Grounding System. The simulation was performed in the proposed High resistance grounding system(HRGS), and a CNN model generated with a distorted voltage source (reflecting harmonics frequently generated in the proposed system) and a harmonics generating load (rectifier) was verified. As a result, it was confirmed that the zero-sequence current fundamental wave was accurately detected and that an accurate SLGF determination was possible."
Tool wear monitoring based on an improved convolutional neural network,2023,['· Tool wear · Condition monitoring · Convolutional neural network · Support vector machine · Blisk'],,"Tool condition is the key factor affecting the quality and efficiency of precision cutting of parts. As tool wear is inevitable during machining, tool wear status during machining must be regularly monitored. This study proposes a combined convolutional neural network and support vector machine (SVM) approach for tool wear status monitoring. First, 1D cutting force data are wavelet-transformed and converted into 2D spectrogram. Second, the leakyReLU activation function is adopted to enhance network robustness. Third, an SVM classifier is used to replace the traditional Softmax function to improve the model generalization capability.Finally, the cutting force signal of the tool used for the machining of the aero-engine integral blisk is verified. The accuracy of the constructed network model can reach 98.28 %. Moreover, the proposed model has a simple structure, requires a small number of parameters, and has good robustness and reliability."

The K-means++ clustering method was also integratedto generate anchor boxes that are more suitable for the dataset. The experimental results show that the improvedalgorithm achieved an accuracy of 97.33%, higher than other methods. The detection speed of the proposedapproach is higher than that of YOLOv4, improving the efficiency and accuracy of the detection process."

In this paper, for complex-valued spectrum based speech enhancement, Self-Attention (SA) method is applied to skip-connection to transform the feature of encoder to be compatible with the features of decoder. SA is a technique in which when generating an output sequence in a sequence-to-sequence tasks the weighted average of input is used to put attention on subsets of input, showing that noise can be effectively eliminated by being applied in speech enhancement. The three models using encoder and decoder features to apply SA to skip-connection are studied.

Clamping Error Calibration Algorithm of Aero-Engine Blade Surface Polishing,2023,"['Blade polishing process', 'Clamping error calibration', 'Error evaluation', 'Optimization algorithm']",,"Polishing is an effective process method to improve the surface quality of aero-engine blade. The clamping error between fixture and blade leads to position error of blade surface and reduces processing quality. In this paper, a laser calibration system and a calibration algorithm are proposed to compensate clamping error. Firstly, theoretical point data of blade surface is obtained from CAD model, and the measurement point data of blade surface is obtained through laser sensor. A modified ICP algorithm is designed to calculate the coordinate transformation between the theoretical points and the measurement points. Secondly, Bezier surface is introduced to evaluate the calibration accuracy based on the distance between fitting surfaces rather than points. Finally, the point cloud registration is optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm based on the Bezier surface evaluation. The calibration algorithm combined ICP algorithm, Bezier surface evaluation and PSO algorithm to realize clamping error compensation. The quality of polished blade surface is consequently improved."

In the preprocessing, image fragments are removed to reduce the complexity of the algorithm and increase the accuracy of automatic annotation. The image feature extraction was implemented by the scaling invariant feature transformation (SIFT) algorithm, and the image annotation algorithm was constructed based on the similarity between tag words and an image. Experimental results show that the recall rate of the algorithm reaches 97%, and the standard deviation of the normal distribution of automatic labeling after 300 iterations was 11. The results show that compared with the existing image automatic annotation methods, the proposed image automatic annotation algorithm has higher accuracy and better performance."

Secondly, from the perspective of diachronic, it establishes the dimension of vertical comparison, so as to define the innovative characteristics of Sun Wukong’s artistic image in different periods.Thirdly, from the perspective of innovation theory, it classifies the innovative artistic images and innovative features of Sun Wukong in animation films so far. Finally, it discusses the challenges and opportunities of the innovation of Sun Wukong’s artistic image. This study is not limited to analyzing the images of Sun Wukong in different periods separately, but focuses on the historical continuity of the object of research and the innovation behind it.In the process of exploring the image of visual art, numerous animated films related to Sun Wukong were chosen as the key objects of research. Through analysis, it is found that in the history of Chinese animated films, the innovation of the artistic image of Sun Wukong presents three stages. The first stage is the early exploration stage under the combination of Chinese and Western, which reflects the chaotic state of learning from the American Disney while trying to retain the Chinese style. The second stage is the exploration stage of socialist national characters, which reflects that under the state of the national system, the superior resources of the whole country are pooled to build the animation model representing the national image. Moreover, due to the application of traditional opera and painting elements, the artistic image of Sun Wukong characterizes the quintessence of China.Third, it is the stage of national cultural confidence supported by new technology. With the help of increasingly mature 3D animation production technology, the two animated films of Sun Wukong born in the 21st century reflect the consumption concept of the new generation of young people, resulting in the artistic image of Sun Wukong blending into the characteristics of the national tide.From analytical perspective of historical vertical comparison, it is found that the innovation of Sun Wukong’s artistic image presents four types: continuous and restrained innovation, continuous and fundamental innovation, intermittent and restrained innovation, and intermittent and fundamental innovation. The remarkable features of its innovation are: the innovation is restrained in most cases. Innovation tends to be interrupted; Innovation is a complex and non-linear process. Fundamental innovation needs to be supported by sustained and strong investment of resources. Through further analysis of the challenges faced by innovation, it is proposed that the adaptation to the external demands of the system is the key element supporting the innovation of artistic image of Sun Wukong."
A Novel Precision Synchronization Control via Adaptive Jerk Control with Parameter Estimation for Gantry Servo System,2023,"['Adaptive jerk control (AJC)', 'cross-coupled control (CCC)', 'gantry servo system', 'permanent magnet linear synchronous motors (PMLSMs)', 'synchronization control', 'uncertainty.']",,"This article presents a novel precision synchronization control method and corresponding control design using adaptive jerk control (AJC) with parameter estimation to improve the synchronous performance for gantry servo system with parametric variations and unknown disturbances. Initially, cross-coupled control (CCC) is provided to realize the synchronous cooperation of two parallel permanent magnet linear synchronous motors (PMLSMs), and the coupled system model is transformed into a state-space form. Consequently, the filtered errors based on synchronous error and position tracking error are established to simultaneously guarantee that both the synchronous error and position tracking error converge to zero asymptotically. Then, AJC is proposed to handle the uncertainty. More specifically, an adaptive feedback gain is involved in the AJC for improving the robustness, without requiring a priori knowledge of the uncertainty. A novel adaptation law is introduced to update the adaptive feedback gain. Moreover, a terminal attractor is incorporated into the adaptation law to improve the convergence even with noise. Therefore, the chattering phenomenon are significantly alleviated. Meanwhile, parameter estimation is employed to address the model parametric variations. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and superior performance of the precision synchronization control method."

Production System 1 is the result of accepting general technical elements of the Goryeo Dynasty, and it is believed that it was introduced to the Jeju area from the late 10th to the 11th century at the latest. Production System 2 is a technical element that is only found in Jeju, and the possibility of transformation in Jeju cannot be ruled out, as well as the possibility of precedent in Jeollanam-do. As the manufacturing system 3 faithfully reflected Mongolia’s roof tile molding technique, it can be seen that the introduction of the original roof tile manufacturing technique was made in the late 14th century, and the basic aspects of Am and Sukhi follow the manufacturing systems 1 and 2, suggesting that there was an involvement of the local power.It can be seen that the production of tiles in the Jeju area is the result of repeated transformation and creation while constantly accepting new technological elements from the outside and re-engineering them based on them."

Construction of Satellite Genetic System for Robust and Versatile Inter-species Gene Function Analyses in Viola,2023,['Viola Satellite genetic system Genetic engineering V. philippica V. odorata V. cornuta V. x witrockiana'],,"The genus Viola is among the largest genera in angiosperm, which includes many ornamental crops and wild herbs broadly consumed in human society. The members of Viola are one of very few taxonomic groups that produce cyclotide, a novel molecular scaffold for drug discovery, and various unique adaptive behaviors, such as dimorphic pollination strategies and mutualistic interaction with insect in seed dispersal, are also widespread across Viola species. However, the lack of effective model species that are genetically accessible and insufficiently cataloged genetic engineering methods have rendered the genus remaining largely unexplored. Here, using V. philippica as a central model organism, our study constructs the satellite genetic system that enables versatile and robust comparative gene function studies in Viola. In V. philippica, in vitro whole plant regeneration from various somatic tissues was achieved through the relayed actions of two cytokinin analogs, thidiazuron (TDZ) and 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), and the optimized de novo plant regeneration led to highly efficient and heritable Agrobacterium-dependent genetic transformation being constructed. We further demonstrate CRISPR/Cas9-mediated site-directed genome editing that resulted in induced polymorphisms at the selected genomic loci and tobacco rattle virus-based virus-induced gene silencing (TRV-VIGS) that elicited the targeted and systemic host gene silencing, thereby presenting multiple routes to manipulating gene functions in the model Viola species. Furthermore, by applying the techniques established in V. philippica to multiple other Viola species that differ markedly in their evolutionary behaviors, the potent comparative study system was verified. Our study therefore provides a methodological framework instigating molecular dissection and engineering of novel genetic traits in phytochemistry, body architecture, and organ differentiation that evolved during the diversification of Viola species."

The research finds that the curriculum is evolving towards building a human model that nurtures democratic citizenship with an emphasis on compassion and responsibility, shifting from the pursued values and goals. As the concept of competency that appeared in the 2015 curricula has been expanded to the 2022 curricula, it was found to be linked to and continuous with OECD Education 2030. In the 2022 revised curricula, it can be said that this connection was further strengthened with the emergence of the student agency and transformational capabilities of OECD Education 2030. In OECD Education 2030, competencies are placed at the center of the learning compass, surrounded by core standards including knowledge, attitudes, skills, and values, suggesting an expansion of the concept of competencies beyond mere skill and knowledge acquisition. These changes were reflected in the 2022 revised curricula, and it can be said that the competency-oriented education area has been expanded"

To achieve this, Catholic civic education should be actively utilized through various organizations and committees that engage in ecological environmental movements inside and outside the Church."
A Convergence Study on the Influence Factors of Virtual Tourism on Users' Travel Intention in the Field,2023,"['Virtual Tourism', 'Travel Intention', 'Effect of COVID-19', 'Virtual Reality Tourism Experience', 'Convergence Research']",,"At the height of COVID-19, the movement of people was severely restricted, and field travel activities were greatly affected. During this period, cloud tourism and virtual tourism have developed rapidly. Whether virtual tourism can facilitate or even replace the development of onsite tourism in the post-COIVD-19 era has become a popular research topic. This study takes virtual tourism users as the research object, adopts structural equation modeling based on the theory of planned behavior, and introduces two variables, virtual reality tourism experience and the Effect of COVID-19, to investigate the factors influencing the transformation of virtual reality tourism experience to field tourism behavior. The factors influencing the transformation of the virtual reality tourism experience to field travel behavior are studied. This study collected data from 373 valid respondents through a questionnaire. SmartPLS 4.0.0 validated the causal model, and most of the study hypotheses were supported. The results of this study show that: first, virtual reality tourism experience, perceptual behavioral control, and subjective norm can significantly affect the attitude of virtual tourism users, but only virtual reality tourism experience and virtual tourism users' attitude can directly and positively affect field travel intention in the field.First, virtual reality tourism experience, perceptual behavioral control, and subjective norm can significantly affect the attitude of virtual tourism users experience, and virtual tourism users' attitudes can directly and positively influence field travel intention in the field. Second, the virtual reality tourism experience is the most important factor facilitating the transformation of travel intention in the field. Third, the virtual reality tourist attitude has almost no mediating effect in converting the virtual reality tourism experience into travel intention in the field. Third, the Effect of COVID-19 can significantly affect virtual reality tourist attitudes but cannot promote the conversion of virtual tourism users to field travel behavioral intention. The study results help government departments and tourism companies use virtual tourism to enhance tourists' travel intention, thus recovering tourism in the post-COVID-19 era and developing related policies and services."
One-step solvothermal synthesis of poly(arylene ether nitrile) decorated magnetic composite for methylene blue adsorption from aqueous solution,2023,"['Poly(Arylene Ether Nitrile)', 'Fe3O4', 'Solvothermal Method', 'Adsorption', 'Methylene Blue']",,"A series of poly(arylene ether nitrile) containing versatile carboxyl and sulfonic groups (CSPEN) were magnetically functionalized by ferroferric oxide (Fe3O4), and the obtained magnetic adsorbents (Fe3O4/CSPEN) were used to remove methylene blue (MB) dye from aqueous solution. The systematical characterizations that including scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) certified that the Fe3O4/CSPEN possessed versatile functional groups and magnetic separation properties. The batch adsorption studies revealed that the Fe3O4/CSPEN not only displayed high selective adsorption ability for cationic MB in the presence of anionic MO, but also exhibited a removal efficiency as high as 98.2%. Besides, the adsorption kinetics and isotherm matched well with pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir model, respectively, and the maximum adsorption capacity of Fe3O4/CSPEN for MB was 92.029 mg/g. The FTIR and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analyses confirmed that the outstanding adsorption capacity of Fe3O4/CSPEN was attributed to their own microporous structure and the electrostatic interaction with MB. Therefore, the modified magnetic adsorbent can be used to selectively remove cationic dye from aqueous solution."

Spanning from 2006 to 2023, the analysis focuses on transforming conceptual UNSCRs into actionable missions assigned to the UNIFIL MTF through the UN’s Military Planning Process. The methodology involves a review of the relevant UNSCRs and a detailed mandate and implementation analysis.The study reveals a significant shift in the UNIFIL MTF’s mission, transitioning from Phase One (2006-2017), which emphasized establishing the naval presence system, to Phase Two (2018-2023), focusing on building the capacity of the Lebanese Navy. It clarifies that the MTF's initiative to reduce the number of its naval vessels, while enhancing the Lebanese Navy's capabilities, is a strategic realignment consistent with Phase Two's objectives, rather than a decrease in overall mission strength.Furthermore, this research establishes the UNIFIL MTF as a model for future maritime peacekeeping missions. It provides critical insights into translating UNSCR mandates into practical maritime operations, setting a precedent for similar future missions in the maritime domain. The study also serves as a foundational case study, highlighting the necessity of integrating legal knowledge with maritime operational and planning expertise."
Diminazene aceturate exacerbates renal fibrosis after unilateral ureteral obstruction in female mice,2023,"['Chronic kidney diseases', 'Diminazene aceturate', 'Inflammation', 'Kidney fibrosis', 'M2 macrophage']",,"Background: Diminazene aceturate (DIZE), an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activator, exerts anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects in a variety of human chronic diseases. However, the role of DIZE in kidney fibrosis and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effects of DIZE on the progression of renal fibrosis after unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), a well-established model of chronic kidney disease. Methods: C57BL/6 female or male mice were subjected to right UUO. Mice received 15 mg/kg DIZE or vehicle (saline) daily. On the 7th day after UUO, kidneys were collected for analysis of renal fibrosis (α-smooth muscle actin, phosphorylated SMAD3, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, Masson’s trichrome, and Sirius red staining), inflammation (macrophage infiltration, proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines), apoptosis/necrotic cell death (TUNEL and periodic acid-Schiff staining), and  ACE2 activity and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression.Results: Treatment with DIZE exacerbated renal fibrosis by upregulating the profibrotic TGF-β/SMAD3 pathway, proinflammatory cytokine/chemokines (interleukin [IL]-1β, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, IL-6, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2) levels, M2 macrophage accumulation (CD206, IL-4, IL-10, and CX3CL1), and apoptotic/necrotic cell death in the obstructed kidneys of female mice but not male mice. However, DIZE treatment had no effect on ACE2 activity or mRNA expression.Conclusion: DIZE exacerbates UUO-induced renal fibrosis by aggravating tubular damage, apoptosis, and inflammation through independent of Ang (1–7), Ang 2 levels, and ACE2 expression/activity, rather than protecting against renal fibrosis after UUO. DIZE also has powerful effects on recruiting macrophages, including the M2-polarized subtype, in female UUO mice."

Interest-based platforms are similar to traditional internet communities in that they allow people to share their opinions and thoughts in an anonymous internet space, but they have the following characteristics. First, they process data about individuals and their interests based on artificial intelligence and underlying technologies that can easily process big data. Second, the user's activity is directly linked to the business model of the operator. Third, in the metaversified virtual space, users have transformed into a player, not a receiver, but a consumer and a producer. These means that we can see that interest platforms are a transitional phenomenon that is transforming into a new form of social community, a metaverse, a personalized, technology-based virtual space. These features show that the discipline of this space is not easy. Some of them are private platforms that are not subject to regulation, or they delegate excessive powers to individual community moderators, resulting in excessive restrictions on users' basic rights.In recent years, platform regulation discussions have tended to focus on specific technologies and risks, such as artificial intelligence. However, since the platform order is formed from the applied technology and the entire platform ecosystem, the issue of rights protection should be approached from the perspective of ""balance"" from the influence of each stakeholder in the platform ecosystem. In practice, the regulation of platforms of interest is subject to current legal regulations and service community regulations, and varies depending on the degree of openness of the platform, the technology it supports, etc. Against this backdrop, despite the uniqueness of interest platforms, research on the protection of individual rights and public values in this context is scarce. Therefore, it is necessary to savor the socio-cultural value of interest-based platforms in recent years and review the structural changes and problems that emerge from them at the public law level.This paper defines recent personalized digital platforms as ‘interest-based platforms’ and examines the need for and direction of protection policies on such platforms in terms of expanding individual freedom rights. Furthermore, we will examine user protection policies as a self-regulatory system in response to the complexity of technological platforms, along with legal responses to aspects of risk that appear on these platforms."

Specifically, the thesis was developed by focusing on the ideological influence relationship between the Western Studies introduced by the Jesuit missionaries and the revival of Chinese literature, namely, the Practical studies trend, the scientific trend, and the documental archaeology. At that time, the introduction of Western culture, represented by Christianity, had a significant impact on the development of modern Chinese ideology, coupled with the transformation of China’s modern-oriented ideological culture itself.However, the development of Chinese culture has its own cause and inherent logic.According to the existing model of “shock-response” in Chinese studies, the perspective of interpreting the relationship between the introduction of Western studies and Chinese thought is limited. It is true that the introduction of Western studies became a catalyst for the innovation and development of Chinese ideology, but its acceptance was ultimately driven by the development of Chinese culture itself. Even if the currents in China during the Ming and Qing period collided with each other, each went through their own interpretive dimension when absorbing Western studies. Only in the interaction between the change of consciousness in mainland China and foreign Western studies can we rationally explain the influence of Western studies on Chinese thought at the time and their actions. Research in this field will provide a useful knowledge base for the progress of research in the field of Korean studies, such as Western studies and Practical studies in Korea, and the formation of an early modern or modern knowledge society in Korea."

In particular, it examines the nature of Automatic Society based on digital information technology and the conditions of human life from the perspective of French technology philosophers Simondon and Stiegler. Based on this, the article reveals the importance of liberal arts education as a new life ‘ars’ in the post-labor society that will come with artificial intelligence. Simondon's technical mentality and technical culture reveal a new model of post-labor existence that enables people to organize their work and public activities alongside AI, rather than in competition with it. Stiegler embodies Simondon's outlook by calling for a transformation of the crisis of labor and spirit caused by the algorithmic governmentality of Automatic Society into an opportunity for the invention of new kind of knowledge and work. The era of intelligent automation shifts the paradigm of life from labor productivity and expertise to post-labor and liberal arts. We need to cultivate life ‘ars’ so that the time freed from labor due to automation can be used to take care of our own lives and the lives of others, inherit our cultural traditions, and produce new values. Liberal arts education should move toward fostering digital literacy with a humanistic outlook in order for us to understand the human condition of living in an automated technological environment and to discover the value of the human spirit and the meaning of human life."
Named Entity Recognition in Electronic Health Records: A Methodological Review,2023,"['Clinical Decision Support System', 'Electronic Health Records', 'Deep Learning', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Supervised Machine Learning']",,"Objectives: A substantial portion of the data contained in Electronic Health Records (EHR) is unstructured, often appearingas free text. This format restricts its potential utility in clinical decision-making. Named entity recognition (NER) methodsaddress the challenge of extracting pertinent information from unstructured text. The aim of this study was to outline thecurrent NER methods and trace their evolution from 2011 to 2022. Methods: We conducted a methodological literature reviewof NER methods, with a focus on distinguishing the classification models, the types of tagging systems, and the languagesemployed in various corpora. Results: Several methods have been documented for automatically extracting relevant informationfrom EHRs using natural language processing techniques such as NER and relation extraction (RE). These methodscan automatically extract concepts, events, attributes, and other data, as well as the relationships between them. Most NERstudies conducted thus far have utilized corpora in English or Chinese. Additionally, the bidirectional encoder representationfrom transformers using the BIO tagging system architecture is the most frequently reported classification scheme. Wediscovered a limited number of papers on the implementation of NER or RE tasks in EHRs within a specific clinical domain.Conclusions: EHRs play a pivotal role in gathering clinical information and could serve as the primary source for automatedclinical decision support systems. However, the creation of new corpora from EHRs in specific clinical domains is essential tofacilitate the swift development of NER and RE models applied to EHRs for use in clinical practice."

Non-contact oxygen saturation monitoring for wound healing process using dual-wavelength simultaneous acquisition imaging system,2023,"['Photoplethysmography', 'Non-contact measurement', 'Camera-based', 'Oxygen saturation', 'Wound healing']",,"Here we report the fabrication of a noncontact pulse oximeter system based on a dual-wavelength imaging system and itsoxygen saturation monitoring performance during wound healing. The dual-wavelength imaging system consists of 660 nmand 940 nm light-emitting diodes and a multi-spectral camera that simultaneously accepts visible and near-infrared images.Using the proposed system, images were acquired at 30 fps at both wavelengths, and photoplethysmography signals wereextracted by specifying a specific region in the images. We removed the signals caused by small movements and smoothedthem using the discrete wavelet transform and moving average filter. To confirm the feasibility of the proposed noncontactoxygen saturation system, a wound model was created using a hairless mouse and oxygen saturation was measured duringwound healing. The measured values were compared and analyzed using a reflective animal pulse oximeter. Through acomparative analysis of these two devices, the error of the proposed system was evaluated and the possibility of its clinicalapplication and wound healing monitoring through oxygen saturation measurement confirmed."
Analysis of the Parameters Affecting the Efficiency of the Wireless Power Transmission System Designed for New Generation Electric Vehicles,2023,"['Wireless power transfer (WPT)', 'Coupling factor', 'ANSYS-Maxwell', 'Efficiency']",,"In magnetic resonance coupled wireless power transfer (WPT) systems, parameters were investigated in the WPT system to ensure maximum power transfer under the conditions of changing the distance between the receive coil and the transmit coil. When the distance between the transceiver coils is changed, the inductances of the system and the coupling coefficient for maximum power transfer were calculated with Maxwell-3D, which performed a solution based on the finite element method (FEM). In addition, the effect of the distance variation between the transmitter and receiver coils, the coupling coefficient (k) values, on the input inductance and power transmission was investigated. In the model developed in the ANSYS-Maxwell environment, it has been observed that the variation of the input inductance depending on the distance and therefore the common inductance between the transmitter and receiver coils can be analyzed. In addition, the effect of the coupling factor (k) on the WPT system has also been demonstrated. It has been shown that maximum power transfer can be sustained in WPT systems where the distance between the receive coil and the transmit coil varies within certain limits. Finally, the efficiency of the transformer for a close distance between the coils was also tested experimentally."
Methylene blue adsorption by wheat straw-based adsorbents: Study of adsorption kinetics and isotherms,2023,"['Adsorption', 'Dye Removal', 'Water Treatment', 'Wheat Straw', 'Methylene Blue']",,"Dyes are one of the major toxic pollutants discharged in large quantities into the hydrosphere. Among various dye removal methods, adsorption has a distinct position. In this study, wheat straw was used as a low-cost and renewable material to prepare two economical adsorbents through the facile production method. An adsorbent was prepared by alkaline hydrolysis of wheat straw. Then, another adsorbent was synthesized by carboxymethylation of the first adsorbent. The prepared adsorbents were characterized by various techniques, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). A series of adsorption experiments were conducted in a batch adsorption system to study the effect of diverse parameters, such as solution pH, the initial dye concentration, and contact time, on the adsorption performance. Adsorption models and kinetic results indicated that the adsorption of methylene blue onto both adsorbents was more fitted to Langmuir isotherm and followed second-order kinetics. The maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of methylene blue on alkaline-modified wheat straw and carboxymethylated modified wheat straw reached 131.123 and 191.427 mg/g, respectively. Regarding their low cost and suitable adsorption potential, they can be cost-effective and promising adsorbents for wastewater treatment."
Activated carbon modified by Mo-doped CQDs: An efficient method to reduce the thermal hazard in toluene adsorption,2023,['Carbon quantum dots Activated carbon Modification Thermostability Thermal safety'],,"Activated carbon (AC) is one of the typical adsorbents for industrial treatment of VOCs, but AC itself has ahigh calorific value. When the heat generated by low-temperature oxidation cannot be released, it is easyto store heat and oxidize spontaneously, resulting in immeasurable harm. Therefore, it is important tostudy and improve the thermal stability of AC. In this study, Mo-doped carbon quantum dots (CQDs)was synthesized to enhance the safety of AC usage. The structure of AC before and after modificationwas characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy(FT-IR) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD). On the modified Mo-doped CQDs/AC, there are more crystallinestructures formed by Mo oxides on the surface, which makes the intermolecular force on the surface ofAC increase. At the same time, Mo oxide has strong oxidation resistance, which can inhibit the thermaldecomposition process of AC, and has stronger stability. The spontaneous combustion tendency and thermalhazard of AC before and after modification were greatly improved. The heat released in the tolueneadsorption by the modified AC at different temperatures was significantly lower than the heat released bythe unmodified AC. According to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, the adsorption performance of ModopedCQDs (2.5 wt%) was 1.6 times higher than that of AC when the system was 25 C. The resultsshowed that Na2MoO4 CQDs modified AC could effectively improve the thermal stability and greatlyreduce the spontaneous combustion tendency. A relative fire safety performance evaluation model wasalso established to comprehensively evaluate the fire risk of VOCs treatment by AC."

Extending the reaches of composition with chromaticism, microtonal, and modal inflections, he built diversity by using language that was also easily transformable in his expression style. In particular, he absorbed Romanian folk melody and rhythmic features into traditional forms such as sonata form, cyclic thematic structure, and motivic development.

One is Ulrich Beck’s theory of emancipatory catastrophism, and the other is Bruno Latour’s political ecology, founded on the figure of Gaia. Having shown his interest in the ecological crisis of modernity in light of the thesis of risk society, Beck proposed to regard the actual climate problem and the Anthropocene not as a mere crisis but as a catastrophe and also to find out the way of transforming the problem into the emancipatory moment of creating new institutions. As for Latour, who invented ANT in the field of STS and criticized the modern constitution, he attempted to tackle the problem of what he calls ‘the New Climate Regime’ drawing on Gaia’s hypothesis. He proposed to see Gaia as a critical zone. In the same vein, he considered the war model a possibility to escape the actual Anthropocenic catastrophe, while the ecological classes shouldered the subjectivity of this task. These two examples exhibit the impact of the Anthropocene discourses on social theory. They assert that 21st-century social theory should think deeply about disaster, destruction, and catastrophe instead of development, prosperity, and progress."

The purpose of this paper is to uncover the narrative strategies of the local film director considering the global content market called YouTube and its consumer behavior through this comparative analysis. In order to compare and analyze how the theme and core narrative of <RRR>, a feature film featuring numerous characters, was transformed and captured in a 4-minute music video centered on the dance of the two male protagonists, Greimas’ structuralist semiotic theory was applied. In the process of compression from <RRR> to <Naatu-Naatu>, the composition of the characters and the actor model were creatively transformed, but the core element that appears repeatedly in both and constitutes deep meaning was the same in that it was ‘victory.’ The reason why the YouTube music video <Naatu Naatu> was able to gain global popularity over the feature film <RRR> while conveying the same in-depth meaning is that the movie <RRR> exaggerated the superiority of Indian heroes over the British, but <Naatu-Naatu> focused on the victory of the weak over the strong through a story simplified to entertainment and dance competitions."

Internet articles related to tax policy are easily accessible to anyone, and opinions can be freely expressed in comments. Therefore, it can be regarded that the comments on the article represent public opinion on the policy. In this study, based on text data collected by surveys through random sampling, we train a transformer model to build a sentiment analyzer that can classify positive/negative opinions on the new income tax policy on cryptocurrency and obtain the positive/negative ratio for the comments. As a result, we find that the rate of negative opinions in the policy responses to the comments on the articles was 80 to 90% of the total comments. It can be seen that this shows a considerable level of bias compared to the negative rate of about 30% of the open-ended survey through random sampling. The results shed light on the process of collecting public responses to government policies such as tax policies for determining whether or not to accept comments on articles as evidence of public opinion."

They involve reciprocal presupposition of notions such as part/whole, individual/society, gift/commodity, nature/culture, and human/nonhuman. Through examining these multidimensional poles, this article will discuss the transformations of conventional epistemological terms and the counter-invented figures of the “other” relational forms. Taking three models of the object and the relation or the multiple as provisional introduction points to the discussion, it redefines the concept of “exchange” through the paradoxical exchanges that such differences of perspective engender and examines the turn towards the concept of “change-exchange” as ex-change that is already transformation, with/in the operation of anonymous networks.

This study explored how users perceive subversive basic fashion in social media videos, by examining the associated concepts and characteristics. In addition, the factors contributing to the style's social media dissemination were identified and its distinctive features were analyzed. Through text mining analysis, 80 keywords were selected for semantic network and CONCOR analysis. TF-IDF and N-gram results indicate that subversive basic fashion involves transformative design techniques such as cutting or layering garments, emphasizing the body with thin fabrics, and creating bold visual effects. Topic modeling suggests that this fashion forms a subculture that resists mainstream norms, seeking individuality by creatively transforming the existing garments. CONCOR analysis categorized the style into six groups: forward-thinking unconventional fashion, bold and unique style, creative reworking, item utilization and combination, pursuit of easy and convenient fashion, and contemporary sensibility. Consumer actions, linked to social media, were shown to involve easily transforming and pursuing personalized styles. Furthermore, creating new styles through the existing clothing is seen as an economic and creative activity that fosters network formation and interaction. This study is significant as it addresses language expression limitations and subjectivity issues in fashion image analysis, revealing factors contributing to content reproduction through user-perceived design concepts and social media-conveyed fashion characteristics."
Task offloading under deterministic demand for vehicular edge computing,2023,"['delay', 'task offloading', 'vehicle edge computing', 'wireless network']",,"In vehicular edge computing (VEC) networks, the rapid expansion of intelligent transportation and the corresponding enormous numbers of tasks bring stringent requirements on timely task offloading. However, many tasks typically appear within a short period rather than arriving simultaneously, which makes it difficult to realize effective and efficient resource scheduling. In addition, some key information about tasks could be learned due to the regular data collection and uploading processes of sensors, which may contribute to developing effective offloading strategies. Thus, in this paper, we propose a model that considers the deterministic demand of multiple tasks. It is possible to generate effective resource reservations or early preparation decisions in offloading strategies if some feature information of the deterministic demand can be obtained in advance. We formulate our scenario as a 0-1 programming problem to minimize the average delay of tasks and transform it into a convex form. Finally, we proposed an efficient optimal offloading algorithm that uses the interior point method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has great advantages in optimizing offloading utility."

Efforts to excavate disease resistance traits of cruciferous crops against Alternaria black spots or blights have been demonstrated. Genetic resource of disease resistance was investigated in the wild relatives of cruciferous crops, and different cultivars were screened under different inoculation conditions. Development of the disease-resistant lines against Alternaria black spots or blights was also tried via genetic transformation of the cruciferous crops using diverse plant defence-associated genes. Plant immunity activated by pre-treatment with chemicals, i. e. β-amino-n-butyric acid and melatonin, was suggested for reducing Alternaria black spots or blights in cruciferous crops. The disease resistance traits have also been evaluated in model plant Arabidopsis originating from different habitats.

Through theoretical sampling, Seven coaches who are in charge of the special school sports teams, belonging to the special school were selected as participants of the study. As a result, by applying the grounded theory method of Strauss and Corbin (1990), concept derivation and paradigm were constructed, and a circumstantial model was developed. As a result of open coding, 155 concepts were derived. This was again composed of 49 subcategories, which were finally categorized into 15 upper categories. First, as a result of applying the training process and experience of the sports team coach of a special school to the paradigm model, the focal phenomena was derived as 'difficult operation of the sports team in special schools'. The categories of causal conditions were identified as 'management of neglected disability students' and 'difficulty in selecting athletes', and contextual conditions were derived from 'recognition of special school sports teams' and 'restrictions of surrounding environment'. The intervening conditions, which is the role of promoting the strategic action/interaction, was derived from 'cultivation of coach expertise', 'collaboration in the surrounding area', and 'mindfulness'. 'Efforts' and 'Role of Transformation Education' were derived. As a consequences, ‘performance’, ‘reward’, ‘limits felt by coaches’, ‘necessity of a system for fostering disabled students and athletes’, and ‘necessity of special school sports teams’ were derived. This analysis process derived a key category as a 'nurturing disabled student athletes in difficult environments' was presented. Based on the results of the analysis, the discussion suggested the difficulties experienced during the operation of the sports teams of special schools, the efforts of the sports coaches of special schools, and the direction of nurturing athletes with disabilities."

They cause loss of vegetation and affect ecosystem changes depending on their intensityand occurrence. Ecosystem changes, in turn, affect wildfire occurrence, causing secondary damage. Thus,accurate estimation of the areas affected by wildfires is fundamental. Satellite remote sensing is used forforest fire detection because it can rapidly acquire topographic and meteorological information aboutthe affected area after forest fires. In addition, deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neuralnetworks (CNN) and transformer models show high performance for more accurate monitoring of fireburntregions. To date, the application of deep learning models has been limited, and there is a scarcityof reports providing quantitative performance evaluations for practical field utilization. Hence, this studyemphasizes a comparative analysis, exploring performance enhancements achieved through both modelselection and data design. This study examined deep learning models for detecting wildfire-damagedareas using Landsat 8 satellite images in California. Also, we conducted a comprehensive comparisonand analysis of the detection performance of multiple models, such as U-Net and High-ResolutionNetwork-Object Contextual Representation (HRNet-OCR). Wildfire-related spectral indices such asnormalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized burn ratio (NBR) were used as inputchannels for the deep learning models to reflect the degree of vegetation cover and surface moisturecontent. As a result, the mean intersection over union (mIoU) was 0.831 for U-Net and 0.848 for HRNet-OCR, showing high segmentation performance. The inclusion of spectral indices alongside the base wavelength bands resulted in increased metric values for all combinations, affirming that the augmentationof input data with spectral indices contributes to the refinement of pixels. This study can be applied toother satellite images to build a recovery strategy for fire-burnt areas."

从 “控制” 到 “支持”:中国生育政策变迁与执行变化,2023,"['中国', '生育政策', '计划生育', '生育支持', 'China', 'Fertility Policy', 'Family Planning', 'Fertility Support']",,"As a pivotal component of China's national strategy, the country's reproductive policy plays a paramount role in the demographic transition and socio-economic development. The protracted implementation of the family planning policy facilitated a swift transition towards a demographic scenario characterized by low birth rates, low mortality rates, and subdued natural population growth. However, it also precipitated challenges such as diminished fertility rates and an aging population. Presently, with the liberalization of the “three-child policy”, China's reproductive strategy has undergone a transformation from “control” to “support”. This article, tracing the historical continuum, retrospects China's reproductive policies from the founding of the nation in 1949 to the present. Focusing particularly on three facets of the policy implementation mechanism—policy objectives, organizational management, and the executional content and means—it conducts an in-depth analysis of the policy implementation during the era of family planning. Simultaneously, it delves into the current state of China's reproductive support system. The article contends that, in tandem with shifts in demographic dynamics and population policies, there is a substantive transformation in China's reproductive policy execution paradigm. From the standpoint of policy objectives, the current population strategy has shifted towards addressing the challenges posed by low fertility. Concerning organizational structure, the traditional top-down management model persists, yet local governments now wield enhanced leadership authority. In terms of executional content and means, erstwhile constraints from the family planning era have been dismantled, although the nascent reproductive support system is still under construction, necessitating the design and establishment of institutional frameworks."

Since the 1990s, social exclusion has largely been a result of a specific system of capital accumulation created by the spread of neoliberalism, however, the social phenomenon had existed even before the rise of neoliberalism.This study employs Agamben's concept of inclusive exclusion to explore the nature of social exclusion, then goes on to show how disabled people’s situation in capitalist societies fundamentally takes the form of inclusive exclusion based on the social model of disability and the concept of disablement proposed by critical disability studies. In particular, this study highlights how disablement is the process through which vulnerability is transformed into disability (as in, being incapable) in the presence of specific social conditions. Next, it is argued that the counter-hegemonic knowledge produced by disability movements has transformed the concept of disablement into a universal political knowledge that goes beyond the personal experiences of disabled people and is capable of analyzing social exclusion in general, and that disability movements are political processes of liberation based on solidarity against dominant powers that convert vulnerability to disability. Lastly, the conclusion summarizes the paper and suggests the implications of disability movements as a politics of human rights."

Although Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in reducing rural poverty, rural employment generation has still become a major concern for development thinkers. In this regard, rural tourism could play a vital role in rural employment generation in Bangladesh. Rural tourism, although promising, lacks significant attention in policy-making within Bangladesh. There remains a discernible absence of emphasis on rural tourism within national tourism policies. Learning from successful models in various Asian countries such as Malaysia, India, China, and Nepal, this study examines the transformative roles played by rural tourism in boosting local economies and generating employment opportunities. Insights are derived from these models, emphasizing the socio-economic impacts of rural tourism, including income generation, employment prospects, and poverty reduction. Through a review of existing literature and practical observations, the study underscores the conceptual dimensions of rural tourism, defining it as a movement from urban to rural settings for the purpose of experiencing nature, culture, and rural life. The study discusses potential roles and strategies for promoting the integration of rural tourism into Bangladesh's development paradigm, focusing on infrastructural development, agro-tourism linkages, and community involvement in rural tourism initiatives. Furthermore, the study highlights the economic benefits of rural tourism, including infrastructure enhancement, agricultural connections, and the ‘My Village My Town’ approach. This approach aims to bring urban facilities to rural areas while preserving local culture and heritage. The research examines the best practices and successful case studies from various Asian countries, showcasing the significant contributions of rural tourism to economic growth, community development, and employment generation. In conclusion, the study emphasizes the immense potential of rural tourism as a catalyst for rural development in Bangladesh. It proposes strategies to harness this potential, stressing the importance of community participation, infrastructural development, and government support as critical elements for a successful rural tourism framework. Overall, this research aims to shed light on the largely untapped potential of rural tourism in Bangladesh and provides recommendations for leveraging this sector for economic growth and community development in rural areas."

In ""Objectification""(1995), Nussbaum criticizes the fact that objectification has been regarded as negative term in previous feminist work, arguing that positive objectification is possible when it is accompanied by respect for the other as a person. This article will show that Nussbaum's discussion of objectification suffers from a problem of 'arbitrariness' and offer a new way to reflect on the issue of objectification based on Sartre's model of relationship for others. Nussbaum's ""positive objectification"" has a fundamentally arbitrary status in that the other may or may not be treated as a person, depending on the subject's intentions, and there is always room for violence to intrude into the relationship. For Sartre, on the other hand, the transformation of the other into a subject from an object is not something that can be left to one's arbitrary choice. Rather, the gaze of the other forms the limit of my subjectivity. Through Sartre's philosophy, we can see that feminist discussions of objectification are based on false notions of the other and the subject, and we can find new ways to think about the problem of objectification."

Early and precise diagnosis is crucial, and clinical outcomes can be markedly enhanced. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has ushered in a new era, notably in image analysis, paving the way for major advancements in breast cancer diagnosis and individualized treatment regimens. In the diagnostic workflow for patients with breast cancer, the role of AI encompasses screening, diagnosis, staging, biomarker evaluation, prognostication, and therapeutic response prediction. Although its potential is immense, its complete integration into clinical practice is challenging. Particularly, these challenges include the imperatives for extensive clinical validation, model generalizability, navigating the “black-box” conundrum, and pragmatic considerations of embedding AI into everyday clinical environments. In this review, we comprehensively explored the diverse applications of AI in breast cancer care, underlining its transformative promise and existing impediments. In radiology, we specifically address AI in mammography, tomosynthesis, risk prediction models, and supplementary imaging methods, including magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound. In pathology, our focus is on AI applications for pathologic diagnosis, evaluation of biomarkers, and predictions related to genetic alterations, treatment response, and prognosis in the context of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. Our discussion underscores the transformative potential of AI in breast cancer management and emphasizes the importance of focused research to realize the full spectrum of benefits of AI in patient care."

To accurately estimate the location in the shaded area, the accumulated position error must be compensated with information obtained from a separate sensor. When a monocular camera is selected as an additional sensor, the process of measuring the relative distance after detecting objects in a tunnel should be performed before using these data as an indicator. This paper presents a modified inverse perspective transformation model that projects image pixels to the plane parallel to the ground. The image pixels are projected to the plane accounting for the distance and the height of the facility in the tunnel. Then, through the transformation model, the distance of the facility in the tunnel can be measured using a single camera sensor. The Samsungsan Tunnel located on National Highway 110 in South Korea was chosen for the experiment. The estimated distance results by the proposed method were compared with the LiDAR measurements obtained real-time time by computing the position errors for the longitudinal and lateral directions, separately. This study demonstrates the possibility of estimating a distance with only a monocular camera for precise positioning even in a tunnel."

Among various stakeholders who exert legitimacy pressure on companies, the media is one of the most influential, especially in the early stages of the institutionalization process, when sustainability management is being established as a social institution. If the media exerts legitimacy pressure on companies, this is in line with the media's primary accountability, the role of a watchdog for the power group. In particular, as shareholder capitalism transforms into stakeholder capitalism, the media’s role of a watchdog for companies is expressed in the form of legitimacy pressure. In an attempt to explore whether the media properly serves as a watchdog so that legitimacy pressure on companies can work effectively, this study aims to analyze the themes and tone of sustainable management news articles. For the purpose of the study, 20,000 news articles on sustainable management from 2015 to 2020 were collected through the Big Kinds, a news database of the Korea Press Foundation. Using Python, an open-source programming language widely used for text mining, this study analyzed the overall semantic structure, associative words of core concepts, specific topics, and overall tones in the collected news articles. After cleaning the data with KoNLPy, a Python package for Korean natural language processing, this study applied semantic network analysis (SNA), word embedding, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis using various Python libraries. According to the result of SNA, the overall semantic structure of the sustainable management news articles emphasized that the company received good reviews externally for practicing sustainable management that fulfills its economic, social, and environmental responsibilities. The word embedding results suggested that the association of core concepts such as ‘sustainable management’ or ‘corporate’ was mainly in the context of report publication for external evaluation. As a result of topic modeling analysis, the five topics contained in the news articles were 'industry grand-prix award', 'announcement of good evaluation', 'group chairman innovation', 'global environmental technology', and 'regional business support'. Sentiment analysis results showed that the overall reporting attitude of sustainable management news articles was slightly positive. As a result of analyzing the themes and tone of sustainable management news articles from various angles using various text mining techniques, it is hard to say that the media has properly played the watchdog role. This is because sustainable management news articles were used only as a corporate vehicle for symbolic legitimation, and did not properly capture the voices of stakeholders who expect and demand corporate legitimacy. As implications for the study, it was discussed that when the media strengthens its watchdog role and effectively exerts legitimacy pressure on companies, the credibility of the media can be restored as well as the global competitiveness of Korean companies can be improved."
현대 불교 공동체의 성공적인 대중화 전략: 재가자 중심 불교 공동체 ‘정토회’를 중심으로,2023,"['Jungto-Society', 'Buddhism', 'Popularization Strategy', 'a Lay Practitioners', 'Practice Community', 'Social Participation', '정토회', '재가자', '불교', '수행공동체', '대중화 전략', '사회참여']","본 연구는 한국사회에서 빠른 속도로 성장한 재가자 중심의 불교 수행공동체인 ‘정토회’의 성공적인 대중화 전략과 그 특징을 분석한 것이다.근대의 급격한 정치, 경제적 변동 속에서 한국불교 공동체는 대중화의 길을 모색해 왔고, 그 포교 방법 역시 다양화하였다. 불교계는 민주화와신사회운동이 확산되던 1980년대 이후부터 과거의 소극적 포교에서 벗어나 사회참여운동을 통한 적극적인 포교를 전개했다. 그럼에도 불구하고 대중의 불교를 비롯한 타종교 제반에 대한 부정적 인식과 무관심은 해가 갈수록 증가하였으며, 2019년에 발생한 COVID-19 팬데믹은 모든 종교의 신자 수를 급격히 감소시키는 결과를 초래했다. 이에 따라 종교계는 기존의 관행에 대해 반성하고 선교 및 포교 방식에 대해 성찰해야 하는 시기에 직면하게 되었다. 지금까지와는 다른 새로운 방법을 모색해야만 하는 지점에 도달한 것이다. 이러한 상황에서 COVID-19 이전부터 이미 포교 방법의 다양화를 실천함으로써 성장해 온 ‘정토회’는 포교의 측면에서 새로운 모델의 불교 수행공동체로서 주목받고 있다.정토회는 지난 30년 동안 지도 법사 ‘법륜’과 재가자들이 함께 성장시킨 불교 수행공동체로서 기존의 포교 방법과는 다른 시도로써 불법을 전파해 왔다. 본 연구에서는 정토회가 한국사회에서 빠르게 성장할 수 있었던 이유로 첫째, 현대인들이 필요로 하는 실존적 상황을 충족하는 콘텐츠 개발과 사회 교육적 측면의 수행, 둘째, 재가자를 중심의 한 조직 운영 및 교육과 다양한 내용의 사회참여 활동, 셋째, 지도 법사의 방향설정 능력 및 활동력에 기반한 조직의 구심점 확립에 있는 것으로 파악하였다. 정토회는 수행자 중심의 산속 불교를 일반 대중들의 접근성을높일 수 있는 도심 속 생활 불교로 끌어와 재가자 중심 공동체의 모습을 지향하였고 또한 추상적이고 관념적인 불교 교학의 가르침을 생활세계 속에서 실천할 수 있는 구체적인 지침으로 전환시키는 노력을 해온 것으로 보인다.본 연구에서 살핀 ‘정토회’의 대중화 전략은 불교를 비롯한 타종교의 포교 및 선교에 대한 지혜를 제공하며, 나아가 오늘날 한국인의 실존적 상황과 종교에 기대하는 바를 살필 수 있다는 데 그 의의가 있을 것이다.","This study analyzes the strategies of Jungto-Society, a practitioner-centered Buddhist community that has witnessed rapid growth in South Korean society, in effectively popularizing its teachings.Against the backdrop of rapid political and economic changes in modern times, Buddhist communities in South Korea have sought avenues for popularization and diversified their outreach methods. Starting in the 1980s, with the spread of democratization and new social movements, the Buddhist community shifted from passive outreach to active outreach through social participation movements. However, negative perceptions and lack of interest toward all religions, including Buddhism, have been on the rise, and the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019 led to a sharp decline in followers across all religions. In response, religious groups engaged in deep reflection on their existing missionary and outreach methods, recognizing the need for new approaches. It is in this context that Jungto-Society has gained attention as a community for Buddhist practice that has grown by diversifying its outreach methods to suit the times.Over the past 30 years, Jungto-Society, a Buddhist practice community that has grown under the guidance of Master Pomnyun(法輪) and lay practitioners, has been spreading Buddhist teachings using approaches that differ from traditional outreach methods. This study identifies the main factors for Jungto-Society’s rapid growth in South Korean society: first, it is attributed to the development of content that satisfies the practical situations needed by modern individuals, along with the performance of social-educational aspects; second, it involves the operation of an organization centered around family members and various forms of social participation activities; and third, it is understood to be rooted in the establishment of the organization’s focal point based on the direction-setting abilities and initiative of the guiding master.Jungto Society has transformed mountain Buddhism, which is centered on monastic practitioners, into a community centered on laypeople by making it accessible to the general public as an everyday practice.Jungto-Society has endeavored to convert the abstract and conceptual teachings of Buddhism into practical guidelines applicable to everyday life.The successful popularization strategies of Jungto-Society explored in this study offer insights into the outreach and missionary activities of Buddhism and other religions, further contributing to a deeper understanding of the existential state of modern individuals and their expectations from religion."

The dragon was established according to the influence of the five emperor gods [五帝] and five spirits [五靈] of the Five Elements [五行] theory during the Warring States period, and was worshiped as the Five Dragon God. During the Tang Dynasty, private dragon ancestral rites were officially recognized and incorporated into official proper ritual [正祀], while the king’s titles were conferred thereby. The state tried to unite the local people and control the order of rural villages by incorporating the model of dragon faith into the village beliefs. This is the reason as to why the various forms of dragon faith prevalent across various places have been adjusted to a unified deity called ‘Five Dragon God.’ The five dragon ancestral rites of the Song Dynasty were strengthened and elevated from little sacrifice [小祀] to middle ceremonies [中祀], and the Five Dragon God was widely worshiped as a god of the sea who protects the safety of navigation. However, in the Southern Song Dynasty, the ‘Majo’ Goddess came to hold the status of a sea god surpassing that of dragon god, which is identified as a factor that influenced the composition of the shrine of the Five Dragons Shrine in Gunsando Island of the Goryeo Dynasty. Now, at the upper building of the Five Dragons Shrine in Seonyu Island, there is a story of an old woman named Lim who was destined to become a queen yet who married into an ordinary family and died at the Five Dragons Shrine. This goddess is believed to have been a sea god introduced to Gunsando Island after the end of the Northern Song Dynasty and the beginning of the Southern Song Dynasty when the worship of the dragon in China slowed down and Mazu began to take over its role. Since the 13th century, Gunsando Island has been neglected as an empty island after suffering from the invasions by the Mongols, plundering by the Japanese pirates, and the Japanese invasion of Korea in 1592. It was only during or after the late Joseon Dynasty that people migrated to the Gogunsan area, and the existing Five Dragons Shrine operated again. In this process, the Five Dragon God, worshiped by the Chinese people and repeatedly cultivated at the national level, was adapted, and the Mazu Goddess was also determined to have been transformed [changed] into the old woman Lim, who was destined to become the queen, simply by fragmentary memories of ‘林氏’ and ‘妃’."
Theoretical Perspectives on School-based Language Teacher Development through Analyzing Cases in Other Countries,2023,"['school-based teacher development', 'teacher learning community', 'leadership', '학교중심 교사개발', '교사학습공동체', '리더십']",,"The present paper reviews the literature of teacher professional development to make underlying assumptions for school-based language teacher development (SBTD) programs. The analysis of cases in Chile, Spain and Canada illustrates SBTD in specific contexts and provides the theoretical basis from which generalizations are drawn for successful implementation of SBTD in other contexts. The content focus for professional development in the cases varies, as does the educational level, but the lessons learnt from each have wider applicability for school-based teacher development in language teaching contexts. Based on the lessons, it is asserted that SBTD enables the dynamic interaction between the teacher and their teaching context. This embodies a more effective model for professional development, especially in the field of English language teaching, where traditional development programs often overlook classroom realities and lack a school-based component. The review underscores characteristics of successful SBTD programs, which may inform ELT professional development programs: stakeholders’ involvement, trust building, collaborative and egalitarian ways of working, time and space for collaborative work, process documentation, supportive leadership, change in the school as a social organization, and professional reflection. The paper concludes that SBTD is a conduit for transforming the school into a learning environment for teachers, fostering professional growth, and consequently enhancing student achievement."

This program combined the project approach model and the early childhood engineering design process model to the teaching-learning stages: the exploration stage of topic selection and grasping prior experience, the design stage of problem solution exploration, the trial stage, the solution stage, and the problem-solving process sharing stage. Based on the analysis of collected data, the exploring, operating, and constructing the car and the opportunity to transform it into a new structure brought positive changes in young children’s scientific inquiry ability, mathematical problem-solving ability, and creativity. These results suggest the engineering-focused STEAM program as one of the models for fostering creative-convergence talents and provides data for developing a curriculum to operate an engineering-focused STEAM program in early childhood care and education."
Sustainable 3D printing with recycled materials: a review,2023,['· Additive manufacturing · 3D printing · Recycled materials · Sustainability'],,"Combining recycling and additive manufacturing (AM) can bring significant environmental and economic advantages. Using recycled materials can help reduce waste and the need for virgin materials, which can be resource-intensive to extract and process. Recycling is also more energy-efficient than extracting and processing virgin materials. This paper reviews and discusses the current trends and limitations of using recycled materials for AM, an essential step toward a more sustainable manufacturing process. Specifically, this paper reviews the research on waste materials transformed into resins for stereolithography (SLA), digital light projection (DLP) printers, filaments for fused deposition modeling (FDM), as well as metal powders for selective laser melting (SLM) and selective laser sintering (SLS) printing processes. The goal is to provide an overview of the recycled materials used in AM, their recycling methods, and the mechanical and thermal properties of the resulting materials and manufactured parts. The paper also discusses potential improvements in the process and areas for future research."
Investigation on generating spherical gear with imaginary spherical cutter,2023,['· Spherical gear · Imaginary cutter · Generating'],,"In this study, an imaginary spherical cutter with a straight edge was developed and used to create a spherical gear pair. First, the mathematical equation of the imaginary spherical cutter with a straight edge is established. A mathematical software package was used to display the imaginary spherical cutter. The coordinate systems relationship between the spherical gear pairs and the imaginary spherical cutter was defined. The equations of the family of the imaginary cutter surfaces were obtained by using the homogeneous coordinate transformation matrix, and a mathematical model of the spherical gear pair was created according to the theory of gearing. Using tooth contact analysis and assembly errors, the effect of assembly errors on the transmission errors of the spherical gear pairs was discussed. Through a finite element analysis software, the contact models under assembly errors were performed, and the contact stress distribution of the tooth surfaces under assembly errors was observed. As a result, the spherical gear pair was most sensitive to the assembly error of the center distance. It is the least sensitive to the vertical deviation angle of the misalignment assembly error."
"CNN–SVM Based Fault Detection, Classification and Location of Multi-terminal VSC–HVDC System",2023,"['HVDC transmission', 'DC fault', 'Fault detection', 'Fault location', 'Voltage source converters', 'Convolutional neural networks', 'Support vector machine']",,"Offshore wind farms (OWF) are emerging steadily throughout the previous decade due to the steady growth in electricity demand. A high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission network based on voltage source converters (VSC) is an inexpensive solution for long-distance large power transmission that is suitable to link OWF to an alternating current network. In VSC based multi-terminal HVDC systems, DC fault protection is a considerable difficult. To increase the reliability of system protection, fault detection, classification, and location identifications are essential. This keeps electrical systems functioning properly continuously and reduce economic losses, but it might be difficult. To overcome these challenges, this study proposed a computational efficient integrated convolutional neural network–support vector machine (CNN–SVM) approach model while preserving the accuracy. In this paper, the Hilbert–Huang transform (HHT) is used to extracts a feature from current signals. Next, the proposed SVM–CNN algorithm detects, classifies, and computes the fault's location in multi-terminal VSC-based HVDC systems within 2 ms. The simulations were performed using the MATLAB R2019b software. To improve the reliability of system protection, the performance evaluation of the proposed CNN–SVM model includes a comparison with prior-art techniques such as SVM, ANN, and RNN. The simulation results demonstrate that this proposed strategy can identify, classify and locate the VSC–HVDC transmission system DC faults in multiple fault circumstances with high speed and accuracy. The experimental findings reveal that the proposed approach achieves a better fault classification accuracy range of 99.87% within 2 ms. The accuracy of the proposed technique is 0.03%, 0.022%, and 0.03% of higher than existing ANN, SVM, RNN techniques, respectively."

Integration of Multi-scale CAM and Attention for Weakly Supervised Defects Localization on Surface Defective Apple,2023,"['WSOL', 'multi-scale CAM', 'attention', 'Surface defective apple']",,"Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) is a task of localizing an object in an image using only image-level labels. Previous studies have followed the conventional class activation mapping (CAM) pipeline. However, we reveal the current CAM approach suffers from problems which cause original CAM could not capture the complete defects features. This work utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) pretrained on image-level labels to generate class activation maps in a multi-scale manner to highlight discriminative regions. Additionally, a vision transformer (ViT) pretrained was treated to produce multi-head attention maps as an auxiliary detector. By integrating the CNN-based CAMs and attention maps, our approach localizes defective regions without requiring bounding box or pixel-level supervision during training. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of apple images with only image-level labels of defect categories. Experiments demonstrate our proposed method aligns with several Object Detection models performance, hold a promise for improving localization."

This agenda originated from the critical awareness that the capitalist cultural industry is hardly productive. In cultural industries, a few texts monopolize the market and eliminate less outstanding or innovative competitors. This is an example of the ‘slaughterhouse of literature’ that Franco Moretti spoke of. However, fan work as an example of participatory culture, exist as an opened and alternate network. Fan work is a form that is open to modification by others, and demonstrates a different level of productivity than products of capitalist market.The theme of this article is expressed through two detailed goals. First, this article examines the specific aspects in which AO3 produces texts. This is revealed in the process of reviewing the fan fiction of Squid Game. We looked at how the narrative of Squid Game was reconstructed by the convention of fan fiction existing on AO3, and how elements of Squid Game transformed texts from other fandom. By doing so, it was confirmed that AO3 is functioning as a space for transplanting different text traits to other species and further calling out their numbers.Second, this article highlights that AO3 is a space of transnational networks. It is reavealed through reviewing the crossover secondary work of Squid Game. The crossover of Squid Game was done along with texts including video games such as <Genshin Impact> and <Minecraft>, the <Harry Potter> franchise, and Japanese comics. At this time, AO3 functioned as a network connecting heterogeneous subcultural groups with almost no contact points. Here, the Internet is discovered as an spartial condition in which a horizontal fandom network could be created.To summarize, while the cultural industry market is a space where a few ‘bestsellers’ and ‘blockbusters’ exert centralized power, AO3 is a more horizontal and open network. At this time, fan-created sites, including AO3, exemplify a model of an alternative and counter cultural space to the cultural industry. Here, rather than a space where a few texts dictate, it shows a model of a new space of productivity where various texts can thrive together."
Planning and technological innovation: the governance challenges faced by English local authorities in adopting planning technologies,2023,"['Governance', 'Technology', 'United Kingdom', 'City Councils']",,"The term ‘smart city’ has become synonymous with a technologically cultivated utopia, where urban problems can be solved computationally. This approach to urban development has been promoted as a method of enabling city administrations to become more proactive when dealing with issues including pollution, traffic flow and congestion, public safety, energy use, and urban planning. This trend towards using technology in urban management and planning has sparked research and development initiatives across the planet. In the UK, the #PlanTech trend is a governmental initiative that aims to improve engagement between various actors in the planning system, including local authorities and central government, with tech start-ups and digital entrepreneurs who can design solutions to the problems currently experienced by planners, developers, and citizens alike. Despite the significant opportunities that technologies offer city council planning departments in terms of productivity, existing governance models can be shown to represent a significant obstacle to implementation. This paper uses case study research conducted at two English city councils – Coventry and Leeds – to examine the implications of planning reforms and digital transformation of public services on urban planning governance. Utilizing the information gained from a combination of semi-structured interviews and stakeholder engagement exercises, it examines the growing emphasis on technology in planning practice within the public sector and discusses the potential implications that it may have for current governance arrangements. Finally, it suggests what a framework for future urban planning governance within an English political context, in the era of the smart city might require. The paper overall offers a critical view of how current urban planning practice and governance procedures are being quickly subsumed by digital technologies which offer novel and effective methods for professional planners yet are undermined, or are inhibited, by current governance arrangements."

VR 영화에서 감독이 시청자들을 효과적으로 통제하는 수단은 감독이 VR 장면에서 촬영점과 시각적 단서를 통하여 서스펜스(suspense)를설계하여 시청자들에게 영화의 서사를 이끌고 시청자들에게 시각, 청각, 촉각 등 다양한 감각을 포함한 주의력유발 방식인 지각 주의를 알려주는 것이다. 시청자들은 주관적인 시점을 통하여 시각적 탐색 및 감독이 설정한시각적 단서와 상호작용하여 대립 관계를 형성할 수 있다.The Martian VR Experience를 중심으로 한 사례 분석을 통하여 VR 영화 서사 기술의 새로운 특징을 분석해보면 감독은 시각적 단서를 활용하여 시청자들이 주관적인 시점을 통하여 목표를 능동적으로 발견하고, 이후 수동적으로 작업을 수락하게 하여 영화 서사 방법을 설정한 것임을 알 수 있다.","Each invention of new technology in the history of film development has not only led to the proliferation of a new technology but also affected the film narrative.After a long time of digesting the new technology, the film has also promoted the innovation of the film narrative at the audio-visual language level. According to this technical characteristic, new technical aesthetics appears. VR film is based on the new technology aesthetics. There are many differences between film vision and VR film vision in viewing methods, audio-visual language, technical elements, etc.The purpose of this study is to analyze the new features of VR film visual technology by studying the characteristics of film to VR film visual technology based on visual grammar theory and diachronic relationship transformation research. It is preliminary to explore the new methods and means for directors to effectively control users in VR movies by when to display what content to users and what content to cover.Based on the viewpoint model and diachronic relationship transformation in the visual grammar theory, the previous study concluded that different viewpoints present changes in the viewing structure. The viewing structure of the movie viewpoint is a control relationship. The viewing structure of VR movies is confrontation. The transformation of diachronic relationship includes the transformation from control relationship to confrontation structure relationship.The technical feature of film vision is Hollywood classic three-shot method . The director forms his own film visual style through the differential arrangement and combination of the three-shot method, and effectively controls the audience through the sewing system.The visual technical characteristics of VR films are the selection and sequencing of visual cue elements. The director's effective control over users in VR movies is the way that the director guides the user's narration by arranging visual clues and designing suspense in the VR scene, and reminds the user of perceptual attention, including visual, auditory, tactile and other senses. The user interacts with the visual clues set by the director through the subjective perspective to form a confrontation relationship.The case study ""The Martian VR Experience"" concluded that the new feature of VR film visual narrative technology is that the director uses visual clues to let users actively find the target and passively accept the task through the subjective point of view for narrative guidance."

In this study, each country's regulations were subdivided into credit market regulations, labor market regulations, and business regulations, and the impact of each regulation on economic growth was empirically analyzed. This paper: ( ) finds the business deregulation has a significant effect on economic growth. Among the three regulations, business regulation was found to have a significant effect on economic growth; ( ) finds the inflation has a negative effect on economic growth, and the high inflation in the countries indicates that the economy is unstable, then it is negative for economic growth; ( ) finds the government expand increases, it has a negative impact on the next year's economic growth, so the expansion of government fiscal spending should clarify the limitations of fiscal spending as it increases the tax burden and lowers savings capacity for the people; ( ) finds the increase in per capita GDP has a negative effect on economic growth, which is prominent in high-income countries such as OECD countries, and it has a limited economic growth rate than low-income countries. As the economic paradigm shifts rapidly, such as digital transformation, it suggests that deregulation of companies is required for sustainable economic growth."

Education was chosen as the method of restoring national sovereignty. As a modern educator and scholar of national history, Jang Do-bin made efforts to correct the national spirit by compiling several books and working as a national history teacher. And at the same time, she advocates for women's education. She said that only by breaking down the Confucian customs of Joseon and educating women could they enter the new culture and become self-reliant. In 1925, 『Joseonmyeongbujeon』 was published based on this consciousness.The 10 women listed in the table of contents of 『Joseonmyeongbujeon』 are selected from 『Samguksagi』, and each has its own modifier attached. The modifier defines the ideal aspect of a woman, and it was also a model of the woman Jang Do-bin wanted to present to the women of Joseon.Jang Do-bin insisted on the transformation of women, but there is still a modifier representing Confucian women in Joseon in the Joseon Myeongbu. The story concludes with 'women's acts' - ‘state industry’. This is the point where we can know that the country was promoted through the role of women at the time. Therefore, these women were reinterpreted according to Dobin Jang's needs, and furthermore, it can be said that they are the result of reflecting the demands of the times."

To this end, the overall development and development process, main features and functions of ChatGPT were examined. In addition, the change of Korean language education according to the advancement of ChatGPT's function was predicted, and the way Korean language education should go was explored in order to respond to it.As a generative and conversational artificial intelligence, the main features and functions of ChatGPT are as follows. First of all, as generative artificial intelligence, it searches and learns numerous materials on the Internet based on large language models and generative pre-trained transformer to produce results. Next, as a conversational artificial intelligence, it is possible to communicate in the form of daily conversation, remembers the contents of previous conversations, and reflects them in subsequent conversations. It works like a chatbot, and when you ask a question in the form of a ‘sentence’, the result is output in various ways, such as text.The following is a look at the impact that the advancement of the ChatGPT function will have on Korean language education and the countermeasures against it. First, the impact on Korean language education can be problems such as ① the challenge of writing education in general, ② the deepening of the ethical problem of writing, and ③ the spread of fake information. To respond to this, it is necessary to ① redefine the nature of writing education, ② (tentative name) strengthen writing ethics education by preparing ethical principles for writing using artificial intelligence, and ③ expand critical literacy education through critical reading instruction.The emergence of ChatGPT and the development of technology that is advancing day by day may be felt as a significant challenge toward Korean language education. However, rather than paying attention to its side effects or shortcomings, it is necessary to pay attention to the advantages of positive and instrumental use. Therefore, the exploration of how to utilize it from the point of view of win-win and coexistence and instrumental point of view, rather than the confrontation between machines and humans, will be much more productive and progressive. I hope that research on the use of artificial intelligence to support human growth will continue."
각색 연구와 번역학의 접점 모색: 가즈오 이시구로의 <남아있는 나날> 영화 각색에서 믿을 수 없는 서술의 각색 변이를 기반으로,2023,"['영화 각색', '믿을 수 없는 서술', '영화 <남아있는 나날>', '번역학과 각색 연구', '각색 변이', 'Film adaptation', 'unreliable narration', 'The Remains of the Day', 'adaptation studies and translation studies', 'adaptation shift']",,"In Kazuo Ishiguro’s novel The Remains of the Day (1989), the entire story is narrated in the first person by the butler, Mr. Stevens. His account of events often appears to be faulty, biased, or distorted. Mr. Stevens is arguably an unreliable narrator who conceals everything, including his own relationship with the former housekeeper Kenton and his former employer’s dubious associations with the Nazis. These hidden truths create a tension between what the reader is told and what they can only speculate about in Ishiguro’s work. This study aims to explore whether the film adaptation, also titled The Remains of the Day (1993), effectively conveys this tension to the audience. Specifically, the focus is on examining any shifts in unreliable narration resulting from the transition from novel to film. Using the adaptation shift model, this study identifies changes in plot structure, narrative techniques, and character portrayal. Regarding the plot, the dominance of Mr. Stevens over the camera lens, which mimics his point of view, is less prominent in the film, indicating a loss of control over the narrative. In terms of narrative techniques, the film adaptation employs flashbacks, point-of-view shots, and reverse shots to convey the first-person perspective. However, the mise-en-scène makes the truth more explicit, failing to conceal it from the audience. Lastly, Mr. Stevens is depicted as an even more tragic figure who comes to realize the emptiness of his life. The adaptation transforms characters who may appear inhumane in prose into more humane figures on screen. The significance of this article is that it demonstrates the intersection of adaptation studies and translation studies, and the potential for interdisciplinary research, by suggesting that the multilayered aspects of novel-to-film adaptations can be analyzed with greater sophistication and precision by adopting the methodology of descriptive translation studies."

To address this question, this paper aims to examine the faith formation education that PROK has pursued and to propose the type of education that will be needed in the future.In the 1970s, during the early days of Korean Christian education, PROK criticized that church education had transformed into a tool for the church's quantitative expansion, advocating dualistic afterlife beliefs and placing a strong emphasis on the salvation of individual souls. On the basis of the theology of the ""ecumenical movement"" and the ""Missio Dei"" in the new direction of church education, PROK empathized with the pain of the times and stood with God on the side of the weak in order to form faith for justice, peace, and ecological preservation.While this educational direction was pioneering and remains relevant today, it failed to take root in the local church context, thus unable to shape a faith that transforms the lives of individuals and the church community.Therefore, to educate for the faith formation of the next generation, it is necessary to provide education that helps learners shape their faith in relation to their lives in accordance with contemporary demands, while pursuing the faith professed by PROK. This paper, therefore, proposes education aimed at facilitating faith formation, including ""education for the establishment of faith identity,"" ""education for critical thinking and the exploration of hopeful alternatives,"" ""education for the formation of faith community in the online and offline world,"" and ""spiritual education for the realization of hope."" In order for these educational approaches to meet the experiences of the next generation learners in the church education context and be applied in their lives, a model based on the ""Religious Education Related to Experience"" course has been proposed."

The study utilizes real transaction apartment price data ranging from January 1, 2015, to February 2023, encompassing the period before the store closure announcement and the subsequent transformation of the site into an office-tel (integrated office and residence building).To investigate the impact on housing prices, multilevel linear regression modeling based on the triple difference approach was employed. The analysis revealed a significant negative impact on housing prices, with reductions of up to 38.8% observed following the announcement of the store closure, indicative of a capitalization effect. Over time, the negative effects exhibited an increasing trend before being somewhat alleviated after the completion of the alternative development.Nevertheless, the closure’s influence on housing prices in the neighboring areas remained considerable and even permanent. The study also found that the magnitude of the negative effect varied based on the distance from the closed large-scale retail store. The negative impact was more pronounced within a radius of 250 to 500 meters compared to the area within a 250-meter radius. Furthermore, the effect dissipated beyond the 500-meter radius. The findings underscore the significance of considering spillover effects resulting from such closures on the surrounding real estate market. They emphasize the necessity for strategic urban planning and policy interventions to effectively mitigate adverse impacts on housing prices in the vicinity of such large-scale retail store developments. Overall, this research sheds light on the intricate relationship between retail store closures and housing prices, providing valuable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and stakeholders seeking to understand and manage the dynamics of the real estate market in the context of such transformative events."

Sorafenib (SOR), a frontline drug for the treatment of HCC, induces ferroptosis by inhibiting the Solute Carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11), with inadequate ferroptosis notably contributing to SOR resistance in tumor cells.Methods To further verify the biological targets associated with ferroptosis in HCC, an analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was performed to find a significant co-upregulation of SLC7A11 and transferrin receptor (TFRC), Herein, cell membrane-derived transferrin nanovesicles (TF NVs) coupled with Fe3+ and encapsulated SOR (SOR@TF-Fe3+ NVs) were established to synergistically promote ferroptosis, which promoted the iron transport metabolism by TFRC/TF-Fe3+ and enhanced SOR efficacy by inhibiting the SLC7A11.Results In vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that SOR@TF-Fe3+ NVs predominantly accumulate in the liver, and specifically targeted HCC cells overexpressing TFRC. Various tests demonstrated SOR@TF-Fe3+ NVs accelerated Fe3+ absorption and transformation in HCC cells. Importantly, SOR@TF-Fe3+ NVs were more effective in promoting the accumulation of lipid peroxides (LPO), inhibiting tumor proliferation, and prolonging survival rates in HCC mouse model than SOR and TF- Fe3+ NVs alone.Conclusions The present work provides a promising therapeutic strategy for the targeted treatment of HCC."
Enhancing Low-light Images for Monocular Visual Odometry in Challenging Lighting Conditions,2023,"['Deep learning', 'generative adversarial network', 'low-light image enhancement', 'style transfer', 'visual odometry.']",,"Visual odometry (VO) estimates the robot’s current position based on feature matching or brightness variation between images, making it primarily suitable for well-lit environments with good image quality. Consequently, existing visual odometry methods exhibit degraded performance in low-light or highly dynamic environments, limiting their operational efficiency in outdoor settings. To overcome these challenges, research has been conducted to enhance low-light images to improve odometry performance. Recent advancements in deep learning have facilitated extensive research on image enhancement, including low-light conditions. Utilizing generative adversarial networks (GANs) and techniques like CycleGAN, researchers have achieved robust improvements in various lighting conditions and enhanced odometry performance in low-light environments. However, these methods are typically trained on single images, compromising the structural consistency between consecutive images. In this paper, we propose learning-based low-light image enhancement and the preservation of structural consistency between consecutive images for monocular visual odometry. The proposed model utilizes the CycleGAN approach for domain transformation between different illumination levels, effectively avoiding the failure of visual odometry in low-light environments. To handle diverse lighting conditions within images, a local discriminator is employed to enhance local brightness. Additionally, a structure loss is introduced using sequence images to ensure structural consistency between the original and generated images. This method simultaneously improves low-light conditions and preserves structural consistency, leading to enhanced visual odometry performance in low-light environments."
Ziva VFX에서 효율적 토폴로지 접근법에 관한 연구,2023,"['지바 사면체', '토폴로지', '근수축 및 이완', '최대이완기', '최대 수축기', 'Ziva Tetrahedron', 'Topology', 'Muscle Contraction and Relaxation', 'Maximal Relaxation', 'Maximal Contraction']",,"In this paper, we propose a calculation formula for ZTet's Tetrahedron Size in the Ziva VFX plug-in (Every 'Tet' means Tetrahedron in this paper). The formula aims to reduce simulation time and alleviate the burden of research that requires extensive anatomical knowledge. Additionally, by applying the formula provided in this paper, effective values can be set, resulting in shorter simulation times and increased work efficiency. Specifically, assuming that only bone (ZBones) and muscle (ZTet and ZTissue) operations were completed, it took approximately 50 minutes to simulate and extract a 90-frame image at a frame rate of 30 fps. The application of the formula enables the derivation of accurate values by approximating even when each object has a different topology. The ultimate objective of this study is to establish a formula that can be practically implemented, accelerating the speed of Ziva work while minimizing errors in biophysical calculations and mechanical calculations for muscle contraction. We transform and evolve existing methods to produce completely new formulas and verify their validity through simulation experiments. Verification is compared and analyzed with the range of actual muscle movement using distance measurement tools within the Maya program. This advancement is expected to facilitate the production of high-quality organic life models, including anatomical representations, thus enhancing the overall quality of the output."

This study focuses on ways to nurture cultural diversity within the youth education spectrum. It examines how the experience of collaborative music-making closely parallels community building practices in terms of embracing and honoring oneself and others, argu- ing that the implication of collective artmaking in youth education in South Korea may help children’s understanding and acceptance of multiculturalism.This study also closely investigated three methods of El Sistema, a pioneer youth orchestra program that opened the door to the possibility of pursuing orchestral education as a transformational agent for cultural improvement in society. Instead of focusing on the musical aspects of the program, it highlights the extramusical components of El Sistema’s methods that contribute to social improvement. Finally, the study suggests that South Korea may apply collabo- rative music-making activities and the El Sistema model as baseline data to strategically plan community-based educational programs that integrate and em- brace cultural  diversity."

Second, they insisted that infants and toddlers’ developmental stage need to be segmented, and thus the developmental stage by age of months and the details on developmental characteristics after seven years of age should be added. Third, they argued that the teachers need to enhance their competences as a play supporter so that the 2019 revised Nuri curriculum can be operated. Lastly, they demanded the development of programs for interpersonal relations and the communication competences and the evaluation method improvement in evaluation and accreditation. The Although the importance of ecological transformation education, democratic citizenship education, and digital literacy reflected in the 2022 elementary, middle and high school curriculum revision as core competencies for future education of early childhood teachers is recognized, there is a lack of understanding of the practice method in the field of early childhood education.Conclusions The results of this study can be reflected in the composition of the curriculum for pre-service early childhood teachers and the training contents of in-service teachers, which can enhance the core competence of teachers for future education. As a follow-up study, it is necessary to explore a core competency model for fostering early childhood teachers that reflects the core competency required in the field of early childhood education and responding to changes in the future society."

According to Hegel, the philosophical traditions of “Orient” are attributed to be impure and non-truth, because they remain in the undeveloped state of mixture between nature and reason. The result is a narrative of philosophy that is a linear development from Ancient Greek philosophy to German Idealism. In a similar manner, Habermas’ new work on history of philosophy Auch eine Geschichte der Philosophie repeats this Eurocentric scheme, excluding all philosophical schools of Axial Age (Achsenzeit) for being religious and thus pre-philosophical.Such inherent mechanisms of exclusion encoded in the European histories of philosophy have prevented virtually all Non-European philosophical traditions from entering the general history of philosophy. The DFG research project “Histories of Philosophy in a Global Perspective” at the University of Hildesheim aims to study and re-integrate alternative modes of historiographic representations of philosophical traditions of the world. Following this objective, I gathered and commented Korean bibliographical sources in History of Philosophy and Thought in the Korean Language. I have summarized the most important methodological considerations and results of this book. A clear focus lies on pre-modern documents and documents from the colonial period (prior to 1945), in order to expose the process of collision between traditional and European historiographic models of philosophy. How can the traditional genealogical knowlegde and alternative time structure be translated and transformed into a global history of philosophy?Finally, the conception of a so construed global history of philosophy leads to the question: On the horizon of a global history of philosophy, what can the future historiography of Korean philosophy be?"
"냉전시대의 감시와 스파이: 존 르 카레의『팅커, 테일러, 솔저, 스파이』를 중심으로",2023,"['John le Carré', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Solider', 'Spy', 'Surveillance', 'Spy', 'the Cold War', 'Digital Technology', 'Thingness']",,"The period of the Cold War is renowned for its paranoid surveillance. The collective fascination with the elusive and unobservable operations of espionage in everyday life was the driving force behind the development of the spy fiction genre. This essay examines the portrayal of surveillance in John le Carré’s novel Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy (1974), which achieved both critical and commercial success. The narrative of the novel revolves around George Smiley’s investigation of a double agent within the British Military Intelligence who is clandestinely serving the Soviet Union.The surveillance techniques depicted in the novel employ the media available at that time, while also presaging the digital monitoring methods used in the twenty-first century. Smiley does not follow the typical detective model that aims to eliminate risk factors and restore social order. Instead, in le Carré’s work, surveillance is used to maintain the homeostasis of society by transforming the entirety of the human experience into data and subjecting the population to constant control. Nevertheless, Smiley once failed to read his archenemy Karla due to the latter’s embodiment of “things.” The novel suggests that what might resist digital surveillance is not human values as commonly understood, but the inherent “thingness” that cannot be reduced to exploitable data. The novel illuminates the paradox of surveillance, as it portrays how surveillance appears to transform humanity into data, yet still relies on the existing human needs and desires for the data to be useful. Consequently, le Carré’s work encourages readers to reexamine the nature of humanity in the face of the unprecedented threat of digital surveillance exploitation."

The purpose of this study is to search the direction of Korea's cultural policy in the post COVID-19 era. The research results can be summarized into the followings: Firstly, the basic framework of cultural policy should be established. Korean cultural policies have changed according to changes in the government, but it is necessary to establish a basic framework for their contents to promote the continuous development of cultural policies. Secondly, it is necessary to support technology development and digital platform construction for digital transformation in line with the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Thirdly, cultural policies should be promoted centering on consumers. It is necessary to grasp the reality of the downturn in the cultural sector caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide efficient policy support. Fourthly, welfare support for culture and artists should be strengthened. And lastly, we suggest a four-phase model for the cutural policy intervention according to two dimensions of short-long term period and readiness-potentiality."
Characterization of Distribution of Microstructure and Micro-mechanical Properties of Nickel-Based Single Crystal Superalloy Within the Shot-Peened Layer,2023,['Residual stress · Shot peening · Nickel-based single crystal superalloy · Instrumented indentation · Mechanical properties'],,"Distributions of hardness, elastic modulus, yield strength, and residual stress within the shot-peened layer of nickel-basedsingle crystal superalloy were measured by instrumented indentation with Berkovich indenter under a constant indentationdisplacement of 400 nm. Elastic modulus is little affected by shot peening, while yield strength calculated by Nobre’s methodis significantly increased. The hardness and residual stress calculated by Vickers hardness testing are also proportional to theresults by instrumented indentation. Indentation parameters such as hardness, indentation work, and contact area linearlydepend on residual stress. Microstructures observed by SEM and EBSD show that the crystal orientation is severely distortedwithin 20 μm from the peened surface. The thickness of the plastic deformation layer measured by EBSD is 60 μm. XRDresults show that the number of diffraction peaks increases after shot peening, indicating the transformation from singlecrystal to polycrystalline structure; residual stress, domain size, microstrain, and dislocation density of shot-peened layerare − 837.5 MPa, 12.88–37.68 nm, 4.39–6.17 × 10–3, and 4.84–8.15 × 1015m−2, respectively. The values of residual stresscalculated by different nanoindentation models are different, but they are proportional to one another with a similar variationwithin the shot-peened surface. David’s model is the most suitable one to assess residual stresses of single crystals byperforming nanoindentation tests on the side surface that is perpendicular to the peened surface. The maximum compressiveresidual stress calculated by David's model is 1.26 GPa at the depth of 38 μm, and the total depth of compressive residualstress is about 130 μm."

However, studies on seismic PSA for process plants, such as gas plants, oil refineries, and chemical plants, have been scarce. This is because the major disasters to which these process plants are vulnerable include explosions, fires, and release (or dispersion) of toxic chemicals. However, seismic PSA is essential for the plants located in regions with significant earthquake risks. Seismic PSA entails probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA), event tree analysis (ETA), fault tree analysis (FTA), and fragility analysis for the structures and essential equipment items. Among those analyses, ETA can depict the accident sequence for core damage, which is the worst disaster and top event concerning NPPs. However, there is no general top event with regard to process plants. Therefore, PSA cannot be directly applied to process plants. Moreover, there is a paucity of studies on developing fragility curves for various equipment. This paper introduces PSA for gas plants based on FTA, which is then transformed into Bayesian network, that is, a probabilistic graph model that can aid risk-informed decision-making. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a gas plant, and several decision-making cases are demonstrated."

In the 2009 revised mathematics curriculum, matrices were removed from high school math education to reduce the burden on students, but in anticipation of the age of artificial intelligence, they will be reintegrated into the 2022 revised education curriculum. Therefore, there is a need to analyze the matrix content covered in other countries to suggest a meaningful direction for matrix education and to derive implications for textbook composition. In this study, we analyzed the German mathematics curriculum and standard education curriculum, as well as the matrix units in the German Hesse state mathematics curriculum and textbook, and identified the characteristics of their content elements and development methods. As a result of our analysis, it was found that the German textbooks cover matrices in three categories: matrices for solving linear equations, matrices for explaining linear transformations, and matrices for explaining transition processes. It was also found that the emphasis was on mathematical reasoning and modeling when learning matrices. Based on these findings, we suggest that if matrices are to be reintegrated into school mathematics, the curriculum should focus on deep conceptual understanding, mathematical reasoning, and mathematical modeling in textbook composition."

Consequently, it is necessary to develop an up-to-date list of the causes of diseases and establish a survey panel for estimating disability weights. Accordingly, this study was conducted to calculate, assess, modify, and validate disability weights suitable for Korea, accounting for its cultural and social characteristics. Methods: The 380 causes of disease used in the survey were derived from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network and from 2019 and 2020 Korean studies on disability weights for causes of disease. Disability weights were reanalyzed by integrating the findings of an earlier survey on disability weights in Korea with those of the additional survey conducted in this study. The responses were transformed into paired comparisons and analyzed using probit regression analysis. Coefficients for the causes of disease were converted into predicted probabilities, and disability weights in 2 models (model 1 and 2) were rescaled using a normal distribution and the natural logarithm, respectively. Results: The mean values for the 380 causes of disease in models 1 and 2 were 0.488 and 0.369, respectively. Both models exhibited the same order of disability weights. The disability weights for the 300 causes of disease present in both the current and 2019 studies demonstrated a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.994 (p=0.001 for both models). This study presents a detailed add-on approach for calculating disability weights. Conclusions: This method can be employed in other countries to obtain timely disability weight estimations."

The diminishing interest in the gospel, particularly among the younger generations in Korea, the U.S., and the Korean immigrant community, reflects the broader decline of Christianity in the face of postmodern skepticism and diverse worldviews.This study delves into the multifaceted reasons behind the waning appeal of Christianity in Korean immigrants, emphasizing the crucial role of church behavior in shaping public perceptions. In addition, This research underscores the necessity for a paradigm shift in the mindset of American and Korean churches to preserve the essence of Christianity in the face of skepticism. Drawing inspiration from Lesslie Newbigin’s Missional Church concept, which redefines the mission field as the local community, the study proposes a viable alternative model for Korean immigrant churches in the United States. Newbigin’s emphasis on spreading the gospel within the immediate surroundings aligns with the challenges faced by Korean immigrant churches, offering a transformative approach to mission in the post-Christendom and post-colonial era.Ultimately, this research explores the potential of integrating the Missional Church movement with Newbigin’s ideas as a strategic response to the decline of Christianity, fostering a renewed sense of purpose and relevance for Korean immigrant churches in the contemporary U.S. context."

In this paper, we seek to research the meaning of disease-ecology from an humanistic perspective by focusing on how the relationship between gods and humans varies depending on the heterotopia characteristics of each spatial layer.Heterotopia is a space defined by Foucault and refers to a utopian place that is actually realized. In the appearing human world of guests, the heterotopia characteristics of boundaries and off-boundaries at each spatial level are clear. Yujeom Temple and Hero Teacher's House, which form the boundary, are a heterotopia of gods versus humans, and are built from the stories of the guests' activities in performing their divine duties. In the delivery stories, boundaries are broken down and a new heterotopia is rebuilt as it transforms into a space for Makdongimalnoli.The characteristics of heterotopia at each spatial level are closely related to changes in the human world. The elements of change in the human world  include gods versus humans, Teacher Hero, and Cheolryong through disease. In particular, Cheolryong, as a new personality, not only rebuilds heterotopia, but also plays a decisive role in influencing the overall epic. As the performance of divine duties fails due to the dynamic relationship between gods and humans, the guests set up Teacher Hero as a role model for the ritual.The performance of divine duties in <Sonnimgut> is completed through Cheolryong. Cheolryong is a person who was sacrificed in the conflict between gods and humans, but he transforms his guests from bad gods to good gods through a transition into existence. Just as today's vaccines undergo clinical trials and are administered to the general public under social trust, in <Sonnimgut>, the relationship between gods and humans at each spatial level changes from distrust to trust through the epic function of the two characters, resulting in the co-evolution of disease and ecology, resulting in disease. The goal was to ensure the continuity of the end."

Rain streaks were extracted using the k-nearest neighbor algorithm by calculating the difference between each image and the background. To prevent overfitting, data with pixel values greater than set threshold, compared to the average pixel value for each image, were selected. The area with maximum pixel variability was determined by shifting with every 10 pixels and set as a representative area (180×180) for the original image. After re-transforming to 120×120 size as an input data for convolutional neural networks model, image augmentation was progressed under unified shooting conditions. 92% of the data showed within the 10% absolute range of PBIAS.

A company's dream-vision allows its members to know and create directions for innovation. In addition, the company’s dream-vision presentation has seen the relationship of the company’s innovation and has verified how enhancing the member’s capabilities has an adjustment effect on the innovation of the entity. Research has shown that the dream-vision of an entity has a significant effect on the innovation of the entity, and that the capacity-enhancing of the entity’s members, which is the adjustment effect, also has a significant effect on the innovation. Therefore, the clear and actionable dream-vision of an entity should be presented in the innovation of the entity, and the development of the capabilities of the entity’s members plays an important role in order for the innovation to have a more meaningful. Through various innovative activities and capacity development of members, which are necessary to achieve a company's dream-to achieve a vision, the company can generate results of its development.

The MagicPoint detector is advanced using feature points extracted from various VHR remote sensing open-source datasets. Pseudo-label is generated in the VHR satellite imagery by the advanced MagicPoint detector. At this time, homographic adaptation is applied to consider the various geometric environments. SuperPoint is built using the VHR satellite imagery and the pseudo-label. The image registration is conducted using an estimated non-linear transformation model based on extracted conjugate points through the proposed method. Based on experiments conducted from KOMPSAT-3 imagery acquired over the Daejeon city,the proposed method evenly extracted numerous conjugate points over the overlapping areas, and registration accuracy was measured as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) 1.563 pixels and CE90 (Circular Error 90%) 1.971 pixels.

Drawing upon previous discussions, this study analyzed the problem of perception of book review and presented a book review education plan based on modern genre theory.After reviewing previous discussions on how to write a book review, this study found that there were many cases that proposed a book review method based on the comparison between a book report and a book review. However, by looking at the contents of the book reviews written by students, it was found that the distinctions between the instructor's book report and the book review were unclear.Accordingly, this study aimed to propose an educational plan for writing a book review based on genre awareness. It was designed to foster an understanding of the book review genre through individual and group activities, which included the following stages: “collecting samples of the genre,” “identifying the scene and describing the situation in which the genre is used,” “identifying and describing the genre’s features,” “analyzing what these patterns reveal about the situation and scene,” “understanding genre transformation patterns,” and “conceptualizing a summary of genre awareness.” Subsequently, as part of the genre-writing practice stage, this study proposed a procedural instructional model for writing a book review. This model includes the following stages: “drafting the book review,” “feedback regarding the book review,” “writing a final version of the book review,” and “reflecting on the process of writing the book review.” This study is significant in that it allows students to self-directedly write a book review based on their awareness of the genre, which is distinct from the familiar genre of book report. In addition, by presenting detailed procedures for genre awareness learning stages that have not been dealt with so far, this study can be evaluated as meaningful in that it allows students to develop a genre awareness of book review."

The crux of this inquiry centers on the postmemory Generation MZ’s cultural memory of Japanese repression during the colonial era. The main argument is that, to effectively engage Generation MZ—a demographic distinct in its temporal detachment from the events yet deeply enmeshed in its cultural aftermath—memorial museums must undertake a dramatic transformation in their exhibition content organization. Memorial museums are tasked with curating content that not only resonates with Generation MZ’s interest in the Japanese colonial period but also integrating their narratives and identities, which have been invariably shaped by the historical legacies. By embedding the stories and lived experiences of Generation MZ within the broader narrative of the exhibits, these museums can transform into dynamic spaces where past and present converge. Here, the generation that directly experienced these events and the subsequent postmemory generation can engage in meaningful dialogues, fostering a shared understanding of history. Such a transformation would mark a departure from a unidirectional, authoritative educational approach, replacing it with a model of interactive and participatory communication. This approach not only honors the complexity of historical events but also acknowledges the evolving nature of memory and identity in the context of generational shifts."

The European Pillar of Social Rights (EPSR), European Green Deal (EGD), The European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan, and the Porto Declaration, respectively adopted in 2017, 2019 and 2021 are the papers subject to analysis. Through their analysis, the paper would like to find its characteristics by comparing the European Union's recent social policy, which is being promoted along with countermeasures against the climate crisis, with existing social policies. In the process of European integration, European Union’s social policy has been promoted around areas that can be agreed between member states. The parts where conflicts are expected among member states have been bypassed and the feasibility has been increased through such a practical approach. The European Union's recent social policy in relation to digital transformation and green transformation, which are being promoted in terms of a complex crisis response strategy, are also being implemented within this framework. The most outstanding characteristic is that recent social policy is being carried out in close connection with climate change response and environmental policies unlike the traditional model that was mainly coordinated with economic policies. The recent trend of European Union social policy can be evaluated positively in that it is expanding its horizon by presenting socio-ecological goals, but it is still based on economic growth strategies, which is insufficient to overcome the pointed limitations."

The biochar (BC) was produced through slow pyrolysis of macroalgal biomass, which was subsequently activated with potassium hydroxide (KOH) to produce a KOH-modified activated carbon (KOH-AC) catalyst. Advanced characterization techniques, including SEM, EDX, XRD, FTIR, and TGA, were used to examine the physicochemical characteristics of the catalysts. The synthesized catalysts were utilized to produce biodiesel from WCO, and the results revealed that the highest biodiesel yields, 98.96%, and 47.54%, were obtained using KOH-AC and BC catalysts, respectively, under optimal reaction conditions of 66 °C temperature, 12.3 M/O molar ratio, 130 min time, and 3.08 wt.% catalyst loading via RSM optimization. The kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, such as k, Ea, ΔH, ΔS, and ΔG, were determined to be 0.0346 min? 1, 43.31 kJ mol? 1, 38.98 kJ mol? 1, ? 158.38 J K? 1 mol? 1, and 92.58 kJ mol? 1, respectively. The KOH-AC catalyst was recycled up to five times, with a significant biodiesel yield of 80.37%. The fuel properties of the biodiesel met ASTM (D6751) specifications, ensuring that it has excellent fuel characteristics and can be used as an alternative fuel."

As a way to attract tourists and promote economic recovery, this study explored an optimization plan for public facilities in a linear park along the lower part of the Suyeong River in Busan, South Korea. The study conducted research on the need for remodeling, the scope of demand for public facilities, and the level of demand by facility type, and developed a plan to improve public facilities. With the goal of attracting tourists, the Busan Center City Tourist District and the Gwangalli Tourist District united to promote the overall development of the tourist area downstream of the Suyeong River. (Method) First, this study investigated the current state of facilities, analyzed data on the functionality of local residents and surrounding areas, and explored the need for facility renovation. Second, the best direction for reconstruction was elucidated by analyzing elements such as urban redevelopment, the revitalization of the local economy, urban parks, and linear spaces through a literature review. Third, the functions of domestic and foreign waterside linear space facilities were investigated, and the types and ranges of park facilities were organized. Fourth, using an expert interview survey, the demand range of public facilities was investigated by combining it with the current status of the Suyeong lecture; the types of public facilities within the demand range were studied using the KANO model, and the degree of demand for various facilities was investigated. (Results) It was found that regional factors such as indicators, standards, social and attractive features, facilities, and transportation affected economic recovery. It was also concluded that cultural, social, accessibility, physical, environmental, and resting-space factors should be considered when renovating waterside linear parks. The survey showed that the demand for leisure and entertainment facilities was the highest, and in the KANO model survey, the demand for leisure and entertainment facilities in hydrophilic spaces was found to be the highest. (Conclusions) When optimizing and transforming waterfront linear spaces, attention should be paid to the relevant design elements, scope of utility requirements, and specific types of facility. Second, it is necessary to design public facilities that meet local needs and study demands, and then push for better changes. Finally, it is necessary to study the direction of future linear spatial transformation by attracting tourists through changes to public facilities and restoring the economy of the lower area of the Suyeong River."
공리주의적 분배와 평등주의적 분배의 공존 가능성,2023,"['공리주의', '평등주의', '최적분배', '공존 가능성', '정태적 공존', '동태적 공존', 'Utilitarianism', 'Egalitarianism', 'Optimal distribution', 'Compatibility', 'Static coexistence', 'Dynamic coexistence']","본 연구는 공리주의적 분배와 평등주의적 분배의 공존 가능성을 주제로, 양자가 일치하는 경우와 양자가 불일치하는 경우에 대하여 분석하였다. 분석방법으로는 Edgeworth의 정태적 최적분배모형을 기본으로 하여, Edgeworth의 가정에 변화를 주면서 최적분배모형이 어떻게 변용되는지에 대하여 그래프분석과 한계효용 및 총효용 분석을 시도하였다.분석 결과, 공리주의적 분배와 평등주의적 분배의 차이와 공통점이 명확해졌다. 그리고 결국은 사회 내에 존재하는 개인들의 효용함수구조가 어떠하냐에 따라서, 공리주의적 분배와 평등주의적 분배의 공존 여부가 결정된다는 것을 알 수 있다. 이것은 정태적 공존 여부뿐만 아니라 동태적 공존 여부도 마찬가지이다. 개인들의 효용함수가 같든 다르든 한계효용이 모두 체감하거나, 아니면 어느 한 사람의 한계효용이 불변이더라도 공리주의적 분배와 평등주의적 분배의 정태적 공존 및 동태적 공존은 어느 정도 가능하다. 그러나 개인들의 효용함수가 같든 다르든 어느 한 사람이라도 한계효용이 체증하는 경우에는, 공리주의적 분배와 평등주의적 분배의 정태적 공존 및 동태적 공존이 100% 불가능하다.따라서 분배 문제와 관련해서는 재분배정책의 내용과 구조를 아무리 정교하게 짠다고 해도, 놀부처럼 욕심이 많고 끊임없이 더 많이 가진 사람과 비교하면서 더 많은 소득을 차지하려는 일중독자(workaholic)가 존재하거나 저소득자이지만 소득의 한계효용이 지속적으로 올라가는 사람이 존재한다면, 정책실패로 귀결될 수밖에 없다고 판단된다.","This study focused on the possibility of coexistence of utilitarian distribution and egalitarian distribution, and analyzed cases where the two coincide and cases where the two do not match. As an analysis method, based on Edgeworth’s static optimal distribution model, graph analysis and marginal utility and total utility analysis were attempted to see how the optimal distribution model was transformed by changing Edgeworth’s assumptions.As a result of the analysis, the differences and commonalities between utilitarian distribution and egalitarian distribution became clear. And ultimately, it can be seen that whether utilitarian distribution and egalitarian distribution coexist is determined depending on the utility function structure of individuals existing in society. This applies not only to static coexistence but also to dynamic coexistence. Whether the utility functions of the individuals are the same or different, if their marginal utilities all decrease. or even if the marginal utility of one person is constant, the static and dynamic coexistence of utilitarian distribution and egalitarian distribution is possible to some extent. However, regardless of whether the utility functions of individuals are the same or different, if the marginal utility of any one person increases, the static and dynamic coexistence of utilitarian distribution and egalitarian distribution is 100% impossible.Therefore, with regard to the distribution issue, no matter how elaborate the content and structure of the redistribution policy are, if there are workaholics like Nolbu who are greedy and constantly seek to gain more income by comparing themselves to those who have more, or if there are people whose marginal utility continues to rise but they are low-income, it is judged that this will inevitably result in policy failure."
의료시스템과학 등장의 역사적 배경: 1910년대부터 2010년대까지의 미국 의료 체계 개혁과 의학교육을 중심으로,2023,"['Health  Systems  Science', 'medical  education', 'medical reform', 'ObamaCare', 'health insurance', '의료시스템과학', '의학교육', '의료개혁', '오바마케어', '의료보험']",,"This study traces the historical process of the emergence of Health Systems Science (HSS) over one hundred years from the 1910s to the 2010s. HSS is a discipline introduced in American medical education as a “third pillar” in addition to basic medical science and clinical medical science.  HSS  comprises  seven  core  functional  domains  and  four foundational domains, all surrounded by ‘system thinking.’ According to statistics from 2019 to 2020, 129 universities, or 83.2% of all allopathic and osteopathic medical schools taught HSS before medical clerkship.Additionally, 108 universities, or 69.7% of all medical schools taught HSS during medical clerkship.Although the Progressives in the 1910s sparked discussions about reforming the U.S. national health care system, the National Health Insurance (NHI) debate did not make significant progress from the 1920s through World War II. Efforts to reform the healthcare system gained momentum again in the 1960s. In 1965, a social health insurance program for the elderly called “Medicare” was enacted by revamping the existing social security program. Around the same time, “Medicaid” was also implemented as government-funded health insurance program, distinguishing it from Medicare—a mix of social insurance and government assistance. During the Clinton presidency in the 1990s, political efforts to achieve the NHI by enacting the Health Security Act eventually failed.Almost twenty years later, President Barrack Obama passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, in March 2010. The primary objectives of ObamaCare were to increase the number of insured Americans and reduce health care costs. Post-ObamaCare reforms to the healthcare payment system and changes to the healthcare delivery system have prompted a transformation of the healthcare landscape. The healthcare industry has been pursuing the “triple aim”: improving patient experience and population health while reducing costs. To achieve these goals, exposure to a systems-based healthcare environment was necessary.From the 1910s to the 1960s, the model of the ideal physician was the “sovereign physician,” who could perform all tasks unilaterally. During this time, doctors were autonomous, independent, and authoritative, and in control of all medical activities. This model was very useful until the mid-twentieth century, when there were many acute illnesses, mainly infectious diseases. Abraham Flexner’s 1910 report eventually accelerated the formation of a medical education system based on the two pillars of “basic science—clinical science.” During the periods of the 1920s and 1940s, medical education underwent a process of professionalization, standardization, and systematization. World War II did not result in significant changes in medical education. The United States, however, was transforming into a very different society from the prewar period for physicians and Americans. The “New Deal” and World War II led to an expanded role of the federal and state governments in the post-war years. The demand for healthcare was also growing, and the right to healthcare was seen as a fundamental right of all citizens.In the 1960s and 1970s, the current U.S. medical education system was established. Four years of medical school, an internship, and a residency before taking the board examination became the institutional requirements. In the 1980s and 1990s, ‘managed care,’ represented by Healthcare Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) and Preferred Provider Organizations  (PPOs),  placed  strong  controls  on  both  doctors  and hospitals (academic healthcare centers). Under the managed care system, academic healthcare centers financially struggled. Moreover, the learning environment on the wards was eroded by shorter patient stays and increased outpatient visits.Since the late 1990s, many medical education organizations, including the Council on Graduate Medical Educat..."

Recently, the structural application of grid-type FRP reinforcement has been expanded in order to reduce the weight of members and to improve eco-friendliness of the reinforced concrete (RC) structure. This paper experimentally investigated the effective depth of the section and the spacing of strands in the weft and warp direction on the flexural behavior of textile reinforced concrete (TRC) slabs applied the biaxial warp knitting structure grid-type CFRP reinforcement (hereafter referred to as carbon grid) with the narrow spacing of strands. As a result, it was found that the maximum load increased and the deflection at peak decreased as the effective depth increased. In addition, when the strand spacing was narrow, the load was gradually reduced as the load was transferred to the carbon grid after the peak. On the other hand, compared with the RC specimens, the stiffness of the TRC specimens was sharply lowered due to cracks, resulting in greater deflection at the same load. Although the maximum loads of the TRC specimens were larger than those of the RC specimens, the TRC specimens exhibited brittle behavior due to strand fracture after the peak. In this paper, based on the experimental results, the load-deflection relationship of the TRC structure was modeled as a bilinear curve in which the stiffness changes around the crack initiation point, and to calculate the stiffness after crack initiation, an equation that applied a reduction factor to the cracked transformed moment of inertia was proposed. The stiffness after cracking according to the proposed formula was larger than that to the experimental results, but the overall load-deflection relationship was shown to be able to be simulated."
Sharing용 ESS의 CMV 발생 메커니즘 및 모델링에 관한 연구,2023,"['Sharing ESS', 'Common Mode Voltage', 'Stray Capacitance', 'Lighting Surge', 'PSCAD/EMTDC', 'Mechanism of CMV']","최근, 전기자동차의 폐배터리를 재활용한 Sharing용 ESS 서비스 실증사업이 활발하게 진행되고 있는데, 이러한 Sharing용 ESS는 빈번하게 이동하여 수용가 계통에 연계되므로 CMV를 포함한 전기적 위해요인의 안전성에 대한 대응 방안이 요구되고 있다. 따라서, 본 논문에서는 Sharing용 ESS를 대상으로 다양한 요소에 의한 CMV 발생 메커니즘을 제시하고, 이를 바탕으로, 배전계통 상용해석 프로그램을 이용하여 Sharing용 ESS의 CMV 모델링을 수행하고, 각 CMV 발생메커니즘에 따른 특성을 평가한다. 상기에서 제시한 메커니즘과 모델링을 바탕으로 시뮬레이션을 수행한 결과, Sharing용 ESS의 PCS에 설치된 IGBT와 방열판 사이의 기생커패시턴스가 증가할수록 IGBT 스위칭에 의한 CMV의 크기가 증가하고, 배터리측의 보호기기가 동작하면 매우 큰 CMV가 서지 형태로 발생하여 ESS 구성품의 절연을 파괴할 가능성이 있으며, 연계용 변압기 2차측의 결선방식이 Y결선일 경우, CMV의 크기가 전기설비기준의 절연레벨을 초과하여 배터리측의 절연레벨에 악영향을 미칠 수 있음을 알 수 있다. 또한, 연계용 변압기의 결선방식에 대하여 외함접지를 고려할 경우, 외함접지를 고려하지 않은 경우보다 CMV가 약 16배 정도 더 크게 발생함을 알 수 있고, 높은 뇌서지에 장기간 노출될 경우, 배터리측의 절연성능에 악영향을 줄 가능성이 있음을 알 수 있다.","Recently, a demonstration project of a shared ESS service using re-used EV(electric vehicle) batteries has been actively promoted. Countermeasures for safety hazards including CMV are required since a shared ESS frequently interconnects with a customer system. Therefore, this paper presents mechanisms of CMV due to diverse factors in a shared ESS. Based on the proposed mechanisms, we performed modeling of CMV in a shared ESS and evaluated the characteristics of CMV. From the simulation result based on the proposed mechanisms and modeling, it was confirmed that the CMV due to IGBT switching increases along with the magnitude of stray capacitance between an IGBT and heatsink in PCS. CMV may also breakdown the insulation of ESS components when protection devices on the battery side are operated. When the wiring method of the secondary side of a grid-connected transformer is a Y connection, the CMV may negatively influence the insulation level of the battery. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the CMV with consideration of enclosure grounding was 16 times more than that without the consideration, and the insulation on the battery side may be negatively influenced when the battery is exposed to the CMV caused by a lightning surge for a long time."

He also lamented the decline of the literary style of his time and  emphasized the need for a changes the writings in the public domain, such as chuánjiào(傳敎), pànfù(判付), and zhāngzòu(章奏), which as well. To achieve this, King Jeongjo compiled and published various books, particularly focusing on the creation of Guǎngéwén that promoted various policies and highlighted the dignity of the royal court. During one's crown prince days, he compiled the 󰡔Sawon-yeonghwa(詞苑英華)󰡕 by selecting exemplary styles from official documents, and later published the 󰡔Munwonbobul(文苑黼黻)󰡕 by expanding and embodying various literary styles, serving as a model for first academician. He also attempted to establish the boundaries of Guǎngéwén and standardize their format while compiling the 󰡔Munwonbobul󰡕. He defined official documents as writings composed in the court, specifically categorized according to their form and function, with the king or crown prince as the sender, excluding contents closely related to practical matters, and emphasized their sophistication and ceremonial nature. He also attempted to standardize their format by modifying some aspects during the process of transcribing them.Additionally, King Jeongjo engaged in numerous debates with his courtiers regarding Guǎngéwén. He established the true lineage of official document writers through the works of Gwon Geun(權近), Byeon Gye-ryang(卞季良), Seo Geujeong(徐居正), Yi Jeong-gwi(李廷龜), Nam Yong-ik(南龍翼), and Song Sang-gi(宋相琦), and explained what Guǎngéwén should ultimately aspire to, praising a plain and simple style, practical content that discerns the rise and fall of the times, and a profound understanding of sentence structure that pursues change. In order to revitalize the literary style, King Jeongjo presented examples and styles of Guǎngéwén, selected and trained talented individuals, but when this did not yield significant results, he implemented a literary policy. However, when the styles of the courtiers responsible for writing in the public domain, such as Guǎngéwén, were met with derogatory terms like ‘Chāoqǐ-tǐ(抄啓體)’ and ‘Kuígé-tǐ(奎閣體)’, a conservative attitude towards literature emerged, leading to a focus on Confucian classics in the literary policy."
"Spreading rate, opening time, and kinematic history of the Ayu Trough",2023,"['Ayu Trough', 'Philippine Sea Plate', 'spreading rate', 'sedimentation rate', 'mid-ocean ridge basalts', 'rare earth elements', 'global plate reconstruction']",,"The Ayu Trough, located in the equatorial western Pacific, is the only divergent boundary surrounding the Philippine Sea Plate. A mid-ocean ridge spreading in the N-S direction near low-latitude regions presents low geomagnetic anomalies, thereby complicating the constraining of the trough’s spreading rate based on the geomagnetic signal from the magnetized seafloor. According to previous studies, the Ayu Trough has been open since ~25 Ma, with a half-spreading rate of 4.1–8.1 mm/yr. This implies that the trough belongs to the ultraslow-spreading mid-ocean ridge category with a full-spreading rate below 20 mm/yr. However, the geochemical signatures of the rock samples from the Ayu Trough do not exhibit the unique characteristics of ultraslow-spreading ridges, including the enriched mid-ocean ridge basalts (E-MORB) with high rare earth element (REE) concentrations and abundant light rare earth elements (LREE). Rather, the sampled rocks from the entire trough-axis exhibit the typical features of the normal mid-ocean ridge basalts (N-MORB) with low REE concentrations. The contradictory inferences made from geochemical results suggest that theAyu Trough did not undergo an ultraslow-spreading but rather a considerably rapid spreading over a short period compared to the estimates made by previous studies. The modified interpretation for the spreading rate of the Ayu Trough can be associated with the global plate reconstruction model, considering the major plate reorganization in East Asia. Around 15 Ma, a series of significant tectonic events occurred in East Asia and the western Pacific. The global models for East Asia imply that the spreading of the Ayu Trough could have been initiated afterwards. Based on our geochemical analysis of the MORB on the Ayu Trough and the global plate model, we argue that the spreading of the Ayu Trough was initiated after ~15 Ma during the major plate reorganization in East Asia, and not in ~25 Ma as reported by previous studies. Therefore, the spreading occurred only for a period of about 10 Myr at a relatively rapid full-spreading rate of > 20 mm/yr. The massive sediments with a thickness of approximately 50–70 m on the spreading-axis of the Ayu Trough reinforce the estimated cessation time of the trough. In addition, the V-shaped seafloor of the Ayu Trough and the unclear transform fault may be interpreted as topography formed by a propagation of rift or mantle melting. Therefore, the trough does not have to be simultaneously opened throughout the axis, and its spreading rate could be higher than previously estimated."

Based on this, the article reveals the importance of liberal arts education as a new life ‘ars’ in the post-labor society that will come with artificial intelligence. Simondon's technical mentality and technical culture reveal a new model of post-labor existence that enables people to organize their work and public activities alongside AI, rather than in competition with it. Stiegler embodies Simondon's outlook by calling for a transformation of the crisis of labor and spirit caused by the algorithmic governmentality of Automatic Society into an opportunity for the invention of new kind of knowledge and work. The era of intelligent automation shifts the paradigm of life from labor productivity and expertise to post-labor and liberal arts. We need to cultivate life ‘ars’ so that the time freed from labor due to automation can be used to take care of our own lives and the lives of others, inherit our cultural traditions, and produce new values. Liberal arts education should move toward fostering digital literacy with a humanistic outlook in order for us to understand the human condition of living in an automated technological environment and to discover the value of the human spirit and the meaning of human life."

A simulation of fault analysis in the hybrid MVDC distribution system was done based on the modeling for a fault scenario. The results confirmed that the fault current characteristics of a single ground fault is reduced by about 47% according to the simulation condition, and the short circuit current is rapidly increased up to 18.5kA. The protection device setting values of the AC distribution feeder were determined by considering the grounding of the transformer in a converter and inverter station and the NGR in the main transformer in order to stably operate the hybrid MVDC distribution system."

In particular, the concept of folk song and the examination of the expansion of the research category were particularly focused on the field.It is difficult to find a case in which intense discussions have been held on the proper method of folk song research in the study of folk songs. In order to overcome these problems, it is necessary to change the perspective of paying attention to folk songs as a culture following the law of time as a cycle rather than the law of time as an arrow by the law of evolutionary competition. In addition, it was thought that folk song studies from now on, such as research methods that advance to folklore and culture through folk song sites, should start anew from an integrated perspective of culture and folklore. Therefore, it should be media folk songs using new technologies, consilience folk songs as communication that contributes to the development of society and culture, comparative folk songs that compare with folk songs from other regions, and digital folk songs for content production.The expanded view of the folk song scene(field) was considered to provide a basis for categorizing and examining the natural scene, conservation scene, performance scene, popular song scene, content scene, and pseudo scene, and each expanded folk song scene was analyzed. In other words, the field of performance or transmission of folk songs, the field of preservation of folk songs that maintains, preserves, and inherits the original form of folk songs, the field of performance that mainly deals with the problem of transformation rather than the original form or model of folk songs, and the field of popular songs, rather than original form, type, and transformation It was mentioned that there are folk song content sites and cyber folk song sites where the problem of utilization is an issue. It was expected that the folk song scene in virtual reality could be reproduced far richer and more realistically than the folk song scene much earlier than now, and demanded a response to this.This expansive recognition of the folk song scene means that it is possible to differentiate and approach the folk song scene from the past to the future, from reality to virtual, from singing culture to content culture, and from community to society."

The purpose of the study is to explore the variable characteristics of origami and present the possibility of a multi-purpose 3D printed textile structure that can be used as a bag in two dimensions and packaging and objects in three dimensions. For the study, we understand the concept and characteristics of origami based on literature research and Internet searches, and explore examples of textile design that applies the variable characteristics of origami and 3D printing textile design that combines existing fibers. And by combining basic origami designs extracted from books and 3D printing them on mesh fabric, we explore the variable structure of textiles for versatility. The results of the study are as follows. First, as a result of analyzing textile design cases using origami, it was difficult to find practical examples in both the unfolded flat state and the folded three-dimensional state, and it was found that most single products were folded in one direction. Second, we 3D modeled four origami patterns that fold in different directions, 3D printed them on mesh fabric, and practiced the folding structure by connecting the top or left and right sides of the fabric. And by combining different patterns by 3D printing two or more origami patterns on a single piece of fabric, the possibility of structural transformation was presented, which is expected to function as a bag in two dimensions and as a packaging in three dimensions. Third, the fusion of PLA material and mesh fabric complemented the material characteristics of flexibility and sturdiness, making it suitable for use as origami-applied packaging and bags. The significance of the research lies in the idea of developing the possibility of a versatile textile structure using the variability of origami for environmentally friendly use."

In the world of comics, the potential of AI technology has been garnering attention, leading to an exploration of its application in comic education to verify its educational effectiveness. In the 'Cartooning' course, students were assigned two versions of tasks: one using traditional methods and the other utilizing AI technology. Starting with a basic understanding of AI image generation technology, the course progressed with foundational learning about AI each week. Over the four-week course, students initially faced challenges with AI technology but gradually became accustomed to it, actively employing it in their creations, and showing increased satisfaction. The application of AI generation technology in comic creation demonstrated various educational effects. Firstly, it contributed to enhancing students' creative thinking. Students could develop more creative thinking skills by transforming their characters from images to text. Secondly, it helped improve technical skills. Utilizing AI technology, students learned prompt writing and compared different model outputs, naturally enhancing their technical abilities. Thirdly, it strengthened self-expression skills. Students were able to enhance their ability to express themselves by depicting their ideas and characteristics in images, which also allowed them to discover new perspectives about themselves. Fourthly, it enabled creative activities from diverse viewpoints. Students compared each other's work, understanding and accepting different perspectives. Lastly, it fostered artistic sensitivity. By comparing various styles of outcomes, students could develop richer artistic sensibilities. Despite these benefits, the application of AI technology in comics and webtoons still faces ethical issues like copyright infringement and the potential for unauthorized use, necessitating deeper contemplation and the search for alternatives in the future."

In the mid-1920s, a new generation of Kampo practitioners led a revival of Kampo use in Japan. Particularly following the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese Kampo community, aligned with Japan’s external aggressive policies during that period, employed Kampo as a tool for cultural influence in China and sought to win the hearts and minds of the Chinese people. They aspired to foster collaboration within East Asia, leading to the emergence of ‘Oriental Medicine’ discourse. They sought to leverage the unique circumstances of wartime to rejuvenate and revitalize Kampo.  The trends in Japanese Kampo are disseminated through networks of individuals centered around the East Asian Medical Association, influencing regions including Korea, Manchukuo, and inner China. In Korea, notable figures like colonial official scholar Sakihara Tokuha championed this approach. In parallel with the Japanese Kampo community, they advocated for ‘Oriental Medicine.’ In contrast to the previous strategy of ‘eliminating physicians but retaining the medicines,’ they advocated the establishment of Traditional Korean Medicine(TKM) hospitals and TKM research institutes in Korea, along with comprehensive studies on TKM itself. Sakihara Tokuha’s viewpoints served as a clear reflection of the shifts in Japan’s colonial TKM policies during this era.  The ‘ambition’ of the Japanese medical community to revive Kampo found its earliest success in Manchukuo. With the involvement of figures from the Japanese Kampo community and Sakihara Tokuha, Manchukuo officially recognized the status of TCM, introduced TCM examinations, instituted TCM hospitals and research centers, and established formal educational institutions for TCM. It is worth noting, however, that these series of reform measures in Manchukuo were essentially modeled after the new style of TCM from Japan and thus became a historical opportunity to transform traditional East Asian medicine and proliferate Japanese-style Kampo."

Paying attention to the nature of the local university innovation project as an educational plan, this study attempted a theoretical review of the ‘local experience’ of local learners, a fundamental problem that had been overlooked in previous discussions, and suggested future directions. Methods To this end, this study critically examines recent environmental changes and issues surrounding local universities, and attempts a conceptual examination of the ‘local experience’ of learners at local universities, which is a fundamental problem that has been overlooked in existing policy approaches to local universities. In addition, based on this series of discussions, by presenting domestic and foreign cases that are achieving university innovation by considering the ‘local experience’ of learners as a relatively exemplary model, focusing on the ‘local experience’ of learners, local learners, local universities, and the community It was intended to suggest a policy direction for practical contribution to development. Results Based on the discussion, this study proposes directions for regional university innovation based on the learners' local experiences. The proposed directions include: 1) Suggestions for enabling local learners to settle in the region and meaningfully utilize the tangible and intangible assets of the region. 2) Suggestions for utilizing the holistic experience of society, economy, and culture in the formation of mutually beneficial relationships among various stakeholders. 3) Suggestions for transforming learners' local experiences into practical needs within the local community. Conclusions In order for policies related to local university innovation to be implemented in an educationally desirable direction in a win-win structure with various institutions, it is essential to consider the ‘local experience’ of local university learners. This study is meaningful in that it tries to raise a new problem from an educational point of view for the regional university innovation policy, which has been carried out from an existing administrative and political point of view."

Women's entrepreneurial autobiographies are a distinct form of entrepreneurial narrative that emerges under different conditions compared to those of male entrepreneurs. The autobiographies of Jang Young-sin and Jo An-ri employ different gender strategies in constructing their entrepreneurial identities. Jang Young-sin's autobiography, shaped by her involvement in business through spousal succession, presents a distinct leadership style as a female entrepreneur that contrasts with the authoritative and patriarchal leadership associated with male entrepreneurs. It narrates how her experiences in nurturing and motherhood became the seeds of her entrepreneurial capabilities. On the other hand, Jo An-ri's autobiography foregrounds impulsive passions and the emotions of love, which have often been dismissed as “irrational,” and bestows upon them the capacity for entrepreneurial adventure and exploration, imbuing them with meaning and value.In contrast to male entrepreneurial autobiographies, which often simplify or make invisible the realm of intimate emotions and the private space of the home, these women's entrepreneurial autobiographies emphasize the experiences in the personal sphere and impulsive passions as the primary seeds for subsequent entrepreneurial capabilities. Moreover, an ideal entrepreneurial identity is constructed around these aspects. These dimensions hold significant importance for these authors in terms of securing the legitimacy of their entrepreneurial lives and self-assertion. Jang Young-sin, following her husband's death, transitioned from a housewife to the head of the family business through spousal succession within the structure of a family- owned enterprise. Jo An-ri, after marrying a foreign clergyman and facing societal condemnation, left Korea and ventured into business to achieve economic independence. These autobiographies create a meaningful and valuable model that justifies the entrepreneurial lives of female authors who started as “inherited widows” and “marginal men” engaging in challenging entrepreneurship.However, the autobiographies of Jang Young-sin and Jo An-ri can also be seen as narratives of the lives of the “elite ruling class” who have succeeded in wealth accumulation and class reproduction within Korean society. In Jang Young-sin's autobiography, the process of succession is narrativized as part of a universal gender struggle. Furthermore, her “extraordinary success” is portrayed as the manifestation of accumulated capabilities within the domestic sphere. These aspects make her autobiography more akin to a gendered version of strong individualism. In Jo An-ri's autobiography, the “capital flowing across borders,” driven by multinational corporations and state power during the 1980s and 1990s, is represented as a humanized form of capital, bracketing its power and class attributes, appearing as a “warm” and “alive” entity. Within the narrative of love and business, capital and the economy are also transformed into the realm of “warm emotions.” The more “femininity” is emphasized in these autobiographies, the more these women position themselves as “elite entrepreneurs” with entrepreneurial capabilities rather than simply being labeled as “women.” As they emphasize their gender identity, they assume the position of the “economic ruling class.” This can be seen as a paradoxical gendered self-expression in women's entrepreneurial autobiographies that reproduces class and justifies economic wealth.In the 1990s, the autobiographies of Jang Young-sin and Jo An-ri narrativized their entrepreneurial lives at the intersection of gender and class. These narratives oscillated between providing an altern..."

These wholes can be divided into individual cognitive elements, and the brain can process information in this mechanism. We only perceive beauty as a whole without knowing what the components and structures are, and as a result, it is challenging to reproduce beauty through these. But the brain has evolved over a long period to have the intelligence to reduce the whole to multiple levels, and neuroscience has shown the process well. In addition, recently, active artificial intelligence has imitated it and succeeded in reproducing beauty.In this study, visual stimuli were reduced and organized into six levels of intelligence through prior research in cognitive neuroscience. First, the retina converts light into electrical pixel data, which is transmitted to the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN). Information arriving from the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus to the V1 area is rapidly transferred to the cognitive areas of the brain through the IFOF channel, causing visual attention. In order to respond quickly to the state of the world, a map of spatial visual coordinates is formed in the sensory and perceptual states as a mechanism for attending to objects. Second, primary visual processing reduced the attended visual stimuli to Feature, and the secondary visual cortex was reduced by processing visual information in Element, Shape, and From. Next, the structure of the connections between the visually reduced elements and the affective domain was examined, and it was found that the domain processing the From had a higher density of opioid receptors that elicited positive affect. Then, these visually reductive elements are converted into vocabularies, and a proposition is generated to translate them into Modellings. The generated vocabulary and propositions are used to create a beautiful design using the artificial intelligence Midjourney. Finally, the research on the goodwill of the beautiful shape is carried out, which further verifies the feasibility of this study.This study is based on cognitive neuroscience, which reduces beauty as a whole to visual stimuli. The possibility of recognizing the design is verified by the beautiful reproduction of artificial intelligence. That is, an attempt is made to transfer the process of understanding and to reproduce the structure of beauty from the feeling of beauty to the category of recognition and to solve the difficulties encountered in producing beauty."

However, the CDE (Common Data Environment) system, which is an essential element for operating BIM, has not been established in accordance with the domestic situation. To solve this problem, this study analyzed the results of previous studies, including the ISO 19650 standard and domestic CDE system requirements, and developed BIM-based collaboration functions that are suitable for the domestic construction industry through functional analysis of domestic and foreign commercial CDE solutions. And we developed a BIM collaboration framework to provide BIM-based collaboration functions as a service by using cloud technologies such as IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS to provide infrastructure resources flexibly and flexibly. The BIM collaboration framework developed in this study meets most of the CDE requirements of ISO1965, so it can secure competitiveness when bidding for overseas BIM projects. Also, because the BIM collaboration functions can be selectively applied to build a BIM-based collaboration platform, it is expected that the utilization of the BIM collaboration framework will be high, as it can minimize not only the time to build the platform but also the operating costs, and the usability is higher than that of existing commercial BIM CDE solutions."

The subject of this study was employees working at a general hospital-level medical institution with more than 300 beds, and a survey was conducted using a structured questionnaire. SPSS 26.0 and AMOS 26.0 SEM (Structural Equation Modeling) analysis were performed on the 323 collected cases. As a result of the study, it was found that transactional leadership and emotional leadership had a significant effect on job satisfaction, and the higher the job satisfaction, the higher the organizational commitment. And transactional leadership had a significant effect on loyalty, and loyalty increased as job satisfaction and organizational commitment increased. Job satisfaction affected loyalty through organizational commitment. In addition, in the moderating effect analysis, gender, position, age, education, and service period had a significant effect, but positions and departments were not statistically significant. This study is meaningful in that medical institutions have identified the relationship between employee job satisfaction and organizational commitment according to leadership style and analyzed the effect on loyalty."

FIV response analysis of cylinder with hollow section placed in tandem at the rear of upstream cylinder by numerical simulation,2023,['· Computational modeling · Cylinders in tandem · Hollow cylinder · Wake-induced vibration'],,"The flow-induced vibration of a circular cylinder with a hollow section that is mounted at the rear is investigated in this work via numerical simulation. The Reynolds number was limited in the range of 6918-1511 by using reduced velocity that corresponds to Ur = 2-12.Five typical center-to-center distance ratios L/D of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 and three hollow section positions of left bias, up bias, and middle of cylinder were selected. The displacement time history curve and short-time Fourier transform diagram show that when L/D = 3 and Ur = 3, the cylinder with the hollow position in the middle initially entered the main frequency vibration for 5.64 s, but when L/D = 4 and Ur = 6, the drag coefficient time history curve of the cylinder biased to the left and up at the hollow position demonstrated a ""beating"" phenomenon, and multiple frequency peaks appeared on the fast Fourier transform diagram."

In current research, truss design is typically undertaken by designers, and a significant amount of research has focused on structural analysis. Furthermore, with the emerging issues of low productivity in the construction industry and an aging workforce, there is an increasing emphasis on research in smart construction. This study emphasized the importance of generative design and its application in automating truss structure design methodologies. This paper proposes a three-step process (Step 1: Basic Truss Structure, Step 2: Truss Design Transformation with Generative Design, and Step 3: Advanced Truss Structure with the Integration of Non-linear Algorithms) utilizing visual programming techniques to evaluate the complexities of truss structure design. As a result, this study introduced a novel approach to examine the feasibility of using generative design in truss structural design. The results reveal an alternative to enhance and supplement conventional structural design methods."
Indirect Method for Estimation of Reference Intervals of Inflammatory Markers,2023,"['Reference range', 'Latent variable modeling', 'Statistical data interpretation', 'Statistical distributions']",,"Background: The direct method for reference interval (RI) estimating is limited due to the requirement of resources, difficulties in defining a non-diseased population, or ethical problems in obtaining samples. We estimated the RI for inflammatory biomarkers using an indirect method (RII).Methods: C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and presepsin (PSEP) data of patients visiting a single hospital were retrieved from April 2009 to April 2021. Right-skewed data were transformed using the Box-Cox transformation method. A mixed population of non-diseased and diseased distributions was assumed, followed by latent profile analysis for the two classes. The intersection point of the distribution curve was estimated as the RI. The influence of measurement size was evaluated as the ratio of abnormal values and adjustment (n×bandwidth) of the distribution curve.Results: The RIs estimated by the proposed RII method (existing method) were as follows: CRP, 0–4.1 (0–4.7) mg/L; ESR, 0–10.2 (0–15) mm/hr and PSEP, 0–411 (0–300) pg/mL. Measurement sizes ≥2,500 showed stable results. An abnormal-to-normal value ratio of 0.5 showed the most accurate result for CRP. Adjustment values ≤5 or >5 were applicable for a measurement size <25,000 or ≥25,000, respectively.Conclusions: The proposed RII method could provide additional information for RI verification or estimation with some limitations."

Experimental Research on the Microstructure and Strength Characteristics of Tailings Paste Containing Wate Reducer,2023,"['Gold tailings', 'Paste', 'Water reducer', 'Microstructure', 'Numerical modeling', 'Strength']",,"In order to study the effect of polycarboxylate superplasticizer (PCE) on the microstructure and strength characteristics of tailings paste, a total of 6 tailings paste combinations including 2 cement-sand ratios (20%, 40%) and 3 water reducer dosages (0, 0.40%, 0.80%) were investigatedbased on the indoor microstructure test (porosity measurement, XRD test, and SEM observation) and mechanical properties method. The strength of test blocks at different ages was obtained by numerical simulation. The results showed that: 1) The water reducer can effectively reduce the porosity of the tailings paste, and the reduction effect was more significant in the condition of high cement-sand ratios. Meanwhile, high cement-sand ratio is conductive to generate more beneficial hydrates such as portlandite; 2) Compared with the significant effect of cementitious agent on the tensile strength σt of the paste, the effect of water reducer on σt is weak. Accordingly, the σt of the tailings paste is much more sensitive to cementitious agent than water reduce; 3) SEM images show that the better ratio of slurry containing polycarboxylic acid superplasticizer has more C-S-H cementitious content, smaller pore size and shorter molecular chain between particles, indicating that the particles are more encapsulated and the early strength is improved. 4) The incorporation of water reducer enhancement was particularly significant under the condition of triaxial compression. However, the presence of water reducer did not change its deformation characteristics, when the confining pressure is low, the strain softening appears; and when the confining pressure is high, it transforms to strain hardening. The peak strain ε0 and the confining pressure σ3 had a linear relationship; 5) The strength of the paste was significantly affected by the confining pressure σ3 under different conditions. The peak intensity σ1 and the confining pressure σ3 satisfieda linear relationship, while the residual strength σr and the confining pressure σ3 satisfied a quadratic polynomial fitting relationship. The strength parameters cohesion c and internal friction angle ϕ were both positively correlated with the water reducer dosage."

D-PSM 시스템에 입력된 사업장 모든 정보는 데이터베이스화하고, 실시간 데이터 공유를 통해 자동으로 갱신된다. 또한, 화학공장의 3D 모델링의 시각화를 통해 근로자의 편의성 및 안전성을 높였고, 중·소규모 사업장의 디지털트윈 기반의 안전관리 체계를 구축하는데 기여할 것으로 기대된다.","In Korea, the process safety management (PSM) system is currently implemented to prevent accidents such as release of hazardous substances or fires and explosions in hazardous facilities. Since all 12 components of the PSM must be changed if one component is modified, there is a significant time and economic burden; thus, factories are continuously demanding the digitization of PSM. Therefore, in this study, we developed digital-process safety management (D-PSM) that can program a relational database management system (RDBMS) based on the core elements of PSM and access it in a network method. All information input into the D-PSM system for the factory is digitized and automatically updated in real-time through data sharing. In addition, the visualization of 3D modeling for chemical factories improves the convenience and safety of workers and is expected to contribute to the establishment of a digital twin-based safety management system for small- and medium-sized factories."
