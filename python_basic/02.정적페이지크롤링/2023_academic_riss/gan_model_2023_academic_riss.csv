Limited Discriminator GAN using explainable AI model for overfitting problem,2023,['GANDiscriminatorGeneratorOverfittingExplainable AI'],,"Data-driven learning is the most representative deep learning method. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are designed to generate sufficient data to support such learning. The learning process of GAN models typically trains a generator and discriminator in turn. However, overfitting problems occur when the discriminator depends excessively on the training data. When this problem persists, the image created by the generator shows a similar appearance to the learning image. Images similar to learning images eventually lose the meaning of data augmentation. In this paper, we propose a limited discriminator GAN (LDGAN) model that explains the results of GAN, which is a model that can not be analyzed externally, such as a black box. The part explained in LDGAN becomes the discriminator model of GAN, and it is possible to check which area of the image is used as the basis for determining fake/real by the discriminator. In the end, a method for limiting the learning of discriminator is proposed based on the described results. Through this, it is possible to avoid the overfitting problem of the discriminator and to generate various images different from the learning image. The LDGAN method allows users to perform meaningful data augmentation with only specific objects except for complex images or backgrounds that require analysis. Compare the LDGAN method with the existing DCGAN and present the extensive simulation results. The extensive simulation result shows that the image generated by the proposed LDGAN including the estimation area is about 10% more."
치아 보철물 디자인을 위한이미지 대 이미지 변환 GAN 모델,2023,"['Dental prosthesis design', 'Generative AI', 'Image', 'GAN']",,"Traditionally, tooth restoration has been carried out by replicating teeth using plaster-based materials. However, recent technological advances have simplified the production process through the introduction of computer-aided design(CAD) systems. Nevertheless, dental restoration varies among individuals, and the skill level of dental technicians significantly influences the accuracy of the manufacturing process. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an approach to designing personalized tooth restorations using Generative Adversarial Network(GAN), a widely adopted technique in computer vision. The primary objective of this model is to create customized dental prosthesis for each patient by utilizing 3D data of the specific teeth to be treated and their corresponding opposite tooth. To achieve this, the 3D dental data is converted into a depth map format and used as input data for the GAN model. The proposed model leverages the network architecture of Pixel2Style2Pixel, which has demonstrated superior performance compared to existing models for image conversion and dental prosthesis generation. Furthermore, this approach holds promising potential for future advancements in dental and implant production."

Therefore, ground roll suppression is a crucial step in seismic data processing. Several techniques, such as f-k filtering and curvelet transform, have been developed to suppress the ground roll. However, the existing methods still require improvements in suppression performance and efficiency. Various studies on the suppression of ground roll in seismic data have recently been conducted using deep learning methods developed for image processing. In this paper, we introduce three models (DnCNN (De-noiseCNN), pix2pix, and CycleGAN), based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), for ground roll suppression and explain them in detail through numerical examples. Common shot gathers from the same field were divided into training and test datasets to compare the algorithms. We trained the models using the training data and evaluated their performances using the test data. When training these models with field data, ground roll removed data are required; therefore, the ground roll is suppressed by f-k filtering and used as the ground-truth data. To evaluate the performance of the deep learning models and compare the training results, we utilized quantitative indicators such as the correlation coefficient and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) based on the similarity to the ground-truth data. The DnCNN model exhibited the best performance, and we confirmed that other models could also be applied to suppress the ground roll."

First, a CM noise model is developed using a linear equivalent circuit that consists of a voltage source, current source, and two noise impedances. The behavioral parameters of the CM model are then extracted by changing the input-side shunt impedances. A GaN HEMT buck converter setup is then built using switching frequencies of 100 kHz, 200 kHz, and 500 kHz to verify the validity of the CM EMI behavioral model. A comparison between the experimental and predicted results indicated that the proposed CM EMI model of GaN-based power converters was able to predict well the CM EMI current in the 150 kHz–30 MHz frequency range."
SRPAttention-GAN 기반 고해상도 철근 이미지 생성을 통한 철근 끝점 검출 성능 향상,2023,"['rebar endpoint', 'srgan', 'cbam', 'high-resolution image generation', 'yolov5', '.']","현재 철근공장의 가공 공정에서 발생하는 불량품 생산을 최소화를 위한 무인 자동화 연구가 진행되고 있다. 선행 연구에서는 YOLOv3 기반의 비전 카메라를 이용한 철근 이미지의 끝점을 검출하고 철근의 꼬임 유무를 파악하려 하였으나, 철근 가공 현장에서의 노이즈로 인해 이미지 품질이 저하되어 딥러닝 모델의 검출 성능이 감소하였다. 이에 본 논문에서는 이런 문제를 해결하기 위해 새로운 모델 SRPAttention-GAN을 제안한다. SRPAttention-GAN 모델은 저해상도의 철근 이미지를 고해상도 이미지로 변환하여 YOLOv5 모델에 학습시켜 검출 성능을 높인다. 실험 결과 SRPAttention-GAN 모델은 기존의 SRResNet-GAN 모델에 비해 PSNR이 약 0.3dB 더 높아졌음을 확인하였다. 또한, 원본 이미지와 제안 모델에서 생성한 이미지를 YOLOv5에 학습시켜 F1과 정밀도에서 더욱 개선된 결과를 얻을 수 있었으며, 이를 통해 철근의 끝점 검출 정확도를 향상시켰다.","Many studies are currently underway on unmanned automation to reduce the production of defective products during the machining process in rebar factories. In previous studies, a vision camera using YOLOv3 was employed to detect the endpoint of rebar images and determine whether the rebar was twisted. However, the quality of the images deteriorated due to noise occurring at the rebar processing site, resulting in decreased detection performance by the deep learning model. In this paper, we propose a novel model called SRPAttention-GAN. This model transforms low-quality rebar images into high-resolution images and trains the YOLOv5 model to enhance detection performance. Experimental results confirmed that the PSNR of the SRPAttention-GAN model was approximately 0.3db higher than the existing SRResNet-GAN model. Furthermore, by training YOLOv5 on both the original images and the images generated by the proposed model, we were able to obtain improved results on the F1 and Precision, thereby enhancing the accuracy of rebar endpoint detection."

This problem is not only for discriminative models, but also for generative models, such as GAN. The Generative Replay method, which is frequently used in GAN continual learning, uses images generated by GAN provided in the previous task together for learning new tasks, but does not generate good images for CIFAR10, which is a relatively challenging task. Therefore, we can consider a rehearsal-based method that stores a portion of the real data, which cannot store a huge amount of images in limited memory because of large dimension of the real image. In this paper, we propose LactoGAN and LactoGAN+, continual learning methods that store latent vectors that are the inputs of GANs rather than storing real images, as the existing rehearsal-based approaches. As a result, more image knowledge can be stored in the same memory; thus, showing better results than the existing GAN continual learning methods."

It then introduces stress factors crucial for a life test and categorizes approaches found in the literature for assessing device lifetimes, comparing each test condition and result using a graph.Results: Across the literature, temperature-accelerated stress tests were predominant for deriving the mean time to failure (MTTF), commonly applying the Arrhenius model. On average, less than 20 samples are used, with a test duration of approximately 2000 hours and a test channel temperature above 150 degrees Celsius. Consequently, the activation energy (Ea) exceeds 1 eV, estimating the MTTF to be over 105 hours.Conclusion: In radio frequency (RF) applications, GaN HEMTs, when considering degradation causes, are suitably evaluated for lifetime using the RF method to simulate real-world environments while applying stress due to voltage and temperature. Accordingly, a future consensus on an integrated approach to lifetime evaluation for these devices is needed."

Estimation of switching losses considering non‑linear parasitic capacitances of GaN E‑HEMT,2023,"['Gallium nitride (GaN)', 'Non-linear', 'Parasitic capacitance', 'Switching loss', 'Curve fitting', 'Datasheet']",,"The power loss estimation of a gallium nitride enhancement-mode high electron mobility transistor (GaN E-HEMT) is necessary to optimize a thermal model of a power conversion system. However, many manufacturers do not provide a switching energy in their datasheets. To estimate switching energy using information provided in the datasheet, the parasitic capacitance of the GaN E-HEMT is utilized. The switching loss of the GaN E-HEMT can be easily obtained with a conventional method. However, this process does not consider nonlinearity of the parasitic capacitance, which results in large errors and makesthermal model optimization impossible. This paper proposes an enhanced switching loss calculation model considering the non-linear parasitic capacitances of a GaN E-HEMT. To obtain accurate switching energy, a second-order exponential function using regression analysis is used to model the non-linear parasitic capacitance of the GaN E-HEMT. A theoretical analysis of the proposed method has been discussed. Then a double pulse test (DPT) has been performed to verify the proposed method. The proposed method almost corresponds to the experimental results within ± 20%, and it provides a simple and intuitive capacitance model."

Airfoil GAN: encoding and synthesizing airfoils for aerodynamic shape optimization,2023,"['deep learning', 'generative adversarial network', 'airfoil design', 'design optimization']",,"The current design of aerodynamic shapes, like airfoils, involves computationally intensive simulations to explore the possible design space. Usually, such design relies on the prior definition of design parameters and places restrictions on synthesizing novel shapes. In this work, we propose a data-driven shape encoding and generating method, which automatically learns representations from existing airfoils and uses the learned representations to generate new airfoils. The representations are then used in the optimization of synthesized airfoil shapes based on their aerodynamic performance. Our model is built upon VAEGAN, a neural network that combines Variational Autoencoder with Generative Adversarial Network and is trained by the gradient-based technique. Our model can (1) encode the existing airfoil into a latent vector and reconstruct the airfoil from that, (2) generate novel airfoils by randomly sampling the latent vectors and mapping the vectors to the airfoil coordinate domain, and (3) synthesize airfoils with desired aerodynamic properties by optimizing learned features via a genetic algorithm. Our experiments show that the learned features encode shape information thoroughly and comprehensively without predefined design parameters. By interpolating/extrapolating feature vectors or sampling from Gaussian noises, the model can automatically synthesize novel airfoil shapes, some of which possess competitive or even better aerodynamic properties as compared to airfoils used for model training purposes. By optimizing shapes on the learned latent domain via a genetic algorithm, synthesized airfoils can evolve to target aerodynamic properties. This demonstrates an efficient learning-based airfoil design framework that encodes and optimizes the airfoil on the latent domain and synthesizes promising airfoil candidates for required aerodynamic performance."

A state-of-the-art solution to overcome this limitation is by using a GAN Discriminator to imitate motion data clips and incorporating reinforcement learning to compose goaloriented motions. In this paper, our research aims to create characters performing combat sports such as boxing, using a novel reward design in conjunction with existing GAN-based approaches. We experimentally demonstrate that both the Adversarial Motion Prior [3] and Adversarial Skill Embeddings [4] methods are capable of generating viable motions for a character punching a random target, even in the absence of mocap data that specifically captures the transition between punching and locomotion.

Constant on‑time variable frequency control for critical conduction mode GaN‑based totem‑pole PFC converters,2023,"['Constant on-time', 'Feed-forward', 'Critical conduction mode', 'Voltage-second principle']",,"A constant on-time variable frequency control (COTVFC) with feed-forward for a critical conduction mode (CRM) totempole power factor correction (PFC) converter is proposed in this paper. This control method only requires a single voltage loop, where the output is taken as the on-time of the main switches of the converter. The off-time of the main switches in different switching cycles is calculated by the voltage-second balance principle, which ensures that the converter always operates in the CRM. Feed-forward is introduced to improve the dynamic response of the converter. The control model is established and the transfer function from the on-time to the output is derived. On this basis, the control parameters of the voltage loop are designed. Then a simulation model is built in PSIM for simulation verification. Finally, a two-phase interleaved parallel GaN-based totem-pole PFC converter prototype is made for experimental verification. Simulation and experimental results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the control method proposed in this paper."

Inpainting GAN-Based Image Blending with Adaptive Binary Line Mask,2023,"['Image Blending', 'Image Inpainting', 'Composite Image', 'Generative Adversarial Network.']",,"Image blending is a scheme for image composition to make the composite image looks as natural and realistic as possible. Image blending should ensure that the edges of the object look seamless and do not distort colors. Recently, numerous studies investigated image blending methods adopting deep learning-based image processing algorithms and contributed to generating natural blended images. Although the previ-ous studies show remarkable performance in many cases, they suffer from quality drop when blending incompletely cropped object. This is because partial loss and unnecessary extra information on the cropped object image interferes with image blending. This paper proposes a new scheme that significantly reduce the unnatural edges and the color distortion. First, to detect and handle the incompletely cropped region, an adaptive binary line mask generation utilizing color difference checking algorithm (CDC) is proposed. The generated mask is exploited to im-prove image blending performance by isolating incompletely cropped image edges from image blending. Second, in order to perform inpaint-ing the missing or masked area of the object image and image blending together, the inpainting generative adversarial model is adopted. Exper-imental results show that the blended images are not only more natural than those of the previous works but the color information is also well preserved."

We numerically investigated the optical and electrical properties of UV-LEDs with a graded last quantum barrier (LQB). The constant content Aluminium (Al) of the LQB is replaced by a graded Al profile to improve the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) in the active MQWs region. The results show that the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and radiative recombination rate of UV μLEDs with the last linearly increased Al composition LQB are higher than other samples under 90 A/cm 2 current. This composition also contributes to enhanced hole injection efficiency, effective electron confinement, and uniform distribution of carriers in the MQWs caused by the low electrostatic field. As a result, the optical output power is increased 1.94 times, and the spontaneous emission intensity 2.37 times. The simulated results indicate that the LQB AlGaN layer with different compositions of Al modification can mitigate the effect of the effective electron confinement, Auger recombination rate and hole injection, increasing the overlap between electron ditribution profiles."

To mitigate the bias in model training, we derive values for the dependent variables using random forests and deep neural networks, enriching the training datasets. These datasets are integrated with existing data to form comprehensive solar irradiance prediction models. The experimentation revealed that the augmented datasets led to significantly improved model performance compared to those trained solely on the original data.Specifically, CTGAN showed outstanding results due to its sophisticated mechanism for handling the intricacies of multivariate data relationships, ensuring that the generated data are diverse and closely aligned with the real-world variability of solar irradiance.

In this study, to increase detection reliability even for small objects, the resolution of drone images that can secure high resolution and economic efficiency was improved through super-resolution.

Since babies mainly express their status through the pattern of crying sounds, research to classify the baby's status through voice is being actively conducted. Most of the studies that classify the baby's condition identified the baby's condition with a clean baby voice without noise.However, the baby's voice data collected in the real environment is likely to contain noise inside. Therefore, it is necessary to process the noise in the voice data. This paper proposes MCycle GAN (Multiple Cycle Generative Adversarial Net), which is a cycle GAN-based deep learning model for noise processing. MCycle GAN is a model in which multiple cycles are arranged in the existing Cycle GAN for more precise noise processing. The discrimination performance of the discriminator is improved by learning the adversarial relationship between a large number of generators and a small number of discriminators, and the generator needs to generate more precise forged data to deceive the discriminator. As a result of the experiment, the MCycle GAN model takes more training time than Cycle, but it showed stronger discriminant discrimination performance and generator forged data generation performance.

Efficiency Enhanced Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network via Advanced Knowledge Distillati,2023,"['Knowledge Distillation', 'Generative Adversarial Network', 'Super-Resolution', 'Model Lightweight']",,"Super-resolution (SR) stands as a prominent challenge in computer vision with diverse applications.Generative adversarial networks (GANs) yield impressive SR outcomes by restoring high-quality images from low-resolution input. However, GAN-based SR (particularly generators) have high memory demands, leading to performance degradation and energy consumption, making them unsuitable for resource-limited devices. Addressing this concern, our paper introduces a novel and efficient SR-GAN (generator) model architecture by strategically leveraging knowledge distillation, which results in reducing storage demands by 58% while enhancing performance. Our approach involves extracting feature maps from a resourceintensive model to design a lightweight model with minimal computational and memory requirements.Experiments across several benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed compressed model outperforms existing knowledge distillation-based techniques, particularly in regard to SSIM, PSNR, and overall image quality in x4 super-resolution tasks. In the future, this compressed model will be implemented and benchmarked with existing models in resource-limited devices such as tablet and wearing devices."

ISFRNet: A Deep Three-stage Identity and Structure Feature Refinement Network for Facial Image Inpainting,2023,"['Deep Learning', 'Image Inpainting', 'GAN']",,"Modern image inpainting techniques based on deep learning have achieved remarkable performance, and more and more people are working on repairing more complex and larger missing areas, although this is still challenging, especially for facial image inpainting. For a face image with a huge missing area, there are very few valid pixels available; however, people have an ability to imagine the complete picture in their mind according to their subjective will. It is important to simulate this capability while maintaining the identity features of the face as much as possible. To achieve this goal, we propose a three-stage network model, which we refer to as the identity and structure feature refinement network (ISFRNet). ISFRNet is based on 1) a pre-trained pSp-styleGAN model that generates an extremely realistic face image with rich structural features; 2) a shallow structured network with a small receptive field; and 3) a modified U-net with two encoders and a decoder, which has a large receptive field. We choose structural similarity index (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), L1 Loss and learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) to evaluate our model. When the missing region is 20%-40%, the above four metric scores of our model are 28.12, 0.942, 0.015 and 0.090, respectively. When the lost area is between 40% and 60%, the metric scores are 23.31, 0.840, 0.053 and 0.177, respectively. Our inpainting network not only guarantees excellent face identity feature recovery but also exhibits state-of-the-art performance compared to other multi-stage refinement models."

Finally, it is verified by simulation experiments. The results show that the method can achieve smoother path, smaller parking space and more ideal parking posture, meet the requirements of stability, safety and comfort in the process of parallel parking, and improve the ability of parallel parking.

Super-resolution Reconstruction of Transitional Boundary Layers Using a Deep Neural Network,2023,"['Super-resolution reconstruction', 'Transitional boundary layer', 'Turbulent boundary layer', 'Deep neural network', 'Generative adversarial network']",,"Numerical simulations of turbulent flow require excessive computational resources due to the multi scale characteristics of turbulence. Thus, a technique to reconstruct a high-resolution flow field from a coarse flow data can be helpful. For this purpose, various artificial neural-network-based super-resolution methods have been developed in recent years. Although previous studies reported that the super-resolution methods show remarkable performance for turbulent channel flow and homogeneous isotropic turbulence, its application for spatially developing flow with laminar, transitional, and turbulent characteristics has not been reported. In the present study, a super-resolution reconstruction method applicable for spatially developing laminar-transition-turbulent flow is developed by training the network for boundary layer flow with bypass transition. In addition, the generalization of the network for boundary layer flow with natural transition and for fully turbulent boundary layer flow is attempted. A super-resolution method based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) is employed for the study as it shows the best performance among tested network models. It is found that the developed method successfully reconstructs flow structures in transitional and early turbulent regions. In addition, statistics such as the mean velocity and the power spectral density of velocity from recovered fields show good agreement to those of DNS. Notably, the GAN model which is only trained for the bypass transition is also found to be applicable to boundary layer flow with K-type natural transition and fully developed turbulent boundary layers."

In order to preserve more attributes of the original image and reduce the changes of facial skin color and texture features caused by the above de-recognition algorithm's operation on the whole facial area, this paper proposes a privacy protection model of face image based on generative adversarial network and facial feature analysis. Our model realizes face recognition based on changing the original image as little as possible. Specifically, we identify and extract features from fixed parts in face images, including eyes, nose, mouth, eyebrows, and cheeks. Then, we designed a face privacy recognition and protection model based on conditional generative adversarial networks.

Applying Pix2pix to Translate Hyperemia in Blood Pool Image into Corresponding Increased Bone Uptake in Delayed Image in Three-Phase Bone Scintigraphy,2023,['Bone scintigraphy · Arthritis · Complex regional pain syndrome · Artificial intelligence · Image-to-image translation'],,"Purpose Delayed images may not be acquired due to severe pain, drowsiness, or worsening vital signs while waiting afterblood pool imaging in three-phase bone scintigraphy. If the hyperemia in the blood pool image contains information fromwhich increased uptake on the delayed images can be inferred, the generative adversarial network (GAN) can generate theincreased uptake from the hyperemia. We attempted to apply pix2pix, a type of conditional GAN, to transform hyperemiainto increased bone uptake.Methods We enrolled 1464 patients who underwent three-phase bone scintigraphy for inflammatory arthritis, osteomyelitis,complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), cellulitis, and recent bone injury. Blood pool images were acquired 10 minafter intravenous injection of Tc-99 m hydroxymethylene diphosphonate, and delayed bone images were obtained after 3 h.The model was based on the open-source code of the pix2pix model with perceptual loss. Increased uptake in the delayedimages generated by the model was evaluated using lesion-based analysis by a nuclear radiologist in areas consistent withhyperemia in the blood pool images.Results The model showed sensitivities of 77.8% and 87.5% for inflammatory arthritis and CRPS, respectively. In osteomyelitisand cellulitis, their sensitivities of about 44% were observed. However, in cases of recent bone injury, the sensitivitywas only 6.3% in areas consistent with focal hyperemia.Conclusion The model based on pix2pix generated increased uptake in delayed images matching the hyperemia in the bloodpool image in inflammatory arthritis and CRPS."

감각치환을 위한 소리 기반 감정 표현 얼굴 생성 연구,2023,"['Visual to Auditory', 'Generative Model', 'Multi-Modal', 'GANs']",,"Research on Visual-to-Auditory (V2A) which uses neural facilitation to transfer visual information to auditory information is actively ongoing.

To provide more information to the users, it is necessary to generate and transmit augmented visual information by integrating it with other sensory information. Recently, methods for generating augmented visual information by integrating auditory and visual information are being studied, but there is a drawback in that they cannot generate images optimized for sound intensity by not considering the rich intensity of sound. To solve this problem, in this paper, a method of classifying sound and converting the classified result into sound intensity to generate images optimized for sound intensity is proposed. The results of applying the proposed method to a face image generation model in experiments showed that the proposed method can generate face images utilizing sound information when sound intensity is considered."
Neutrophil-inspired photothermo-responsive drug delivery system for targeted treatment of bacterial infection and endotoxins neutralization,2023,"['Neutrophil membrane', 'Photothermal', 'Endotoxin neutralization', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Drug delivery']",,"Background P. aeruginosa, a highly virulent Gram-negative bacterium, can cause severe nosocomial infections, and it has developed resistance against most antibiotics. New therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to treat such bacterial infection and reduce its toxicity caused by endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS). Neutrophils have been proven to be able to target inflammation site and neutrophil membrane receptors such as Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) and CD14, and exhibit specific affinity to LPS. However, antibacterial delivery system based on the unique properties of neutrophils has not been reported.Methods A neutrophil-inspired antibacterial delivery system for targeted photothermal treatment, stimuli-responsive antibiotic release and endotoxin neutralization is reported in this study. Specifically, the photothermal reagent indocyanine green (ICG) and antibiotic rifampicin (RIF) are co-loaded into poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NP-ICG/RIF), followed by coating with neutrophil membrane to obtain antibacterial delivery system (NM-NP-ICG/RIF).The inflammation targeting properties, synergistic antibacterial activity of photothermal therapy and antibiotic treatment, and endotoxin neutralization have been studied in vitro. A P. aeruginosa-induced murine skin abscess infection model has been used to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the NM-NP-ICG/RIF.Results Once irradiated by near-infrared lasers, the heat generated by NP-ICG/RIF triggers the release of RIF and ICG, resulting in a synergistic chemo-photothermal antibacterial effect against P. aeruginosa (~ 99.99% killing efficiency in 5 min). After coating with neutrophil-like cell membrane vesicles (NMVs), the nanoparticles (NM-NP-ICG/RIF) specifically bind to inflammatory vascular endothelial cells in infectious site, endowing the nanoparticles with an infection microenvironment targeting function to enhance retention time. Importantly, it is discovered for the first time that NMVs-coated nanoparticles are able to neutralize endotoxins. The P. aeruginosa murine skin abscess infection model further demonstrates the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of NM-NP-ICG/RIF.Conclusion The neutrophil-inspired antibacterial delivery system (NM-NP-ICG/RIF) is capable of targeting infection microenvironment, neutralizing endotoxin, and eradicating bacteria through a synergistic effect of photothermal therapy and antibiotic treatment. This drug delivery system made from FDA-approved compounds provides a promising approach to fighting against hard-to-treat bacterial infections."
Enhanced Adversarial Attack for Avoidance of Fake Image Detection,2023,"['Multimedia forensics', 'anti-forensic attacks', 'deep learning', 'generative adversarial network']",,"Image forensics is one of the most emerging topics in multimedia forensics to ensure the integrity of image content. Anti-forensic (AF) attacks, particularly generative adversarial network (GAN)-based attacks on fake images, can make forensic methods vulnerable. However, the effectiveness of AF attacks is limited to certain training conditions such as datasets, forensic methods, and attack types. Even though an AF attack is applied to misguide the forensic methods, forensic methods can be again updated using the AF dataset, which continues an infinite loop. This paper proposes an improved AF attack that can misguide all forensic methods. We update the forensic methods multiple times with multiple AF datasets and build an AF model that learns different forensic methods updated at different times. The experiments show that the proposed AF attack successfully deceives all forensic methods."
계층별 트랜스포머를 활용한 비선형 스타일 결합 기반 생성적 스타일 변환 기법,2023,"['Transformer', 'Style mixing', 'Stylization']","Stylization은 주어진 이미지를 원하는 특정 스타일로 변환하는 기술이다. 초기의 연구에서는 그래디언트를이용한 연구가 진행되었으나, 최근에는 고품질의 얼굴 이미지 생성이 가능한 생성 모델의 발전으로, 생성망을 활용한 stylization 기술이 발전되어왔다. 이 중 JoJoGAN은 GAN inversion을 통해 찾아낸 참조 스타일의 잠재 벡터와 임의의 노이즈의 가중합 통해 fine-tuning이 가능한 학습 과정을 소개했으며, 한 장의 참조 이미지만을 사용해 우수한 스타일 변환이 가능함을 보였다. 하지만 기존 가중합 기반 스타일 결합은 단순 선형 결합 형태로써 스타일 코드를 표현하는 매니폴드가 제한되는 문제점을 갖는다. 따라서 해당 잠재공간을 활용한 stylization 결과물은 미세한 표현을 효과적으로 반영하지 못함과 동시에 다양성에서 한계를 갖는다. 이러한 문제점을 해결하고자 본 논문에서는 두 가지 방법을 제안한다. 첫 번째로 다양성과 생성 품질을 높이기 위한 비선형적 스타일 결합으로써 스타일 잠재 공간을 폭 넓게 구성하는 방법이다. 이는 확장된 스타일 공간에서의 다양한 샘플링을 가능하게 함으로써 결과물의 품질 및 다양성을 향상시킨다. 두 번째로 스타일 결합에 있어서 공간적 장기 의존성을 파악해 의미 있는 스타일 특징의 조합을 만들어낼 수 있도록 계층별 Transformer 구조를 활용했다. 즉, coarse, middle, fine 계층에 대해 별도로 독립적인 신경망을 두어 스타일 코드를 인코딩한다. 제안하는 방법을 통해 전체적 외형은 원본의 외형을 따르도록 하고 미세영역에 대해 참조 스타일을 반영하도록 유도함으로써, 정량적/정성적/주관적 실험 결과를 통해 개선된 stylization 성능을 확인했다.","Stylization is the method of transforming a given image into a specific desired style. In early studies, studies using gradients were conducted, but recently, stylization using generative networks have been developed along with the development of a generative model capable of generating high-quality facial images. Among them, JoJoGAN introduced a learning process that enables fine-tuning through the weighted sum of the reference style latent vector and random noise found through GAN inversion and showed that excellent style transformis possible using only one reference image. However, the existing weighted sum-based style combination has a problem in that the manifold expressing the style code is limited as a simple linear combination form. Therefore, the result of stylization using the potential space does not reflect the fine expression effectively and at the same time has a limit in diversity. To solve this problem, this paper proposes two methods. First, it is a method to broadly compose a style latent space by combining non-linear stylization to increase the diversity and quality of creation. This allows for different sampling in an expanded style space, improving the quality and variety of the output. Second, we used a hierarchical Transformer structure to identify spatial long-term dependencies in style combinations to generate meaningful combinations of style features. In other words, style codes are encoded by separate independent neural networks for coarse, medium and fine layers. In the proposed method, improved stylization performance was confirmed through quantitative/qualitative/subjective experiments by inducing the overall appearance to follow the original appearance and to reflect the reference style for fine details."
Restoration of Ghost Imaging in Atmospheric Turbulence Based on Deep Learning,2023,"['Atmospheric turbulence', 'Deep learning', 'Generative adversarial network', 'Ghost imaging']",,"Ghost imaging (GI) technology is developing rapidly, but there are inevitably some limitations such as the influence of atmospheric turbulence.

With a compressed sensing (CS) algorithm and generative adversarial network (GAN), the image can be restored well. We analyze the performance of correlation imaging, the influence of atmospheric turbulence and the restoration algorithm’s effects. The restored image’s peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index map (SSIM) increased to 21.9 dB and 0.67 dB, respectively. This proves that deep learning (DL) methods can restore a distorted image well, and it has specific significance for computational imaging in noisy and fuzzy environments."

Enhancing Low-light Images for Monocular Visual Odometry in Challenging Lighting Conditions,2023,"['Deep learning', 'generative adversarial network', 'low-light image enhancement', 'style transfer', 'visual odometry.']",,"Visual odometry (VO) estimates the robot’s current position based on feature matching or brightness variation between images, making it primarily suitable for well-lit environments with good image quality. Consequently, existing visual odometry methods exhibit degraded performance in low-light or highly dynamic environments, limiting their operational efficiency in outdoor settings. To overcome these challenges, research has been conducted to enhance low-light images to improve odometry performance. Recent advancements in deep learning have facilitated extensive research on image enhancement, including low-light conditions. Utilizing generative adversarial networks (GANs) and techniques like CycleGAN, researchers have achieved robust improvements in various lighting conditions and enhanced odometry performance in low-light environments. However, these methods are typically trained on single images, compromising the structural consistency between consecutive images. In this paper, we propose learning-based low-light image enhancement and the preservation of structural consistency between consecutive images for monocular visual odometry. The proposed model utilizes the CycleGAN approach for domain transformation between different illumination levels, effectively avoiding the failure of visual odometry in low-light environments. To handle diverse lighting conditions within images, a local discriminator is employed to enhance local brightness. Additionally, a structure loss is introduced using sequence images to ensure structural consistency between the original and generated images. This method simultaneously improves low-light conditions and preserves structural consistency, leading to enhanced visual odometry performance in low-light environments."
