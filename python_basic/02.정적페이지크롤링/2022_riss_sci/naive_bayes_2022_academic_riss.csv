Fish Freshness Identification Using Machine Learning: Performance Comparison of k-NN and Naïve Bayes Classifier,2022,"['Fish freshness identification', 'Machine learning', 'Fisheye images', 'Computer science', 'k-NN', 'Naive Bayes']",,"Fish is one of the food sources that should be examined for freshness before being consumed. The consumption of rotten fish can cause various diseases. The rotten fish have changed color on the gills, skin, flesh, and eyes and have a pungent odour. Fish freshness can be assessed using a variety of conventional methods, but these methods have limitations, such as requiring relatively expensive equipment and trained personnel and being destructive. We use machine learning because it is non-destructive, reduces costs, and is easy to use. This study aims to identify the freshness of fish using k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and Naïve Bayes (NB) classification methods based on the fish-eye image. The features used in the classification process are RGB and GLCM. The research stages consist of the fish collection process, image acquisition and class division, preprocessing and ROI detection, feature extraction and dataset split, and the classification process. The results show that the k-NN method has better performance than NB with average accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and AUC of 0.97, 0.97, 0.97, 0.97, and 0.97, respectively."

Machine learning for the prediction of preclinical airway management in injured patients: a registry-based trial,2022,"['Intratracheal intubation', 'Machine learning', 'Bayes theorem', 'Wounds and injuries', 'Decision trees']",,"Objective The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of using machine learning to establish the need for preclinical airway management for injured patients based on a standardized emergency dataset.Methods A registry-based, retrospective analysis was conducted of adult trauma patients who were treated by physician-staffed emergency medical services in southwestern Germany between 2018 and 2020. The primary outcome was to assess the feasibility of using the random forest (RF) and Naive Bayes (NB) machine learning algorithms to predict the need for preclinical airway management. The secondary outcome was to use a principal component analysis to determine the attributes that can be used and advanced for future model development.Results In total, 25,556 adults with multiple injuries were identified, including 1,451 patients (5.7%) who required airway management. Key attributes were auscultation, injury pattern, oxygen therapy, thoracic drainage, noninvasive ventilation, catecholamines, pelvic sling, colloid infusion, initial vital signs, preemergency status, and shock index. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was between 0.96 (RF; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96–0.97) and 0.93 (NB; 95% CI, 0.92–0.93; P<0.01). For the prediction of airway management, RF yielded a higher precision-recall area than NB (0.83 [95% CI, 0.8–0.85] vs. 0.66 [95% CI, 0.61–0.72], respectively; P<0.01).Conclusion To predict the need for preclinical airway management in injured patients, attributes that are commonly recorded in standardized datasets can be used with machine learning. In future models, the RF algorithm could be used because it has robust prediction accuracy."

A close second was KcBERT (55.77%)followed by KoBERT (54.91%). The performances of naïve Bayes and logistic regression classifiers were 52.52% and 50.28% respectively. Dueto the scarcity of training data and the imbalance in class distribution, the overall prediction performance was not high for all classifiers.Moreover, the classifiers’ vocabulary did not explicitly capture the error features that were helpful in correctly grading the Korean essay.By overcoming these two limitations, we expect the score range prediction performance to improve."

An optimized technique for copy–move forgery localization using statistical features,2022,"['CMFD', 'Copy paste forgery detection', 'Image cloning detection', 'SPT', 'GLCM', 'OSVM']",,"Copy–Move Forgery Detection (CMFD) helps to detect copied and pasted areas in one image. It plays a crucial role in legal evidence, forensic investigation, defence, and many more places. In the proposed CMFD method, a two-step identification of forgery is presented. In step one, the suspected image will be classified into either one of two classes that are forged or authentic. Step two is carried out​ only if the suspected is classified as forged, then forged location will be identified using the block-matching procedure. Initially, the suspected image is decomposed into different orientations using Steerable Pyramid Transform (SPT); Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features are extracted from each orientation. These features are used to train Optimized Support Vector Machine (OSVM) as well as to classify. If the suspected image is categorized into forged, then the suspected grey image is converted into overlapping blocks, and from each block, GLCM features are extracted. The proper similarity threshold value and distance threshold value can locate the forged region using GLCM block features. The performance of the proposed method is tested using standard datasets CoMoFoD and CASIA Datasets. The proposed CMFD approach results are consistent, even the forged image suffered from attacks like JPEG compression, scaling, and rotation. The OSVM classifier is showing superiority over the Optimized Naive Bayes Classifier (ONBC), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)."

One wayto cope with a fall accident is to determine the fall direction before impact using a wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU).In this context, a previous study proposed a method of classifying fall directions using a support vector machine with sensorvelocity, acceleration, and tilt angle as input parameters. However, in this method, the IMU signals are processed throughseveral processes, including a Kalman filter and the integration of acceleration, which involves a large amount of computationand error factors. Therefore, this paper proposes a machine learning-based method that classifies the fall direction before impact using IMU raw signals rather than processed data. In this study, we investigated the effects of the followingtwo factors on the classification performance: (1) the usage of processed/raw signals and (2) the selection of machine learning techniques. First, as a result of comparing the processed/raw signals, the difference in sensitivities between the two methods was within 5%, indicating an equivalent level of classification performance. Second, as a result of comparing sixmachine learning techniques, K-nearest neighbor and naive Bayes exhibited excellent performance with a sensitivity of86.0% and 84.1%, respectively."
