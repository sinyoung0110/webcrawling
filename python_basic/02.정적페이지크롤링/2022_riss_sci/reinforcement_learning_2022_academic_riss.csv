Applying Deep Reinforcement Learning to Improve Throughput and Reduce Collision Rate in IEEE 802.11 Networks,2022,"['Contention window threshold', '(CW<sub>Threshold</ sub>)', 'deep Q-learning network (DQN)', 'deep reinforcement learning (DRL)', 'smart exponential-threshold-linear backoff algorithm with deep Q-learning network (SETL-DQN)', 'wireless networks']",,"The effectiveness of Wi-Fi networks is greatly influenced by the optimization of contention window (CW) parameters. Unfortunately, the conventional approach employed by IEEE 802.11 wireless networks is not scalable enough to sustain consistent performance for the increasing number of stations. Yet, it is still the default when accessing channels for single-users of 802.11 transmissions. Recently, there has been a spike in attempts to enhance network performance using a machine learning (ML) technique known as reinforcement learning (RL). Its advantage is interacting with the surrounding environment and making decisions based on its own experience. Deep RL (DRL) uses deep neural networks (DNN) to deal with more complex environments (such as continuous state spaces or actions spaces) and to get optimum rewards. As a result, we present a new approach of CW control mechanism, which is termed as contention window threshold (CW<sub>Threshold</sub>). It uses the DRL principle to define the threshold value and learn optimal settings under various network scenarios. We demonstrate our proposed method, known as a smart exponential-threshold-linear backoff algorithm with a deep Q-learning network (SETL-DQN). The simulation results show that our proposed SETL-DQN algorithm can effectively improve the throughput and reduce the collision rates."
Reinforcement learning multi-agent using unsupervised learning in a distributed cloud environment,2022,"['Cloud', 'Reinforcement Learning', 'Clustering', 'Unsupervised Learning', 'Data Anlaysis']",,"Companies are building and utilizing their own data analysis systems according to business characteristics in the distributed cloud. However, as businesses and data types become more complex and diverse, the demand for more efficient analytics has increased. In response to these demands, in this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning-based data analysis agent to which reinforcement learning is applied for effective data analysis. The proposal agent consists of reinforcement learning processing manager and unsupervised learning manager modules. These two modules configure an agent with k-means clustering on multiple nodes and then perform distributed training on multiple data sets. This enables data analysis in a relatively short time compared to conventional systems that perform analysis of large-scale data in one batch."
Fault-tolerant control system for once-through steam generator based on reinforcement learning algorithm,2022,"['Once-through steam generator', 'Reinforcement learning', 'DQN algorithm', 'Incremental action']",,"Based on the Deep Q-Network(DQN) algorithm of reinforcement learning, an active fault-tolerance method with incremental action is proposed for the control system with sensor faults of the oncethrough steam generator(OTSG). In this paper, we first establish the OTSG model as the interaction environment for the agent of reinforcement learning. The reinforcement learning agent chooses an action according to the system state obtained by the pressure sensor, the incremental action can gradually approach the optimal strategy for the current fault, and then the agent updates the network by different rewards obtained in the interaction process. In this way, we can transform the active fault tolerant control process of the OTSG to the reinforcement learning agent's decision-making process. The comparison experiments compared with the traditional reinforcement learning algorithm(RL) with fixed strategies show that the active fault-tolerant controller designed in this paper can accurately and rapidly control under sensor faults so that the pressure of the OTSG can be stabilized near the set-point value, and the OTSG can run normally and stably"

Optimization is done through reinforcement learning of charging and discharging schedule of energy storage systems according to the unit of electricity pricing rates as well as a reduction of peak power demand to save electricity pricing. To do this, modeling of urban railway systems including energy storage systems, electricity pricing rates, and changes in rates according to operations of energy storage systems are carried out. Reinforcement learning for an agent is also done to reduce peak power demand through DQN algorithm.Operation data of actual lines of urban railways operating with energy storage systems are utilized for learning.

Thus, a path planning method based on prioritized deep reinforcement learning is proposed in the paper. The core idea of the method is that the robot first builds an environment mathematical model based on the obtained information through the sensors. Then, to make the robot can obtain the optimal search policy in an extremely complex environment, the prioritized replay mechanism is used to improve deep reinforcement learning. Finally, the simulation results show that the search path planning method based on prioritized deep reinforcement learning proposed can not only improve the convergence speed of the model but also is endowed good robustness in this paper."

Currently, rule-based EMSs and optimizationbased EMSs are faced with the challenge when considering the optimality and the real-time performance of the control at the same time. Along with the rapid development of the artificial intelligence, learning-based EMSs have gained more and more attention recently, which are able to overcome the above challenge. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based EMS is proposed for fuel cell hybrid buses (FCHBs) in this research, in which the fuel cell durability is considered and evaluated based on a fuel cell degradation model. The action space of the DRL algorithm is limited according to the efficiency characteristic of the fuel cell in order to improve the fuel economy and the Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) is adopted for improving the convergence performance of the DRL algorithm. Simulation results of the proposed DRL-based EMS for an FCHB are compared to those of a dynamic programming (DP)-based EMS and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based EMS.

PEDESTRIAN COLLISION AVOIDANCE USING DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING,2022,"['Pedestrian collision avoidance', 'Autonomous driving', 'Deep reinforcement learning', 'Car Learning to Act (CARLA)', 'Deep Q- Network (DQN)']",,"The use of intelligent systems to prevent accidents and safety enhancement in vehicles is becoming a requirement. Besides, the development of autonomous cars is progressing every day. One of the main challenges in transportation is the high mortality rate of vehicles colliding with pedestrians. This issue becomes severe due to various and abnormal situations. This paper proposes a new intelligent algorithm for pedestrian collision avoidance based on deep reinforcement learning. A deep Q-network (DQN) is designed to discover an optimal driving policy for pedestrian collision avoidance in diverse environments and conditions. The algorithm interacts with the vehicle and the pedestrian agents and uses a specific reward function to train the model. We have used Car Learning to Act (CARLA), an open-source autonomous driving simulator, for training and verifying the model in various conditions. Applying the proposed algorithm to a simulated environment reduces vehicles and pedestrians’ collision by about 64 %, depending on the environment. Our findings offer an early-warning solution to mitigate the risk of a crash of vehicles and pedestrians in the real world."

However, during the plugging process, the flow field around the IPT changes drastically, resulting in vortex-induced vibration and potential failure of the plugging operation. In this study, three foldable spoilers were designed at the tail of the IPT to optimize the flow field. The vibration of the IPT can be alleviated by adjusting the angles of the spoilers. A vibration reduction control system of the IPT was designed based on deep reinforcement learning. First, we conducted an experiment for vibration reduction system. Second, a nonlinear model of the pressure difference based on experimental data was established. Then, a multi-agent self-learning system based on the deep Q-network (DQN) was designed, and the optimal actions were selected in each agent to adjust the spoiler angles during the plugging process. Finally, a controller based on fuzzy reinforcement learning was proposed to flip the spoilers to the optimized angles. The results show that the vibration reduction control system of the IPT reduced the pressure difference by an average of 28.32%, which indicates the stability of the plugging process and a successful reduction of the IPT vibration."

Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Edge Caching in Heterogeneous Networks,2022,"['Edge Caching', 'Heterogeneous Networks', 'Reinforcement Learning']",,"With the increasing number of mobile device users worldwide, utilizing mobile edge computing (MEC) devicesclose to users for content caching can reduce transmission latency than receiving content from a server or cloud.However, because MEC has limited storage capacity, it is necessary to determine the content types and sizesto be cached. In this study, we investigate a caching strategy that increases the hit ratio from small base stations(SBSs) for mobile users in a heterogeneous network consisting of one macro base station (MBS) and multipleSBSs. If there are several SBSs that users can access, the hit ratio can be improved by reducing duplicate contentand increasing the diversity of content in SBSs. We propose a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based caching strategythat considers time-varying content popularity and content redundancy in multiple SBSs. Content is stored inthe SBS in a divided form using maximum distance separable (MDS) codes to enhance the diversity of thecontent. Experiments in various environments show that the proposed caching strategy outperforms the othermethods in terms of hit ratio."

In the pre-initialization framework, well-designed power distribution-related rules are used to pre-initialize the Q-table of the RL algorithm to expedite its optimization process. Driving cycles are modeled as Markov processes and the FCS power difference between adjacent moments is used to evaluate the impact on the FCS lifetime in this research. The proposed RL-based EMS is trained on three driving cycles and validated on another driving cycle. Simulation results demonstrate that the average fuel consumption difference between the proposed EMS and the EMS based on dynamic programming is 5.59% on the training driving cycles and the validation driving cycle. Additionally, the power fluctuation on the FCS is reduced by at least 13% using the proposed EMS compared to the conventional RL-based EMS which does not consider the FCS lifetime. This is significantly beneficial for improving the FCS lifetime. Furthermore, compared to the conventional RL-based EMS, the convergence speed of the proposed EMS is increased by 69% with the pre-initialization framework, which presents the potential for realtime applications."
Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews using Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning,2022,"['Sentiment Analysis', 'Deep Reinforcement Learning', 'Product Review', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Machine Learning']",,"The existing model for sentiment analysis of product reviews learned from past data and new data was labeled based on training.

Explicit Dynamic Coordination Reinforcement Learning Based on Utility,2022,"['Reinforcement Learning', 'Multi-agent System', 'Explicit Coordination Learning', 'Utility Dependence', 'Intelligent Vehicle']",,"Multi-agent systems often need to achieve the goal of learning more effectively for a task through coordination. Although the introduction of deep learning has addressed the state space problems, multi-agent learning remains infeasible because of the joint action spaces. Large-scale joint action spaces can be sparse according to implicit or explicit coordination structure, which can ensure reasonable coordination action through the coordination structure. In general, the multi-agent system is dynamic, which makes the relations among agents and the coordination structure are dynamic. Therefore, the explicit coordination structure can better represent the coordinative relationship among agents and achieve better coordination between agents. Inspired by the maximization of social group utility, we dynamically construct a factor graph as an explicit coordination structure to express the coordinative relationship according to the utility among agents and estimate the joint action values based on the local utility transfer among factor graphs. We present the application of such techniques in the scenario of multiple intelligent vehicle systems, where state space and action space are a problem and have too many interactions among agents. The results on the multiple intelligent vehicle systems demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed methods."

Actor-Critic reinforcement learning for optimal design of piping support constraint combinations,2022,"['Actor-Critic (AC)', 'Finite Element Method (FEM)', 'Markov Decision Process (MDP)', 'Markov Process (MP)', 'Monte-Carlo (MC)', 'Temporal-Difference (TD)']",,"Piping systems operating under various conditions may cause extremely unstable structural stress and deformation, leading to permanent deformation and damage to the piping structure, bringing about serious safety problems. So, piping stress analysis shall be performed along with proper design. Meanwhile, structural instability due to local stress concentration, which is one of the main interests of stress analysis, can be resolved through the appropriate selection of constraint conditions of piping supports at a relatively low cost. However, selecting an appropriate combination of constraints is time-consuming because analysis results are derived through many iterations. In addition, there is a big difference in the quality of the final design according to the experiences and capabilities of engineers. As a solution to this situation, this paper introduces a reinforcement learning strategy for deriving the optimal combination of constraints of piping supports. Primarily, we suggest applying the Actor-Critic(AC) learning algorithm for this problem, which is a type of reinforcement learning that has recently been in the spotlight for this problem because it can evaluate an action policy directly by the on-policy method inside the AC algorithm. During learning, it traces the correspondence between State and Action and suggests appropriate labeling criteria. We present the suitability and usefulness of the algorithm applied to the pipe stress analysis procedure through comparative verification between the results derived from the well-trained AC model and the results accomplished by engineers."

The paper proposes a distributed Pareto reinforcement learning (DPRL) based on game theory to address the multi-objective control problem (MOCP) of SGC of multi-area interconnected power systems (MAIPSs). The proposed DPRL consists of the framework of reinforcement learning and multiple Q matrices, which can provide multiple outputs for MOCPs. As a control algorithm based on the Markov decision process, the stability of the proposed approach can be guaranteed with the ability to provide dynamic control strategies online. With the Pareto concept of optimization algorithms introduced into a control algorithm, the proposed approach can obtain multiple comprehensive objectives. The case studies under the two-area and practical four-area power systems show that: compared with four reinforcement learning methods and a proportional-integral controller, the proposed DPRL can achieve the highest control performance with multiple objectives in MAIPSs. The case studies of SGC under two MAIPSs verify the feasibility and eff ectiveness of the DPRL for MOCPs."

Improvement of Dynamic Window Approach Using Reinforcement Learning in Dynamic Environments,2022,"['Dynamic window approach (DWA)', 'mobile robot', 'obstacle avoidance', 'reinforcement learning.']",,"In environments where dynamic or unknown obstacles exist, a robot needs to use collision avoidance algorithms to protect itself and provide personal safety. Recently, many researchers have used machine learning techniques to study obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments. However, these studies are insufficient for providing a velocity model for actual driving because of the limited number of motions and parameters tuning according to environmental changes. This paper proposes an algorithm that combines the dynamic window approach (DWA) and deep reinforcement learning to build a velocity model to avoid obstacles. This method adds and subtracts the linear and angular velocities of the robot from the DWA calculations using the designed learning module. Through this configuration, many robotic motions can be generated even with limited action functions. In our experiments, the application of this learning module showed a 23.7% higher rate of obstacle avoidance than with DWA alone. The experimental results verified that the proposed method improved the performance of obstacle avoidance for multiple dynamic environments without any additional work. It has been confirmed that this method can be applied to real robots as well."

The environment provided by the IDMS provides a cumulative optimal reward for each action based on the policy of the learning process. Most actions involve interacting with a given IDMS environment; therefore, it can provide the following elements: a starting agent state, multiple obstacles, agent goals, and a cluttered index. The reward in the environment is also reflected by RL-based agents, in which agents can move randomly or intelligently to reach their respective goals, to improve the agent learning performance. We extend different cases of intelligent multi-agent systems from our previous works: (a) a proposed environment-clutter-based-index for agent sub-goal selection and analysis of its effect, and (b) a newly proposed RL reward scheme based on the environmental clutter-index to identify and analyze the prerequisites and conditions for improving the overall system."

Since a surface vessel is decoupled by kinematic sub-system and dynamic sub-system, the cascade control system is an ideal method for obtaining the tracking problem. In the proposed control structure, the dynamic control loop is designed to be the optimized method of the corresponding dynamic sub-system and the kinematic control loop is implemented by a nonlinear controller combining with feed-forward term. The online actor-critic architecture is considered in ARL algorithm to overcome the challenge of solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Additionally, the proposed controller is able to handle the difficulty of the non-autonomous optimal control problem by designing the ARL technique for the corresponding system with a small number of state variables.

During block lifting, if a block is not carefully controlled, it will cause damage. Block lifting using crane operation is performed by controlling the number of wires, hooks, and equalizers. Consequently, predicting stable block lifting is difficult. In this study, we proposed a control method to determine static equilibrium. Initially, an algorithm for finding the initial equilibrium state of the block (IES algorithm) was proposed, followed by deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based method for block lifting. The position, orientation, angular velocity of the block, and hoisting speed of the wires were applied as the DRL state. The control input of the crane was calculated by deriving the hoisting speed of the wires. To verify the proposed method, comparative studies on the application of the IES algorithm were carried out, and further block movement was compared. Conclusively, the proposed method effectively increased block lifting safety."
Consensus Building using Deep Reinforcement Learning for Energy Management,2022,"['Internet of things', 'Reinforcement learning', 'Consensus builder']",,"A variety of information is collected from IoT devices. As those devices become more familiar to users, network services must consider the influence of the user. We propose a method to maximize the value from power consumption and minimize the cost incurred to ensure user satisfaction. However, one problem is that user satisfaction cannot increase because it is considered a constraint on power consumption. In this paper, we propose a consensus building method to minimize power consumption and maximize user satisfaction. An exhaustive search incurs a large calculation overhead to determine device parameters. Thus, the proposed method uses reinforcement learning to solve this problem. From its evaluation, we clarify that the proposed method attains about 1.5 times the total reward compared with the conventional method.

However, studies on dynamic matching of routing policies with the message types of VANET are in short supply, which affects the operational efficiency and security of VANET to a certain extent. This paper studies the message types in VANET and fully considers the urgency and reliability requirements of message forwarding under various types. Based on the diversified types of messages to be transmitted, and taking the diversified message forwarding strategies suitable for VANET scenarios as behavioral candidates, an adaptive routing method for the VANET message types based on reinforcement learning (RL) is proposed. The key parameters of the method, such as state, action and reward, are reasonably designed. Simulation and analysis show that the proposed method could converge quickly, and the comprehensive performance of the proposed method is obviously better than the comparison methods in terms of timeliness and reliability."

An edge computing-based deep reinforcement learning system is demonstrated in this study that appropriately designs a multiobjective reward function for optimizing different objectives. The system seeks to overcome the challenge of evaluating actions with a simple numerical reward. The selection of reward functions has a significant impact on agents’ ability to acquire the ideal behavior for managing multiple traffic signals in a large-scale road network. To ascertain effective reward functions, the agent is trained withusing the proximal policy optimization method in several deep neural network models, including the state-of-the-art transformer network. The system is verified using both hypothetical scenarios and real-world traffic maps. The comprehensive simulation outcomes demonstrate the potency of the suggested reward functions."
Resource Allocation Strategy of Internet of Vehicles Using Reinforcement Learning,2022,"['DDQN Model', 'Internet of Vehicles', 'Markov Decision Model', 'Mobile Edge Computing', 'System Model']",,"An efficient and reasonable resource allocation strategy can greatly improve the service quality of Internet ofVehicles (IoV). However, most of the current allocation methods have overestimation problem, and it isdifficult to provide high-performance IoV network services. To solve this problem, this paper proposes anetwork resource allocation strategy based on deep learning network model DDQN. Firstly, the methodimplements the refined modeling of IoV model, including communication model, user layer computing model,edge layer offloading model, mobile model, etc., similar to the actual complex IoV application scenario. Then,the DDQN network model is used to calculate and solve the mathematical model of resource allocation. Bydecoupling the selection of target Q value action and the calculation of target Q value, the phenomenon ofoverestimation is avoided. It can provide higher-quality network services and ensure superior computing andprocessing performance in actual complex scenarios. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed methodcan maintain the network delay within 65 ms and show excellent network performance in high concurrencyand complex scenes with task data volume of 500 kbits."
Improved Meta-learning Neural Network for the Prediction of the Historical Reinforced Concrete Bond–Slip Model Using Few Test Specimens,2022,['neural network bond–slip model meta-learning architectural heritage square rebar'],,"The bond–slip model plays an important role in the structural analysis of reinforced concrete structures. However, many factors affect the bond–slip behavior, which means that a large number of tests are required to establish an accurate bond–slip model. This paper aims to establish a data-driven method for the prediction of the bond–slip model of historical reinforced concrete with few test specimens and many features. Therefore, a new Mahalanobis-Meta-learning Net algorithm was proposed, which can be used to solve the implicit regression problem in few-shot learning. Compared with the existing algorithms, the Mahalanobis-Meta-learning Net achieves fast convergence, accurate prediction and good generalization without performing a large number of tests. The algorithm was applied to the prediction task of the bond–slip model of square rebar-reinforced concrete. First, the first large pretraining database for the bond–slip model, BondSlipNet, was established containing 558 samples from the existing literature. The BondSlipNet database can be used to provide a priori knowledge for learning. Then, another database, named SRRC-Net, was obtained by 16 groups of pull-out tests with square rebar. The SRRC-Net database can be used to provide the posteriori knowledge. Finally, based on the databases, the algorithm not only successfully predicted the bond–slip model of square rebar-reinforced concrete, but also that of the other 23 types of reinforced concrete. The research results can provide a scientific basis for the conservation of square rebar-reinforced concrete structures and can contribute to the bond–slip model prediction of the other types of reinforced concrete structures."

Learning-based catheter and guidewire-driven autonomous vascular intervention robotic system for reduced repulsive force,2022,"['reinforcement learning', 'supervised learning', 'vascular intervention', 'autonomous system', 'surgical robot']",,"Manual vascular interventional radiology (VIR) procedures have been performed under radiation exposure conditions, and many commercial master–slave VIR robot systems have recently been developed to overcome this issue. However, master–slave VIR robot systems still have limitations. The operator must reside near the master device and control the slave robot using only the master device. In addition, the operator must simultaneously process the recognition of the surgical tool from the X-ray image while operating the master device. To overcome the limitations of master–slave VIR robot systems, we propose an autonomous VIR robot system with a deep learning algorithm that excludes the master device. The proposed autonomous VIR robot with a deep learning algorithm drives surgical tools to the target blood vessel location while simultaneously performing surgical tool recognition. The proposed autonomous VIR robot system detects the location of the surgical tool based on a supervised learning algorithm, and controls the surgical tools based on a reinforcement-learning algorithm. Experiments are conducted using two types of vascular phantoms to verify the effectiveness of the proposed autonomous VIR robot system. The experimental results of the vascular phantom show a comparison between the master–slave VIR robot system and the proposed autonomous VIR robot system in terms of the repulsive force, task completion time, and success rate during the operation. The proposed autonomous VIR robot system is shown to exhibit a significant reduction in repulsive force and a 96% success ratio based on a vascular phantom."
IRSML: An intelligent routing algorithm based on machine learning in software defined wireless networking,2022,"['intelligent routing', 'reinforcement learning', 'SDWN', 'supervised learning']",,"In software-defined wireless networking (SDWN), the optimal routing technique is one of the effective solutions to improve its performance. This routing technique is done by many different methods, with the most common using integer linear programming problem (ILP), building optimal routing metrics. These methods often only focus on one routing objective, such as minimizing the packet blocking probability, minimizing end-to-end delay (EED), and maximizing network throughput. It is difficult to consider multiple objectives concurrently in a routing algorithm. In this paper, we investigate the application of machine learning to control routing in the SDWN. An intelligent routing algorithm is then proposed based on the machine learning to improve the network performance. The proposed algorithm can optimize multiple routing objectives. Our idea is to combine supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL) methods to discover new routes. The SL is used to predict the performance metrics of the links, including EED quality of transmission (QoT), and packet blocking probability (PBP). The routing is done by the RL method. We use the Q-value in the fundamental equation of the RL to store the PBP, which is used for the aim of route selection. Concurrently, the learning rate coefficient is flexibly changed to determine the constraints of routing during learning. These constraints include QoT and EED. Our performance evaluations based on OMNeT++ have shown that the proposed algorithm has significantly improved the network performance in terms of the QoT, EED, packet delivery ratio, and network throughput compared with other wellknown routing algorithms."
Machine learning-based adaptive CSI feedback interval,2022,"['Channel state information feedback', 'Feedback interval', 'Adaptive feedback', 'Machine learning-based feedback']",,"The channel state information (CSI) is essential for the base station (BS) to schedule user equipments (UEs) and efficiently manage the radio resources. Hence, the BS requests UEs to regularly feed back the CSI. However, frequent CSI reporting causes large signaling overhead. To reduce the feedback overhead, we propose two machine learning-based approaches to adjust the CSI feedback interval. We use a deep neural network and reinforcement learning (RL) to decide whether an UE feeds back the CSI. Simulation results show that the RL-based approach achieves the lowest mean squared error while reducing the number of CSI feedback transmissions."
A Study on the Reinforcement of Military Practical Nursing English in the Armed Forces Nursing Academy: Focusing on TOEIC and Military Practical Nursing English Scores,2022,"['TOEIC', 'KAFNA', 'ESP', 'English Curriculum', 'Military Nursing Practical English']",,"Purpose: The Armed Forces Nursing Academy is a special-purpose university that trains nursing officers and has a unique curriculum. In Particular, regarding the English curriculum, KAFNA has TOEIC-centered general Eng-lish education and offers practical English education for military nursing. This study aimed to improve the effec-tiveness of English education at the Armed Forces Nursing Academy. The researcher identified the relationship between cadets' TOEIC scores and military nursing practical English grades, and this study, based on the rela-tionship, proposed a developmental plan for the English curriculum.Method: In this study, to confirm the relationship between general English proficiency and military nursing English skill, this study analyzed 4years of accumulated TOEIC scores and military nursing practical English grades of 298 cadets, including graduates 60th ~ 63rd year of KAFNA to find a relationship. First, the correlation between TOEIC test scores and military nursing practical English grades was examined, and a T-test was used to determine whether there were differences in military nursing English proficiency according to TOEIC test scores.Results: As a result of examining TOEIC scores and military nursing practical English grades of 298 cadets in four years, the 60th year showed a moderate correlation between the TOEIC score and the military nursing Eng-lish grade, and the 61st~63th year showed a weak correlation. Furthermore, in the case of the 60th~62th year, it was found that there was a difference in the military nursing English score according to the TOEIC score, but there was no difference in the 63rd grade.Conclusion: It seemed that TOEIC scores were only partially related to military nursing practical English grades. Therefore, to communicate in the situation of military nursing practice, which has a specialized purpose, it is necessary to increase the proportion of military nursing practice English learning. In addition, complementary methods like increasing offered credits or motivating cadets should provide so that they can take an interest in learning English for military nursing practice."
Prediction of the strength of self-compacting cementitious mix with glass fibre using machine learning,2022,"['Self-compaction concrete', 'fibre', 'glass', 'Artificial Neural Network ANN', 'MATLAB']",,"Self-compaction concrete possesses non-segregation characteristics and the ability to flow through the heavily reinforcedsection with required viscosity.

"Dual-stage, Q-learning based, Shortest-path Routing Computing Scheme: Evaluated A Case Study on Illegal-parking Surveillance Networks",2022,"['Q-learning', 'Mobile routing', 'Traveling salesman problem', 'Dijkstra algorithm', 'Illegal parking', 'Edge', 'Computing', 'Networks']",,"This paper explores a reinforcement learning (with Q-learning as the algorithm) for vehicle routing in a city-wide road network with a large customer (a generic name used for each of the locations (to denote a person possibly associated with this location) through which the vehicle needs to be routed) counts. Most reported research on vehicle routing had mainly focused on calculating the shortest route (while neglecting the shortest path between certain customer(s) and certain/all other customer(s)) between the customers. Hence, we proposed a dual-stage, Q-learning based, shortest-route generation (DQSR) in a road network, considering the shortest path between each customer and certain other customers. Notably, the first stage’s Q-learning agent develops the meta-graph of the shortest path between each customer and this customer’s nearest neighbor customers (chosen differently in number), instead of each other customer, and finds this path’s length. This development is motivated by the fact that any two adjacent customers in the shortest route are located closer than far apart, reducing the time complexity of the first stage’s Q-learning. Subsequently, the second stage’s Q-learning agent finds the shortest route from any customer to other customers from the meta-graph, connecting each other customer only once and returning to the starting customer. Hence, the DQSR generates the shortest route in a relatively shorter duration due to the small size of the state-action pairs in the meta-graph. Further, we conducted a case study on the DQSR-based, illegal-parking surveillance in Yeonsu-gu, Incheon, South Korea, to check the DQSR’s effectiveness. The case study demonstrates that the DQSR is more efficient than two other algorithms used for the same purpose in the case study, in terms of time complexity and shortest-route generation."

Online Gaussian Process State-space Model: Learning and Planning for Partially Observable Dynamical Systems,2022,"['Gaussian processes', 'Gaussian process state-space model', 'machine learning', 'reinforcement learning', 'system identification.']",,"This paper proposes an online learning method of Gaussian process state-space model (GP-SSM). GPSSM is a probabilistic representation learning scheme that represents unknown state transition and/or measurement models as Gaussian processes (GPs). While the majority of prior literature on learning of GP-SSM are focused on processing a given set of time series data, data may arrive and accumulate sequentially over time in most dynamical systems. Storing all such sequential data and updating the model over entire data incur large amount of computational resources in space and time. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a practical method, termed onlineGPSSM, that incorporates stochastic variational inference (VI) and online VI with novel formulation. The proposed method mitigates the computational complexity without catastrophic forgetting and also support adaptation to changes in a system and/or real environments. Furthermore, we present application of onlineGPSSM into the reinforcement learning (RL) of partially observable dynamical systems by integrating onlineGPSSM with Bayesian filtering and trajectory optimization algorithms. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate applicability of the proposed method."
Q-Learning을 사용한 로봇팔의 SMCSPO 게인 튜닝,2022,"['Robust Control', 'Reinforcement Learning', 'Q-Learning', 'Sliding Mode Control', 'Auto-Tuning']",,"Sliding mode control (SMC) is a robust control method to control a robot arm with nonlinear properties. A high switching gain of SMC causes chattering problems, although the SMC allows the adequate control performance by giving high switching gain, without the exact robot model containing nonlinear and uncertainty terms. In order to solve this problem, SMC with sliding perturbation observer (SMCSPO) has been researched, where the method can reduce the chattering by compensating the perturbation, which is estimated by the observer, and then choosing a lower switching control gain of SMC. However, optimal gain tuning is necessary to get a better tracking performance and reducing a chattering. This paper proposes a method that the Q-learning automatically tunes the control gains of SMCSPO with an iterative operation. In this tuning method, the rewards of reinforcement learning (RL) are set minus tracking errors of states, and the action of RL is a change of control gain to maximize rewards whenever the iteration number of movements increases. The simple motion test for a 7-DOF robot arm was simulated in MATLAB program to prove this RL tuning algorithm. The simulation showed that this method can automatically tune the control gains for SMCSPO."

Across measurements from out-of-process variables, including hole diameter, roundness, surface roughness, entry/exit delamination, and entry/exit uncut fiber area, in-process measurements were most able to find outliers with respect to diameter. Both Principal Component Analysis, an unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique, and Linear Discriminant Analysis, a supervised dimensionality reduction technique, could separate oversize or undersize holes from average-sized holes when using fast Fourier transformation data of in-process vibration. Predictive performance with k-Nearest Neighbors shows that our machine learning pipeline can predict oversized vs. non-oversized holes with over 85% accuracy in this dataset. Peak prediction performance is obtained when in-process measurement data is viewed from the frequency domain, and predictions are weighted based on the relative distances of the nearest neighbors."

This study evaluates the efficiency of three ensemble deep neural network models, including the model averaging ensemble, weighted average ensemble, and integrated stacking ensemble for predicting the failure mode of the RCSWs. The ensemble deep neural network models are compared against previous studies that used traditional well-known ensemble models (AdaBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) and traditional machine learning methods (Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest). The weighted average ensemble model is proposed as the best-suited prediction model for identifying the failure mode since it has the highest accuracy, precision, and recall among the alternative models.

This research has used the computational methods of machine learning to achieve a new evaluation of the shear strength of reinforced concrete (RC) beams. In the first step, 85 laboratory samples were examined. These samples had different geometric and non-geometric properties. The effect of each parameter was examined for smart models, then the optimal state of the parameters was determined. By optimizing the number of parameters, basic models were developed. The different structures of these models were investigated for the accurate evaluation of the shear strength of the samples. Finally, in the second step, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA) were used to perpetuate and optimize the weights of the base models. The hybrid models were developed and applied with different structures for evaluation of shear strength and the best models were selected from them. The results showed that both models offer better performance than the base model. However, the GA-based model achieved higher accuracy and less error than the PSO-based model. Finally, the performance of these models was used for new data to evaluate their performance.

Interactive reinforcement learning strategies suggest that robots learn task by receiving feedback from an experienced human trainer during a training process. However, most of the previous studies on Interactive reinforcement learning have required an extra feedback input device such as a mouse or keyboard in addition to robot itself, and the scenario where a robot can interactively learn a task with human have been also limited to virtual environment. To solve these limitations, this paper studies training strategies of robot that learn table balancing tasks interactively using deep reinforcement learning with human’s facial expression feedback. In the proposed system, the robot learns a cooperative table balancing task using Deep Q-Network (DQN), which is a deep reinforcement learning technique, with human facial emotion expression feedback. As a result of the experiment, the proposed system achieved a high optimal policy convergence rate of up to 83.3% in training and successful assumption rate of up to 91.6% in testing, showing improved performance compared to the model without human facial expression feedback."

This paper presents a system architecture that replaces the existing procedural segment selection algorithm with a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C). The distributed A3C-based deep learning server is designed and implemented to allow multiple clients in different network conditions to stream videos simultaneously, collect learning data quickly, and learn asynchronously, resulting in greatly improved learning speed as the number of video clients increases.

동적시스템 제어를 위한 효율적인 강화학습 방법,2022,"['Model based learning', 'PILCO', 'Gaussian process', 'External Control', 'Rotary inverted pendulum']",,"Reinforcement learning is a method in which the controller interacts with the target system to collect data and utilizes it to evaluate and update itself. The common disadvantages of reinforcement learning are that it takes a considerable amount of time from initial random controls to valid controls, and that it can fall into local optima. For this reason, a method for improving learning efficiency by applying verified external control is being studied. In this paper, external control is utilized for data collection, making it easier to access data that is helpful for learning. This method not only improved learning efficiency, but also was able to derive a more stable controller than the external control by learning. To prove this, we applied the proposed method to RIP(Rotary Inverted Pendulum), which is used for controller stability experiments, and as external controls, swing-up and balance controls, which are commonly used for RIP control, were utilized."

The RL model used the double deep Q-network (DDQN) with the prioritized experience replay (PER). Since the agents are unable to identify end-to-end latencies in the multi-agent environment, the state and reward were obtained using the estimated end-to-end latencies. Four network topologies were implemented and simulated to compare the reinforcement learning-based scheduler, FIFO, round robin (RR), and a simple heuristic algorithm (HA). As a result of simulation in fixed packet generation scenarios, the RL-based scheduler achieved the minimization of maximum end-to-end latency in all the topologies. The FIFO and RR schedulers could not minimize the maximum end-to-end latency in any of the topology, and the HA could not minimize the maximum end-to-end latency in a single topology. In scenarios with random flows generation, the RL-based scheduler performed better than the FIFO and RR, but performed the same as or worse than the HA, depending on the topology."

Especially, it is difficult to overcome the assembly error, and the assembly takes a long time due to the error correction process, which makes it difficult to automate the assembly task. To deal with this problem, a reinforcement learning-based assembly strategy using contact states was proposed to quickly perform the assembly process in an unstructured environment. This method learns to generate a search trajectory to quickly find a hole based on the contact state obtained from the force/torque data. It can also learn the stiffness needed to avoid excessive contact forces during assembly. To verify this proposed method, power connector assembly process was performed 200 times, and it was shown to have an assembly success rate of 100% in a translation error within ±4 mm and a rotation error within ±3.5°.

Recently Republic of Korea kicked off the development of anti-artillery interception system similar to Israel’s “Iron Dome”, designed to protect against North Korea’s arsenal of long-range rockets. The system may not work smoothly without the function assigning interceptors to incoming various-caliber artillery rockets. We view the assignment task as a dynamic weapon target assignment (DWTA) problem. DWTA is a multistage decision process in which decision in a stage affects decision processes and its results in the subsequent stages. We represent the DWTA problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). Distance from Seoul to North Korea’s multiple rocket launchers positioned near the border, limits the processing time of the model solver within only a few second. It is impossible to compute the exact optimal solution within the allowed time interval due to the curse of dimensionality inherently in MDP model of practical DWTA problem. We apply two reinforcement-based algorithms to get the approximate solution of the MDP model within the time limit. To check the quality of the approximate solution, we adopt Shoot-Shoot-Look(SSL) policy as a baseline. Simulation results showed that both algorithms provide better solution than the solution from the baseline strategy."

Currently, the warehouse determines the loading location based on the order of the requirement of products, that is, the frequency of arrival and departure. Items with lower requirement ranks are loaded away from the exit, and items with higher requirement ranks are loaded closer from the exit. This is a case in which the delivery time is faster than the products located near the exit, even if the products are loaded far from the exit due to the low requirement ranking. In this case, there is a problem in that the transit time increases when the product is released. In order to solve the problem, we use the idle time of the stocker in the warehouse to rearrange the products according to the order of delivery time. Temporal difference learning method using Q_learning control, which is one of reinforcement learning types, was used when relocating items. The results of rearranging the products using the reinforcement learning method were compared and analyzed with the results of the existing method."

As new services arise from the intersection of information technology and vehicle technology, vehicular ad hoc networks are increasingly established and utilized. Therefore, the development of transmission techniques that can realize low latency in vehicle ad hoc networks can become the basis of such vehicle network communication and thus requirements for various vehicular services can be satisfied. In this research, we introduce a transmission scheme for a highly mobility vehicular ad hoc network. Based on the REINFORCE algorithm, one of the frameworks of deep reinforcement learning, the proposed scheme can forecast the current channel state and its transition, as well as develop a policy for performing the optimal action. It was discovered that the proposed method converges to the optimal policy through extensive simulations and iterative execution. It was shown that the proposed algorithm achieves a low latency with a high transmission rate based on the Slotted ALOHA protocol compared to the existing transmission method used for comparison."

Process control has been implemented by utilizing traditional techniques such as PID (Proportional-Integrate-Derivative) control andMPC (Model Predictive Control). However, these approaches have disadvantages when the PID tuning rules do not provide optimal tuning parameters for various operating scenarios or when the model fails to match the actual plant. RL (Reinforcement Learning) is one of the most prominent data-driven techniques for addressing such issues and has gained popularity in recent years. While RL has been extensively studied and succeeds in controlling chemical processes, the reward function has a significant impact on its performance. Therefore, it is essential to specify the reward function in order to efficiently control the process. In this study, we propose a reward function to enhance the performance of RL and compare the control performances of MPC and RLs with four distinct reward functions. The controllers track the setpoint of the product in the Van de Vusse process and are evaluated based on the deviation between the setpoint and output. RL with the proposed reward function outperformed the other controllers. Its performance was 12% greater than that of MPC and 6-30% greater than other RL controllers. In chemical processes, the control performance of RL is enhanced byincorporating the time term and positive reward in the reward function, thus outperforming conventional control approaches."

This thesis focused on how the flipped-learning-based writing class could be realized in a new, non-face-to-face online environment, paying attention to the positive effects of flipped learning.In particular, this study intends to confirm the usefulness of flipped learning in a non-face-toface situation triggered by a pandemic. The purpose of this study was to determine whether flipped learning is a means to promote participation and dialogue in learners who have difficulties in interaction. As a result, it was confirmed that flipped learning can contribute to some extent in enhancing and reinforcing learners’ sense of presence and interaction in proportion to the learner’s activity.Of course, flipped-learning cannot be idealized as the sole criterion for a writing class. This is because a writing classroom based on flipped-learning presupposes the activeness of learners who have acquired a certain knowledge of writing. And such active dialogue and participation are necessary parts even in the offline classroom. In the end, the instructor is inevitably faced with the problem of how to elicit the ‘learner’s activity’. This is a task that learners and instructors must solve together as members of the learning community. More diverse methods to create an organic interaction model of online and offline classes should be continuously tested."

To this end, informal learning at work plays an important role for small and medium-sized enterprises that are having difficulties in human resource development. If the GRIT of workers and the spiritual leadership of leaders are maintained at an appropriate level, the effect of informal learning will increase. This study derived the following results through a survey of workers participating in the Work-learning Dual System in Korea. First, experience and feedback among informal learning activities have a significant positive effect on competency development. Second, the higher the level of the GRIT of workers, the greater the magnitude of the positive effect of experience and feedback on competency development, showing a positive moderating effect. Third, in the case of workers with high GRIT, capacity development is strengthened as experience or feedback increases, and the higher the level of spiritual leadership, the greater the scope of reinforcement. On the other hand, it can be seen that in the case of workers with low GRIT, competency development weakens as experience or feedback increases, and the higher the level of spiritual leadership, the greater the extent of the weakening."

For analysis, the use and search were subdivided into refinement, deepening, reinforcement, and attempts in innovation, opening up to external organizations and experts, and pursuit of creative alternatives, respectively, to confirm whether each variable actually affects the performance of public officials. As a result of the analysis, both the central and local governments improved the performance of their organizational members as they deepened their existing expertise. In the short term, it shows that the active use and deepening of the existing knowledge of the organization is important. On the other hand, it was important for the central government to try in a completely new way of work in exploratory learning. However, it has been confirmed that opening up local governments to innovative external organizations and experts is important in improving the organization’s performance. Based on the analysis results, three policy implications were derived. First, a strategic approach of organizational learning is needed to improve short-term performance and create long-term performance. Second, differential performance management measures between the central and local governments should be presented. Third, it is necessary to minimize the influence of specific members in the organization and improve the organizational culture."

In this paper, we propose a low-power buffer management algorithm that takes into account the information transmission delay in an IoT network. By forwarding or skipping received packets utilizing deep Q learning employed in deep reinforcement learning methods, the suggested method is able to reduce power consumption while decreasing transmission delay level. The proposed approach is demonstrated to reduce power consumption and to improve delay relative to the existing buffer management technique used as a comparison in slotted ALOHA protocol."

Methods To achieve the research objective, the project contents, student reflections of the experiences, and class evaluation questionnaires for the <Sharing Service-Learning> subject, held over three semesters from the first semester of 2020 to the first semester of 2021, were analyzed. Results The analysis of the learning experience revealed several findings. First, in terms of service, opportunities for facing a new realm of reality increased due to the diversity of services provided, but there was a lack of experience with interaction from face-to-face contacts. Second, in terms of learning, educational effects were similar to previous studies, but no growth in human relations nor empathy toward socially vulnerable people were evident. Third, the instructor s role as facilitator was acknowledged as important, and the limitations of the use of school facilities and technologies caused by COVID-19 hindered the realization of ideas, which meant that engineering design-oriented service-learning was not fully realized to its full potential. Conclusions In future non-face-to-face or online service-learning practices, the following can be considered: (1) Supplementing interactions through reinforcing face-to-face activities using real-time video systems or establishing a feedback system even when contact-free service is provided. (2) Promoting team project activities that can stimulate and enable reflection on human relationships. (3) Designing classes that resonate with the socially disadvantaged. (4) Developing facilitator minds in instructors. (5) Operating maker spaces that are intensively focused on projects suitable for non-face-to-face scenarios (especially when engineering design-oriented)."

Each letter in the Korean language having an etymological meaning is a characteristic of the Korean language that explains why it contains many Chinese characters. Such a fact needs to be treated as the topic of the Korean language education, and not that of the Chinese character education as previously done. This change of perception is equal to moving away from the past perception of Chinese character cultural sphere and newly establishing a modern educational perspective. Based on such discussion, an educational proposal to include learning of Korean language morphemes based on the Chinese character etymology in vocabulary education is proposed."

This paper proposes a deep learning model comprising attention and convolutional recurrent neural networks that can select and extract the time-series pattern of dynamic connectivity between the two regions within the brain based on observations. By integration of the extracted autism disorder features from dynamic connectivity through attention with the structure containing interlayer connections to preserve the functional connectivity loss within a neural network, the model extracts the connectivity between the STS and visual cortex, leading to an increase in generalization performance. A 10-fold cross-validation to compare the performance shows that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models by achieving an improvement of 4.90% in the ASD classification.

This paper’s biggest arguments are as follow: First, experiential learning has been solely interested in contact, personal, and aspects of contextual experiences for cognitive learning, while meta-learning has special attention on non-contact, indirect, beyond-context, and a mediated learning. Second, since meta-learning is especially useful for intuitive and technology-based learning situations, it helps much the learning practices of technology-friendly learners. Third, the meta-learning principles (models) may include meta-reinforcement learning, distributed learning, federated learning, and self-adaptive learning.

To avoid complexity, previous studies have applied a number of constraints on the high-dimensional state-action space, thus hindering generalized policy function learning. In this study, the control problem is addressed by in-troducing a hierarchical reinforcement learning method that can learn the end-to-end control policy of a multi-DOF manipula-tor without any constraints on the state-action space. The proposed method learns hierarchical policy using two off-policy methods. Using human demonstration data and a newly proposed data-correction method, controlling the multi-DOF manipu-lator in an end-to-end manner is shown to outperform the non-hierarchical deep reinforcement learning methods."

Traditional robots have been used to perform repetitive tasks in a fixed environment, and it is very difficult to solve a problem in which the physical interaction of the surrounding environment or other objects is complicated with the existing control method. Reinforcement learning has been actively studied as a method of machine learning to solve such problems, and provides answers to problems that robots have not solved in the conventional way. Studies on the learning of all physical robots are commonly affected by noise. Complex noises, such as control errors of robots, limitations in performance of measurement equipment, and complexity of physical interactions with surrounding environments and objects, can act as factors that degrade learning. A learning method that works well in a virtual environment may not very effective in a real robot. Therefore, this paper proposes a weighted sum method and a linear regression method as an effective and accurate learning method in a noisy environment. In addition, the bottle flipping was trained on a robot and compared with the existing learning method, the validity of the proposed method was verified."

However, it is difficult to design the reward function if the ample information of the objects cannot be obtained. In this study, a demonstration-based object manipulation algorithm called stochastic exploration guided by demonstration (SEGD) is proposed to solve the design problem of the reward function. SEGD is a reinforcement learning algorithm in which a sparse reward explorer (SRE) and an interpolated policy using demonstration (IPD) are added to soft actor-critic (SAC). SRE ensures the training of the critic of SAC by collecting prior data and IPD limits the exploration space by making SEGD’s action similar to the expert’s action. Through these two algorithms, the SEGD can learn only with the sparse reward of the task without designing the reward function. In order to verify the SEGD, experiments were conducted for three tasks. SEGD showed its effectiveness by showing success rates of more than 96.5% in these experiments."

The effective transformer from observation of the agent to visual representation determines the navigation actions and promotes more informed navigation policy. In this work, we propose a spatial sequential transformer network (SSTNet) for learning informative visual representation in deep reinforcement learning. SSTNet is composed by spatial attention probability fused model (SAF) and sequential transformer network (STNet). SAF enforces cross-modal state into visual clues in reinforcement learning. It encodes semantic information about observed objects, as well as spatial information about their location, which jointly exploiting image inter-relations. STNet generates (imagines) the next observations and makes action inference of the aspects most relevant to the target. It decodes the image intra-relations. This way, the agent learns to understand the causality between navigation actions and dynamic changes in observations. SSTNet is conditioned on an auto-regressive model on the desired reward, past states, actions, and knowledge graph. The whole navigation framework considers the local and global visual information, as well as time sequential information. Thus, it allows the agent to navigate towards the sought-after object effectively. We evaluate our model on the AI2THOR framework show that our method attains at least $10\%$ improvement of average success rate over most state-of-the-art models.

Improvement of Colon Polyp Detection Performance by Modifying the Multi-scale Network Structure and Data Augmentation,2022,"['Colonoscopy', 'Computer-aided diagnosis systems', 'Data augmentation', 'Multi-scale networks', 'Network layer']",,"This study proposed a computer-assisted diagnosis system that detects polyps during colonoscopy using a multiscale network structure. Medical data require institutional review board approval, and collecting suffi cient data is challenging for several reasons. The amount of data may be small thereby resulting in overfi tting. This study attempted to increase the amount of data available to solve this problem. Autoaugment and the policy applied to the CIFAR-10 dataset were used. This data augmentation can be learned immediately without review by a colonist because no changes in the shape of the polyp occur during colonoscopy with minimal movement in location. The object detection network used was YOLOv4, which is capable of multiscale learning. Multiscale learning is advantageous in detecting an object regardless of the size of the lesion because it can extract features of various sizes through one learning. In this study, the learning advantages of multiple scales were reinforced via the addition of scales to YOLOv4, while the learning accuracy was improved by changing the activation function. Therefore, the changed activation function can continuously extract features when updating the layer weight. When using all the methods presented, mAP exhibited the highest performance at 98.36."

Questionnaires about the contact situations bringing about friction and conflict factors,  were administered to six employees working in Japanese companies in Korea, by using 51 friction items and reproducing 7 cases of discourses. The ‘sociolculture proficiency’ and the ‘linguistic proficiency’ occurred more frequently than the ‘sociolinguistic proficiency’, for the interaction language proficiency in the business without smooth communication. The ‘sociolculture proficiency’ was reconstructed into discourses, to show that the types of friction cases were divided into three cases in which failure occurred because 1) there is a lack of common sense; 2) differences between both countries were not understood, though there were some similarities between them; 3) the other country's culture was not well-acquainted, as each custom of Korea and Japan is quite different. The friction cases occurred less frequently in using words such as verbs or nouns containing the meanings of respect or humility. Several grammar forms such as the expressions of respect and humility were often misused and were those in which humility was added to causative forms like ‘～saseteitadaku’, which are more used than any other expressions. PBL(Prolem- Based-Learning) has recently attracted attention in Korea. PBL is a self-initiated learning method in which professors encourage learners to spontaneously find out solution to problems, by presenting problematic situations to the learner, before beginning the learning."

Here, we review how VTA cell populations wire to the other brain regions and how these projections differentially contribute to motivated behavior through the distinct molecular mechanism. We summarize the activities, projections and functions of VTA neurons concerning motivated behavior. This review article discriminates VTA cell populations related to the motivated behavior based on the neurotransmitters they release and extends the classical view of the dopamine-mediated reward system."

This center would strengthen the publicity of the National University Hospital and contribute to the public health system reinforcement. Throughout investigating case studies such as the START Simulation Center at the Catholic University, the Simulation Center at Asan Medical Center, and the MESH at Hanyang University, one of the key architectural attributes was that simulation rooms were guided and managed by their own control rooms. Through one-way mirrors, and debriefing rooms, students had a chance to review clinical processes and medical treatments in adjacently placed simulation rooms. In addition, the floor plans were generally composed of a double aisle, which made the overall circulation more effective. Based on these architectural attributes, the architectural design project presented a newly defined simulation-based clinical education training center. This clinical education training center aims to enhance clinical performances and problem-solving processes of medical and nursing students through medical simulators and provide an opportunity for local health professionals to educate them on how to use advanced medical equipment."

The book was widely distributed in both China and Korea, and often mentioned in history of the early Protestant churches in both countries. Although study has been conducted on this work, comparative analysis of its diverse editions, which is prerequisite for bibliographic research, has not yet done properly. Thus this study focused on bibliographical analysis of various editions available.Since the first edition was published in 1879, the book has been continuously reprinted up to the 1920s and there is a huge difference in content between the first and later editions. For example. the first edition originally consisted of 17 chapters, but in the 1882 edition, one chapter was added to make it 18 chapters, with detailed explanation on the workings of the universe. In the 1887 edition, the term for the Christian God was changed to Zhenshen (眞神) and Ling (靈) and the chapter detailing the Bible was greatly reinforced. Since then, many editions were produced and distributed. The contents of later editions are the same as those of the 1887 edition, but the terms for God varied ranging from Shangdi, Shen, Zhenshen, to Tianzhu, reflecting the book’s wide usage by diverse denominations. This research can help researchers who study the Gate of Virtue and Wisdom select a proper edition in their study of Griffith John's thoughts and his works. Furthermore, it will serve as a useful reference for studying the Korean translation of this work."

The Korean peninsula is also not free from the order of war. Aggression is sometimes confused with active act, and the expression of aggression is accepted as the self-realization of the subject.However, aggression stems from fear and is nothing more than a passive act reinforced by environmental and social learning. To be obsessed with aggression is to be incorporated into the order of war. Rather, the active practice of the subject can be found in the lessons of Jesus. Jesus preached give oneself to others and practiced himself in active obedience.Cases of overcoming the war-torn situation through active solidarity and cooperation with neighbors can be found in the Canaan Farmers School. This School, which began with the farmers’ “living well” movement, had a great influence on the reconstruction process of Korean society after the war.Now, Korean society needs active efforts to newly “live well” through solidarity and cooperation with neighbors again."

Social distancing resulted in increased family time, which caused mothers to experience an overload of caregiving and housework while allowing fathers to bond with their children. Stay-at-home mothers who had school-aged children experienced the most extreme degree of depression and exhaustion among all mothers because they were disproportionately responsible for their children’s day-to-day needs and at-home learning. Mothers with adult children, on the other hand, did not sense any particular burden in their experiences as parents, similar to most fathers. Instead, they relished the opportunity to reflect on and rediscover parenthood while spending “quality time” at home with their children. Although there was more family time, mothers continued to do the majority of the housework and caregiving, and neither fathers nor mothers attempted to resist to bargain or contest this. It caused “corona blue” (or “COVID depression”) to be solely shared by women as opposed to men, particularly among stay-at-home mothers with school-aged children. These findings support my claim that, in addition to reinforcing the gender division of labor, global crises like COVID-19 also exacerbate gender inequalities in parental role satisfaction and overall mental health."

Jeongjo’s Tangpyeong Policy was intended to reestablish the power relationship between the regality and bureaucracy. He executed Tangpyeong politics to overcome conflicts and detrimental consequences of factional fighting and enforce his political ideal, ‘the politics of three generations.’ Jeongjo’s Tangpyeong Policy was focused on royal ruling theory not on the existing sage learning. He carried out Tangpyeong politics to form public opinions and control factions as he thought the role of supporting factions had corrupted. He wanted to accomplish unitied politics through the Tangpyeong method by rejecting divided politics and completely integrating all subjects around the king. The Tangpyeong Policy in the reign of King Jeongjo was a practical method and aimed ideology to incarnate the sage king politics. Jeongjo’s ‘the sage king ruling’ was intended to exert every effort for the purpos of achieving harmonious and cooperative politics by coorindating conflicting political powers and judging disputes. For this end, the king exercised balanced and integrated leadership by opening the offices to the talented and compromising factional strife. His political leadership was vividly realized in the process of driving diverse reformative policies of Tangpyeong politics. King Jeongjo properly exerted his rulership in Tangpyeong politics for the diagnosis and prescription of the time and in the course of securing support. He diagnosed his reigning period as ‘a vortex of grave illnesses’, suggested ‘a reform’ as a prescription for them and executed Tangpyeong to solve factional strife. For him, Tangpyeong means the politics of a sage sovereign to be realized in all politico-social fields. As a conclusion, King Jeongjo’s Tangpyeong politics can be summed up as the exertion of the leadership to accomplish political ideals of reforming people’s livelihood matters by reinforcing the regal power."
Path-Based Computation Encoder for Neural Architecture Search,2022,"['Neural Architecture Search', 'Path-based Computation', 'Performance Predictor']",,"Recently, neural architecture search (NAS) has received increasing attention as it can replace human experts indesigning the architecture of neural networks for different tasks and has achieved remarkable results in manychallenging tasks. In this study, a path-based computation neural architecture encoder (PCE) was proposed.Our PCE first encodes the computation of information on each path in a neural network, and then aggregatesthe encodings on all paths together through an attention mechanism, simulating the process of informationcomputation along paths in a neural network and encoding the computation on the neural network instead ofthe structure of the graph, which is more consistent with the computational properties of neural networks. Weperformed an extensive comparison with eight encoding methods on two commonly used NAS search spaces(NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201), which included a comparison of the predictive capabilities of performancepredictors and search capabilities based on two search strategies (reinforcement learning-based andBayesian optimization-based) when equipped with different encoders. Experimental evaluation shows that PCEis an efficient encoding method that effectively ranks and predicts neural architecture performance, therebyimproving the search efficiency of neural architectures."

First of all, during the Ming Dynasty era of China, Simhak was prospering and the academic regulations of Ryonggang Seowon and Daegwa Seowon were established by the Simhak scholars. In early part of the 17th century, a new academic regulation of Donglim Seowon that criticized the decadence end of Samhak and emphasized the enlightening of learnings was newly established. On the other hand, the nationalized Seowons with the focusing on advancing the government officer reserve class was popular and this could be affirmed in the case of Gonghak Seowon that established the academic regulation in a similar period with Donglim Seowon. In Joseon, Ju Se-bung established the first Seowon, Baekwundong Seowon [Sosu Seowon], in 1543 and established its academic regulation, and the academic regulation at this time had taken the nationalized Seowon in the Ming Dynasty as its model. However, with the noble scholar culture being matured thereafter, Yi Hwang and others walked the path of nationalized schooling, and unlike the general Seowons in Ming Dynasty where the educational contents were more concrete, the academic regulation for the study of Confucius classics and led by the noble scholars with the exclusion of past study patterns and interruption of government authority was established. The scholars of early Qing Dynasty pointed out the ill-effected Simhak at the end of the Ming Dynasty and placed effort to re-establish the enlightening of learnings. This type of phenomenon could be found through the academic regulations of Gwanjung Seowon and Hwango Seowon established by the scholars du ring the reign of Gang Hee. Under the reinforcement of the central power system during the reigns of Ongjeong and Geonryung, the nationalized Seowon system was even more well-established.In particular, with the administrative impact and edification influencing in the regional sectors, Cheonghae had the academic regulation of Samcheon Seowon established. After the mid-19 century, there were Seowons that blended new western learnings, and like Jungseo Seowon, such a trend was reflected in the academic regulation. On the other hand, the Seowons in the later Joseon had its importance as an organization for locale and memorial services rather than educational purposes. The local controlling forces attempted to sustain the traditional values with the Seowons leading the social and economic changes. From the late 17th century to the decree to abolish the Seowons, a number of academic regulations were newly established under the well-known sages of the Tang Dynasty, but the contents had strong retro characteristics. Rather, some of the well-established Seowons strengthened the restrictive social status for the admission qualification, and in the process, serious conflicts occurred surrounding the interpretation of such academic regulation."

As for the research tool, Lee's 32-question teaching competency diagnosis tool was used. The characteristics of the subjects were analyzed by descriptive statistics. The gap between the importance and performance of the teaching competency recognized by the subject was analyzed as a paired t-test. The IPA (importance-practice analysis) Matrix analysis was performed to analyze the results of the difference between each variable. The areas that need to be maintained and strengthened were the 'basic comptence'. The 'teaching competence' appeared to be an area where further efforts were not needed and needs to be improved in the future. In addition, in the case of lecture management, teaching-learning design, and interaction, the importance was high, but the implementation was low, so it seemed that improvement efforts needed to be concentrated. Reflecting these results, it is necessary to establish an educational strategy faithful to basic competencies when preparing educational improvement measures to strengthen teaching competency. It is necessary to establish a strategy to modify the area of intensive improvement and a strategy to strengthen the area of maintenance and reinforcement."

Items that need to be corrected or supplemented in diphthong education for Uzbek learners were selected as /ㅢ, ㅛ, wi, wE/. The pronunciation error rate of the /ㅢ/ was 96.3% when there was no preceding consonant at the beginning, which was significantly higher than the error rate of /ㅢ/ in other conditions. This was a result of the fact that the pronunciation form of /ㅢ/ was different according to the influence of the mother tongue and phonological conditions. It was suggested to correct the error by repeating the learning of the short vowel /ㅡ/ in the diphthong learning. The pronunciation error of /ㅛ/ was 40.7%, and it was found that the pronunciation error rate of men was higher than that of women. This was confirmed by the influence of the vowel /ㅗ/, and in the case of male Uzbek learners, the vowel space of /ㅗ/ overlapped with /ㅓ/ a lot, thus affecting /ㅛ/ pronunciation. Therefore, it was suggested that the pronunciation education of /ㅛ/ should also be modified through education on the short vowel /ㅗ/.

Weight Adjustment Scheme Based on Hop Count in Q-routing for Software Defined Networks-enabled Wireless Sensor Networks,2022,"['Reinforcement learning', 'Wireless sensor networks', 'Software defined networks', 'Q-routing']",,"The reinforcement learning algorithm has proven its potential in solving sequential decision-making problems under uncertainties, such as finding paths to route data packets in wireless sensor networks. With reinforcement learning, the computation of the optimum path requires careful definition of the so-called reward function, which is defined as a linear function that aggregates multiple objective functions into a single objective to compute a numerical value (reward) to be maximized. In a typical defined linear reward function, the multiple objectives to be optimized are integrated in the form of a weighted sum with fixed weighting factors for all learning agents. This study proposes a reinforcement learning -based routing protocol for wireless sensor network, where different learning agents prioritize different objective goals by assigning weighting factors to the aggregated objectives of the reward function. We assign appropriate weighting factors to the objectives in the reward function of a sensor node according to its hop-count distance to the sink node. We expect this approach to enhance the effectiveness of multi-objective reinforcement learning for wireless sensor networks with a balanced trade-off among competing parameters. Furthermore, we propose SDN (Software Defined Networks) architecture with multiple controllers for constant network monitoring to allow learning agents to adapt according to the dynamics of the network conditions. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme enhances the performance of wireless sensor network under varied conditions, such as the node density and traffic intensity, with a good trade-off among competing performance metrics."

Quays in shipyards have different lengths, depths, and facilities so that the allowable quays for each ship are limited. In addition, the working efficiency of the quay process depends on the kinds of the quays where the outfitting processes are performed. As a result, it is inevitable for ships to move around the quays to avoid delay in schedule while maximizing the working efficiency. The movements of ships should be minimized because it is a waste of cost and time. In most shipyards, the quay allocation is manually determined by planners using their own implicit rules. However, the optimal plan can’t be obtained by those heuristics which only considers limited problem space. In this study, the scheduling algorithm for the quay allocation problem is developed using a reinforcement learning approach. Based on the Markov decision process model using discrete-event simulation, the scheduling agent is trained by DRQN (Deep Recurrent Q-network) algorithm and tested with 10 scenarios. The proposed algorithm outperforms the reference value set by heuristic in terms of three KPIs-unallocated duration, the number of ship movements, and ship-quay priority ratio."

Failure of reinforcement due to corrosion has detrimental impacts on nearly all of these structures. Hence, proposing an accurate and reliable model was imperative. The goal of this paper is to develop a new hybrid model by combining Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with Dragonfly Algorithm (DA) for Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) to predict the corrosion current density (C11) of marine reinforced concrete. The neuro-fuzzy-based methods have emerged as suitable techniques for encountering uncertainties associated with the corrosion phenomenon in marine structures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research that predicts the C11 through a model integrating fuzzy learning, neural learning rules, and meta-heuristics. 2460 data are collected from 37 regions in Persian Gulf. The input parameters are age, concrete repairing history, height above the sea level, distance from sea, concrete compressive strength, rebar diameter, concrete cover depth, concrete electrical resistivity, chloride ion concentration and pH. The proposed rules for the estimation of C11 based on collected dataset are assessed based on the several metrics such as R2, efficiency, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and median of absolute error (MEDAE). According to the results, ANFIS-PSO–DA enables to predict C11 by R2 (0.92), MAPE (1.67), MEDAE (0.14), and EF (0.97).

Usually the system model is used to get the initial controller, but eventually the controller parameters must be manually adjusted in the real system to achieve the best performance. To avoid this manual tuning step, data-driven methods such as machine learning were used. Recently, reinforcement learning became one alternative of this problem to be considered as an agent learns policies in large state space with trial-and-error Markov Decision Process (MDP) which is widely used in the field of robotics. However, on initial training step, as an agent tries to explore to the new state space with random action and acts directly on the controller parameters in real systems, MDP can lead the system safety-critical system failures. Therefore, the issue of ‘safe exploration’ became important. In this paper we meet ‘safe exploration’ condition with Control Barrier Function (CBF) which converts direct constraints on the state space to the implicit constraint of the control inputs. Given an initial low-performance controller, it automatically optimizes the parameters of the control law while ensuring safety by the CBF so that the agent can learn how to predict and control unknown and often stochastic environments. Simulation results on a quadrotor UAV indicate that the proposed method can safely optimize controller parameters quickly and automatically."

Minimize makespan of permutation flowshop using pointer network,2022,"['optimization', 'permutation flowshop', 'pointer network', 'reinforcement learning', 'sequencing']",,"During the shipbuilding process, a block assembly line suffers a bottleneck when the largest amount of material is processed. Therefore, scheduling optimization is important for the productivity. Currently, sequence of inbound products is controlled by determining the input sequence using a heuristic or metaheuristic approach. However, the metaheuristic algorithm has limitations in that the computation time increases exponentially as the number of input objects increases, and separate optimization calculations are required for every problem. Also, the heuristic such as dispatching algorithm has the limitation of the exploring the problem domain. Therefore, this study tries a reinforcement learning algorithm based on a pointer network to overcome these limitations. Reinforcement learning with pointer network is found to be suitable for permutation flowshop problem, including input-order optimization. A trained neural network is applied without re-learning, even if the number of inputs is changed. The trained model shows the meaningful results compared with the heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms in makespan and computation time. The trained model outperforms the heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms within a limited range of permutation flowshop problem."

For this purpose, attention was paid to analysis of the texts in the responses to the subject lecture evaluations in the subjects for teaching profession. Specifically, top 100 texts were drawn according to the frequency of words in a total of 1,187(1,120) texts through text mining analysis among the analyses of the texts in the responses to the subjective lecture evaluations for Educational Sociology, which is the subject for teaching profession in the first term of 2022 in D, H, J, and K Universities to review the general trend in operating the subjects for teaching profession. The main texts drawn included 'participatory class,' 'question,' 'Socrates,' 'subject for teaching profession,' 'this term,' 'other,' 'most,' 'instructor-centered,' and 'theory-based.' This result indicates what has been controversial in teacher training institutions and confirms the need of a new approach to teaching-learning. The results of the text mining analysis were reflected in sentiment analysis. The sentiment analysis found the trend of 'positive' sentiment in most of the 40 paragraphs. 'Strongly positive' sentiment was found in 15 paragraphs, and 'negative' sentiment in 13 paragraphs. It was hard to find the trend of 'neutral' and 'strongly negative' sentiment. While emphasis was placed on reinforcement of learners' competency in 'strongly positive' sentiment, focus was placed on learners' own reflection rather than on instruction or instructor assessment in 'negative' sentiment. On the basis of the results from the text mining and sentiment analyses, policy-based plans for reinforcing teaching competency in subject can be suggested as follows: What is to be changed most urgently is instructors' awareness. Using the strengths of professors that only each university can present as a specialized strategy, it proposes a plan to set up a ""teacher talent award."" This study is most significant in that qualitative data were used to analyze texts with the objective of developing a plan for reinforcing teaching competency in subject."

Adaptive Fault-tolerant Control for Trajectory Tracking and Rectification of Directional Drilling,2022,"['Fault-tolerant control (FTC)', 'integral sliding mode control (ISMC)', 'neural network (NN)', 'nonlinear control system', 'reinforcement learning (RL).']",,"Motivated by the increasing demands on complex borehole trajectories in oil and gas directional drilling, an adaptive fault-tolerant control (AFTC) method for drilling trajectory tracking and rectification of rotary steerable system (RSS) is proposed by adopting actor-critic reinforcement learning (RL) and integral sliding mode control (ISMC) in the presence of system uncertainties and fault signals. Considering a discrete delay differential equation (DDE) with distance delays, uncertainties and fault signals, first we design an online learning framework via actor-critic RL and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) in order to make drill bit can track pre-designed trajectory accurately and smoothly. Then in order to handle the fault signals problem, we utilize ISMC to eliminate it as weak as possible and rectify drilling trajectory which may derivate original direction caused by it. The system stability and convergence have been analyzed to ensure uniformly ultimately boundedness of tracking errors and fault-tolerant control signals. The proposed method would have wide application potentials in realizing the trajectory tracking and rectification with automatic operations of directional drilling. The effectiveness and accuracy of it are validated by simulation results with ramp and sine input signals."

This study aimed particularly to thoroughly examine through classroom observation and in-depth interviews what the female marriage immigrants' perception of the Korean language would be like and what changes occurred in their sense of identity through the participation experience in the ""Korean Class for Nationality Acquisition Preparation Program"". This study found that the female marriage immigrants' active class participation and their purposes of Korean language learning were not just related to learning the language itself, but also to developing and reinforcing their sense of identity. First, the female marriage immigrants were aware that it is essential to understand the Korean language in settling down in Korea and Korean language can have economic value in combination with their native language. Moreover, they were found to actively invest their time and effort in learning the Korean language as a means of self-realization, which enhanced their learning motivation. Second, the active class participation of female marriage immigrants showed that their purpose for the program is to adapt to Korean society better, rather than to acquire nationality itself since they perceived themselves as a social and cultural subject who voluntarily migrated. In addition, their self-efficacy was improved through the interaction with surrounding people in this process. Third, the female marriage immigrants tried to establish their roles at home as wives and mothers by improving their knowledge and Korean language skills through the program. In particular, their sense of identity as a mother who can guide children's education became stronger. It can be seen that they strengthened their sense of identity positively, constantly negotiating for it through various experiences through the class participation process and learning contents."

Most of the existing studies suggest the generative model which controls one property. Along with creating a generator, one of the most important factors to be considered in designing an algorithm is an optimization method which can simultaneously guarantee various properties that the molecules must have. One way to implement it on a deep generative model is to estimate the posterior distribution through sampling and then optimize the generator in a direction to satisfy multiple purposes. In this manner, we propose a novel method which optimizes the posterior distribution of the generative model with the generated data which satisfy multiple objectives through self-data augmentation and learning by incorporating the Thomson sampling technique into VAE (Variational Auto-Encoder).

First, in order to specify what and how to teach in the metaverse, it is to define the ideal human image that MetaEdu should pursue. The second is a consideration of what to teach, and discusses the new literacy that MetaEdu requires, which connects, expands, edits, and shares thinking. We will propose a practical way to strengthen learners' ability to create their own questions by using 'subject', 'network-space', and 'digital-tools'.This researcher intends to define the ideal human image that MetaEdu should aim for as 'excellent intelligence'. 'Excellent intelligence' creates the value of life by upgrading intellectual ability to overcome the modern life where the average is prevalent, maintains a balanced view so that the network democracy of autonomous symbiosis is not polluted by exclusion and closure, and protects the interests of the community. He is a player who prioritizes, is not afraid of challenges, and strives for a future community where they live together and have fun together. The ability and skill to deal with non-human helpers in the metaverse is ‘metatechne’. The mutual reinforcement experience between the human-subject and the non-human helper is determined by the content items of Metatechne and its proficiency. . Cognitive techne is a skill acquired through repeated learning and coaching by external stimuli, and emotional techne is a skill acquired by spontaneous inner inspiration through individual voluntary will and effort. Although cognitive techne and emotional techne are conceptually distinct, they are closely linked within the MetaEdu learning environment, and in the process, meta techne is naturally accumulated through experience.The purpose of MetaEdu is to ① provide equal educational opportunities to utilize non-human helpers, ② refine the learning level design, and ③ help learners to acquire and develop Metatechne on their own through educational design incorporating game algorithms. ④ To promote the birth of exceptional intelligence. MetaEdu will become a platform for future education, and for this to happen, a change in the perception of university education and disruptive innovation must follow."

A 32-channel Electroencephalography (EEG) device is used to measure imagined speech (SI) of four words (sos, stop, medicine, washroom) and one phrase (come-here) across 13 subjects. A deep long short-term memory (LSTM) network has been adopted to recognize the above signals in seven EEG frequency bands individually in nine major regions of the brain. The results show a maximum accuracy of 73.56% and a network prediction time (NPT) of 0.14 s which are superior to other state-of-the-art techniques in the literature. Our analysis reveals that the alpha band can recognize SI better than other EEG frequencies. To reinforce our findings, the above work has been compared by models based on the gated recurrent unit (GRU), convolutional neural network (CNN), and six conventional classifiers. The results show that the LSTM model has 46.86% more average accuracy in the alpha band and 74.54% less average NPT than CNN. The maximum accuracy of GRU was 8.34% less than the LSTM network. Deep networks performed better than traditional classifiers."

Therefore, it is very important to understand the population data. However, not all countries are well equipped with a system to measure their own population, so in this case, the estimated population rather than the actual population is substituted for the national population data. There may be several methods of estimating the population of countries classified as underdeveloped, but in this study, an indirect population estimation method using night satellite image was proposed. While known methods use night satellite images as auxiliary information for population estimation, the method proposed in this study proposes a model that estimates the population only with night satellite image. A model was proposed to estimate the grid population using the DMSP-OLS (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program) nighttime satellite image provided by the US NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). For model development, South Korea s night satellite image and grid population were used excluding Seoul and the metropolitan area, and statistical models and ensemble models of machine learning were compared to obtain optimal results from the proposed model.

To increase the effectiveness of expository writing, the process of discussion was added to the design stage, so each group was told to set up the discussion plan, to conduct a discussion, and to write a report on the results of discussion.As a result, in the process of preparing for discussion, the learners expanded the perspective on social issues and perceived the importance of data collection. In the process of conducting the discussion, they expanded the argument and discovered logical errors. In the process of writing down a report on the results of discussion, they clearly organized the contents of discussion, and then used them for expository writing afterwards. The learners mostly showed positive responses to expository writing using discussions, and also responded that the discussion was practically helpful for expository writing. Especially, the learners who were experiencing difficulties in mutual communications due to the COVID-19 pandemic, positively evaluated the collaborative learning of group discussion in the aspect of experiencing close communications between learners during the non-face-to-face lecture. However, in order to increase the effectiveness of expository writing course, it would be necessary to add the process of examining and checking the preparation for discussion, and also to reinforce the feedback process between professor and learner in the expository writing process."

Furthermore, due to the decrease of school age population, universities’ priority has become surviving in the competition, which has led them to discard the proper attitude of scholarly pursuit and turn into job training facility. Under these circumstances, it has been long since Classical Chinese courses such as “Classical Chinese Liberal Education” have become unpopular due to the perception that they are difficult and obsolete. Therefore, I have transformed the class into an introspective course in which the learners can learn classical Chinese and interpret classics in the contemporary context through the education that merged readings in classical Chinese with writing. Based on some level of accomplishment this has brought about, I would like to propose a few ways and directions of improvement.First, this paper examines the changes occurring to academic learning in the age of digital culture and neoliberalism, criticizes the problems of these changes, explores personalization process by way of exploring the contemporary meaning of classical Chinese literature and paper writing, and finally overviews students’ response to these classes. Looking at the opinions of the students who took the course, I could see that they feel the need for this kind of class. However, they also pointed out a few problems: the course title is too old-fashioned and stiff that it feels less accessible; also, number of enrolled students are too large that in-depth discussion is impossible and the it is difficult to have every paper corrected in detail. Also, lecturers must also put in greater amount of work in preparing these classes since they not only study classical Chinese, but also have to cross between the texts from the East and the West, or the contemporary and classical texts.Yet, there is also a saying that “review the old to learn the new.” Even if the time changes, one cannot discard the essence of university classes. Hence, a few of suggestions that I would like to propose are changing the title to something students may be intrigued to, and allowing the students to learn classical characters in a fun and easy manner, while maintaining the readings in classical Chinese. Also, instead of teaching many sentences, allowing students to be self-reflect by teaching the meaning of even a single sentence through cross-text and based on their interest. In the end, I would like to provide the students with an opportunity to personalize it by writing their own papers."

At that point, the students were given a high-stakes task to describe designed major name, curriculum design table and subject planning, and plan for completion, etc. in detail. Second, in order to use the student design major system, students must have ‘understanding systems and procedures’, ‘cultivation of basic knowledge for curriculum design’, and ‘curriculum design competency’. Each can be proposed for the purpose of a student design major support plan, and differentiated support must be provided according to the university-affiliated. Third, as a result of conducting the perception survey for support plan to reinforce the students' major design capabilities as an object of 281 students in the university ‘A’, they answered that it was necessary to reinforce the major design capabilities to provide actual data supply and supply of learning opportunity in order of data distribution of major design exemplification, sharing meeting of major design exemplification, and distribution of guidebook. There was a difference in the degree of recognition of the need for support measures by university-affiliated.Conclusions To conclude, based on these research findings above, this study was to suggest a practical plan to support the students who wanted to complete their student designed majors in the future, and concept and procedural knowledge that must be guided."

Most audiences want to get help with childcare, learn the role of parenting, and have fun at the same time through parenting entertainment tv programs. Parenting entertainment programs are highly trusted by audiences due to their reality, and they affect on audiences’ parenting values, attitudes. Considering the impact and the influence of parenting entertainment tv program, it is necessary to explore to the respect for and protection of children's rights in parenting entertainment TV programs.This study aims to enhance social awareness of child rights by examining the recognition of child rights in parenting entertainment tv programs, and to provide implications for the production of child-centered parenting entertainment tv programs. For this, content analysis was conducted by monitoring a total of 70 videos and audience’s responses on parenting entertainment tv programs posted on the YouTube account of the broadcasting company.The study results were as follows: First, it was found that thumbnails and subtitles of parenting entertainment program videos are attribution-biased and infringe on child rights by caricatures of personality and behavior. This is an area that requires discussion of the appropriateness of children's developmental problems as a program with an entertainment format. Second, it was found that caricatures of children in parenting entertainment programs infringe on child right. This includes exposing the child's body, covering the child's face with food such as seaweed, adorning the child's dissatisfaction with adhesive tape, intentionally surprising the child with a hidden camera, and creating false discipline situations. Third, it was found that viewers' insulting comments about children appearing in parenting entertainment programs infringe on child right. This is an act that infringes on a child's privacy and does not consider the child safety. The insults of children are further reinforced as responses are induced and radicalized through “like” replies from third-party users to written comments. In view of the large social and cultural impact of childcare entertainment programs, child right and protection should be considered first in the media production process.Based on the above research results, suggestion were made so that the parenting entertainment TV program could enhance the public's awareness and sensitivity of children's rights. Through follow-up research, it is expected that academic discourse on media and children's rights will be formed and active research will be conducted."

The R&D collaboration is divided into vertical cooperation within the value chain and horizontal cooperation beyond value chain. The first key finding from empirical analysis is that both vertical and horizontal R&D collaborations have significantly positive impacts on technology based competitive advantages. The vertical R&D collaboration has more impacts on competitive advantages than horizontal R&D collaboration. This suggests that R&D collaboration with purchasers and suppliers plays a greater role for venture organizations’ competitiveness. Second, the potential knowledge based absorption capacity and mutual goodwill trust also work significantly to reinforce the positive influences of R&D collaboration to the competitive advantage. This implies that mutual trust between partners participating in collaboration and absorption capacity within venture organizations would strengthen the effectiveness of R&D cooperation. This study provides the practical implications that the performance and effectiveness of R&D collaboration may rely on the nature of cooperation partners and internal organization capability."

Data were collected through questionnaires or interviews over three years on how PMTs recognized the CPP tasks as a tool to cultivate students’ creativity and character in secondary schools. The results of the study are as follows. First, PMTs recognized regardless of their CPP experience that CPP might have a positive impact on improving students’ ability to devise various ideas and that it positively influences students’ attitudes toward building interpersonal relationships, including teamwork, respect, and consideration. Second, the experience of PMTs participating in the CPP made them more positively aware that CPP is effective in improving students’ ability to elaborate on ideas. Third, the PMTs’ experience of participating in CPP led to a more positive perception of the impact of CPP on the students’ abilities and attitudes, namely, the students’ ability to elaborate on ideas and their inner attitudes toward individuals, including honesty, fairness, and responsibility, and the attitude of students regarding logically presenting their opinions and making rational decisions.

To this end, prior research related to curriculum consulting was analyzed and a teacher-learning community centered on the same grade was formed to reconstruct the teacher-level curriculum. In addition, elementary school teachers participating in the curriculum conference were interviewed and a basic survey on the maturity of the curriculum was conducted through an open questionnaire. After that, 24 component factors needed for elementary school teachers were derived through a Delphi survey on the expert group and the selection of component factors of curriculum maturity. However, through the selection meeting of the curriculum expert group, the final 20 component factors were selected by excluding the component factors that were difficult to reinforce the reconfiguration capacity through curriculum consulting.Specifically, in order to compose a systematic curriculum consulting program, the curriculum maturity that elementary school teachers should have was classified into four core scales: curriculum diversity, curriculum systems, curriculum specificity, and curriculum effectiveness. In addition, the curriculum maturity reflected in the curriculum consulting program was refined into the competency and execution level of the curriculum for each core scale, and the curriculum consulting program was devised by modularizing it. In other words, in order to effectively operate the curriculum consulting program, each module consists of 4 stages: Diagnosis, Deliberation, Development, and Advancement.

As for the contents, recent development has been to designate an individual section for ‘culture’-aside from Chinese characters or reading classical Chinese writings-and to suggest activities that help with learning the ‘language and culture’ of countries in the Sinosphere. 2015 Revised classical Chinese textbooks are also generally complying to the contents elements advised by the educational curriculum; and some textbooks have managed to successfully achieve the curriculum’s objective in creative ways.Based on this analysis, this paper first explores the problems in the current ways of applying the concept ‘Sinosphere’ to classical Chinese education, and proceeds to suggest the alternative. First, the flaw in the logic that classical Chinese would facilitate communication within Sinosphere has been pointed out; as learning classical Chinese may be less efficient compared to directly learning the language, and as it might not be effective in contemporary media environment. In search of the alternative, the concept ‘Sinosphere’ would have to be more clearly articulated in the education curriculum. While Korea is historically and regionally included in the civilization called the Sinosphere, it is nowadays ‘not a country in which Chinese character is popularly used’. Therefore, the aim to secure a competitive edge in culture, against other countries in Sinosphere, should be emphasized in conveying the importance of educating classical Chinese characters and writings. Also, there appears to be a problem in the tendency to limit the scope of educational contents concerning ‘Sinosphere’ to the acquisition of ‘knowledge on culture’. While the domain of ‘culture’ should be extensively applied to include the entirety of literature, thoughts, history, and culture of East Asian Sinosphere, the aim should be to understand the ‘spiritual culture’ of Sinosphere as an outcome of education in Chinese character and classical Chinese. The significations of the East Asian classics that are included in current textbooks should be made clear in the context of intellectual history of Sinosphere. Moreover, making use of the records that show the history of mutual exchange within the Sinosphere-namely sahaengnok (records of envoy trips to Japan), yŏnhaengnok (records of envoy trips to China), brush talks, and letters-might prove to be fruitful.As a concept which interlaces with current demands, ‘Sinosphere’ might substantially contribute in reinforcing the status of classical Chinese education. Still, the mode of application calls for a continued review; more than anything, the approach should be made with a long-term perspective in regards to setting the objectives of classical Chinese education."

For this purpose, 475 students taking liberal arts courses at A Univ. located in the metropolitan area were evaluated on their experiences of taking liberal arts courses, awareness and necessity of lecture structure, learning activities, academic achievement, academic achievement, and evaluation.Methods As an analysis method, as a result of examining the requirement ranking by factor through the Borich’s Requirement Formula and the The Locus for Focus Model, it was found that there was a statistically significant difference in the t-test for importance and current level.Results First, the content showing the highest trend among the teachers' requests for lesson design perceived by learners was the composition of various theoretical lectures and learning activities tailored to liberal arts subjects. Second, it is necessary for teachers to improve students' ability to solve problems and think through liberal arts classes, and to have frequent opportunities for mutual communication between professors and learners.Third, students perceived positively both at the current level and importance in relation to the liberal arts class grade evaluation. Fourth, students gave an overall positive evaluation of the current liberal arts curriculum.Conclusions The researcher first needs to reinforce the lesson design that can communicate well with each other regardless of the type of class in order to increase the educational performance and effectiveness between professors and learners. It was suggested that universities and professors are required to prepare a standard system that can autonomously design lessons according to new lesson types and monitor learners' learning performance."

Challenges of diet planning for children using artificial intelligence,2022,"['Children', 'dieticians', 'artificial intelligence', 'diet planning']",,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Diet planning in childcare centers is difficult because of the required knowledge of nutrition and development as well as the high design complexity associated with large numbers of food items. Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to provide diet-planning solutions via automatic and effective application of professional knowledge, addressing the complexity of optimal diet design. This study presents the results of the evaluation of the utility of AI-generated diets for children and provides related implications.MATERIALS/METHODS: We developed 2 AI solutions for children aged 3–5 yrs using a generative adversarial network (GAN) model and a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. After training these solutions to produce daily diet plans, experts evaluated the human- and AI-generated diets in 2 steps.RESULTS: In the evaluation of adequacy of nutrition, where experts were provided only with nutrient information and no food names, the proportion of strong positive responses to RL-generated diets was higher than that of the human- and GAN-generated diets (P < 0.001). In contrast, in terms of diet composition, the experts’ responses to human-designed diets were more positive when experts were provided with food name information (i.e., composition information).CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the development and evaluation of AI to support dietary planning for children. This study demonstrates the possibility of developing AI-assisted diet planning methods for children and highlights the importance of composition compliance in diet planning. Further integrative cooperation in the fields of nutrition, engineering, and medicine is needed to improve the suitability of our proposed AI solutions and benefit children’s well-being by providing high-quality diet planning in terms of both compositional and nutritional criteria."

Game visual effects, one of the game graphics elements, provide special visual effects on the character, background, and interface to convey information about the character’s state or current behavior, and is limited by computer technology, but is also the most noticeable visual fun factor in game graphics. Since it is expressed as an abstract image, it is important to visualize the implied and symbolic meaning for information transmission. <World of Warcraft> is MMORPG where the expression of the character’s skill visual effects is important due to the strong content of PVP (Player VS Player) due to the confrontation between the Horde and the Alliance camp. By classifying the visual effects of <World of Warcraft> into attack and weakening/recovery and reinforcement, this study finds archetypes shared in the unconsciousness of mankind reproduced in the game visual effect and analyzes the meaning of symbols.Historically, humans have created very similar myths and images, and in between there existed archetypes, the same order that penetrated them. The human archetypes are reproduced through symbols, and it requires a high degree of creative imagination to create a new symbol. The form shown in game visual effects has a universal symbol that can be obtained without our recognition, and players interpret and learn symbols through imagination while playing the game.The symbolic expression of the form conveys the meaning of game visual effects and at the same time stimulates the player’s imagination to immerse himself in the game. As a result of the study, game visual effects showed that the universal form, archetype of mankind, was recreated by imagination to express symbolism related to the worldview of the game, and that a unique symbolic system was built, not just an image."

This study examined the educational goals and contents emphasized in dealing with war issues in Reconciliation Education and Peace Education. Then, the current situation was analyzed focusing on the curriculum and government educational materials, and the significance and limitations were presented, and then the direction for improvement was presented.The reason war is treated as a subject of class in schools is to contribute to creating a more peaceful society by not only understanding war itself as a historical fact, but also understanding how war can destroy human life. The improvement directions suggested as a result of the study are as follows. First, war should be a process of learning lessons from various life contexts. Second, it is necessary to fundamentally reflect on why the Korean War is dealt with in the curriculum, and present an educational goal that reinforces a peaceful approach. Third, in order to form a peaceful relationship between the South Korea and the North Korea, the memory of war must be converted into a communal memory. Fourth, the curriculum should be organically reorganized with goals and contents that match the nature of the subject in various subjects. Fifth, the curriculum, textbooks, and other educational materials should be structured in consideration of the developmental level of students by school level.This study is meaningful in that it comprehensively reviewed the education on the Korean War in elementary, middle, and high schools and suggested directions for improvement. If new curriculum, textbooks, and instrumental education materials are developed and applied in the future, applying the approaches of Reconciliation Education and Peace Education, it will be possible to transform the deeply engraved hostility after the Korean War into reconciliation and lay the foundation for peaceful inter-Korean relations."

고객 요구에 대한 방해요인 평가가 직무열의와 적응판매행동에 미치는 영향 연구 : 고객지향성·판매지향성의 조절효과,2022,"['Hindrance appraisal of customer demand', 'Work engagement', 'Adaptive selling', 'Customer orientation', 'Selling orientation']",,"This paper aims to identify the influence of customer demand on the adaptive selling of department store employees based on the job demand and resource(JD-R) model. Store managers consider front-line employees as one of the important resources to obtain a competitive advantage. It is because employees contribute greatly to securing new customers and loyal customers when they interact with customers.Customers sometimes, however, ask the salespeople for excessive demand and use insulting words toward the salesperson. Negative experience from customers makes salesperson get stressed, emotionally exhausted. The JD-R model well explains the relationship between employees’ burnout and job engagement. Based on the JD-R model, the authors try to check the effect of customers’ hindrance requirements on work engagement and adaptive selling. In addition, this study examines customer( selling) orientation as a moderating variable that mitigates(reinforces) the negative effect of customer demand on employees’ work engagement.Salespeople must respond to customer requests. According to the JD-R model, customers’ excessive and diverse requests can be a demanding factor for salespeople. For employees, customer demands naturally lead to negative job out-comes because they create tension or emotional burnout. When salespeople perceive customer needs as barriers or obstacles, they experience negative emotions. Job resources, however, alleviate these negative impacts. Intrinsic motivation of salespeople such as customer orientation helps to reduce role conflict and manage task pressure. Customer-oriented employees are interested in learning about their customers and providing optimal solutions to them. Since encounters play a key role in delivering value by interacting with customers, customer orientation can be considered as a job resource that enhances employees’ work engagement. Selling orientation, on the other hand, reinforces the negative impact of customer requests on work engagement. As an opposite concept of customer orientation, selling orientation focuses on sales performance, not customers’ well-being or needs. It means that sales-oriented employees tend to maximize their short-term profits through sales activities. If employees who value short-term goals are required to handle hindrance demands from customers, they will focus only on the given situation. Therefore, rather than feeling enthusiasm, dedication, or a positive sense of achievement for the job, they will focus on completing the task in front of them. It means that the negative impact of customer requests on work engagement will be stronger.Numerous studies claim that work engagement is associated with positive job performance. Employees with high work engagement showed higher in-role and extra- role behaviors than employees who did not. In other words, salespeople with high work engagement not only do the assigned work but also care for customer needs and change sales behavior while interacting with customers.For this study, salespeople working in department stores in South Korea were asked to participate in the survey. Hypotheses were tested based on 437 responses using SmartPLS and SPSS. It is found that customer’s hindrance requests negatively influence employee’s work engagement, and consequently weaken the adaptive selling. Customer orientation, however, alleviates the negative impacts of hindrance requests on work engagement, while selling orientation intensifies. This study suggests the following academic and practical implications. First, this study broadens the understanding of the JD-R model. In previous studies, sales orientation was considered as a positive moderator. However, this study covered that when employees face a negative situation, their selling orientation worsens the negative impact of customer requests on work engagement. Second, the authors suggest store managers should support and take measures to support salespeople be..."

Seong Hyeon recorded an anecdote about his colleague, Chae Su, in 『Yongjaechonghwa』 while Kim An-ro wrote 『Yongcheondamjeokgi』 in exile at the time when 『Yongjaechonghwa』 was published including an anecdote of his father-in-law, Chae Su, in it. In this sense, 『Yongjaechonghwa』 and 『Yongcheondamjeokgi』 work as records on political fluctuations in the 15th and 16th centuries and as cross-narratives to understand Chae Su’s 『Seolgongchanjeon 』. In 『Yongjaechonghwa』, Chae Su is depicted as Sadaebu equipped with literary talent and wit, and in 『Yongcheondamjeokgi』, he highlights Chae Su’s reputation from a son-in-law’s standpoint. This is primarily attributed to the difference of relationship as a friend and son-in-law, but it provides a piece of information that the person named Chae Su was not the owner of unconventional ideas. In the context of 『Yongjaechonghwa』, the ban of 『Seolgongchanjeon』 stems from the gap between narrative verisimilitudity and the form of a traditional narrative, and the context of 『Yongcheondamjeokgi 』 provides the logic that 『Seolgongchanjeon』 is grounded on the true story, which dilutes the unconventionality of the work. In conclusion, by comparing the articles of 『Yongjaechonghwa』 and 『Yongcheondamjeokgi』, this author could learn that the 『Seolgongchanjeon』 shock originated from the perspective of investigating Cha Sue’s ideas to see his political orientation. Also, with 『Yongjaechonghwa』, it was possible to find out newly about the fact that the Chinese envoy, ‘Aebak’, appearing in 『Seolgongchanjeon』 was a real person. This reveals a different perspective from the elements previously presented for the ban of 『Seolgongchanjeon』, for instance, possession or the experience of ghost or the afterworld. This is because such subject matters are frequently mentioned in 『Yongjaechonghwa』, too, and even Seong Hyeon himself describes his own stories about seeing ghosts. Moreover, Chae Su’s story about experiencing ghost in 『Yongcheondamjeokgi』 serves as an anecdote that reinforces the fact that the ban of 『Seolgongchanjeon』 that formed the center of controversy before was not intended but it came from the writer’s own experience. Therefore, cross-examination over 『Yongjaechonghwa』 and 『Yongcheondamjeokgi』 presents multidimensional information about Chae Su and provides new context that is useful to understand 『Seolgongchanjeon』."

As for the analysis method, ANOVA, t-test, and cross-analysis were performed to check the differences between groups with descriptive statistical analysis and frequency analysis for each question using the data of current students who responded to the questionnaire.Results To summarize the results of the analysis, First, as for the participation status of the extracurricular program, the student participation in the first and second graders, the College of Science and Technology Convergence and the College of Design and Arts was low, and the participation of female students was higher than that of male students. In addition, students had high demands for publicity using website announcements and awarding mileage scholarships and prize money. Second, the ‘extracurricular mileage’ was highly recognized in the operation method of the extracurricular program, and the online extracurricular program took advantage of the ‘online environment regardless of location’ and ‘internet use of PC/smart devices’ as the strengths, ‘decreased concentration’ and ‘Difficulty in interaction between instructors and students’ was recognized as a disadvantage. Third, satisfaction with ‘instructor's professionalism’ and ‘program theme’ was high in the learning outcomes of the extracurricular program, and ‘various experiences outside of the subject’ and ‘help in understanding and adapting to university life’ were highly recognized as the program participation outcomes. Fourth, students' demands for extracurricular programs were highly supported by school policy that reinforced core competency certification system, mileage and scholarships. In addition, there was a high demand for application for the subject-related extracurricular program, and the employment support program was the most important, and it was hoped that the certificate application and computer application program would be opened first.Conclusions This study is meaningful in that it provided implications by statistically analyzing the perceptions and needs of current students based on the process and output aspects of the extracurricular program, and identifying differences by gender, grade, and college. Through this, it is expected that it will be used to improve the perception of university members on extracurricular education and to establish a direction for establishing an operating system."

To this end, the study selected Netflix original content “The Social Dilemma” for analysis and adopted narrative analysis as the research method. The analysis results confirmed that “Social Dilemma” showed the structure of a traditional current affairs documentary and mainly used experts and statistical data to develop the story. It also reinforced core content claims by enumerating domestic and foreign cases such as the 2021 Myanmar massacre and the spread of fake news. In addition, the relationship between the characters clearly revealed the binary opposition between developers and media companies as well as users and advertisers. For the solution to the problem, strong regulations on businesses and the suspension of social media use were reached. However, “The Social Dilemma” merely pointed out the misuse of AI technology and had a narrative that ignored human identity and social relationships. Such results raise the need for creating contents that emphasize the importance of human sociality, relationships, and learning ability in the age of AI."

A total of 91 professors from ‘A’ university participated to measure TPACK. The LMS usage data from 567 courses administered in 2021 were collected and analyzed. Correlation analysis was conducted to verify the correlation between the professors’ TPACK and LMS usage. Two-way ANOVA was conducted to identify LMS usage according to course characteristics. To classify the types of online instructional design, cluster analysis was conducted based on professors’ TPACK, course characteristics, and LMS usage. The results were as follows. First, there was a very weak correlation between the professor's TPACK and LMS usage of 'notice' and 'archive'. Second, there was a difference in the LMS usage according to course charateristics in 'notice', 'archive', 'quizzes', and 'total usage'. Third, LMS usage patterns was classified into five clusters designated as ‘1: interaction-oriented’, ‘2: evaluation-oriented’, ‘3: passive usage’, ‘4: focused on notice/material services’, and '5: focused on notice/assignment'. In summary, this study found that the TPACK evaluated by the university professors did not significantly affect the online instructional design using LMS, but rather there was a significant difference in LMS usage according to course characteristics. The most common type was ‘3: passive usage’, and most professors used the LMS tool very limitedly. As a platform for facilitating learning in university online classes, various tools and functions of the LMS should be actively utilized in a variety of ways according to the course characteristics. Since PACK evaluated by the university professors has little effect on online instructional design using LMS, universities should focus on teaching support that can reinforce essential variables."

As a major cause of crisis response, in the context of a democratic developmental state, Korea has formed an efficient government to implement rational plans for crisis management. In addition, Korea reaches a broad consensus with citizens to overcome the crisis, by taking advantage of a democratic regime. Furthermore, due to the universal health insurance system and the centralized Center for Disease Control and Prevention based on ICT, the government improved performances of crisis response. Finally, a communitarian political culture based on strong nationalism is also a favorable foundation for building a consensus-oriented society. As an outcome variable, crisis response capacities are measured through the ratio of confirmed patients to the population, quality of life, and economic growth even under the pandemic. My institutional analysis explains the process of institutional evolution into a democratic developmental state to evaluate Korea’s crisis response. Korea has experienced institutional evolution after the 1997 financial crisis as a critical juncture, as well as after the 2014 Ferry Sewol disaster and the 2015 MERS outbreak as major crises. In addition, in 2016, Korea’s democratic governance has been improved as Korea seeks political reforms in the wake of candlelight vigils. Korea failed in the initial crisis response in the MERS outbreak. However, institutional learning through past crises became the basis for success in the COVID-19 crisis. In the short term, Korea’s crisis response was successful, but in the long term, economic democratization and development into a universal welfare state can improve democratic governance, reinforcing its state capacity to effectively respond to health and disease management."

The exploratory factor analysis and reliability analysis were performed to secure the validity and reliability of the scale, and the Pearson correlation analysis was performed to confirm the correlation between the major variables. To verify the regula-tory effect, the hierarchical regulation regression analysis was performed, and the test was confirmed with a simple slope graph according to the significant interaction effect.Results: As a result of the analysis performed, significant results were confirmed with a focus on the three stages in which all variables were input together. In the first stage, the characteristics of short-form beauty con-tents of the independent variables were static, all in playfulness, information, reliability, creativity, and interac-tivity. As the influence of individual personality on the behavioral intention in the second stage, it was confirmed that extroversion, affinity, and neurosis were significant. It was verified that the interaction variables that can confirm the regulatory effect in the third stage were the interaction between playfulness and sincerity(=.114, p<.05), the interaction between playfulness and neurosis(=.091, p<.05), reliability and the interaction of affin-ity(=.096, p<.05) was positively significant, and the interaction of information and affinity was negatively signif-icant(=-.156, p<.01).Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, it was possible to learn that, playfulness and reliability reinforce the behavioral intention in the characteristics of short-form beauty contents. Behavioral intention increases as individual personality integrity, neurosis, and evolution are regulated, whereas informationality deteriorates as the evolutionary nature increases, and it was also found that a strategy of creating and planning useful infor-mation that may be enjoyed or shared is necessary to provide an optimal experience of content, considering the characteristics and individual personalities of Generation MZ users, and accordingly, offers a meaning for the basic data for digital marketing."

Jaeinchung is considered an important object in the academic circle, however, its origin and history is not studied in detail. In the current context, there is a tendency to use a few well-known materials as the representative explanations for a specific period of time and circumstances. In this study, the related materials are studied in depth and the focus is mainly on contextualizing the establishment circumstances of Jaeinchung. In addition, Jaeinchung is an organization of performers who not only led the national events such as Narye(儺禮) but also the local art tradition. Therefore, the aspects of the whole era including the cases of the 20th century will be covered. This will disclose the transmission history of Jaeinchung and its practical functions in a comprehensive manner.The representative documents of Jaeinchung 「Gapsinwanmun」 and「Gyenggido Chanjaedochungahn」 mention the Byungja year(1636) and the Gapjin year(1784) and the context before and after these events need to be scrutinized. In consideration of the main flow, when it became difficult to mobilize performers through the administrative organization, beginning the year of 1636, Narye was entrusted to the autonomous performers’ organization. This format continued until 1784 when Narye was officially abrogated. Through this process, from the late 18th century, Jaeinchung emerged as a nation-wide organization and in the Gapsin year(1824) when 「Gapsinwanmun」 was documented, Jaeinchung was systematically reorganized. The establishment process reveals that Jaeinchung did not exist as a subordinate unit for national events but it continued to maintain the organization and thrived in its activities through the momentum it gained in private sectors.The organization structure of Jaeinchung shows that it had the central unit to cover the whole nation as well as local units. The internal and external functions of Jaeinchung are as follows: Shinchung(神廳),	a term that shows it is related to warriors.Akgongchung(樂工廳),	a term that shows that it is a unit of professional musicians who worked for government offices.Jangakchung(掌樂廳),	a term that shows that it is an official organization that handled music in the government and offices.Gwangdaechung(廣大廳),	a term that shows that it is a unit of clowns.Mubuchung(巫夫廳),	a term that shows that it is a unit of warrior.and etc.The main functions cover the performance for the central and local government, the activities to protect the interests of the performers’ unit, the function to transmit the instrument playing and dance, the activities to reinforce the solidarity of the organization, and finally the function to set up and promulgate the regulations and rules for performers. Among these, the function that is directly related to the performers do provide evidence to learning the local characteristics of folklore. Jaeinchung served various and complex functions.The Jaeinchung documents provide a window into the life of local Jaeinchung in the 19th century. Chungcheongdo Jaeinchung documents show that it served an external role for its performers to travel to Seoul and perform without hazard. Local Jaeinchung tried to protect the interests of its performers and provide a stable performing environment. There is a detailed record that is related to protecting the interests of performers’ unit in Jangheung shincheong but Naju shincheong published a variety of documents for an extended period of time and left a very concrete record in terms of the role with Narye. These all work to show that the respective local Jaeinchung thrived internally and externally. From the late 19th century to the early 20th century, the role of Jaeinchung began to diminish and stop.

The high school credit system has the features that a variety of non-notified subjects can be developed, which are appropriate for the distinct characteristics of a particular region and a school, through the approval process by the metropolitan and provincial offices of education, and that students can choose subjects of their own accord taking their own future careers and aptitudes into consideration. This system of non-notified subjects can be evaluated positively in terms of granting autonomy to the operation of the national curriculum. Yet, it’s worrisome that non-notified subjects may be developed mainly with certain notified subjects selected as the subjects for the College Scholastic Ability Test or those easy to assess in schools and that students may choose non-notified subjects according to their interest regarding the college entrance examination. Accordingly, the current operation of ‘Ethics and Thought’, which is expected to be excluded from the elective subjects of the College Scholastic Ability Test, and the institutional problems of non-notified subjects were investigated, and an example of developing a non-notified subject related to ‘Ethics and Thought’ was suggested while its connectivity to and complementation of the moral subject curriculum were considered. In this thesis, ‘Ethics and Thought’, which divides categories into the eastern and western ethical and social ideologies including Korean ones in the 2015 Revised National Curriculum, was reorganized with the areas by the value relation expansion method, and the ways to develop non-notified subjects were proposed. In addition, for better substantialization of the laws and policies regarding character education and civil education, the core values which can strengthen the development of morality and citizenship were to be reinforced with non-notified subjects. Above all, all content categories consisted of questions for students to go through the learning process of discussion and introspection and therefore to strengthen their capabilities so that they could come across essential questions they could experience and face in their real lives. Non-notified subjects are expected to be established, which can supplement educational effectiveness so that the knowledge in ‘Ethics and Thought’ can be internalized and become practical wisdom in students in the future."

Frequency analysis, descriptive statistical analysis, correlation analysis, regression analysis, and hierarchical regression analysis were performed based on 232 copies of data collected from May 18 to May 26 in 2017 to analyze the relationship between variables.Results First, the longer the working period of resort workers, the higher the job satisfaction. Second, job satisfaction increases as the mentoring function is strengthened in a situation where the working period is controlled.Third, the career development function among mentoring functions did not increase job satisfaction in a situation where the working period was controlled. Fourth, job satisfaction increases as the psychosocial function among mentoring functions is strengthened in a situation where the working period is controlled. Fifth, job satisfaction increases as the role model function among mentoring functions is strengthened in a situation where the working period is controlled.Conclusions Due to the role of individual employees of resort companies, the role model function and the guidance function were added among the career development functions, which had the greatest effect on job satisfaction. In other words, rather than relying on the mentoring relationship, it can be seen that the behavior, way of thinking, disposition, attitude, job ability, qualifications, and values of individual workers in senior roles actually affect the mentee's job satisfaction improvement. Therefore, one-on-one mentoring programs between seniors and juniors within the organization should be actively introduced to encourage individual job competency reinforcement and self-development, so that organizational adaptability and continuous learning ability can be improved. In addition, in order to further activate the role model function, it will be necessary to appoint an excellent senior or role model for each job as a mentor, or to seek a way to foster excellent mentors."

To this end, we reconfirmed the imperativeness, necessity, and urgency of family faith education by first looking at studies on the subject of family faith education by dividing it into before and during COVID-19. Afterwards, in order to present the family relationship as an essential element of family faith education, the factors affecting the quality of the family were examined. It was confirmed that family health and satisfaction did not depend on the amount of time together, but on what and how they spend time together. Finally, based on this, four directions of family faith education in the endemic era were proposed. Faith education at home in the endemic era should be the standard for faith formation of children. For this, a practical approach is needed to help families prepare and function as the field of faith education, rather than just emphasizing that the family should be the field of faith education and parents should play the role of faith teachers. To achieve this purpose, this study suggests faith education that emphasizes relationships rather than formalities, faith education that strengthens faith community within the family through dialogue, participation and experience, and family culture. As an educational community, the church should care for and teach families and parents for change, recovery, and reinforcement of family. Development of programs that help families and parents to function healthy and effectively as a field of faith education, and development of various active learning programs that help parents improve and restore relationships, including communication with their children, and development of programs to create a Christian culture in the home was left as a follow-up research task or project development."
