MQTT 기반 IoT 환경에서의 PCA와 LightGBM을 이용한 공격 탐지 및 분류 방안,2022,"['MQTTset', 'PCA', 'LightGBM', 'IoT attack detection']","최근 머신러닝 기반의 사이버 공격 탐지 및 분류 연구가 활발히 이루어지고 있으며, 높은 수준의 탐지 정확도를 달성하고 있다. 그러나 저 사양 IoT 기기, 대규모의 네트워크 트래픽 등은 IoT 환경에서 머신러닝 기반의 탐지모델 적용을 어렵게 하고 있다. 따라서 본 논문에서는 국방분야에서도 활용되고 있는 MQTT(Message Queuing Telementry Transport) IoT 프로토콜 환경에서 수집된 데이터세트를 대상으로, 차원축소 기법인 PCA(Principal Component Analysis)와 LightGBM(Light Gradient Boosting Model)을 이용하여 IoT 공격을 효울적으로 탐지 및 분류하는 방안을 제안하였다. 실험을 통해 제안하는 분류모델의 성능을 확인한 결과 원본 데이터세트를 약 15%로 축소하였음에도 원본 전체를 모두 사용한 모델과 거의 유사한 성능을 나타 냈으며, 본 논문에서 선정한 4가지 차원축소기법과의 비교 평가에서도 가장 우수한 성능을 나타냈다.","Recently, machine learning-based cyber attack detection and classification research has been actively conducted, achieving a high level of detection accuracy. However, low-spec IoT devices and large-scale network traffic make it difficult to apply machine learning-based detection models in IoT environment. Therefore, In this paper, we propose an efficient IoT attack detection and classification method through PCA(Principal Component Analysis) and LightGBM(Light Gradient Boosting Model) using datasets collected in a MQTT(Message Queuing Telementry Transport) IoT protocol environment that is also used in the defense field. As a result of the experiment, even though the original dataset was reduced to about 15%, the performance was almost similar to that of the original. It also showed the best performance in comparative evaluation with the four dimensional reduction techniques selected in this paper."
건물의 에너지 벤치마크를 위한 LightGBM기반 분위 회귀 모델,2022,"['건물에너지사용량', '에너지 벤치마크', '분위회귀모델', '유치원', 'Building energy used', 'Energy benchmarking', 'LightGBM', 'Quantile regression', 'Kindergarten']",,"Building energy benchmarking is a crucial step in building energy monitoring. Current benchmarking practices often face limitations rooted in the adopted methodologies. For instance, existing benchmark tools are based on the ordinary least squares regression method, which is highly sensitive to outliers and non-linearity in the dataset; this is likely to produce inaccurate benchmark scores. We propose a quantile regression benchmarking model reinforced with a gradient boosting decision tree algorithm (LightGBM). On the one hand, quantile regression analysis estimates the conditional distribution across quantiles, better capturing non-linearity in building energy behavior at various hierarchies of energy usage. On the other hand, the tree-based algorithm corrects previous errors during model training for better optimization. The said models were developed using a dataset from kindergarten school buildings in South Korea consisting of 3,090 buildings. From the developed models, it was observed that total floor area is a major determining factor in the electric energy use of kindergarten buildings in Korea, while the number of floors was also an energy driving factor in middle energy-consuming buildings. The proposed model provides accurate estimations of building energy performance, better facilitating energy comparison of a given building with its peers. The developed models provide valuable insights for energy conservation programs that might later inform building policies and for individuals wishing to reduce the energy consumption of their facilities."

In particular, accurate short-term load forecasting (STLF) is essential in establishing energy strategies in the energy management system, a significant element of the smart grid; herein, external factors, such as time-stamps and weather information, and historical electric load are utilized as input variables for the construction of STLF models. However, various internal and external aspects may cause missing values in smart meter data, which deteriorate the performance of the forecasting model due to a lack of training data. To address this issue, this study proposes a missing value imputation method for smart meter data. We first collect building electrical energy consumption data from commercial and industrial buildings in South Korea and configure various input variables related to the building electrical energy consumption. We then construct a missing value imputation model based on LightGBM (short for Light Gradient Boosting Machine) to replace missing values via 5-fold and 10-fold cross-validations, assuming that 20% and 10% of the missing values exist. We finally apply SHAP (short for SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the LightGBM model for different buildings and cross-validations to represent the interpretability of these models. Through various experiments, the LightGBM model derived better performance than other famous machine learning models in missing value imputation, and the input variables related to the days of the week were the significant variables in constructing the missing value imputation model."

According to this issue, the proportion of solar energy is expanding due to its high business potential among renewable energies, and various works have been proposed to precisely predict solar power generation for efficient energy management and stable power supply. However, previous works include data of night time when solar power is not generated, and this method leads to low forecasting accuracy. Also, they have limitations in explaining how the forecasting results are derived. To solve these problems, we propose a solar power generation forecasting scheme based on explainable AI(Artificial Intelligence) reflecting time period patterns of the sun. We selected time pattern variables showing high correlation with solar power generation and transformed them into a pattern reflecting the solar cycle. We then excluded data of night time and compared the performances of various machine learning models. Experimental results proved that utilizing LightGBM with only daytime input variables showed the best forecasting performance, and solar radiation had the most significant influence among the input variables."

A Study on Fraud Detection in the C2C Used Trade Market Using Doc2vec,2022,"['Fraud Detection', 'Online C2C Resale Market', 'Doc2vec', 'LightGBM', 'SHAP', '사기 탐지', '온라인 C2C 중고거래 시장']",,"In this paper, we propose a machine learning model that can prevent fraudulent transactions in advance and interpret them using the XAI approach. For the experiment, we collected a real data set of 12,258 mobile phone sales posts from Joonggonara, a major domestic online C2C resale trading platform. Characteristics of the text corresponding to the post body were extracted using Doc2vec, dimensionality was reduced through PCA, and various derived variables were created based on previous research. To mitigate the data imbalance problem in the preprocessing stage, a complex sampling method that combines oversampling and undersampling was applied. Then, various machine learning models were built to detect fraudulent postings. As a result of the analysis, LightGBM showed the best performance compared to other machine learning models. And as a result of SHAP, if the price is unreasonably low compared to the market price and if there is no indication of the transaction area, there was a high probability that it was a fraudulent post. Also, high price, no safe transaction, the more the courier transaction, and the higher the ratio of 0 in the price also led to fraud."
Explainable Machine Learning Based a Packed Red Blood Cell Transfusion Prediction and Evaluation for Major Internal Medical Condition,2022,"['Explainable AI', 'Feature Importance Analysis', 'LightGBM', 'Partial Dependence Plot', 'Prediction', 'Transfusion']",,"Efficient use of limited blood products is becoming very important in terms of socioeconomic status and patientrecovery. To predict the appropriateness of patient-specific transfusions for the intensive care unit (ICU)patients who require real-time monitoring, we evaluated a model to predict the possibility of transfusiondynamically by using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III), an ICU admissionrecord at Harvard Medical School. In this study, we developed an explainable machine learning to predict thepossibility of red blood cell transfusion for major medical diseases in the ICU. Target disease groups thatreceived packed red blood cell transfusions at high frequency were selected and 16,222 patients were finallyextracted. The prediction model achieved an area under the ROC curve of 0.9070 and an F1-score of 0.8166(LightGBM). To explain the performance of the machine learning model, feature importance analysis and apartial dependence plot were used.

분리학습 모델을 이용한 수출액 예측 및 수출 유망국가 추천,2022,"['수출액 예측', '머신러닝', '분리학습', 'Exports prediction', 'Machine learning', 'Separated learning', 'LightGBM', 'SHapley value']",,"One of the characteristics of South Korea’s economic structure is that it is highly dependent on exports. Thus, many businesses are closely related to the global economy and diplomatic situation. In addition, small and medium-sized enterprises(SMEs) specialized in exporting are struggling due to the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a model to forecast exports for next year to support SMEs export strategy and decision making. Also, this study proposed a strategy to recommend promising export countries of each item based on the forecasting model.  We analyzed important variables used in previous studies such as country-specific, item-specific, and macro-economic variables and collected those variables to train our prediction model. Next, through the exploratory data analysis(EDA) it was found that exports, which is a target variable, have a highly skewed distribution. To deal with this issue and improve predictive performance, we suggest a separated learning method. In a separated learning method, the whole dataset is divided into homogeneous subgroups and a prediction algorithm is applied to each group. Thus, characteristics of each group can be more precisely trained using different input variables and algorithms. In this study, we divided the dataset into five subgroups based on the exports to decrease skewness of the target variable. After the separation, we found that each group has different characteristics in countries and goods. For example, In Group 1, most of the exporting countries are developing countries and the majority of exporting goods are low value products such as glass and prints. On the other hand, major exporting countries of South Korea such as China, USA, and Vietnam are included in Group 4 and Group 5 and most exporting goods in these groups are high value products.  Then we used LightGBM(LGBM) and Exponential Moving Average(EMA) for prediction. Considering the characteristics of each group, models were built using LGBM for Group 1 to 4 and EMA for Group 5. To evaluate the performance of the model, we compare different model structures and algorithms. As a result, it was found that the separated learning model had best performance compared to other models. After the model was built, we also provided variable importance of each group using SHAP-value to add explainability of our model.  Based on the prediction model, we proposed a second-stage recommendation strategy for potential export countries. In the first phase, BCG matrix was used to find Star and Question Mark markets that are expected to grow rapidly. In the second phase, we calculated scores for each country and recommendations were made according to ranking. Using this recommendation framework, potential export countries were selected and information about those countries for each item was presented.  There are several implications of this study. First of all, most of the preceding studies have conducted research on the specific situation or country. However, this study use various variables and develops a machine learning model for a wide range of countries and items. Second, as to our knowledge, it is the first attempt to adopt a separated learning method for exports prediction. By separating the dataset into 5 homogeneous subgroups, we could enhance the predictive performance of the model. Also, more detailed explanation of models by group is provided using SHAP values.  Lastly, this study has several practical implications. There are some platforms which serve trade information including KOTRA, but most of them are based on past data. Therefore, it is not easy for companies to predict future trends. By utilizing the model and recommendation strategy in this research, trade related services in each platform can be improved so that companies including SMEs can fully utilize the service when making strategies and decisions for exports."

This paper suggests a flight prediction model and rules by analyzing the correlation between flight implementation and cancellation according to weather conditions by using big data collected from historical flight information of military aircraft supplied by Korean manufacturers and meteorological information from the Korea Meteorological Administration. In addition, by deriving flight rules according to weather information, it was possible to discover an efficient flight schedule establishment method in consideration of weather information.Design/methodology/approach This study is an analytic study using data mining techniques based on flight historical data of 44,558 flights of military aircraft accumulated by the Republic of Korea Air Force for a total of 36 months from January 2013 to December 2015 and meteorological information provided by the Korea Meteorological Administration. Four steps were taken to develop optimal flight prediction models and to derive rules for flight implementation and cancellation. First, a total of 10 independent variables and one dependent variable were used to develop the optimal model for flight implementation according to weather condition. Second, optimal flight prediction models were derived using algorithms such as logistics regression, Adaboost, KNN, Random forest and LightGBM, which are data mining techniques. Third, we collected the opinions of military aircraft pilots who have more than 25 years experience and evaluated importance level about independent variables using Python heatmap to develop flight implementation and cancellation rules according to weather conditions. Finally, the decision tree model was constructed, and the flight rules were derived to see how the weather conditions at each airport affect the implementation and cancellation of the flight.Findings Based on historical flight information of military aircraft and weather information of flight zone. We developed flight prediction model using data mining techniques. As a result of optimal flight prediction model development for each airbase, it was confirmed that the LightGBM algorithm had the best prediction rate in terms of recall rate. Each flight rules were checked according to the weather condition, and it was confirmed that precipitation, humidity, and the total cloud had a significant effect on flight cancellation. Whereas, the effect of visibility was found to be relatively insignificant. When a flight schedule was established, the rules will provide some insight to decide flight training more systematically and effectively."

We developed a ML based model to predict survival of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) using data from two independent datasets.Materials and Methods A total of 364,316 and 1,572 CRC patients were included from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and a Korean dataset, respectively. As SEER combines data from 18 cancer registries, internal validation was done using 18-Fold-Cross-Validation then external validation was performed by testing the trained model on the Korean dataset. Performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity and positive predictive values.Results Clinicopathological characteristics were significantly different between the two datasets and the SEER showed a significant lower 5-year survival rate compared to the Korean dataset (60.1% vs. 75.3%, p < 0.001). The ML-based model using the Light gradient boosting algorithm achieved a better performance in predicting 5-year-survival compared to American Joint Committee on Cancer stage (AUROC, 0.804 vs. 0.736; p < 0.001). The most important features which influenced model performance were age, number of examined lymph nodes, and tumor size. Sensitivity and positive predictive values of predicting 5-year-survival for classes including dead or alive were reported as 68.14%, 77.51% and 49.88%, 88.1% respectively in the validation set.

From our benchmark, DimeNet++ was identified as the most accurate model to predict electronic transition properties. The average root mean square error of DimeNet++ for predicting the HOMO–LUMO gap was 0.11 eV whereas those of the other methods exceeded 0.3 eV. D-MPNN predicted fastest without sacrificing accuracy. Our results show that DimeNet++ and D-MPNN may serve as helpful evaluators for novel fluorophore design when combined with molecular generation methods."

Failure Mode Detection of Reinforced Concrete Shear Walls Using Ensemble Deep Neural Networks,2022,"['deep neural network', 'failure mode', 'shear wall', 'classification']",,"Reinforced concrete structural walls (RCSWs) are one of the most efficient lateral force-resisting systems used in buildings, providing sufficient strength, stiffness, and deformation capacities to withstand the forces generated during earthquake ground motions. Identifying the failure mode of the RCSWs is a critical task that can assist engineers and designers in choosing appropriate retrofitting solutions. This study evaluates the efficiency of three ensemble deep neural network models, including the model averaging ensemble, weighted average ensemble, and integrated stacking ensemble for predicting the failure mode of the RCSWs. The ensemble deep neural network models are compared against previous studies that used traditional well-known ensemble models (AdaBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) and traditional machine learning methods (Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest). The weighted average ensemble model is proposed as the best-suited prediction model for identifying the failure mode since it has the highest accuracy, precision, and recall among the alternative models.

Due to shorter training time, ML methods have been studied as a complementary technique to physics-based hydraulic model. Many studies on salinity prediction based on machine learning have been studied actively around the world, but there are few studies in South Korea. With a massive number of datasets available publicly, we evaluated the performance of various kinds of machine learning techniques that predict the salinity of the Nakdong River Estuary Basin. As a result, LightGBM algorithm shows average 0.37 in RMSE as prediction performance and 2-20 times faster learning speed than other algorithms.

Consumers who consume emotionally have a high score on the happiness index and satisfaction. Among them, consumers pursue a style that suits their lifestyle in the residential space where they live. And in detail, consumers are highly satisfied by changing the color and material of objects placed in the space. Consumers prefer the natural and the modern styles from among the styles of interior design. Furthermore, when consumers plan the color scheme of residential spaces, living rooms are the top priority among residential spaces. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to develop a model based on machine learning that recommends colors of furniture or objects to be placed in the living room of consumers. The data learned in the developed model is RGB of three colors extracted from natural and modern living room images. The living room space images are collected based on keywords on the I.R.I image scale, which visually measures Koreans' color sensitivity, and in addition, the living room space images are collected through a sharing platform. The collected images are cleaned and integrated using the I.R.I color image scale and CNN model. The color data (RGB) of the cleaned images are learned in XGBoost and LightGBM, which perform machine learning tasks. The color recommendation models in this paper are evaluated using r² and MSE, which are evaluation methods for regression models supported by Scikit-Learn. And the model with the highest evaluation score is selected. Therefore, in this paper, a color scheme model for color harmony in the living room was selected as XGBoost No. 2 “train : value = 8 : 2”. This is effective as a color scheme model, and it will be a model that can satisfy consumers with individuality in the era of emotional design."
