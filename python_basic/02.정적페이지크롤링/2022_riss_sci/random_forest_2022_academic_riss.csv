Random Forest를 결정로직으로 활용한 로봇의 실시간 음향인식 시스템 개발,2022,"['Sound Event Detection', 'Deep Learning', 'Robot Implementation', 'Audio Signal Processing', 'Machine Learning', 'Real-Time Implementation']",,"In this paper, we propose a robot sound recognition system that detects various sound events. The proposed system is designed to detect various sound events in real-time by using a microphone on a robot. To get real-time performance, we use a VGG11 model which includes several convolutional neural networks with real-time normalization scheme. The VGG11 model is trained on augmented DB through 24 kinds of various environments (12 reverberation times and 2 signal to noise ratios). Additionally, based on random forest algorithm, a decision logic is also designed to generate event signals for robot applications. This logic can be used for specific classes of acoustic events with better performance than just using outputs of network model. With some experimental results, the performance of proposed sound recognition system is shown on real-time device for robots."
범죄자 프로파일링을 위한 성적살인 연구: 랜덤포레스트(Random Forest)를 활용하여,2022,"['성적살인', '랜덤포레스트', '머신러닝', '살인범죄', '범죄 예측', 'Sexual homicide', 'Random Forest', 'Machine Learning', 'Homicide', 'Crime Perdicton 투고일 : 2월 27일 / 심사일 : 3월 23일 / 게재확정일 : 3월 23일']",,"Current study is conducted to explore characteristic of sexual homicide in Korea, and to present model which shows best explanation about sexual homicide. Current study uses random forest analysis that is a one of method by machine learning technic to solve methodological problem of preceding studies, and logistic regression to present predicting direction of variables. Current study inputs variables related with offender, victim, and crime scene behaviors. Result in study, our model has moderate level of predicting indicator somewhat, this predictor will be greater by adding cases and information. Relationship with offender and victim(non relationship) is the best predicting variable, and the lowest is location of body discover. Result in regression, offender’s sex(men) and marriage status(single) predict sexual homicide positively, and education level predicts sexual homicide negatively. When offender did not have relationship with victim, overkill predicts sexual homicide negatively. Current study has some implications in terms of exploring sexual homicide model to help crime investigation and offender profiling. Also we expect that current study can expand study of sexual homicide in Korea. Current study has academical implication in terms of application for machine learning technic to analysis of sexual homicide."
Multi-Step-Ahead Forecasting of the CBOE  Volatility Index in a Data-Rich Environment:  Application of Random Forest with  Boruta Algorithm,2022,"['Random Forest', 'Boruta Algorithm', 'Machine Learning', 'VIX Index', 'Volatility Forecasting', '랜덤 포레스트', '보루타 연산', '기계학습', 'VIX 지수', '변동성 예측']",,"The CBOE volatility index (VIX) is a representative barometer of the overall sentiment and volatility of the financial market. This paper seeks to apply random forest and its variable importance measure to forecasting the VIX index. Compared to the previous literature which has found it difficult to outperform the pure HAR process in terms of forecasting the VIX index due to its persistent nature, random forest can produce forecasts that are significantly more accurate than the HAR and augmented HAR models for multi- days forecasting horizons. This paper shows that the forecasting accuracy of random forest could be further improved by systematically selecting the optimal number of the most important covariates from a dataset of 298 macro-finance variables, while using the Boruta algorithm which ranks the variables based on random forest’s variable importance measure. The superior predictability of this method is more evident with longer forecasting horizons."
How many trees in a random forest?,2022,"['Binary classification', 'diagnostic statistics', 'measure of disagreement', 'number of trees', 'random forest.']",,We propose diagnostic statistics which might assist in choosing the size of a random forest for classification. We use these statistics sequentially as we construct the forest. The statistics are computed from out-of-bag or test set votes and give an estimate of expected disagreement between the current and infinite forests. Simulation studies are provided to illustrate the performance of these statistics and to compare them with other methods for choosing the size of a random forest.
A Predictive Model for Farmland Purchase/Rent Using Random Forests,2022,"['Random Forests', 'Farmland acquisition', 'Farm household economic characteristics', 'data-driven variable selection']",,"This study contributes to guidance for understanding farmland purchase and rent decisions in Korea via an analysis using a machine learning tool, Random Forests: A Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm. Farm Household Economy Survey is employed to predict the relationship between farmland acquisition and farm household economic characteristics. Our main findings are two folds. First, a farmland purchase decision is positively related to transfer incomes, the value of inventory & fixed assets, and the value of farmland that farmers owned. Second, a farmland rent decision is also positively associated with a rent paid in a prior year, revenue from field crops, inventory and agricultural assets, and transfer incomes."
A random forest-regression-based inverse-modeling evolutionary algorithm using uniform reference points,2022,"['inverse modeling', 'many-objective optimization', 'model-based evolutionary algorithm', 'random forest regression', 'uniform reference points']",,"The model-based evolutionary algorithms are divided into three groups: estimation of distribution algorithms, inverse modeling, and surrogate modeling. Existing inverse modeling is mainly applied to solve multi-objective optimization problems and is not suitable for many-objective optimization problems. Some inversed-model techniques, such as the inversed-model of multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, constructed from the Pareto front (PF) to the Pareto solution on nondominated solutions using a random grouping method and Gaussian process, were introduced. However, some of the most efficient inverse models might be eliminated during this procedure. Also, there are challenges, such as the presence of many local PFs and developing poor solutions when the population has no evident regularity. This paper proposes inverse modeling using random forest regression and uniform reference points that map all nondominated solutions from the objective space to the decision space to solve many-objective optimization problems. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using the benchmark test suite for evolutionary algorithms. The results show an improvement in diversity and convergence performance (quality indicators)."
Classification Model and Crime Occurrence City Forecasting Based on Random Forest Algorithm,2022,"['Random Forest Algorithm', 'Crime Rates', 'CCTV', 'Machine Learning Model']",,"Korea has relatively less crime than other countries. However, the crime rate is steadily increasing. Many people think the crime rate is decreasing, but the crime arrest rate has increased. The goal is to check the relationship between CCTV and the crime rate as a way to lower the crime rate, and to identify the correlation between areas without CCTV and areas without CCTV. If you see a crime that can happen at any time, I think you should use a random forest algorithm. We also plan to use machine learning random forest algorithms to reduce the risk of overfitting, reduce the required training time, and verify high-level accuracy. The goal is to identify the relationship between CCTV and crime occurrence by creating a crime prevention algorithm using machine learning random forest techniques. Assuming that no crime occurs without CCTV, it compares the crime rate between the areas where the most crimes occur and the areas where there are no crimes, and predicts areas where there are many crimes. The impact of CCTV on crime prevention and arrest can be interpreted as a comprehensive effect in part, and the purpose is to identify areas and frequency of frequent crimes by comparing the time and time without CCTV."
Performance of Random Forest Classifier for Flood Mapping Using Sentinel-1 SAR Images,2022,"['Classification', 'Random forest', 'Flood', 'Disaster', 'SAR', 'Sentinel-1']",,"The city of Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, was heavily damaged by the flood of the Nile in 2020. Classification using satellite images can define the damaged area and help emergency response. As Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) uses microwave that can penetrate cloud, it is suitable to use in the flood study. In this study, Random Forest classifier, one of the supervised classification algorithms, was applied to the flood event in Khartoum with various sizes of the training dataset and number of images using Sentinel-1 SAR. To create a training dataset, we used unsupervised classification and visual inspection. Firstly, Random Forest was performed by reducing the size of each class of the training dataset, but no notable difference was found. Next, we performed Random Forest with various number of images. Accuracy became better as the number of images increased, but converged to a maximum value when the dataset covers the duration from flood to the completion of drainage."
A Fault Diagnosis Method of Oil-Immersed Transformer Based on Improved Harris Hawks Optimized Random Forest,2022,"['Improved Harris Hawks optimization algorithm', 'Dissolved gas analysis', 'Oil-immersed transformer', 'Fault diagnosis', 'Random forest']",,"In order to improve the accuracy and reliability of fault diagnosis for oil-immersed transformers, a fault diagnosis method for oil-immersed transformers based on improved Harris Hawks optimized random forest is proposed in this paper. First, logistic chaotic mapping is used to adjust the key parameters of the algorithm; then a nonlinear energy factor adjustment strategy is used to control the algorithm to transition from global search to local search; fi nally, the method of Gaussian mutation is introduced to strengthen the local search ability, and when the algorithm is stagnant, fi refl y perturbation is performed on the optimal solution to make the algorithm jump out of local optimum. The number of n_trees and n_layers of the random forest are jointly optimized by the improved Harris Hawks optimization algorithm, and the fault diagnosis model of oil-immersed transformer is established. The noncoded ratios of dissolved characteristic gases in oil are used as the characteristic input of the diagnosis model to obtain the fi nal diagnosis results. Compared with other models and verifi ed by examples, the results show that the proposed method has the advantage of high diagnostic accuracy and has certain practical engineering application value."
Prediction of Soil Organic Carbon Contents of Rice Paddies in South-Western Coastal Area of Korea Using Random Forest Models,2022,"['Random forest', 'Reclaimed tideland soils', 'Soil organic carbon', 'Soil properties']",,"Random forest models (RFM) are useful in predicting the soil carbon (C) contents because RFM predicts soilC with high accuracy under complicated environmental conditions. However, there are very few studies onprediction of soil C using RFM in Korea. Moreover, there is no case study using RFM to predict soil C contentof reclaimed tideland (RTL) soils, which have high C sequestration capacity. Therefore, in this study, theapplicability of RFM was evaluated using published soil properties data, including soil C and soil variables,for RTL soils located in southwestern coastal areas of Korea. In the present study, RFM was built using thedata of 16 variables (e.g., sand, silt, and clay contents, pH, electrical conductivity of saturated soil paste (ECe),and nutrient concentrations) obtained from five RTLs with similar climate, topography, and vegetation. The80% of the total data were trained to build the model, and searched optimal hyper parameters were used toimprove accuracy. The determination coefficient (R2) of the model was 0.67, and the difference betweenmeasured and predicted soil C content was 25.9% on average. However, when the measured values were outof the range of the data trained for building the model or the measured values were close to the minimum ormaximum value, the difference between the predicted and measured values became larger (73.9%). Thecontribution of the independent variables to the prediction of soil C using the model was the greatest (14.9%)for soil NH4+concentrations. Meanwhile, the contribution of ECe, which was highly correlated with soil Ccontent, was not detected, suggesting that the importance of the number and range of training data used tobuild model. Our study shows the possible application of RFM to predict soil C contents of RTL soils inKorea, and further highlights that a large amount of data should be accumulated for high accuracy predictionof soil C using RFM."
Random Forest Classifier-based Ship Type Prediction with Limited Ship Information of AIS and V-Pass,2022,"['Ship type', 'Classification', 'Random forest', 'Decision tree', 'Machine learning', 'AIS', 'V-Pass']",,"Identifying ship types is an important process to prevent illegal activities on territorial waters and assess marine traffic of Vessel Traffic Services Officer (VTSO). However, the TerrestrialAutomatic Identification System (T-AIS) collected at the ground station has over 50% of vessels that do not contain the ship type information. Therefore, this study proposes a method of identifying ship types through the Random Forest Classifier (RFC) from dynamic and static data of AIS and V-Pass for one year and the Ulsan waters. With the hypothesis that six features, the speed, course, length, breadth, time, and location, enable to estimate of the ship type, four classification models were generated depending on length or breadth information since 81.9% of ships fully contain the two information. The accuracy were average 96.4% and 77.4% in the presence and absence of size information. The result shows that the proposed method is adaptable to identifying ship types."
Mapping the Mangrove Forest Restoration Potential and Conservation Gaps in China Based on Random Forest Model,2022,"['data mining method', 'mangrove habitat suitability', 'predicted probability distribution', 'restoration plan']",,"Background and objective: The area of mangroves is gradually decreasing globally, and mangroves are already one of the most threatened ecosystems. Despite net growth in the mangrove areas in China, the restoration potential of mangroves is still insufficient. This study proposed the Random forest model as an excellent data mining method to map the restoration potential based on the predicted probability of mangrove habitat suitability.Methods: We demonstrated the vital environmental variables influencing habitat suitability. The de-cisive advantages of RFM were parsimonious (variables selection), cost-effective (us-ing existing open-source data), accurate (training AUC was 0.89, testing AUC was 0.91), highly efficient (fast-training speed); and its results had high explanatory power. Here, we first mapped the conservation gaps using the RFM.Results: The results showed that temperature was the most important environmental factor influencing the habitat suit-ability of mangroves.The northern limit of suitable areas was around 24°44' N. The theoretical suitable habitat area for mangrove was 196,566.6 ha (the highly suitable area was 32,551.4 ha, the medium suitable area was 164,015.2 ha). The potential area for mangrove restoration was 176,264 ha (Guangdong with 104215.4 ha, Guangxi with 65957.5 ha).Conclusion: We proposed 24 sites with conservation gaps for mangrove forests restoration and nine potential sites as examples for the further restoration plan. We took one example site with high restoration potential for further explanation: how the key environmental factors influence the habitat suitability and how to use the infor-mation to guide the restoration strategies. RFM can be used as a data mining algo-rithm for the utmost use of the presence-only ecological data, objectively evaluating the suitability of species distribution, and providing scientifically technical data for species restoration planning."
Intrusion Detection Technique in Wireless Sensor Network using Grid Search Random Forest with Boruta Feature Selection Algorithm,2022,"['Boruta feature selection', 'grid search random forest', 'intrusion detection system (IDS)', 'machine learning (ML)', 'wireless sensor networks (WSNs).']",,"Attacks in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) aimto prevent or eradicate the network’s ability to perform itsanticipated functions. Intrusion detection is a defense used inwireless sensor networks that can detect unknown attacks. Dueto the incredible development in computer-related applicationsand massive Internet usage, it is indispensable to provide host andnetwork security. The development of hacking technology triesto compromise computer security through intrusion. Intrusiondetection system (IDS) was employed with the help of machinelearning (ML) Algorithms to detect intrusions in the network.Classic ML algorithms like support vector machine (SVM), Knearestneighbour (KNN), and filter-based feature selection oftenled to poor accuracy and misclassification of intrusions. Thisarticle proposes a novel framework for IDS that can be enabledby Boruta feature selection with grid search random forest (BFSGSRF)algorithm to overcome these issues. The performanceof BFS-GSRF is compared with ML algorithms like lineardiscriminant analysis (LDA) and classification and regression tree(CART) etc. The proposed work was implemented and tested onnetwork security laboratory – knowledge on discovery dataset(NSL-KDD). The experimental results show that the proposedmodel BFS-GSRF yields higher accuracy (i.e., 99%) in detectingattacks, and it is superior to LDA, CART, and other existingalgorithms."
Prediction of TC11 single-track geometry in laser metal deposition based on back propagation neural network and random forest,2022,"['Laser metal deposition', 'Neural network', 'Random forest', 'Geometry characteristics']",,"Laser metal deposition process usually involves the nonlinear interaction of multiple factors, such as process parameters and ambient temperature. In this study, random forest (RF) and multilayer back propagation neural network (BPNN) algorithms were employed to investigate the coupling relationship between process parameters and single-track geometry in laser metal deposition for TC11 alloy. With laser power, scanning speed, and powder feeding rate as inputs and track width and height as outputs, 30 different groups of experimental results were adopted as training groups. Their geometries were also predicted. The maximum relative errors of track width and height predictions based on BPNN model were 0.007 % and 0.029 %, respectively, which were lower than those based on RF model. Then, the two models were used to predict the geometry under four new sets of process parameters. Experimental results showed that the maximum error of BPNN model is lower than that of RF model. BPNN model also showed potential to improve cladding quality and efficiency."
Determination of the Critical Slip Surface of Slope Based on the Improved Quantum Genetic Algorithm and Random Forest,2022,"['Critical slip surface', 'Quantum genetic algorithm (QGA)', 'Random forest (RF)', 'Safety factor (Fs)']",,"Intelligent optimization algorithms are widely used to determine the critical slip surface of slopes. However, the critical slip surface may not converge to a proper solution because of the nonconvex and discontinuous nature of the objective function. An intelligent optimization algorithm is developed by combining the improved quantum genetic algorithm (QGA) and random forest (RF) regression method to identify the critical slip surface of the slope. A dynamic adjustment strategy is used to control the update and evolution direction of the population to obtain the global optimal solution, which not only ensures the convergence of the results but also effectively avoids premature convergence. The RF regression method is applied to estimate the fitness, which can help avoid the mechanical analysis of the slide body of the slope and increase the calculation efficiency. An external penalty function is used to penalize solutions that do not meet the constraints of the slip surface. This aspect reduces probability of such solutions appearing in the next generation, thereby ensuring that the identified critical slip surface has practical significance. The results obtained for four slope cases are in agreement with those of previous investigations, which demonstrates the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, the results of the four slope cases show that the convergence speed is higher for a larger population."
Feature Extraction of Non-proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy Using Faster R-CNN and Automatic Severity Classification System Using Random Forest Method,2022,"['Faster R-CNN', 'Classification', 'Machine Learning', 'Non-proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Random Forest']",,"Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy is a representative complication of diabetic patients and is known to bea major cause of impaired vision and blindness. There has been ongoing research on automatic detection ofdiabetic retinopathy, however, there is also a growing need for research on an automatic severity classificationsystem. This study proposes an automatic detection system for pathological symptoms of diabetic retinopathysuch as microaneurysms, retinal hemorrhage, and hard exudate by applying the Faster R-CNN technique. Anautomatic severity classification system was devised by training and testing a Random Forest classifier basedon the data obtained through preprocessing of detected features. An experiment of classifying 228 test fundusimages with the proposed classification system showed 97.8% accuracy."
Machine-Learning for Prescription Patterns: Random Forest in the Prediction of Dose and Number of Antipsychotics Prescribed to People with Schizophrenia,2022,"['Schizophrenia', 'Antipsychotic drugs', 'Drug prescription', 'Drug polytherapy', 'Machine learning.']",,"Objective: We aimed to predict antipsychotic prescription patterns for people with schizophrenia using machine learning (ML) algorithms.Methods: In a cross-sectional design, a sample of community mental health service users (SUs; n = 368) with a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia was randomly selected. Socio-demographic and clinical features, including the number, total dose, and route of administration of the antipsychotic treatment were recorded. Information about the number and the length of psychiatric hospitalization was retrieved. Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression and ML algorithms (i.e., random forest [RF], supported vector machine, K-nearest neighborhood, and Naïve Bayes) were used to estimate the predictors of total antipsychotic dosage and prescription of antipsychotic polytherapy (APP).Results: The strongest predictor of the total dose was APP. The number of Community Mental Health Centers (CMHC) contacts was the most important predictor of APP and, with APP omitted, of dosage. Treatment with anticholinergics predicted APP, emphasizing the strong correlation between APP and higher antipsychotic dose. RF performed better than OLS regression and the other ML algorithms in predicting both antipsychotic dose (root square mean error = 0.70, R2 = 0.31) and APP (area under the receiving operator curve = 0.66, true positive rate = 0.41, and true negative rate = 0.78).Conclusion: APP is associated with the prescription of higher total doses of antipsychotics. Frequent attenders at CMHCs, and SUs recently hospitalized are often treated with APP and higher doses of antipsychotics. Future prospective studies incorporating standardized clinical assessments for both psychopathological severity and treatment efficacy are needed to confirm these findings."
What Makes Sports Clubs Successful at Recruiting and Retaining Members from the Perspective of Managers? Results from a Random Forest Analysis,2022,"['Customer relationshipmanagement', 'openinnovation', 'coopetition', 'organizational capacity', 'nonprofit organizations', '客户关系管理；开放式创新；合作性竞争；组织能力；非营利组织']",,"The goal of this study is to investigate the relative importance of several predictors of nonprofit sports clubs’ success in recruiting new, and keeping existing, members from the perspective of club managers. Using a random forest analysis known from machine learning, the study takes into account relevant predictors of successful member recruitment and retention. Data were collected via a survey with managers from 284 German sports clubs. The results reveal that service quality and trust are the two most important predictors for recruiting and retaining members. Furthermore, innovation activity, among others, has positive effects on recruiting and retaining members. It also provides suggestive evidence for adverse effects of coopetition—that is, the collaboration with competitors—because high-level (vs. medium-level) collaboration with the clubs’ competitors had a negative impact on recruiting and retaining members. The study derives several implications for the customer relationship management in nonprofit sports clubs."
Determination of Survival of Gastric Cancer Patients With Distant Lymph Node Metastasis Using Prealbumin Level and Prothrombin Time: Contour Plots Based on Random Survival Forest Algorithm on High-Dimensionality Clinical and Laboratory Datasets,2022,"['Stomach neoplasms', 'Lymphatic metastasis', 'Survival analysis', 'Supervised machine learning']",,"Purpose: This study aimed to identify prognostic factors for patients with distant lymph node-involved gastric cancer (GC) using a machine learning algorithm, a method that offers considerable advantages and new prospects for high-dimensional biomedical data exploration. Materials and Methods: This study employed 79 features of clinical pathology, laboratory tests, and therapeutic details from 289 GC patients whose distant lymphadenopathy was presented as the first episode of recurrence or metastasis. Outcomes were measured as any-cause death events and survival months after distant lymph node metastasis. A prediction model was built based on possible outcome predictors using a random survival forest algorithm and confirmed by 5×5 nested cross-validation. The effects of single variables were interpreted using partial dependence plots. A contour plot was used to visually represent survival prediction based on 2 predictive features. Results: The median survival time of patients with GC with distant nodal metastasis was 9.2 months. The optimal model incorporated the prealbumin level and the prothrombin time (PT), and yielded a prediction error of 0.353. The inclusion of other variables resulted in poorer model performance. Patients with higher serum prealbumin levels or shorter PTs had a significantly better prognosis. The predicted one-year survival rate was stratified and illustrated as a contour plot based on the combined effect the prealbumin level and the PT. Conclusions: Machine learning is useful for identifying the important determinants of cancer survival using high-dimensional datasets. The prealbumin level and the PT on distant lymph node metastasis are the 2 most crucial factors in predicting the subsequent survival time of advanced GC."
"Analysis of Composition and Diversity of Natural Regeneration of Woody Species in Jebel El Gerrie Dry Land Forest East of Blue Nile State, Sudan",2022,"['Sudan', 'natural regeneration', 'diversity', 'dry land forest']",,"The study aims to assess composition, diversity and population indices of natural regeneration of woody species in Jebel El Gerrie forest reserve, Blue Nile State, Sudan. We conducted field work between December 2018 and January 2019. We used random sampling to collect vegetation data in the forest where we made a total of 90 circular sample plots (radius 17.84 m) and distributed them proportionally to the area of each of the four density-based vegetation classes of the forest i.e. high density (C1), medium density (C2), low density (C3) and crop land (C4). In each sample plot we identified all regenerating tree species and counted their regeneration frequencies. We calculated ecological metrics of regeneration frequency, density, abundance, richness, evenness, diversity and importance value index (IVI) and drew abundance rank curve. Results revealed that out of fifteen mature tree species present, natural regeneration of 8 species, which belong to 6 families, was observed. The relatively most frequently naturally regenerating and abundant species were Anogeissus leiocarpa and Combretum hartmannianum. Richness, evenness and diversity of regenerating species were 1.33, 0.82 and 1.7, respectively. One-way ANOVA (α=0.05) of mean regeneration densities disclosed that there were significant differences (F<sub>3,86</sub>=16.77, p=0.000) between C2 & C3 (p=0.000) and C2 & C4 (p=0.000). While regeneration of seven tree species were absent, two, two and four species were of good, poor and fair regeneration status, respectively. A comparison of mean density of natural regeneration with that of parent trees reflects a poor regeneration status of the forest. The study provides empirical results on the regeneration status of species and signifies the need for management interventions for species conservation and restoration, maintenance of biodiversity and sustainable production."
Forest vegetation structure of Bogd Khan Mountain: A Strictly Protected Area in Mongolia,2022,"['Biological spectrum', 'Diameter at breast height', 'Diversity value', 'Importance value', 'Plant community']",,"Bogd Khan Mountain is a strictly protected area located in the Khentei mountain range. It lies in the transitional zone of the Siberian coniferous taiga and the Asian steppe and has a unique ecosystem. The present study was conducted with the objective of identifying the plant community type, forest structure, and the changes in forest stands of the Bogd Khan Mountain. Sampling was done at 155 plots randomly along the gradients of the entire forest. Differences in species composition, biological spectrum, species diversity, and importance value were analyzed in each community. This study revealed the occurrence of six plant community types comparing of Larix sibirica, Picea obovata, Pinus sibirica, Betula pendula subsp. mandshurica, Pinus sylvestris and Populus tremula. These communities were different in species richness, diversity, and their distribution correlated to the altitudinal gradient (score 0.71735; p value 0.001). An upsurge in Picea obovata, and Betula pendula subsp. mandshurica community was found, indicating changes in the ecosystem such as permafrost melting, caused by anthropogenic influences. We suggest preserving the main dominant tree species in the native communities and reduction of the anthropogenic impacts urgently for the effective management of the biodiversity of the Bogd Khan Mountain."
Natural Regeneration Potential of the Soil Seed Bank of Land Use Types in Ecosystems of Ogun River Watershed,2022,"['land use types', 'soil seed bank', 'degradation', 'emergence', 'management']",,"Soil seed banks as natural storage of plant seeds play an important role in the maintenance and regeneration of watershed. Natural regeneration potential of the soil seed bank of Land use types (LUTs) in Ogun River watershed (ORW) was investigated. ORW was stratified using proportionate sampling technique into Guinea Savannah (GS), Rainforest (RF) and Swamp Forest (SF) Ecological Zones (EZs). Three LUTs: Natural Forest (NF), Disturbed Forest (DF) and Farmland (FL) were purposively selected in GS: GSNF, GSDF, GSFL; RF: RFNF, RFDF, RFFL and SF: SFNF, SFDF, SFFL, respectively. Systematic line transects was used in the laying of the sample plots. Sample plots of 25 m×25 m were established in alternate positions. Ten 1 m×1 m quadrats were randomly laid for soil core sampling from previously randomly selected ten plots. The core samples (10) were pooled per plot in each LUT and placed in individual trays. Ten trays with sterilized soil were used as control. The trays were watered regularly and checked for seedlings emergence fortnightly for 18 months. The experimental design used was 3×3 factorial experiments. ANOVA, Diversity index (H') and Similarity index (SI) were used to analyze the data. There was significant difference in seedling emergence among ecological zones and land use types (p<0.05). A total of 4,400 seedlings emerged from the soil samples. All species were distributed among 32 families. FL in the RF had the highest number of germinated seeds (705±37.33 seedlings) followed by DF in the RF (701±49.6 seedlings). The lowest emergence was in NF of the SF (199±28.41 seedlings). DF in the RF had highest number of species (34) distributed among 22 families. Emergence from soil seed bank of NF in ORW was generally with more of tree species than herbs that were predominant in FL and DF."
Pattern of Sexual Dimorphism in Garcinia kola (Heckel) Plantation,2022,"['pistillode', 'invariant-female', 'gynodioecy', 'inconstant-male', 'staminode']",,"A study was designed to investigate the pattern of sexual dimorphism in a plantation of Garcinia kola. Twenty trees were randomly selected for the study and have been observed to flower regularly. A total of 100 inflorescence were randomly collected from the crown of each tree and 500 flowers randomly assessed within the period of four (4) flowering seasons. Floral sex assessment was done visually and with a hand magnifying lens; floral morphometric measurements (i.e. pedicel and perianth length and breadth), inflorescence length, and breadth) was taken using a veneer caliper; number of flowers per inflorescence and inflorescence per twig was counted; while, data analysis was conducted on excel using analysis of variance and pairwise t-test comparison. Four floral sexes were identified in the G. kola plantation studied which were unisexual male flowers, unisexual female flowers, cosexual unisexual male flowers, and cosexual hermaphrodite flowers. Three tree sexes were identified viz: inconstant male, invariant female, and cosexual trees. The plantation was significantly sexually dimorphic in floral sex and phenotypic traits (i.e. pedicel and perianth size), and as well as sexually dimorphic in tree sex and reproductive phenotypic traits (i.e. inflorescence size, number of inflorescences per twig, and number of flower bud per inflorescence). The sexual system of the plantation was therefore trioecious with features suggestive of evolving dioecy through the gynodioecious pathway."
Effect of arbuscular mycorrhiza on germination and initial growth ofCinchona officinalisL. (Rubiaceae),2022,"['Arbuscular mycorrhiza', 'cinchona tree', 'forestnursery', 'forest seedlings', 'seed propagation']",,"Cinchona officinalis, known locally as cascarilla or cinchona, is a plant species native to SouthAmerica. It was used as a source of quinine to combat malaria in the 17th century. The spe-cies is threatened by various anthropogenic activities. Further, the propagation of the spe-cies depends on seed dispersal and its germination capacity. Therefore, it is necessary toconserve and propagate this species. BecauseC. officinalisseeds have a low germinationcapacity, we determined the effect of arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) on their germination andgrowth. A randomized design was employed with two treatments, one treated with mycor-rhizae (CM) and another without mycorrhizae (SM). For each treatment, three replicates of100 seeds were used. Germination, growth, and fungal characteristics were evaluated. In ger-mination parameters, the CM treatment showed better performance, but the improvementwas statistically insignificant. However, the application of AM significantly improved seedlingheight (cm), root length (cm), leaf area (cm2), and root number by 53.52, 28.72, 29.73, and61.66%, respectively. Likewise, mycorrhization intensity (%), mycorrhization frequency (%),and extraradical mycelium length (cm) in the CM treatment were 37.13, 3.44, and 174.97%higher compared to the SM treatment, respectively. Therefore, the use of AM fungi provesto be advantageous in the propagation ofC. officinalis, and these results provide a basis forthe largescale and sustainable propagation of this species."
Effect of Urban Parks on Carbon and PM2.5 Reduction in Gangneung,2022,"['offset', 'GET (green evaluation technique)', 'uptake', 'land cover types', 'climate change']",,"Increasing carbon and PM2.5 concentrations have been emerging as serious environmental issues worldwide. The purpose of this study was to quantify carbon and PM2.5 reduction by urban parks in Gangneung, Korea. A total of 35 parks were sampled by applying a random sampling method to survey tree planting structures and the areal distribution of land cover types of urban parks. These survey data and the Green Evaluation Technique (GET) computer program were used to estimate carbon and PM2.5 reduction by trees. Mean tree density and cover in the study parks were 3.5±0.2 tree/100 m2 and 44.5±3.0%, respectively. Annual carbon uptake and PM2.5 deposition per unit area by trees averaged 2.8±0.2 t/ha/yr and 30.2±2.8 kg/ha/yr. Gangneung’s urban parks annually offset the carbon emissions by 3.4% and the PM2.5 emissions by 3.5%. Thus, urban parks played a significant role in reducing atmospheric carbon and PM2.5 concentrations. Total annual carbon uptake and PM2.5 deposition of urban parks in Gangneung were about 1,338.2 t/yr and 14,433.2 kg/yr.

In this study, the possibility for cryopreservation of embryogenic cells of Siberian ginseng (Eleutherococcus senticosus) in liquid nitrogen (-196℃) was evaluated. The effects of glycerol and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at different concentrations (5%, 10% and 20%) as cryoprotectants on regrowth of cryopreserved E. senticosus embryogenic cells were tested. There was significant effect of cryoprotectants on regrowth of embryogenic cells (p=0.0019). The highest and lowest fresh mass gain were achieved when embryogenic cells were frozen with 10% DMSO and 5% glycerol (138.2±5.9 and 61.3±14.6, respectively). The effect of the cryoprotectants on the frequency embryo germination was tested. There was no significant difference between glycerol and DMSO (p=0.846). Three different concentrations of cryoprotectants did not significantly affect the frequency embryo germination (p=0.534). Finally, the genetic fidelity of the plantlets regenerated from non-cryopreserved and cryopreserved embryogenic cells was tested by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) analysis. RAPD and ISSR analysises showed that there was no genetic variation among regenerants."
"Intercropping of Cow Pea (Vigna unguiculata) as Summer Forage Yield with Grewia tenax in Irrigated Saline Soil of Khartoum State, Sudan",2022,"['intercropping', 'G. tenax', 'cow pea', 'saline soils', 'land equivalent ratio']",,"Agroforestry in terms of intercropping cow pea as summer forage with Grewia tenax was undertaken under sub -irrigation system in two consecutive seasons of 2017 and 2018 in saline soil of Khartoum State of Sudan. The aims were to find out suitable agro forestry system for saline soils as well as to investigate effect of tree spacing on field summer forage crop under semi -irrigation system. Therefore G. tenax trees that spaced at 4×4 m were used as main factor versus cow pea crop that incorporated at 25×50 cm intervals by using completely randomized block design with 3 replications. Trees and crop parameters were determined in terms of plant growth and yield. In addition to land equivalent ratio and soil chemical and physical properties at different layers were determined. The results revealed that, soil parameters in terms of CaCo₃, SAR, ESP, pH paste and EC ds/m were increased with increasing soil depths. Meanwhile tree growth did not show any significant differences in the first season in 2017. Whereas in the second season in 2018 tree growth namely; tree height, tree collar and canopy diameters were higher under intercropping than in sole trees. Cow pea plant height recorded significant differences under sole crop in the first season in 2017. Unlike the forage fresh yield that was significant under the inter cropped plots. Tree fruit yield was higher under sole trees and land equivalent ratio was more advantageous under GS2 (1.5 m) which amounted to 4. Therefore it is possible to introduce this agroforestry system under saline soils to provide summer forage of highly nutritive value to feed animals and to increase farmers’ income as far as to halt desertification and to sequester carbon."

Considering the features of data that are difficult to apply traditional statistical techniques, this study implemented random forest algorithms to predict crime and victim characteristics using the victim’s criminal damages (psychological damage and emotional change) and selected good predictors using VSURF function in VSURF package for R. As a result of the analysis, it was confirmed that the relationship between the type of crime and depression, extreme fear, somatic symptoms, and interpersonal problems, between perpetrator acquisition and somatic symptoms and interpersonal problems, and between repeated victimization and changes in respect for Korean legal system/law. Gender and life cycle stage (youth/adult/elderly) were found to be related to extreme fear and changes in self-protection confidence, respectively.

However, since the wavelength is short, it has a high path loss and is verysensitive to the atmospheric environment. Therefore, in order to develop a W-band communication system in thefuture, it is necessary to analyze the characteristics of path loss according to the channel environment. In this paper,to analyze the characteristics of the W-band path loss, the random forest technique was used, and the influence ofthe channel parameters according to the distance section was analyzed through the path loss data according tovarious channel environment parameters. As a result of the simulation, the distance has the highest influence on thepath loss in the short distance, and the other channel environment factor is almost ignored. However, as the distancesection became longer, the influence of distance decreased while the impact of clutter and rainfall increased."

The k-nearest neighbors algorithm (kNN), which is a non-parametric learning model, and the tree-based random forest (RF) model were applied to the machine-learning algorithm, and the estimated biomasses were compared with the forest reference emission levels (FREL) data, which was provided by the Paraguayan government.The root mean square error (RMSE), which was the optimum parameter of the kNN model, was 35.9, and the RMSE of the RF model was lower at 34.41, showing that the RF model was superior. As a result of separately using the FREL, kNN, and RF methods to set the reference emission levels, the gradient was set to approximately -33,000 tons, -253,000 tons, and -92,000 tons, respectively. These results showed that the machine learning-based estimation model was more suitable than the existing methods for setting reference emission levels."

In this research, forecast models of forest fire risk at a mid-range (with lead times up to 7 days) scale were developed considering past, present and future conditions (i.e., forest fire risk, drought, and weather) through random forest machine learning over South Korea. The models were developed using weather forecast data from the Global Data Assessment and Prediction System, historical and current Fire Risk Index (FRI) information, and environmental factors (i.e., elevation, forest fire hazard index, and drought index). Three schemes were examined: scheme 1 using historical values of FRI and drought index, scheme 2 using historical values of FRI only, and scheme 3 using the temporal patterns of FRI and drought index. The models showed high accuracy (Pearson correlation coefficient >0.8, relative root mean square error <10%), regardless of the lead times, resulting in a good agreement with actual forest fire events. The use of the historical FRI itself as an input variable rather than the trend of the historical FRI produced more accurate results, regardless of the drought index used."

In the first stage, ATPRK-based spatial downscaling is performed to reduce the differences in spatial resolution between multi-sensor satellite images. In the second stage, regression modeling using random forest is then applied to quantify the relationship of spectral bands between multi-sensor satellite images. The prediction performance of 2SSFM was evaluated through a case study of the generation of red-edge and short-wave infrared bands. The red-edge and short-wave infrared bands of PlanetScope images were predicted from Sentinel-2 images using 2SSFM. From the case study, 2SSFM could generate red-edge and short-wave infrared bands with improved spatial resolution and similar spectral patterns to the actual spectral bands, which confirms the feasibility of 2SSFM for the generation of spectral bands not provided in high spatial resolution satellite images. Thus, 2SSFM can be applied to generate various spectral indices using the predicted spectral bands that are actually unavailable but effective for environmental monitoring."

This paper presents a two-stage cloud removal method that combines conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) with regression-based calibration to construct a cloud-free time-series optical image set. In the first stage, the cGANs generate initial prediction results using quantitative relationships between optical and synthetic aperture radar images. In the second stage, the relationships between the predicted results and the actual values in non-cloud areas are first quantified via random forest-based regression modeling and then used to calibrate the cGAN-based prediction results. The potential of the proposed method was evaluated from a cloud removal experiment using Sentinel-2 and COSMO-SkyMed images in the rice field cultivation area of Gimje. The cGAN model could effectively predict the reflectance values in the cloud-contaminated rice fields where severe changes in physical surface conditions happened. Moreover, the regression-based calibration in the second stage could improve the prediction accuracy, compared with a regression-based cloud removal method using a supplementary image that is temporally distant from the target image. These experimental results indicate that the proposed method can be effectively applied to restore cloud-contaminated areas when cloud-free optical images are unavailable for environmental monitoring."

Event-based White Blood Cell Classification from Nailfold Capillaries,2022,"['White blood cells', 'Nailfold capillary', 'Event-based data', 'Classification', 'Dynamic vision sensor']",,"Detecting absorption gaps in a nailfold capillary can be used to quantify an estimation of white blood cells (WBCs). Previously, the absorption gaps in a nailfold capillary were usually measured using a standard camera on a fingernail. However, difficulties arise due to low visibility of the gap, the small size of the capillaries, the high speed of WBC movement, and the lack of contrast between the capillary and its environment/background. To address these issues, an eventbased WBC image is utilized as input data to detect WBC existence in the nailfold. Specifically, we utilize a dynamic vision sensor (DVS) camera, which can detect a change in luminance on a pixel basis and can produce a stream of asynchronous event output at a microsecond temporal resolution.With the event-based WBC dataset, we conduct a classification task using three different machine learning algorithms: k-nearest neighbors, the decision tree, and random forest.

Regular dancing can help maintain physical function and improve the quality of life in this population. This review evaluated randomized control trials (RCTs) of the effectiveness of dance programs on the physical function of healthy older adults. Methods: We systematically searched four databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, and ThaiLis) through December 2021 for primary studies evaluating dance programs in healthy older adults aged 60 years and over. The meta-analysis used a random-effects model to compute the effect sizes using a forest plot and Cochran’s Q and I2 statistics as heterogeneity measures. Results: Eight types of dance programs showed significantly improved physical function. Muscle strength was assessed using the five times sit-to-stand test (I2=89%; p=0.003), chair-sit-to-stand-30S test (I2=75%; p=0.006), and 30-s arm curl test (I2=22%; p=0.260). Static balance was evaluated using the Berg-balance scales test (I2=0%; p=0.620) and the one-leg-stand test (I2=32%; p=0.220). Dynamic balance was tested based on the time up-and-go and eight-foot up-and-go tests (I2=51%; p=0.110). Flexibility was assessed based on the back-scratch (I2=56%; p=0.130) and sit-and-reach test (I2=0%; p=0.930). Conclusion: Dance exercise programs improved muscle strength, balance, and flexibility. Such programs are effective and safe for healthy older adults for use as daily exercise to promote health. Therefore, researchers, healthcare providers, and policymakers should establish properly organized dance interventions to improve physical function in healthy older adults."
A Design and Implement of Efficient Agricultural Product Price Prediction Model,2022,"['Agricultural Product Price forecasting', 'Machine Learning', 'Gradient Boosting Algorithm', 'DACON', '농산물 가격예측', '머신러닝']",,"In this paper, we propose an efficient agricultural products price prediction model based on dataset which provided in DACON. This model is XGBoost and CatBoost, and as an algorithm of the Gradient Boosting series, the average accuracy and execution time are superior to the existing Logistic Regression and Random Forest. Based on these advantages, we design a machine learning model that predicts prices 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks from the previous prices of agricultural products. The XGBoost model can derive the best performance by adjusting hyperparameters using the XGBoost Regressor library, which is a regression model. The implemented model is verified using the API provided by DACON, and performance evaluation is performed for each model. Because XGBoost conducts its own overfitting regulation, it derives excellent performance despite a small dataset, but it was found that the performance was lower than LGBM in terms of temporal performance such as learning time and prediction time."

Electronic search methods were used to identify 18 relevant randomized controlled trials. Meta-analyses of standardized mean difference (SMD) calculated using Hedges’ g between RT and/or PS groups versus control groups were conducted using a random-effects model. The meta-effects are presented in a forest plot with a 95% confidence interval (CI).RESULTS: The meta-analysis showed that RT significantly improved UGS (SMD, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.12-0.68; p=.006), while PS did not improve UGS (SMD, -0.17; 95% CI, -0.80 to 0.46; p=.601). A subgroup analysis indicated that there were significant increases in UGS after both ‘RT-only intervention (SMD, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.59; p=.046)’ and ‘RT combined with balance training (BT) (SMD, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.17-1.13; p=.008)’, while there was no significant increase in UGS after ‘RT combined with power training (PT) (SMD, -0.08; 95% CI, -0.62 to 0.45; p=.765)’. There was no additive effect on UGS after RT combined with PS (SMD, -0.06; 95% CI, -0.36 to 0.24; p=.699).CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that RT significantly improved UGS in postmenopausal women, and adding BT to RT further improved UGS. In addition, there was no significant improvement in UGS after PS in postmenopausal women, and no additive effect on UGS after RT combined with PS"

다종 위성자료와 인공지능 기법을 이용한 한반도 주변 해역의 고해상도 해수면온도 자료 생산,2022,"['Sea surface temperature', 'Reconstruction', 'Artificial intelligence', 'DINCAE', 'LGBM', 'Korea peninsula']",,"Although satellite-based sea surface temperature (SST) is advantageous for monitoring large areas, spatiotemporal data gaps frequently occur due to various environmental or mechanical causes. Thus, it is crucial to fill in the gaps to maximize its usability. In this study, daily SST composite fields with a resolution of 4 km were produced through a two-step machine learning approach using polar-orbiting and geostationary satellite SST data. The first step was SST reconstruction based on Data Interpolate Convolutional AutoEncoder (DINCAE) using multi-satellite-derived SST data. The second step improved the reconstructed SST targeting in situ measurements based on light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) to finally produce daily SST composite fields. The DINCAE model was validated using random masks for 50 days, whereas the LGBM model was evaluated using leave-one-year-out cross-validation (LOYOCV). The SST reconstruction accuracy was high, resulting in R<sup>2</sup> of 0.98, and a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 0.97℃. The accuracy increase by the second step was also high when compared to in situ measurements, resulting in an RMSE decrease of 0.21-0.29℃ and an MAE decrease of 0.17-0.24℃. The SST composite fields generated using all in situ data in this study were comparable with the existing data assimilated SST composite fields. In addition, the LGBM model in the second step greatly reduced the overfitting, which was reported as a limitation in the previous study that used random forest. The spatial distribution of the corrected SST was similar to those of existing high resolution SST composite fields, revealing that spatial details of oceanic phenomena such as fronts, eddies and SST gradients were well simulated. This research demonstrated the potential to produce high resolution seamless SST composite fields using multi-satellite data and artificial intelligence."
Comparing automated and non-automated machine learning for autism spectrum disorders classification using facial images,2022,"['artificial intelligence', 'autism spectrum detection', 'deep learning', 'facial images', 'machine learning']",,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder associated with cognitive and neurobehavioral disorders. It affects the person’s behavior and performance. Autism affects verbal and non-verbal communication in social interactions. Early screening and diagnosis of ASD are essential and helpful for early educational planning and treatment, the provision of family support, and for providing appropriate medical support for the child on time. Thus, developing automated methods for diagnosing ASD is becoming an essential need. Herein, we investigate using various machine learning methods to build predictive models for diagnosing ASD in children using facial images. To achieve this, we used an autistic children dataset containing 2936 facial images of children with autism and typical children. In application, we used classical machine learning methods, such as support vector machine and random forest. In addition to using deep-learning methods, we used a state-of-the-art method, that is, automated machine learning (AutoML). We compared the results obtained from the existing techniques. Consequently, we obtained that AutoML achieved the highest performance of approximately 96% accuracy via the Hyperpot and tree-based pipeline optimization tool optimization. Furthermore, AutoML methods enabled us to easily find the best parameter settings without any human efforts for feature engineering."

X선 형광분석 결과, 면산층의 평균 타이타늄 함량은 타 층들에 비해 최소 10배 이상의 타이타늄 함량을 보이며 낮은 함량군과 높은 함량군의 다봉분포를 갖는다. 이는 면산층 내의 타이타늄이 함유되는 사질과 이질이 교호 반복되는데 사질 부분은 이질 부분보다 타이타늄의 함량이 상대적으로 높기 때문이다. 분광분석 결과, 면산층은 산화철의 흡광 특성이 근적외선 영역에서, 점토광물에 의한 흡광 특성이 단파적외선 영역에서 관찰되며, 풍화면의 경우 점토광물 특성이 보다 강해지는 경향을 보인다. 타이타늄 광화대의 탐지는 티탄철석 자체의 분광 특성이 특징적이지 않아 광체를 탐지의 대상으로 보기보다는 모암인 면산층을 탐지하는 것이 적절할 것으로 생각된다. 랜덤포레스트 기계학습 기법을 이용한 면산층의 탐지 정확도는 84%, 전체정확도 97%를 보였으며, 산화철의 분광 특성과 점토광물 분광 특성이 가장 중요한 역할을 하는 것으로 분석되었다. 이는 분광 특성이 타이타늄 모암인 면산층 암석을 효율적으로 탐지할 수 있음을 지시하고, 확대 적용 될경우 무인항공기반 타이타늄 광체 탐사에 적용할 수 있을 것으로 기대한다.","This study investigated spectroscopic exploration of Myeonsan formation, the titanium(Ti) ore hostrock, in Joseon supergroup based on machine learning technique. The mineral composition, Ti concentration, spectral characteristics of Myeonsan and non-Myeonsan formation of Joseon supergroup were analyzed. The Myeonsan formation contains relatively larger quantity of opaque minerals along with quartz and clay minerals. The PXRF analysis revealed that the Ti concentration of Myeosan formation is at least 10 times larger than the other formations with bi-modal distribution. The bi-modal concentration is caused by high Ti concentrated sandy layer and relatively lower Ti concentrated muddy layer. The spectral characteristics of Myeonsan formation is manifested by Fe oxides at near infrared and clay minerals at shortwave infrared bands. The Ti exploration is expected to be more effective on detection of hostrock rather than Ti ore because ilmenite does not have characteristic spectral features. The random-forest machine learning classification detected the Myeonsan fomation at 85% accuracy with overall accuracy of 97%, where spectral features of iron oxides and clay minerals played an important role. It indicates that spectral analysis can detect the Ti host rock effectively, and can contribute for UAV based remote sensing for Ti exploration."

The partial capacity of the set charging voltage range and the remaining capacity are used as the training data for the random forest model. The training data can be used directly without any pre-processing. When the partial capacity of a specific voltage range is entered into the trained random forest model, it estimates the remaining capacity. Furthermore, the important voltage range is extracted by selecting the voltage section that is critical for estimating the remaining capacity based on the permutation importance. The mean absolute error and coefficient of determination were used to validate the important voltage range. Validation results show that the proposed model can estimate the remaining capacity with a low error. Therefore, the proposed model can be used for online battery capacity estimation using a narrow voltage range."

Therefore, this study aimed to identify the latent groups based on various delinquencies and examine latent groups’ predictors using machine learning and multidimensional approaches.Methods: Using nationally representative data (N = 8,210; male 52.17%), a latent class analysis was conducted to identify latent groups based on 10 delinquent behaviors self-reported by adolescents. A random forest analysis was then employed to predict latent groups using 53 predictors including demographic (6 items), personal (44 items), and environmental levels (3 items). The Mplus program was used for latent class analysis, and the R version 4.0.5 program was used for random forest analysis.Results: Three latent groups were identified and categorized as “high online delinquency” (3.2%), “drink/media delinquency” (26.8%), and “low delinquency” (70.0%). Random forest analysis found adolescents’ perception of harmful substances was the most important variable predicting the delinquent groups. Partial dependence plots showed the higher the interest in harmful substances, the lower the ability to respond to the harmful substances; the higher the access to harmful environment, the lower the grade; and the lower the autonomy control ability, the more likely the classification as a high delinquency group.Conclusion: This study classified three latent groups while considering the detailed types of delinquencies. The study found the prominent predictors using machine learning and multidimensional approaches to suggest useful delinquency prevention programs."

As a result, the fish community that inhabits the island's stream is isolated from the mainland and other island. This study utilized a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and a random forest model to analyze the relationship between environmental variables and fish communities inhabiting islands in South Korea. Through the SOM analysis, the fish communities were divided into three clusters, and there were differences in biotic and abiotic factors between these groups. Cluster I consisted of sites with relatively larger island areas and a higher number of species and population. It was found that 15 out of 16 indicator species were included. Meanwhile, the remaining clusters had fewer species and populations. Cluster II, especially, showed the lowest impact from physical variables such as water width and depth. As a result of predicting the species richness using the random forest model, physical variables in habitats, such as stream width and water depth, had a relatively higher importance on species richness. On the other hand, forest area was the most important variables for predicting Shannon diversity, followed by maximum water depth, and gravel. The results suggest that this study can be used as basic data for establishing a stream ecosystem management strategy in terms of conservation and protection of biological resources in streams of islands."

First, the hydraulic design characteristics of the proposed spillway were discussed using a laboratory-scaled model. Effective parameters on the energy dissipation rate were defined as the relative critical depth, Froude number, number of steps, and dimensionless steps’ geometry parameter using dimensional analysis. The energy dissipation rate of the stepped vertical overfall spillway is measured using a waterwheel laboratory setup. Different geometry and hydraulic scenarios were used to assess the energy dissipation rate variation of the proposed spillway. Furthermore, Support Vector Regression and Random Forest Regression methods were used to estimate the energy dissipation of the proposed structure. Investigating the energy dissipation rate of 27 geometry scenarios with the available range of discharge revealed that the energy dissipation rate against the water’s relative depth inside the SVO spillway follows a gradually increasing trend ranging between 88.53% to 98.06%. Also, random forest regression algorithm showed more accurate prediction performance than support vector regression approach with RMSE = 0.128 and R2 = 0.99 in training stage and RMSE = 0.115 and R2 = 0.99 in testing stage.

In this study, we utilize one or more features of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) tests and Apolipoprotein-E genotype sequence that provides more signifi cant biomarkers for the early prediction. The ML classifi ers including Support vector classifi er, Gaussian process, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Decision trees learns the subset of patterns that predicts the AD with gene descriptors from microRNA expression profi le and the profi led gene pattern. These signifi cant multiple gene descriptors provide a supportive prediction methodology that apply genotype strength with the ensemble classifi ers. The fi nal optimal model is given by validation evaluations. The support vector classifi er and Random Forest classifi ers had given consistent results for disease conversion and progression from MRI attributes and had given promising results with the validation that showed accuracy greater than 80% and F1 weighted score of 0.8 in disease classifi cation and prognosis. The experimental results had proven 95% accuracy in the saliency values of APOE isoforms implemented in DragonNN framework that will vary AD pathogenic.

Exploring the Feasibility in Applying an Automated Essay Scoring to a writing test of Korean language. Bilingual Research 86, 00-00. The present study aimed at exploring the feasibility of the automated scoring in a writing test of Korean language. To this end, a scoring model was constructed and score prediction was performed by utilizing machine learning based on writing responses and their scoring data from the pesudo-test of Sejong Korean language Assessment (SKA). Random Forest, one of the representative supervised learning algorithms, was used for this machine learning, and the performance of the scoring model was validated in terms of ‘Accuracy,’ ‘Precision,’ ‘Recall,’ ‘F1,’ and ‘Kappa’ values. As a result, the performance of the scoring model in the two scoring domains of 'language use' and 'content' was good even though the data size for machine learning in this study was very small and the scoring rubric was not customized for the SKA writing test items. This results showed very positive implications for applying an automated scoring to the SKA writing test. In particular, the correlation between scores predicted by the automated scoring model and given by the human rater was smaller than that between scores by two human raters, however, the difference of the two groups was just about .10, which might be overcome by using a larger amount of data for machine learning and customizing automated scoring features.(Inha University, Gwangju University of Education, King Sejong Institute Foundation)"
Why Social Capital Matters for the Success of REDD+ Programs,2022,"['social capital', 'REDD+', 'poverty', 'community forestry', 'Myanmar']",,"Background and objective: We quantitatively estimated the impact of social capital on poverty reduction using a surveyconducted on 335 randomly selected households in 6 villages running REDD+ programs in Bago Province, Myanmar. Ourcentral question is whether the effectiveness of REDD+ programs is associated with social capital, including networks,trust, cooperation, and social inclusion.Methods: We developed a tool to measure social capital while considering forest conservation activities, and quantitativelyanalyzed the impact of social capital on poverty levels in 6 villages running REDD+ programs in Myanmar.Results: Our results reveal that social capital has a significant effect in alleviating household poverty in Myanmar. Thus,investment in social capital may help alleviate poverty. REDD+ training participants and community forestry membersshowed a relatively higher level of social capital than those who did not participate. We also found that forest dependentswere statistically significantly more likely to live in poverty, which implies that socially marginalized residents tend to relymore on forests and that collecting forest products has limited effects on overcoming poverty.Conclusion: The local strategy for implementing REDD+ programs should target community forestry members to promotetheir social capital by supporting forest tenures and benefit sharing among marginalized people."
뇌-컴퓨터 인터랙션 오탐 저감을 위한 뇌파-턱 근전도 통합 신호 제어 프로토콜 개발,2022,"['Brain computer interface', 'False alarm correction', 'Steady-State visually evoked potential', 'Machine learning', 'Random forest']",,"(EMG) induced by jaw-clenching can be accurately observed in steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) signals at occipital lobes as well as temporal lobes. We also investigated a feasibility that the fused SSVEP data with the jaw-clenching EMG can be classified as a function of task types characterized by SSVEPs with and without the short and long clenching noise. Based on this hypothesis, we proposed a novel command protocol to effectively and efficiently reduce false alarms caused by using SSVEP brain-computer interface (BCI).Background: Much attention has been paid to various brain-computer interfaces for neural rehabilitation and alternative communication channels for disabled people with severe neurological disorders. However, despite the interests in BCI, false alarms caused by interference effects between command flickers with different frequencies or internal and external noises have been still problematic and have yet to be investigated. Even though protocols to correct the false alarms based on error-related potential (ErrP) or eye blinks have been proposed, it has still limitation due to errors inherent in involuntary reactions of humans. Thus, it is necessary to develop a protocol to address the issue and propose a method insusceptible to the involuntary reactions.Method: Nine undergraduate students (3 female) voluntarily participated in the experiment. They were asked to divide their attention between the two squares randomly oscillating with 8.57 and 10Hz and perform three types of tasks characterized by SSVEP only, short clenching, and long clenching conditions. They carried out the three tasks with a semi-counterbalanced and random order and rest interval between the tasks was set to 10 minutes to minimize order and carryover effects. It took about 12 minutes in completing the experimental tasks for each participant. We used five machine learning algorithms of binary classification to compare the performance in classifying the brainwave signals characterized by the three tasks.Results: As a result of the classification comparison, random forest showed the highest classification performance of more than 0.85 (AUC) as follows: 0.88 (short clenching vs. SSVEP), 0.87 (long clenching vs. SSVEP), 0.85 (long clenching vs. short clenching condition) in the test data set. Notably, the findings implicated a clear classification in the long cand short clenching condition even at the frequency band of more than 20Hz. For the participants whose highest weight factor was shown at the occipital lobe, it can be possible to reduce false alarms in the SSVEP BCI with only single electrode at the occipital lobe.Conclusion: The findings found in this study implicate that the proposed protocol can be used to effectively and efficiently correct false alarms in event-related potential (ERP), event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) BCI as well as SSVEP BCI. On top of that, classifying the subtle changes in the jaw clenching types enables BCI developers to create additional commands to modulate their BCI system. The results can be greatly improved if weight factors in the binary classification are modulated as a function of individual characteristics.Application: The findings obtained in this study can be utilized in developing asynchronous BCI very robust to false alarms and expected to provide a future direction into hybrid BCI system."

In this study, we applied two machine learning methods-random survival forests (RSF) and support vector machines (SVM)-for survival analysis and compared their prediction performance using the SEER and KOTUS-BP datasets. Three schemes were used for model development and evaluation. First, we utilized data from SEER for model development and used data from KOTUS-BP for external evaluation. Second, these two datasets were swapped by taking data from KOTUS-BP for model development and data from SEER for external evaluation. Finally, we mixed these two datasets half and half and utilized the mixed datasets for model development and validation. We used 9,624 patients from SEER and 3,281 patients from KOTUS-BP to construct a prediction model with seven covariates: age, sex, histologic differentiation, adjuvant treatment, resection margin status, and the American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th edition T-stage and N-stage. Comparing the three schemes, the performance of the Cox model, RSF, and SVM was better when using the mixed datasets than when using the unmixed datasets.

Ensemble-Based Methodology to Identify Optimal Personal Mobility Service Areas Using Public Data,2022,"['Big data', 'Ensemble model', 'Random forest', 'Extreme gradient boosting', 'Hexagonal grid', 'Personal mobility', 'Public transportation']",,"Public transportation networks are well established in main cities, but there are some inconveniences in using public transportation in some cities. Public transportation is less accessible and walking distance of getting to public transportation is too long in some cities. Compared to other cities, Seoul has a higher satisfaction rate with public transportation. There are many cases, however, where short-distance taxis are used because walking to destinations after using public transportation is inconvenient; instead, Personal mobility (PM) devices can be used for these short-distances trip. This study aims to find the optimal PM service area using GIS (Geographic Information System)-based public transportation big data analyses. Variables were generated by collecting socio-economic factors, public transportation data, and geographic data and Extreme gradient boosting and Random forest, which are representative ensemble methods, were used for evaluation. We divided Seoul into a hexagonal grid and developed the optimal PM location service model by creating hexagonal cell data units and analyzing the areas with the models. We found that residential complexes, parks, and near subway stations (all areas with high foot traffic) are best suited for optimal placement. We also determined deployment should be in lower sloped areas.

UNDERSTANDING PEDESTRIANS’ CAR-HAILING INTENTION IN TRAFFIC SCENES,2022,"['Car-hailing intention', 'GCN', 'Random forest', 'Autonomous taxi']",,"This study aims at the automatic understanding of pedestrians’ car-hailing intention in traffic scenes. Traffic scenes are highly complex, with a completely random spatial distribution of pedestrians. Different pedestrians use different behavior to express car-hailing intention, making it difficult to accurately understand the intention of pedestrians for autonomous taxis in complex scenes. A novel intention recognition algorithm with interpretability is proposed in this paper to solve the above problems. Firstly, we employ OpenPose to obtain skeleton data and the facial region. Then, we input the facial region into a facial attention network to extract the facial attention features and infer whether the pedestrian is paying attention to the ego-vehicle. In addition, the skeleton data are also input into a random forest classifier and GCN to extract both explicit and implicit pose features. Finally, an interpretable fusion rule is proposed to fuse the facial and pose features.The fusion algorithm can accurately and stably infer the pedestrians’ intention and identify pedestrians with car-hailing intentions. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we collected road videos using experimental cars to obtain suitable datasets, and established the corresponding evaluation benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has high accuracy and robustness."

However, the current agricultural product price prediction system based on historical auction cost and transaction data is difficult to accurately predict agricultural product prices. Therefore, in order to solve the problem of supply and demand of agricultural products due to changes in the production area environment, this paper created a model to predict how the price of agricultural products will change according to the meteorological environment of the crop production area. Strawberries with the highest added value and the most traded in Korea were selected for prediction. To predict the price of agricultural products, related data were collected and a random forest algorithm was applied. As a result of the study, the RMSE, which indicates the difference between the predicted price and the actual price by the model, was 0.102, which is interpreted as explaining the price of agricultural products relatively well. Accurate price prediction of agricultural products is expected to be useful if the government adjusts the supply of agricultural products and makes it a service for general consumers to use."

The BART model is specified as the sum of trees and is calculated using the Bayesian backfitting algorithm. Throughout the extensive simulation studies, the strengths and drawbacks of the two methods in the presence of missing data, high-dimensional data, or highly correlated data are investigated. In the presence of missing data, BART performs well in general, whereas RF provides adequate coverage. The BART outperforms in high dimensional, highly correlated data. However, in all of the scenarios considered, the RF has a shorter computation time. The performance of the two methods is also compared using two real data sets that represent the aforementioned situations, and the same conclusion is reached."

Optimal Number of Cardiac Cycles for Continuous Blood Pressure Estimation,2022,"['Cardiac cycles', 'Blood pressure', 'Cuffless', 'Random forest']",,"Continuous blood pressure monitoring is essential for patients with hypertension. Most studies have suggested cuffless blood pressure monitoring techniques using a single cardiac cycle based on the pulse transit time. This paper investigates feature extraction from multiple cardiac cycles to estimate blood pressure. This implementation uses electrocardiogram, photoplethysmogram, and ballistrocardiagram signals. Random forest was applied to estimate blood pressure using the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation technique. The results show that the model could achieve better performance when using three cardiac cycles with an average MAE of 3.364 ± 3.059 mmHg for the diastolic blood pressure and 4.201 ±2.355 mmHg for the systolic blood pressure."
Non-destructive Prediction of Nicotine Content in Tobacco Using Hyperspectral Image–Derived Spectra and Machine Learning,2022,"['Chemometrics', 'Partial least squares regression', 'Random forest', 'Support vector regression', 'Variable importance in projection']",,"Purpose Rapid prediction of tobacco nicotine content in tobacco industries has become essential to maintain a stable and reliable cigarette quality. This research deals with combining hyperspectral images (HSI) and chemometric models to predict nicotine content in powdered tobacco samples.Methods Fifty-seven dried powdered tobacco leaf samples were scanned using a hyperspectral camera followed by image processing. The region of interest (ROI) was selected for calculating average spectra. The average spectra and the destructive measurements of nicotine concentration in the samples were used to develop four regression models based on partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and PLSR–variable importance in projection (PLSR– VIP). The models were evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and on 15% test dataset.Results The PLSR outperformed (R2=0.93, RMSE= 0.21%) SVR- and RF-based nicotine prediction models using the entire 970–1700-nm range. Five bands centred at 976.15 nm, 1452 nm, 1575.5 nm, 1592.3 nm, and 1698.9 nm were identified as effective wavelengths for nicotine content prediction and used by the PLSR–variable importance in projection (PLSR–VIP) model to produce satisfactory validation performance (R2=0.91, RMSE= 0.30%). The LOOCV yielded R2 values ranging between 0.89 and 0.93 for the evaluated models.Conclusion The PLSR-VIP model with 96% fewer wavelengths than the full range PLSR highlighted its potential for a more simplistic nicotine prediction mechanism. The HSI plus chemometric model approach has shown the potential to predict tobacco nicotine content rapidly."
Hybrid Model for Renewable Energy and Load Forecasting Based on Data Mining and EWT,2022,"['Renewable resource', 'Load', 'Empirical wavelet transform', 'Improved random forest', 'Prediction level', 'Accommodation']",,"Accurate renewable resource (RES) and load prediction play key roles in the power grid planning schemes, eff ective dispatch, and stable operation of power systems. The proportions of wind and solar energy continue to increase, leading to wind and light abandonment. Thus, the absorption of wind and photovoltaic power is particularly important. On the basis of accurately predicting load, wind power and photovoltaic output, the accommodation capacity of wind and photovoltaic power is analyzed. The work contains fi ve parts, as follows: (1) empirical wavelet transform (EWT) is used to decompose wind power and load. At the same time, isolated forest (iForest) and fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM) are used to process photovoltaic data. (2) Low frequency and intermediate frequency components of load are predicted by improved random forest (IRF). High frequency component of load is clustered by improved density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (IDBSCAN). The processing model is selected on the basis of the characteristics of each class sample. Each component of wind power are predicted by IRF. (3) Photovoltaic power of each category is predicted by IRF. (4) Diff erent components of load and wind power data are added. The photovoltaic power forecast data are synthesized according to the time point. (5) The forecast value of load, wind power, and photovoltaic output of a city are comprehensively evaluated by the summarized prediction level indicators. Three accommodation indicators are used for analyzing the accommodation capacity of wind power and photovoltaic. Results show that the forecasting methods of load, wind power, and photovoltaic power can generate better forecasting results than conventional methods. The analysis results of supplementary prediction level and accommodation indices provide reference for eff ective grid dispatching, sustainable, and healthy energy development."

We use ｢Korea Social Integration Survey｣ data by pooling together all observations collected between 2014 and 2019. Results show that individual’s perceived fairness is significantly affected by their perception towards the major governmental and social institutions that operating the entire social system, rather than individuals’ characteristics such as gender and age, or their socio-economic status. It implies that it is hard to improve the perceptions of fairness among members of society without enhancing reliability and transparency of major social and public organizations. Thus it is necessary to pay attention to the responsibilities of corporations and the legislature as well as criminal justice institutes in these days when economic inequality is high and the role of states is strengthened.

In this study, an upgraded random forest (RF)-based evaluation tool was proposed to extract clinical knowledge of TKM doctors. Also, it was confirmed to what extent the professors clinical knowledge was delivered to the trainees by using the evaluation tool. The data used to construct the evaluation tool were targeted at 106 people who visited the Sasang Constitutional Department at Kyung Hee University Korean Medicine Hospital at Gangdong. For explicit knowledge extraction, four TKM doctors were asked to express the importance of symptoms as scores. In addition, for implicit knowledge extraction, importance score was confirmed in the RF model that learned the patients symptoms and the TKM doctors constitutional determination results. In order to confirm the delivery of clinical knowledge, the similarity of symptoms that professors and trainees consider important when discriminating constitution was calculated using the Jaccard coefficient. As a result of the study, our proposed tool was able to successfully evaluate the clinical knowledge of TKM doctors.

Exploring modern machine learning methods to improve causal-effect estimation,2022,"['average causal effect', 'doubly-robust estimation', 'inverse probability weighting', 'propensity score', 'random forest', 'targeted learning']",,"This paper addresses the use of machine learning methods for causal estimation of treatment effects from observational data. Even though conducting randomized experimental trials is a gold standard to reveal potential causal relationships, observational study is another rich source for investigation of exposure effects, for example, in the research of comparative effectiveness and safety of treatments, where the causal effect can be identified if covariates contain all confounding variables. In this context, statistical regression models for the expected outcome and the probability of treatment are often imposed, which can be combined in a clever way to yield more efficient and robust causal estimators. Recently, targeted maximum likelihood estimation and causal random forest is proposed and extensively studied for the use of data-adaptive regression in estimation of causal inference parameters. Machine learning methods are a natural choice in these settings to improve the quality of the final estimate of the treatment effect. We explore how we can adapt the design and training of several machine learning algorithms for causal inference and study their finite-sample performance through simulation experiments under various scenarios. Application to the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) data shows that these adaptations can improve simple linear regression-based methods."

For this, we tried to examine whether, after implementation of the Free Semester System, middle-school students decided on the high-school type that they wished to be admitted to, not based on those like their academic achievement and top-raked high schools, but more based on those like their aptitude, interests, and career path or not. Methods Based on 2015 when the free semester system started in Gyeonggido, students were divided into two different groups; students who haven’t experienced the free semester system are classified as panel 1 (from 2012 to 2014) and students who experienced are panel 2 (from 2015 to 2017). Next, the decision factors were extracted for selecting the high school type, using the decision tree among the data-making techniques. Then the priority list was sequentially listed using random post analysis. Results According to the analysis results of random forest, the keyword list of panel 1 was presented in order of math score, English score, English proficiency test, monthly education cost, Korean language score. On the other hand, the keyword list of panel 2 was shown in order of English score, math score, self-efficiency, career planning, and Korean score. Conclusions The major determinant of high school type selection is students’ academic record regardless of operation of the free semester program. That is, it is verified that the free semester system doesn’t have any influence on high school type selection contrary to the purpose of the free semester system. We can say, However, the free semester system had a positive effectiveness on the choice of high school type because priority of a part of variables related to the free semester system(career planning, self-efficacy, reading activity, career self-understanding, subject-specific interests) has increased despite short-term implementation of the free semester system when we analyze the trend in priority influencing the choice of high school type."

missForest with feature selection using binary particle swarm optimization improves the imputation accuracy of continuous data,2022,"['Imputation', 'Feature selection', 'Binary particle swarm optimization', 'missForest']",,"Background: Missing data are a common problem in large-scale datasets and its appropriate handling is crucial for data analyses. Missingness can be categorized as (1) missing completely at random (MCAR), (2) missing at random (MAR), and (3) missing not at random (MNAR). Different missingness mechanisms require different imputation strategies. Multiple imputation, an approach for averaging outcomes across multiple imputed data, is more suitable than single imputation for dealing with various missing mechanisms. missForest, a nonparametric missing value imputation strategy using random forest, is one of the most prevalent multiple imputation methods for missing-data because it can be applied to mixed-type data and does not require distributional assumptions. However, a recent study found that missForest can produce biased results for non-normal data. In addition, missForest is computationally expensive.Objective: Therefore, we aimed to further develop the missForest algorithm by combining a binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO)-based feature-selection strategy.Methods: The BPSO is an evolutionary algorithm that is well known for global optimization and computational efficiency. By using the BPSO-based feature selection step prior to imputing missing values with missForest, the imputation accuracy for continuous variables could be increased by pruning redundant variables.Results: In this study, missForest with BPSO (BPSOmf) showed better imputation accuracy than missForest alone with respect to continuous variables by feature selection prior to the imputation step.Conclusions: BPSOmf is an appropriate and robust method when the imputation target data consist mainly of continuous variables."

As a result, penalized regression outperformed random forest, and elastic net was chosen over LASSO(Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) due to its capability to handle possible multicollinearity issues. After prediction models were separately built for male and female students via the Elastic net, new predictors yet uninvestigated in previous research were identified and summarized as follows. First, the predictors that were commonly selected from the male and female models included school variables such as foreign language class hours and performing arts class-taking. Second, male predictors were mostly individual (e.g., resilience and cross-cultural acceptance).

Machine Learning-Based Predictor for Treatment Outcomes of Patients With Salivary Gland Cancer After Operation,2022,"['Deep learning', 'Machine learning', 'Prognosis', 'Salivary gland cancer.']",,"Background and Objectives The purpose of this study was to analyze the survival data of salivary gland cancer (SGCs) patients to construct machine learning and deep learning mod- els that can predict survival and use them to stratify SGC patients according to risk estimate. Subjects and Method We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathologic data from 460 pa- tients with SGCs from 2006 to 2018.Results In Cox proportional hazard (CPH) model, pM, stage, lymphovascular invasion, lymph node ratio, and age exhibited significant correlation with patient’s survival. In the CPH model, the c-index value for the training set was 0.85, and that for the test set was 0.81. In the Random Survival Forest model, the c-index value for the training set was 0.86, and that for the test set was 0.82. Stage and age exhibited high importance in both the Random Survival For- est and CPH models. In the deep learning-based model, the c-index value was 0.72 for the training set and 0.72 for the test set. Among the three models mentioned above, the Random Survival Forest model exhibited the highest performance in predicting the survival of SGC patients.Conclusion A survival prediction model using machine learning techniques showed accept- able performance in predicting the survival of SGC patients. Although large-scale clinical and multicenter studies should be conducted to establish more powerful predictive model, we ex- pect that individualized treatment can be realized according to risk stratification made by the machine learning model."

Methods: This studywas conducted using data from the Korean Frailty and Aging Cohort Study (KFACS). The KFACS participants were classifiedas robust or frail based on Fried’s frailty phenotype and excluded if they did not properly answer the questions, resulting in1,066 robust and 165 frail participants. We then selected influential features through feature selection and trained the modelusing support vector machine, random forest, and gradient boosting algorithms with the prepared dataset. Due to the imbalanceddistribution in the dataset with a low sample size, holdout was applied with stratified 10-fold and cross-validationfor estimating the model performance. The reliability of the constructed model was validated using an unseen test set. Themodel was then trained with hyperparameter optimization. Results: During the feature selection process, 27 features wereidentified as meaningful factors for frailty. The model was trained based on the selected features, and the weighted averageF1-score reached 95.30% with the random forest algorithm. Conclusions: The results of the study demonstrated the possibilityof adopting machine learning to strengthen existing frailty criteria. As the method analyzes questionnaire responses in ashort time, it can support higher volumes of data on participants’ health conditions and alert them regarding potential risksin advance."

Of the 80,866 samples classified as normal auto accidents and 862 ones detected as insurance fraud by the Korea Rental Car Mutual Aid Association, 60,000 and 600 samples, respectively, were used to construct an insurance fraud detection model and tested the model with the rest of the data. We compared the results of a logistic model with that of a random forest technique, however, the prediction powers from both methods were not as high. The reasons may be the observational variables are limited and/or many cases of insurance fraud might be included in the case of normal auto accidents.In this study, we figured out 14 variables indicating insurance fraud symptoms using rental cars and 4 characteristics that were not revealed in the previous studies were found. We propose that more variables that represent the characteristics of the victims, of the perpetrators, of the injuries, and the treatment of the victims, which we have not collected, should be specifically observed and continuously accumulated."

Therefore, this study aims to develop predictive modes of transportation through the use of smartphone data and smartwatches and the use of machine learning techniques. To achieve the objective of this study, a review of the studies related to the use of algorithms to predict transportation modes was prepared. Besides, on the practical side, the Physical Activity for Smart Travel (PASTA) platform has been developed. Two groups of participants were recruited in Michigan and Texas to obtain the required data for the study. Daily activities have been classified into activities related to transportation (trips) and non-related to transportation (work, home, shopping, etc.), then focusing exclusively on transportation activities to determine their modes. In this study, four machine learning methods were used for prediction (Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine) and using the data of physical activities as a new feature not used in prior studies. The accuracy of the methods of transportation mode prediction was compared through the training and testing phases. The results of the predictions were compared with the activities verified by the participants. The results showed that the method of Random Forest performed better than other methods.

Among artificial intelligence techniques, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which are commonly used for time series data, only estimate in the direction of time flow or in the reverse direction to the missing estimation position, so the estimation performance is poor in the long-term missing section. On the other hand, in this study, estimation performance can be improved even for long-term missing data by estimating in both directions before and after the missing section. Also, by using all available data around the observation point (sea surface temperature, temperature, wind field, atmospheric pressure, humidity), the imputation performance was further improved by estimating the imputation data from these correlations together. For performance verification, a statistical model, Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), a machine learning-based Random Forest model, and an RNN model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) were compared. For imputation of long-term missing for 7 days, the average accuracy of the BiRNN/ statistical models is 70.8%/61.2%, respectively, and the average error is 0.28 degrees/0.44 degrees, respectively, so the BiRNN model performs better than other models. By applying a temporal decay factor representing the missing pattern, it is judged that the BiRNN technique has better imputation performance than the existing method as the missing section becomes longer."

This paper proposes a timely frost prediction model based on machine learning using environmental data. Because of minority information on frost, conventional approaches often suffer from the class imbalance problem with rare labeling data. We address these issues through a frost prediction model using class-balanced data by SMOTE method to environmental datasets collected from IoT stations when predictive service executes. Our experimental results demonstrate that the frost prediction using Random Forest is the most suitable algorithm.With the optimization process, the performance of the frost prediction model was improved by about 4% (Based on f1).

Among the most popular and easily recognized plant seasonal phenomena among the indicators of the climate change impact evaluation, the blooming day of flower and the peak day of autumn leaves were modeled. The types of plants used in the modeling were forsythia and cherry trees, which can be seen as representative plants of spring, and maple and ginkgo, which can be seen as representative plants of autumn. Weather data used to perform modeling were temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation observed through the ASOS Observatory of the Korea Meteorological Administration. As satellite data, MODIS NDVI was used for modeling, and it has a correlation coefficient of about –0.2 for the flowering date and 0.3 for the autumn leaves peak date. As the model used, the model was established using multiple regression models, which are linear models, and Random Forest, which are nonlinear models. In addition, the predicted values estimated by each model were expressed as isopleth maps using spatial interpolation techniques to express the trend of plant seasonal changes from 2003 to 2020.

This provided basic data for preparing a traffic safety system for elderly drivers and establishing policies.METHODS : Based on machine learning, the major factors influencing accident severity (from the analysis of traffic accident data for elderly drivers) were analyzed and compared with existing statistical analysis results. The machine learning algorithm used the Scikit-learn library and Python 3.8. A hyperparameter optimization process was performed to improve the safety and accuracy of the model. To establish the optimal state of the model, the hyperparameters were set (K = 5) using K-fold cross-validation. The hyperparameter search applied the most widely utilized grid search method, and the performance evaluation derived the optimal hyperparameter value using neutral squared error indicators.RESULTS : The traffic laws, road sections of traffic accidents, and time zones of accidents were analyzed for accidents involving elderly drivers in Daejeon Metropolitan City, and the importance of the variables was examined. For the analysis, a linear regression model, machine learning-based decision tree, and random forest model were used, and based on the root mean square error, the random forest accuracy performance was found to be the best. Ultimately, 18 variables were analyzed, including traffic violations, accident time zones, and road types. The variables influencing the accident severity were the speed, signal violation, intersection section, late-night driving, and pedestrian protection violation, with the relative importance of the variables in the order of speed (0.3490966), signal violation (0.285967), and late-night driving (0.173108). These can be seen as variables related to the expansion of life damage owing to physical aging and reduced judgment abilities arising from decreases in cognitive function.CONCLUSIONS : Restricting the driving of the elderly on the expressway and at night is reasonable, but specific standards for driving restrictions should be prepared based on individual driving capabilities."

In the Red River Delta in Vietnam, several million residents possess a high risk of chronic As poisoning. The As releases into groundwater caused by natural process through microbially-driven reductive dissolution of Fe (III) oxides. It has been extracted by Red River residents using private tube wells for drinking and daily purposes because of their unawareness of the contamination. This long-term consumption of As-contaminated groundwater could lead to various health problems. Therefore, a predictive model would be useful to expose contamination risks of the wells in the Red River Delta Vietnam area. This study used four machine learning algorithms to predict the As probability of study sites in Red River Delta, Vietnam. The GBM was the best performing model with the accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity of 98.7%, 100%, 95.2%, and 100%, respectively. In addition, it resulted the highest AUC of 92% and 96% for the PRC and ROC curves, with Eh and Fe as the most important variables. The partial dependence plot of As concentration on the model parameters showed that the probability of high level of As is related to the low number of wells’ depth, Eh, and SO₄, along with high PO₄³⁻ and NH₄⁺.

Most of the preceding studies have limitations in that they are limited to social and economic factors and statistical analysis. Therefore, in this study, by applying the spatiotemporal concept to quantitatively calculate the decrease in public library loan demand due to rainfall and heatwave, by clustering areas with high demand for book loan due to weather changes and areas where it is not, factors inside and outside public libraries and After the combination, changes in public library loan demand according to weather changes were analyzed. As a result of the analysis, there was a difference in the decrease due to the weather for each public library, and it was found that there were some differences depending on the characteristics and spatial location of the public library. Also, when the temperature was over 35℃, the decrease in book loan demand increased significantly. As internal factors, the number of seats, the number of books, and area were derived. As external factors, the public library access ramp, cafe, reading room, floating population in their teens, and floating population of women in their 30s/40s were analyzed as important variables. The results of this analysis are judged to contribute to the establishment of policies to promote the use of public libraries in consideration of the weather in a specific season, and also suggested limitations of the study."

However, Conogethes punctiferalis has been increasingly causing economic damages to chestnuts and walnuts. Currently, its management is mainly relayed on aerial application of pesticides. To select pesticides of C. punctiferalis for aerial application, damage rate of chestnut and walnut fruits and death rate of C. punctiferalis were analyzed according to selected pesticides.Experiments were conducted during two years by randomly applying chemical pesticide (i.e., Chlorfluazuron 5 % in 2018 and Thiacloprid 10 % in 2019), organic pesticide (i.e., paraffin oil 8 % + plant extracts (90 %) from Styphnolobium japonicum, Melia azedarach, and Dysphania ambrosioides), and no treatment (i.e., control) into an area which were divided into three from a whole commercial field. All pesticides used in this study could suppress damages of walnuts and chestnuts by C. punctiferalis. However, these pesticides could not kill their larvae inside of fruits. Thus, aerial spraying these pesticides for C. punctiferalis should be applied at optimal timing or slightly earlier than optimal timing. By considering honeybee toxicity, cost, and management effi ciency, Chlorfluazuron 5 % was the best as an aerial application pesticide among these three pesticide in this study."

The forecasting accuracy of these four prediction models was compared by changing the preprocessing methods. There are four preprocessing methods proposed in this paper. First, training data is designed by averaging closest four points using the weighted average. Furthermore, training data is designed by averaging points within a circle using the weighted average. Second, various prediction intervals are tested. Third, we propose a data selection method by analyzing the correlation of each parameter. Fourth, the data interpolation is tested.

The models adopted for performance assessment included decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB), which was fed by the data sets collected from two monitoring stations in the Nakdong River during 2018-2021. A 7:3 ratio was used to prepare training and testing sets for three prediction models and their hyperparmeters were tuned to improve the accuracy of prediction. We found that XGB which was not sensitive to input data resolution outperformed the other two models, DT and RF. In contrast, the prediction error for DT model decreased progressively in response to increasing monitoring frequency from 7 through 3 to 1 day as well as after applying post-pruning, regardless of dependent variables. When the accuracy of prediction for RF model was assessed as a function of the number of independent variables, more than 4 variables was effective in maintaining its prediction performance as compared to all variables adopted. Therefore, both monitoring frequency and pruning play an important role in reducing the prediction error of decision tree models, in addition to hyperparameter optimization."

In this study, we applied several ML classifiers, including decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) to the prediction of hydrological drought classes. Daily data of precipitation, reservoir inflow, and reservoir volume collected from three large dams (Andong, Chungju, and Seomjin) in South Korea were used as classifier input to predict hydrological drought alert levels. A comparison of the accuracy and computation time of each ML classifier revealed that the classifiers were capable of predicting hydrological drought alert levels, with the SVM achieving outstanding performance in terms of accuracy (97%) and precision (89%) and the NB exhibiting superior computational time (0.63 sec). The results of this study indicated that the ML classifiers can be effective predictors of hydrological drought classes and can provide warnings of drought conditions."

The primary outcome was to assess the feasibility of using the random forest (RF) and Naive Bayes (NB) machine learning algorithms to predict the need for preclinical airway management. The secondary outcome was to use a principal component analysis to determine the attributes that can be used and advanced for future model development.Results In total, 25,556 adults with multiple injuries were identified, including 1,451 patients (5.7%) who required airway management. Key attributes were auscultation, injury pattern, oxygen therapy, thoracic drainage, noninvasive ventilation, catecholamines, pelvic sling, colloid infusion, initial vital signs, preemergency status, and shock index. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was between 0.96 (RF; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96–0.97) and 0.93 (NB; 95% CI, 0.92–0.93; P<0.01).

In this study, using the mathematics learning data of elementary school 5th to 6th graders conducting blended mathematics classes, we tried to find out what factors predict mathematics academic achievement and developed an artificial intelligence model that predicts mathematics academic performance using the results. Math learning propensity, LMS data, and evaluation results of 205 elementary school students had analyzed with a random forest model. Confidence, anxiety, interest, self-management, and confidence in math learning strategy were included as mathematics learning disposition. The progress rate, number of learning times, and learning time of the e-learning site were collected as LMS data. For evaluation data, results of diagnostic test and unit test were used. As a result of the analysis it was found that the mathematics learning strategy was the most important factor in predicting low-achieving students among mathematics learning propensities. The LMS training data had a negligible effect on the prediction. This study suggests that an AI model can predict low-achieving students with learning data generated in a blended math class. In addition, it is expected that the results of the analysis will provide specific information for teachers to evaluate and give feedback to students."

기계학습을 통한 주간 반투명 구름탐지 연구: GK-2A/AMI를 이용하여,2022,"['GK-2A/AMI', 'Transparent cloud', 'Cloud detection', 'Machine learning']",,"Clouds are composed of tiny water droplets, ice crystals, or mixtures suspended in the atmosphere and cover about two-thirds of the Earth's surface. Cloud detection in satellite images is a very difficult task to separate clouds and non-cloud areas because of similar reflectance characteristics to some other ground objects or the ground surface. In contrast to thick clouds, which have distinct characteristics, thin transparent clouds have weak contrast between clouds and background in satellite images and appear mixed with the ground surface. In order to overcome the limitations of transparent clouds in cloud detection, this study conducted cloud detection focusing on transparent clouds using machine learning techniques (Random Forest [RF], Convolutional Neural Networks [CNN]). As reference data, Cloud Mask and Cirrus Mask were used in MOD35 data provided by MOderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and the pixel ratio of training data was configured to be about 1:1:1 for clouds, transparent clouds, and clear sky for model training considering transparent cloud pixels. As a result of the qualitative comparison of the study, bothRF and CNN successfully detected various types of clouds, including transparent clouds, and in the case of RF+CNN, which mixed the results of the RF model and the CNN model, the cloud detection was well performed, and was confirmed that the limitations of the model were improved.

In addition, SMOTE has been chosen to address the issue recently. But,Out-of-Distribution samples have been studied just with neural networks. It seems to be hardly shown that Out-of-Distribution detectionis applied to the predictive model using conventional machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest and KNN.

Cloud Removal Using Gaussian Process Regression for Optical Image Reconstruction,2022,"['Cloud removal', 'Image reconstruction', 'Machine learning', 'Gaussian process']",,"Cloud removal is often required to construct time-series sets of optical images for environmental monitoring. In regression-based cloud removal, the selection of an appropriate regression model and the impact analysis of the input images significantly affect the prediction performance. This study evaluates the potential of Gaussian process (GP) regression for cloud removal and also analyzes the effects of cloud-free optical images and spectral bands on prediction performance. Unlike other machine learning-based regression models, GP regression provides uncertainty information and automatically optimizes hyperparameters. An experiment using Sentinel-2 multi-spectral images was conducted for cloud removal in the two agricultural regions. The prediction performance of GP regression was compared with that of random forest (RF) regression. Various combinations of input images and multi-spectral bands were considered for quantitative evaluations. The experimental results showed that using multi-temporal images with multi-spectral bands as inputs achieved the best prediction accuracy. Highly correlated adjacent multi-spectral bands and temporally correlated multi-temporal images resulted in an improved prediction accuracy. The prediction performance of GP regression was significantly improved in predicting the near-infrared band compared to that of RF regression. Estimating the distribution function of input data in GP regression could reflect the variations in the considered spectral band with a broader range. In particular, GP regression was superior to RF regression for reproducing structural patterns at both sites in terms of structural similarity. In addition, uncertainty information provided by GP regression showed a reasonable similarity to prediction errors for some sub-areas, indicating that uncertainty estimates may be used to measure the prediction result quality. These findings suggest that GP regression could be beneficial for cloud removal and optical image reconstruction. In addition, the impact analysis results of the input images provide guidelines for selecting optimal images for regression-based cloud removal."

Accurate prediction of favorable outcomes in severe TBI patients could assist with optimizing treatment procedures, predicting clinical outcomes, and result in substantial economic savings.Methods: In this study, we examined the capability of a machine learning-based model in predicting “favorable” or “unfavorable” outcomes after 6 months in severe TBI patients using only parameters measured on admission. Three models were developed using logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines trained on parameters recorded from 2,381 severe TBI patients admitted to the neuro-intensive care unit of Rajaee (Emtiaz) Hospital (Shiraz, Iran) between 2015 and 2017. Model performance was evaluated using three indices: sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. A ten-fold cross-validation method was used to estimate these indices.Results: Overall, the developed models showed excellent performance with AUC around 0.81, sensitivity and specificity of around 0.78. The top-three factors important in predicting 6-month post-trauma survival status in TBI patients are “Glasgow coma scale motor response,” “pupillary reactivity,” and “age.”Conclusions: Machine learning techniques might be used to predict the 6-month outcome in TBI patients using only the parameters measured on admission when the machine learning is trained using a large data set."

To address this difficult task, 14 data sources were collected from the literature to build a dataset of 164 samples. The dataset included seven mixture design features (e.g., aggregate-to-cement ratio, water-to-cement ratio, minimum coarse aggregate size, the presence of sand or silica fume, effective porosity, and the compressive strength). This dataset was trained and tested by the most relevant machine learning methods: the extreme gradient boosting method (XGB), the random forest regression method, and the support vector machine method. The Particle Swarm Optimization method was applied to tune the models’ hyperparameters. It was observed that the extreme gradient boosting method significantly outperformed the accuracy of the other methods. Relatively high R-squared values of 0.92 and 0.88 were obtained for the compressive strength and effective porosity predictions. Furthermore, to account for the role of compaction, the original database was refined to obtain a 36 samples subset that considered compaction energy. Based on our assessment of this subset, results yielded superior R-squared values up to 0.99 for compressive strength, and 0.97 for effective porosity, revealing the effectiveness and accuracy of this research."

We used a random forest machine learning algorithm to calculate the coefficient of positivity and negativity of words used in reviews. As the result, we were able to build a dictionary of words for positive and negative sentiment using each word’s coefficient. We classified words into four major evaluation categories and derived insights into sentiment in each criterion.

Radiomics Analysis of Magnetic Resonance Proton Density Fat Fraction for the Diagnosis of Hepatic Steatosis in Patients With Suspected Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease,2022,"['Radiomics', 'Liver Steatosis', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Proton Density Fat Fraction', 'Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease']",,"Background: This study aimed to assess the diagnostic feasibility of radiomics analysis based on magnetic resonance (MR)-proton density fat fraction (PDFF) for grading hepatic steatosis in patients with suspected non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).Methods: This retrospective study included 106 patients with suspected NAFLD who underwent a hepatic parenchymal biopsy. MR-PDFF and MR spectroscopy were performed on all patients using a 3.0-T scanner. Following whole-volume segmentation of the MRPDFF images, 833 radiomic features were analyzed using a commercial program. Radiologic features were analyzed, including median and mean values of the multiple regions of interest and variable clinical features. A random forest regressor was used to extract the important radiomic, radiologic, and clinical features. The model was trained using 20 repeated 10-fold cross-validations to classify the NAFLD steatosis grade. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was evaluated using a classifier to diagnose steatosis grades.Results: The levels of pathological hepatic steatosis were classified as low-grade steatosis (grade, 0–1; n = 82) and high-grade steatosis (grade, 2–3; n = 24). Fifteen important features were extracted from the radiomic analysis, with the three most important being wavelet-LLL neighboring gray tone difference matrix coarseness, original first-order mean, and 90th percentile. The MR spectroscopy mean value was extracted as a more important feature than the MR-PDFF mean or median in radiologic measures. Alanine aminotransferase has been identified as the most important clinical feature. The AUROC of the classifier using radiomics was comparable to that of radiologic measures (0.94 ± 0.09 and 0.96 ± 0.08, respectively).Conclusion: MR-PDFF-derived radiomics may provide a comparable alternative for grading hepatic steatosis in patients with suspected NAFLD."

Machine Learning Methods to Predict Vehicle Fuel Consumption,2022,,,"It's proposed and analyzed ML(Machine Learning) models to predict vehicle FC(Fuel Consumption) in real-time. The test driving was done for a car to measure vehicle speed, acceleration, road gradient and FC for training dataset. The various ML models were trained with feature data of speed, acceleration and road-gradient for target FC. There are two kind of ML models and one is regression type of linear regression and k-nearest neighbors regression and the other is classification type of k-nearest neighbors classifier, logistic regression, decision tree, random forest and gradient boosting in the study. The prediction accuracy is low in range of 0.5 ~ 0.6 for real-time FC and the classification type is more accurate than the regression ones. The prediction error for total FC has very low value of about 0.2 ~ 2.0% and regression models are more accurate than classification ones. It's for the coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) of accuracy score distributing predicted values along mean of targets as the coefficient decreases.

This multicenter cohort study investigated the clinicoradiological characteristics relevant to the differential diagnosis of such lesions.Materials and Methods: From June to September 2015, 4787 thyroid nodules (≥ 1.0 cm) with a final diagnosis of benign follicular nodule (BN, n = 4461), follicular adenoma (FA, n = 136), follicular carcinoma (FC, n = 62), or follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC, n = 128) collected from 26 institutions were analyzed. The clinicoradiological characteristics of the lesions were compared among the different histological types using multivariable logistic regression analyses. The relative importance of the characteristics that distinguished histological types was determined using a random forest algorithm.Results: Compared to BN (as the control group), the distinguishing features of follicular-patterned neoplasms (FA, FC, and FVPTC) were patient’s age (odds ratio [OR], 0.969 per 1-year increase), lesion diameter (OR, 1.054 per 1-mm increase), presence of solid composition (OR, 2.255), presence of hypoechogenicity (OR, 2.181), and presence of halo (OR, 1.761) (all p < 0.05). Compared to FA (as the control), FC differed with respect to lesion diameter (OR, 1.040 per 1-mm increase) and rim calcifications (OR, 17.054), while FVPTC differed with respect to patient age (OR, 0.966 per 1-year increase), lesion diameter (OR, 0.975 per 1-mm increase), macrocalcifications (OR, 3.647), and non-smooth margins (OR, 2.538) (all p < 0.05). The five important features for the differential diagnosis of follicular-patterned neoplasms (FA, FC, and FVPTC) from BN are maximal lesion diameter, composition, echogenicity, orientation, and patient’s age. The most important features distinguishing FC and FVPTC from FA are rim calcifications and macrocalcifications, respectively.Conclusion: Although follicular-patterned lesions have overlapping clinical and radiological features, the distinguishing features identified in our large clinical cohort may provide valuable information for preoperative distinction between them and decision-making regarding their management."

One set comprised 62 easily accessible examination results of commonly used variables from a tertiary university hospital. The second set comprised 27 of the 62 variables included in the national routine health checkups. Gradient boosting and random forest algorithms were used to develop the models. Internal validation was performed using the stratified 10-fold cross-validation method.Results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) for the 62-variable DM model making 12-month predictions for subjects without diabetes was the largest (0.928) among those of the eight DM prediction models. The ROC-AUC dropped by more than 0.04 when training with the simplified 27-variable set but still showed fairly good performance with ROC-AUCs between 0.842 and 0.880. The accuracy was up to 11.5% higher (from 0.807 to 0.714) when fasting glucose was included.Conclusion: We created easily applicable diabetes prediction models that deliver good performance using parameters commonly assessed during tertiary university hospital and national routine health checkups.

Nine types of PQ events consisting of single and multi-stage disturbances are considered for study. For this task, features observed in the time frequency ( t , f ) plane have been used. Synthetic PQ events are generated using mathematical models. These signals are then projected in the time-frequency plane via the ST with a Compact Support Kernel (ST-CSK) providing the time-frequency resolution, energy concentration and robustness to noise. In this plane, PQ events are localized and characterized. The extracted features are then classifi ed using several technics. The achieved results show that an overall accuracy of 100% has been obtained with Support Vector Machines and Random Forest classifi ers even with signals embedded in high Additive White Gaussian Noise level ( SNR = 5 dB ). In the same conditions, XGboost classifi er accurately detects 99.72% of PQ events."

However, only complex and expensive manufacturing methods such as fine pattern alignment technology have been considered. To replace the existing smart sensor, which has to go through a complicated process, a new approach including a simple piezoresistive patch based on artificial intelligence has been suggested. Specifically, a 16-electrode terminal was connected to the edge of a polydimethylsiloxane pad where multi-walled carbon nanotube sheets are well dispersed, and a voltage input to the center of the specimen. The collected data was calculated using a voltage divider circuit to collect the voltage data. 54 random positions were marked on the pad. 4 positions were configured as the validation data set and 50 positions as the training data set. We examined whether it was possible to determine points in untrained positions using a deep neural network (DNN) and 12 different machine learning (ML) algorithms. The result of a deep neural network for untrained point location identification was MSE: 0.00026, R2: 0.991158, and the result of Random Forest, an ensemble model among ML algorithms, was MSE: 0.00845, R2: 0.971239.

유사도를 활용한 맞춤형 보험 추천 시스템,2022,,,"The data mainly used for the model are as follows: the personal information, the information of insurance product, etc. With the data, we suggest three types of models: content-based filtering model, collaborative filtering model and classification models-based model. The content-based filtering model finds the cosine of the angle between the users and items, and recommends items based on the cosine similarity; however, before finding the cosine similarity, we divide into several groups by their features. Segmentation is executed by K-means clustering algorithm and manually operated algorithm. The collaborative filtering model uses interactions that users have with items. The classification models-based model uses decision tree and random forest classifier to recommend items. According to the results of the research, the contents-based filtering model provides the best result. Since the model recommends the item based on the demographic and user features, it indicates that demographic and user features are keys to offer more appropriate items."

This study investigates some factors that may cause fluctuations in crude oil prices with macro variables as well as Google Trends Data. By employing data on oil demand and supply mainly used in forecasting models for WTI crude oil prices and trends on keywords highly searched during a period of a decline in oil prices, it analyzes whether it can improve forecasting power. We find that including Google Trends Data, besides data on oil demand and supply, can improve predictive ability over the sample period January 2004 to December 2020. To compare predictability in various models, we employ Adaptive LASSO, Ridge Regression, Random Forest, and LSTM. The results suggest that the LSTM model outperforms other models when both structured data and Google Trends Data are jointly used."

A panel of five optimal biomarkers, including CA125 and HE4, was verifiedin this study. These can potentially be used as clinical biomarkers for early detection of ovarian cancer."
Development and validation of interpretable machine learning models for inpatient fall events and electronic medical record integration,2022,"['Accidental falls', 'Machine learning', 'Patient safety', 'Nursing informatics']",,"Objective Falls are one of the most frequently occurring adverse events among hospitalized patients. The Morse Fall Scale, which has been widely used for fall risk assessment, has the two limitations of low specificity and difficulty in practical implementation. The aim of this study was to develop and validate an interpretable machine learning model for prediction of falls to be integrated in an electronic medical record (EMR) system.Methods This was a retrospective study involving a tertiary teaching hospital in Seoul, Korea. Based on the literature, 83 known predictors were grouped into seven categories. Interpretable fall event prediction models were developed using multiple machine learning models including gradient boosting and Shapley values.Results Overall, 191,778 cases with 272 fall events (0.1%) were included in the analysis. With the validation cohort of 2020, the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of the gradient boosting model was 0.817 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.720–0.904), better performance than random forest (AUROC, 0.801; 95% CI, 0.708–0.890), logistic regression (AUROC, 0.802; 95% CI, 0.721–0.878), artificial neural net (AUROC, 0.736; 95% CI, 0.650–0.821), and conventional Morse fall score (AUROC, 0.652; 95% CI, 0.570–0.715). The model’s interpretability was enhanced at both the population and patient levels. The algorithm was later integrated into the current EMR system.Conclusion We developed an interpretable machine learning prediction model for inpatient fall events using EMR integration formats."
Development of Mapping Function to Estimate Bond–Slip and Bond Strength of RC Beams Using Genetic Programming,2022,"['Bond strength', 'Bond–slip', 'Mapping', 'Genetic programming', 'Beam', 'Pull-out']",,"Bond–slip is an important characteristic that determines the stiffness, displacement, and load-bearing capacity of a reinforced concrete (RC) beam. It is essential for performing a precise numerical analysis of the beam. In most cases, bond–slip models can define the bond–slip curve only when there are experimental data. However, many bond test data have been obtained from pull-out tests, and the dominant view is that the bond–slip behavior observed in the pull-out test is quite different from that in an actual RC beam. Therefore, a mapping function that makes it possible to estimate the bond–slip behaviors of beam specimens using those of pull-out specimens was developed in this study. A total of 255 pull-out specimen data and 75 beam specimen data were collected from previous studies, and the importance and influence of each feature of the two groups were analyzed using random forest and K-means clustering. The mapping function was derived using genetic programming, and its accuracy was verified through a comparison with existing models. The proposed model exhibits a high degree of accuracy in estimating bond–slip and bond strength in beam specimens and can provide useful information for understanding the difference in bond–slip behaviors between the two groups."
Failure Mode Detection of Reinforced Concrete Shear Walls Using Ensemble Deep Neural Networks,2022,"['deep neural network', 'failure mode', 'shear wall', 'classification']",,"Reinforced concrete structural walls (RCSWs) are one of the most efficient lateral force-resisting systems used in buildings, providing sufficient strength, stiffness, and deformation capacities to withstand the forces generated during earthquake ground motions. Identifying the failure mode of the RCSWs is a critical task that can assist engineers and designers in choosing appropriate retrofitting solutions. This study evaluates the efficiency of three ensemble deep neural network models, including the model averaging ensemble, weighted average ensemble, and integrated stacking ensemble for predicting the failure mode of the RCSWs. The ensemble deep neural network models are compared against previous studies that used traditional well-known ensemble models (AdaBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) and traditional machine learning methods (Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest). The weighted average ensemble model is proposed as the best-suited prediction model for identifying the failure mode since it has the highest accuracy, precision, and recall among the alternative models. In addition, since complex and advanced machine learning-based models are commonly referred to as black-box, the SHapley Additive exPlanation method is also used to interpret the model workflow and illustrate the importance and contribution of the components that impact determining the failure mode of the RCSWs."

To date, however, there have been no simple and widely available screening tools that assess general mental health. Therefore, we sought to conduct a preliminary study for the development of a general mental health screening tool that can easily detect mental health problems at home.Methods We administered nine self-report questionnaires and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale to 143 patients with psychosis, a typical mental illness, 125 subjects with a clinical high-risk for psychosis, a representative group with non-specific psychiatric symptoms such as depression or anxiety, and 118 healthy subjects as controls. A machine learning approach was used to identify a set of items that optimally predicted the GAF scores. A model was trained using the random forest algorithm, and the set limit was measured through ABC analysis to select the final set of questionnaire items.Results The results showed that 12 items from four questionnaires were included in the function prediction model; the Positive and Negative Affect Scale 1, 8, 17, 19, the Beck Depression Inventory 6, 14, the Symptom Checklist 3, 5, 15, 20, and the Affect Intensity Measure 39. The average mean squared error, which is representative of model performance, was 879.07.Conclusion These results suggest that these 12 self-report items could comprise a simple and easy mental health screening tool. We propose to conduct a follow-up study on a large general population to validate the clinical usefulness of this preliminary screening tool."

For this purpose, we developed a deep-learning-based pediatric early-warning system (pDEWS) and aimed to validate its clinical performance. Methods: This is a retrospective multicenter cohort study including five tertiary-care academic children’s hospitals. All pediatric patients younger than 19 years admitted to the general ward from January 2019 to December 2019 were included. Using patient electronic medical records, we evaluated the clinical performance of the pDEWS for identifying deterioration events defined as in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) and unexpected general ward-to-pediatric intensive care unit transfer (UIT) within 24 hours before event occurrence. We also compared pDEWS performance to those of the modified pediatric early-warning score (PEWS) and prediction models using logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF).   Results: The study population consisted of 28,758 patients with 34 cases of IHCA and 291 cases of UIT. pDEWS showed better performance for predicting deterioration events with a larger area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, fewer false alarms, a lower mean alarm count per day, and a smaller number of cases needed to examine than the modified PEWS, LR, or RF models regardless of site, event occurrence time, age group, or sex. Conclusions: The pDEWS outperformed modified PEWS, LR, and RF models for early and accurate prediction of deterioration events regardless of clinical situation. This study demonstrated the potential of pDEWS as an efficient screening tool for efferent operation of rapid response teams."

머신러닝 기반 MMS Point Cloud 의미론적 분할,2022,"['Machine learning', 'Mobile mapping system', 'Point cloud', 'Semantic segmentation', 'High definition map']",,"The most important factor in designing autonomous driving systems is to recognize the exact location of the vehicle within the surrounding environment. To date, various sensors and navigation systems have been used for autonomous driving systems; however, all have limitations. Therefore, the need for high-definition (HD) maps that provide high-precision infrastructure information for safe and convenient autonomous driving is increasing. HD maps are drawn using three-dimensional point cloud data acquired through a mobile mapping system (MMS). However, this process requires manual work due to the large numbers of points and drawing layers, increasing the cost and effort associated with HD mapping. The objective of this study was to improve the efficiency of HD mapping by segmenting semantic information in an MMS point cloud into six classes: roads, curbs, sidewalks, medians, lanes, and other elements. Segmentation was performed using various machine learning techniques including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and gradient-boosting machine (GBM), and 11 variables including geometry, color, intensity, and other road design features. MMS point cloud data for a 130-m section of a five-lane road near Minam Station in Busan, were used to evaluate the segmentation models; the average F1 scores of the models were 95.43% for RF, 92.1% for SVM, 91.05% for GBM, and 82.63% for KNN.

Therefore, it is required enhanced management for appropriate operation. Although water-level tracking is necessary through continuous monitoring, it is challenging to measure and observe on-site due to practical problems. This study presents an objective comparison between multiple AI models for water-body extraction using radar images that have the advantages of wide coverage, and frequent revisit time. The proposed methods in this study used Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, and unlike common methods of water extraction based on optical images, they are suitable for long-term monitoring because they are less affected by the weather conditions. We built four AI models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) using drone images, sentinel-1 SAR and DSM data. There are total of 22 reservoirs of less than 1 million tons for the study, including small and medium-sized reservoirs with an effective storage capacity of less than 300,000 tons. 45 images from 22 reservoirs were used for model training and verification, and the results show that the AutoML model was 0.01 to 0.03 better in the water Intersection over Union (IoU) than the other three models, with Accuracy=0.92 and mIoU=0.81 in a test. As the result, AutoML performed as well as the classical machine learning methods and it is expected that the applicability of the water-body extraction technique by AutoML to monitor reservoirs automatically."

Big data of spatial information were generated, from which the physical and environmental status of structures and data of satellite images were reflected. Big data of urban space were generated based on 230 regions in South Korea for developing a building disaster prediction model. The generated big data of spatial information as well as the history of structural damages to structures due to torrential rain, strong wind, heavy snow, and typhoons from 2008 to 2017 were utilized in creating the disaster prediction model. The collected variables were applied in a random forest model, which are machine learning approaches, to develop the structure disaster prediction model. Looking at the importance of variables, in heavy rain, it was found that the precipitation intensity, semi-underground buildings, the threshold of the heavy rain, the frequency of occurrence of the threshold of the heavy rain, and the status of underground buildings had the greatest influence on the damage to buildings due to heavy rain. In the case of strong winds, the higher the normalized city index, steep slope, and poor drainage, the greater the influence. In heavy snow, the number of days of new snow exceeding 20 cm, hazardous materials treatment and storage facilities, average height, and old buildings had the greatest impact on disasters."

Machine learning models show good performance in various fields, while the process of model development requires considerable labor and time by experts. Automated machine learning(auto ML) is an emerging field of machine learning study. Auto ML is used to develop machine learning models while minimizing the time and labor required in the model development process. This study developed an auto ML to predict Chl-a using auto sklearn, one of most widely used open source auto ML algorithms. The model performance was compared with other two popular ensemble machine learning models, random forest(RF) and XGBoost(XGB). The model performance was evaluated using three indices, root mean squared error, root mean squared error-observation standard deviation ratio(RSR) and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency. The RSR of auto ML, RF, and XGB were 0.659, 0.684 and 0.638, respectively. The results shows that auto ML outperforms RF, and XGB shows better prediction performance than auto ML, while the differences between model performances were not significant. Shapley value analysis, an explainable machine learning algorithm, was used to provide quantitative interpretation about the model prediction of auto ML developed in this study.

The ratio of each material required for concrete is determined through the mixing design, but the strength of concrete cannot be known until experimentally measured. To overcome this limitation, many studies have used statistical mathematics and machine learning algorithms to predict the compressive strength of concrete using data obtained through experiments. Previous studies have proposed neural networks for predicting the compressive strength of concrete, but they are computationally expensive and difficult to apply in practice. As various regression models have been recently developed, a concrete strength prediction model was presented using recently developed regression models instead of a neural network with low computational efficiency. First, an optimal model was selected by the cross-verification procedure for the regression analysis models. Hyper-parameters of each selected model were optimized through grid search, and machine learning models were trained. The models that showed excellent performance in predicting the concrete compressive strength were CatBoost Regression(CatBoost), LGBM Regression(LGBMR), Random Forest Regression(RFR), and XGBoost Regression (XGBoost) models. The XGBoost regression model had the lowest error and best accuracy. The LGBM model, which shows lower performance, is better than the neural networks and ensemble models proposed in previous studies. The compressive strength prediction for ready-mixed concrete was also good, confirming the field applicability of these models."

Game bots can obtain in-game goods and items more easily than normal players and are not affected by realistic restrictions such as sleep time and character manipulation fatigue. As a result, there is a difference in harvesting coordinates between normal players and game bots. We divided the coordinate zones and used these coordinate zone differences to distinguish between game bot players and normal players.

However this method is difficult to evaluate fatigue in real time in daily life. This paper is a study on the fatigue classification model that determines the fatigue level of workers in real time using speech data recorded in the field. Machine learning models such as logistic classification, support vector machine, and random forest are trained using speech data collected in the field.

Rainfall and water level data from 2008 to 2020 were collected for the watershed. A total of 40 rainfall events were identified when the water level was 1m or higher from June to September, corresponding to the flood season. Additionally, flood water level forecasting was performed using AI-based models such as deep neural network (DNN), long short term memory (LSTM), and storage function models. Predictive power evaluation revealed the DNN model displayed the lowest normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) with a value of 0.06. This study concludes that there are issues with the existing flood warning and heavy rain warning standards due to rainfall variability, correlation with the occurrence of damage caused by heavy rain, and the application of consistent standards nationwide. To solve this issue, the cause of flood damage was classified and the risk assessment criteria established by linking the water level and rainfall data. To develop an optimal flood damage classification prediction model based on the established criteria, two models were applied: XGBoost and random forest model. Evaluation of model predictive power revealed the F1-score for XGBoost was 0.92, indicating excellent predictive power. Based on the models presented herein, the flood damage assessment technique using the results of flood prediction can be used as basic data for disaster managers’ decision-making."

In this work, we assessed status-quo performance of the Yongdam Dam in Korea under various climatic stresses in flood risk reduction and water supply reliability for 2021-2040. To this end, we employed a decision-centric framework equipped with a stochastic weather generator, a conceptual streamflow model, and a machine-learning reservoir operation rule. By imposing 294 climate perturbations to dam release simulations, we found that the current operation rule of the Yongdam dam could redundantly secure water storage, while inefficiently enhancing the supply reliability. On the other hand, flood risks were likely to increase substantially due to rising mean and variability of daily precipitation. Here, we argue that the current operation rules of the Yongdam Dam seem to be overly focused on securing water storage, and thus need to be adjusted to efficiently improve supply reliability and reduce flood risks in downstream areas."
인공지능 기반 빈집 추정 및 주요 특성 분석,2022,"['Vacant house prediction', 'Machine learning', 'XGBoost', 'LightGBM', 'Feature importance']",,"The extinction crisis of local cities, caused by a population density increase phenomenon in capital regions, directly causes the increase of vacant houses in local cities. According to population and housing census, Gunsan-si has continuously shown increasing trend of vacant houses during 2015 to 2019. In particular, since Gunsan-si is the city which suffers from doughnut effect and industrial decline, problems regrading to vacant house seems to exacerbate.This study aims to provide a foundation of a system which can predict and deal with the building that has high risk of becoming vacant house through implementing a data driven vacant house prediction machine learning model. Methodologically, this study analyzes three types of machine learning model by differing the data components. First model is trained based on building register, individual declared land value, house price and socioeconomic data and second model is trained with the same data as first model but with additional POI(Point of Interest) data. Finally, third model is trained with same data as the second model but with excluding water usage and electricity usage data.As a result, second model shows the best performance based on F1-score. Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine, XGBoost and LightGBM which are tree ensemble series, show the best performance as a whole. Additionally, the complexity of the model can be reduced through eliminating independent variables that have correlation coefficient between the variables and vacant house status lower than the 0.1 based on absolute value. Finally, this study suggests XGBoost and LightGBM based machine learning model, which can handle missing values, as final vacant house prediction model."
Artificial Intelligence Based Machine Learning Models Predict Sperm Parameter Upgrading after Varicocele Repair: A Multi-Institutional Analysis,2022,"['Artificial intelligence', 'Fertility', 'Patient-specific modeling', 'Sperm count', 'Varicocele']",,"Purpose: Varicocele repair is recommended in the presence of a clinical varicocele together with at least one abnormal semen parameter, and male infertility. Unfortunately, up to 50% of men who meet criteria for repair will not see meaningful benefit in outcomes despite successful treatment. We developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict which men with varicocele will benefit from treatment.Materials and Methods: We identified men with infertility, clinical varicocele, and at least one abnormal semen parameter from two large urology centers in North America (Miami and Toronto) between 2006 and 2020. We collected pre and postoperative clinical and hormonal data following treatment. Clinical upgrading was defined as an increase in sperm concentration that would allow a couple to access previously unavailable reproductive options. The tiers used for upgrading were: 1–5 million/mL (ICSI/IVF), 5–15 million/mL (IUI) and >15 million/mL (natural conception). Thus moving from ICSI/IVF to IUI, or from IUI to natural conception, would be considered an upgrade. AI models were trained and tested using R to predict which patients were likely to upgrade after surgery. The model sorted men into categories that defined how likely they were to upgrade after surgery (likely, equivocal, and unlikely).Results: Data from 240 men were included from both centers. A total of 45.6% of men experienced an upgrade in sperm concentration following surgery, 48.1% did not change, and 6.3% downgraded. The data from Miami were used to create a random forest model for predicting upgrade in sperm concentration. On external validation using Toronto data, the model accurately predicted upgrade in 87% of men deemed likely to improve, and in 49% and 36% of men who were equivocal and unlikely to improve, respectively. Overall, the personalized prediction for patients in the validation cohort was accurate (AUC 0.72).Conclusions: A machine learning model performed well in predicting clinically meaningful post-varicocelectomy sperm parameters using pre-operative hormonal, clinical, and semen analysis data. To our knowledge, this is the first prediction model to show the utility of hormonal data, as well as the first to use machine learning models to predict clinically meaningful upgrading. This model will be published online as a clinical calculator that can be used in the preoperative counseling of patients."

Methods: Data were collected from 571 adolescents enrolled in middle and high schools across the country, and betting behaviors were classified by level. After evaluating the performance of the machine learning algorithm using the R version 3.6.1 program, the relative importance of predictors for each level of youth betting behavior was analyzed using the optimal machine learning algorithm. Results: First, among the performance of the machine learning algorithm for predicting youth betting behavior, the random forest model showed optimal superiority when discriminating the non-problem vs the problem group. The gradient-boosting model was good at distinguishing between non-problem vs risk group and risk vs problem group. Second, among groups by level of betting behavior (non-problem group, risk group, problem group), the most important predictor variable to distinguish non-problem vs problem group, non-problem vs risk group was ‘accessibility to betting behavior’. The most important predictor variable to discriminate the risk vs the problem group was ‘over-immersion in expectation of betting behavior’. Conclusion: This study is meaningful in providing basic data for customized intervention strategies for each level of youth betting behavior by identifying the variables that best predict betting behavior by level by simultaneously inputting various predictive variables of youth betting behavior for the first time in Korea."
A Machine Learning-based Real-time Monitoring System for Classification of Elephant Flows on KOREN,2022,"['Software Defined Network (SDN)', 'Real-time monitoring', 'KOREN', 'NetFlow', 'Machine learning', 'Elephant flows']",,"With the advent and realization of Software Defined Network (SDN) architecture, many organizations are now shifting towards this paradigm. SDN brings more control, higher scalability, and serene elasticity. The SDN spontaneously changes the network configuration according to the dynamic network requirements inside the constrained environments. Therefore, a monitoring system that can monitor the physical and virtual entities is needed to operate this type of network technology with high efficiency and proficiency. In this manuscript, we propose a real-time monitoring system for data collection and visualization that includes the Prometheus, node exporter, and Grafana. A node exporter is configured on the physical devices to collect the physical and virtual entities resources utilization logs. A real-time Prometheus database is configured to collect and store the data from all the exporters. Furthermore, the Grafana is affixed with Prometheus to visualize the current network status and device provisioning. A monitoring system is deployed on the physical infrastructure of the KOREN topology. Data collected by the monitoring system is further pre-processed and restructured into a dataset. A monitoring system is further enhanced by including machine learning techniques applied on the formatted datasets to identify the elephant flows. Additionally, a Random Forest is trained on our generated labeled datasets, and the classification models’ performance are verified using accuracy metrics."
A multi-domain diagnostic framework for CRD fuel injection systems under water-in-diesel emulsion fuel conditions,2022,"['Common rail', 'Continuous wavelet transform', 'Short-time fourier transform', 'Spectral analysis', 'Fault detection and isolation', 'Water-emulsified diesel fuel']",,"From a global perspective, combustion emission from diesel engines has negatively impacted our environment as observed from the increasing global warming and other environmental pollution. In the quest for mitigating these consequences, diesel emulsification offers a cost-efficient and eco-friendly alternative but the corrosion, wear, and power loss effects on the engine pose a strong concern for global adoption. In the right proportions and mixing conditions, water-in-diesel (WiD) emulsion fuels can offer long-term solutions to reducing the number of combustion residuals-nitrogen oxides (Nox), particulate matter (PM), carbon oxides (COx) and with appropriate condition monitoring techniques in place, engine efficiency can be maintained. Interestingly, the rail pressure sensor (RPS) of a common rail (CR) diesel engine reflects the underlying transient and spectral dynamics in the CR system at varying engine speeds and WiD emulsion compositions and when properly harnessed can be used for condition monitoring/diagnosis. This paper proposes a machine learning (ML)-based diagnostic framework for CR diesel engines that functions on the use of continuous wavelet coefficients (CWCs) and short-time Fourier transform (STFT) outputs from the first-order derivatives of the RPS signals. Following an investigative experiment on a KIA Sorento 2004 four-cylinder line engine at various WiD emulsion compositions at various engine RPMs, diagnostic results show that exploring a multi-domain approach of feature extraction offers more discriminative diagnostic parameters thereby providing a wider perspective to condition monitoring and with the robustness of ML classifiers, accurate diagnostics can be achieved. A comparative assessment using global and local evaluation tools reveal the diagnostic performances of the ML algorithms and the trustworthiness of the most accurate model- random forest (RF) with a test accuracy of 96.65 % following a grid search against the other widely-used ML-based diagnostic tools."
데이터 마이닝 기법을 활용한 군용 항공기 비행 예측모형 및 비행규칙 도출 연구,2022,"['Data Mining', 'Big Data Analysis', 'Military Aircraft', 'Flight Scheduling', 'Meteorological Condition Data', 'Flight Decision', 'Aircraft Operation Readiness']",,"Purpose This paper aims to prepare a full operational readiness by establishing an optimal flight plan considering the weather conditions in order to effectively perform the mission and operation of military aircraft. This paper suggests a flight prediction model and rules by analyzing the correlation between flight implementation and cancellation according to weather conditions by using big data collected from historical flight information of military aircraft supplied by Korean manufacturers and meteorological information from the Korea Meteorological Administration. In addition, by deriving flight rules according to weather information, it was possible to discover an efficient flight schedule establishment method in consideration of weather information.Design/methodology/approach This study is an analytic study using data mining techniques based on flight historical data of 44,558 flights of military aircraft accumulated by the Republic of Korea Air Force for a total of 36 months from January 2013 to December 2015 and meteorological information provided by the Korea Meteorological Administration. Four steps were taken to develop optimal flight prediction models and to derive rules for flight implementation and cancellation. First, a total of 10 independent variables and one dependent variable were used to develop the optimal model for flight implementation according to weather condition. Second, optimal flight prediction models were derived using algorithms such as logistics regression, Adaboost, KNN, Random forest and LightGBM, which are data mining techniques. Third, we collected the opinions of military aircraft pilots who have more than 25 years experience and evaluated importance level about independent variables using Python heatmap to develop flight implementation and cancellation rules according to weather conditions. Finally, the decision tree model was constructed, and the flight rules were derived to see how the weather conditions at each airport affect the implementation and cancellation of the flight.Findings Based on historical flight information of military aircraft and weather information of flight zone. We developed flight prediction model using data mining techniques. As a result of optimal flight prediction model development for each airbase, it was confirmed that the LightGBM algorithm had the best prediction rate in terms of recall rate. Each flight rules were checked according to the weather condition, and it was confirmed that precipitation, humidity, and the total cloud had a significant effect on flight cancellation. Whereas, the effect of visibility was found to be relatively insignificant. When a flight schedule was established, the rules will provide some insight to decide flight training more systematically and effectively."
