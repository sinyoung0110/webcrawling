전장유전체 SNP 기반 decision tree를 이용한 누에 품종 판별,2022,"['Markers', 'silkworm varieties', 'SNP', 'T-ARMS']",,"Silkworms, which have recently shown promise as functional health foods, show functional differences between varieties; therefore, the need for variety identification is emerging. In this study, we analyzed the whole silkworm genome to identify 10 unique silkworm varieties (Baekhwang, Baekok, Daebaek, Daebak, Daehwang, Goldensilk, Hansaeng, Joohwang, Kumkang, and Kumok) using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) present in the genome as biomarkers. In addition, nine SNPs were selected to discriminate between varieties by selecting SNPs specific to each variety. We subsequently created a decision tree capable of cross-verifying each variety and classifying the varieties through sequential analysis. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was used for SNP867 and SNP9183 to differentiate between the varieties of Daehwang and Goldensilk and between Kumkang and Daebak, respectively. A tetra-primer amplification refractory (T-ARMS) mutation was used to analyze the remaining SNPs. As a result, we could isolate the same group or select an individual variety using the nine unique SNPs from SNP780 to SNP9183. Furthermore, nucleotide sequence analysis for the region confirmed that the alleles were identical. In conclusion, our results show that combining SNP analysis of the whole silkworm genome with the decision tree is of high value as a discriminative marker for classifying silkworm varieties."

In order to conduct a more precise analysis of the mixed-distributed physical health status of mixed-distributed adolescents, an appropriate Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM) was used. And a decision tree model was used to analyze branch paths. Using jamovi and R(ver.4.1.0)/R-studio as an analysis tool, the second year (2019) data of the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey 2018 panel data (2,590 first-year middle school students and 2,590 guardians) were analyzed. The research results are as follows. First, through GMM, the physical health of adolescents was classified into two different groups that were latent mixed, and they were named the healthy behavior cluster and unhealthy behavior cluster. Second, as a result of t-test for both clusters, the healthy behavior cluster was significantly higher except for youth activities and suburban club activities, which are factors outside the family, and whether or not the mother worked, which is an intrinsic factor in the family. Third, as a result of the decision tree to analyze the branch path that classifies healthy behavior and unhealthy behavior clusters of adolescents, the friend relationship and teacher relationship, which are external factors of the family, are positive, and the mother’s educational background, which is an intrinsic factor of the family, is positive. This high educational level was predicted to be classified as a healthy behavior cluster."

Speech emotion recognition based on genetic algorithm–decision tree fusion of deep and acoustic features,2022,"['decision tree model', 'deep neural network', 'feature fusion', 'GA', 'speech emotion recognition']",,"Although researchers have proposed numerous techniques for speech emotion recognition, its performance remains unsatisfactory in many application scenarios. In this study, we propose a speech emotion recognition model based on a genetic algorithm (GA)–decision tree (DT) fusion of deep and acoustic features. To more comprehensively express speech emotional information, first, frame-level deep and acoustic features are extracted from a speech signal. Next, five kinds of statistic variables of these features are calculated to obtain utterance-level features. The Fisher feature selection criterion is employed to select high-performance features, removing redundant information. In the feature fusion stage, the GA is is used to adaptively search for the best feature fusion weight. Finally, using the fused feature, the proposed speech emotion recognition model based on a DT support vector machine model is realized. Experimental results on the Berlin speech emotion database and the Chinese emotion speech database indicate that the proposed model outperforms an average weight fusion method."

Solar radiation forecasting using boosting decision tree and recurrent neural networks,2022,"['solar radiation', 'XGBoost', 'CatBoost', 'simple RNN', 'LSTM', 'GRU', 'time series cross-validation']",,"Recently, as the importance of environmental protection has emerged, interest in new and renewable energy is also increasing worldwide. In particular, the solar energy sector accounts for the highest production rate among new and renewable energy in Korea due to its infinite resources, easy installation and maintenance, and eco-friendly characteristics such as low noise emission levels and less pollutants during power generation. However, although climate prediction is essential since solar power is affected by weather and climate change, solar radiation, which is closely related to solar power, is not currently forecasted by the Korea Meteorological Administration. Solar radiation prediction can be the basis for establishing a reasonable new and renewable energy operation plan, and it is very important because it can be used not only in solar power but also in other fields such as power consumption prediction. Therefore, this study was conducted for the purpose of improving the accuracy of solar radiation. Solar radiation was predicted by a total of three weather variables, temperature, humidity, and cloudiness, and solar radiation outside the atmosphere, and the results were compared using various models. The CatBoost model was best obtained by fitting and comparing the Boosting series (XGB, CatBoost) and RNN series (Simple RNN, LSTM, GRU) models. In addition, the results were further improved through Time series cross-validation."

A study on Natural Disaster Prediction Using Multi-Class Decision Forest,2022,"['Natural disaster', 'Afghanistan', 'Azure Machine Learning', 'Muliclass Decision Forest']",,"In this paper, a study was conducted to predict natural disasters in Afghanistan based on machine learning. Natural disasters need to be prepared not only in Korea but also in other vulnerable countries. Every year in Afghanistan, natural disasters(snow, earthquake, drought, flood) cause property and casualties. We decided to conduct research on this phenomenon because we thought that the damage would be small if we were to prepare for it. The Azure Machine Learning Studio used in the study has the advantage of being more visible and easier to use than other Machine Learning tools. Decision Forest is a model for classifying into decision tree types. Decision forest enables intuitive analysis as a model that is easy to analyze results and presents key variables and separation criteria. Also, since it is a nonparametric model, it is free to assume (normality, independence, equal dispersion) required by the statistical model. Finally, linear/non-linear relationships can be searched considering interactions between variables. Therefore, the study used decision forest. The study found that overall accuracy was 89 percent and average accuracy was 97 percent. Although the results of the experiment showed a little high accuracy, items with low natural disaster frequency were less accurate due to lack of learning. By learning and complementing more data, overall accuracy can be improved, and damage can be reduced by predicting natural disasters."

The models adopted for performance assessment included decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB), which was fed by the data sets collected from two monitoring stations in the Nakdong River during 2018-2021. A 7:3 ratio was used to prepare training and testing sets for three prediction models and their hyperparmeters were tuned to improve the accuracy of prediction. We found that XGB which was not sensitive to input data resolution outperformed the other two models, DT and RF. In contrast, the prediction error for DT model decreased progressively in response to increasing monitoring frequency from 7 through 3 to 1 day as well as after applying post-pruning, regardless of dependent variables. When the accuracy of prediction for RF model was assessed as a function of the number of independent variables, more than 4 variables was effective in maintaining its prediction performance as compared to all variables adopted. Therefore, both monitoring frequency and pruning play an important role in reducing the prediction error of decision tree models, in addition to hyperparameter optimization."

The food exchange table is the standard for food exchange intake when composing a diet such as diet and diet, as well as patients who need nutritional management. The food exchange table, which is the standard for the composition of the diet, takes a lot of manpower and time in the process of revision through the National Health and Nutrition Survey, making it difficult to quickly reflect food changes according to new foods or trends. Since the proposed technique classifies newly added foods based on the existing food group, it is possible to organize a rapid food exchange table reflecting the trend of food. As a result of classifying food into the proposed model in the study, the accuracy of the food group in the food exchange table was 97.45%, so this food classification model is expected to be highly utilized for the composition of a diet that suits your taste in hospitals and nursing homes."

The empirical results are as follows. First, per capita GRDP, ratio of GRDP, and regional economic growth rate are found to have different characteristics with respect to the demographic structure. In particular, it is found that the population growth rate is important regardless of the type of GRDP. Second, it was found that the youth dependency ratio had a negative effect on per capita GRDP, but had a positive effect on the regional economic growth rate. Third, the proportion of the elderly population and the elderly dependency ratio have a positive effect on the regional economic growth rate, but have a negative effect on the proportion of the GRDP. These results imply that population growth has a positive effect on the local economy, and it suggests that it is very important to prepare measures for population growth, especially in non-metropolitan provinces where there is a high risk of local extinction.

These issues lead to increased construction period and cost, legal claims, and disputes. Especially, the design of a special tree is difficult for clients to perceive the description of the tree due to the limited experience and information. Consequently, designers have used representation tools such as 2D CAD or BIM to make their proposals easier for clients to understand more intuitive. However, existing representation tools require professional knowledge and the ability to imagine or shape the information, which intensifies difficulties in communication between practitioners and clients. Thus, more immersive realistic models in virtual-reality or mixed-reality environments are applied in the design review process to support decision-making. In this study, the mixed reality was introduced to determine whether it could be used as a representation tool while supporting the client’s special tree design decision-making. To verify this hypothesis, an experiment, about the installation of a special tree in the landscape design review phase, was conducted to compare mixed reality with the 2D CAD drawing plans, which is the representative design proposal representation. In addition, 12 questionnaires are classified by each category, understanding of space, understanding of greenery, and decision-making supporting. Mann-Whitney U test and paired t-test were conducted to analyze the significance between previous representation tools and mixed-reality about the understanding of space, design, and greenery. In addition, the correlation between understanding and decision-making support for landscape design review was analyzed by applying the Pearson correlation coefficient. As a result, it was found that mixed-reality is more intuitive and easier than 2D CAD drawings to understand essential information such as spatial, design, and scale information in the design review phase of a special tree. Even with the technical limitations of tactility visualization in mixed-reality, quick introduction of this innovative tool would support clients to determine the size and installation location of a special tree."

The purpose of this study is to find ICVP’s management plan reflecting users' usage and decision-making patterns. As a result of the analysis, the important variables influencing the decision-making for approval/release of affiliates are as follows. First, the subcategory criteria had a greater influence on decision making than the high/intermediate criteria. Second, the number of payment approvals and the amount of approval affect decision-making. Third, decision-making for online affiliates shows a relatively simple pattern compared to offline affiliates. Fourth, the decision-making process of affiliates classified into tourism (major classification level)-accomodations 1 (medium classification level)-accomodations 2 (minor class) was the most complex.

The Primary Process and Key Concepts of Economic Evaluation in Healthcare,2022,"['Economic evaluation', 'Medical cost', 'Quality-adjusted life year', 'Decision trees', 'Markov model', 'Incremental cost-effective ratio']",,"Economic evaluations in the healthcare are used to assess economic efficiency of pharmaceuticals and medical interventions such as diagnoses and medical procedures. This study introduces the main concepts of economic evaluation across its key steps: planning, outcome and cost calculation, modeling, cost-effectiveness results, uncertainty analysis, and decision-making. When planning an economic evaluation, we determine the study population, intervention, comparators, perspectives, time horizon, discount rates, and type of economic evaluation. In healthcare economic evaluations, outcomes include changes in mortality, the survival rate, life years, and quality-adjusted life years, while costs include medical, non-medical, and productivity costs. Model-based economic evaluations, including decision tree and Markov models, are mainly used to calculate the total costs and total effects. In cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analyses, cost-effectiveness is evaluated using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, which is the additional cost per one additional unit of effectiveness gained by an intervention compared with a comparator. All outcomes have uncertainties owing to limited evidence, diverse methodologies, and unexplained variation. Thus, researchers should review these uncertainties and confirm their robustness.

This work presents a detailed analysis associated with a comparison that includes several techniques based on pattern recognition for biasing fault detection in wheel and vehicle speed sensors. These techniques are K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM) and decision tree (DT), which were selected among other pattern recognition techniques that have been studied. The MATLAB Simulink model for the ABS system was implemented, and data was extracted from healthy and unhealthy operating conditions in order to be used to train each technique individually. An offline test was applied to these trained FDI models using the same implemented ABS Simulink model to express the performance of each one. Specifically speaking, accuracy and sensitivity were used in the algorithm’s efficiency comparison, with 99.9 % accuracy in the Fine KNN, 75 % accuracy in the Coarse Gaussian SVM, and 61.5 % accuracy in the Coarse Tree. From the result, and considering the ABS issues mentioned above, it can be concluded that the KNN classifier is superior to both the SVM and TREE classifiers."

We  applied  the Chapman-Richards equation model to estimate the site index of the Robinia pseudoacacia stand. The site index was distributed within the range of 16-22 when the base age was 30 years. The fitness index of the site index estimation model was low, but we judged that there was no problem in the application because the residual distribution of the equation had not shifted to one side. We used the Weibull diameter distribution function to determine the diameter distribution of the Robinia pseudoacacia stand by site index. We used the mean diameter and the dominant tree height as independent variables to present the diameter distribution, and our analysis procedure was to estimate and recover the parameters of the Weibull diameter distribution function. We used the mean diameter and the dominant tree height of the Robinia pseudoacacia stand to show distribution by diameter class, and the fitness index for dbh distribution estimation was about 80.5%. As a result of schematizing the diameter distribution by site indices as a 30-year-old, we found that the higher the site index, the more the curve of the diameter distribution moved to the right. This suggests that if the plantation were to be established in a high site index stand, considering the suitable trees on the site, the growth of Robinia pseudoacacia would become active, and not only the production of wood but also the production of  honey  would  increase.  We  therefore  anticipate  that  the  site  index  classification  table  and  curve  of  this  Robinia pseudoacacia stand will become the standard for decision making in the plantation and management of this tree."

During an e+e- collider process, a pair of B meson is created, one of which is regarded as a signal and reconstructed for analysis. The automatic reconstruction of the other B meson can enhance the quality of signal events by controlling information produced from another B meson. This technique is useful particularly when a complete reconstruction of signal B is impossible because of invisible particles are included in the decay mode such as neutrino. In utilizing automatic reconstruction, a ‘tagging’ method has been developed and used in B meson analyses. In this paper, we studied the tagging method of ‘other’ B meson using machine learning algorithms such as artificial neural networks and boosted decision trees. We also applied automatic reconstruction and checked its effect on the analysis of lepton-flavor-violating decay modes with simulation data. The result shows that automatic reconstruction effectively reduces background events and provides separation between signal and background."

Development and Validation of 18F-FDG PET/CT-Based Multivariable Clinical Prediction Models for the Identification of Malignancy-Associated Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis,2022,"['Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis', 'Malignancy', 'PET-CT', 'Diagnosis']",,"Objective: 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT is often used for detecting malignancy in patients with newly diagnosed hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), with acceptable sensitivity but relatively low specificity. The aim of this study was to improve the diagnostic ability of 18F-FDG PET/CT in identifying malignancy in patients with HLH by combining 18F-FDG PET/CT and clinical parameters.Materials and Methods: Ninety-seven patients (age ≥ 14 years) with secondary HLH were retrospectively reviewed and divided into the derivation (n = 71) and validation (n = 26) cohorts according to admission time. In the derivation cohort, 22 patients had malignancy-associated HLH (M-HLH) and 49 patients had non-malignancy-associated HLH (NM-HLH). Data on pretreatment 18F-FDG PET/CT and laboratory results were collected. The variables were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test or Pearson’s chi-square test, and a nomogram for predicting M-HLH was constructed using multivariable binary logistic regression. The predictors were also ranked using decision-tree analysis. The nomogram and decision tree were validated in the validation cohort (10 patients with M-HLH and 16 patients with NM-HLH).Results: The ratio of the maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the lymph nodes to that of the mediastinum, the ratio of the SUVmax of bone lesions or bone marrow to that of the mediastinum, and age were selected for constructing the model. The nomogram showed good performance in predicting M-HLH in the validation cohort, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.875 (95% confidence interval, 0.686–0.971). At an appropriate cutoff value, the sensitivity and specificity for identifying M-HLH were 90% (9/10) and 68.8% (11/16), respectively. The decision tree integrating the same variables showed 70% (7/10) sensitivity and 93.8% (15/16) specificity for identifying M-HLH. In comparison, visual analysis of 18F-FDG PET/CT images demonstrated 100% (10/10) sensitivity and 12.5% (2/16) specificity.Conclusion: 18F-FDG PET/CT may be a practical technique for identifying M-HLH. The model constructed using 18F-FDG PET/CT features and age was able to detect malignancy with better accuracy than visual analysis of 18F-FDG PET/CT images."

This research mainly aims to explore a new method and carry out the landslide susceptibility mapping based on terrain mapping unit (TMU) and grid cells mapping unit (GCMU) in Wuqi County, Yan’an City, China. Firstly, the landslide inventory map was prepared based on 717 landslides that were extracted. Secondly, the index of entropy model (IOE) was applied to quantify landslide predisposing factors based on TMU and GCMU, respectively. Finally, the systematicallydeveloped forest of multiple trees (SysFor) was integrated with IOE to construct a novel hybrid model (IOE-SysFor) and the landslide susceptibility maps based on TMU and GCMU were obtained. Statistical indices and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) were applied to evaluate the results and compare the approaches. From the results, it indicated that the accuracy of landslide susceptibility maps generated by the IOE-SysFor based on TMU and GCMU was satisfactory, furthermore, the performance of IOE-SysFor model running on the TMU was better than GCMU. Therefore, the TMU was considered as a more suitable landslide mapping unit for similar regions and the approach developed by this study can provide a reference for future researches."

Since customers increasingly rely on online reviews to search for more detailed information about products or services before purchasing, many researchers focus on detecting manipulated reviews. However, the main problem in detecting manipulated reviews is the difficulties with obtaining data with manipulated reviews to utilize machine learning techniques with sufficient data. Also, the number of manipulated reviews is insufficient compared with the number of non-manipulated reviews, so the class imbalance problem occurs. The class with fewer examples is under-represented and can hamper a model’s accuracy, so machine learning methods suffer from the class imbalance problem and solving the class imbalance problem is important to build an accurate model for detecting manipulated reviews. Thus, we propose an OpenAI-based reviews generation model to solve the manipulated reviews imbalance problem, thereby enhancing the accuracy of manipulated reviews detection. In this research, we applied the novel autoregressive language model -GPT-3 to generate reviews based on manipulated reviews. Moreover, we found that applying GPT-3 model for oversampling manipulated reviews can recover a satisfactory portion of performance losses and shows better performance in classification (logit, decision tree, neural networks) than traditional oversampling models such as random oversampling and SMOTE."

Methods: A decision-analytic Markov model was used to compare the cost-effectiveness of hospicepalliative care in an inpatient unit (inpatient-start group) and at home (home-start group).The model adopted a healthcare system perspective, with a 9-week horizon and a 1-week cycle length. The transition probabilities were calculated based on the reports from the Korean National Cancer Center in 2017 and Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service in 2020. Quality of life (QOL) was converted to the quality-adjusted life week (QALW).Modeling and cost-effectiveness analysis were performed with TreeAge software. The weekly medical cost was estimated to be 2,481,479 Korean won (KRW) for inpatient hospice- palliative care and 225,688 KRW for home-based hospice-palliative care. One-way sensitivity analysis was used to assess the impact of different scenarios and assumptions on the model results. Results: Compared with the inpatient-start group, the incremental cost of the home-start group was 697,657 KRW, and the incremental effectiveness based on QOL was 0.88 QALW. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the home-start group was 796,476 KRW/QALW. Based on one-way sensitivity analyses, the ICER was predicted to increase to 1,626,988 KRW/QALW if the weekly cost of home-based hospice doubled, but it was estimated to decrease to -2,898,361 KRW/QALW if death rates at home doubled. Conclusion: Home-based hospice-palliative care may be more cost-effective than inpatient hospice-palliative care. Home-based hospice appears to be affordable even if the associated medical expenditures double."

Input parameters were obtained from analyses of the National Health Insurance claims data, Korean HCV cohort data, or from the literature review. The population aged 40–65 years was simulated in a model spanning a lifetime from both the healthcare system and societal perspectives, which included the cost of productivity loss due to HCV-related deaths. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between universal screening and no screening was estimated.Results: The HCV screening strategy had an ICER of $2,666/QALY and $431/QALY from the healthcare system and societal perspectives, respectively. Both ICERs were far less than the willingness-to-pay threshold of $25,000/QALY, showing that universal screening was highly cost-effective compared to no screening. In various sensitivity analyses, the most influential parameters on cost-effectiveness were the antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) prevalence, screening costs, and treatment acceptance; however, all ICERs were consistently less than the threshold. If the anti-HCV prevalence was over 0.18%, screening could be cost-effective.Conclusions: One-time universal HCV screening in the Korean population aged 40–65 years using NHE program would be highly cost-effective from both healthcare system and societal perspectives."

Current benchmarking practices often face limitations rooted in the adopted methodologies. For instance, existing benchmark tools are based on the ordinary least squares regression method, which is highly sensitive to outliers and non-linearity in the dataset; this is likely to produce inaccurate benchmark scores. We propose a quantile regression benchmarking model reinforced with a gradient boosting decision tree algorithm (LightGBM). On the one hand, quantile regression analysis estimates the conditional distribution across quantiles, better capturing non-linearity in building energy behavior at various hierarchies of energy usage. On the other hand, the tree-based algorithm corrects previous errors during model training for better optimization. The said models were developed using a dataset from kindergarten school buildings in South Korea consisting of 3,090 buildings. From the developed models, it was observed that total floor area is a major determining factor in the electric energy use of kindergarten buildings in Korea, while the number of floors was also an energy driving factor in middle energy-consuming buildings. The proposed model provides accurate estimations of building energy performance, better facilitating energy comparison of a given building with its peers. The developed models provide valuable insights for energy conservation programs that might later inform building policies and for individuals wishing to reduce the energy consumption of their facilities."

It contributes to the increment of food and cash crop products through pollination services and protects and stabilizes fragile environments. The sector depends on floras to survive and produce honeybee products. Those plants were categorized as either nectar or pollen or both depending on their content. Assess the honeybee colony management practice and identification of honeybee flora intended to document the indigenous knowledge for the establishment of the best management decisions.Therefore, this study aimed to assess the honeybee colony management practices and identify the honeybee floras in eastern Amhara, Ethiopia. This study was conducted in the selected district of eastern Amhara based on the relative suitability and potential for beekeeping. A questionary survey was conducted for 122 beekeepers. Additionally, key informant interviews and honey pollen analysis were performed to support the questionary survey. The result of this study showed the beekeeper farmers had trouble with seasonal feed shortages for their honeybee colonies besides absconding and swarming were also prominent in the area.Furthermore, this study revealed that about 104 bee flora species were identified, which include shrubs, trees, herbs, and crops with the major proportion of shrubs. Most honeybee floras were perennial plants. Additionally, the seasonal bee forage fluctuation could be categorized into dearth, moderate, and honey flow season. The dearth period occurred from January- March and July-August. The moderate period was from April-June, and the honey flow period was from September-November. Therefore, seasonal management of the colonies should be adjusted with the dearth periods. Further study must be done about the frequency and density of the honeybee plants."
A Quantitative Analysis of the Little Red Riding Hood Types and Story Element-Function-Plot Relations,2022,"['Little Red Riding Hood', 'logistic regression', 'feature importance', 'story element', 'plot', 'motif']",,"Tale types of “Little Red Riding Hood” have survived through oral transmission in various areas including Europe, Africa, and Asia and can even be traced back to 10th century in a written form. This research presents quantitative analyses on the folkloric landscape of tales of, or related to, what is best known as Little Red Riding Hood through the Aarne-Thompson-Uther (ATU) index, of which we analyzed ATU 333, ATU 123, and other unspecified types, based on logistic regression and decision tree. The quantitative analyses of the Little Red Riding Hood tale types indicate that ATU 123 alone has the specific story segments that are important to the formation of the tale type and that though diversified in story segments and other details, the three types shared the distinct plot sequence as an important feature. In addition, eight event descriptors and six character and setting descriptors are found to be meaningful factors in the formation of ATU 123. It can be further argued that the plot as an abstraction played a major role in the formation of the tales we have now. Also demonstrated in this paper is that researchers can yield substantial insights into the quantitative results while cross-checking them with qualitative analyses."

Ⅳ장에서는 이러한 구조적 특징과 함께 다층 택소노미를 구성하는 기반체계(Tier 1)와 추가표준(Tier 2)의 구체적인 내용에 대해 설명한다. Ⅴ장에서는 아세안 택소노미에 따라 녹색, 황색, 적색으로 분류될 수 있는 경제활동의 사례를 제시하고, 특히 논란이 되고 있는 천연가스 발전과 원자력 발전에 대한 아세안 택소노미의 태도를 확인한다.아세안 택소노미의 특징을 효과적으로 설명하려면 다른 택소노미와 비교하는 작업이 필요하다. 이 글에서는 아세안 택소노미와 한국형 녹색분류체계 및 EU 택소노미의 유사점과 차이점을 짚어본다. 또한 말레이시아와 싱가포르의 택소노미는 아세안 택소노미에 직접적인 영향을 미쳤으므로 양자의 주목할 부분도 함께 살펴본다.아세안 택소노미의 기반체계는 말레이시아 택소노미와 유사하며 모든 분야의 경제활동을 단일한 결정트리에 따라 분류한다. 반면에 추가표준은 EU, 한국, 싱가포르 택소노미와 같이 활동별 심사기준을 사용하여 특정한 분야의 경제활동을 평가한다. 아세안 택소노미가 신호등 체계를 도입하여 전환 활동의 범주를 추가한 것은 말레이시아, 싱가포르 택소노미와 동일하다. 아세안 택소노미가 다른 택소노미들과 차이가 있는 부분은 인권과 노동의 측면에서 최소한의 보호장치를 고려하지 않는다는 것이다.아세안 택소노미에는 ‘지속가능금융을 위한’이라는 수식어가 붙어있다. 그러나 이번에 발표된 버전 1은 여러 환경목표 중에서도 기후변화 완화에 초점을 맞추고 있다.

Southeast Asia is especially vulnerable to climate change. ASEAN is expected to play an important role in global response to climate change considering its economic size and growth rate. At international, regional and national levels, ASEAN has declared its commitment to respond to the climate crisis. To transform the ASEAN economy to be compatible with such commitments and the Paris Agreement, private capital must be financed for green economic activities at large scale.After the Joint Meeting of the ASEAN Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (AFMGM) emphasized the importance of sustainable finance, four ASEAN sectoral bodies established the ASEAN Taxonomy Board (ATB). The ATB announced “ASEAN Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance – Version 1”(ASEAN Taxonomy) on November 10, 2021. The ASEAN Taxonomy aims to help issuers and investors understand the sustainability impact of projects and economic activities in the region and make informed and efficient decisions.This article explains the development history (Chapter II), purposes and characteristics (Chapter III), contents (Chapter IV) and applications (Chapter V) of the ASEAN Taxonomy. The main features that distinguish the ASEAN Taxonomy from other taxonomies are its multi-tiered structure and traffic light system. Chapter Ⅳ explains these structural features and detailed contents of the Foundation Framework (Tier 1) and Plus Standard (Tier 2) constituting the multi-tiered taxonomy. Chapter V presents examples of economic activities that can be classified into Green, Amber, and Red according to the ASEAN Taxonomy, and reviews its attitude toward the controversial issues of natural gas and nuclear power.The characteristics of the ASEAN Taxonomy become more apparent when it is compared with other taxonomies. This article examines the similarities and differences between the ASEAN Taxonomy, the Korean Green Taxonomy, and the EU taxonomy. Notable aspects of Singaporean and Malaysian taxonomies will also be explained as these regulations had significant influence over the ASEAN Taxonomy.The Foundation Framework of the ASEAN Taxonomy is similar to Malaysia’s taxonomy and classifies economic activities in all sectors with a single decision tree. On the other hand, the Plus Standard evaluates economic activities in specific sectors using activity-level screening criteria like the taxonomies of EU, Korea, and Singapore. The ASEAN Taxonomy adopted a traffic light system and added the category of transition activities, which can be found in the taxonomies of Malaysia and Singapore. The ASEAN Taxonomy is different from other taxonomies in that it does not consider the minimum safeguards in terms of human rights and labor.The title of the ASEAN Taxonomy includes the phrase of “for sustainable finance.” However, the Version 1 of the ASEAN Taxonomy focuses on climate change mitigation, among other environmental goals. The ATB stated that the next versions of the ASEAN Taxonomy will move on to other sustainability aspects. There are also many areas to be further developed with regard to the content of its classification system. It is anticipated that the ASEAN Taxonomy will solve the challenges step by step in coordination with other taxonomies in and out of the region and successfully contribute to ASEAN's response to climate change."

First, it discussed the adoption of the '2022 Revised Educational Curriculum (Draft)' in terms of the goals of teaching and learning the Chinese vocabulary for the 4th Industrial Revolution. The goals of teaching and learning are ‘Imagination, Communication, Knowledge, and Individual Competencies’ which include the 'Four Agenda for Future Minds' adopted by the World Economic Forum(WEF 2016).I reinterpreted the four agenda as ‘Imagination: Nurturing Creativity through Imagination,’ ‘Communication: Nurturing the Ability to Communicate and Cooperate with Others,’ ‘Knowledge: Nurturing the Ability to Use New Knowledge and New Technology,’ and ‘Individual Competency: Nurturing the Potential Capacity of Individual’ to discuss the goals of teaching and learning the Chinese vocabulary. The four agenda of ‘Imagination, Communication, Knowledge, and Individual Capacity’ discussed here are linked to the six core capacities suggested in the ‘2022 Revised Educational Curriculum(Draft).’ In other words, ‘Imagination’ becomes the direction of teaching and learning for nurturing ‘creative thinking capacity,’ ‘Communication’ for ‘cooperative communication capacity,’ ‘Knowledge’ for ‘knowledge and information processing capacity,’ and ‘Industrial Capacity’ for ‘self-management capacity,’ ‘aesthetic sensibility capacity,’ and ‘cooperative communication capacity,’ ‘community capacity.’ The study discussed the ways to apply the principles and technology of AI for teaching and learning the Chinese vocabulary in the Era of 4th Industrial Revolution. The principles and technology of AI are diverse and profound and not very easy to apply to academic learning. Therefore, the current study discussed the principles of decision tree and clustering that may be applied to the classrooms of elementary and middle schools. Also, the technologies using ‘Big Data’ and ‘Plickers’ were also applied to classroom curriculum.In order to establish the methodologies for curricular teaching and learning reflecting the new knowledge and new technology for the 4th Industrial Revolution, it is important for the instructors to learn the various new technologies based on IT for smooth application. I was not able to discuss the various methodologies of teaching and learning as I have limited knowledge in that area.

Fast Supplementary Voltage Control Strategy to Mitigate Catastrophic Trip-off Risk of Wind Turbines,2022,"['Wind turbine trip-off', 'Online early alarming', 'SVC fast supplementary voltage control', 'Decision tree']",,"There exists such a risk that Magnetic Control Reactor (MCR) type Static Var Compensator (SVC), which is widely used in wind farms, still outputs excessive reactive power after fault removal in the wind farm due to the slow regulating speed of MCR, leading to catastrophic trip-off problem of wind turbine. For the purpose of overcoming the shortage of MCR-type SVC on regulating speed and eff ectively controlling the transient over-voltage level of wind farm due to fault removal, an novel fast supplementary voltage control strategy for MCR-type SVC based on decision tree algorithm is proposed. The over-voltage level and trip-off risk of each wind turbine after fault removal is predicted by the proposed dynamic voltage security decision tree system. According to the predictions, appropriate capacitor banks are shed to lower the risk of wind turbine trip-off due to overvoltage, resulting from reactive power over-compensation. It can be proven with case studies that the proposed strategy is capable of reducing the risk of over-voltage in wind farms, accompanied by the excellent computational effi ciency."

Through this, it was confirmed that there are surplus and deprived areas for spatial elements, and based on these analysis results, social welfare implications for alleviating childrens emotional behavior problems were derived."
Insights gained from applying negate-down during quantification for seismic probabilistic safety assessment,2022,"['Seismic probabilistic safety assessment', 'Core damage frequency', 'Binary decision diagram', 'Minimal cutset upper bound', 'Delete-term approximation']",,"Approximations such as the delete-term approximation, rare event approximation, and minimal cutset upper bound (MCUB) need to be prudently applied for the quantification of a seismic probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) model. Important characteristics of seismic PSA models indicate that preserving the success branches in a primary seismic event tree is necessary. Based on the authors' experience in modeling and quantifying plant-level seismic PSA models, the effects of applying negate-down to the success branches in primary seismic event trees on the quantification results are summarized along with the following three insights gained: (1) there are two competing effects on the MCUB-based quantification results: one tending to increase and the other tending to decrease; (2) the binary decision diagram does not always provide exact quantification results; and (3) it is identified when the exact results will be obtained, and which combination provides more conservative results compared to the others. Complicated interactions occur in Boolean variable manipulation, approximation, and the quantification of a seismic PSA model. The insights presented herein can assist PSA analysts to better understand the important theoretical principles associated with the quantification of seismic PSA models"

Military is also making various efforts to improve Customer Waiting Time (CWT), that is an elapsed time from order to complete receipt. To ensure efficient military support, CWT is a core performance index in the defense sector. This study attempts to analyze factors affecting CWT, such as inventory holding position, natural environment (inland and island areas), and procurement type, using class 9(Spare parts) demands of Marine units. To this end, key factors are identified by applying regression models and decision tree techniques. As a result, influential factors are whether inventory is held or not, inventory holding position, and regional variables. Authorized Stockage List(ASL) and procurement types are not significant. In this study, among several models, the regression model that considers interaction effects of inventory holding position and regions was the most significant to predict CWT. According to the results of this study, it is necessary to review the selection of current CWT target since it focuses only on whether inventory is held and the type of procurement.

For this, we tried to examine whether, after implementation of the Free Semester System, middle-school students decided on the high-school type that they wished to be admitted to, not based on those like their academic achievement and top-raked high schools, but more based on those like their aptitude, interests, and career path or not. Methods Based on 2015 when the free semester system started in Gyeonggido, students were divided into two different groups; students who haven’t experienced the free semester system are classified as panel 1 (from 2012 to 2014) and students who experienced are panel 2 (from 2015 to 2017). Next, the decision factors were extracted for selecting the high school type, using the decision tree among the data-making techniques. Then the priority list was sequentially listed using random post analysis. Results According to the analysis results of random forest, the keyword list of panel 1 was presented in order of math score, English score, English proficiency test, monthly education cost, Korean language score. On the other hand, the keyword list of panel 2 was shown in order of English score, math score, self-efficiency, career planning, and Korean score. Conclusions The major determinant of high school type selection is students’ academic record regardless of operation of the free semester program. That is, it is verified that the free semester system doesn’t have any influence on high school type selection contrary to the purpose of the free semester system. We can say, However, the free semester system had a positive effectiveness on the choice of high school type because priority of a part of variables related to the free semester system(career planning, self-efficacy, reading activity, career self-understanding, subject-specific interests) has increased despite short-term implementation of the free semester system when we analyze the trend in priority influencing the choice of high school type."

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop an algorithm that can derive workflow for varioussentence types. To this end, text classification which matches a question to predefined workflows is used . To use textclassification, we need to select a corpus, label the corpus, extract feature which converts text into numbers, and trainthe classification models using the extracted feature. GeoAnQu, which is known to require various types of geospatialoperation workflows, was selected as a corpus and 23 workflows were derived by analyzing it. We then paraphrase itfor algorithm generalization verification and data augmentation and label it using 23 workflows. We performed corpusfeature extraction using TF-IDF that is based on statistical methodology. We trained linear SVM, decision tree, Multilayerperceptron classifier, and Naive Bayes classifier, and then selected the best performing linear SVM as the finalmodel. It was confirmed that the workflow for various sentence types can be derived through the model."
EMG Pattern Recognition Using TFD for Future Control of In-Car Electronic Equipment,2022,"['Electromyography', 'Time-frequency distribution', 'Spectrogram', 'Machine learning', 'Support vector machine', 'Pattern recognition']",,"Distracted drivers contribute to motor vehicle accidents. The maneuvering of in-car electronic equipment and controls, which typically requires the driver’s hands to be off the wheel and eyes off the road, are important factors that distract drivers. To minimize the interference of such distractions, a new control method is presented for detecting and decoding human muscle signals, which is known as electromyography (EMG). It is associated with various fingertips and pressures, and allows the mapping of various commands to control in-car equipment without requiring hands off the wheel. The most important step to facilitate such a scheme is to extract a highly discriminatory feature that can be used to separate and compute different EMG-based actions. The aim of this study is to accurately analyze EMG signals and classify finger movements that can be used to control in-car electronic equipment using a time–frequency distribution (TFD). The average root mean square voltage of seven participants and fourteen different finger movements are extracted as EMG features using a TFD. Four machine learning classifiers, i.e., support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, linear discriminant, and K-nearest neighbor (KNN), are used to classify pointing finger classes. The overall accuracy of the SVM precedes that of the other classifiers (89.3%), followed by decision tree (57.1%), linear discriminant (34.5%), and KNN (27.4%). The findings of this study are expected to be used in real-time applications that require both time and frequency information. Integrating the EMG signal to control in-car electronic equipment is expected to reduce the number of motor vehicle crashes globally."

Therefore, this study proposes a method of identifying ship types through the Random Forest Classifier (RFC) from dynamic and static data of AIS and V-Pass for one year and the Ulsan waters. With the hypothesis that six features, the speed, course, length, breadth, time, and location, enable to estimate of the ship type, four classification models were generated depending on length or breadth information since 81.9% of ships fully contain the two information. The accuracy were average 96.4% and 77.4% in the presence and absence of size information. The result shows that the proposed method is adaptable to identifying ship types."

Second, optimal flight prediction models were derived using algorithms such as logistics regression, Adaboost, KNN, Random forest and LightGBM, which are data mining techniques. Third, we collected the opinions of military aircraft pilots who have more than 25 years experience and evaluated importance level about independent variables using Python heatmap to develop flight implementation and cancellation rules according to weather conditions. Finally, the decision tree model was constructed, and the flight rules were derived to see how the weather conditions at each airport affect the implementation and cancellation of the flight.Findings Based on historical flight information of military aircraft and weather information of flight zone. We developed flight prediction model using data mining techniques. As a result of optimal flight prediction model development for each airbase, it was confirmed that the LightGBM algorithm had the best prediction rate in terms of recall rate. Each flight rules were checked according to the weather condition, and it was confirmed that precipitation, humidity, and the total cloud had a significant effect on flight cancellation.

머신러닝을 활용한 지역별 환경요소의 미세먼지 기여도 분석,2022,"['Particulate matter', 'Machine learning', 'Inland area', 'Costal area', 'Contribution']",,"The scope of this work was to characterize PM concentration in inland and coastal areas in Korea and to examine the relative contribution of the outdoor environment and time factor. The coastal area was designated as the case where there was a measuring station within 10 km of the coastline, and the other areas were defined as inland areas. PM10·PM2.5 concentrations and other environmental factors were all measured by the national measuring station in units of one hour in 2019. Through the prediction accuracy analysis by machine learning algorithm using these data, it was confirmed that the boosted decision tree had the highest accuracy in PM analysis, and the accuracy was lowered in PM10 and coastal areas due to factors that were not reflected in the feature such as sea salt. After that, by using variable weights derived from linear regression, we found the main causes of the PM concentration increase were PM precursor and the seasonal characteristics of winter and spring. And main causes of PM concentration decrease were dew point temperature, wind speed and direction. Also, the PM increase or decrease due to environmental variables was larger in the inland area than in the coastal area."

Machine Learning Methods to Predict Vehicle Fuel Consumption,2022,,,"It's proposed and analyzed ML(Machine Learning) models to predict vehicle FC(Fuel Consumption) in real-time. The test driving was done for a car to measure vehicle speed, acceleration, road gradient and FC for training dataset. The various ML models were trained with feature data of speed, acceleration and road-gradient for target FC. There are two kind of ML models and one is regression type of linear regression and k-nearest neighbors regression and the other is classification type of k-nearest neighbors classifier, logistic regression, decision tree, random forest and gradient boosting in the study. The prediction accuracy is low in range of 0.5 ~ 0.6 for real-time FC and the classification type is more accurate than the regression ones. The prediction error for total FC has very low value of about 0.2 ~ 2.0% and regression models are more accurate than classification ones. It's for the coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) of accuracy score distributing predicted values along mean of targets as the coefficient decreases.

For the transaction-based approach, the first model is primarily based on raw data features, while the second model uses extra features in addition to the first model. The user ID-based approach also used feature engineering to extract and transform the most relevant features.

To solve this problem, this study proposes a standing wave reflectometry method, which involves measuring the reflection coefficient by generating a frequency sweep signal and acquiring the magnitude of the reflected signal for each frequency. Defects were detected by comparing the reflection coefficients of a normal wiring harness and connector with those from the inspection. Experiments were conducted in both laboratory and driving environments. Following the reflection coefficients being classified into a decision tree, a true positive ratio of 99% and a false discovery rate of 1% were found for open faults."

Water temperature, turbidity, pH, conductivity, flow rate, alkalinity and pre-chlorination dosage data are used as the input parameters to develop prediction models. As results, it is presented that the random forest algorithm shows the most moderate prediction result among four cases, which are long short term memory, multi-layer perceptron, multiple regression including random forest. Especially, it is result that the multiple regression model can not represent the residual chlorine with the input parameters which varies independently with seasonal change, numerical scale and dimension difference between quantity and quality. For this reason, random forest model is more appropriate for predict water qualities than other algorithms, which is classified into decision tree type algorithm.

The data was preprocessed so that it could be applied to machine learning, and a model was built using five machine learning algorithms. Finally, by comparing the performance of the built models, the model with the highest performance was selected as the proposed model, and then 12 variables of the IMU sensor were applied one by one to analyze important variables affecting the learning performance.Results: As a result of comparing the performance of five machine learning algorithms (K-NN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Light GBM), the prediction accuracy of the Light GBM-based prediction model was higher than that of other algorithms. Using the Light GBM algorithm, which had excellent performance, an experiment was performed to rank the importance of variables that affect the direction prediction of the model.Conclusion: Among the five machine learning algorithms, the algorithm that best predicts the putting direction was the Light GBM algorithm. When the model predicted the putting direction, the variable that had the greatest influence was the left-right inclination (Roll)."
인공지능을 활용한 빈집 실태조사 효율화 방안에 관한 연구 : 군산시를 사례로,2022,"['Vacant house', 'Survey of Vacant Houses', 'Estimation', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Real Estate Policy']","최근 수도권 집중화 현상으로 인해, 지방 도시에서 빈집 수는 계속해서 증가하고 있다. 이에 정부는 빈집실태조사를 실시하고 있지만 사전조사의 정확도가 낮아 현장조사의 비용이 큰 실정이다. 따라서 빈집실태조사를 효율적으로 하기 위해서는, 사전조사 단계에서 빈집으로 의심되는 건축물들을 정확히 발견하고 이에 따른 후속 조치를 취하는 것이 필요하다. 본 연구에서는 빈집 조기 탐지에 도움을 줄 수 있도록 전기·상수도 사용량, 건축물 그리고 사회경제 변수 데이터를 활용해 인공지능을 통해 빈집 추정을 시도해 빈집실태조사의 효율성을 확대하고자 한다.","Due to the recent centralization of the metropolitan area, the number of vacant houses in local cities continues to increase. Accordingly, the government is conducting a survey on vacant houses, but the cost of on-site surveys is high due to the low accuracy of the preliminary survey. Therefore, in order to efficiently conduct an empty house survey, it is necessary to accurately find buildings suspected of empty houses in the preliminary survey stage and take follow-up measures accordingly. This study aims to expand the efficiency of the survey of vacant houses by attempting to estimate vacant houses through artificial intelligence by using data on electricity, water usage, buildings, and socioeconomic variables to help early detection of vacant houses. As a result, Decision Tree Ensemble Models showed the best performance based on Accuracy, F1-score, and AUC scores, and building data in addition to electricity usage were also identified as important variables in estimating empty houses."
Event-based White Blood Cell Classification from Nailfold Capillaries,2022,"['White blood cells', 'Nailfold capillary', 'Event-based data', 'Classification', 'Dynamic vision sensor']",,"Detecting absorption gaps in a nailfold capillary can be used to quantify an estimation of white blood cells (WBCs). Previously, the absorption gaps in a nailfold capillary were usually measured using a standard camera on a fingernail. However, difficulties arise due to low visibility of the gap, the small size of the capillaries, the high speed of WBC movement, and the lack of contrast between the capillary and its environment/background. To address these issues, an eventbased WBC image is utilized as input data to detect WBC existence in the nailfold. Specifically, we utilize a dynamic vision sensor (DVS) camera, which can detect a change in luminance on a pixel basis and can produce a stream of asynchronous event output at a microsecond temporal resolution.With the event-based WBC dataset, we conduct a classification task using three different machine learning algorithms: k-nearest neighbors, the decision tree, and random forest. The best result is from random forest with 75.51% accuracy. Based on our evaluation, event-based WBC classification is a promising new approach to detecting WBC presence in nailfold capillaries."

An effective automated ontology construction based on the agriculture domain,2022,"['agriculture', 'Naïve Bayes', 'natural language processing (NLP)', 'ontology', 'subdomain']",,"The agricultural sector is completely different from other sectors since it completely relies on various natural and climatic factors. Climate changes have many effects, including lack of annual rainfall and pests, heat waves, changes in sea level, and global ozone/atmospheric CO2 fluctuation, on land and agriculture in similar ways. Climate change also affects the environment. Based on these factors, farmers chose their crops to increase productivity in their fields. Many existing agricultural ontologies are either domain-specific or have been created with minimal vocabulary and no proper evaluation framework has been implemented. A new agricultural ontology focused on subdomains is designed to assist farmers using Jaccard relative extractor (JRE) and Naïve Bayes algorithm. The JRE is used to find the similarity between two sentences and words in the agricultural documents and the relationship between two terms is identified via the Naïve Bayes algorithm. In the proposed method, the preprocessing of data is carried out through natural language processing techniques and the tags whose dimensions are reduced are subjected to rule-based formal concept analysis and mapping. The subdomain ontologies of weather, pest, and soil are built separately, and the overall agricultural ontology are built around them. The gold standard for the lexical layer is used to evaluate the proposed technique, and its performance is analyzed by comparing it with different state-of-the-art systems. Precision, recall, F-measure, Matthews correlation coefficient, receiver operating characteristic curve area, and precision-recall curve area are the performance metrics used to analyze the performance. The proposed methodology gives a precision score of 94.40% when compared with the decision tree(83.94%) and K-nearest neighbor algorithm(86.89%) for agricultural ontology construction."

Prognosis of Alzheimer's Disease Progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment Using Apolipoprotein-E Genotype,2022,"['Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)', 'Mild cognitive impairment (MCI)', 'Apolipoprotein-E genotype', 'Support vector classifier', 'Random forest classifiers', 'DragonNN']",,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), cerebrovascular disease, Lewy-body disease, and Frontal–temporal degeneration disease are the age-related cognitive impairments that cause dementia. However, AD is the primary cause of dementia that causes brain cell degeneration in the geriatric community. Brain cell degeneration is the crucial cause of AD, due to the abnormal accumulation of indissoluble clumps known as plaques and tangles in the human brain's neurons. Amyloid precursor protein levels and Apolipoprotein -E gene are the biomarkers of AD since it causes accumulations and hence blocks the neuron transport system throughout the body. The early onset of AD includes mild-cognitive impairment (MCI) that progresses to complete dementia. Many related works include AD prediction using clinical modality images and cognitive assessments scores of the individuals but have not addressed comparative genome study for signifi cant subjects. However, there is a lack of aff ordable biomarkers for the eff ective early detection of high-risk individuals. In this study, we utilize one or more features of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) tests and Apolipoprotein-E genotype sequence that provides more signifi cant biomarkers for the early prediction. The ML classifi ers including Support vector classifi er, Gaussian process, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Decision trees learns the subset of patterns that predicts the AD with gene descriptors from microRNA expression profi le and the profi led gene pattern. These signifi cant multiple gene descriptors provide a supportive prediction methodology that apply genotype strength with the ensemble classifi ers. The fi nal optimal model is given by validation evaluations. The support vector classifi er and Random Forest classifi ers had given consistent results for disease conversion and progression from MRI attributes and had given promising results with the validation that showed accuracy greater than 80% and F1 weighted score of 0.8 in disease classifi cation and prognosis. The experimental results had proven 95% accuracy in the saliency values of APOE isoforms implemented in DragonNN framework that will vary AD pathogenic.

This provided basic data for preparing a traffic safety system for elderly drivers and establishing policies.METHODS : Based on machine learning, the major factors influencing accident severity (from the analysis of traffic accident data for elderly drivers) were analyzed and compared with existing statistical analysis results. The machine learning algorithm used the Scikit-learn library and Python 3.8. A hyperparameter optimization process was performed to improve the safety and accuracy of the model. To establish the optimal state of the model, the hyperparameters were set (K = 5) using K-fold cross-validation. The hyperparameter search applied the most widely utilized grid search method, and the performance evaluation derived the optimal hyperparameter value using neutral squared error indicators.RESULTS : The traffic laws, road sections of traffic accidents, and time zones of accidents were analyzed for accidents involving elderly drivers in Daejeon Metropolitan City, and the importance of the variables was examined. For the analysis, a linear regression model, machine learning-based decision tree, and random forest model were used, and based on the root mean square error, the random forest accuracy performance was found to be the best. Ultimately, 18 variables were analyzed, including traffic violations, accident time zones, and road types. The variables influencing the accident severity were the speed, signal violation, intersection section, late-night driving, and pedestrian protection violation, with the relative importance of the variables in the order of speed (0.3490966), signal violation (0.285967), and late-night driving (0.173108). These can be seen as variables related to the expansion of life damage owing to physical aging and reduced judgment abilities arising from decreases in cognitive function.CONCLUSIONS : Restricting the driving of the elderly on the expressway and at night is reasonable, but specific standards for driving restrictions should be prepared based on individual driving capabilities."

Available water quantity and quality data are collected and analyzed statistically to apply into mathematical multiple regression and artificial intelligence models including multi-layer perceptron neural network, random forest, long short term memory (LSTM) algorithms. Water temperature, turbidity, pH, conductivity, flow rate, alkalinity and pre-chlorination dosage data are used as the input parameters to develop prediction models. As results, it is presented that the random forest algorithm shows the most moderate prediction result among four cases, which are long short term memory, multi-layer perceptron, multiple regression including random forest. Especially, it is result that the multiple regression model can not represent the residual chlorine with the input parameters which varies independently with seasonal change, numerical scale and dimension difference between quantity and quality. For this reason, random forest model is more appropriate for predict water qualities than other algorithms, which is classified into decision tree type algorithm. Also, it is expected that real time prediction by artificial intelligence models can play role of the stable operation of residual chlorine in water treatment plant including pre-chlorination process."

(29)∼(32)구에서는 동래지역의 대표적인 명산인 금정산과 그 산에 암자를 창건한 원효에 대해서 언급했고, (33) ∼(34)구에서는 자신에 앞서 이곳 동래로 유배와 임금에 대한 그리움을 노래한 정서의정과정곡을 떠올리기도 했다. (35)∼(36)구에서는 끊임없이 흘러가는 강물과 항상 그대로인 듯 보이는 ‘江月松風’을 대비하며 세상의 무상함과 우리 삶의 유한함을 되돌아보았고, (37)∼(38)구에서는 평생토록 道를 배웠지만 동래 선인들과 같은 경지를 체득하지https://doi.org/10.31929/namdo.2022.46.7 8 남도문화연구 제46집(2022.8) 못한 것을 아쉬워했다.정추는 속세의 권력보다는 소박하고 유유자적한 삶을 추구했던 것 같다. 우선 <동래회고>가 현실에서의 이상향을 노래한 한유의 <도원도> 韻에 맞추었다는 점에서부터 그런 사실을 짐작할 수 있다. 또한 김겸효·금구선인과 같은 선인들 이외에도 승려인 원효까지 언급한 사실에서 정추의 출세간적인 성향을 살펴볼 수 있다.이보다 더 결정적인 것은 <동래회고>의 마지막 구절에서 정추가 古人이 가졌던 진리를 얻지 못한 자신을 반성하고 있다는 점이다. 여기서 ‘고인’은 ‘원효를 포함한 동래의선인들’이고 ‘고인이 가졌던 진리’는 ‘출세간적인 지혜’를 말하는 것이라고 볼 수 있다.","I am interested in and researching Korean literature written in Chinese characters in the neglected Busan and Dongrae regions, and this thesis was conceived as an extension of that.In this thesis, among the works of Jeong chu(1333∼1382), an early figure who sang Dongnae, I would like to examine the poem <Nostalgia of Dongnae>, which is thought to have compressed various aspects of Dongnae.｢Nostalgia of Dongnae｣ is a long poem with 7 words and 38 phrases.Jeong chu described the memories of Choi Chi-won and Haeundae in lines (1) to (14) of this poem, and in lines (15) to (28), the representative Seon-in(仙人)-Taoist hermit with miraculous powers-of Dongnae such as Kim Gyeom-hyo·So-ha and Geum Gu-seon-in and their trail.Lines (29)∼(32) mentioned Mt. Geumjeongsan(金井山), a representative mountain of the Dongnae region, and Wonhyo(元曉), who built a hermitage on the mountain, and in the (33)∼(34) line, he also recalled the sentimental song <jeong-gwajeong-gog(鄭瓜亭曲)>, in which he sang longing for the king by coming into exile to Dongnae before himself.In the (35)∼(36) line, he looked back on the ephemeralness of the world 부산 동래의 기억 29 and the finiteness of our lives by contrasting the constantly flowing river water and the ever-present ‘River·moon·pine tree·wind’ and in the (37) ∼(38) line, he learned the Tao for the rest of his life, but regretted that he did not attain the same level as Dongnae Seon-in(仙人).Jeong Chu(鄭樞) seems to have pursued a simple and leisurely life rather than worldly power. First of all, this fact can be inferred from the fact that <Nostalgia of Dongnae(東萊懷古)> was adapted to Hanyu(韓愈)’s <Dowondo(桃源圖)>, which sang about an utopia in reality.In addition to the Seon-in(仙人) such as Kim Gyeom-hyo(金謙孝) and Geum Gu Seon-in(金龜仙人), the fact that Wonhyo(元曉), a monk, was mentioned, we can examine Jeong Chu(鄭樞)’s tendency to leave the world.More decisive than this is that in the last verse of <Nostalgia of Dongnae (東萊懷古)>, Jeong Chu(鄭樞) is reflecting on himself for not getting the truth that sage(古人) had. Here, ‘Sage(古人)’ means ‘Seon-in(仙人) of Dongnae including Wonhyo(元曉)’, and ‘The truth of sage(古人)’ refers to ‘Wisdom that transcends the world’."
