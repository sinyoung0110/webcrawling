Development and Application of Web-based Machine Learning Program for Automated Assessment Model Generation,2022,"['Constructed response assessment', 'artificial intelligence', 'machine learning', 'scoring model']",,"In order to enable customized learning using artificial intelligence, a scoring model that can evaluate students' responses is needed. Human-scored data and programming skills training artificial intelligence are required to generate scoring models. When teachers develop scoring models, it is very useful to secure many scoring models that can be used in schools. However, the biggest challenge for teachers to create scoring models is programming skills training artificial intelligence. Thus, in this study, we developed a web-based automatic assessment model generation program that can rapidly generate assessment models using graded descriptive responses using supervised learning, without programming. Web program development was created by dividing an analyzer, classifier, web development, and server for extracting features. By developing an assessment model with actual scored data using the developed program, it was determined that an assessment model is reliable. Using the developed program, teachers can create their assessments using scored data without prior programming experience. In addition, the developed program can be used to strengthen teachers' artificial intelligence capabilities."
Machine Learning과 Google Trends Data를 이용한 유가 예측 및 분석,2022,"['Google Trends Data', 'LSTM 모형', '유가 예측', 'Web scraping', 'LSTM model', 'forecasting oil prices', 'web scraping']",,"Forecasting crude oil prices is an important issue, especially for Korea which is the importer of crude oil, since fluctuations in crude oil prices may have a negative effect on the economy. This study investigates some factors that may cause fluctuations in crude oil prices with macro variables as well as Google Trends Data. By employing data on oil demand and supply mainly used in forecasting models for WTI crude oil prices and trends on keywords highly searched during a period of a decline in oil prices, it analyzes whether it can improve forecasting power. We find that including Google Trends Data, besides data on oil demand and supply, can improve predictive ability over the sample period January 2004 to December 2020. To compare predictability in various models, we employ Adaptive LASSO, Ridge Regression, Random Forest, and LSTM. The results suggest that the LSTM model outperforms other models when both structured data and Google Trends Data are jointly used."
Machine Learning Methods for Trust-based Selection of Web Services,2022,"['Users’ trust', 'machine learning', 'REPTree', 'fuzzy rules', 'trust prediction']",,"Web services instances can be classified into two categories, namely trusted and untrusted from users. A web service with high throughput (TP) and low response time (RT) instance values is a trusted web service. Web services are not trustworthy due to the mismatch in the guaranteed instance values and the actual values achieved by users. To perform web services selection from users' attained TP and RT values, we need to verify the correct prediction of trusted and untrusted instances from invoked web services. This accurate prediction of web services instances is used to perform the selection of web services. We propose to construct fuzzy rules to label web services instances correctly. This paper presents web services selection using a well-known machine learning algorithm, namely REPTree, for the correct prediction of trusted and untrusted instances. Performance comparison of REPTree with five machine learning models is conducted on web services datasets. We have performed experiments on web services datasets using a ten k-fold cross-validation method. To evaluate the performance of the REPTree classifier, we used accuracy metrics (Sensitivity and Specificity). Experimental results showed that web service (WS1) gained top selection score with the (47.0588%) trusted instances, and web service (WS2) was selected the least with (25.00%) trusted instances. Evaluation results of the proposed web services selection approach were found as (asymptotic sig. = 0.019), demonstrating the relationship between final selection and recommended trust score of web services."
Defect Diagnosis and Classification of Machine Parts Based on Deep Learning,2022,"['Machinery Parts', 'Defect of Welding', 'Circular Plug', 'Electro Galvanized Nuts', 'Deep Neural Network']",,"The automatic defect sorting function of machinery parts is being introduced to the automation of the manufacturing process. In the final stage of automation of the manufacturing process, it is necessary to apply computer vision rather than human visual judgment to determine whether there is a defect. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning method to improve the classification performance of typical mechanical parts, such as welding parts, galvanized round plugs, and electro galvanized nuts, based on the results of experiments. In the case of poor welding, the method to further increase the depth of layer of the basic deep learning model was effective, and in the case of a circular plug, the surrounding data outside the defective target area affected it, so it could be solved through an appropriate pre-processing technique. Finally, in the case of a nut plated with zinc, since it receives data from multiple cameras due to its three-dimensional structure, it is greatly affected by lighting and has a problem in that it also affects the background image. To solve this problem, methods such as two-dimensional connectivity were applied in the object segmentation preprocessing process. Although the experiments suggested that the proposed methods are effective, most of the provided good/defective images data sets are relatively small, which may cause a learning balance problem of the deep learning model, so we plan to secure more data in the future."
Comparison of Research Topics on Transportation Decarbonization Between Asian and Non-Asian Regions: Using Topic Modeling and Machine Learning Algorithms,2022,"['Decarbonization', 'Transportation', 'Asia', 'Topic Modeling', 'Machine Learning']",,"The growing global interest to decarbonize the transportation industry has resulted in numerous scientific publications. This study reviews the rapidly expanding body of research and identifies the knowledge gaps in transport decarbonization between regions. This study employs a hybrid approach combining topic modeling and machine learning to identify research topics and their knowledge structures, and then compares the main debated topics between Asia and non-Asian regions. A dataset of 777 articles, including 410 Asian and 367 non-Asian articles, published between 1990 and 2022 was extracted from the Scopus database. The latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling results showed that five potential topics were derived from Asia, while six were derived from non-Asian regions, and the knowledge structure of each topic differed between the two regions. The K-nearest neighbor machine learning algorithm results indicated a 92% accuracy for Asian topics and an 89% accuracy for non-Asian topics. The findings suggest that the Asian studies focused on “energy use in transportation” and “drivers of CO2 emissions in transportation,” while the non-Asian studies focused on “electric vehicles” and “fuel consumption.” This paper will keep academics and practitioners updated on the paradigm shift in the research on transportation decarbonization."
Centralized Machine Learning Versus Federated Averaging: A Comparison using MNIST Dataset,2022,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Conventional machine learning', 'Deep neural network', 'Federated learning', 'and Federated averaging']",,"A flood of information has occurred with the rise of the internet and digital devices in the fourth industrial revolution era. Every millisecond, massive amounts of structured and unstructured data are generated; smartphones, wearable devices, sensors, and self-driving cars are just a few examples of devices that currently generate massive amounts of data in our daily. Machine learning has been considered an approach to support and recognize patterns in data in many areas to provide a convenient way to other sectors, including the healthcare sector, government sector, banks, military sector, and more. However, the conventional machine learning model requires the data owner to upload their information to train the model in one central location to perform the model training. This classical model has caused data owners to worry about the risks of transferring private information because traditional machine learning is required to push their data to the cloud to process the model training.Furthermore, the training of machine learning and deep learning models requires massive computing resources. Thus, many researchers have jumped to a new model known as ""Federated Learning"". Federated learning is emerging to train Artificial Intelligence models over distributed clients, and it provides secure privacy information to the data owner. Hence, this paper implements Federated Averaging with a Deep Neural Network to classify the handwriting image and protect the sensitive data. Moreover, we compare the centralized machine learning model with federated averaging. The result shows the centralized machine learning model outperforms federated learning in terms of accuracy, but this classical model produces another risk, like privacy concern, due to the data being stored in the data center. The MNIST dataset was used in this experiment."

"Uniting cyber security and machine learning: Advantages, challenges and future research",2022,"['Cyber security', 'Machine learning', 'Internet of Things (ioT)', 'Privacy', 'Security', 'Intrusion detection']",,"Machine learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which focuses on the implementation of some systems that can learn from the historical data, identify patterns and make logical decisions with little to no human interventions. Cyber security is the practice of protecting digital systems, such as computers, servers, mobile devices, networks and associated data from malicious attacks. Uniting cyber security and ML has two major aspects, namely accounting for cyber security where the machine learning is applied, and the use of machine learning for enabling cyber security. This uniting can help us in various ways, like it provides enhanced security to the machine learning models, improves the performance of the cyber security methods, and supports effective detection of zero day attacks with less human intervention. In this survey paper, we discuss about two different concepts by uniting cyber security and ML. We also discuss the advantages, issues and challenges of uniting cyber security and ML. Furthermore, we discuss the various attacks and provide a comprehensive comparative study of various techniques in two different considered categories. Finally, we provide some future research directions."
Machine Learning-Based Predictor for Treatment Outcomes of Patients With Salivary Gland Cancer After Operation,2022,"['Deep learning', 'Machine learning', 'Prognosis', 'Salivary gland cancer.']",,"Background and Objectives The purpose of this study was to analyze the survival data of salivary gland cancer (SGCs) patients to construct machine learning and deep learning mod- els that can predict survival and use them to stratify SGC patients according to risk estimate. Subjects and Method We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathologic data from 460 pa- tients with SGCs from 2006 to 2018.Results In Cox proportional hazard (CPH) model, pM, stage, lymphovascular invasion, lymph node ratio, and age exhibited significant correlation with patient’s survival.

Machine learning-based risk factor analysis for periodontal disease from a Korean National Survey,2022,"['periodontal disease', 'risk factors', 'feature extraction', 'machine learning', 'prediction model']",,"Periodontal disease is a chronic but treatable condition which often does not cause pain during the initial stages of the illness. Lack of awareness of symptoms can delay initiation of treatment and worsen health. The aim of this study was to develop and compare different risk prediction models for periodontal disease using machine learning algorithms. We obtained information on risk factors for periodontal disease from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) dataset. Principal component analysis and an auto-encoder were used to extract data on risk factors for periodontal disease. A synthetic minority oversampling technique algorithm was used to solve the problem of data imbalance. We used a combination of logistic regression analysis, support vector machine (SVM) learning, random forest, and AdaBoost to classify and compare risk prediction models for periodontal disease.In cases where we used principal component analysis (PCA) to extract risk factors, the recall was higher than the feature selection method in the logistic regression and support-vector machine learning models. AdaBoost’s recall was 0.98, showing the highest performance of both feature selection and PCA. The F1 score showed relatively high performance in AdaBoost, logistic regression, and SVM learning models. By using the risk factors extracted from the research results and the predictive model based on machine learning, it will be able to help in the prevention and diagnosis of periodontal disease, and it will be used to study the relationship with various diseases related to periodontal disease."
IRSML: An intelligent routing algorithm based on machine learning in software defined wireless networking,2022,"['intelligent routing', 'reinforcement learning', 'SDWN', 'supervised learning']",,"In software-defined wireless networking (SDWN), the optimal routing technique is one of the effective solutions to improve its performance. This routing technique is done by many different methods, with the most common using integer linear programming problem (ILP), building optimal routing metrics. These methods often only focus on one routing objective, such as minimizing the packet blocking probability, minimizing end-to-end delay (EED), and maximizing network throughput. It is difficult to consider multiple objectives concurrently in a routing algorithm. In this paper, we investigate the application of machine learning to control routing in the SDWN. An intelligent routing algorithm is then proposed based on the machine learning to improve the network performance. The proposed algorithm can optimize multiple routing objectives. Our idea is to combine supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL) methods to discover new routes. The SL is used to predict the performance metrics of the links, including EED quality of transmission (QoT), and packet blocking probability (PBP). The routing is done by the RL method. We use the Q-value in the fundamental equation of the RL to store the PBP, which is used for the aim of route selection. Concurrently, the learning rate coefficient is flexibly changed to determine the constraints of routing during learning. These constraints include QoT and EED. Our performance evaluations based on OMNeT++ have shown that the proposed algorithm has significantly improved the network performance in terms of the QoT, EED, packet delivery ratio, and network throughput compared with other wellknown routing algorithms."
Predicting Hydrological Drought Alert Levels Using Supervised Machine-Learning Classifiers,2022,"['Machine-learning classifier', 'Drought alert level', 'Hydrological drought prediction', 'Supervised learning']",,"Reliable drought prediction is a global challenge in disaster-prone regions around the world. Data-driven models such as machine-learning (ML) classifiers have recently received considerable attention from water resources planners and managers. In this study, we applied several ML classifiers, including decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) to the prediction of hydrological drought classes. Daily data of precipitation, reservoir inflow, and reservoir volume collected from three large dams (Andong, Chungju, and Seomjin) in South Korea were used as classifier input to predict hydrological drought alert levels. A comparison of the accuracy and computation time of each ML classifier revealed that the classifiers were capable of predicting hydrological drought alert levels, with the SVM achieving outstanding performance in terms of accuracy (97%) and precision (89%) and the NB exhibiting superior computational time (0.63 sec). The results of this study indicated that the ML classifiers can be effective predictors of hydrological drought classes and can provide warnings of drought conditions."
Machine Learning-based UWB Error Correction Experiment in an Indoor Environment,2022,"['Ultra-wideband (UWB)', 'machine learning']",,"In this paper, we propose a method for estimating the error of the Ultra-Wideband (UWB) distance measurement using the channel impulse response (CIR) of the UWB signal based on machine learning. Due to the recent demand for indoor locationbased services, wireless signal-based localization technologies are being studied, such as UWB, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. The constructive obstacles constituting the indoor environment make the distance measurement of UWB inaccurate, which lowers the indoor localization accuracy. Therefore, we apply machine learning to learn the characteristics of UWB signals and estimate the error of UWB distance measurements. In addition, the performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed through experiments in an indoor environment composed of various walls."
Machine learning for the prediction of preclinical airway management in injured patients: a registry-based trial,2022,"['Intratracheal intubation', 'Machine learning', 'Bayes theorem', 'Wounds and injuries', 'Decision trees']",,"Objective The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of using machine learning to establish the need for preclinical airway management for injured patients based on a standardized emergency dataset.Methods A registry-based, retrospective analysis was conducted of adult trauma patients who were treated by physician-staffed emergency medical services in southwestern Germany between 2018 and 2020. The primary outcome was to assess the feasibility of using the random forest (RF) and Naive Bayes (NB) machine learning algorithms to predict the need for preclinical airway management. The secondary outcome was to use a principal component analysis to determine the attributes that can be used and advanced for future model development.Results In total, 25,556 adults with multiple injuries were identified, including 1,451 patients (5.7%) who required airway management. Key attributes were auscultation, injury pattern, oxygen therapy, thoracic drainage, noninvasive ventilation, catecholamines, pelvic sling, colloid infusion, initial vital signs, preemergency status, and shock index. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was between 0.96 (RF; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96–0.97) and 0.93 (NB; 95% CI, 0.92–0.93; P<0.01). For the prediction of airway management, RF yielded a higher precision-recall area than NB (0.83 [95% CI, 0.8–0.85] vs. 0.66 [95% CI, 0.61–0.72], respectively; P<0.01).Conclusion To predict the need for preclinical airway management in injured patients, attributes that are commonly recorded in standardized datasets can be used with machine learning. In future models, the RF algorithm could be used because it has robust prediction accuracy."
A machine learning model for predicting favorable outcome in severe traumatic brain injury patients after 6 months,2022,"['artificial intelligence', 'favorable outcome', 'neuromonitoring', 'neurotrauma', 'traumatic brain injury.']",,"Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI), which occurs commonly worldwide, is among the more costly of health and socioeconomic problems. Accurate prediction of favorable outcomes in severe TBI patients could assist with optimizing treatment procedures, predicting clinical outcomes, and result in substantial economic savings.Methods: In this study, we examined the capability of a machine learning-based model in predicting “favorable” or “unfavorable” outcomes after 6 months in severe TBI patients using only parameters measured on admission. Three models were developed using logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines trained on parameters recorded from 2,381 severe TBI patients admitted to the neuro-intensive care unit of Rajaee (Emtiaz) Hospital (Shiraz, Iran) between 2015 and 2017. Model performance was evaluated using three indices: sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. A ten-fold cross-validation method was used to estimate these indices.Results: Overall, the developed models showed excellent performance with AUC around 0.81, sensitivity and specificity of around 0.78. The top-three factors important in predicting 6-month post-trauma survival status in TBI patients are “Glasgow coma scale motor response,” “pupillary reactivity,” and “age.”Conclusions: Machine learning techniques might be used to predict the 6-month outcome in TBI patients using only the parameters measured on admission when the machine learning is trained using a large data set."
Fundamentals and machine learning in forecast of won-dollar exchange rate,2022,"['exchange rate forecast', 'machine learning', 'long short-term memory', 'empirical mode decomposition']",,"There are two issues in exchange rate forecast. One is the low explanatory power of economic fundamentals for high frequency exchange rate. The other is the usefulness of machine learning for exchange rate prediction. This paper tries to reconcile those issues by trying to use fundamentals to predict daily exchange rate with machine learning. To match monthly frequency fundamentals with daily exchange rate, linear interpolation is used to transform monthly data to daily. To reduce the noise, daily exchange rates are decomposed to trend and cyclical components using empirical model decomposition (EMD). Regression of trend part of exchange rate on fundamental variables show that the macroeconomic fundamentals have some explanatory power for daily exchange rate. For the forecast, long short-term memory (LSTM) of recurrent neural network (RNN) is applied to trend and cycle part separately. Based on the regression result, fundamental variables are used as input features of LSTM of trend component. Lagged variables are used for LSTM of cyclical part.Forecasts from the two LSTM models are added to get predictors of exchange rate. Results show that trend-cycle LSTM forecasts are better than the traditional random walk predictors."
Application of machine learning methods for predicting the mechanical properties of rubbercrete,2022,"['linear gene expression programming', 'M5P model tree', 'machine learning', 'mechanical properties', 'rubbercrete']",,"The use of waste rubber in concrete can reduce natural aggregate consumption and improve some technical properties of concrete. Although there are several equations for estimating the mechanical properties of concrete containing waste rubber, limited numbers of machine learning-based models have been proposed to predict the mechanical properties of rubbercrete. In this study, an extensive database of the mechanical properties of rubbercrete was gathered from a comprehensive survey of the literature. To model the mechanical properties of rubbercrete, M5P tree and linear gene expression programming (LGEP) methods as two machine learning techniques were employed to achieve reliable mathematical equations. Two procedures of input variable selection were considered in this study. The crucial component ratios of rubbercrete and concrete age were assumed as the input variables in the first procedure. In contrast, the volumes of the coarse and fine waste rubber and the compressive strength of concrete without waste rubber were considered the second procedure of the input variables. The results show that the models obtained by LGEP are more accurate than those achieved by the M5P model tree and existing traditional equations. Besides, the volumes of the coarse and fine waste rubber and the compressive strength of concrete without waste rubber are better predictors of the mechanical properties of rubbercrete compared to the first procedure of input variable selection."
Performance Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms for Received Signal Strength-Based Indoor LOS/NLOS Classification of LTE Signals,2022,"['indoor navigation', 'machine learning', 'received signal strength', 'line-of-sight', 'non-line-of-sight']",,"An indoor navigation system that utilizes long-term evolution (LTE) signals has the benefit of no additional infrastructure installation expenses and low base station database management costs. Among the LTE signal measurements, received signal strength (RSS) is particularly appealing because it can be easily obtained with mobile devices. Propagation channel models can be used to estimate the position of mobile devices with RSS. However, conventional channel models have a shortcoming in that they do not discriminate between line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions of the received signal. Accordingly, a previous study has suggested separated LOS and NLOS channel models. However, a method for determining LOS and NLOS conditions was not devised. In this study, a machine learning-based LOS/NLOS classification method using RSS measurements is developed. We suggest several machine-learning features and evaluate various machinelearning algorithms. As an indoor experimental result, up to 87.5% classification accuracy was achieved with an ensemble algorithm. Furthermore, the range estimation accuracy with an average error of 13.54 m was demonstrated, which is a 25.3% improvement over the conventional channel model."

Machine learning-based design automation of CMOS analog circuits using SCA-mGWO algorithm,2022,"['algorithm', 'analog circuits', 'design automation', 'machine learning', 'optimization']",,"Analog circuit design is comparatively more complex than its digital counterpart due to its nonlinearity and low level of abstraction. This study proposes a novel low-level hybrid of the sine-cosine algorithm (SCA) and modified greywolf optimization (mGWO) algorithm for machine learning-based design automation of CMOS analog circuits using an all-CMOS voltage reference circuit in 40-nm standard process. The optimization algorithm’s efficiency is further tested using classical functions, showing that it outperforms other competing algorithms.

Monte Carlo analysis is also performed on the presented analog circuit for output voltage and percentage variation resulting in significantly low mean and standard deviation."
Building and analyzing machine learning-based warfarin dose prediction models using scikit-learn,2022,"['Machine Learning', 'Personalized Medicine', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Clinical Decision Rules', 'Warfarin']",,"For personalized drug dosing, prediction models may be utilized to overcome the inter-individual variability. Multiple linear regression has been used as a conventional method to model the relationship between patient features and optimal drug dose. However, linear regression cannot capture non-linear relationships and may be adversely affected by non-normal distribution and collinearity of data. To overcome this hurdle, machine learning models have been extensively adapted in drug dose prediction. In this tutorial, random forest and neural network models will be trained in tandem with a multiple linear regression model on the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium dataset using the scikit-learn python library. Subsequent model analyses including performance comparison, permutation feature importance computation and partial dependence plotting will be demonstrated. The basic methods of model training and analysis discussed in this article may be implemented in drug dose-related studies."
Machine learning‑based parameter identification method for wireless power transfer systems,2022,"['Wireless power transfer', 'Support vector regression', 'Parameter identification', 'Coupling coefficient', 'Load resistance']",,"Parameter identification is an effective way to obtain uncertain parameters of wireless power transfer (WPT) systems, which is essential to achieving robust control and efficiency improvement. The traditional method relies on the phase lock of the primary impedance angle or lengthy algorithm iterations, and the identification depends on a high sampling accuracy and is time-consuming. In this study, a flexible parameter identification method based on the fusion of a machine learning model and a circuit model is proposed. Taking the primary voltage and current as input characteristic factors, support vector regression (SVR) is used to establish a machine learning model for coupling coefficient identification. In addition, the optimal model parameters are sought based on the grid search method. On the basis of coupling coefficient identification, the circuit model is used to realize the identification of the load resistance. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed parameter identification method for a WPT system is verified by experimental results."
"Machine-learning algorithms for asthma, COPD, and lung cancer risk assessment using circulating microbial extracellular vesicle data and their application to assess dietary effects",2022,,,"Although mounting evidence suggests that the microbiome has a tremendous influence on intractable disease, the relationship between circulating microbial extracellular vesicles (EVs) and respiratory disease remains unexplored. Here, we developed predictive diagnostic models for COPD, asthma, and lung cancer by applying machine learning to microbial EV metagenomes isolated from patient serum and coded by their accumulated taxonomic hierarchy. All models demonstrated high predictive strength with mean AUC values ranging from 0.93 to 0.99 with various important features at the genus and phylum levels. Application of the clinical models in mice showed that various foods reduced high-fat diet-associated asthma and lung cancer risk, while COPD was minimally affected. In conclusion, this study offers a novel methodology for respiratory disease prediction and highlights the utility of serum microbial EVs as data-rich features for noninvasive diagnosis."
Machine learning-based categorization of source terms for risk assessment of nuclear power plants,2022,"['Level 2 probabilistic safety assessment', 'Source term category', 'Accident consequence', 'Autoencoder', 'Clustering']",,"In general, a number of severe accident scenarios derived from Level 2 probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) are typically grouped into several categories to efficiently evaluate their potential impacts on the public with the assumption that scenarios within the same group have similar source term characteristics. To date, however, grouping by similar source terms has been completely reliant on qualitative methods such as logical trees or expert judgements. Recently, an exhaustive simulation approach has been developed to provide quantitative information on the source terms of a large number of severe accident scenarios. With this motivation, this paper proposes a machine learning-based categorization method based on exhaustive simulation for grouping scenarios with similar accident consequences. The proposed method employs clustering with an autoencoder for grouping unlabeled scenarios after dimensionality reductions and feature extractions from the source term data. To validate the suggested method, source term data for 658 severe accident scenarios were used. Results confirmed that the proposed method successfully characterized the severe accident scenarios with similar behavior more precisely than the conventional grouping method"
Machine learning-based adaptive CSI feedback interval,2022,"['Channel state information feedback', 'Feedback interval', 'Adaptive feedback', 'Machine learning-based feedback']",,"The channel state information (CSI) is essential for the base station (BS) to schedule user equipments (UEs) and efficiently manage the radio resources. Hence, the BS requests UEs to regularly feed back the CSI. However, frequent CSI reporting causes large signaling overhead. To reduce the feedback overhead, we propose two machine learning-based approaches to adjust the CSI feedback interval. We use a deep neural network and reinforcement learning (RL) to decide whether an UE feeds back the CSI. Simulation results show that the RL-based approach achieves the lowest mean squared error while reducing the number of CSI feedback transmissions."

Machine-Learning for Prescription Patterns: Random Forest in the Prediction of Dose and Number of Antipsychotics Prescribed to People with Schizophrenia,2022,"['Schizophrenia', 'Antipsychotic drugs', 'Drug prescription', 'Drug polytherapy', 'Machine learning.']",,"Objective: We aimed to predict antipsychotic prescription patterns for people with schizophrenia using machine learning (ML) algorithms.Methods: In a cross-sectional design, a sample of community mental health service users (SUs; n = 368) with a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia was randomly selected. Socio-demographic and clinical features, including the number, total dose, and route of administration of the antipsychotic treatment were recorded. Information about the number and the length of psychiatric hospitalization was retrieved. Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression and ML algorithms (i.e., random forest [RF], supported vector machine, K-nearest neighborhood, and Naïve Bayes) were used to estimate the predictors of total antipsychotic dosage and prescription of antipsychotic polytherapy (APP).Results: The strongest predictor of the total dose was APP. The number of Community Mental Health Centers (CMHC) contacts was the most important predictor of APP and, with APP omitted, of dosage. Treatment with anticholinergics predicted APP, emphasizing the strong correlation between APP and higher antipsychotic dose. RF performed better than OLS regression and the other ML algorithms in predicting both antipsychotic dose (root square mean error = 0.70, R2 = 0.31) and APP (area under the receiving operator curve = 0.66, true positive rate = 0.41, and true negative rate = 0.78).Conclusion: APP is associated with the prescription of higher total doses of antipsychotics. Frequent attenders at CMHCs, and SUs recently hospitalized are often treated with APP and higher doses of antipsychotics. Future prospective studies incorporating standardized clinical assessments for both psychopathological severity and treatment efficacy are needed to confirm these findings."
MACHINE LEARNING APPLICATION TO PREDICT COMBUSTION PHASE OF A DIRECT INJECTION SPARK IGNITION ENGINE,2022,"['MFB50', 'Artificial neural network', 'Control function', 'DISI engine', 'Lean burn', 'CCV']",,"Lean-diluted combustion can enhance thermal efficiency and reduce exhaust gas emissions from spark-ignited (SI) gasoline engines. However, excessive lean mixture with external dilution leads to combustion instability due to high cycle-to-cycle variations (CCV). The CCV should be controlled as low as possible to achieve stable combustion, high engine performance, and low emissions. Therefore, a stable combustion control function is required to predict the combustion phase with a low calculation load. A machine learning-based function is developed in this work to predict the 50 % mass fraction burn location (MFB50). Input parameters to the machine learning model consist of 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-cycle from a three-cylinder production-based gasoline engine operated under stoichiometric to the lean-burn mixture. The results show that the MFB50 prediction model achieves high accuracy when 2-cycle data are used relative to 1-cycle data, which implies that the previous cycle data affects the predicted MFB50 of the next cycle. As a result, the neural network model can predict the cyclic MFB50 error within ± 3 oCA CCV and ± 5 oCA CCV with 70 % and 90 % accuracy, respectively. However, an increasing number of cycle data worsens the prediction accuracy due to model over-learning."

SDN brings more control, higher scalability, and serene elasticity. The SDN spontaneously changes the network configuration according to the dynamic network requirements inside the constrained environments. Therefore, a monitoring system that can monitor the physical and virtual entities is needed to operate this type of network technology with high efficiency and proficiency. In this manuscript, we propose a real-time monitoring system for data collection and visualization that includes the Prometheus, node exporter, and Grafana. A node exporter is configured on the physical devices to collect the physical and virtual entities resources utilization logs. A real-time Prometheus database is configured to collect and store the data from all the exporters. Furthermore, the Grafana is affixed with Prometheus to visualize the current network status and device provisioning. A monitoring system is deployed on the physical infrastructure of the KOREN topology. Data collected by the monitoring system is further pre-processed and restructured into a dataset. A monitoring system is further enhanced by including machine learning techniques applied on the formatted datasets to identify the elephant flows. Additionally, a Random Forest is trained on our generated labeled datasets, and the classification models’ performance are verified using accuracy metrics."
An Efficient Machine Learning-based Text Summarization in the Malayalam Language,2022,"['Malayalam Text Summarization', 'Supervised Machine Learning', 'SVM', 'Text Mining', 'Sentence Extraction', 'Summary Generation']",,"Automatic text summarization is a procedure that packs enormous content into a more limited book that incorporates significant data. Malayalam is one of the toughest languages utilized in certain areas of India, most normally in Kerala and in Lakshadweep. Natural language processing in the Malayalam language is relatively low due to the complexity of the language as well as the scarcity of available resources. In this paper, a way is proposed to deal with the text summarization process in Malayalam documents by training a model based on the Support Vector Machine classification algorithm. Different features of the text are taken into account for training the machine so that the system can output the most important data from the input text. The classifier can classify the most important, important, average, and least significant sentences into separate classes and based on this, the machine will be able to create a summary of the input document. The user can select a compression ratio so that the system will output that much fraction of the summary. The model performance is measured by using different genres of Malayalam documents as well as documents from the same domain. The model is evaluated by considering content evaluation measures precision, recall, F score, and relative utility. Obtained precision and recall value shows that the model is trustable and found to be more relevant compared to the other summarizers."

The Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36) and lower back pain scores were assess as pre- and post-workout measurements. Scores for the treatment-satisfaction subscale of the visual analog scale (TS-VAS), intention to use a disease-oriented exercise program, intention to recommend the program to others, and available expenses for a disease-oriented exercise program were determined after the workout.Results: The MDMECA group showed a higher increase in SF-36 score (MDMECA, 9.10; control, 1.09; p<0.01) and a greater reduction in lower back pain score (MDMECA, -0.96; control, -0.26; p<0.01). Scores for TS-VAS, intention to use a disease-oriented exercise program, and intention to recommend the program to others were all higher (p<0.01) in the MDMECA group. However, the available expenses for a disease-oriented program were not significantly different between the two groups.Conclusion: The MDMECA is more effective than video streaming-based exercise in increasing exercise adherence, improving QoL, and reducing lower back pain. MDMECAs could be promising tools of use to achieve better medical outcomes and higher treatment satisfaction."
An Analysis of Machine-Learning Feature-Extraction Techniques using Syntactic Tagging for Cross-site Scripting Detection,2022,"['Cross-site Scripting', 'Supervised Machine Learning', 'Syntactic N-gram Features', 'Text Classification', 'Web Security']",,Working for a strategy to ensure web application security has become more complex as it is not only to protect against the more challenging cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks but also to assist the open expressiveness of web applications to provide users with interactive services. The feature extractions used in supervised machine learning to detect XSS as an approach to the strategy are now in question of their effective classification. Their lack of preserving structural information may not uphold the property of structured data in input payloads. We apply the concept of syntactic n-grams to a payload text representation. The study of different feature extractions on the representation is to see if syntactic information is maintained. Our purpose is to determine the more effective approach to correctly classify benign and malicious payloads on a real-world dataset. The use of sn-grams that produces the most favourable results of accuracy and precision would only indicate that the extraction is reasonably able to minimize false reports during classification.

Secure Wireless Communication via Adversarial Machine Learning: A Priori vs. A Posteriori,2022,"['Wireless communication', 'Adversarial example', 'Machine learning', 'Modulation recognition']",,"This paper considers wireless communication system consisted of one transmitter, one legitimate receiver, and one eavesdropper. The transmitter transmits perturbation-added signal (i.e. adversarial example) with a certain modulation type, while the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper adopt deep neural networks (DNN)-based classifier to recognize the modulation type of the received signal. Compared to the fact that the general goal of adversarial examples being a misclassification of all available classifiers, our objective is to design an adversarial example that lets the legitimate receiver classify accurately while the eavesdropper misclassifies. To this end, we propose two design approaches of the adversarial examples: A priori; A posteriori, i.e. before and after learning steps of the receiver, respectively. Numerical results show that both approaches are effective for securing the communication link."
Fish Freshness Identification Using Machine Learning: Performance Comparison of k-NN and Naïve Bayes Classifier,2022,"['Fish freshness identification', 'Machine learning', 'Fisheye images', 'Computer science', 'k-NN', 'Naive Bayes']",,"Fish is one of the food sources that should be examined for freshness before being consumed. The consumption of rotten fish can cause various diseases. The rotten fish have changed color on the gills, skin, flesh, and eyes and have a pungent odour. Fish freshness can be assessed using a variety of conventional methods, but these methods have limitations, such as requiring relatively expensive equipment and trained personnel and being destructive. We use machine learning because it is non-destructive, reduces costs, and is easy to use. This study aims to identify the freshness of fish using k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and Naïve Bayes (NB) classification methods based on the fish-eye image. The features used in the classification process are RGB and GLCM. The research stages consist of the fish collection process, image acquisition and class division, preprocessing and ROI detection, feature extraction and dataset split, and the classification process. The results show that the k-NN method has better performance than NB with average accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and AUC of 0.97, 0.97, 0.97, 0.97, and 0.97, respectively."

"A Hybrid Physical and Machine Learning Model for Assessing Landslide Spatial Probability caused by raising of ground water table and Earthquake in Atsuma, Japan - Case Study",2022,"['Earthquake', 'Landslide susceptibility', 'Multilayer perceptron neural networks', 'Pseudo-static', 'Rainfall']",,"Landslides are catastrophic natural events primed and/or triggered by extreme rainfalls and strong earthquakes. Simultaneous occurrence of rainfall and seismic activity increases the likelihood of landslides. However, the researchers focused on this aspect are not much. In the present research, a hybrid model was developed to predict the landslide occurrences probability in Atsuma, Japan triggered by rainfalls and earthquakes. The proposed model is a combination of a physical and machine learning model for improving the accuracy of the landslide susceptibility mapping. The proposed model consisted of a physical module, a machine learning module and a matrix approach module. The physical module assessed the effects of rainfall and peak ground acceleration (PGA) on landslide occurrence probability based on a pseudo-static model. The machine learning module applied Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks to assess landslide susceptibility, using 611 landslide events caused by strong earthquakes and extreme typhoons. The landslide susceptibility maps obtained from these two modules were then combined into final susceptibility map through a matrix approach. The final susceptibility map included five susceptible levels: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. To evaluate the proposed model performance, the resulting models were assessed using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves. The areas under the success rate curves from the physical module, machine learning module and matrix-based approach showed 79.2%, 82.7% and 83.9% accuracy, respectively. Furthermore, the predicted rate curves showed that the areas under the curve for physical module, machine learning module and matrix-based approach were 78.4%, 82.3% and 83.4%, respectively. These results suggest that the proposed hybrid model improves the prediction capability compared to physically-based method or machine learning model and can be readily used to assess spatial probability of landslide."

Therefore, we trained machine learning models that predict the brain age gap of healthy subjects in the East Asian population using T1 brain MRI volume images.Methods: In total, 154 T1-weighted MRIs of healthy subjects (55–83 years of age) were collected from an East Asian community. The information of age, gender, and education level was collected for each participant. The MRIs of the participants were preprocessed using FreeSurfer(https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) to collect the brain volume data. We trained the models using different supervised machine learning regression algorithms from the scikit-learn (https://scikit-learn.org/) library.Results: The trained models comprised 19 features that had been reduced from 55 brain volume labels. The algorithm BayesianRidge (BR) achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) and r squared (R2) of 3 and 0.3 years, respectively, in predicting the age of the new subjects compared to other regression methods. The results of feature importance analysis showed that the right pallidum, white matter hypointensities on T1-MRI scans, and left hippocampus comprise some of the essential features in predicting brain age.Conclusions: The MAE and R2 accuracies of the BR model predicting brain age gap in the East Asian population showed that the model could reduce the dimensionality of neuroimaging data to provide a meaningful biomarker for individual brain aging."
Machine Learning Model for the Prediction of Hemorrhage in Intensive Care Units,2022,"['Hemorrhage', 'Prognosis', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Blood Transfusion']",,"Objectives: Early hemorrhage detection in intensive care units (ICUs) enables timely intervention and reduces the risk of irreversible outcomes. In this study, we aimed to develop a machine learning model to predict hemorrhage by learning the patterns of continuously changing, real-world clinical data. Methods: We used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care databases (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV). A recurrent neural network was used to predict severe hemorrhage in the ICU. We developed three machine learning models with an increasing number of input features and levels of complexity: model 1 (11 features), model 2 (18 features), and model 3 (27 features). MIMIC-III was used for model training, and MIMIC-IV was split for internal validation. Using the model with the highest performance, external verification was performed using data from a subgroup extracted from the eICU Collaborative Research Database. Results: We included 5,670 ICU admissions, with 3,150 in the training set and 2,520 in the internal test set. A positive correlation was found between model complexity and performance. As a measure of performance, three models developed with an increasing number of features showed area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve values of 0.61–0.94 according to the range of input data. In the subgroup extracted from the eICU database for external validation, an AUROC value of 0.74 was observed. Conclusions: Machine learning models that rely on real clinical data can be used to predict patients at high risk of bleeding in the ICU."

However, theinterpretation of FHR is a complex and subjective process with low reliability. This study developed a machine learning modelthat can classify fetal cardiotocography results as normal or abnormal.Materials and Methods: In total, 17492 fetal cardiotocography results were obtained from Ajou University Hospital and 100 fetalcardiotocography results from Czech Technical University and University Hospital in Brno. Board-certified physicians then re viewed the fetal cardiotocography results and labeled 1456 of them as gold-standard; these results were used to train and validatethe model. The remaining results were used to validate the clinical effectiveness of the model with the actual outcome.Results: In a test dataset, our model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.89 and areaunder the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.73 in an internal validation dataset. An average AUROC of 0.73 and average AUPRCof 0.40 were achieved in the external validation dataset. Fetus abnormality score, as calculated from the continuous fetal cardioto cography results, was significantly associated with actual clinical outcomes [intrauterine growth restriction: odds ratio, 3.626(p=0.031); Apgar score 1 min: odds ratio, 9.523 (p<0.001), Apgar score 5 min: odds ratio, 11.49 (p=0.001), and fetal distress: odds ra tio, 23.09 (p<0.001)].Conclusion: The machine learning model developed in this study showed precision in classifying FHR signals. This suggests thatthe model can be applied to medical devices as a screening tool for monitoring fetal status."
Machine Learning Model for Predicting Postoperative Survival of Patients with Colorectal Cancer,2022,"['Machine learning', 'LightGBM', 'Colorectal neoplasms', 'Area under the curve', 'Mortality', 'SEER']",,"Purpose Machine learning (ML) is a strong candidate for making accurate predictions, as we can use large amount of data with powerful computational algorithms. We developed a ML based model to predict survival of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) using data from two independent datasets.Materials and Methods A total of 364,316 and 1,572 CRC patients were included from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and a Korean dataset, respectively. As SEER combines data from 18 cancer registries, internal validation was done using 18-Fold-Cross-Validation then external validation was performed by testing the trained model on the Korean dataset. Performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity and positive predictive values.Results Clinicopathological characteristics were significantly different between the two datasets and the SEER showed a significant lower 5-year survival rate compared to the Korean dataset (60.1% vs. 75.3%, p < 0.001). The ML-based model using the Light gradient boosting algorithm achieved a better performance in predicting 5-year-survival compared to American Joint Committee on Cancer stage (AUROC, 0.804 vs. 0.736; p < 0.001). The most important features which influenced model performance were age, number of examined lymph nodes, and tumor size. Sensitivity and positive predictive values of predicting 5-year-survival for classes including dead or alive were reported as 68.14%, 77.51% and 49.88%, 88.1% respectively in the validation set. Survival probability can be checked using the web-based survival predictor (http://colorectalcancer.pythonanywhere.com).Conclusion ML-based model achieved a much better performance compared to staging in individualized estimation of survival of patients with CRC."

Machine Learning Models for Predicting the Occurrence of Respiratory Diseases Using Climatic and Air-Pollution Factors,2022,"['Machine Learning', 'Respiratory Diseases', 'Climate', 'Air Pollution', 'Gradient Boosting', 'Gaussian Process Regression']",,"Objectives. Because climatic and air-pollution factors are known to influence the occurrence of respiratory diseases, we used these factors to develop machine learning models for predicting the occurrence of respiratory diseases. Methods. We obtained the daily number of respiratory disease patients in Seoul. We used climatic and air-pollution factors to predict the daily number of patients treated for respiratory diseases per 10,000 inhabitants. We applied the reliefbased feature selection algorithm to evaluate the importance of feature selection. We used the gradient boosting and Gaussian process regression (GPR) methods, respectively, to develop two different prediction models. We also employed the holdout cross-validation method, in which 75% of the data was used to train the model, and the remaining 25% was used to test the trained model. We determined the estimated number of respiratory disease patients by applying the developed prediction models to the test set. To evaluate the performance of each model, we calculated the coefficient of determination (R2 ) and the root mean square error (RMSE) between the original and estimated numbers of respiratory disease patients. We used the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach to interpret the estimated output of each machine learning model. Results. Features with negative weights in the relief-based algorithm were excluded. When applying gradient boosting to unseen test data, R2 and RMSE were 0.68 and 13.8, respectively. For GPR, the R2 and RMSE were 0.67 and 13.9, respectively. SHAP analysis showed that reductions in average temperature, daylight duration, average humidity, sulfur dioxide (SO2), total solar insolation amount, and temperature difference increased the number of respiratory disease patients, whereas increases in atmospheric pressure, carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter ≤2.5 µm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) increased the number of respiratory disease patients. Conclusion. We successfully developed models for predicting the occurrence of respiratory diseases using climatic and airpollution factors. These models could evolve into public warning systems."

Presenting a Hybrid Scheme of Machine Learning Combined with Metaheuristic Optimizers for Predicting Final Cost and Time of Project,2022,"['Hybrid machine learning', 'Kalman filter', 'EVM', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Project cost', 'Project time']",,"A primary task to a project manager is to ensure that the project proceeds timely and on the budget. Earned value management (EVM) is the most common method to evaluate and further predict a project in terms of time and cost. Because of poor accuracy in forecasting different durations, the application of the EVM for schedule performance prediction has been limited. Therefore, in this paper, the Kalman filter was used to analyze the data and compare the results with those of a few hybrid machine learning (HML) techniques. The innovation of this study comes in the face of the prediction of the project time and cost by efficient machine learning algorithms based on some directly measurable variables. For this purpose, 398 data points from five different dam projects were used to predict two output variables by hybrid schemes of multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithm combined with the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), herein referred to as MLP-GA and MLP-PSO, respectively. Four input variables, namely earned schedule (month), earned value ($), actual progress (%), and actual cost (%), were considered for time prediction, and the time (month) was considered as an input variable for cost prediction. The results showed that early warnings for the risk of delay in project schedule and cost were generated in months 1 and 8 by the MLP-PSO, months 1 and 11 by the MLP-GA, and rather months 7 and NV (no value) for the Kalman filter, indicating the fast operation coupled with high accuracy of the HML algorithms, as compared to the Kalman filter. In addition, the two HML algorithms were compared based on statistical error indices to determine the best one. After reviewing the results, the MLP-PSO was found to outperform the MLP-GA in terms of convergence rate and accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, none of the previous studies have used the proposed hybrid algorithms (MELM-PSO and MELM-GA) for forecasting, simultaneously, the time and cost as two critical parameters in the project management, indicating the novelty of our research."
Using machine learning for anomaly detection on a system-on-chip under gamma radiation,2022,"['Gamma radiation', 'Machine learning', 'Anomaly detection', 'Field programmable gate arrays. TID']",,"The emergence of new nanoscale technologies has imposed significant challenges to designing reliable electronic systems in radiation environments. A few types of radiation like Total Ionizing Dose (TID) can cause permanent damages on such nanoscale electronic devices, and current state-of-the-art technologies to tackle TID make use of expensive radiation-hardened devices. This paper focuses on a novel and different approach: using machine learning algorithms on consumer electronic level Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to tackle TID effects and monitor them to replace before they stop working. This condition has a research challenge to anticipate when the board results in a total failure due to TID effects. We observed internal measurements of FPGA boards under gamma radiation and used three different anomaly detection machine learning (ML) algorithms to detect anomalies in the sensor measurements in a gamma-radiated environment. The statistical results show a highly significant relationship between the gamma radiation exposure levels and the board measurements. Moreover, our anomaly detection results have shown that a One-Class SVM with Radial Basis Function Kernel has an average recall score of 0.95. Also, all anomalies can be detected before the boards are entirely inoperative, i.e.voltages drop to zero and confirmed with a sanity check."
Development and validation of interpretable machine learning models for inpatient fall events and electronic medical record integration,2022,"['Accidental falls', 'Machine learning', 'Patient safety', 'Nursing informatics']",,"Objective Falls are one of the most frequently occurring adverse events among hospitalized patients. The Morse Fall Scale, which has been widely used for fall risk assessment, has the two limitations of low specificity and difficulty in practical implementation. The aim of this study was to develop and validate an interpretable machine learning model for prediction of falls to be integrated in an electronic medical record (EMR) system.Methods This was a retrospective study involving a tertiary teaching hospital in Seoul, Korea. Based on the literature, 83 known predictors were grouped into seven categories. Interpretable fall event prediction models were developed using multiple machine learning models including gradient boosting and Shapley values.Results Overall, 191,778 cases with 272 fall events (0.1%) were included in the analysis. With the validation cohort of 2020, the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of the gradient boosting model was 0.817 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.720–0.904), better performance than random forest (AUROC, 0.801; 95% CI, 0.708–0.890), logistic regression (AUROC, 0.802; 95% CI, 0.721–0.878), artificial neural net (AUROC, 0.736; 95% CI, 0.650–0.821), and conventional Morse fall score (AUROC, 0.652; 95% CI, 0.570–0.715). The model’s interpretability was enhanced at both the population and patient levels. The algorithm was later integrated into the current EMR system.Conclusion We developed an interpretable machine learning prediction model for inpatient fall events using EMR integration formats."
Applying advanced machine learning techniques in the early prediction of graduate ability of university students,2022,"['Graduate result', 'Machine learning', 'Graduation prediction', 'Random Forest', 'Support Vector Machine.']",,"The number of people enrolling in universities is rising due to the simplicity of applying and the benefit of earning a bachelor's degree. However, the on-time graduation rate has declined since plenty of students fail to complete their courses and take longer to get their diplomas. Even though there are various reasons leading to the aforementioned problem, it is crucial to emphasize the cause originating from the management and care of learners. In fact, understanding students' difficult situations and offering timely Number of Test data and advice would help prevent college dropouts or graduate delays. In this study, we present a machine learningbased method for early detection at-risk students, using data obtained from graduates of the Faculty of Information Technology, Dainam University, Vietnam. We experiment with several fundamental machine learning methods before implementing the parameter optimization techniques. In comparison to the other strategies, Random Forest and Grid Search (RF&GS) and Random Forest and Random Search (RF&RS) provided more accurate predictions for identifying at-risk students."
Application of Machine Learning in Prediction of Shear Capacity of Headed Steel Studs in Steel–Concrete Composite Structures,2022,"['Headed stud', 'Steel–concrete composite structure', 'Shear strength', 'Minimax probability machine regression', 'Extreme machine learning', 'Statistical modeling technique']",,"Headed studs are generally utilized as shear connectors at the interface between steel and concrete in composite structures primarily to transfer longitudinal shear force. This paper presents regression methodologies to predict the shear capacity of headed steel studs by using the concepts of minimax probability machine regression (MPMR) and extreme machine learning (EML). MPMR is carried out based on a minimax probability machine classifi cation. EML is an updated version of a single hidden layer feedforward network. From the experimental data presented in extensive literature, key input parameters infl uencing the shear capacity have been identifi ed and consolidated. The identifi ed parameters include (i) steel stud shank diameter, (ii) compressive strength of concrete, and (iii) tensile strength of headed steel stud. After careful examination of the data and their limits, about 70–75% of the mixed dataset comprising the range of the values has been used for developing MPMR and EML-based models. The input data has been normalized based on the limits of individual parameters. The remaining data has been utilized for verifi cation of the developed models. It is observed that the predicted shear strength capacity is comparable with the experimental observations. Further, the effi cacy of the models has been evaluated through several statistical parameters, namely; root mean square error, mean absolute error, the coeffi cient of effi ciency, root mean square error to observation’s standard deviation ratio, normalized mean bias error, performance index, and variance account factor. It is found that the R2 value is 0.9913 and 0.9479, respectively, for the models developed based on the concepts of MPMR and EML, indicating that the predicted value is closer to the experimental data."
Exploring modern machine learning methods to improve causal-effect estimation,2022,"['average causal effect', 'doubly-robust estimation', 'inverse probability weighting', 'propensity score', 'random forest', 'targeted learning']",,"This paper addresses the use of machine learning methods for causal estimation of treatment effects from observational data. Even though conducting randomized experimental trials is a gold standard to reveal potential causal relationships, observational study is another rich source for investigation of exposure effects, for example, in the research of comparative effectiveness and safety of treatments, where the causal effect can be identified if covariates contain all confounding variables. In this context, statistical regression models for the expected outcome and the probability of treatment are often imposed, which can be combined in a clever way to yield more efficient and robust causal estimators. Recently, targeted maximum likelihood estimation and causal random forest is proposed and extensively studied for the use of data-adaptive regression in estimation of causal inference parameters. Machine learning methods are a natural choice in these settings to improve the quality of the final estimate of the treatment effect. We explore how we can adapt the design and training of several machine learning algorithms for causal inference and study their finite-sample performance through simulation experiments under various scenarios. Application to the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) data shows that these adaptations can improve simple linear regression-based methods."
Application of Machine Learning Approaches to Predict Postnatal Growth Failure in Very Low Birth Weight Infants,2022,"['Growth failure', 'very low birth weight infants', 'machine learning', 'prediction', 'neonatal intensive care unit']",,"Purpose: The aims of the study were to develop and evaluate a machine learning model with which to predict postnatal growthfailure (PGF) among very low birth weight (VLBW) infants.Materials and Methods: Of 10425 VLBW infants registered in the Korean Neonatal Network between 2013 and 2017, 7954 infantswere included. PGF was defined as a decrease in Z score >1.28 at discharge, compared to that at birth. Six metrics [area under the re ceiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score] were obtained at five timepoints (at birth, 7 days, 14 days, 28 days after birth, and at discharge). Machine learning models were built using four different tech niques [extreme gradient boosting (XGB), random forest, support vector machine, and convolutional neural network] to compareagainst the conventional multiple logistic regression (MLR) model.Results: The XGB algorithm showed the best performance with all six metrics across the board. When compared with MLR, XGBshowed a significantly higher AUROC (p=0.03) for Day 7, which was the primary performance metric. Using optimal cut-off points,for Day 7, XGB still showed better performances in terms of AUROC (0.74), accuracy (0.68), and F1 score (0.67). AUROC valuesseemed to increase slightly from birth to 7 days after birth with significance, almost reaching a plateau after 7 days after birth.Conclusion: We have shown the possibility of predicting PGF through machine learning algorithms, especially XGB. Such mod els may help neonatologists in the early diagnosis of high-risk infants for PGF for early intervention."
MalDC: Malicious Software Detection and Classification using Machine Learning,2022,"['artificial intelligence', 'machine learning', 'malware classification', 'MalDC']",,"Recently, the importance and necessity of artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine learning, has been emphasized. In fact, studies are actively underway to solve complex and challenging problems through the use of AI systems, such as intelligent CCTVs, intelligent AI security systems, and AI surgical robots. Information security that involves analysis and response to security vulnerabilities of software is no exception to this and is recognized as one of the fields wherein significant results are expected when AI is applied. This is because the frequency of malware incidents is gradually increasing, and the available security technologies are limited with regard to the use of software security experts or source code analysis tools. We conducted a study on MalDC, a technique that converts malware into images using machine learning, MalDC showed good performance and was able to analyze and classify different types of malware. MalDC applies a preprocessing step to minimize the noise generated in the image conversion process and employs an image augmentation technique to reinforce the insufficient dataset, thus improving the accuracy of the malware classification. To verify the feasibility of our method, we tested the malware classification technique used by MalDC on a dataset provided by Microsoft and malware data collected by the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA). Consequently, an accuracy of 97% was achieved."
A Simple Method of Predicting Autumn Leaf Coloring Date Using Machine Learning with Spring Leaf Unfolding Date,2022,['Autumn leaf coloring date . Machine learning . Plant phenology . Prediction model . Spring leaf unfolding'],,"Predicting plant phenology is considered the foundational for the forecast of ecosystem function and dynamics from species level to global level. However, the exact prediction of plant phenology remains limited because of the challenges associated with adding exact environmental and physiological cues to numerical models. In this study, we developed a simple data-based prediction model for leaf coloring dates of temperate deciduous trees by applying machine learning to datasets obtained from the newly established South Korean national-scale phenology network (NPN). Ground observations of spring leaf unfolding dates for 2009–2018 obtained from NPN together with data on the environmental drivers of leaf coloring (summer mean temperature, altitude) were utilized for the model. The model can be evaluated to have simulated the characteristics of observed leaf coloring dates relatively accurate, with only a two-day difference between the average observed and predicted leaf coloring dates. In addition, the model yielded an RMSE value of approximately 7 days, which is within the acceptable error criteria when compared to the sampling frequency, despite the use of only three input variables. Data-based machine learning using existing spring leaf unfolding data as an input help us predict autumn phenology better, even without precise species-specific physiological knowledge on leaf coloring mechanisms. Consequently, a phenology network across the globe based on steady observations will be favorable datasets for a phenology prediction model that can be applied widely."

Besides, on the practical side, the Physical Activity for Smart Travel (PASTA) platform has been developed. Two groups of participants were recruited in Michigan and Texas to obtain the required data for the study. Daily activities have been classified into activities related to transportation (trips) and non-related to transportation (work, home, shopping, etc.), then focusing exclusively on transportation activities to determine their modes. In this study, four machine learning methods were used for prediction (Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine) and using the data of physical activities as a new feature not used in prior studies. The accuracy of the methods of transportation mode prediction was compared through the training and testing phases. The results of the predictions were compared with the activities verified by the participants. The results showed that the method of Random Forest performed better than other methods.

Integrating oversampling and ensemble-based machine learning techniques for an imbalanced dataset in dyslexia screening tests,2022,"['Dyslexia', 'Imbalanced data', 'Ensemble technique', 'Machine learning', 'Oversampling']",,"Developmental Dyslexia is a learning disorder often discovered in school-aged children who face difficulties while reading or spelling words even though they may have average or above-average levels of intelligence. This ultimately results in anger, frustration, low self-esteem, and other negative feelings. Early detection of Dyslexia can be highly beneficial for dyslexic children as their learning needs can be properly addressed. Researchers have used several testing techniques for early discovery where the data is collected from reading and writing tests, online games, Magnetic reasoning imaging (MRI) and Electroencephalography (EEG) scans, picture and video recording. Several Machine learning techniques have also been used in this regard recently. However, existing works did not focus on the problem of the imbalanced dataset where the percentage of dyslexic participants is much higher compared to non-dyslexic participants, which is expected to be the case for pre-screening among a random population. This paper addresses the imbalanced dataset obtained from dyslexia pre-screening tests and proposes an oversampling and ensemble-based machine learning technique for the detection of Dyslexia. Simulation results show that the proposed approach improves the detection accuracy of the minority class, i.e., dyslexic patients from 80.61% to 83.52%."
Experiment Study and Machine Learning Prediction of Damping Performance of Ferrofluid Dynamic Vibration Absorber,2022,"['ferrofluid', 'dynamic vibration absorber', 'machine learning', 'damping performance', 'neural network']",,"In this research, we study four influence factors of the damping performance of ferrofluid dynamic vibration absorber, as well as predict and optimize the damping performance by machine learning method. The vibration absorber in our research is based on the second order buoyancy principle, which consists of a non-magnetic container, a small amount of ferrofluid and a permanent magnet. The effects of the initial amplitude, the cone angle of the cover, the thickness of the gasket and the mass of the ferrofluid on the damping performance are investigated by experiments. Based on the experiment data, we use BP neural network to establish a prediction model between the four influence factors and the damping performance. The prediction error of damping efficiency predicted by BP neural network is mainly within ± 0.4%. Meanwhile, the determination coefficient R² of test data is 0.96242. The both indicate that BP neural network has a good performance in predicting the damping efficiency. Furthermore, we use the search algorithm to find the optimized values of each influence factor through the prediction model and the high damping efficiency is confirmed by experiments. Our work introduces machine learning into the field of vibration absorber designing, which provides an innovative method for the rapid design of high efficiency vibration absorber."

Ascertaining polarity of public opinions on Bangladesh cricket using machine learning techniques,2022,['Social media · Sentiment analysis · Public opinions · Cricket · Machine learning'],,"in the present world, we are not only the consumers of information but creators as well. The virtual world of social media, which is considered a free open forum for discussion; provides its participants a chance to shape or re-shape the digital information by expressing opinions. These opinions generally contain different types of sentiments. Sentiment analysis is a tool that performs the computational study of identifying and extracting sentiment content of textual data that can be used to classify those public opinions posted on various topics in social media. In this paper, a sentiment polarity detection approach is presented, that detects the polarity of textual Facebook posts in Bangla containing people’s point of views on Bangladesh Cricket using three popular supervised machine learning algorithms named Naive Bayes (NB), support vector machines (SVM), and logistic regression (LR). Comparative result analysis is also provided between classifiers, where LR performed slightly better than SVM and NB by considering n-gram as a feature with an accuracy of 83%."
Predicting the Compressive Strength and the Effective Porosity of Pervious Concrete Using Machine Learning Methods,2022,"['Pervious concrete', 'Compressive strength', 'Effective porosity', 'Machine learning', 'XGB']",,"This paper aims to develop a novel prediction tool based on the machine learning framework to evaluate the compressive strength and effective porosity of pervious concrete material from its compositions. To address this difficult task, 14 data sources were collected from the literature to build a dataset of 164 samples. The dataset included seven mixture design features (e.g., aggregate-to-cement ratio, water-to-cement ratio, minimum coarse aggregate size, the presence of sand or silica fume, effective porosity, and the compressive strength). This dataset was trained and tested by the most relevant machine learning methods: the extreme gradient boosting method (XGB), the random forest regression method, and the support vector machine method. The Particle Swarm Optimization method was applied to tune the models’ hyperparameters. It was observed that the extreme gradient boosting method significantly outperformed the accuracy of the other methods. Relatively high R-squared values of 0.92 and 0.88 were obtained for the compressive strength and effective porosity predictions. Furthermore, to account for the role of compaction, the original database was refined to obtain a 36 samples subset that considered compaction energy. Based on our assessment of this subset, results yielded superior R-squared values up to 0.99 for compressive strength, and 0.97 for effective porosity, revealing the effectiveness and accuracy of this research."

Methods: This studywas conducted using data from the Korean Frailty and Aging Cohort Study (KFACS). The KFACS participants were classifiedas robust or frail based on Fried’s frailty phenotype and excluded if they did not properly answer the questions, resulting in1,066 robust and 165 frail participants. We then selected influential features through feature selection and trained the modelusing support vector machine, random forest, and gradient boosting algorithms with the prepared dataset. Due to the imbalanceddistribution in the dataset with a low sample size, holdout was applied with stratified 10-fold and cross-validationfor estimating the model performance. The reliability of the constructed model was validated using an unseen test set. Themodel was then trained with hyperparameter optimization. Results: During the feature selection process, 27 features wereidentified as meaningful factors for frailty. The model was trained based on the selected features, and the weighted averageF1-score reached 95.30% with the random forest algorithm. Conclusions: The results of the study demonstrated the possibilityof adopting machine learning to strengthen existing frailty criteria. As the method analyzes questionnaire responses in ashort time, it can support higher volumes of data on participants’ health conditions and alert them regarding potential risksin advance."
Comparison of Research Topics on Transportation Decarbonization Between Asian and Non-Asian Regions: Using Topic Modeling and Machine Learning Algorithms,2022,"['Decarbonization', 'Transportation', 'Asia', 'Topic Modeling', 'Machine Learning']",,"The growing global interest to decarbonize the transportation industry has resulted in numerous scientific publications. This study reviews the rapidly expanding body of research and identifies the knowledge gaps in transport decarbonization between regions. This study employs a hybrid approach combining topic modeling and machine learning to identify research topics and their knowledge structures, and then compares the main debated topics between Asia and non-Asian regions. A dataset of 777 articles, including 410 Asian and 367 non-Asian articles, published between 1990 and 2022 was extracted from the Scopus database. The latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling results showed that five potential topics were derived from Asia, while six were derived from non-Asian regions, and the knowledge structure of each topic differed between the two regions. The K-nearest neighbor machine learning algorithm results indicated a 92% accuracy for Asian topics and an 89% accuracy for non-Asian topics. The findings suggest that the Asian studies focused on “energy use in transportation” and “drivers of CO2 emissions in transportation,” while the non-Asian studies focused on “electric vehicles” and “fuel consumption.” This paper will keep academics and practitioners updated on the paradigm shift in the research on transportation decarbonization."

To deal with accident scenarios more effectively, operators must have ample and precise information about key safety parameters as well as their future trajectories. This work investigates the potential of machine learning in forecasting NPP response in real-time to provide an additional validation method and help reduce human error, especially in accident situations where operators are under a lot of stress. First, a base-case SGTR simulation is carried out by the best-estimate code RELAP5/MOD3.4 to confirm the validity of the model against results reported in the APR1400 Design Control Document (DCD). Then, uncertainty quantification is performed by coupling RELAP5/MOD3.4 and the statistical tool DAKOTA to generate a large enough dataset for the construction and training of neural-based machine learning (ML) models, namely LSTM, GRU, and hybrid CNN-LSTM. Finally, the accuracy and reliability of these models in forecasting system response are tested by their performance on fresh data. To facilitate and oversee the process of developing the ML models, a Systems Engineering (SE) methodology is used to ensure that the work is consistently in line with the originating mission statement and that the findings obtained at each subsequent phase are valid."
Machine learning analysis of broadband optical reflectivity of semiconductor thin film,2022,"['Optical spectroscopy', 'Machine learning', 'Infrared reflection']",,"Broadband reflection spectroscopy is a non-invasive and non-contact tool widely used to measure optical dielectric constants and thickness of thin films. However, a lot of time and effort are consumed to analyze data before the results can be attained.Here we construct an artificial neural network (ANN) using scattering matrix formalism and U-net architecture, and apply it to analyze infrared reflection of SiO2 thin film grown on Si substrate. The ANN returns multiple outputs—frequencydependent optical refractive index (n), absorption coefficient( ), and thickness of the film (d)—with high precision with 0.6 nm thickness difference. Furthermore, the ANN can fit large number of reflection data taken at numerous positions (500) of the thin film in short time less than 150 ms, and creates fine-scale thickness map with 0.6 nm thickness resolution. This work demonstrates that U-net-based ANN is a powerful method of reflectivity analysis and can be applied to other thin-film materials."
Machine Learning Methods to Predict Vehicle Fuel Consumption,2022,,,"It's proposed and analyzed ML(Machine Learning) models to predict vehicle FC(Fuel Consumption) in real-time. The test driving was done for a car to measure vehicle speed, acceleration, road gradient and FC for training dataset. The various ML models were trained with feature data of speed, acceleration and road-gradient for target FC. There are two kind of ML models and one is regression type of linear regression and k-nearest neighbors regression and the other is classification type of k-nearest neighbors classifier, logistic regression, decision tree, random forest and gradient boosting in the study. The prediction accuracy is low in range of 0.5 ~ 0.6 for real-time FC and the classification type is more accurate than the regression ones. The prediction error for total FC has very low value of about 0.2 ~ 2.0% and regression models are more accurate than classification ones. It's for the coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) of accuracy score distributing predicted values along mean of targets as the coefficient decreases. Therefore regression models are good for total FC and classification ones are proper for real-time FC prediction."
Compact feature hashing for machine learning based malware detection,2022,"['Feature hashing', 'Feature vector', 'Machine learning', 'Malware detection']",,"Machine learning can detect variant malware files that can evade signature-based detection. Feature hashing is used to convert features into a fixed-length vector. In this paper, we study the appropriate vector size for feature hashing for a large dataset of malware files. Through exhaustive experiments on more than 280,000 real malware and benign files, we find for the first time that the default vector size of current feature hashing practices is unnecessarily large. We experimentally explore the appropriate vector size, which not only reduces memory space by 70% but also increases the detection accuracy, compared with the state-of-the-art scheme."

Unsupervised Machine Learning to Identify Depressive Subtypes,2022,"['Psychiatry', 'Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Informatics']",,"Objectives: This study evaluated an unsupervised machine learning method, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), as a methodfor identifying subtypes of depression within symptom data. Methods: Data from 18,314 depressed patients were used to createLDA models. The outcomes included future emergency presentations, crisis events, and behavioral problems. One modelwas chosen for further analysis based upon its potential as a clinically meaningful construct. The associations between patientgroups created with the final LDA model and outcomes were tested. These steps were repeated with a commonly-usedlatent variable model to provide additional context to the LDA results. Results: Five subtypes were identified using the finalLDA model. Prior to the outcome analysis, the subtypes were labeled based upon the symptom distributions they produced:psychotic, severe, mild, agitated, and anergic-apathetic. The patient groups largely aligned with the outcome data. For example,the psychotic and severe subgroups were more likely to have emergency presentations (odds ratio [OR] = 1.29; 95% confidenceinterval [CI], 1.17–1.43 and OR = 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05–1.29, respectively), whereas these outcomes were less likely inthe mild subgroup (OR = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.78–0.94). We found that the LDA subtypes were characterized by clusters of uniquesymptoms. This contrasted with the latent variable model subtypes, which were largely stratified by severity. Conclusions:This study suggests that LDA can surface clinically meaningful, qualitative subtypes. Future work could be incorporated intostudies concerning the biological bases of depression, thereby contributing to the development of new psychiatric therapeutics."

To solve these three problems, we use an IBVS based on KF, African vultures optimization algorithm enhanced extreme learning machine (AVOA-ELM), and fuzzy logic (FL) in this paper. Firstly, KF online estimation of the Jacobian matrix. We propose an AVOA-ELM error compensation model to compensate for the sub-optimal estimation of the KF to solve the problems of disturbance noises and noise statistics error. Next, an FL controller is designed for gain adaptation. This approach addresses the problem of the slow convergence of the IBVS system with the KF. Then, we propose a visual servoing scheme combining FL and KF-AVOA-ELM (FL-KF-AVOA-ELM). Finally, we verify the algorithm on the 6-DOF robotic manipulator PUMA 560. Compared with the existing methods, our algorithm can solve the three problems mentioned above without camera parameters, robot kinematics model, and target depth information. We also compared the proposed method with other KF-based IBVS methods under different disturbance noise environments. And the proposed method achieves the best results under the three evaluation metrics."

In this study, we developed an explainable machine learning to predict thepossibility of red blood cell transfusion for major medical diseases in the ICU. Target disease groups thatreceived packed red blood cell transfusions at high frequency were selected and 16,222 patients were finallyextracted. The prediction model achieved an area under the ROC curve of 0.9070 and an F1-score of 0.8166(LightGBM).

Recently, the machine learning (ML) approach, which is one aspect of regression methods, has been gaining attention from researchers, including social science, but there are only a few studies that compared the traditional approaches with the ML approach. This study was conducted to explore the usefulness of the ML approach by comparing the ordinary least square estimate (OLS), the stochastic gradient descent algorithm (SGD), and the support vector regression (SVR) with a model predicting and explaining the tuberculosis screening intention. The optimized models were evaluated by four aspects: computational speed, effect and importance of individual predictor, and model performance. The result demonstrated that each model yielded a similar direction of effect and importance in each predictor, and the SVR with the radial kernel had the finest model performance compared to its computational speed. Finally, this study discussed the usefulness and attentive points of the ML approach when a researcher utilizes it in the field of communication."

A Random Forests (RF) based real-time queue length estimation method is proposed using the vehicle Global Position System (GPS) trajectory and License Plate Recognition (LPR ) Data. The RF model is trained to predict the vehicle stop locations provided by the GPS data by features of traffic flow characteristics extracted from the LRP data. The predicted stop locations are further used to estimate the cyclic maximum queue length for each approach lane. The proposed method has been implemented on sixteen lanes of eight links from both major and minor arterials in Kunshan City, China. Key findings and conclusions include: 1) By feature selection, the travel time has the most significant impact on the prediction accuracy of the vehicle stop location, and the number of departed vehicles is the secondary informative feature. 2) The RF model achieves a satisfying accuracy for the stop location prediction and cyclic maximum queue length estimation, which has the best performance with a larger sample size in the training data. 3) Comparative analysis also shows the superiorities of the proposed model to have more accurate results by incorporating comprehensive features and a machine learning process."
A Study on the Detection Method for Malicious URLs Based on a Number of Search Results Matching the Internet Search Engines Combining the Machine Learning,2022,"['Malicious URL', 'Machine learning', 'Phishing', 'Count', 'Search engine']",,"With the development of IoT technology, everything in our daily lives became connected, forming a hyperconnected society.Subsequently, the importance of cyber security is being emphasized. Among them, cyber-attacks using malicious URLs have emerged as an addressing the issue of social problems. Malicious URLs are used by attackers with malicious purposes such as smishing, pharming, and phishing to steal user's information using abnormal URLs. In order to detect and block such malicious URL attacks, it is best that individuals not click on suspicious URL addresses. However, this is diffi cult because the contents that contain the URLs are alluring. Before, malicious URLs were detected through Blacklist/Whitelist techniques, but they couldn't protect users from new and variant attacks. On this, a malicious URL detection method based on the diff erence in length (amount of search volume) of normal and abnormal URLs was studied using the search engines.However, this technique showed little diff erence in the search volume of normal/abnormal URLs when searched from a low-profi le URL. In addition when an abnormal URL is very similar to the original URL, there is almost no diff erence in the search volume since abnormal URLs change the automatic search of the portal site's search engine, making it impossible to be detected. To solve these, in this paper, we propose a malicious URL detection method based on Count which is a number of search results matching the search URL."
Beta and Alpha Regularizers of Mish Activation Functions for Machine Learning Applications in Deep Neural Networks,2022,"['Neural Network', 'Machine Learning Applications', 'α and β Regularizers', 'Activation Function.']",,"A very complex task in deep learning such as image classification must be solved with the help of neural networks and activation functions. The backpropagation algorithm advances backward from the output layer towards the input layer, the gradients often get smaller and smaller and approach zero which eventually leaves the weights of the initial or lower layers nearly unchanged, as a result, the gradient descent never converges to the optimum. We propose a two-factor non-saturating activation functions known as Bea-Mish for machine learning applications in deep neural networks. Our method uses two factors, beta (β) and alpha (α), to normalize the area below the boundary in the Mish activation function and we regard these elements as Bea. Bea-Mish provide a clear understanding of the behaviors and conditions governing this regularization term can lead to a more principled approach for constructing better performing activation functions. We evaluate Bea-Mish results against Mish and Swish activation functions in various models and data sets. Empirical results show that our approach (Bea-Mish) outperforms native Mish using SqueezeNet backbone with an average precision (AP50val) of 2.51% in CIFAR-10 and top-1accuracy in ResNet-50 on ImageNet-1k. shows an improvement of 1.20%."

Here, we aimed to prospectively validate the accuracy of these models.Materials and Methods: Probabilities of the need for intensive care [intensive care unit (ICU) score] and oxygen (oxygen score)were calculated from information provided by hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n=44) via a web-based application. The performanceof baseline scores to predict 30-day outcomes was assessed.Results: Among 44 patients, 5 and 15 patients needed intensive care and oxygen, respectively. The area under the curve of ICUscore and oxygen score to predict 30-day outcomes were 0.774 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.614–0.934] and 0.728 (95% CI:0.559–0.898), respectively.

Predicting As Contamination Risk in Red River Delta using Machine Learning Algorithms,2022,"['groundwater arsenic', 'machine learning', 'predictive model', 'random forest', 'gradient boosting']",,"Excessive presence of As level in groundwater is a major health problem worldwide. In the Red River Delta in Vietnam, several million residents possess a high risk of chronic As poisoning. The As releases into groundwater caused by natural process through microbially-driven reductive dissolution of Fe (III) oxides. It has been extracted by Red River residents using private tube wells for drinking and daily purposes because of their unawareness of the contamination. This long-term consumption of As-contaminated groundwater could lead to various health problems. Therefore, a predictive model would be useful to expose contamination risks of the wells in the Red River Delta Vietnam area. This study used four machine learning algorithms to predict the As probability of study sites in Red River Delta, Vietnam. The GBM was the best performing model with the accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity of 98.7%, 100%, 95.2%, and 100%, respectively. In addition, it resulted the highest AUC of 92% and 96% for the PRC and ROC curves, with Eh and Fe as the most important variables. The partial dependence plot of As concentration on the model parameters showed that the probability of high level of As is related to the low number of wells’ depth, Eh, and SO₄, along with high PO₄³⁻ and NH₄⁺. This condition triggers the reductive dissolution of iron phases, thus releasing As into groundwater."
Use of Machine Learning for modelling the wear of MgO-C refractories in Basic Oxygen Furnace,2022,"['Basic oxygen furnace', 'Refractories', 'Machine learning', 'MgO-C.']",,"Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF), TBM type (Thyssen – Blas – Metallurgie) is one of the heat units occurring in a steel productionprocess.

Artificial Intelligence Based Machine Learning Models Predict Sperm Parameter Upgrading after Varicocele Repair: A Multi-Institutional Analysis,2022,"['Artificial intelligence', 'Fertility', 'Patient-specific modeling', 'Sperm count', 'Varicocele']",,"Purpose: Varicocele repair is recommended in the presence of a clinical varicocele together with at least one abnormal semen parameter, and male infertility. Unfortunately, up to 50% of men who meet criteria for repair will not see meaningful benefit in outcomes despite successful treatment. We developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict which men with varicocele will benefit from treatment.Materials and Methods: We identified men with infertility, clinical varicocele, and at least one abnormal semen parameter from two large urology centers in North America (Miami and Toronto) between 2006 and 2020. We collected pre and postoperative clinical and hormonal data following treatment. Clinical upgrading was defined as an increase in sperm concentration that would allow a couple to access previously unavailable reproductive options. The tiers used for upgrading were: 1–5 million/mL (ICSI/IVF), 5–15 million/mL (IUI) and >15 million/mL (natural conception). Thus moving from ICSI/IVF to IUI, or from IUI to natural conception, would be considered an upgrade. AI models were trained and tested using R to predict which patients were likely to upgrade after surgery. The model sorted men into categories that defined how likely they were to upgrade after surgery (likely, equivocal, and unlikely).Results: Data from 240 men were included from both centers. A total of 45.6% of men experienced an upgrade in sperm concentration following surgery, 48.1% did not change, and 6.3% downgraded. The data from Miami were used to create a random forest model for predicting upgrade in sperm concentration. On external validation using Toronto data, the model accurately predicted upgrade in 87% of men deemed likely to improve, and in 49% and 36% of men who were equivocal and unlikely to improve, respectively. Overall, the personalized prediction for patients in the validation cohort was accurate (AUC 0.72).Conclusions: A machine learning model performed well in predicting clinically meaningful post-varicocelectomy sperm parameters using pre-operative hormonal, clinical, and semen analysis data. To our knowledge, this is the first prediction model to show the utility of hormonal data, as well as the first to use machine learning models to predict clinically meaningful upgrading. This model will be published online as a clinical calculator that can be used in the preoperative counseling of patients."

An efficient computational model that evaluates the electronic properties of molecules accurately would be a useful tool for discovering novel fluorophores. Tree-based ensemble and graph neural network (GNN) methods have been regarded as attractive models for predicting molecular properties. Here, we present a benchmark test using three tree-based ensemble methods (Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost) and three GNNs (directed message passing neural network [D-MPNN], attention message passing neural network [AMPNN], and DimeNet++) for predicting electronic transition properties such as excitation energies and oscillator strengths. From our benchmark, DimeNet++ was identified as the most accurate model to predict electronic transition properties. The average root mean square error of DimeNet++ for predicting the HOMO–LUMO gap was 0.11 eV whereas those of the other methods exceeded 0.3 eV. D-MPNN predicted fastest without sacrificing accuracy. Our results show that DimeNet++ and D-MPNN may serve as helpful evaluators for novel fluorophore design when combined with molecular generation methods."
Estimation of Seasonal Representation of the Sea Water Temperature Profile Using Machine Learning and Its Effect on the Prediction of Underwater Acoustic Detection Performance,2022,"['K-means clustering', 'Machine learning', 'Salinity profile', 'Seawater temperature profile', 'SONAR detection']",,"Seawater temperature and salinity profiles are important physical properties that represent oceanic environments and affect underwater acoustic detection prediction performance. Average ocean data can be used to predict the SONAR detection area in areas where obtaining real-time ocean data or instantly predicting the SONAR detection area is difficult. However, it can yield distorted results. In this study, representative temperature profiles reflecting properties of the vertical structure at various temperatures in the study area were obtained using K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique. K-means clustering was applied to the temperature profiles obtained from the three stations of the Ulleung Basin in the East Sea. In addition, the physical characteristics of the representative profiles obtained were compared, and the representativeness of the acoustic detection area obtained from the representative profiles was evaluated. In summer, when the mixed layer was thin, each cluster was classified according to the vertical temperature gradient of the thermocline. In winter, the clusters were classified according to the mixed layer and thermocline depths, rather than the vertical temperature gradient of the thermocline. For each obtained cluster, the acoustic detection area was calculated using all the profiles and displayed as a histogram. The acoustic detection area calculated from the representative profile of the cluster was generally close to the average of the acoustic detection area. Thus, K-means clustering can effectively classify temperature profiles physically and acoustically and can potentially be applied in other regions for the classification and analysis of seawater temperature and salinity profiles."

The performance of the six ML models on the internal testing dataset was good, with both the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision−recall curve (AUPRC) ranging from 0.92 to 0.94. Although the AUROC of all models on the external testing dataset (2018 KYRBS) ranged from 0.93 to 0.95, the AUPRC of the models was approximately 0.5. Conclusion: The developed and validated SA prediction models can be applied to detect high risks of SA. This approach could facilitate early intervention in the suicide crisis and may ultimately contribute to suicide prevention for adolescents."

Classification of the accidental background of delayed neutron captured on hydrogen using machine learning algorithm,2022,"['Neutrino', 'Decision Tree', 'Machine Learning', 'Accidental background']",,"Neutrinos are captured on free protons through inverse beta decay (IBD). Among the backgrounds of IBD events, the accidental background is dominant in hydrogen analysis(delayed neutrons are captured on hydrogen : n-H). The accidental background is due to the random association of two signal-like events. Due to the low energy criteria of delayed signals, the random backgrounds remain larger than those captured on Gadolinium (Gd). In this study, we classified the accidental random background from IBD candidate events using a machine learning algorithm and compared the results with RENO n-H’s for the classification degree of the backgrounds."
Use of multi-hybrid machine learning and deep artificial intelligence in the prediction of compressive strength of concrete containing admixtures,2022,"['ANN', 'compressive strength prediction', 'fly ash', 'grey wolf optimization', 'metakaolin', 'RBF', 'SVR']",,"Conventional concrete needs some improvement in the mechanical properties, which can be obtained by different admixtures. However, making concrete samples costume always time and money. In this paper, different types of hybrid algorithms are applied to develop predictive models for forecasting compressive strength (CS) of concretes containing metakaolin (MK) and fly ash (FA). In this regard, three different algorithms have been used, namely multilayer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function (RBF), and support vector machine (SVR), to predict CS of concretes by considering most influencers input variables. These algorithms integrated with the grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm to increase the model's accuracy in predicting (GWMLP, GWRBF, and GWSVR). The proposed MLP models were implemented and evaluated in three different layers, wherein each layer, GWO, fitted the best neuron number of the hidden layer. Correspondingly, the key parameters of the SVR model are identified using the GWO method. Also, the optimization algorithm determines the hidden neurons' number and the spread value to set the RBF structure. The results show that the developed models all provide accurate predictions of the CS of concrete incorporating MK and FA with R<sup>2</sup> larger than 0.9972 and 0.9976 in the learning and testing stage, respectively. Regarding GWMLP models, the GWMLP1 model outperforms other GWMLP networks. All in all, GWSVR has the worst performance with the lowest indices, while the highest score belongs to GWRBF."
Water consumption prediction based on machine learning methods and public data,2022,"['artificial neural network', 'machine learning', 'multi-layer perceptron', 'multiple linear regression', 'predictive model', 'stepwise regression', 'support vector regression', 'water consumption']",,"Water consumption is strongly affected by numerous factors, such as population, climatic, geographic, and socio-economic factors. Therefore, the implementation of a reliable predictive model of water consumption pattern is challenging task. This study investigates the performance of predictive models based on multi-layer perceptron (MLP), multiple linear regression (MLR), and support vector regression (SVR). To understand the significant factors affecting water consumption, the stepwise regression (SW) procedure is used in MLR to obtain suitable variables. Then, this study also implements three predictive models based on these significant variables (e.g., SWMLR, SWMLP, and SWSVR). Annual data of water consumption in Thailand during 2006 - 2015 were compiled and categorized by provinces and distributors. By comparing the predictive performance of models with all variables, the results demonstrate that the MLP models outperformed the MLR and SVR models. As compared to the models with selected variables, the predictive capability of SWMLP was superior to SWMLR and SWSVR. Therefore, the SWMLP still provided satisfactory results with the minimum number of explanatory variables which in turn reduced the computation time and other resources required while performing the predictive task. It can be concluded that the MLP exhibited the best result and can be utilized as a reliable water demand predictive model for both of all variables and selected variables cases. These findings support important implications and serve as a feasible water consumption predictive model and can be used for water resources management to produce sufficient tap water to meet the demand in each province of Thailand."

PREDICTION OF DRIVER’S DROWSINESS USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR MINIMAL RISK CONDITION,2022,"['Driver drowsiness', 'Minimal risk condition', 'Light fatigue', 'Severe fatigue', 'Vehicle driving data', 'Machine learning algorithms']",,"Use of an Automated Driving System is expected to improve traffic safety by protecting drivers from drowsy driving. Previous studies on the use of Automated Driving Systems mainly focused on detecting a driver’s level of drowsiness and protecting drivers from accidents by performing fallback maneuvers. However, maneuvers conducted in drowsy states are limited in their ability to achieve Minimal Risk Conditions because human drivers show a gradual degradation in their driving ability as they fall asleep and the probability of an accident increases greatly after a driver becomes drowsy. Thus, current Automated Driving Systems require algorithms to predict drowsiness and perform maneuvers before the driver becomes too drowsy. This paper suggests an algorithm that not only detects but also predicts driver drowsiness using 6 vehicle data points.Driver condition is classified into 4 states and Driver drowsiness can be predicted by detecting the severe fatigue state, which tends to occur one minute before the drowsy state. The vehicle driving data are collected using a simulator and features that can be used to distinguish between the 4 states are investigated through data analysis. Ultimat"

Comparison of survival prediction models for pancreatic cancer: Cox model versus machine learning models,2022,"['Cox model', 'random survival forests', 'support vector machines', 'survival prediction model']",,"A survival prediction model has recently been developed to evaluate the prognosis of resected nonmetastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma based on a Cox model using two nationwide databases: Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) and Korea Tumor Registry System-Biliary Pancreas (KOTUS-BP). In this study, we applied two machine learning methods-random survival forests (RSF) and support vector machines (SVM)-for survival analysis and compared their prediction performance using the SEER and KOTUS-BP datasets. Three schemes were used for model development and evaluation. First, we utilized data from SEER for model development and used data from KOTUS-BP for external evaluation. Second, these two datasets were swapped by taking data from KOTUS-BP for model development and data from SEER for external evaluation. Finally, we mixed these two datasets half and half and utilized the mixed datasets for model development and validation. We used 9,624 patients from SEER and 3,281 patients from KOTUS-BP to construct a prediction model with seven covariates: age, sex, histologic differentiation, adjuvant treatment, resection margin status, and the American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th edition T-stage and N-stage. Comparing the three schemes, the performance of the Cox model, RSF, and SVM was better when using the mixed datasets than when using the unmixed datasets. When using the mixed datasets, the C-index, 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year time-dependent areas under the curve for the Cox model were 0.644, 0.698, 0.680, and 0.687, respectively. The Cox model performed slightly better than RSF and SVM."
Investigation of the strength of concrete-like material with waste rock and aeolian sand as aggregate by machine learning,2022,"['solid waste', 'filling mining', 'response surface methodology', 'machine learning', 'mix proportion']",,"Solid waste filling is an important development direction for filling mining technology. This paper proposes to use waste rock and aeolian sand as aggregates to fill the underground extraction area in order to reduce the environmental damage of related waste solid. The experiments are optimized by response surface methodology and multivariate nonlinear response models are constructed to investigate the effects of different factors on uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of concrete-like material (CLM). The performance of different swarm intelligence optimization algorithms is analyzed and combined with support vector regression model (SVR) to construct an intelligent prediction model for UCS. The results show that the packing density has a maximum value of 0.74 when the proportion of waste rock is around 0.6. The response model constructed in this paper has a P-value < 0.01 and R2 > 0.8, which indicates its high significance and goodness of fit. The UCS of CLM increases with the increase of cement content and slurry mass fraction, while it also increases and then decreases with the increase of proportion of waste rock. The ratio of waste rock and aeolian sand will affect the compactness of cemented structure. The better the ratio, the higher the average grey value of the cemented structure, the more compactness the cemented structure. The whale optimization algorithm-SVR model constructed in this paper has a prediction accuracy of more than 99% for UCS of CLM, which achieves high accuracy and fast prediction of UCS under multifactor conditions."

Mechanical fault detection based on machine learning for robotic RV reducer using electrical current signature analysis: a data-driven approach,2022,"['prognostics and health management (PHM)', 'rotate vector (RV) reducer fault detection and isolation', 'motor current signature analysis (MCSA)', 'feature selection', 'feature optimization', 'machine learning (ML)']",,"Recently, prognostic and health management (PHM) has become a prominent field in modern industry. The rotate vector (RV) reducer is one of the widely used mechanical components in industrial systems, specifically in robots. The RV reducer is known for its unique characteristics of small size, efficient speed transmission, and high torsion. The RV reducer is prone to several kinds of faults, due to its continuous operation in an industrial robot. To keep the operation smooth and steady, timely PHM of the RV reducer has become essential. Previously, the RV reducer fault was diagnosed via various techniques, such as ferrography analysis, vibration analysis, and acoustic emission analysis. However, these conventional techniques have various issues. To resolve those issues, we introduce a novel approach to use the embedded electrical current system for the fault detection of the RV reducer. However, this is quite complicated to investigate mechanical fault using an electrical current signature, since the RV reducer is not an integral part of the electric motor, and finding a fault pattern in faulty components needs thorough examination. We therefore focus on the application of machine learning (ML) for fault classifications. We present an approach for feature extraction, feature selection, and feature reduction using the information obtained from the motor current signature analysis to create an ML-based fault classification system with distinguishable prominent features. Finally, the authenticity of the presented approach is justified via the improved values of evaluating parameters, such as accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity, for ML classifiers."
A Novel Power Transformer Fault Diagnosis Model Based on Harris-Hawks-Optimization Algorithm Optimized Kernel Extreme Learning Machine,2022,"['Dissolved gas analysis (DGA)', 'Kernel extreme learning machine (KELM)', 'Harris-Hawks optimization (HHO)', 'Transformer fault diagnosis']",,"Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) method is widely used to detect the incipient fault of power transformers.

Incipient fault diagnosis for centrifugal chillers using kernel entropy component analysis and voting based extreme learning machine,2022,"['Operational Safety', 'Fault Diagnosis', 'Water Chillers', 'Extreme Learning Machine', 'Kernel Entropy Component Analysis']",,"Incipient fault detection and diagnosis for centrifugal chillers is significant for maintaining safe and effective system operation. Due to the advantages of simple learning algorithm and high generalization capability, the extreme learning machine (ELM) can identify faults quickly and precisely in comparison to conventional classification methods such as back propagation neural network (BPNN). This paper reports an effective diagnosis method for incipient chiller faults with the integration of kernel entropy component analysis (KECA) and voting based ELM (VELM). KECA was first performed to reduce the dimensionality of the original input data so as to minimize the model complexity and computational cost. Instead of using a single ELM, multiple independent ELMs were adopted in VELM, and then the class label could be predicted based on the majority voting method. Using the experimental data of seven typical faults together with a normal operation, the proposed KECA-VELM fault diagnostic model was trained and further validated. The results show that a better fault diagnosis performance can be achieved using the KECA-VELM classifier compared with the conventional BPNN, ELM and VELM based classifiers. The overall average fault diagnosis accuracy for the faults at the least severity level was reported over 95% based on the proposed method."

Since customers increasingly rely on online reviews to search for more detailed information about products or services before purchasing, many researchers focus on detecting manipulated reviews. However, the main problem in detecting manipulated reviews is the difficulties with obtaining data with manipulated reviews to utilize machine learning techniques with sufficient data. Also, the number of manipulated reviews is insufficient compared with the number of non-manipulated reviews, so the class imbalance problem occurs. The class with fewer examples is under-represented and can hamper a model’s accuracy, so machine learning methods suffer from the class imbalance problem and solving the class imbalance problem is important to build an accurate model for detecting manipulated reviews. Thus, we propose an OpenAI-based reviews generation model to solve the manipulated reviews imbalance problem, thereby enhancing the accuracy of manipulated reviews detection. In this research, we applied the novel autoregressive language model -GPT-3 to generate reviews based on manipulated reviews. Moreover, we found that applying GPT-3 model for oversampling manipulated reviews can recover a satisfactory portion of performance losses and shows better performance in classification (logit, decision tree, neural networks) than traditional oversampling models such as random oversampling and SMOTE."

Therefore, we aimed to create various DM prediction models using easily accessible health screening test parameters.Methods: Two sets of variables were used to develop eight DM prediction models. One set comprised 62 easily accessible examination results of commonly used variables from a tertiary university hospital. The second set comprised 27 of the 62 variables included in the national routine health checkups. Gradient boosting and random forest algorithms were used to develop the models. Internal validation was performed using the stratified 10-fold cross-validation method.Results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) for the 62-variable DM model making 12-month predictions for subjects without diabetes was the largest (0.928) among those of the eight DM prediction models. The ROC-AUC dropped by more than 0.04 when training with the simplified 27-variable set but still showed fairly good performance with ROC-AUCs between 0.842 and 0.880. The accuracy was up to 11.5% higher (from 0.807 to 0.714) when fasting glucose was included.Conclusion: We created easily applicable diabetes prediction models that deliver good performance using parameters commonly assessed during tertiary university hospital and national routine health checkups. We plan to perform prospective external validation, hoping that the developed DM prediction models will be widely used in clinical practice."

Discrete Sizing Optimization of Truss Structures Using Continuous Optimization and Machine Learning Tools,2022,"['Truss Structure', 'Sizing Optimization', 'Discrete Design', 'Continuous Optimization', 'Machine Learning']",,"This research proposes a series of design procedures for discrete sizing optimization of truss structures. Most discrete sizing optimization methods for truss structures adopt stochastic approaches using metaheuristic algorithms. However, such methods involve many structural analyses until they find a discrete optimal solution, which is expensive. The primary motivation of this research is to suggest a discrete design while reducing the number of structural analyses as many as possible. First, the structural optimization software GENESIS performs sizing optimization in a continuous design space using proven techniques. This provides an excellent optimal solution, and the proposed method is applied while assuming that the discrete optimal solution exists near the continuous optimum design. For discrete sizing optimization of a truss structure, approximate models are generated near the continuous optimum point using the scikit-learn-one capability of machine learning libraries, leading to a simple optimization problem. Then, the python library, PyGAD, is used to obtain a discrete optimal solution. Compared with existing methods, this research provides discrete designs requiring only 0.38-52.0% of the number of structural analyses performed in other studies."

The actual power output is calculated from the wind data generated by the numerical weather prediction, and its temporal resolution is 1 hour. The R-square (R 2 ) values of the models range from 0.97 to 0.98 while adopting the average value of daily wind speed as the input data, and it increases by -1 % with the additional input data of the standard deviation of wind speed. The power production is predicted based on the wind data at a relatively lower height of 10 m than the hub height, where the R 2 value ranges from 0.95 to 0.98. The results could provide the possibility of replacing the wind data measurement process at the hub height by that at a relatively lower height, reducing the cost of wind data measurement."
Classification of ultrasonic signals of thermally aged cast austenitic stainless steel (CASS) using machine learning (ML) models,2022,"['Cast austenitic stainless steel (CASS)', 'Thermal aging', 'Ultrasonic technique', 'Machine learning (ML)', 'Classification']",,"Cast austenitic stainless steels (CASSs) are widely used as structural materials in the nuclear industry. Themain drawback of CASSs is the reduction in fracture toughness due to long-term exposure to operatingenvironment. Even though ultrasonic non-destructive testing has been conducted in major nuclearcomponents and pipes, the detection of cracks is difficult due to the scattering and attenuation of ultrasonic waves by the coarse grains and the inhomogeneity of CASS materials. In this study, the ultrasonicsignals measured in thermally aged CASS were discriminated for the first time with the simple ultrasonictechnique (UT) and machine learning (ML) models. Several different ML models, specifically the Knearest neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models,were used to classify the ultrasonic signals as thermal aging condition of CASS specimens.

Optimization of long-term planning with a constraint satisfaction problem algorithm with a machine learning,2022,"['Long-term planning', 'Berth planning', 'Capacity planning', 'Constraint satisfaction problem', 'Optimization', 'Machine learning', 'Deep neural network']",,"The object of the long-term planning in shipyards is to assign the ordered vessels to the berths with the consideration of the workload balancing. However, there are limitations in establishing an optimized long-term plan because the workload balancing takes too much time due to the size and the complexity of the problem domain. Most shipyards currently overcome the limitations by dividing the long-term planning into two-phase of the berth planning and the capacity planning. The berth planning is being conducted with a heuristic method by considering some rules such as the berth priority and the closeness to delivery date. Then it is followed by the capacity planning, in which the workload data is considered for the workload balancing with the previously planned data. However, the heuristic method has a fundamental problems that the optimized solution is not guaranteed owing to the limits of the search range. Also, the previous production record cannot reflect the newly ordered vessel's workload precisely. In this study, a constraint satisfaction technique is used for the optimization of the berth planning. In addition, the workload prediction model is developed based on the supervised learning with a deep neural network. Finally, proposed methods are tested with the shipyard actual data, that shows the improved results."

Model and Optimize the Magnetic Composite Fluid (MCF) Polishing Process with Machine Learning Modeling and Intelligent Optimization Algorithm,2022,"['Magnetic composite fluid polishing', 'Particle swarm optimization algorithm', 'Polishing parameters', 'Surface roughness']",,"In the magnetic composite fluid (MCF) polishing process, appropriate polishing parameters are the basis of achieving high-quality polishing without damage. Appropriate polishing parameters are mainly based on an accurate polishing model and an excellent polishing parameters optimization algorithm. However, due to the complicated principle of MCF polishing and various influencing elements, traditional modeling methods have the limitations of low accuracy, poor application, and difficulty in correcting. Therefore, it is challenging to obtain the optimal polishing quality by optimizing the polishing parameters based on the traditional model. This study proposed an online modeling approach considering data cleaning based on machine learning modeling, and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was used to optimize polishing parameters. Then, copper polishing experiments were carried out to validate the modeling and optimization methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed machine learning online modeling method can establish an accurate MCF polishing model, and the nano-scale fine polishing of copper can be achieved by the optimized polishing parameters of PSO, and the surface roughness of the copper sample was reduced by 85% to 0.031 μm."

A new machine learning based approach is proposed to model gamma-ray shieldingbehavior of composites alternative to theoretical calculations. Two fuzzy logic algorithms and a neuralnetwork algorithm were trained and tested with different mixture ratios of vanadium slag/epoxy resin/antimony in the 0.05 MeVe2 MeV energy range. Two of the algorithms showed excellent agreementwith testing data after optimizing adjustable parameters, with root mean squared error (RMSE) valuesdown to 0.0001. Those results are remarkable because mass attenuation coefficients are often presentedwith four significant figures. Different training data sizes were tried to determine the least number ofdata points required to train sufficient models. Data set size more than 1000 is seen to be required tomodel in above 0.05 MeV energy. Below this energy, more data points with finer energy resolution mightbe required. Neuro-fuzzy models were three times faster to train than neural network models, whileneural network models depicted low RMSE.

Non-destructive Prediction of Nicotine Content in Tobacco Using Hyperspectral Image–Derived Spectra and Machine Learning,2022,"['Chemometrics', 'Partial least squares regression', 'Random forest', 'Support vector regression', 'Variable importance in projection']",,"Purpose Rapid prediction of tobacco nicotine content in tobacco industries has become essential to maintain a stable and reliable cigarette quality. This research deals with combining hyperspectral images (HSI) and chemometric models to predict nicotine content in powdered tobacco samples.Methods Fifty-seven dried powdered tobacco leaf samples were scanned using a hyperspectral camera followed by image processing. The region of interest (ROI) was selected for calculating average spectra. The average spectra and the destructive measurements of nicotine concentration in the samples were used to develop four regression models based on partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and PLSR–variable importance in projection (PLSR– VIP). The models were evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and on 15% test dataset.Results The PLSR outperformed (R2=0.93, RMSE= 0.21%) SVR- and RF-based nicotine prediction models using the entire 970–1700-nm range. Five bands centred at 976.15 nm, 1452 nm, 1575.5 nm, 1592.3 nm, and 1698.9 nm were identified as effective wavelengths for nicotine content prediction and used by the PLSR–variable importance in projection (PLSR–VIP) model to produce satisfactory validation performance (R2=0.91, RMSE= 0.30%). The LOOCV yielded R2 values ranging between 0.89 and 0.93 for the evaluated models.Conclusion The PLSR-VIP model with 96% fewer wavelengths than the full range PLSR highlighted its potential for a more simplistic nicotine prediction mechanism.

Predictive Modeling for Machining Power Based on Multi-source Transfer Learning in Metal Cutting,2022,"['Energy-efficient machining', 'Machining power', 'Predictive analytics', 'Sustainable manufacturing', 'Transfer learning', 'Machine learning']",,"Energy efficiency has become crucial in the metal cutting industry. Machining power has therefore become an important metric because it directly affects the energy consumed during the operation of a machine tool. Attempts to predict machining power using machine learning have relied on the training datasets processed from actual machining data to derive the numerical relationship between process parameters and machining power. However, real fields hardly provide training datasets because of the difficulties in data collection; consequently, traditional learning approaches are ineffective in such data-scarce or -absent environment. This paper proposes a transfer learning approach for the predictive modeling of machining power. The proposed approach creates machining power prediction models by transferring the knowledge acquired from prior machining to the target machining context where machining power data are absent. The proposed approach performs domain adaptation by adding workpiece material properties to the original feature space for accommodating different machining power patterns dependent on the types of workpiece materials. A case study demonstrates that the training datasets obtained from the fabrication of steel and aluminum materials can be successfully used to create the power-predictive models that anticipate machining power for titanium material."

Applying Deep Reinforcement Learning to Improve Throughput and Reduce Collision Rate in IEEE 802.11 Networks,2022,"['Contention window threshold', '(CW<sub>Threshold</ sub>)', 'deep Q-learning network (DQN)', 'deep reinforcement learning (DRL)', 'smart exponential-threshold-linear backoff algorithm with deep Q-learning network (SETL-DQN)', 'wireless networks']",,"The effectiveness of Wi-Fi networks is greatly influenced by the optimization of contention window (CW) parameters. Unfortunately, the conventional approach employed by IEEE 802.11 wireless networks is not scalable enough to sustain consistent performance for the increasing number of stations. Yet, it is still the default when accessing channels for single-users of 802.11 transmissions. Recently, there has been a spike in attempts to enhance network performance using a machine learning (ML) technique known as reinforcement learning (RL). Its advantage is interacting with the surrounding environment and making decisions based on its own experience. Deep RL (DRL) uses deep neural networks (DNN) to deal with more complex environments (such as continuous state spaces or actions spaces) and to get optimum rewards. As a result, we present a new approach of CW control mechanism, which is termed as contention window threshold (CW<sub>Threshold</sub>). It uses the DRL principle to define the threshold value and learn optimal settings under various network scenarios. We demonstrate our proposed method, known as a smart exponential-threshold-linear backoff algorithm with a deep Q-learning network (SETL-DQN). The simulation results show that our proposed SETL-DQN algorithm can effectively improve the throughput and reduce the collision rates."
Identifying Sustainable Development Patterns of Nations and Cities in Three Asian Regions with Unsupervised Learning,2022,"['South Asia', 'Southeast Asia', 'West Asia', 'Time Series Clustering', 'Machine Learning']",,"Asia, the largest and most populous continent in the world, is in dire need of sustainable development due to its rapid urbanization; particularly, the Southeast, South, and West Asia regions demand the most attention. However, previous studies have been limited in examining sustainable development patterns in the three regions. This study identified sustainability development patterns in 23 countries and 33 major cities in three Asian regions using time series clustering, an unsupervised learning technique. Considering the three pillars of sustainability, three clusters were identified at both national and city levels based on three variables: population, GDP per capita, and total energy/electricity consumption per capita. The identified clusters suggested diverse sustainable development patterns in each of the three regions. The largest clusters at national and city levels exhibited a rapid development trend in all three aspects, indicating an urgent need to pursue sustainable development. Other clusters revealed complex trends that were closely linked to local development characteristics. Overall, the clusters at both national and city levels transcend the regions significantly, suggesting that future policymaking in the three regions should be tailored to local issues and take cues from regions with similar patterns rather than adhering to the conventional notion of Asian regions. The results provide fresh insights into sustainable development patterns in the three regions, thereby helping policymakers make better policy comparisons and more targeted policy execution decisions."
Classification of rotary machine fault considering signal differences,2022,"['Delta signal', 'Genetic algorithm', 'Phase synchronization', 'Rotary machine', 'Machine learning']",,"Machine learning for the diagnosis of rotary machines takes priority in generating a training data set through the machine’s past data. The training data set uses features that have physical and statistical meaning of vibration signals. A training data is formed on the assumption that the normal condition of the facility is almost similar over time. However, many industrial power plants perform regular O/H (overhaul), and the vibration level of the machine's normal condition is likely to change depending on the O/H results. The vibration level is one of the important factors representing the condition change of rotating machines and is difficult to ignore easily. This paper is a study on a method that can be used for feature-based machine learning with training data formed from past data whose vibration level of the rotating machine has changed due to the influence of maintenance. Data acquisition was made through labscale defect simulation test devices, and experimental equipment was simulated before and after O/H with several faults that could occur in rotating machines. The signal named “delta signal” refers to a signal that sets each normal data as a reference signal, matches the fault signal through phase synchronization and resampling, and subtracts it to leave only a difference. The algorithms used in machine learning used genetic algorithm (GA) based feature selection and support vector machines (SVM) for learning and classification. According to the experiment, it was confirmed that in raw signal learning, the similarity by the learned condition (label) decreased due to the influence of maintenance, but the method using delta signal decreased the effect by maintenance, increasing the similarity within the same learned condition."
Deep Learning Applications in Perfusion MRI: Recent Advances and Current Challenges,2022,"['Deep learning', 'Machine learning', 'Neural network', 'Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI', 'Dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI', 'Arterial spin labeling']",,"Deep learning has shown its feasibility for applications in medical imaging. Deep learning- based methods are also rapidly being applied in a wide range of areas to replace traditional model-based methods, showing remarkable improvements in several MR image processing areas such as image reconstruction, image contrast conversion, and image quality improvement. With improvement of perfusion MRI techniques, various clinical applications have been also researched, which have improved tracer-kinetic modeling, and vice versa. Representatively, increased vascularity due to tumor angiogenesis, altered permeability due to blood-brain barrier breakdown, and quantifiable absolute cerebral blood perfusion can be imaged via perfusion MRI techniques. As a result, a large number of retrospective and prospective studies have proven that perfusion MRI can be used clinically to investigate various diseases (ranging from brain tumor, stroke, and migraine to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease) and various organs including brain, breast, prostate, and pancreas. However, tracer-kinetic model-based processing of parametric maps requires many physical assumptions, which is time-consuming with limitations in clinical applications. With current rapid development of deep learning technologies, the importance of the role of deep learning in MR imaging research appears to be increasing. Specifically for processing perfusion MRI, deep learning has its merit as an end-to-end model-free approach, resulting in markedly reduced processing time compared to conventional iterative methods thanks to its nearly instantaneous inference despite long training time. In this review, first, basic principles of MR physics in perfusion MRI are described. Recent progress and current challenges in both technical improvement and clinical applications of perfusion MRI using deep learning techniques are then summarized."
Evaluation and Adjustment Based on Broad Learning System for Small Signal Stability Analysis of Power System Integrated with Wind Farms,2022,"['Broad learning system', 'Wind farms', 'Small signal stability analysis', 'Machine learning', 'Damping ratio sensitivity']",,"This paper primarily focuses on evaluation and adjustment methods for small signal analysis with wind farm integration. The connection of wind farms may aff ect the original oscillation modes of the system, and may also introduce new oscillation modes. To ensure the security and stability of the system, it is necessary to assess the running state of the system and evaluate the development direction of the small signal stability on the premise of taking volatility into account.

A Deep Learning-Based Compact Weighted Binary Classification Technique to Discriminate between Targets and Clutter in SAR Images,2022,"['Automatic Target Detection (ATD)', 'Deep Learning (DL)', 'Machine Learning (ML)', 'Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR).']",,"The proposed approach is a deep learning-based compact weighted binary classification (DL-CWBC) method to discriminate between targets and clutter in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. A new modified cross-entropy error function is proposed to improve the probability of detection by controlling the rate of false alarms (FAs). The unique feature of a CWBC algorithm is reducing the FA rate and maximizing the probability of target detection without missing any target. For pre-processing, targets and clutter are detected through a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) as a conventional detection algorithm. These are then manually divided into two classes. The classified targets and clutter were trained through a ResNet-101 network. There is a trade-off between the minimization of the FA rate and the maximization of the detection probability for targets of interest (TOIs). The weighted coefficient of the modified cross-entropy error function tries to maximize the performance of this trade-off. In addition, the proposed approach enables us not to miss any targets by an extreme distinction decision. Above all, the DL-CWBC algorithm performs very well despite its simplicity."

In addition to recordings of swimming behaviour under normal conditions, the swimming patterns of fish under abnormal conditions were recorded on adding an anaesthetic or lowering the salinity. The abnormal conditions led to changes in the velocity of movement (3.8 ± 0.6 cm/s) involving an initial rapid increase in speed (up to 16.5 ± 3.0 cm/s, upon 2-phenoxyethanol treatment) before the fish stopped moving, as well as changing from swimming upright to dying lying on their sides. Machine learning was applied to datasets consisting of normal or abnormal behaviour patterns, to evaluate the fish behaviour. The proposed algorithm showed a high accuracy (98.1%) in discriminating normal and abnormal rock bream behaviour. We conclude that artificial intelligence-based detection of abnormal behaviour can be applied to develop an automatic bio-management system for use in the aquaculture industry."
Classification of impinging jet flames using convolutional neural network with transfer learning,2022,"['Convolutional neural network', 'Image classification', 'Impinging jet flame', 'Thermoacoustic oscillation', 'Transfer learning']",,"Depending on the equivalence ratio and the Reynolds number, impinging jet flames exhibit several modes of thermoacoustic oscillation. In this study, we present a machine-learning-based method for classifying the regimes of thermoacoustic oscillation. We perform transfer learning to train the convolutional neural network model designed to classify flame images. We show that an accurate classification of impinging jet flames is achieved with an accuracy of 93.6 % by using just a single snapshot image.

Detection and Localization of Coordinated State-and-Topology False Data Injection Attack by Multi-modal Learning,2022,"['Power system cyber security', 'False data injection attack', 'Topology attack', 'Multi-modal learning', 'Data-driven methods']",,"False data injection attack (FDIA) is a typical cyber-attack targeting on power system state estimation. By inserting bias into the power system meter measurements, FDIA can cause errors in state estimation and consequently mislead power system operation. Recently, the coordinated state-and-topology FDIA was developed to falsify both the meter measurements and the topology information to conceal a cyber or physical attack. Conventional machine-learning-based detection methods against FDIA depend on the complete observability of power system topology, therefore cannot detect the coordinated state-andtopology FDIA. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-modal learning model based on Graph Auto-Encoder (GAE) and Residual Neural Networks (ResNet) to detect this type of FDIA. First, GAE is used to learn the compact representation of power system topologies. Then, the obtained topological representation is fused with the measurement to obtain the multi-modal features. Third, ResNet is trained as a multi-label classifi er to accept the fused features and generate an array, which can detect attack scenarios and identify the falsifi ed measurements/topologies by coordinated attacks. Comprehensive case studies using IEEE 9-bus, IEEE 57-bus, and IEEE 118-bus systems are presented. The simulation results show that, as compared to single feature methods, the proposed method is more eff ective in detecting coordinated state-and-topology attacks, and more robust in case of FDIA under unseen topological changes in power system operation"

Systematic Review of Predictive Learning Analytics Using Online Learning Engagement Data,2022,"['Online learning', 'Higher education', 'Predictive learning analytics', 'Machine learning', '온라인 학습', '고등교육', '학습예측분석', '기계학습']",,"Learning analytics has been effectively used to predict learning performance in online learning environments. On the basis of prediction results, instructors and administrators have made efforts to improve the quality of higher education. However, there is a concern that learning analytics does not guarantee the improvement of teaching and learning activities without an in-depth understanding of educational theory and practice. This study aims to review previous studies on predictive learning analytics (PLA) using online learning engagement data in higher education so as to explore the future direction of PLA. A total of 94 papers, published from 2011 to 2020, were reviewed in regard to (a) research trends, (b) types of online learning engagement, and (c) educational implications. The research on predictive learning analytics has increased rapidly, using the data collected from online learning environments. Nevertheless, there was lack of research analyzing online learning activities across different domains, which might limit a prediction model’s generalizability. In addition, PLA frequently used behavioral, cognitive, and social engagement data to predict learning performance, but not emotional engagement data. There were also limitations in giving prescriptive implications to educational stakeholders based on PLA results, although many studies focused on the accuracy of prediction. These findings imply that interdisciplinary research is necessary not only to predict learning performance accurately but also to interpret and use PLA results for the improvement of higher education."
A Comparison of Meta-learning and Transfer-learning for Few-shot Jamming Signal Classification,2022,"['jamming', 'meta-learning', 'transfer learning', 'classification']",,"Typical anti-jamming technologies based on array antennas, Space Time Adaptive Process (STAP) & Space Frequency Adaptive Process (SFAP), are very effective algorithms to perform nulling and beamforming. However, it does not perform equally well for all types of jamming signals. If the anti-jamming algorithm is not optimized for each signal type, antijamming performance deteriorates and the operation stability of the system become worse by unnecessary computation. Therefore, jamming classification technique is required to obtain optimal anti-jamming performance. Machine learning, which has recently been in the spotlight, can be considered to classify jamming signal. In general, performing supervised learning for classification requires a huge amount of data and new learning for unfamiliar signal. In the case of jamming signal classification, it is difficult to obtain large amount of data because outdoor jamming signal reception environment is difficult to configure and the signal type of attacker is unknown. Therefore, this paper proposes few-shot jamming signal classification technique using meta-learning and transfer-learning to train the model using a small amount of data. A training dataset is constructed by anti-jamming algorithm input data within the GNSS receiver when jamming signals are applied. For metalearning, Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) algorithm with a general Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) model is used, and the same CNN model is used for transfer-learning. They are trained through episodic training using training datasets on developed our Python-based simulator. The results show both algorithms can be trained with less data and immediately respond to new signal types. Also, the performances of two algorithms are compared to determine which algorithm is more suitable for classifying jamming signals."

Real-Time Lane Detection Based on Deep Learning,2022,"['Deep learning', 'Lane detection', 'Machine vision', 'Multitask learning', 'Perspective loss']",,"As the research and development of autonomous vehicles has become more active, lane detection technologies for providing road information have become key elements. There are limits to detecting lanes in dynamic driving environments in conventional machine vision research, as the approaches are generally dependent on expert scenarios and fi ne-tuned heuristics.Deep learning has shown good performance in classifying target information with this distribution of nonlinear data; thus, many studies have actively applied deep learning to lane detection. However, most of these studies have focused on improving the accuracy, rather than on the operating speed. For the work reported herein, a benchmarking deep-learning framework for lane detection was applied with lightened feature extraction modules and decoder modules. These were used to compare performances and to present an indicator for selecting a model for optimizing real-time performance and accuracy. The VGG-16, MobileNet, and Shuffl eNet networks were used for the encoder module, whereas frontend dilation and UNet were used for the decoder module. The limitations of the benchmarking framework were analyzed, and perspective loss concepts were applied to the processing of the network using front-view images to ensure improvements in the accuracy and operating speed. All of the candidate networks obtained objective performance indicators based on a large-scale benchmark dataset (TuSimple) and network training with a dataset collected and verifi ed via performance on public roads in Singapore"
Stable Federated Learning with Dataset Condensation,2022,"['Deep learning', 'Federated learning', 'Dataset compression', 'Class imbalance']",,"Federated learning (FL) is a new machine learning paradigm, where multiple clients learn their local models to collaboratively integrate into a single global model. Unlike centralized learning, the global model being integrated cannot be tested in FL as the server does not collect any data samples; further, the global model is often sent back and immediately applied to clients even in the middle of training such as Gboard. Therefore, if the performance of the global model is not stable, which is, unfortunately, the case in many FL scenarios with non-IID data, clients can be provided with an inaccurate model. This paper explores the main reason for this training instability of FL, that is, what we call temporary imbalance that happens across rounds, leading to loss of knowledge from previous rounds. To solve this problem, we propose a dataset condensation method to summarize the local data for each client without compromising on privacy. The condensed data are transmitted to the server with the local model and utilized by the server to ensure stable and consistent performance of the global model. Experimental results show that the global model not only achieves training stability but also exhibits a fast convergence speed."

"Identifying Abnormal CFRP Holes Using Both Unsupervised and Supervised Learning Techniques on In-Process Force, Current, and Vibration Signals",2022,"['CFRP drilling', 'Machine learning', 'Unsupervised learning', 'Supervised learning', 'Abnormality detection', 'Hole quality']",,"This study aims to conduct abnormality detection by applying machine learning algorithms when drilling a carbon fiber reinforced plastic laminate. In-process signals including current, thrust force, and vibration were captured during the dry drilling experiments using a 6 mm physical vapor deposit diamond-coated drill at the consistent spindle speed of 6500 RPM and 0.05 mm/rev. Across measurements from out-of-process variables, including hole diameter, roundness, surface roughness, entry/exit delamination, and entry/exit uncut fiber area, in-process measurements were most able to find outliers with respect to diameter. Both Principal Component Analysis, an unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique, and Linear Discriminant Analysis, a supervised dimensionality reduction technique, could separate oversize or undersize holes from average-sized holes when using fast Fourier transformation data of in-process vibration. Predictive performance with k-Nearest Neighbors shows that our machine learning pipeline can predict oversized vs. non-oversized holes with over 85% accuracy in this dataset. Peak prediction performance is obtained when in-process measurement data is viewed from the frequency domain, and predictions are weighted based on the relative distances of the nearest neighbors."

Bioimage Analyses Using Artificial Intelligence and Future Ecological Research and Education Prospects: A Case Study of the Cichlid Fishes from Lake Malawi Using Deep Learning,2022,"['Animal detection', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Citizenscience', 'Deep learning', 'Education', 'Machine learning']",,"Ecological research relies on the interpretation of large amounts of visual data obtained from extensive wildlife surveys, but such large-scale image interpretation is costly and time-consuming. Using an artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning model, especially convolution neural networks (CNN), it is possible to streamline these manual tasks on image information and to protect wildlife and record and predict behavior. Ecological research using deep-learning-based object recognition technology includes various research purposes such as identifying, detecting, and identifying species of wild animals, and identification of the location of poachers in real-time. These advances in the application of AI technology can enable efficient management of endangered wildlife, animal detection in various environments, and real-time analysis of image information collected by unmanned aerial vehicles. Furthermore, the need for school education and social use on biodiversity and environmental issues using AI is raised. School education and citizen science related to ecological activities using AI technology can enhance environmental awareness, and strengthen more knowledge and problem-solving skills in science and research processes. Under these prospects, in this paper, we compare the results of our early 2013 study, which automatically identified African cichlid fish species using photographic data of them, with the results of reanalysis by CNN deep learning method. By using PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning frameworks, we achieve an accuracy of 82.54% and an F1-score of 0.77 with minimal programming and data preprocessing effort.

Online Gaussian Process State-space Model: Learning and Planning for Partially Observable Dynamical Systems,2022,"['Gaussian processes', 'Gaussian process state-space model', 'machine learning', 'reinforcement learning', 'system identification.']",,"This paper proposes an online learning method of Gaussian process state-space model (GP-SSM). GPSSM is a probabilistic representation learning scheme that represents unknown state transition and/or measurement models as Gaussian processes (GPs). While the majority of prior literature on learning of GP-SSM are focused on processing a given set of time series data, data may arrive and accumulate sequentially over time in most dynamical systems. Storing all such sequential data and updating the model over entire data incur large amount of computational resources in space and time. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a practical method, termed onlineGPSSM, that incorporates stochastic variational inference (VI) and online VI with novel formulation. The proposed method mitigates the computational complexity without catastrophic forgetting and also support adaptation to changes in a system and/or real environments. Furthermore, we present application of onlineGPSSM into the reinforcement learning (RL) of partially observable dynamical systems by integrating onlineGPSSM with Bayesian filtering and trajectory optimization algorithms. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate applicability of the proposed method."

Exploring the Use of Machine Translations for International Students in Korea,2022,"['Machine Translation', 'Translation Method', 'Automated Translation Machine']",,"Since its first introduction in 2006, the use of Machine Translation (MT) has now been expanded to all fields of life. Such web-based translation services have now employed neural machine translation to learn from mistakes and learn the type of translations the users require.

Recently, different strategies employed for using the MTs have been explored, yet studies have mainly concentrated on Korean-to-English and vice versa. With the increasing number of international students coming to Korea, it was necessary to find out how international students employed MTs. Frequency data and analytical findings revealed that most of the students used Naver Papago and those who frequently employed this device not only limited themselves for tests or writing assignments but also in daily routines. Although the survey won’t provide the best strategy, this could be a starting point for providing guidelines and with further studies, this could provide effective suggestions for fully utilizing the MT services."
Meta-Learning Approaches for mmWave Path Loss Modeling in Smart Factories,2022,['Millimeter waveSmart factoryPath loss modelingMeta-learningDeep learning'],,"With the growing interest in both public and private 5G services based on millimeter wave (mmWave) communication for indoor usage scenarios such as smart factories, site design specialists are seeking sophisticated methods and tools for simulating indoor radio coverage based on highly accurate path loss prediction models. Although machine learning approaches can be used in path loss modeling thanks to the highly accurate prediction capability, their performance can be limited by the size of available measurement data set used for training. In this paper, we propose new approaches to train path loss models in the few-shot learning scenarios of smart factories. The proposed approaches are based on meta-learning with slight modifications to perform fine-tuning over an entire train data set rather than a meta-test data set. It is shown that the indoor path loss models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by meta-learning based on three different meta-train task assignment schemes outperform both a conventional CNN model and an empirical model."

Performance of Support Vector Machine for Classifying Land Cover in Optical Satellite Images: A Case Study in Delaware River Port Area,2022,"['Support vector machine (SVM)', 'High-resolution image', 'KOMPSAT', 'Land cover classification']",,"The availability of high-resolution satellite images provides precise information without direct observation of the research target. Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite (KOMPSAT), also known as the Arirang satellite, has been developed and utilized for earth observation. The machine learning model was continuously proven as a good classifier in classifying remotely sensed images. This study aimed to compare the performance of the support vector machine (SVM) model in classifying the land cover of the Delaware River port area on high and medium-resolution images. Three optical images, which are KOMPSAT-2, KOMPSAT-3A, and Sentinel-2B, were classified into six land cover classes, including water, road, vegetation, building, vacant, and shadow. The KOMPSAT images are provided by Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI), and the Sentinel-2B image was provided by the European Space Agency (ESA). The training samples were manually digitized for each land cover class and considered the reference image. The predicted images were compared to the actual data to obtain the accuracy assessment using a confusion matrix analysis. In addition, the time-consuming training and classifying were recorded to evaluate the model performance. The results showed that the KOMPSAT-3A image has the highest overall accuracy and followed by KOMPSAT-2 and Sentinel-2B results. On the contrary, the model took a long time to classify the higher-resolution image compared to the lower resolution. For that reason, we can conclude that the SVM model performed better in the higher resolution image with the consequence of the longer time-consuming training and classifying data. Thus, this finding might provide consideration for related researchers when selecting satellite imagery for effective and accurate image classification."

It can be an alternative tool for conventional stone analysis and provide decision support to urologists, improving the effectiveness of diagnosis and treatment."
An Advanced Operation Mode with Product-Service System Using Lifecycle Big Data and Deep Learning,2022,"['Product-service system', 'Sharing', 'Production machine', 'Lifecycle', 'Big data', 'Fault diagnosis']",,"As a successful business strategy for enhancing environmental sustainability and decreasing the natural resource consumption of societies, the product-service system (PSS) has raised significant interests in the academic and industrial community. However, with the digitisation of the industry and the advancement of multisensory technologies, the PSS providers face many challenges. One major challenge is how the PSS providers can fully capture and efficiently analyse the operation and maintenance big data of different products and different customers in different conditions to obtain insights to improve their production processes, products and services. To address this challenge, a new operation mode and procedural approach are proposed for operation and maintenance of bigger cluster products, when these products are provided as a part of PSS and under exclusive control by the providers. The proposed mode and approach are driven by lifecycle big data of large cluster products and employs deep learning to train the neural networks to identify the fault features, thereby monitoring the products’ health status. This new mode is applied to a real case of a leading CNC machine provider to illustrate its feasibility. Higher accuracy and shortened time for fault prediction are realised, resulting in the provider’s saving of the maintenance and operation cost."

In particular, in the national defense field, attention is paid to intelligent recognition among machine learning techniques, and efforts are being made to develop object identification and monitoring systems using artificial intelligence. To this end, various image processing technologies and object identification algorithms are applied to create a model that can identify friendly and enemy weapon systems and personnel in real-time. In this paper, we conducted image processing and object identification focused on tanks among various weapon systems. We initially conducted processing the tanks' image using a convolutional neural network, a deep learning technique. The feature map was examined and the important characteristics of the tanks crucial for learning were derived. Then, using YOLOv5 Network, a CNN-based object detection network, a model trained by labeling the entire tank and a model trained by labeling only the turret of the tank were created and the results were compared.

Quantification of Efflorescences in Pustular Psoriasis Using Deep Learning,2022,"['Psoriasis', 'Dermatology', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning']",,"Objectives: Pustular psoriasis (PP) is one of the most severe and chronic skin conditions. Its treatment is difficult, and measurementsof its severity are highly dependent on clinicians’ experience. Pustules and brown spots are the main efflorescencesof the disease and directly correlate with its activity. We propose an automated deep learning model (DLM) to quantifylesions in terms of count and surface percentage from patient photographs. Methods: In this retrospective study, two dermatologistsand a student labeled 151 photographs of PP patients for pustules and brown spots. The DLM was trained andvalidated with 121 photographs, keeping 30 photographs as a test set to assess the DLM performance on unseen data. We alsoevaluated our DLM on 213 unstandardized, out-of-distribution photographs of various pustular disorders (referred to as thepustular set), which were ranked from 0 (no disease) to 4 (very severe) by one dermatologist for disease severity. The agreementbetween the DLM predictions and experts’ labels was evaluated with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for thetest set and Spearman correlation (SC) coefficient for the pustular set. Results: On the test set, the DLM achieved an ICC of0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97–0.98) for count and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.92–0.94) for surface percentage. On the pustularset, the DLM reached a SC coefficient of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.60–0.74) for count and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.75–0.83) for surface percentage.Conclusions: The proposed method quantifies efflorescences from PP photographs reliably and automatically, enabling aprecise and objective evaluation of disease activity."
Sentinel-2 Cloud Mask Classification Using Deep Learning Method,2022,"['Convolutional neural network', 'Cloud Mask', 'Sentinel-2', 'KappaMask', 'Active learning', 'Image segmentation', 'Remote Sensing']",,"The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission operated by the European Space Agency (ESA) provides comprehensive and continuous multi-spectral observations of all Earth’s land surface since mid-2015. Clouds and cloud shadows significantly decrease the usability of optical satellite data especially in agricultural applications; therefore, an accurate and reliable cloud mask is mandatory for effective Earth Observation (EO) optical data exploitation. During the last years, image segmentation techniques have developed rapidly with the exploitation of neural networks capabilities. In this perspective, the KappaMask processor using U-Net architecture was developed with the ability to generate a classification mask over northern latitudes into the following classes: clear, cloud shadow, semi-transparent cloud (thin clouds), and cloud, invalid. For training, a Sentinel-2 dataset covering Northern European terrestrial area was labeled. KappaMask provides a 10 m classification mask for Sentinel-2 Level- 2A (L2A) and Level-1C (L1C) products. The total dice coefficient on the test dataset, which was not seen by the model at any stage, was 80% for KappaMask L2A and 76% for KappaMask L1C for 27 clear, cloud shadow, semi-transparent, cloud classes. Comparison with rule-based cloud mask 28 methods was then performed on the same test dataset, where Sen2Cor reached 59% dice coefficient 29 for clear, cloud shadow, semi-transparent, cloud classes, Fmask 61% for clear, cloud shadow, cloud 30 classes, and Maja 51% for clear and cloud classes. The closest machine learning open-source cloud classification mask, S2cloudless, has 63% dice coefficient providing only cloud and clear classes, while KappaMask L2A with a more complex classification schema outperformed S2cloudless by 17%."
Detecting Fake News about COVID-19 Infodemic Using Deep Learning and Content Analysis,2022,"['COVID-19', 'Infodemic', 'Fake News Detection', 'Machine Learning', 'Topic Modeling', 'Linguistic Analysis']",,"With the widespread use of social media, online social platforms like Twitter have become a place of rapid dissemination of information―both accurate and inaccurate. After the COVID-19 outbreak, the overabundance of fake information and rumours on online social platforms about the COVID-19 pandemic has spread over society as quickly as the virus itself. As a result, fake news poses a significant threat to effective virus response by negatively affecting people’s willingness to follow the proper public health guidelines and protocols, which makes it important to identify fake information from online platforms for the public interest. In this research, we introduce an approach to detect fake news using deep learning techniques, which outperform traditional machine learning techniques with a 93.1% accuracy. We then investigate the content differences between real and fake news by applying topic modeling and linguistic analysis. Our results show that topics on Politics and Government services are most common in fake news. In addition, we found that fake news has lower analytic and authenticity scores than real news. With the findings, we discuss important academic and practical implications of the study."
Study of Convolution Neural Network Based Deep Learning to Classify the Quality  of Self-Piercing Riveting Joint,2022,"['Convolution  Neural  Network(CNN)', 'Classification', 'Self-Piercing  Rivet(SPR)', 'Deep  learning', 'Abnormal process  conditions']",,"The SPR(Self-Piercing Riveting) process is a mechanical joining process that is mainly applied to assembling multi- material parts to reduce the weight of the car body. Because the quality of SPR joints is mainly evaluated through cross sectional inspection, which is a type of destructive inspection, it is expensive and time-consuming. Machine learning technology is being proposed as a non-destructive testing because it can predict the quality based on the signals generated during the process. However, research result on the quality prediction modeling of SPR joints have not yet been reported. In this study, the prediction accuracy according to the signal combination was compared and evaluated by applying the CNN algorithm using the displacement and load signals generated during the SPR process and the acoustic signal obtained from the acoustic sensor. The materials used in the experiment were SGAFC 1180Y, CFRP, and SPFC 590 and the thickness were 1.4 mm, 1.8 mm, and 1.0 m respectively and a three-layer SPR process was performed. After evaluating joining was performed by selecting the abnormal process conditions, with 12 con- ditions that may occur during the process. Consequently, in the case of the first model in which the CNN algorithm was based on displacement and load signals, the quality prediction accuracy was estimated to be 90.0%. In the case of the second model in which the CNN algorithm added acoustic signals to the displacement and load signals, the quality prediction accuracy was estimated to be 77.5%."
Modeling and Multi-objective Optimization Method of Machine Tool Energy Consumption Considering Tool Wear,2022,"['Energy consumption modelling', 'Tool wear', 'Parameter optimization', 'Improved TLBO algorithm', 'Surface roughness']",,"The natural energy crisis and the increasingly serious environmental problems have imposed all industries to reduce energy consumption. During milling process, selecting a correct cutting parameters can not only greatly improve production quality and processing efficiency, but also can reduce energy consumption, in addition, tool wear also has a great impact on them. Therefore, a milling power consumption model of CNC machine tools is established based on modern machining theory is established in this article, unlike traditional energy consumption models, our model takes full account of cutting conditions and tool wear. The surface roughness of parts is one of the important indicators to measure the machining quality of machine tools. Therefore, taking milling process as research object, a multi-objective cutting parameters optimization model that takes the machining surface roughness, material removal rate (MRR) and machining energy consumption as the optimization goals was established. Furthermore, an intelligent optimization algorithm was proposed based on improved Teaching–Learning- Based Optimization (TLBO) to solve the model under various limited milling conditions. Finally, comparing experimental results of optimized parameter and empirical parameters, it shows that goals of reducing energy consumption, improving productivity and machining quality can be achieved by optimizing cutting parameters."
Improvement of Dynamic Window Approach Using Reinforcement Learning in Dynamic Environments,2022,"['Dynamic window approach (DWA)', 'mobile robot', 'obstacle avoidance', 'reinforcement learning.']",,"In environments where dynamic or unknown obstacles exist, a robot needs to use collision avoidance algorithms to protect itself and provide personal safety. Recently, many researchers have used machine learning techniques to study obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments. However, these studies are insufficient for providing a velocity model for actual driving because of the limited number of motions and parameters tuning according to environmental changes. This paper proposes an algorithm that combines the dynamic window approach (DWA) and deep reinforcement learning to build a velocity model to avoid obstacles. This method adds and subtracts the linear and angular velocities of the robot from the DWA calculations using the designed learning module. Through this configuration, many robotic motions can be generated even with limited action functions. In our experiments, the application of this learning module showed a 23.7% higher rate of obstacle avoidance than with DWA alone. The experimental results verified that the proposed method improved the performance of obstacle avoidance for multiple dynamic environments without any additional work. It has been confirmed that this method can be applied to real robots as well."

Roads are in a state of waiting in line or even congestion, which seriously affects people's enthusiasm and efficiency of travel. This paper mainly studies the discrete domain path planning method based on the flow data. Taking the traffic flow data based on the highway network structure as the research object, this paper uses the deep learning theory technology to complete the path weight determination process, optimizes the path planning algorithm, realizes the vehicle path planning application for the expressway, and carries on the deployment operation in the highway company. The path topology is constructed to transform the actual road information into abstract space that the machine can understand. An appropriate data structure is used for storage, and a path topology based on the modeling background of expressway is constructed to realize the mutual mapping between the two. Experiments show that the proposed method can further reduce the interpolation error, and the interpolation error in the case of random missing is smaller than that in the other two missing modes. In order to improve the real-time performance of vehicle path planning, the association features are selected, the path weights are calculated comprehensively, and the traditional path planning algorithm structure is optimized. It is of great significance for the sustainable development of cities."
Identifying Sustainable Development Patterns of Nations and Cities in Three Asian Regions with Unsupervised Learning,2022,"['South Asia', 'Southeast Asia', 'West Asia', 'Time Series Clustering', 'Machine Learning']",,"Asia, the largest and most populous continent in the world, is in dire need of sustainable development due to its rapid urbanization; particularly, the Southeast, South, and West Asia regions demand the most attention. However, previous studies have been limited in examining sustainable development patterns in the three regions. This study identified sustainability development patterns in 23 countries and 33 major cities in three Asian regions using time series clustering, an unsupervised learning technique. Considering the three pillars of sustainability, three clusters were identified at both national and city levels based on three variables: population, GDP per capita, and total energy/electricity consumption per capita. The identified clusters suggested diverse sustainable development patterns in each of the three regions. The largest clusters at national and city levels exhibited a rapid development trend in all three aspects, indicating an urgent need to pursue sustainable development. Other clusters revealed complex trends that were closely linked to local development characteristics. Overall, the clusters at both national and city levels transcend the regions significantly, suggesting that future policymaking in the three regions should be tailored to local issues and take cues from regions with similar patterns rather than adhering to the conventional notion of Asian regions. The results provide fresh insights into sustainable development patterns in the three regions, thereby helping policymakers make better policy comparisons and more targeted policy execution decisions."

The SWH model showing the relationships between critical thinking domains and academic achievement at grade 5 was developed, and its validity was tested across different learning environments. We also evaluated the stability of the model by applying the SWH models to the data of the grade levels. The findings can help mathematics educators understand how critical thinking and achievement relate to each other.

Using logistic regression to predict accounting fraud is subject to a class imbalance problem because of the small accounting fraud sample in the analysis. To overcome this problem, we utilize the RUSBoost approach based on ensemble learning. Unlike the logistic regression model, the RUSBoost approach is known as an approach to adjust the sample based on the distribution of minority groups and is less likely to subject to the class imbalance problem. By comparing the predictive ability of logistic regression and the RUSBoost approach on future accounting fraud, we find that the RUSBoost approach based on ensemble learning improves the accuracy of future accounting fraud prediction. Additionally, we find that improvement in the accuracy of the model is more pronounced for the accounting fraud with intention and the fraud with numbers in the financial statements. Lastly, we suggest some accounting variables that are closely related to future accounting fraud. In sum, we provide the first large-sample evidence of how the newly established machine learning approach improves the accuracy of fraud prediction, thereby being suggestive of the feasibility of machine learning approach research in the accounting area."

The inverse perspective transformation method is presented for obtaining a bird’s-eye view of the scene from a perspective image to remove perspective effects. This method requires only the internal and external parameters of the camera without a homography matrix with 8 degrees of freedom (DoF) that maps the points in one image to the corresponding points in the other image. To improve the accuracy and speed of lane detection in complex road environments, machine learning algorithm that has passed the first classifier is used. Before using machine learning, we apply a meaningful first classifier to the lane detection to improve the detection speed. The first classifier is applied in the bird’s-eye view image to determine lane regions. A lane region passed the first classifier is detected more accurately through machine learning. The system has been tested through the driving video of the vehicle in embedded system. The experimental results show that the proposed method works well in various road environments and meet the real-time requirements. As a result, its lane detection speed is about 3.85 times faster than edge-based lane detection, and its detection accuracy is better than edge-based lane detection."

When the web shell is uploaded to the web server, it is confirmed that the attack frequency is high because the control of the web server can be easily performed. As the damage caused by the web shell occurs a lot, each company is responding to attacks with various security devices such as intrusion prevention systems, firewalls, and web firewalls.

This provided basic data for preparing a traffic safety system for elderly drivers and establishing policies.METHODS : Based on machine learning, the major factors influencing accident severity (from the analysis of traffic accident data for elderly drivers) were analyzed and compared with existing statistical analysis results. The machine learning algorithm used the Scikit-learn library and Python 3.8. A hyperparameter optimization process was performed to improve the safety and accuracy of the model. To establish the optimal state of the model, the hyperparameters were set (K = 5) using K-fold cross-validation. The hyperparameter search applied the most widely utilized grid search method, and the performance evaluation derived the optimal hyperparameter value using neutral squared error indicators.RESULTS : The traffic laws, road sections of traffic accidents, and time zones of accidents were analyzed for accidents involving elderly drivers in Daejeon Metropolitan City, and the importance of the variables was examined. For the analysis, a linear regression model, machine learning-based decision tree, and random forest model were used, and based on the root mean square error, the random forest accuracy performance was found to be the best. Ultimately, 18 variables were analyzed, including traffic violations, accident time zones, and road types. The variables influencing the accident severity were the speed, signal violation, intersection section, late-night driving, and pedestrian protection violation, with the relative importance of the variables in the order of speed (0.3490966), signal violation (0.285967), and late-night driving (0.173108). These can be seen as variables related to the expansion of life damage owing to physical aging and reduced judgment abilities arising from decreases in cognitive function.CONCLUSIONS : Restricting the driving of the elderly on the expressway and at night is reasonable, but specific standards for driving restrictions should be prepared based on individual driving capabilities."

As the spatial scope is narrowed down, there are cases where there are few or no transactions depending on the unit period, which lead index calculation difficult or even impossible. This study suggests a supervised learning-based machine learning model to compensate for missing values that may occur due to no transaction in a specific range and period.

Automated machine learning(auto ML) is an emerging field of machine learning study. Auto ML is used to develop machine learning models while minimizing the time and labor required in the model development process. This study developed an auto ML to predict Chl-a using auto sklearn, one of most widely used open source auto ML algorithms. The model performance was compared with other two popular ensemble machine learning models, random forest(RF) and XGBoost(XGB).

However, while e-learning has many advantages, it has disadvantages as well. One of the main disadvantages of e-learning is that it is difficult for teachers to continuously and systematically monitor learners. Although services such as personalized e-learning are provided to compensate for the shortcoming, systematic monitoring of learners' concentration is insufficient. This study suggests a method to evaluate the learner's concentration by applying machine learning techniques. In this study, emotion and gaze data were extracted from 184 videos of 92 participants. First, the learners' concentration was labeled by experts. Then, statistical-based status indicators were preprocessed from the data.

Hence, there are not a few cases that, for some usual tunnel design works, it is sufficient to perform the design by only modifying or supplementing previous similar design cases unless a tunnel has a unique structure or in geological conditions. In particular, for a tunnelblast design, it is reasonable to refer to previous similar design cases because the blast design in the stage of design is a preliminary design, considering that it is general to perform additional blast design through test blasts prior to the start of tunnel excavation. Meanwhile, entering the industry 4.0 era, artificial intelligence (AI) of which availability is surging across whole industry sector is broadly utilized to tunnel and blasting.For a drill and blast tunnel, AI is mainly applied for the estimation of blast vibration and rock mass classification, etc. however, there are few cases where it is applied to blast pattern design. Thus, this study attempts to automate tunnel blast design by means of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence. For this, the data related to a blast design was collected from 25 tunnel design reports for learning as well as 2 additionalreports for the test, and from which 4 design parameters, i.e., rock mass class, road type and cross sectional area of upper section as well as bench section as input data as well as16 design elements, i.e., blast cut type, specific charge, the number of drill holes, and spacing and burden for each blast hole group, etc. as output. Based on this design data, three machine learning models, i.e., XGBoost, ANN, SVM, were tested and XGBoost was chosen as the best model and the results show a generally similar trend to an actual design when assumed design parameters were input. It is not enough yet to perform the whole blast design using the results from this study, however, it is planned that additional studies will be carried out to make it possible to put it to practical use after collecting more sufficient blast design data and supplementing detailed machine learning processes."

Based on an AFOW database consisting of DFT quantum calculation values, the mechanical properties of materials were predicted using various machine learning models. For supervised learning, the entire data was divided into training data and test data at a ratio of 8:2. Since the discovery of superhard materials can be predicted based on the bulk modulus and shear modulus, the bulk modulus was primarily predicted using only the chemical compositional ratio (chemical formula), and then the shear modulus was obtained using the predicted bulk moduli. To obtain good prediction performance, crossvalidation and hyper-parameter tuning were carried out. Each characteristic was predicted using XGBoost, one of the ensemble algorithms, and its performance was compared to the tree-based machine learning of RandomForest and Support Vector Machine regression using the coefficient of determination (R2) and rootmean- square-error (RMSE) as metrics. For the recently introduced four superhard materials (Mo0.9W1.1BC, ReWC0.8, MoWC2, and ReWB), the results of this study were similar to those of previous studies including the experimental values o r the DFT quantum calculations.

The machine learning model is trained using a dataset that includes the antenna geometry and cost, evaluated on how well the antenna performance satisfies the target bandwidth and radiation pattern. After verifying that the machine learning model is trained using the figure of merit, the machine learning model is validated by comparing the cost estimated by the model with that estimated by a commercial electro- magnetic simulator. Next, we obtain the optimal antenna design from the result of a grid search and fabricate it to verify its performance.The results show that the manufactured antenna has a matching bandwidth from 983.5 to 1,037.5 MHz and a radiation gain of approximately 4 dBi in the target direction.

The signal processing results using the spectrogram of the original signal were shown, and external data were used to overcome the problem that disturbance reactions easily occurred due to the imbalance between the number of normal and abnormal data. Out of distribution (OOD), which uses external data, is a technology that is regarded as abnormal data that is unlikely to occur in reality, but we were able to use it by expanding it. By rearranging the distribution of data in this way, classification can be performed more robustly. Specifically, by observing the trends of the abnormal score and the change in the feature of the representation layer, continuous learning was performed through a mixture of existing and new data."

Meanwhile, for colors with frequency from top 5 to 10, yellow green was expressed darkly, and navy blue was expressed brightly, partially composing a complex harmony. When examining the color band, various colors, brightness, and chroma including light blue, achromatic colors, and warm colors were shown, failing to compose a generally harmonious arrangement of colors.For the frequency of nighttime photos, colors in approximately the upper 50% are dark colors with a brightness value of 2 (Munsell signal). In comparison, the brightness of middle frequency (50-80%) is relatively higher (brightness values of 3-4), and the brightness difference of various colors was large in the lower 20%. Colors that are not cool colors could be found intermittently in the lower 8% of frequency. When examining the color band, there was a general harmonious arrangement of colors centered on navy blue.As the results of conducting the experiment using two methods in this study, machine learning could classify colors into two or more classes, and could evaluate how close an image was with certain colors to a certain class. This method cannot be used if an image cannot be classified into a certain class.The result of such color distribution would serve as a reference when determining how close a certain color is to one of the two classes when the color is used as a dominant color in the base or background color of a certain design. Also, when dividing the analyzed images into several classes, even colors that have not beenused in the analyzed image can be determined to find out how close they are to a certain class according to the color distribution properties of each class. Nevertheless, the results cannot be used to find out whether a specific color was used in the class and by how much it was used.To investigate such an issue, frequency analysis was conducted using KSCA. The color frequency could be measured within the range of images used in the experiment.The resulting valu..."

Essential training data were collected from the reference elements, which were intentionally designated elements among finite element models, during preliminary FE analysis. Additionally, triaxiality values for each finite element were obtained for judging the dominant external loading type, such as tensile, compressive or shear. Training and evaluating machine learning model were conducted using the training data and loading types of elements were predicted in case the level accuracy was fulfilled. Three types of stacking sequences, which were to be known as robust toward specific loading types, were mosaically assigned to the PIC robot arm.

머신러닝 기반 MMS Point Cloud 의미론적 분할,2022,"['Machine learning', 'Mobile mapping system', 'Point cloud', 'Semantic segmentation', 'High definition map']",,"The most important factor in designing autonomous driving systems is to recognize the exact location of the vehicle within the surrounding environment. To date, various sensors and navigation systems have been used for autonomous driving systems; however, all have limitations. Therefore, the need for high-definition (HD) maps that provide high-precision infrastructure information for safe and convenient autonomous driving is increasing. HD maps are drawn using three-dimensional point cloud data acquired through a mobile mapping system (MMS). However, this process requires manual work due to the large numbers of points and drawing layers, increasing the cost and effort associated with HD mapping. The objective of this study was to improve the efficiency of HD mapping by segmenting semantic information in an MMS point cloud into six classes: roads, curbs, sidewalks, medians, lanes, and other elements. Segmentation was performed using various machine learning techniques including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and gradient-boosting machine (GBM), and 11 variables including geometry, color, intensity, and other road design features. MMS point cloud data for a 130-m section of a five-lane road near Minam Station in Busan, were used to evaluate the segmentation models; the average F1 scores of the models were 95.43% for RF, 92.1% for SVM, 91.05% for GBM, and 82.63% for KNN. The RF model showed the best segmentation performance, with F1 scores of 99.3%, 95.5%, 94.5%, 93.5%, and 90.1% for roads, sidewalks, curbs, medians, and lanes, respectively. The variable importance results of the RF model showed high mean decrease accuracy and mean decrease gini for XY dist. and Z dist. variables related to road design, respectively. Thus, variables related to road design contributed significantly to the segmentation of semantic information. The results of this study demonstrate the applicability of segmentation of MMS point cloud data based on machine learning, and will help to reduce the cost and effort associated with HD mapping."
머신러닝 알고리즘 기반 반도체 자동화를 위한 이송로봇 고장진단에 대한 연구,2022,"['Data Analysis', 'PHM', 'Machine Learning', 'Transfer Robot', 'KNN']",,"In manufacturing and semiconductor industries, transfer robots increase productivity through accurate and continuous work. Due to the nature of the semiconductor process, there are environments where humans cannot intervene to maintain internal temperature and humidity in a clean room. So, transport robots take responsibility over humans. In such an environment where the manpower of the process is cutting down, the lack of maintenance and management technology of the machine may adversely affect the production, and that’s why it is necessary to develop a technology for the machine failure diagnosis system. Therefore, this paper tries to identify various causes of failure of transport robots that are widely used in semiconductor automation, and the Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) method is considered for determining and predicting the process of failures. The robot mainly fails in the driving unit due to long-term repetitive motion, and the core components of the driving unit are motors and gear reducer. A simulation drive unit was manufactured and tested around this component and then applied to 6-axis vertical multi-joint robots used in actual industrial sites. Vibration data was collected for each cause of failure of the robot, and then the collected data was processed through signal processing and frequency analysis. The processed data can determine the fault of the robot by utilizing machine learning algorithms such as SVM (Support Vector Machine) and KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor). As a result, the PHM environment was built based on machine learning algorithms using SVM and KNN, confirming that failure prediction was partially possible."

This study investigated the possibility of a real-time leak detection method using the acoustic emission (AE) signal generated from the piping system during the internal leakage of a butterfly valve. Datasets of raw time-domain AE signals were collected and postprocessed for each operation mode of the valve in a systematic manner to develop a data-driven model for the detection and classification of internal leakage, by applying machine learning algorithms. The aim of this study was to determine whether it is possible to treat leak detection as a classification problem by applying two classification algorithms: support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN). The results showed different performances for the algorithms and datasets used. The SVM-based binary classification models, based on feature extraction of data, achieved an overall accuracy of 83% to 90%, while in the case of a multiple classification model, the accuracy was reduced to 66%. By contrast, the CNN-based classification model achieved an accuracy of 99.85%, which is superior to those of any other models based on the SVM algorithm. The results revealed that the SVM classification model requires effective feature extraction of the AE signals to improve the accuracy of multi-class classification. Moreover, the CNN-based classification can be a promising approach to detect both leakage and valve opening as long as the performance of the processor does not degrade."

Therefore, this study aimed to identify the latent groups based on various delinquencies and examine latent groups’ predictors using machine learning and multidimensional approaches.Methods: Using nationally representative data (N = 8,210; male 52.17%), a latent class analysis was conducted to identify latent groups based on 10 delinquent behaviors self-reported by adolescents. A random forest analysis was then employed to predict latent groups using 53 predictors including demographic (6 items), personal (44 items), and environmental levels (3 items). The Mplus program was used for latent class analysis, and the R version 4.0.5 program was used for random forest analysis.Results: Three latent groups were identified and categorized as “high online delinquency” (3.2%), “drink/media delinquency” (26.8%), and “low delinquency” (70.0%). Random forest analysis found adolescents’ perception of harmful substances was the most important variable predicting the delinquent groups. Partial dependence plots showed the higher the interest in harmful substances, the lower the ability to respond to the harmful substances; the higher the access to harmful environment, the lower the grade; and the lower the autonomy control ability, the more likely the classification as a high delinquency group.Conclusion: This study classified three latent groups while considering the detailed types of delinquencies. The study found the prominent predictors using machine learning and multidimensional approaches to suggest useful delinquency prevention programs."

In the process of developing artificial intelligence, various normative ethical theories are loaded into AI. In this process, we first graft the non-consequentialism and consequential normative ethics theories among act-centered normative theories to AI. The reason that act-centered normative theories is loaded first is because it is easy to mount this theory on artificial intelligence because it presents a simple structural standard of motive and result of acts as a criterion for evaluating the value of acts. However, in order for AI to perfectly fulfill its role as an artificial moral agent, it must be equipped with the character-centered normative theories as well as the act-centered normative theories. This is because the diversity of evaluation criteria created by the loading of various ethical theories implies the possibility of choosing more right and good acts. The question is, can AI carry out the process of education and habituation, which can be said to be a characteristic of virtue ethics? This paper will present the application of machine learning and deep learning as a way to solve this problem. As a result, I will show that machine learning and deep learning can solve the difficulties of embedding virtue ethics, and explain the possibility of embedding virtue ethics in artificial moral agents."

PM10·PM2.5 concentrations and other environmental factors were all measured by the national measuring station in units of one hour in 2019. Through the prediction accuracy analysis by machine learning algorithm using these data, it was confirmed that the boosted decision tree had the highest accuracy in PM analysis, and the accuracy was lowered in PM10 and coastal areas due to factors that were not reflected in the feature such as sea salt. After that, by using variable weights derived from linear regression, we found the main causes of the PM concentration increase were PM precursor and the seasonal characteristics of winter and spring. And main causes of PM concentration decrease were dew point temperature, wind speed and direction. Also, the PM increase or decrease due to environmental variables was larger in the inland area than in the coastal area."

This is because quality evaluation agencies in each country are continually strengthening new safety standards for vehicles. Among these various requirements, collision safety must be satisfied by controlling airbags, seat belts, etc., and can be defined as post-crash safety. Apart from this safety system, the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) use advanced detection sensors, GPS, communication, and video equipment to detect the hazard and notify driver before the collision. However, research to improve passenger safety in case of an accident by using the sensor of active safety represented by ADAS in the existing passive safety is limited to the level that utilizes the sudden braking level of the FCA (Forward Collision-avoidance Assist) system. Therefore, this study aims to develop logic that can improve passenger protection in case of an accident by using ADAS information and driving information secured before a collision. The proposed logic was constructed based on LSTM deep learning techniques and trained using crash test data."

Previous studies have phonetically analyzed the voices of patients with CKD, but no studies have been conducted to classify the voices of patients. In this paper, the utterances of patients with CKD were classified using the variety of utterance types (sustained vowel, sentence, general sentence), the feature sets [handcrafted features, extended Geneva Minimalistic Acoustic Parameter Set (eGeMAPS), CNN extracted features], and the classifiers (SVM, XGBoost). Total of 1,523 utterances which are 3 hours, 26 minutes, and 25 seconds long, are used. F1-score of 0.93 for automatically diagnosing a disease, 0.89 for a 3-classes problem, and 0.84 for a 5-classes problem were achieved. The highest performance was obtained when the combination of general sentence utterances, handcrafted feature set, and XGBoost was used. The result suggests that a general sentence utterance that can reflect all speakers’ speech characteristics and an appropriate feature set extracted from there are adequate for the automatic classification of CKD patients’ utterances."

However, research on the penetration depth of the protective material against the small caliber threat is still insufficient. In order to develop a predictive model, this study conducted 119 times of real fire ballistic experiments, meas- ured the penetration depth of each target, and the relationship between threat and the penetration depth was analyzed. For this, 5.56mm K100 and 5.45mm 7N10 bullets were defined as threats, and ballistic experi- ments were performed in four different cases by setting uniformly rolled steel and aluminum plates as targets. For an accurate prediction, five machine learning regression models were applied, and the difference between the actual measured value and the predicted value was quantitatively assessed by applying the three criteria of R^2, RMSE, and MAPE. As a result, the performance of XGBoost model were recorded as 0.999, 0.025, and 0.229, showing high suitability for penetration depth research on the small caliber ammunitions."

As a practical example, ‘Empticon Ⅱ’ of the ‘Roblog’ project identifies the location of the coffee bean sack to be transported. The 3D camera is used for photographing the sack and analyzing it through the computer vision technology. Tremendous amounts of data training efforts were required in advance to make the object detection function better. This method, however, has a disadvantage in that it is difficult to learn and utilize all the objects of various sizes and textures in advance because the object detection performance is proportional to the amount of objects learned in advance. Most of the objects handled are boxes. To prevent damage from using the unloading robot, logistics safety labels are attached to the box. This study aims to make a model that can control automatic loading and unloading robots by recognizing and classifying logistics safety labels attached to boxes of various sizes. To train the machine learning model, the most common logistics safety labels attached to the box or printed need to be obtained as training examples. Unfortunately, there was no such dataset being distributed as an open source, so the authors built a dataset by themselves. A classifier using the ensemble model was created. In order to increase the efficiency of the classifier, the characteristics of the logistics safety labels were extracted through a convolutional network and used as training and test data.

Technical factors such as accuracy and interpretability have been the main criteria for selecting machine learning methods. However, the success of implementing machine learning also affects management factors such as IT departments, operation departments, leadership, and organizational culture. Unfortunately, there are few integrated studies that understand the success factors of machine learning selection in which technical and management factors are considered together. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose and empirically analyze a technology-management integrated model that combines task-tech fit, IS Success Model theory, and John Rice’s algorithm selection process model to understand machine learning selection within the company. As a result of a survey of 240 companies that implemented machine learning, it was found that the higher the algorithm quality and data quality, the higher the algorithm-problem fit was perceived. It was also verified that algorithm-problem fit had a significant impact on the organization’s innovation and productivity. In addition, it was confirmed that outsourcing and management support had a positive impact on the quality of the machine learning system and organizational cultural factors such as data-driven management and motivation. Data-driven management and motivation were highly perceived in companies’ performance."

Because machine learning(ML) methods show much less computation cost than physics-based hydraulic models, they can predict the river salinity in a relatively short time. Due to shorter training time, ML methods have been studied as a complementary technique to physics-based hydraulic model. Many studies on salinity prediction based on machine learning have been studied actively around the world, but there are few studies in South Korea. With a massive number of datasets available publicly, we evaluated the performance of various kinds of machine learning techniques that predict the salinity of the Nakdong River Estuary Basin. As a result, LightGBM algorithm shows average 0.37 in RMSE as prediction performance and 2-20 times faster learning speed than other algorithms. This indicates that machine learning techniques can be applied to predict the salinity of rivers in Korea."

Using Census data from the 2005 and 2010 Jipgyegu levels (called Micro Census data), we employ the Getis-Ord Gi*, a spatial measurement tool, to detect the spatial patterns of urban decline. This study applies a gradient boosting algorithm to an urban decline prediction model using aggregated Eup-Myeong-Dong data from Jipgyegu levels. The 2005-2010 data are used to train, and the 2010-2015 data are used to test the machine learning model.Key findings from our empirical analyses are as follows. First, we observe different spatial distributions between Jipgyegu and Eup-Myeong-Dong levels, which implies that Jipgyegu level data would better explain the current situation for determining the policy. Second, an urban decline prediction model based on a gradient boosting algorithm shows that interregional migration, number of birth, and the ratio of dilapidated dwellings are the highest contribution to urban decline, which indicates the important factors predicting an urban decline. Third, the performance of a prediction model reveals that Accuracy is 0.69, Precision is 0.63, Recall is 0.99, and f1-score is 0.77.This study will provide an understanding of the urban decline prediction model based on machine learning algorithms and the necessity to elaborate the prediction model by adding a variety of variables to explain the urban decline.

This paper proposes a methodology that can effectively detect fraud transactions in electronic prepayment by machine learning algorithms, including support vector machines, decision trees, and artificial neural networks. Actual transaction data of electronic prepayment services were collected and preprocessed to extract the most relevant variables from raw data. Two different approaches were explored in the paper. One is a transaction-based approach, and the other is a user ID-based approach. For the transaction-based approach, the first model is primarily based on raw data features, while the second model uses extra features in addition to the first model. The user ID-based approach also used feature engineering to extract and transform the most relevant features. Overall, the user ID-based approach showed a better performance than the transaction-based approach, where the artificial neural networks showed the best performance. The proposed method could be used to reduce the damage caused by financial accidents by detecting and blocking fraud attempts."

SVM is then employed to the combined set of labeled and unlabeled observations to construct a classification rule. The use of SVM enables us to extend it to the nonlinear counterpart via kernel trick. Our numerical experiments under various scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method is promising in semi-supervised classification."

The proposed method performs image-based preprocessing by first photographing the top and front views of the input fish. Then, RANSAC(RANdom SAmple Consensus) is used to extract the fish contour line, and then 3D external information of the fish is obtained using 3D modeling. Next, machine learning is performed on the extracted three-dimensional feature information and measured weight information to generate a neural network model. Subsequently, the fish is cut at the cutting point predicted by the proposed technique, and then the weight of the cut piece is measured. We compared the measured weight with the target weight and evaluated the performance using evaluation methods such as MAE(Mean Absolute Error) and MRE(Mean Relative Error). The obtained results indicate that an average error rate of less than 3% was achieved in comparison to the target weight. The proposed technique is expected to contribute greatly to the development of the fishery industry in the future by being linked to the automation system."

The optimum production of strawberry is highly dependent on growing environment. Smart farm technology, and automatic monitoring and control system maintain a favorable environment for strawberry growth in greenhouses, as well as play an important role to improve production. Moreover, physiological parameters of strawberry plant and it is surrounding environment may allow to give an idea on production of strawberry. Therefore, this study intends to build a machine learning model to predict strawberry’s yield, cultivated in greenhouse. The environmental parameter like as temperature, humidity and CO₂ and physiological parameters such as length of leaves, number of flowers and fruits and chlorophyll content of ‘Seolhyang’ (widely growing strawberry cultivar in Korea) were collected from three strawberry greenhouses located in Sacheon of Gyeongsangnam-do during the period of 2019-2020. A predictive model, Lasso regression was designed and validated through 5-fold cross-validation. The current study found that performance of the Lasso regression model is good to predict the number of flowers and fruits, when the MAPE value are 0.511 and 0.488, respectively during the model validation. Overall, the present study demonstrates that using AI based regression model may be convenient for farms and agricultural companies to predict yield of crops with fewer input attributes."

Minimal Neural Network to Learn the Metal-insulator Transition in the Dynamical Mean-field Theory,2022,"['Neural network', 'Machine learning', 'Metal-insulator transition', 'Dynamical mean-field theory']",,We present a minimal neural network model to learn classifying the metallic and insulating phases from the real-frequency hybridization function computed in the dynamical mean-field theory for the repulsive Hubbard model at half-filling. The resulting neural network discriminates the phases essentially by reading the presence of the quasiparticle peak. The pattern observed in the weight matrix of neural connectivity allows us to write down a simple form of an indicator that can precisely detect the transition point only with the bath parameters building the Anderson impurity model. The proposed transition indicator is very sensitive to the emergence of zero energy orbital in the quantum bath. We demonstrate the accuracy of the indicator in the discrete bath description with a few orbitals for the exact diagonalization solver.

Prediction of Local Scour around Bridge Piers in the Cohesive Bed Using Support Vector Machines,2022,"['Local scour', 'Bridge pier', 'Cohesive bed', 'Support vector machines', 'Scour depth']",,"Local scour around bridge piers is one of the most important factors threatening the life of bridges. The three-dimensional highly complicated horseshoe vortex and downflow are known to be the main agents responsible for pier scour. If the bed consists of cohesive sediment, it will add another level of complexity to the pier scour problem. Various approaches have attempted to predict scour depth, but no universal method is available to date. This study presents a prediction of local scour around bridge piers in the cohesive bed using support vector machines (SVMs), a machine learning technique. The maximum scour depth is predicted with seven dimensional variables, including velocity, flow depth, size of bed sediment, pier width, clay content, water content, and bed shear strength. The training and validation of the SVMs are conducted with 197 data from six datasets. Comparisons are made with the training and validation of the adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) method. The training of the ANFIS method appears successful, but the validation fails because of overfitting. The predictions with dimensionless variables are compared, and shown to be worse. In addition, the SVMs are found to predict the maximum scour depths better than three existing formulas, gene expression programming (GEP), and a non-linear regression model. The SVMs are applied to two datasets, revealing the importance of the coverage of the training data. Finally, to investigate the contributions of each variable, the mean absolute percent errors (MAPEs) and correlation coefficient are computed by predicting the maximum scour depths by excluding each variable."

Sihwa Lake, one of specially-managed coastal zone, was selected as a modeling site. In this study, adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) and tree-based pipeline optimization (TPOT) algorithms were used to train models and each model performance was evaluated by metrics (accuracy, precision, F1, and Log loss) on classification. Before training, the feature importance and sensitivity analysis were conducted to find out the best input combination for each algorithm. The results proved that the bottom dissolved oxygen (DO<sub>Bot</sub>) was the most important variable affecting model performance. Conversely, surface dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN<sub>Sur</sub>) and dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP<sub>Sur</sub>) had weaker effects on the prediction of WQI class. In addition, the performance varied over features including stations, seasons, and WQI classes by comparing spatio-temporal and class sensitivities of each best model. In conclusion, the modeling results showed that the TPOT algorithm has better performance rather than the AdaBoost algorithm without considering feature selection. Moreover, the WQI class for unknown water quality datasets could be surely predicted using the TPOT model trained with satisfactory training datasets."

However, technology level survey from experts may lack objectivity and consume considerable time and costs. Therefore, this study was conducted to derive a methodology to measure the level of technology objectively and easily by using patent information. We attempted to measure the industrial technology level from patent information by linking survey results with the patent competitiveness data of 5 major countries in 80 industrial technology fields. Using various patent indices as independent variables and the technology level survey result as a dependent variable, linear regression analysis was performed, identifying the influence of each index on the determination of technology level. Next, the technology level was predicted using artificial neural networks, random forest, and XGboost, confirming the better performance of machine learning than linear regression method.This study is meaningful in that it developed a technology level evaluation methodology with improved accuracy by using various patent indices and machine learning. And we expect our research would be used as a tool to supplement the expert survey method."

The purpose of this study was to design and validate a machine learning model that automatically differential diagnosed patients with mild cognitive impairment and identified cognitive decline characteristics compared to a control group with nor- mal cognition using resting-state quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) with eyes closed. In the first step, a rec- tified signal was obtained through a preprocessing process that receives a quantitative EEG signal as an input and removes noise through a filter and independent component analysis (ICA). Frequency analysis and non-linear features were extracted from the rectified signal, and the 3067 extracted features were used as input of a linear support vector machine (SVM), a representative algorithm among machine learning algorithms, and classified into mild cognitive impairment patients and normal cognitive adults. As a result of classification analysis of 58 normal cognitive group and 80 patients in mild cognitive impairment, the accuracy of SVM was 86.2%. In patients with mild cognitive impair- ment, alpha band power was decreased in the frontal lobe, and high beta band power was increased in the frontal lobe compared to the normal cognitive group. Also, the gamma band power of the occipital-parietal lobe was decreased in mild cognitive impairment. These results represented that quantitative EEG can be used as a mean- ingful biomarker to discriminate cognitive decline."

One wayto cope with a fall accident is to determine the fall direction before impact using a wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU).In this context, a previous study proposed a method of classifying fall directions using a support vector machine with sensorvelocity, acceleration, and tilt angle as input parameters. However, in this method, the IMU signals are processed throughseveral processes, including a Kalman filter and the integration of acceleration, which involves a large amount of computationand error factors. Therefore, this paper proposes a machine learning-based method that classifies the fall direction before impact using IMU raw signals rather than processed data. In this study, we investigated the effects of the followingtwo factors on the classification performance: (1) the usage of processed/raw signals and (2) the selection of machine learning techniques. First, as a result of comparing the processed/raw signals, the difference in sensitivities between the two methods was within 5%, indicating an equivalent level of classification performance. Second, as a result of comparing sixmachine learning techniques, K-nearest neighbor and naive Bayes exhibited excellent performance with a sensitivity of86.0% and 84.1%, respectively."

Cloud detection in satellite images is a very difficult task to separate clouds and non-cloud areas because of similar reflectance characteristics to some other ground objects or the ground surface. In contrast to thick clouds, which have distinct characteristics, thin transparent clouds have weak contrast between clouds and background in satellite images and appear mixed with the ground surface. In order to overcome the limitations of transparent clouds in cloud detection, this study conducted cloud detection focusing on transparent clouds using machine learning techniques (Random Forest [RF], Convolutional Neural Networks [CNN]). As reference data, Cloud Mask and Cirrus Mask were used in MOD35 data provided by MOderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and the pixel ratio of training data was configured to be about 1:1:1 for clouds, transparent clouds, and clear sky for model training considering transparent cloud pixels. As a result of the qualitative comparison of the study, bothRF and CNN successfully detected various types of clouds, including transparent clouds, and in the case of RF+CNN, which mixed the results of the RF model and the CNN model, the cloud detection was well performed, and was confirmed that the limitations of the model were improved.

If the joint moves abnormally, the pressure applied to the cartilage is not evenly dispersed, causing pain, which can be said to be the main cause of PFP. The goal of this study is to develop an algorithm that can predict patellofemoral pain using only three-dimensional (3-D) computed tomography (CT) images acquired under a weight-bearing posture. A total of eight two-dimensional (2-D) or 3-D metrics that quantitatively represent the alignment of the patellofemoral joint were measured. The coordinates of the anatomical landmarks necessary to derive the corresponding quantitative metrics from the acquired CT images were extracted by three experienced evaluators. The correlation between the eight metrics and pain scale was analyzed using nine representative machine learning-based algorithms. As a result, the proposed algorithms were able to effectively predict the pain level with a high accuracy of less than 10%, and the error based on the highest performance algorithm for each biomarker was set."

As the awareness of the importance of the walking environment has increased, many studies have been conducted to identify the physical components that constitute the walking environment and to find out what kind of walking environment people consider good for walking. Existing methods for analyzing the qualitative walking environment based on surveys targeting residents or experts showed limitations in their representativeness. On the other hand, the recent development of high-resolution street view images and deep learning technology makes it possible to obtain detailed perceived walkability scores by using paired comparison data for street view images as a training set. However, perceived walkability score prediction based on deep learning technology has limitations in providing an answer to why such evaluation score was obtained. The purpose of this study is to analyze the characteristics of the urban landscape that affect the perceived walkability based on street view images. In this study, we tested various machine learning models with the perceived walkability score of the street image as the dependent variable and the semantic segmentation ratio value of the street view image as the independent variable. According to our study, the regression equation of the support vector machine was the most accurate. And in predicting the perceived walkability score, the importance of the object was in the order of roads, sidewalks, buildings, trees, and the sky. Our study showed that the higher the segmentation value, the higher the perceived walkability score for sidewalk, streetlight, road, grass, and tree. On the contrary, the higher the segmentation value, the lower the score for ashcans, mountains, trucks, and walls. This study is meaningful in that it was possible to identify important objects and their direction that affect the evaluation of the walking environment through the machine learning model, and to partially explain the perceived walkability score predicted by the deep learning model."

The ratio of each material required for concrete is determined through the mixing design, but the strength of concrete cannot be known until experimentally measured. To overcome this limitation, many studies have used statistical mathematics and machine learning algorithms to predict the compressive strength of concrete using data obtained through experiments. Previous studies have proposed neural networks for predicting the compressive strength of concrete, but they are computationally expensive and difficult to apply in practice. As various regression models have been recently developed, a concrete strength prediction model was presented using recently developed regression models instead of a neural network with low computational efficiency. First, an optimal model was selected by the cross-verification procedure for the regression analysis models. Hyper-parameters of each selected model were optimized through grid search, and machine learning models were trained. The models that showed excellent performance in predicting the concrete compressive strength were CatBoost Regression(CatBoost), LGBM Regression(LGBMR), Random Forest Regression(RFR), and XGBoost Regression (XGBoost) models. The XGBoost regression model had the lowest error and best accuracy. The LGBM model, which shows lower performance, is better than the neural networks and ensemble models proposed in previous studies. The compressive strength prediction for ready-mixed concrete was also good, confirming the field applicability of these models."
계산화학과 기계학습을 이용한 촉매 개발,2022,"['Machine Learning', 'Density Functional Theory Calculations', 'Computational Catalysis', 'Oxygen Reduction/Evolution Reaction', 'Data Mining']",,"Towards a sustainable energy future, it is essential to develop new catalysts with improved properties for key catalytic systems such as Haber-Bosch process, water electrolysis and fuel cell. Unfortunately, the current state-of-the-art catalysts still suffer from high cost of noble metals, insufficient catalytic activity and long-term stability. Furthermore, the current strategy to develop new catalysts relies on “trial-and-error” method, which could be time-consuming and inefficient. To tackle this challenge, atomic-level simulations have demonstrated the potential to facilitate catalyst discovery. For the past decades, the simulations have become reasonably accurate so that they can provide useful insights toward the origin of experimentally observed improvements in catalytic properties. In addition, with the exponential increase in computing power, high-throughput catalyst screening has become feasible. More excitingly, recent advances in machine learning have opened the possibility to further accelerate catalyst discovery. Herein, we introduce recent applications and challenges of computation and machine learning for catalyst discovery."

The dimensional extended data comprises statistics of the earthquake information from the Global Centroid Moment Tensor catalog containing 36,699 seismic events. We perform data preprocessing using standard and max-min scaling and extract dominant features with principal components analysis from the scaled dataset. The scaling methods significantly reduced the deviation of feature values caused by different units. Among them, the standard scaling method transforms the median of each feature with a smaller deviation than other scaling methods. The six principal components extracted from the non-scaled dataset explain 99% of the original data. The sixteen principal components from the datasets, which are applied with standardization or max-min scaling, reconstruct 98% of the original datasets. These results indicate that more principal components are needed to preserve original data information with even distributed feature values.

Based on the data on the smartphone usage pattern obtained through the questionnaire, the smartphone addiction level was predicted using machine learning techniques. k-NN, gradient boosting, XGBoost, CatBoost, AdaBoost and random forest algorithms were employed.Findings - First, while various factors together influence the smartphone overdependence level, the results show that all machine learning techniques perform well to predict the smartphone overdependence level. Especially, we focus on the features which can be obtained from the smartphone log data (without psychological factors). It means that our results can be a basis for diagnostic programs to detect problematic smartphone use. Second, the results show that information on users’ age, marriage and smartphone usage patterns can be used as predictors to determine whether users are addicted to smartphones. Other demographic characteristics such as sex or region did not appear to significantly affect smartphone overdependence levels.Research implications or Originality - While there are some studies that predict smartphone overdependence level using machine learning techniques, but the studies only present algorithm performance based on survey data. In this study, based on the information gain measure, questions that have more influence on the smartphone overdependence level are presented, and the performance of algorithms according to the questions is compared.

The food exchange table, which is the standard for the composition of the diet, takes a lot of manpower and time in the process of revision through the National Health and Nutrition Survey, making it difficult to quickly reflect food changes according to new foods or trends.

The physical-based empirical equation, which had been previously proposed with experimental data, was labelled and used in the present study. While it had a smaller number of coefficients, the prediction accuracy of the physical-based empirical equation was almost similar to that of the regression model based on the response surface method. The prediction accuracy of the machine learning models clearly improved as the number of layers increased and became more complicated in structure before the model began to overfit. The key point we found was that a single layered neural network model with optimized hyperparameters resulted in similar or better hardness prediction performance compared to deep learning models with a more complex architecture. We also analyzed 18 research papers from the literature which used neural network models to predict the hardness of steels. Only two recent papers adopted a convolutional neural network, as a kind of deep learning model, in a new attempt to predict hardness. The other 16 papers from 1998 to 2021 commonly chose shallow neural network models because a more complicated model is less effective than a simple model for regression problems with well-labeled experimental data in materials science and engineering."

To date, ‘smart regulation’, such as innovation procurement, has attempted to reconcile conflict between innovation and regulation, but, thanks to recent new digital technologies, such as big data and artificial intelligent (A.I.), the opportunity of this co-evolution is increasing. A good example of this intelligent evolution would be ‘Reg-tech’ which offers more advanced financial service while decreasing the costs for financial transaction monitoring using information and communication technology (ICT).

The comparison of traditional expert based audit and four different machine learning analysis results suggest that the proposed approach shows better performance. Our illustrative case suggests promising possibility of intelligent co-evolution between regulation and technological innovation. To date, regulation enforcement has been a feed-back process, in which a violation of regulation precedes and penalty for the violation follows. However, big data and accurate machine learning technology changes this traditional process from feed-back to feed-forward.

During an e+e- collider process, a pair of B meson is created, one of which is regarded as a signal and reconstructed for analysis. The automatic reconstruction of the other B meson can enhance the quality of signal events by controlling information produced from another B meson. This technique is useful particularly when a complete reconstruction of signal B is impossible because of invisible particles are included in the decay mode such as neutrino. In utilizing automatic reconstruction, a ‘tagging’ method has been developed and used in B meson analyses. In this paper, we studied the tagging method of ‘other’ B meson using machine learning algorithms such as artificial neural networks and boosted decision trees. We also applied automatic reconstruction and checked its effect on the analysis of lepton-flavor-violating decay modes with simulation data. The result shows that automatic reconstruction effectively reduces background events and provides separation between signal and background."
기계학습 접근법에 기반한 유전자 선택 방법들에 대한 리뷰,2022,,,"Gene expression data present the level of mRNA abundance of each gene, and analyses of gene expressions have provided key ideas for understanding the mechanism of diseases and developing new drugs and therapies. Nowadays high-throughput technologies such as DNA microarray and RNA-sequencing enabled the simultaneous measurement of thousands of gene expressions, giving rise to a characteristic of gene expression data known as high dimensionality. Due to the high-dimensionality, learning models to analyze gene expression data are prone to overfitting problems, and to solve this issue, dimension reduction or feature selection techniques are commonly used as a preprocessing step. In particular, we can remove irrelevant and redundant genes and identify important genes using gene selection methods in the preprocessing step. Various gene selection methods have been developed in the context of machine learning so far. In this paper, we intensively review recent works on gene selection methods using machine learning approaches.

However, in the case of industrial equipment, various operating conditions occur, and it is difficult to secure sufficient training data. To solve this problem, a cross-domain adaptation technique can be utilized. In this study, we propose an adversarial consistency-maintaining transformation learning method that can maintain failure classification consistency even for the new untrained environmental data using the rotating body vibration data. The data generated through consistent learning creates a continuous invariant latent space between the new operating condition data distribution and the known data distribution and learns to maintain the failure classification performance through an adversarial learning network that shares the failure classification characteristic nformation. Therefore, the proposed method can provide a more stable and general classification performance by expanding the potential space to minimize the discrepancy between domain data. The experimental results of the proposed model showed about 88% accuracy for a real-machine dataset, and compared to the existing cross-domain adaptive learning methods, it showed a performance improvement of about 5-10%.

The mineral composition, Ti concentration, spectral characteristics of Myeonsan and non-Myeonsan formation of Joseon supergroup were analyzed. The Myeonsan formation contains relatively larger quantity of opaque minerals along with quartz and clay minerals. The PXRF analysis revealed that the Ti concentration of Myeosan formation is at least 10 times larger than the other formations with bi-modal distribution. The bi-modal concentration is caused by high Ti concentrated sandy layer and relatively lower Ti concentrated muddy layer. The spectral characteristics of Myeonsan formation is manifested by Fe oxides at near infrared and clay minerals at shortwave infrared bands. The Ti exploration is expected to be more effective on detection of hostrock rather than Ti ore because ilmenite does not have characteristic spectral features. The random-forest machine learning classification detected the Myeonsan fomation at 85% accuracy with overall accuracy of 97%, where spectral features of iron oxides and clay minerals played an important role. It indicates that spectral analysis can detect the Ti host rock effectively, and can contribute for UAV based remote sensing for Ti exploration."

BLE 신호 기반 기계학습을 이용한 재실 여부 결정 방법,2022,,,"Various indoor location-based services can be provided through indoor presence determination and indoor positioning technology using Beacon. However, since the BLE signal advertised by the beacon has an unstable RSSI due to problems such as multi-path fading, it is difficult to guarantee the accuracy of indoor presence determination. In this paper, data were collected while the classroom door was open to ensure accuracy in various situations. Based on the collected data, we propose an indoor presence determination method considering the characteristics of the signal. The proposed method uses support vector machine, showed about 10% accuracy improvement compared to the results using raw RSSI only. This method has the advantage of being able to accurately determine indoor presence with only one receiver. It is expected that the proposed method can implement a low-cost system for determining indoor presence with high accuracy."

In this research, forecast models of forest fire risk at a mid-range (with lead times up to 7 days) scale were developed considering past, present and future conditions (i.e., forest fire risk, drought, and weather) through random forest machine learning over South Korea. The models were developed using weather forecast data from the Global Data Assessment and Prediction System, historical and current Fire Risk Index (FRI) information, and environmental factors (i.e., elevation, forest fire hazard index, and drought index). Three schemes were examined: scheme 1 using historical values of FRI and drought index, scheme 2 using historical values of FRI only, and scheme 3 using the temporal patterns of FRI and drought index. The models showed high accuracy (Pearson correlation coefficient >0.8, relative root mean square error <10%), regardless of the lead times, resulting in a good agreement with actual forest fire events. The use of the historical FRI itself as an input variable rather than the trend of the historical FRI produced more accurate results, regardless of the drought index used."

Sentinel-1에서 얻을 수 있는 이중편파 산란계수는 토양수분 거동과 유의미한 상관성을 가지고 있음을 확인할 수 있었으며, 다른 위성이나 지점에서 관측된 보조자료를 사용하지 않고도 식생의 효과 등을 보정할 수 있는 자립형 활용 가능성도 확인할 수 있었다. 하지만 각 지점별, 지형 그룹별 특성에 의한 차이가 크게 나타났으며, 특히 산지와 평지에서 학습된 모형을 교차적용하였을 때 토양수분을 제대로 모의할 수 없는 현상이 발생하였다. 또한 이러한 문제를 해결하고자 학습 지점의 수를 늘리는 경우에는 토양수분 복원 모형이 평활화되어 상관계수는 증가하였으나, 지점에서의 오차는점점 증가하였다. 따라서 고해상도 SAR 토양수분 자료를 광범위하게 적용하기 위해서는 체계적 연구 수행이선행되어야 하며, 목적에 따른 학습 지점의 선정, 적용 지역의 범위 등을 구체적으로 제한하여 활용한다면 다양한 분야에서 효과적으로 활용할 수 있을 것으로 기대된다.","As the threat of natural disasters such as droughts, floods, forest fires, and landslides increases due to climate change, social demand for high-resolution soil moisture retrieval, such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), is also increasing. However, the domestic environment has a high proportion of mountainous topography, making it challenging to retrieve soil moisture from SAR data. This study evaluated the usability of Sentinel-1 SAR, which is applied with the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) technique, to retrieve soil moisture. It was confirmed that the backscattering coefficient obtained from Sentinel-1 significantly correlated with soil moisture behavior, and the possibility of stand-alone use to correct vegetation effects without using auxiliary data observed from other satellites or observatories. However, there was a large difference in the characteristics of each site and topographic group. In particular, when the model learned on the mountain and at flat land cross-applied, the soil moisture could not be properly simulated. In addition, when the number of learning points was increased to solve this problem, the soil moisture retrieval model was smoothed. As a result, the overall correlation coefficient of all sites improved, but errors at individual sites gradually increased. Therefore, systematic research must be conducted in order to widely apply high-resolution SAR soil moisture data. It is expected that it can be effectively used in various fields if the scope of learning sites and application targets are specifically limited."

As a series of efforts for impact assessment procedures, a national inventory-based database was established for urban development projects, and three machine learning model performance evaluation as well as soil pollutant concentration distribution mapping were conducted. Here, nine soil pollutants were mapped to the metropolitan area of South Korea using the Random Forest model, which showed the best performance. The results of this study found that concentrations of Zn, F, and Cd were relatively concerned in Seoul, where urbanization is the most active. In addition, in the case of Hg and Cr6+, concentrations were detected below the standard, which was derived from a lack of pollutants such as industrial and industrial complexes that affect contents of heavy metals. A significant correlation between land cover and pollutants was inferred through the spatial distribution mapping of soil pollutants. Through this, it is expected that efficient soil management measures for minimizing soil pollution and planning decisions regarding the location of the project site can be established."

However, frequent background operations lead to additional loads on Redis such as delayed processing and more memory usage. To mitigate these loads on Redis, a preceding study that performed parameter tuning only consider linear correlation to extract meaningful parameters. To address this problem, we performed parameter tuning using non-linear machine learning methods. The model analyzed parameters which are influential on Redis performance, and decides the optimal values for each parameter to draw higher data processing performance. Through the extracted configuration, we measured throughput for each persistence method and confirmed the performance improvement up to 45.9% over the default parameter setting."

And finally, in Study 3, musical genres are predicted using the input variables derived from Studies 1 and 2 as well as machine learning methodology. We confirmed that lyrical themes and sentiment variables could increase the accuracy of the estimation model in comparison to genre prediction that relied only on audio characteristics. Furthermore, we found that lyrical characteristics contribute more to genre estimation than audio characteristics when a specific genre has differentiation in its lyrical content. We believe that this study can be extended to predict music needed for specific applications, including in advertising.

The biggest difference between machine learning and deep learning is that in the learning of artificial intelligence models, machine learning basically requires a human feature extraction process before learning, but deep learning does not require this process and the original data is directly used as input. The development of deep learning coincides with the development of artificial neural networks (ANNs), and many people have contributed to the development of artificial neural networks for decades. The following five models are the representative architectures most widely used in deep learning. That is, Deep Feedforward Neural Network (DFFNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Deep Belief Network (DBN), Autoencoders (AE), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a feedforward NN composed of a convolutional layer, a ReLU activation function, and a pooling layer. CNNs provide properties of weight sharing and local connectivity to process high-dimensional data. In dental and medical fields, an AI model that can be interpretable or explainable (XAI) is needed to increase patient persuasiveness. In the future, explainable AI (XAI) will become an indispensable and practical component in order to obtain an improved, transparent, secure, fair and unbiased AI learning model."

In this study, we proposed a learning platform based on artificial intelligence technology that induces optimized learning in consideration of the characteristics of scientists and engineers. An important function of the platform is to extract key keywords using the natural language processing method and to recommend learners with high similarity through learning through machine learning. In the new platform, the scope of learning was expanded from formal learning to informal learning, and internal and external integrated data including the entire research activities of scientists and engineers were collected to increase the connectivity between science and technology personnel. Scientists and engineers network with learners who have similar interests and research topics based on the learning platform, share the latest scientific and technological information, and realize true self-directed learning. Education data, which is science and technology accumulated through the operation of the learning platform, is high-value data that has not been systematically collected before. It can be used as a scientific basis for learners, instructors, educators, and policy makers to formulate an efficient and optimized human resource development plan.

As the advancement of neural-network MT will further accelerate this trend in the near future, more students will utilize MT in language learning. Despite the considerable number of recent publications on MT, Korean secondary students’ perceptions and use of MT have been rarely investigated. Therefore, the current study explored Korean middle school students’ perceptions and behaviors in using MT in their daily lives and in language learning. The study employed a survey as quantitative data (primary) and screen recordings of the students’ writing processes as qualitative data (secondary). The results showed that most of the students already used MT in language learning. Although they viewed MT as an imperfect tool, they considered MT helpful and useful in learning English. The study also showed that the students’ perceptions varied according to their English proficiencies. The analysis of the screen recordings indicated that the lower-level students translated larger chunks of language and accepted MT outputs uncritically. Based on the results, the study suggests pedagogical implications to effectively utilize MT in the middle school English classroom based on the results."

The anomaly detection methodology applies the LIME algorithm after applying the SMOTE method and the RFECV method. The proposed methodology analyzes the classification result of the anomaly classification model, detects the cause of the anomaly, and derives a semiconductor process requiring action. The proposed methodology confirmed applicability and feasibility through application of cases."

As for the diagnosis, a fundus photography is popular. However, it is very difficult to make exact diagnosis due to blurred images, diagnosis time and human errors, which results in misdiagnosis and blindness in worst case scenario. To solve the problems, machine learning based diagnosis systems were suggested. However, the machine learning based systems inevitably contained expert parameters, like C for margins and gamma for boundary conditions as in support vector machines. Recently, as deep learning methods have been popular, the convolutional neural network (CNN) based image classifications are being used for eye disease diagnosis. However, the previous researches did not use balanced datasets and showed only accuracies for performance verifications. This paper proposes deep learning based eye disease diagnosis systems and balanced datasets are used for better performance. In addition, F1 score and receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curve with area under ROC curve (AUC) including accuracies are measured for exact performance verification. As for classes, normal, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, cataracts, glaucoma, and pathological myopia, i.e., six classes are defined. Moreover, as a dataset, total 4965 data images are used. From the experimental result, we achieved 0.901 as an average F1 score."

The PDR consists of three components: step detection, stride length estimation, and direction estimation. In the indoor environment, although the step detection and the stride length estimation obtain accurate results relatively, the direction estimation accuracy can be easily affected by the cumulative errors and the magnetic noises. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based direction estimation scheme by taking into account the gyroscope drift problem and the external magnetic field effects. The proposed scheme collects the IMU data when the user freely walks with the smartphone as the training data and labels the data using the actual walking direction as the output data.

The novel includes a large number of culture-specific items (CSI) related to Korea, as a result the machine-translated text has many errors. The students discuss what types of CSI are found in the source text (ST), and learn how to better translate these cultural elements in Pachinko's MT results. This study presents three effective methods to educate undergraduate students in cultural translation class. First, the concept of culture and CSI should be more clearly taught. Second, the source text (ST) must be thoroughly explained in order that students can discuss the cultural elements that are not explicitly expressed in the text. Third, students should be educated to find implied contextual information in cultural text.

The proposed method calculates confusion rates between every pair of classes in the entire dataset, and then it adjusts the magnitudes and directions of gradients considering the confusion rates in training. This method prevents the embedding of a data sample from becoming closer to the embeddings of data samples whose classes are likely to be confused, and thus it helps the model generate fine-grained embeddings. By using real-life image benchmarks, we show that our method outperforms the existing metric learning for a zero-shot image retrieval which searches for the classes not used during training."

Also, the importance of precision agriculture has been growing in recent years. Notably, yield monitoring is an important precision agricultural technology of increasing interest that can be used in variable fertilization, supply/demand control, etc. However, yield monitoring research is not conducted actively in South Korea compared to other countries, such as the United States and Japan. Hence, this research developed a potato yield monitoring system to count the potatoes harvested by a potato harvester. In particular, this system used machine vision and a deep learning algorithm. First, the YOLOv5 object detection model identified the potatoes and other substances, such as stone, soil, and potato plant stem, on the potato harvester's conveyor. Further, each harvested potato identified by the YOLOv5 object detection model was assigned a unique ID by the DeepSORT deep learning algorithm to trace the harvested potatoes. Finally, these harvested potatoes were counted when they arrived at a certain point on the potato harvester's conveyor. A performance test on this potato yield monitoring system's YOLOv5 object detection model showed that this model had a precision, recall, mAP, and F1 score of 0.9997, 0.9994, 0.9872, and 0.9996, respectively. Hence, this research demonstrated machine vision and deep learning in a potato yield monitoring system. However, further research on the potato yield monitoring system developed by this research is necessary to create potato yield maps based on potato weight estimation and GPS."

Mean-absolute-error (MAE), peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity (SSIM) were used as metrics to evaluate the performance of the models. First, a super-resolution image (SR) was obtained using the traditional interpolation method used in computer vision.In the SR image at low magnification, the shape of the nanomaterial improved. However, the SR images at medium and high magnification failed to show the characteristics of the lattice of the nanomaterials. Second, to obtain a SR image, the deep learning model includes a residual network which reduces the loss of spatial information in the convolutional process of obtaining a feature map. In the process of optimizing the deep learning model, it was confirmed that the performance of the model improved as the number of data increased. In addition, by optimizing the deep learning model using the loss function, including MAE and SSIM at the same time, improved results of the nanomaterial lattice in SR images were achieved at medium and high magnifications. The final proposed deep learning model used four residual blocks to obtain the characteristic map of the low-resolution image, and the super-resolution image was completed using Upsampling2D and the residual block three times."

In particular, Korean has unique linguistic word and expression features, which might cause mistranslation. For example, in Google Translate from Korean to English, mistranslations occur when a noun in Korean ends with the postposition (josa) in the form of a single consonant. Also, in the English-Korean translations, the honorifics and casual expressions are mixed in the translated results. This is because the alphabetic characteristics and honorifics of the Korean language are not reflected.

An experiment was conducted with SQuAD1.1 datasets. BM25 recorded a higher performance of document research than TF-IDF by 3.2%. InferSent showed a higher performance in paragraph selection than Transformer by 0.9%. Finally, as the number of paragraphs increased in document comprehension, ALBERT was 0.4% higher in EM and 0.2% higher in F1."

In order to create a model using artificial intelligence technology, it is usually necessary to gather data in one place so that it can be updated, but this can infringe users' privacy. In this paper, we introduce federated learning, a distributed machine learning method that can update models in cooperation without directly sharing distributed stored data, and introduce a study to optimize distributed consensus among participants without an existing server. In addition, we propose a pattern and group-based distributed consensus optimization algorithm that uses an algorithm for generating patterns and groups based on the Kirkman Triple System, and performs parallel updates and communication. This algorithm guarantees more privacy than the existing distributed consensus optimization algorithm and reduces the communication time until the model converges."

In particular, outdoor workers directly exposed to the heat are at higher risk of heat stroke; therefore, preventing heat-related illnesses and managing safety have become important. Although various wearable devices have been developed to prevent heat stroke for outdoor workers, applying various sensors to the safety helmets that workers must wear is an excellent alternative. In this study, we developed a smart helmet that measures various vital signs of the wearer such as body temperature, heart rate, and sweat rate; external environmental signals such as temperature and humidity; and movement signals of the wearer such as roll and pitch angles. The smart helmet can acquire the various data by connecting with a smartphone application. Environmental data can check the status of heat wave advisory, and the individual vital signs can monitor the health of workers. In addition, we developed an algorithm that classifies the risk of heat-related illness as normal and abnormal by inputting a set of vital signs of the wearer using a support vector machine technique, which is a machine learning technique that allows for rapid binary classification with high reliability.

First, the features, including the fault characteristic of the vibration signals, are extracted, and these features are selected to reduce the dimension of the features. These features are input into the machine learning classifier to diagnose the system's health. In addition to machine learning methods, CNN, one of the deep learning methods, is widely used.Since the deep learning model extracts features by itself, only the preprocessing process of converting the bearing signals into 2D is needed.

Additionally, it was shown that the machine learning models that could best predict the relaxation-arousal state from the EEG data of users experiencing a virtual reality space was the artificial neural network model with five hidden layers applied with the frequency-specific statistics and filtering-based feature processing method; its predictive accuracy was 70.21%. The results of this study could be useful basic data to implement an automated system that evaluates the design drafts of a healing space by utilizing virtual reality and EEG data."
XGB 및 LGBM을 활용한 Ti-6Al-4V 적층재의 변형 거동 예측,2022,"['machine learning', 'extreme gradient boosting', 'light gradient boosting machine', 'additive manufacturing', 'Ti-6Al-4V']",,"The present study employed two different machine-learning approaches, the extreme gradient boosting (XGB) and light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), to predict a compressive deformation behavior of additively manufactured Ti-6Al-4V. Such approaches have rarely been verified in the field of metallurgy in contrast to artificial neural network and its variants. XGB and LGBM provided a good prediction for elongation to failure under an extrapolated condition of processing parameters. The predicting accuracy of these methods was better than that of response surface method. Furthermore, XGB and LGBM with optimum hyperparameters well predicted a deformation behavior of Ti-6Al-4V additively manufactured under the extrapolated condition. Although the predicting capability of two methods was comparable, LGBM was superior to XGB in light of six-fold higher rate of machine learning. It is also noted this work has verified the LGBM approach in solving the metallurgical problem for the first time."
Malaysian Name-based Ethnicity Classification using LSTM,2022,"['Deep Learning', 'Recurrent Neural Network', 'LSTM', 'Machine Learning', 'Ethnicity Classification', 'Malaysian Name Separation', 'Deep Learning-based Name Separation']",,"Name separation (splitting full names into surnames and given names) is not a tedious task in a multiethnic country because the procedure for splitting surnames and given names is ethnicity-specific. Malaysia has multiple main ethnic groups; therefore, separating Malaysian full names into surnames and given names proves a challenge. In this study, we develop a two-phase framework for Malaysian name separation using deep learning. In the initial phase, we predict the ethnicity of full names. We propose a recurrent neural network with long short-term memory network–based model with character embeddings for prediction. Based on the predicted ethnicity, we use a rule-based algorithm for splitting full names into surnames and given names in the second phase. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model against various machine learning models and demonstrate that it outperforms them by an average of 9%. Moreover, transfer learning and fine-tuning of the proposed model with an additional dataset results in an improvement of up to 7% on average."

Due to this, there is a problem that the existing data collection method cannot be reused ina new environment, and a specialized data collection module must be developed each time.

A study on Natural Disaster Prediction Using Multi-Class Decision Forest,2022,"['Natural disaster', 'Afghanistan', 'Azure Machine Learning', 'Muliclass Decision Forest']",,"In this paper, a study was conducted to predict natural disasters in Afghanistan based on machine learning. Natural disasters need to be prepared not only in Korea but also in other vulnerable countries. Every year in Afghanistan, natural disasters(snow, earthquake, drought, flood) cause property and casualties. We decided to conduct research on this phenomenon because we thought that the damage would be small if we were to prepare for it. The Azure Machine Learning Studio used in the study has the advantage of being more visible and easier to use than other Machine Learning tools. Decision Forest is a model for classifying into decision tree types. Decision forest enables intuitive analysis as a model that is easy to analyze results and presents key variables and separation criteria. Also, since it is a nonparametric model, it is free to assume (normality, independence, equal dispersion) required by the statistical model. Finally, linear/non-linear relationships can be searched considering interactions between variables. Therefore, the study used decision forest. The study found that overall accuracy was 89 percent and average accuracy was 97 percent. Although the results of the experiment showed a little high accuracy, items with low natural disaster frequency were less accurate due to lack of learning. By learning and complementing more data, overall accuracy can be improved, and damage can be reduced by predicting natural disasters."
노이즈 환경에서 효과적인 로봇 강화 학습의 정책 탐색 방법,2022,"['Robotic Arm', 'Reinforcement Learning', 'Bottle Flipping', 'Policy Search']",,"Robots are widely used in industries and services. Traditional robots have been used to perform repetitive tasks in a fixed environment, and it is very difficult to solve a problem in which the physical interaction of the surrounding environment or other objects is complicated with the existing control method. Reinforcement learning has been actively studied as a method of machine learning to solve such problems, and provides answers to problems that robots have not solved in the conventional way. Studies on the learning of all physical robots are commonly affected by noise. Complex noises, such as control errors of robots, limitations in performance of measurement equipment, and complexity of physical interactions with surrounding environments and objects, can act as factors that degrade learning. A learning method that works well in a virtual environment may not very effective in a real robot. Therefore, this paper proposes a weighted sum method and a linear regression method as an effective and accurate learning method in a noisy environment. In addition, the bottle flipping was trained on a robot and compared with the existing learning method, the validity of the proposed method was verified."

To solve this problem, research on explainable AI(XAI), which helps interpret and understand decisions in machine learning, is increasing in various fields.

AI에는 다양한 이미지가 있지만, 현시점에서는 금융기관으로부터 AI 기술을 활용한 만능의 ‘은행원’을 만들어 달라는 요구는 오지 않았다. AI는 사람을 돕고 사람과 협업하는 도구로 고객 및 직원의 편의성 향상을 위해 사용돼야 한다.T&I 이노베이션 센터에서는, 지방은행의 요망에 근거해 최초로 IBM의 Watson을 사용해 기계학습, 심층학습이란 어떠한 것인가를 확인했다. 그 결과 여러 개의 POC를 할 필요 없이 우선 AI를 제대로 이해하고 어떻게 하면 잘 다룰 수 있는지 생각하는 것이 중요하다는 것이다. 현재는 자신이 무엇에 AI를 사용하고 싶은가, 이 부분을 AI가 해주면 도움이 된다 혹은 AI가 여기까지 해주면 된다 라고 하는 형태로, 적절히 한계설정을 하면서 사용하는 것이라고 느끼고 있다.AI를 사용하는 측은 이 분야는 이 정도 비용으로 여기까지 할 수 있으면 된다는 발상으로 생각해야 한다. AI는 자동차와 같은 존재이기 때문에 차를 능숙하게 타는 것처럼 AI 도구를 사용할 수 있게 되면 된다. 게다가 마케팅이나 자산운용 등에 활용하면 되고, 언론에 놀아난 AI 기초연구를 하는 것은 그만두는 것이 좋다. AI 도입 후 은행에서는 사무부문에서 영업부문으로 인력을 이관시킬 것으로 예상된다. 사무 프로세스를 알 수 있고 영업 센스가 있는 직원은 영업으로서의 성능도 높을 것으로 보인다. AI 활용으로 일하는 방식은 달라지고 있다. 콜센터, 의사록, 문서처리 등 AI를 이용한 사무효율화를 추진하고 있지만, 잉여 사무담당자를 영업담당자로 배치 전환한다고 해서 당장 높은 성능을 얻을 수 있지는 않을 것이다. AI의 활용에 의해 일하는 방식을 바꾸는 것에 대해서도 검토를 거듭하지 않으면 안 된다. AI는 화상분석이나 음성분석에 강한 반면 데이터의 의미를 해석하기는 어려운 것으로 알려져 있어 AI에 적합한 분야를 따져 자원을 투입할 필요가 있다.실제로 인간을 지원하는 관점에서 기계학습을 활용하려는 움직임이 많아졌다고 생각한다. 어떠한 과제를 해결하는데, 기계학습을 사용할 수 있는가 하는 것을 의식하면서, 적절한 모델을 구축해 나가는 것이 중요하다고 생각하고 있다. 금융기관의 AI 활용 상황을 보면 비정형 정보 취급 프로세스 개선 방안으로 도입되는 사례가 많다. 구체적으로는 고객의 문의에 대한 음성인식이나 문서입력에 있어서의 AI와 OCR의 조합에 의한 읽기 등이다. 이에 따라 후속 사무가 디지털화되어 효율화가 도모된다.구체적인 서비스로는 챗봇(AI 학습을 통해 FAQ를 자동 작성하고 언어 흔들림을 심층학습으로 조정), 안티 자금세탁, 신용카드 부정탐지 등이 있다. 발밑 AI 활용은 비용절감과 인력감축 등 ROI를 내기 쉬운 분야에서 진행되고 있다. 또 데이터 활용이라는 관점에서는 빅데이터를 포함해 소관하는 AI 전문 부문을 설치해 하나의 도구로 대응하고 있다.

There are various images of AI, but at this point, there has been no request from financial institutions to create an all-round ‘banker’ using AI technology. AI is a tool that helps and collaborates with people, and should be used to improve convenience for customers and employees.At the T&I Innovation Center, based on the request of a regional bank, for the first time, IBM’s Watson was used to confirm machine learning and deep learning. As a result, it is important to first understand AI properly and think about how to handle it well, without having to do multiple POCs. Currently, I feel that I am using it while setting limits appropriately in the form of what I want to use the AI ​​for, it will be helpful if the AI ​​does this part, or if the AI ​​can do it up to this point.Those who use AI should think of this field as an idea that can be done up to this point at this cost. Since AI is like a car, you can use AI tools as if you were able to ride a car skillfully. In addition, it can be used for marketing or asset management, and it is better to stop doing basic AI research that has been played in the media. After the introduction of AI, it is expected that banks will transfer manpower from the office department to the sales department. Employees who can understand the office process and have a sales sense are expected to have high sales performance. The way we work with AI is changing. Although AI-based office efficiency is being promoted, such as call centers, minutes, and document processing, it is unlikely that high performance will be achieved immediately if surplus office workers are assigned to sales managers. Changes in the way we work through the use of AI must be reviewed again and again. AI is strong in image analysis and voice analysis, but it is known that it is difficult to interpret the meaning of data.In fact, I think there has been a lot of movement to utilize machine learning from the point of view of supporting humans. I think it's important to build an appropriate model while being aware of how machine learning can be used to solve certain problems. Looking at the status of AI use by financial institutions, there are many cases where it is introduced as a way to improve the process of handling unstructured information. Specifically, voice recognition for customer inquiries and reading by a combination of AI and OCR in document input are used. As a result, follow-up work is digitized to increase efficiency.Specific services include chatbots (automatically writing FAQs through AI learning and adjusting language shake to deep learning), anti-money laundering, and credit card fraud detection. The use of AI in the footsteps is being carried out in areas where it is easy to generate ROI, such as cost reduction and manpower reduction. In addition, from the point of view of data utilization, it is responding with a single tool by setting up an AI specialized department under its jurisdiction including big data. When using a new technology such as AI, it is clear that the manager's own management philosophy is the first game, and that AI is used for what (work efficiency, improvement of labor productivity, environment where everyone can work happily, etc.) must not be determined Don't expect too much from AI."

Image segmentation is the most effective among thesemethods for recognizing objects within an image. Conventionally, image datasets of various classes are trainedsimultaneously. In situations where several classes require segmentation, all datasets have to be trainedthoroughly. Such repeated training results in low training efficiency because most of the classes have alreadybeen trained. In addition, the number of classes that appear in the datasets affects training. Some classes appearin datasets in remarkably smaller numbers than others, and hence, the training errors will not be properlyreflected when all the classes are trained simultaneously. Therefore, a new method that separates some classesfrom the dataset is proposed to improve efficiency during training.

A Study on Methodologies of Drug Repositioning Using Biomedical Big Data: A Focus on Diabetes Mellitus,2022,"['Drug repositioning', 'Semantics', 'Machine learning', 'Real-world data', 'Data science']",,"Drug repositioning is a strategy for identifying new applications of an existing drug that has been previously proven to be safe.Based on several examples of drug repositioning, we aimed to determine the methodologies and relevant steps associated with drugrepositioning that should be pursued in the future. Reports on drug repositioning, retrieved from PubMed from January 2011 to December 2020, were classified based on an analysis of the methodology and reviewed by experts. Among various drug repositioningmethods, the network-based approach was the most common (38.0%, 186/490 cases), followed by machine learning/deep learningbased (34.3%, 168/490 cases), text mining-based (7.1%, 35/490 cases), semantic-based (5.3%, 26/490 cases), and others (15.3%,75/490 cases). Although drug repositioning offers several advantages, its implementation is curtailed by the need for prior, conclusive clinical proof. This approach requires the construction of various databases, and a deep understanding of the process underlyingrepositioning is quintessential. An in-depth understanding of drug repositioning could reduce the time, cost, and risks inherent to early drug development, providing reliable scientific evidence. Furthermore, regarding patient safety, drug repurposing might allow thediscovery of new relationships between drugs and diseases."

For example, a part of the object may be occluded due to the presence of an object causing interference when acquiring an image of the object of interest. Even in the face classification of a person, if there is an occlusion such as a mask, there may be a problem that the accuracy is lowered when the classification is performed through the conventional trained model. To overcome this, we propose a pipeline that combines the GAN-based occlusion area restoration technique and the ArcFace Loss model, a machine learning algorithm based on the distance of the embedding vector, to increase the recognition accuracy of partially occluded faces. In this paper, the performance is evaluated based on the classification of a mask-wearing person, a representative example of an occluded face image. As a result, performance improvements of 68% and 0.62 were confirmed in Accuracy and F-1 Score, respectively, compared to conventional face learning."

AI가 발전하는 동안 예술에 이 기술을 적용해보자 하는 시도는 1970년대부터 시작해서 현재까지 이어지고 있다. 그 분야도 미술 뿐만 아니라 음악, 문학 등 다방면에서 시도되었다. AI-인간 협응 창작의 연구 대상으로 AI 벤자민에 의해 대본이 만들어진 <썬스프링(Sunspring)>을 분석한다. AI 벤자민의 대본은 의미를 읽어내기가 어려운 추상적이고 비논리적인 글이었다. 그러나, 인간 영화감독은 주어진 대본에 자신의 해석을 가미하여 무의미한 것처럼 보이는 대본을 유의미한 것으로 변환한다. 그리고 감독은 촬영, 편집, 각종 영상기법을 사용해서 무의식적인 파편의 말뭉치를 연속된 이미지로 이루어진 의식의 흐름으로 만든다. AI 벤자민은 RNN LSTM 모델의 인공신경망을 사용해서 <썬스프링>의 대본을 만들었다. 인공신경망은 뇌를 흉내내는 것에서 시작했지만, 인공신경망에 의한 머신러닝의 결과가 익숙한 것이 아니더라도 이를 통해 배울 수 있는 점이 있다. 그 낯설음은 오히려 내가 나의 편향성으로 인해 평소 간과하고 있던 무의미와 무의식의 영역으로부터 끌어 올려진 것이다. 의식과 무의식은 조이트로프나 영화처럼 단절성과 연속성이 공존한다. 의식은 흐름 속에서 발현될 수 있다.

In this paper, AI is not regarded as a tool or material but as a co-worker in which creative work is carried out jointly. First, I investigate the trends in AI projects for artistic creation. In the history of AI, attempts to apply this technology to art started in the 1970s and have continued to this day. AI has also been utilized in various areas such as music and literature as well as art. I analyze Sunspring, which was scripted by AI Benjamin, as a research subject for AI-human coordinated producing cinema. The script by the AI Benjamin was an abstract and incoherent text that was difficult to read. However, a human film director adds his own interpretation to the given script to make the seemingly meaningless script meaningful. The director uses filming, editing, and various video techniques to turn an unconscious, fragmented corpus into a continuous image stream of consciousness. AI Benjamin created the script for Sunspring using the artificial neural network of the RNN LSTM model. Although artificial neural networks started by mimicking the brain, there are aspects that can be learned from machine learning, even if we (humans) are not familiar with them. Instead, the unfamiliarity was lifted from the realm of meaninglessness and unconsciousness that had been usually overlooked due to bias. Consciousness and unconsciousness coexist with continuity and discontinuity, akin to a zoetrope or movie. Consciousness can emerge in the flow. Through the collaborative creation process between AI and humans, humans will have an opportunity to mirror their self-image on AI."

Cascaded-Hop For DeepFake Videos Detection,2022,"['Face manipulation', 'Deepfake detection', 'Machine learning', 'PixelHop++', 'SSL']",,"Face manipulation tools represented by Deepfake have threatened the security of people's biological identity information.

In this paper, for the sake of making high-quality Deepfake datasets, we provide a preprocessing method based on the image pixel matrix feature to eliminate similar images and the residual channel attention network (RCAN) to resize the scale of images. Significantly, we also describe a Deepfake detector named Cascaded-Hop which is based on the PixelHop++ system and the successive subspace learning (SSL) model. By feeding the preprocessed datasets, Cascaded-Hop achieves a good classification result on different manipulation types and multiple quality datasets.

A Study on the Generation of Datasets for Applied AI to OLED Life Prediction,2022,"['OLED', 'Dataset', 'Bigdata', 'AI', 'Machine learning']",,"OLED displays cannot be used permanently due to burn-in or generation of dark spots due to degradation. Therefore, the time when the display can operate normally is very important. It is close to impossible to physically measure the time when the display operates normally. Therefore, the time that works normally should be predicted in a way other than a physical way. Therefore, if you do computer simulations based on artificial intelligence, you can increase the accuracy of prediction by saving time and continuous learning. Therefore, if we do computer simulations based on artificial intelligence, we can increase the accuracy of prediction by saving time and continuous learning. In this paper, a dataset in the form of development from generation to diffusion of dark spots, which is one of the causes related to the life of OLED, was generated by applying the finite element method. The dark spots were generated in nine conditions, such as 0.1 to 2.0 μm with the size of pinholes, the number was 10 to 100, and 50% with water content. The learning data created in this way may be a criterion for generating an artificial intelligence-based dataset."
Cloud Removal Using Gaussian Process Regression for Optical Image Reconstruction,2022,"['Cloud removal', 'Image reconstruction', 'Machine learning', 'Gaussian process']",,"Cloud removal is often required to construct time-series sets of optical images for environmental monitoring. In regression-based cloud removal, the selection of an appropriate regression model and the impact analysis of the input images significantly affect the prediction performance. This study evaluates the potential of Gaussian process (GP) regression for cloud removal and also analyzes the effects of cloud-free optical images and spectral bands on prediction performance. Unlike other machine learning-based regression models, GP regression provides uncertainty information and automatically optimizes hyperparameters. An experiment using Sentinel-2 multi-spectral images was conducted for cloud removal in the two agricultural regions. The prediction performance of GP regression was compared with that of random forest (RF) regression. Various combinations of input images and multi-spectral bands were considered for quantitative evaluations. The experimental results showed that using multi-temporal images with multi-spectral bands as inputs achieved the best prediction accuracy. Highly correlated adjacent multi-spectral bands and temporally correlated multi-temporal images resulted in an improved prediction accuracy. The prediction performance of GP regression was significantly improved in predicting the near-infrared band compared to that of RF regression. Estimating the distribution function of input data in GP regression could reflect the variations in the considered spectral band with a broader range. In particular, GP regression was superior to RF regression for reproducing structural patterns at both sites in terms of structural similarity. In addition, uncertainty information provided by GP regression showed a reasonable similarity to prediction errors for some sub-areas, indicating that uncertainty estimates may be used to measure the prediction result quality. These findings suggest that GP regression could be beneficial for cloud removal and optical image reconstruction. In addition, the impact analysis results of the input images provide guidelines for selecting optimal images for regression-based cloud removal."

The distribution of abnormal node point air temperature produced by the fault at the control point of the economizer was reviewed. In addition, the relationship between OAT & mixed air temperature (MAT), OAT & outdoor air fraction (OAF), AHU cooling coil energy, and chiller energy were comparatively analyzed for each fault model. In the case of the fault models, although outdoor air suitable for cooling could be utilized during the operation, outdoor air was not introduced for cooling, and in the opposite case, outdoor air was introduced even when OAT was higher than the indoor set-point temperature, reducing the energy saving effect for cooling. In the future, we aim to analyze energy performance and indoor air quality according to the fault in the return air temperature (RAT) sensor and error in the opening position of the damper. In addition, we plan to continue the analysis of fault data for the various elements of an AHU, and develop FDD algorithms using machine learning."

A stratified sampling methodology with open-ended survey questions is used as a primary source of data for a sample size of 1019 for both international and domestic tourists. The data collected through a survey is processed using a data mining tool to perform multi-dimensional analysis to discover information patterns and visualize clusters. Further, supervised machine learning algorithms, kNN, Decision tree, Support vector machine, Random forest, Neural network, Naïve Bayes, and Gradient boost are used to develop models for training and prediction purposes for the survey data. To find the best model for prediction purposes, different performance matrices are used to evaluate a model for performance, accuracy, and robustness. The best model is used in constructing a learning-enabled model for predicting tourists as satisfied, neutral, and unsatisfied visitors. This work is very important for tourism business personnel, government agencies, and tourism stakeholders to find information on tourist satisfaction and factors that influence it.

Applicability of hypotension prediction index to surgical patients,2022,"['Anesthesia', 'Forecasting', 'Hypotension', 'Intraoperative monitoring', 'Machine learning']",,"Intraoperative hypotension, which frequently occurs during surgery, can lead to unfavorable results. However, general blood pressure monitoring has limitations in continuously detecting hypotension in a patient, and there is a risk of not recognizing the presence of hypotension. Even short-term hypotension can damage major organs. The hypotension prediction index (HPI) indicates the likelihood that a patient will develop hypotension within the next 5 to 15 minutes in a hemodynamically stable state without hypotension. The HPI algorithm was developed to calculate the probability of hypotension using a machine-learning algorithm to characterize continuous arterial pressure waveforms in 1,334 surgical and critically ill patients. HPI provides parameters for determining the cause of hypotension (preload, contractility, or afterload), such as stroke volume variability, dP/dtmax, and dynamic arterial elastance. Although there is still no standard protocol for preventing or treating hypotension using HPI values, predicting the risk continuously and the cause of hypotension during surgery in real-time may help prevent harmful hypotension during surgery. In this review, we introduce the concept of HPI and discuss whether it can be applied in actual clinical practice."

First, the data collection criteria were suggested and a total of 2,024 datasets were prepared. And they were randomly classified into 1,417 learning data and 607 evaluation data. After that, the size and quality of the training data set were improved using data augmentation techniques to increase the performance of deep learning. The CNN-based algorithms used in this study were VGGNet-16, VGGNet-19, ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121. The evaluation of the defect classification performance was made by comparing the accuracy, loss, and learning speed using verification data. The DenseNet-121 algorithm showed better performance than other algorithms with an accuracy of 99.13% and a loss value of 0.037. This was due to the structural characteristics of the DenseNet model, and the information loss was reduced by acquiring information from all previous layers for image identification in this algorithm. Based on the above results, the possibility of machine vision application of CNN-based model for the surface defect classification of Al extruded materials was also discussed."
Histopathologic and Molecular Biomarkers of PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitor Treatment Response among Patients with Microsatellite Instability‒High Colon Cancer,2022,"['Microsatellite instability', 'Colonic neoplasms', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitors', 'Biomarker', 'Transcriptome profiles', 'Histology', 'Machine learning']",,"Purpose Recent clinical trials have reported response rates < 50% among patients treated with programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors for microsatellite instability‒high (MSI-H) colorectal cancer (CRC), and factors predicting treatment response have not been fully identified. This study aimed to identify potential biomarkers of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment response among patients with MSI-H CRC. Materials and Methods MSI-H CRC patients enrolled in three clinical trials of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade at Asan Medical Center (Seoul, Republic of Korea) were screened and classified into two groups according to treatment response. Their histopathologic features and expression of 730 immune-related genes from the NanoString platform were evaluated, and a machine learning–based classification model was built to predict treatment response among MSI-H CRCs patients.Results A total of 27 patients (15 responders, 12 non-responders) were included. A high degree of lymphocytic/neutrophilic infiltration and an expansile tumor border were associated with treatment response and prolonged progression-free survival (PFS), while mucinous/signet-ring cell carcinoma was associated with a lack of treatment response and short PFS. Gene expression profiles revealed that the interferon-γ response pathway was enriched in the responder group. Of the top eight differentially expressed immune-related genes, <i>PRAME</i> had the highest fold change in the responder group. Higher expression of <i>PRAME</i> was independently associated with better PFS along with histologic subtypes in the multivariate analysis. The classification model using these genes showed good performance for predicting treatment response.Conclusion We identified histologic and immune-related gene expression characteristics associated with treatment response in MSI-H CRC, which may contribute to optimal patient stratification."

Then, an artificial neural network is constructed to generalize the correction term with relevant flow features. This study shows that the corrected SA model reduces the turbulence production near the separation point, which leads to the improved prediction of the stalled airfoil at high angles of attack.

In this research, conventional machine learning algorithms are analyzed to classify the data as either non-rumor data or rumor data. Machine learning techniques have limited tuning capability and make decisions based on their learning. To tackle this problem the authors propose a deep learning-based Rumor Detection Neural Network model to predict the rumor tweet in real-world events. This model comprises three layers, AttCNN layer is used to extract local and position invariant features from the data, AttBi-LSTM layer to extract important semantic or contextual information and HPOOL to combine the down sampling patches of the input feature maps from the average and maximum pooling layers. A dataset from Kaggle and ground dataset #gaja are used to train the proposed Rumor Detection Neural Network to determine the veracity of the rumor.

Larger ships lead to increased travel time for ship workers, increased work intensity, and reduced work efficiency. Problems such as increased work intensity are reducing the influx of young people into labor, along with the phenomenon of avoidance of high intensity labor by the younger generation. In addition, the rapid aging of the population and decrease in the young labor force aggravate the labor shortage problem in the maritime industry. To overcome this, the maritime industry has recently introduced technologies such as an intelligent production design platform and a smart production operation management system, and a smart autonomous logistics system in one of these technologies. The smart autonomous logistics system is a technology that delivers various goods using intelligent mobile robots, and enables the robot to drive itself by using sensors such as lidar and camera. Therefore, in this paper, it was checked whether the mobile robot could autonomously drive to the stop sign by detecting the passage way of the ship deck. The autonomous driving was performed by detecting the passage way of the ship deck through the camera mounted on the mobile robot based on the data learned through Nvidia’s End-to-end learning. The mobile robot was stopped by checking the stop sign using SSD MobileNetV2. The experiment was repeated five times in which the mobile robot autonomously drives to the stop sign without deviation from the ship deck passage way at a distance of about 70m. As a result of the experiment, it was confirmed that the mobile robot was driven without deviation from passage way. If the smart autonomous logistics system to which this result is applied is used in the marine industry, it is thought that the stability, reduction of labor force, and work efficiency will be improved when workers work."

Second, in the correlation analysis of GOT and the Basic Interest Scale (BIS), it was analyzed that among the BIS scales of R and R, the mechanical field had the highest correlation (0.963). This results suggest that students have a very high interest in jobs and activities that work with machines. Third, in the analysis of GET and academic achievement, as mentioned in the previous study, the field type was analyzed as having the lowest academic achievement, and there was no significant difference in learning level for each type.

Focusing on the Korean automobile market, we collect 346,795 news articles related to the automobile industry. Then, we employ a machine learning-based text mini ng model to extract the semantic structure of brands and brand attributes reflected in the news text data. Specifically, we utilize the Word2vec model to assign each word as a vector, and measure the semantic (dis)similarity as the vector distance between word vectors. This approach enables us to find key brand attributes in the Korean automobile market, such as “quality”, “luxury”, and “trust”, and to measure the strength of their associations with automobile brands. Using the associations between brand and brand attributes, we visualize the brand-level market structure via perceptual maps that reveal the competitive nature of the market at the brand level. Based on these results, we summarize meaningful insights for the brand management and marketing strategy."
Classification of Midinfrared Spectra of Colon Cancer Tissue Using a Convolutional Neural Network,2022,"['Convolution neural network', 'Hyperspectral imaging', 'Mid-infrared']",,"The development of midinfrared (mid-IR) quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) has enabled rapid highcontrast measurement of the mid-IR spectra of biological tissues. Several studies have compared the differences between the mid-IR spectra of colon cancer and noncancerous colon tissues. Most midIR spectrum classification studies have been proposed as machine-learning-based algorithms, but this results in deviations depending on the initial data and threshold values. We aim to develop a process for classifying colon cancer and noncancerous colon tissues through a deep-learning-based convolutionalneural-network (CNN) model. First, we image the midinfrared spectrum for the CNN model, an imagebased deep-learning (DL) algorithm. Then, it is trained with the CNN algorithm and the classification ratio is evaluated using the test data. When the tissue microarray (TMA) and routine pathological slide are tested, the ML-based support-vector-machine (SVM) model produces biased results, whereas we confirm that the CNN model classifies colon cancer and noncancerous colon tissues. These results demonstrate that the CNN model using midinfrared-spectrum images is effective at classifying colon cancer tissue and noncancerous colon tissue, and not only submillimeter-sized TMA but also routine colon cancer tissue samples a few tens of millimeters in size."

Therefore, it can be used as a powerful tool for effective estimation, and shows higher estimation accuracy through several previous studies. Measurement of various physical fitness-related factors in the field of sports medicine requires a lot of cost, time, expensive equipment, and effort of the subject.

Failure Mode Detection of Reinforced Concrete Shear Walls Using Ensemble Deep Neural Networks,2022,"['deep neural network', 'failure mode', 'shear wall', 'classification']",,"Reinforced concrete structural walls (RCSWs) are one of the most efficient lateral force-resisting systems used in buildings, providing sufficient strength, stiffness, and deformation capacities to withstand the forces generated during earthquake ground motions. Identifying the failure mode of the RCSWs is a critical task that can assist engineers and designers in choosing appropriate retrofitting solutions. This study evaluates the efficiency of three ensemble deep neural network models, including the model averaging ensemble, weighted average ensemble, and integrated stacking ensemble for predicting the failure mode of the RCSWs. The ensemble deep neural network models are compared against previous studies that used traditional well-known ensemble models (AdaBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) and traditional machine learning methods (Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest). The weighted average ensemble model is proposed as the best-suited prediction model for identifying the failure mode since it has the highest accuracy, precision, and recall among the alternative models. In addition, since complex and advanced machine learning-based models are commonly referred to as black-box, the SHapley Additive exPlanation method is also used to interpret the model workflow and illustrate the importance and contribution of the components that impact determining the failure mode of the RCSWs."

Thus, adversarial examples facilitate assessing whether and how a specific deep learning architecture (e.g., a language model) robustly works. Out of the multiple layers of linguistic structures, this study lays focus on a morphosyntactic phenomenon in Korean, namely, case alternation. We created a set of adversarial examples regarding case alternation, and then tested the morpho-syntactic ability of neural language models. We extracted the instances of case alternation from the Sejong Electronic Dictionary, and made use of mBERT and KR-BERT as the language models. The results (measured by means of surprisal) indicate that the language models are unexpectedly good at discerning case alternation in Korean. In addition, it turns out that the Korean-specific language model performs better than the multilingual model. These imply that an in-depth knowledge of linguistics is essential for creating adversarial examples in Korean."

However, studies related to performance comparison between RNN based models are insufficient; although the model performance had possibility for improvement through optimization. Therefore, in this study the RNN, long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU) models were developed to predict the number of occupants after 15, 30, and 60 minutes. The optimal models for each prediction horizon were derived through optimization and performance evaluation. As a result, the GRU model presented the best performance. The root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of the prediction model after 15 minutes was 0.8073, 1.5301, the prediction model after 30 minutes was 1.2841, 2.3386, and 2.0769, 3.3685, for the prediction model after 60 minutes. These results show superior performance compared to the existing RNN based models and signify that it is possible to provide accurate values for various prediction horizons. Thus, if outlier supplementation and addition of the adaptation function are implemented through an algorithm in the future, the developed models are expected to be utilized as a key element for OCC."

In particular, new types of frauds such as full repaying of existing loans, unpaid rehabilitation, and first-time delinquency distort creditworthiness reduce the possibility of loans to normal loan users and cause enormous damage to investors. However, it is difficult to detect with the existing machine learning-based models due to very few fraud samples and low similarity between fraud samples. In this study, we focus on the fact that the target frauds are very few, which account only for 0.1% of the total datasets. Our study is the first research effort for a fraud detection methodology using semi-supervised anomaly detection methodology that uses labeled fraud samples and unlabeled potential fraud samples. In the study, we use Recall-BEP as an evaluation metric focusing more on accurately detecting frauds than on accurately classifying normal samples. Through the experiments, we show that the proposed semi-supervised based fraud detection methodology outperforms the existing comparison model based on the supervised learning. In particular, DevNet improves Recall-BEP by 17.39% compared to the comparison model.

In this work, we assessed status-quo performance of the Yongdam Dam in Korea under various climatic stresses in flood risk reduction and water supply reliability for 2021-2040. To this end, we employed a decision-centric framework equipped with a stochastic weather generator, a conceptual streamflow model, and a machine-learning reservoir operation rule. By imposing 294 climate perturbations to dam release simulations, we found that the current operation rule of the Yongdam dam could redundantly secure water storage, while inefficiently enhancing the supply reliability. On the other hand, flood risks were likely to increase substantially due to rising mean and variability of daily precipitation. Here, we argue that the current operation rules of the Yongdam Dam seem to be overly focused on securing water storage, and thus need to be adjusted to efficiently improve supply reliability and reduce flood risks in downstream areas."

However, post-harvest losses due to pulse beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus (F.), are significant due to improper storage management practices and undetected internal infestations.The detection of early stages of infestation could help in implementing suitable control practices for insect disinfestation.This study determined the potential of detecting internal infestations caused by C. maculatus using the soft X-ray method and deep learning. Furthermore, this study aims to reduce the time and effort needed to prepare a huge amount of image data for this highly data-driven process by using generative adversarial networks (GANs).Methods A three-class classification method was implemented to identify the infestation stages, namely, uninfested kernel, larva stage, and pupa stage. The approach was based on features extraction from the deepest pooling layer of a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network architecture—the Xception, and using support vector machine as the classifier. Moreover, a GAN model was proposed to synthesize artificial X-ray images.Results The overall F1-score produced by the model was improved from 0.86 to 0.91 when the GAN-synthesized dataset additionally supported the training data. Also, the classification accuracy for detecting the stage of internal infestation improved by 5.5%.Conclusion The experiment showed that X-ray imaging and deep learning–based automatic features extraction could identify internal infestation in green gram grains.

However, an autonomous machine without moral guarantees is nothing more than a “terminator.” For Terminator, the status of artificial intelligence as a moral agent is not recognized. The status of an agent is conferred only on beings acting morally.  With this dystopia in mind, we will first examine the possible conditions for imparting morality to AI (Ch. 2). This is the concept of ‘electronic personality’. The electronic personality is established based on the autonomy of AI. On the other hand, increased autonomy leads to improved morality within AI systems. Accordingly, we will consider the ‘complementary’ relationship between autonomy and morality (Ch. 3). The maximization of autonomy and morality of AI will eventually go beyond ‘anthropocentrism’, but the key here is to make moral decisions made by AI the same as human decisions (Ch. 4). This is possible by allowing AI to “learn” moral accountability. In this way, we believe that harmony between artificial intelligence and human life can also be achieved."

Among artificial intelligence techniques, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which are commonly used for time series data, only estimate in the direction of time flow or in the reverse direction to the missing estimation position, so the estimation performance is poor in the long-term missing section. On the other hand, in this study, estimation performance can be improved even for long-term missing data by estimating in both directions before and after the missing section. Also, by using all available data around the observation point (sea surface temperature, temperature, wind field, atmospheric pressure, humidity), the imputation performance was further improved by estimating the imputation data from these correlations together. For performance verification, a statistical model, Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), a machine learning-based Random Forest model, and an RNN model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) were compared. For imputation of long-term missing for 7 days, the average accuracy of the BiRNN/ statistical models is 70.8%/61.2%, respectively, and the average error is 0.28 degrees/0.44 degrees, respectively, so the BiRNN model performs better than other models. By applying a temporal decay factor representing the missing pattern, it is judged that the BiRNN technique has better imputation performance than the existing method as the missing section becomes longer."

Focusing on the nature of literature that explores the nature of humanity as a humanities subject, I reinterpreted Kim So-wol’s three poems, which were mainly published in “Literature” textbooks and are related to folk tales dealing with long-standing human problems.In the case of 〈SanYuHwa〉, Kim So-wol’s 〈SanYuHwa〉 was reinterpreted based on the history of literary expropriation from the 17th to the 20th centuries, which was re-created by accepting the folk song 〈SanYuHwa〉 sung by Hyang-rang in the Hyang-rang folk tale. In the four stanzas, it was noted that the third stanza serves as a precursor to the structure of four-line hansi (Chinese classical poetry, Jeol-gu) and brings important changes to the image. Furthermore, the existence of this small bird is the same as the role of a girl in the Hyangrang folk tale, and through this, 〈SanYuHwa〉 is interpreted as a poem that tells us that we remember and pass their stories on to the dead.In the case of 〈ChoHon〉, it is pointed out that the acceptance of Becoming a Stone folk tale plays an important role in acquiring the universality of this poem, and the human imagination and willingness to overcome tragedy by becoming a stone in front of the pain of parting and the solitude of the dead are examined. Through this, it is deemed that it is a poem showing the nature of human minds and thoughts, and that the attributes of literature in other areas of emotion and reason become the driving force of human civilization.In the case of 〈JeopDongSae〉, we saw that it was our job and the role of literature to remember and convey the dead in sorrow without merely passing through the unjust death. Moreover, the need to approach the sadness in the poem from the perspective of greater universality than from the perspective of limiting it to the unique Han (恨) of Korean people, and from the perspective of understanding human society as a present story was suggested.Through this, the tradition of Kim So-wol’s poems, which are habitually told, have a literary history meaning based on the closeness of form and content by organically explaining how folk tales play an important role regarding content, rather than the acceptance of simple form or similarity between narratives. Additionally, we could learn how to live today without fear as small, young, and unnamed ordinary persons in the face of war and plague, unfair events and accidents, and in an artificial intelligence and machine-centered society."

However, designing supports at the early stage of tunnel design, such as feasibility study or basic design, may be very challenging due to the short timeline, insufficient budget, and deficiency of field data. Meanwhile, the design of the support pattern can be performed more quickly and reliably by utilizing the machine learning technique and the accumulated design data with the rapid increase in tunnel construction in South Korea. Therefore, in this study, the design data and ground exploration data of 48 road tunnels in South Korea were inspected, and data about 19 items, including eight input items (rock type, resistivity, depth, tunnel length, safety index by tunnel length, safety index by rick index, tunnel type, tunnel area) and 11 output items (rock mass grade, two items for shotcrete, three items for rock bolt, three items for steel support, two items for concrete lining), were collected to automatically determine the rock mass class and the support pattern. Three machine learning models (S1, A1, A2) were developed using two machine learning algorithms (SVR, ANN) and organized data. As a result, the A2 model, which applied different loss functions according to the output data format, showed the best performance. This study confirms the potential of support pattern design using machine learning, and it is expected that it will be able to improve the design model by continuously using the model in the actual design, compensating for its shortcomings, and improving its usability."

The present study aimed at exploring the feasibility of the automated scoring in a writing test of Korean language. To this end, a scoring model was constructed and score prediction was performed by utilizing machine learning based on writing responses and their scoring data from the pesudo-test of Sejong Korean language Assessment (SKA). Random Forest, one of the representative supervised learning algorithms, was used for this machine learning, and the performance of the scoring model was validated in terms of ‘Accuracy,’ ‘Precision,’ ‘Recall,’ ‘F1,’ and ‘Kappa’ values. As a result, the performance of the scoring model in the two scoring domains of 'language use' and 'content' was good even though the data size for machine learning in this study was very small and the scoring rubric was not customized for the SKA writing test items. This results showed very positive implications for applying an automated scoring to the SKA writing test. In particular, the correlation between scores predicted by the automated scoring model and given by the human rater was smaller than that between scores by two human raters, however, the difference of the two groups was just about .10, which might be overcome by using a larger amount of data for machine learning and customizing automated scoring features.(Inha University, Gwangju University of Education, King Sejong Institute Foundation)"
韩语多义动词的汉语翻译情况考察,2022,"['神经网络机器翻译(neural machine translation)', '多义动词 (polysemous verb)', '同音异义动词(homonymous verb)', '韩中翻译(Korean-Chinese translation)', '错误分析(error analysis)']",,"Learning polysemy is one of the difficult parts for learners studying foreign languages. This is because the meaning of polysemy with more than one expressed meaning is deeply related to the culture of the society and the cognitive method of the members of the society influenced by the culture. In the case of translation, the meaning may vary depending on the accurate translation of polysemy, or the exact transmission may not be possible. Thus, learners must also invest a lot of effort into learning polysemy when learning a foreign language.Therefore, this paper examines whether Korean Chinese learners can correctly translate sentences using a Korean polysemous verb, and the ability to process polysemous verb translation of neural network machine translation when they translate Korean polysemous verbs into Chinese. Thus, this paper is a follow-up study of the Korean-Chinese machine translation pattern of a homonymous verb conducted as a previous study. By examining the machine translation pattern of a polysemous verb, it can be confirmed that Google still shows low accuracy while Papago and Baidu have improved translation accuracy in the translation of polysemy.In addition, Papago and Baidu have much better translation skills than middle-class Chinese-level college students who participated in this study in the translation of a polysemous verb and a homonymous verb. Thus, students will be able to use the neural network translation system as useful learning tools to help modify the translation on their own in the future."

With the joint advancement of machine learning and artificial intelligence, Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) artificial intelligence models have been utilized in education. The key of DKT is to monitor and estimate students’ evolving knowledge state, accurately predict their future performance on future exercises, and ultimately maximize learning efficiency. The current study developed a DKT model with a new parameter, spacing effect, in order to increase the accuracy of the model.

분리학습 모델을 이용한 수출액 예측 및 수출 유망국가 추천,2022,"['수출액 예측', '머신러닝', '분리학습', 'Exports prediction', 'Machine learning', 'Separated learning', 'LightGBM', 'SHapley value']",,"One of the characteristics of South Korea’s economic structure is that it is highly dependent on exports. Thus, many businesses are closely related to the global economy and diplomatic situation. In addition, small and medium-sized enterprises(SMEs) specialized in exporting are struggling due to the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a model to forecast exports for next year to support SMEs export strategy and decision making. Also, this study proposed a strategy to recommend promising export countries of each item based on the forecasting model.  We analyzed important variables used in previous studies such as country-specific, item-specific, and macro-economic variables and collected those variables to train our prediction model. Next, through the exploratory data analysis(EDA) it was found that exports, which is a target variable, have a highly skewed distribution. To deal with this issue and improve predictive performance, we suggest a separated learning method. In a separated learning method, the whole dataset is divided into homogeneous subgroups and a prediction algorithm is applied to each group. Thus, characteristics of each group can be more precisely trained using different input variables and algorithms. In this study, we divided the dataset into five subgroups based on the exports to decrease skewness of the target variable. After the separation, we found that each group has different characteristics in countries and goods. For example, In Group 1, most of the exporting countries are developing countries and the majority of exporting goods are low value products such as glass and prints. On the other hand, major exporting countries of South Korea such as China, USA, and Vietnam are included in Group 4 and Group 5 and most exporting goods in these groups are high value products.  Then we used LightGBM(LGBM) and Exponential Moving Average(EMA) for prediction. Considering the characteristics of each group, models were built using LGBM for Group 1 to 4 and EMA for Group 5. To evaluate the performance of the model, we compare different model structures and algorithms. As a result, it was found that the separated learning model had best performance compared to other models. After the model was built, we also provided variable importance of each group using SHAP-value to add explainability of our model.  Based on the prediction model, we proposed a second-stage recommendation strategy for potential export countries. In the first phase, BCG matrix was used to find Star and Question Mark markets that are expected to grow rapidly. In the second phase, we calculated scores for each country and recommendations were made according to ranking. Using this recommendation framework, potential export countries were selected and information about those countries for each item was presented.  There are several implications of this study. First of all, most of the preceding studies have conducted research on the specific situation or country. However, this study use various variables and develops a machine learning model for a wide range of countries and items. Second, as to our knowledge, it is the first attempt to adopt a separated learning method for exports prediction. By separating the dataset into 5 homogeneous subgroups, we could enhance the predictive performance of the model. Also, more detailed explanation of models by group is provided using SHAP values.  Lastly, this study has several practical implications. There are some platforms which serve trade information including KOTRA, but most of them are based on past data. Therefore, it is not easy for companies to predict future trends. By utilizing the model and recommendation strategy in this research, trade related services in each platform can be improved so that companies including SMEs can fully utilize the service when making strategies and decisions for exports."

Research on Forecasting Framework for System Marginal Price based on Deep Recurrent Neural Networks and Statistical Analysis Models,2022,"['Electricity price forecasting', 'Machine learning', 'Deep learning', 'Optimal model selection', 'Energy management systems']",,"Electricity has become a factor that dramatically affects the market economy. The day-ahead system marginal price determines electricity prices, and system marginal price forecasting is critical in maintaining energy management systems. There have been several studies using mathematics and machine learning models to forecast the system marginal price, but few studies have been conducted to develop, compare, and analyze various machine learning and deep learning models based on a data-driven framework. Therefore, in this study, different machine learning algorithms (i.e., autoregressive-based models such as the autoregressive integrated moving average model) and deep learning networks (i.e., recurrent neural network-based models such as the long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit model) are considered and integrated evaluation metrics including a forecasting test and information criteria are proposed to discern the optimal forecasting model. A case study of South Korea using long-term time-series system marginal price data from 2016 to 2021 was applied to the developed framework. The results of the study indicate that the autoregressive integrated moving average model (R-squared score: 0.97) and the gated recurrent unit model (R-squared score: 0.94) are appropriate for system marginal price forecasting. This study is expected to contribute significantly to energy management systems and the suggested framework can be explicitly applied for renewable energy networks."

Insider threats have emerged as a major issue, with cases in which corporate insiders attempting to leak confidential data by accessing it remotely. In response, insider threat detection approaches based on machine learning have been developed. However, existing machine learning methods used to detect insider threats do not take biases and variances into account, which leads to limited performance. In this paper, boosting-type ensemble learning algorithms are applied to verify the performance of malicious insider detection, conduct a close analysis, and even consider the imbalance in datasets to determine the final result. Through experiments, we show that using ensemble learning achieves similar or higher accuracy to other existing malicious insider detection approaches while considering bias-variance tradeoff. The experimental results show that ensemble learning using bagging and boosting methods reached an accuracy of over 98%, which improves malicious insider detection performance by 5.62% compared to the average accuracy of single learning models used."

According to population and housing census, Gunsan-si has continuously shown increasing trend of vacant houses during 2015 to 2019. In particular, since Gunsan-si is the city which suffers from doughnut effect and industrial decline, problems regrading to vacant house seems to exacerbate.This study aims to provide a foundation of a system which can predict and deal with the building that has high risk of becoming vacant house through implementing a data driven vacant house prediction machine learning model. Methodologically, this study analyzes three types of machine learning model by differing the data components. First model is trained based on building register, individual declared land value, house price and socioeconomic data and second model is trained with the same data as first model but with additional POI(Point of Interest) data. Finally, third model is trained with same data as the second model but with excluding water usage and electricity usage data.As a result, second model shows the best performance based on F1-score. Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine, XGBoost and LightGBM which are tree ensemble series, show the best performance as a whole. Additionally, the complexity of the model can be reduced through eliminating independent variables that have correlation coefficient between the variables and vacant house status lower than the 0.1 based on absolute value. Finally, this study suggests XGBoost and LightGBM based machine learning model, which can handle missing values, as final vacant house prediction model."

But despite this wealth of knowledge, health problems related to nutrition continue to increase. This leads us to postulate that the continuing trend may result from a lack of consideration for intra-individual biological variation on dietary responses. Precision nutrition utilizes personal information such as age, gender, lifestyle, diet intake, environmental exposure, genetic variants, microbiome, and epigenetics to provide better dietary advices and interventions. Recent technological advances in the artificial intelligence, big data analytics, cloud computing, and machine learning, have made it possible to process data on a scale and in ways that were previously impossible. A big data platform is built by collecting numerous parameters such as meal features, medical metadata, lifestyle variation, genome diversity and microbiome composition. Sophisticated techniques based on machine learning algorithm can be used to integrate and interpret multiple factors and provide dietary guidance at a personalized or stratified level. The development of a suitable machine learning algorithm would make it possible to suggest a personalized diet or functional food based on analysis of intra-individual metabolic variation.This novel precision nutrition might become one of the most exciting and promising approaches of improving health conditions, especially in the context of non-communicable disease prevention."

CCTV 동영상과 IR 센서 기반 강설 및 결빙 상태 감지 기술,2022,"['Road safety', 'smart monitoring', 'snow removal', 'black-ice detection', 'machine learning', 'deep learning', 'convolutional neural networks']",,"PURPOSES : Road surface conditions are vital to traffic safety, management, and operation. To ensure traffic operation and safety during periods of snow and ice during the winter, each local government allocates considerable resources for monitoring that rely on field-oriented manual work. Therefore, a smart monitoring and management system for autonomous snow removal that can rapidly respond to unexpected abrupt heavy snow and black ice in winter must be developed. This study addresses a smart technology for automatically monitoring and detecting road surface conditions in an experimental environment using convolutional neural networks based on a CCTV camera and infrared (IR) sensor data. METHODS : The proposed approach comprises three steps: obtaining CCTV videos and IR sensor data, processing the dataset acquired to apply deep learning based on convolutional neural networks, and training the learning model and validating it. The first step involves a large dataset comprising 12,626 images extracted from the acquired CCTV videos and the synchronized surface temperature data from the IR sensor. In the second step, image frames are extracted from the videos, and only foreground target images are extracted during preprocessing. Hence, only the area (each image measuring 500 × 500) of the asphalt road surface corresponding to the road surface is applied to construct an ideal dataset. In addition, the IR thermometer sensor data stored in the logger are used to calculate the road surface temperatures corresponding to the image acquisition time. The images are classified into three categories, i.e., normal, snow, and black-ice, to construct a training dataset. Under normal conditions, the images include dry and wet road conditions. In the final step, the learning process is conducted using the acquired dataset for deep learning and verification. The dataset contains 10,100 (80%) data points for deep learning and 2,526 (20%) points for verification. RESULTS : To evaluate the proposed approach, the loss, accuracy, and confusion matrix of the addressed model are calculated. The model loss refers to the loss caused by the estimated error of the model, where 0.0479 and 0.0401 are indicated in the learning and verification stages, respectively. Meanwhile, the accuracies are 97.82% and 98.00%, respectively. Based on various tests that involve adjusting the learning parameters, an optimized model is derived by generalizing the characteristics of the input image, and errors such as overfitting are resolved. This experiment shows that this approach can be used for snow and black-ice detections on roads. CONCLUSIONS : The approach introduced herein is feasible in road environments, such as actual tunnel entrances. It does not necessitate expensive imported equipment, as general CCTV cameras can be applied to general roads, and low-cost IR temperature sensors can be used to provide efficiency and high accuracy in road sections such as national roads and highways. It is envisaged that the developed system will be applied to in situ conditions on roads."

미국 프로농구(NBA)의 플레이오프 진출에 영향을 미치는 주요 변수 예측: 3점과 턴오버 속성을 중심으로,2022,"['미국 프로농구 플레이오프 분석', '기계학습', '통계적 분석', '샤플리', '특성 중요도', 'NBA Playoffs analysis', 'Machine learning', 'Statistical analysis', 'SHAP', 'Feature importance']",,"This study acquires NBA statistical information for a total of 32 years from 1990 to 2022 using web crawling, observes variables of interest through exploratory data analysis, and generates related derived variables. Unused variables were removed through a purification process on the input data, and correlation analysis, t-test, and ANOVA were performed on the remaining variables. For the variable of interest, the difference in the mean between the groups that advanced to the playoffs and did not advance to the playoffs was tested, and then to compensate for this, the average difference between the three groups (higher/middle/lower) based on ranking was reconfirmed. Of the input data, only this years season data was used as a test set, and 5-fold cross-validation was performed by dividing the training set and the validation set for model training. The overfitting problem was solved by comparing the cross-validation result and the final analysis result using the test set to confirm that there was no difference in the performance matrix. Because the quality level of the raw data is high and the statistical assumptions are satisfied, most of the models showed good results despite the small data set. This study not only predicts NBA game results or classifies whether or not to advance to the playoffs using machine learning, but also examines whether the variables of interest are included in the major variables with high importance by understanding the importance of input attribute. Through the visualization of SHAP value, it was possible to overcome the limitation that could not be interpreted only with the result of feature importance, and to compensate for the lack of consistency in the importance calculation in the process of entering/removing variables. It was found that a number of variables related to three points and errors classified as subjects of interest in this study were included in the major variables affecting advancing to the playoffs in the NBA. Although this study is similar in that it includes topics such as match results, playoffs, and championship predictions, which have been dealt with in the existing sports data analysis field, and comparatively analyzed several machine learning models for analysis, there is a difference in that the interest features are set in advance and statistically verified, so that it is compared with the machine learning analysis result. Also, it was differentiated from existing studies by presenting explanatory visualization results using SHAP, one of the XAI models."

An Approach to Applying Multiple Linear Regression Models by Interlacing Data in Classifying Similar Software,2022,"['Machine Learning', 'Linear Regression', 'Similar Software Classification', 'Software Analysis']",,"The development of information technology is bringing many changes to everyday life, and machine learningcan be used as a technique to solve a wide range of real-world problems. Analysis and utilization of data areessential processes in applying machine learning to real-world problems. As a method of processing data inmachine learning, we propose an approach based on applying multiple linear regression models by interlacingdata to the task of classifying similar software. Linear regression is widely used in estimation problems to modelthe relationship between input and output data. In our approach, multiple linear regression models are generatedby training on interlaced feature data. A combination of these multiple models is then used as the predictionmodel for classifying similar software. Experiments are performed to evaluate the proposed approach ascompared to conventional linear regression, and the experimental results show that the proposed methodclassifies similar software more accurately than the conventional model. We anticipate the proposed approachto be applied to various kinds of classification problems to improve the accuracy of conventional linearregression."

Moreover, there are required lightweight methods for handling real-time Internet of Things (IoT) communication perspectives, especially for ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) and optimal resource utilization. To overcome the abovementioned issues, this paper proposed an intelligent scheme for traffic steering based on the integration of MEC and lightweight ML, namely support vector machine (SVM) for effectively routing for lightweight and resource constraint networks. The scheme provides dynamic resource handling for the real-time IoT user systems based on the awareness of obvious network statues. The system evaluations were conducted by utillizing computer software simulations, and the proposed approach is remarkably outperformed the conventional schemes in terms of significant QoS metrics, including communication latency, reliability, and communication throughput."

To forecast the transient response three machine learning (ML) meta-models based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs); specifically, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and a sequence combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and LSTM are developed. The chosen accident scenario is a control element assembly withdrawal at power concurrent with the Loss Of Offsite Power (LOOP). The transient response was obtained using the best estimate thermal hydraulics code, MARS-KS, and cross-validated against the Design and control document (DCD). DAKOTA software is loosely coupled with MARS-KS code via a python interface to perform the Best Estimate Plus Uncertainty Quantification (BEPU) analysis and generate a time series database of the system response to train, test and validate the ML meta-models. Key uncertain parameters identified as required by the CASU methodology were propagated using the non-parametric Monte-Carlo (MC) random propagation and Latin Hypercube Sampling technique until a statistically significant database (181 samples) as required by Wilk's fifth order is achieved with 95% probability and 95% confidence level.

Then, the predictive performance of the two models was compared. The analysis was performed independently for the case of using all the data at once and for the case by classifying the data with a criterion related to the occurrence of wave breaking.

Therefore, examining which factor, problem type or student characteristic, has a relatively higher impact on learner’s disengagement is important in terms of helping researchers understand which of the two variables they should focus more to prevent disengagement effectively. Previous studies have compared problem type and student characteristics in school-aged children using the Intelligent Tutoring Systems(ITS); however, there have been few studies examining pre-school educational games. Therefore, this study examined the problem type or student characteristics variables in the context of educational games that could better explain the three types of disengagement: gaming, off-task, and quit. Gaming is a behavior when learners attempt to solve problems by exploiting the system ’s properties rather than thinking deeply. Off-task refers to when students disengage in learning tasks, and quitting is a behavior where students give up during problem-solving activity. To identify the variable that better explains the three types of disengagement, four analyses were conducted: linear regression, self-correlation analysis, histogram, and Bayesian network. The analyses were performed using 15,066 of logged data from 409 learners who played KitkitSchool, a preschool educational game application. As a result, in all four analyses, it was found that the problem type better explained the three disengagements compared to the learner characteristics. Therefore, it is necessary to further explore problem types to more fully understand the three disengagement types in educational games."

Cross validation methods: analysis based on diagnostics of thyroid cancer metastasis,2022,"['Machine learning', 'Model validation', 'Monte Carlo validation', 'Cross validation', 'LOOCV', 'Thyroid cancer']",,"Much of modern medical research are supported by statistics and machine learning techniques. For the reliability of these studies, it is important to measure the effectiveness of the developed models in making predictions on real medical data. Cross validation is a tool, which provides a principled method of measuring the effectiveness of models and comparing models with each other. This paper presents theoretical and empirical analysis of common cross validation methods. Using sample logistic regression model along with with six different validation methods, comparative analysis has been conducted. The model was developed to determine the level of thyroglobulin hormone, thyroid cancer marker. The marker indicates an increased risk of thyroid cancer metastasis, and is commonly used in metastasis diagnosis. Whereas, literature does not provide a single threshold of thyroglobulin value, indicating an increased risk of metastasis. This paper confirms that one of the main reasons of this lack, is the high variance of the developed models. This research argues that the use of the validation technique also influences both: measures of the model quality and the threshold value. The results show a high discrepancy in the determination of threshold values. However, iterative methods (such as sampling and bootstrap) seem to produce more stable outcomes."

If the 3 experts disagreed, the majority decision was accepted. Abnormality was defined as a condition in which a urologist judges from the UFM results that further evaluation is required and that the patient should visit a urology clinic. To develop the optimal automatic interpretation system, we applied 4 ML algorithms and 2 deep learning (DL) algorithms. ML models were trained with all UFM parameters. DL models were trained to digitally analyze 2-dimensional images of UFM curves.Results: The automatic interpretation algorithm achieved a maximum accuracy of 88.9% in males and 90.8% in females when using 6 parameters: voided volume, maximum flow rate, time to maximal flow rate, average flow rate, flow time, and voiding time. In females, the DL models showed a dramatic improvement in accuracy over the other models, reaching 95.4% accuracy in the convolutional neural network model. The performance of the DL models in clinical discrimination was outstanding in both genders, with an area under the curve of up to 0.957 in males and 0.974 in females.Conclusions: We developed an automatic interpretation algorithm for UFM results by training AI models using 6 key parameters and the shape of the curve; this algorithm agreed closely with the decisions of urology specialists."

Over 50% of adults have at least one of three risk factors, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and smoking, for heart disease. Also, there are other major causes including diabetes, obesity, lack of exercise and heavy drinking. Diagnosing heart disease is a complex medical problem that requires an analysis of a combination of clinical and pathological data. Meeting a need for a high level of clinical expertise for the analysis gives rise to excessive cost. Reducing the cost has become an important issue. To resolve the issue, we propose Heart Relation Graph Neural Network(HRGNN) model with a novel-designed architecture. Specifically, we design Graph Attention Network(GAT)-based heart disease prediction model with three-type clinical information and propose dual-level attention mechanism to learn high-order representation of each type and attribute. HRGNN is can learn the hidden patterns in the high-order graph structure, which is a framework considering the complex type-specific patient data correlations. Health survey data of 401,958 adults provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are used in this study. Our experiments show that HRGNN outperforms existing Graph Neural Networks(GNN) and traditional machine learning models at node classification tasks. Also, it is experimentally demonstrated that three-type branch, dual-level attention modules and data imbalance resolving methods applied to classification models improve the performance."

Traditionally, financial authorities relied primarily on information from the regulatory reports of financial companies and securities issuers for their supervisory and market monitoring activities. More recently, AI analytics have enabled authorities to expand their market monitoring activities and to analyze vast amounts of unstructured data culled from non-traditional information sources, such as online news outlets, social media, blogs, forums, and consumer complaints. Financial authorities have also deployed AI tools to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of traditional market monitoring tasks to detect misconduct, fraud, and illegal behavior, and to protect consumers. The US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) uses AI to target high-risk activities and potential actors, thus improving its ability to allocate scarce agency resources. The relatively slow development of the Korean market monitoring authorities – which include the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) and the Korea Exchange (KRX) – reflects the challenges of implementing an effective AI strategy and the extent of the resources necessary for doing so.  Authorities should ensure the standardization, accuracy, completeness, and integrity of the data, and must address the algorithmic bias issues. A government’s use of AI, especially in areas of financial supervision and enforcement, raises urgent issues with regard to rule of law in administrative actions, accountability, and the transparency of financial supervision. In conjunction with the development of AI, legislators’ and policy makers need to review their country’s financial, data protection, and administrative laws.

Fairness problems refer to certain groups based on sensitive attributes such as gender or race receiving biased decisions in machine learning models compared to other groups. As the imbalance of the dataset has been revealed as one of the causes of the fairness problem, research on fairness related to the imbalance data is being actively conducted. Traditionally, methods for eliminating bias due to data imbalances are over sampling and under sampling techniques. However, traditional data imbalance mitigation techniques have difficulty improving the fairness of the model. Therefore, this paper proposes Random Under Sampling-Based Fairness Improvement Technique Using Overlapping Attribute. This technique finds the overlapping attribute that affect both the performance and fairness of the model among the general attribute of the data set. We then create subgroups based on eigenvalues of overlapping attribute, labels, and sensitive attribute, and mitigate data imbalances between subgroups through random under sampling. The performance of this method was evaluated through different data sets, random partitioning methods, and 10 replicates. In addition, the results of improved fairness were confirmed by using Equal Opportunity, Equalized Odds, Treatment Equality, and Demographic Parity as fairness indicators."

We show a generalization bound for two cases, a linear model for binary classification and neural networks for multi-classification, when the inputs have normal distributed random noises. The additional generalization term caused by random noises is related to margin and exponentially inversely proportional to the noise level for binary classification. And in neural networks, the additional generalization term depends on (input dimension) $\times$ (norms of input and weights). For these results, we used the PAC-Bayesian framework. This paper is considering random noises and margin together, and it will be helpful to a better understanding of model sensitivity and the construction of robust generalization."

Although humans’ creation is still considered to be better and higher, several artificial intelligences continue to challenge human creativity. The quality of some creative outcomes by AI is as good as the real ones produced by human beings. Sometimes they are not distinguishable, because the neural network has the competence to learn the common features contained in big data and copy them. In order to confirm whether artificial intelligence can express the inherent characteristics of different arts, this paper proposes a new neural network model called Humming.

This study developed predictive models for internal air temperature in a mechanically-ventilated broiler house based on the data measured during three rearing periods, which were different in seasonal climate and ventilation operation. Three machine learning models and a mechanistic model based on thermal energy balance were used for the prediction. The results indicated that the all models gave good predictions for 1-minute future air temperature showing the coefficient of determination greater than 0.99 and the root-mean-square-error smaller than 0.306℃. However, for 1-hour future air temperature, only the mechanistic model showed good accuracy with the coefficient of determination of 0.934 and the root-mean-square-error of 0.841℃. Since the mechanistic model was based on the mathematical descriptions of the heat transfer processes that occurred in the broiler house, it showed better prediction performances compared to the black-box machine learning models. Therefore, it was proven to be useful for intelligent microclimate control which would be developed in future studies."

Discovery of Intentional Self-Harm Patterns from Suicide and Self-Harm Surveillance Reports,2022,"['Data Adjustment', 'Machine Learning', 'Data Analysis', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Suicide']",,"Objectives: The purpose of this study was to identify patterns of self-harm risk factors from suicide and self-harm surveillance reports in Thailand. Methods: This study analyzed data from suicide and self-harm surveillance reports submitted to Khon Kaen Rajanagarindra Psychiatric Hospital, Thailand. The process of identifying patterns of self-harm risk factors involved: data preprocessing (namely, data preparation and cleaning, missing data management using listwise deletion and expectation-maximization techniques, subgrouping factors, determining the target factors, and data correlation for learning); classifying the risk of self-harm (severe or mild) using 10-fold cross-validation with the support vector machine, random forest, multilayer perceptron, decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, and ensemble techniques; data filtering; identifying patterns of self-harm risk factors using 10-fold cross-validation with the classification and regression trees (CART) technique; and evaluating patterns of self-harm risk factors. Results: The random forest technique was most accurate for classifying the risk of self-harm, with specificity, sensitivity, and F-score of 92.84%, 93.12%, and 91.46%, respectively. The CART technique was able to identify 53 patterns of self-harm risk, consisting of 16 severe self-harm risk patterns and 37 mild self-harm risk patterns, with an accuracy of 92.85%. In addition, we discovered that the type of hospital was a new risk factor for severe selfharm. Conclusions: The procedure presented herein could identify patterns of risk factors from self-harm and assist psychiatrists in making decisions related to self-harm among patients visiting hospitals in Thailand."

For example, market capitalization of bitcoin exceeded 500 trillion won. Accordingly, many studies have been conducted to predict the price of cryptocurrency, and most of them have similar methodology of predicting stock prices. However, unlike stock price predictions, machine learning become best model in cryptocurrency price predictions, conceptually cryptocurrency has no passive income from ownership, and statistically, cryptocurrency has at least three times higher liquidity than stocks. Thats why we argue that a methodology different from stock price prediction should be applied to cryptocurrency price prediction studies. We propose Reverse Walk-forward Validation (RWFV), which modifies Walk-forward Validation (WFV). Unlike WFV, RWFV measures accuracy for Validation by pinning the Validation dataset directly in front of the Test dataset in time series, and gradually increasing the size of the Training dataset in front of it in time series. Train data were cut according to the size of the Train dataset with the highest accuracy among all measured Validation accuracy, and then combined with Validation data to measure the accuracy of the Test data. Logistic regression analysis and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were used as the analysis model, and various algorithms and parameters such as L1, L2, rbf, and poly were applied for the reliability of our proposed RWFV. As a result, it was confirmed that all analysis models showed improved accuracy compared to existing studies, and on average, the accuracy increased by 1.23%p. This is a significant improvement in accuracy, given that most of the accuracy of cryptocurrency price prediction remains between 50% and 60% through previous studies."

The XGBoost model can derive the best performance by adjusting hyperparameters using the XGBoost Regressor library, which is a regression model. The implemented model is verified using the API provided by DACON, and performance evaluation is performed for each model.

Application of POD reduced-order algorithm on data-driven modeling of rod bundle,2022,"['Proper orthogonal decomposition', 'Machine learning', 'Reduced-order model', 'CFD', 'Fuel rod bundle']",,"As a valid numerical method to obtain a high-resolution result of a flow field, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) have been widely used to study coolant flow and heat transfer characteristics in fuel rod bundles. However, the time-consuming, iterative calculation of Navier-Stokes equations makes CFD unsuitable for the scenarios that require efficient simulation such as sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification. To solve this problem, a reduced-order model (ROM) based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and machine learning (ML) is proposed to simulate the flow field efficiently. Firstly, a validated CFD model to output the flow field data set of the rod bundle is established. Secondly, based on the POD method, the modes and corresponding coefficients of the flow field were extracted. Then, an deep feed-forward neural network, due to its efficiency in approximating arbitrary functions and its ability to handle high-dimensional and strong nonlinear problems, is selected to build a model that maps the non-linear relationship between the mode coefficients and the boundary conditions. A trained surrogate model for modes coefficients prediction is obtained after a certain number of training iterations. Finally, the flow field is reconstructed by combining the product of the POD basis and coefficients. Based on the test dataset, an evaluation of the ROM is carried out. The evaluation results show that the proposed POD-ROM accurately describe the flow status of the fluid field in rod bundles with high resolution in only a few milliseconds."
제어 장벽함수를 이용한 안전한 행동 영역 탐색과 제어 매개변수의 실시간 적응,2022,"['Automatic Gain Tuning', 'Reinforcement Learning', 'Control Barrier Function', 'And Safe Exploration']",,"One of the most fundamental challenges when designing controllers for dynamic systems is the adjustment of controller parameters. Usually the system model is used to get the initial controller, but eventually the controller parameters must be manually adjusted in the real system to achieve the best performance. To avoid this manual tuning step, data-driven methods such as machine learning were used. Recently, reinforcement learning became one alternative of this problem to be considered as an agent learns policies in large state space with trial-and-error Markov Decision Process (MDP) which is widely used in the field of robotics. However, on initial training step, as an agent tries to explore to the new state space with random action and acts directly on the controller parameters in real systems, MDP can lead the system safety-critical system failures. Therefore, the issue of ‘safe exploration’ became important. In this paper we meet ‘safe exploration’ condition with Control Barrier Function (CBF) which converts direct constraints on the state space to the implicit constraint of the control inputs. Given an initial low-performance controller, it automatically optimizes the parameters of the control law while ensuring safety by the CBF so that the agent can learn how to predict and control unknown and often stochastic environments. Simulation results on a quadrotor UAV indicate that the proposed method can safely optimize controller parameters quickly and automatically."

Looking at the importance of variables, in heavy rain, it was found that the precipitation intensity, semi-underground buildings, the threshold of the heavy rain, the frequency of occurrence of the threshold of the heavy rain, and the status of underground buildings had the greatest influence on the damage to buildings due to heavy rain. In the case of strong winds, the higher the normalized city index, steep slope, and poor drainage, the greater the influence.

However, despite abundant data availability because of different prevention policies and situations in each country, the use of data available through machine learning to predict COVID-19 situations in certain countries is still limited. To leverage sufficient data for the prediction using deep learning, we attempted to make predictions via regional spread data in a country for weekly predictions of COVID-19 growth over time using long short-term memory (LSTM) methods. In addition, the numbers of confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths, and the variable population were noted to track the correlation with the accuracy of prediction. The accuracy assessment of the presented model was based on root mean square error, mean absolute percentage error, and graph visualization.

The UK's High Court of Justice and the Court of Appeal, the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, and the Federal Patent Court of Germany (Bundespatentgericht) ruled that the inventor of an invention should be a natural person in terms of respective patent law in force. Meanwhile, the Federal Court of Australia held that artificial intelligence (AI) could also be identified as an inventor under the Patents Act 1990 of Australia. All of these judgments relied on normative, deductive interpretation.However, the patent law is not a fixed norm, as it reflects a strong policy perspective. Therefore, whether AI can be recognized as an inventor cannot be addressed a priori. When it is not studied what specific roles the AI, designated as the inventor of the relevant invention carried out, judgments might be made based on impressions, superficial understandings, and fictional premises, far from the factual ground.ANNs are optimization models that derive desired output from input data through matrix operations, i.e., long sequences of summations and multiplications. Notwithstanding the complexity of “automated” computation, such mathematical calculation should not be equated with an “autonomous” invention of AI. At least under state-of-the-art technology, a machine does nothing but computes an optimal solution based on given data, following the instructions programmed by humans. From the technological point of view, AI can hardly be approved as an inventor yet. There is not much need to do so, even from the normative and policy perspective up to now."

Since these casting defects are discovered during post-processing operations such as heat treatment or finishing work, they cannot be taken in advance at the casting time, which can cause a large number of defects. In this study, we propose an approach that can predict the occurrence of casting defects by defect type using machine learning technology based on casting parameter data collected from equipment in the die casting process in real time. Die-casting parameter data can basically be collected through the casting equipment controller. In order to perform classification analysis for predicting defects by defect type, labeling of casting parameters must be performed. In this study, first, the defective data set is separated by performing the primary clustering based on the total defect rate obtained during the post-processing. Second, the secondary cluster analysis is performed using the defect rate by type for the separated defect data set, and the labeling task is performed by defect type using the cluster analysis result. Finally, a classification learning model is created by collecting the entire labeled data set, and a real-time monitoring system for defect prediction using LabView and Python was implemented.

Interference intention classification of moving obstacles used for USV collision avoidance,2022,"['Unmanned Surface Vessels (USV)', 'Interference intention classification', 'Machine vision', 'Collision avoidance', 'Machine learning']",,"Unmanned Surface Vessels (USV) may interfere with ships in the same lane during navigation and may be affected by ships that actively collide or intercept the USV. Evidently, the latter poses a greater threat than the former. This paper proposes the concept of active and inactive interference. It is necessary for the USV to accurately classify the vessels’ intentions to conduct a suitable collision avoidance strategy.However, the existing research on collision avoidance of USV focuses on avoiding moving obstacles and rarely considers the interference intention of dynamic obstacles for USV when choosing collision avoidance strategies. This paper proposes an algorithm to recognize the interference intention of ships by combining visual classification with a Support Vector Machine (SVM). First, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is proposed to distinguish the merchant ship from a high-performance ship that actively interferes with the USV with high probability. A high-dimensional feature dataset was designed to illustrate the navigation characteristics of an obstacle, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was then employed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset for obstacle classification. A modified SVM is presented to classify obstacles into active and inactive interference intention categories. Moreover, an escape algorithm based on an improved artificial potential field method is proposed for vessels with active interference. The simulation and experimental results clearly show that the USV can successfully identify the interference intention of obstacles and adopt a specific collision avoidance strategy for obstacles with active interference intentions. Using this algorithm, the USV can safely avoid obstacles with different interference intentions."

Prediction Model of Real Estate ROI with the LSTM Model based on AI and Bigdat,2022,"['Real Estate', 'AI', 'Bigdata', 'Prediction', 'LSTM', 'Machine learning', 'Deep learning', 'Time series forecasting']",,"Across the world, ‘housing’ comprises a significant portion of wealth and assets. For this reason, fluctuations in real estate prices are highly sensitive issues to individual households. In Korea, housing prices have steadily increased over the years, and thus many Koreans view the real estate market as an effective channel for their investments. However, if one purchases a real estate property for the purpose of investing, then there are several risks involved when prices begin to fluctuate. The purpose of this study is to design a real estate price ‘return rate’ prediction model to help mitigate the risks involved with real estate investments and promote reasonable real estate purchases. Various approaches are explored to develop a model capable of predicting real estate prices based on an understanding of the immovability of the real estate market. This study employs the LSTM method, which is based on artificial intelligence and deep learning, to predict real estate prices and validate the model. LSTM networks are based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) but add cell states (which act as a type of conveyer belt) to the hidden states. LSTM networks are able to obtain cell states and hidden states in a recursive manner. Data on the actual trading prices of apartments in autonomous districts between January 2006 and December 2019 are collected from the Actual Trading Price Disclosure System of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT). Additionally, basic data on apartments and commercial buildings are collected from the Public Data Portal and Seoul Metropolitan Government’s data portal. The collected actual trading price data are scaled to monthly average trading amounts, and each data entry is pre-processed according to address to produce 168 data entries.

Also, high price, no safe transaction, the more the courier transaction, and the higher the ratio of 0 in the price also led to fraud."
정압설비의 효율적 관리를 위한 예측모형 활용방안 연구,2022,"['Static pressure facility', 'time series', 'machine learning', 'prediction', 'safety management']",,"The demand for urban gas continues to increase and is widely used in homes and industries. However, if the demand for urban gas is not properly predicted, the management costs of inventory increase, and supply and demand management is inefficient. For a stable supply of city gas, it is necessary to predict the pressure of the city gas static pressure device which maintains the gas pressure suitable for the gas user device at a constant level. This paper aims to increase the pressure management efficiency of the static pressure system by using pressure prediction model based on the time series model and the machine learning model. The data for analysis is pressure data collected based on the SCADA system. We added temperature variables, which affect the pressure, for analysis. Temperature variables are collected at the same time when the pressure of the stator is collected. After data preprocessing, training data and validation data for prediction are generated. The prediction model is implemented using SARIMA model, SARIMAX model, LSTM model, and Transformer model. As a result of the prediction, it was confirmed that the RMSE of the SARIMAX model was the lowest at 0.0248."
Performance evaluation of mask R-CNN for lung segmentation using computed tomographic images,2022,"['Mask R-CNN', 'Segmentation', 'Network architecture', 'Optimizer', 'Computed tomography']",,"Image segmentation techniques based on machine learning are able to improve diagnostic and therapeutic accuracy by localizing target areas. The accuracy and efciency of these techniques are dependent on network architecture and loss minimization method because the performance of a machine learning model is determined by training strategies. In this study, the lung segmentation based on computed tomographic images was performed by using mask regional convolutional neural networks (R-CNNs) with various feature extraction networks and optimizers. The efects of the feature extraction networks and optimizers on the trained mask R-CNNs were evaluated in terms of total training loss, segmentation accuracy and training time. The results showed that the convergence of total loss values during network training was afected by the architectures of the feature extraction networks as well as the optimizers. The lung segmentation accuracy and training time of the mask R-CNN were mainly dependent on the optimizer and network architecture, respectively. Among the various optimizers, the ASGD optimizer maximized lung segmentation accuracy, and the training time was reduced by the feature extraction network including general convolution layers and feature pyramid network (FPN). In conclusion, it is important to apply the optimal network architecture and optimizer to the mask R-CNN for maximizing its performance, and the optimized mask R-CNN can be potentially used for improving diagnostic and therapeutic accuracy."
Examining the Effects of Vocabulary on Crowdfunding Success: A Comparison of Cultural and Commercial Campaigns,2022,"['Crowdfunding', 'Campaign Pitch', 'Creator', 'Lexicon Analysis', 'Machine Learning']",,"Crowdfunding has emerged as an important financing source for diverse cultural projects and commercial ventures in the early stages. Unlike traditional investment evaluation, where structured financial data is critical, such information is typically unavailable for crowdfunding campaigns. Instead, campaign creators prepare pitches containing essential information about themselves and the campaigns, which are crucial in attracting and persuading contributors. Prior literature has examined the effects of different aspects in campaign pitches, but a comprehensive understanding of the theme is lacking. This study aims to fill this gap by identifying the lexicon of frequently used vocabulary in campaign pitches and examining how they are associated with crowdfunding success. Moreover, we examine how the association differs between culture and commercial crowdfunding campaigns. We randomly collected 50,000 campaigns from the cultural and commercial categories on Kickstarter and extracted the 100 most used verbs in the campaign pitches. Based on a machine learning approach combined with principal component analysis, we constructed sets of verbal factors statistically significant in predicting crowdfunding success. The findings also show that cultural and commercial campaigns consist of different verbal components with different effects on crowdfunding success."
Exploration of Potential Gut Microbiota-Derived Biomarkers to Predict the Success of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Ulcerative Colitis: A Prospective Cohort in Korea,2022,"['Fecal microbiota transplantation', 'Fecal microbiota transplantation outcome', 'Machine learning', 'Ulcerative colitis']",,"Background/Aims: Although fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been proven as one of the promising treatments for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), potential prognostic markers regarding the clinical outcomes of FMT remain elusive.Methods: We collected fecal samples of 10 participants undergoing FMT to treat UC and those from the corresponding donors. We categorized them into two groups: responders and nonresponders.Sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was conducted on the samples to explore bacterial composition.Results: Analyzing the gut microbiota of patients who showed different outcomes in FMT presented a distinct microbial niche. Source tracking analysis showed the nonresponder group had a higher rate of preservation of donor microbiota, underscoring that engraftment degrees are not one of the major drivers for the success of FMT. At the phylum level, Bacteroidetes bacteria were significantly depleted (p<0.003), and three genera, including Enterococcus, Rothia, and Pediococcus, were enriched in the responder group before FMT (p=0.003, p=0.025, and p=0.048, respectively). Furthermore, we applied a machine learning algorithm to build a prediction model that might allow the prediction of FMT outcomes, which yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.844. Notably, the microbiota-based model was much better at predicting outcomes than the clinical features model (area under the ROC curve=0.531).Conclusions: This study is the first to suggest the significance of indigenous microbiota of recipients as a critical factor. The result highlights that bacterial composition should be evaluated before FMT to select suitable patients and achieve better efficiency."

Comparative study on reduced models of unsteady aerodynamics using proper orthogonal decomposition and deep neural network,2022,"['Computational fluid dynamics', 'Reduced order model', 'Non-intrusive proportional orthogonal decomposition', 'Deep neural network', 'Unsteady flow', 'Machine learning']",,"Data-driven researches based on various machine learning techniques, are being actively explored in science and technology areas. In the area of computational fluid dynamics, several studies have already been conducted in a reduced order modeling technique using principal orthogonal basis called proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). Recently the application of machine learning techniques represented by deep learning or deep neural network (DNN) to the existing reduced order model methods is increasingly drawing attention with the development of processor hardware technology such as GPU. This study, based on the data produced by a state-of-the-art flow solver, examined both POD and DNN techniques to three different methods: a) classical non-intrusive POD with local linear regression, b) fully-connected DNN, and c) mixed POD-DNN. Method a) and c) have difference in computing superposed time expansion coefficients. The target problem is unsteady aerodynamic simulation of a two dimensional airfoil with fixed angle-of-attack and three grid and flow condition sets: (structured grid, inviscid flow, Mach 0.2), (structured grid, turbulent flow, Mach 0.6, Reynolds 1x10 5 ), and (unstructured grid, laminar flow, Mach 0.4). The comparison items were flow fields of velocity/pressure for all cases and aerodynamic lift/drag performances only for the structured grid system respectively. In these computations the overall tendencies of aerodynamic lift and drag are similar, but the POD with existing local linear regression method in calculating time coefficients was found to show the highly robust and moderately accurate predictions. The direct DNN method was judged to be able to be used as a feasible reduced order model since it overcomes linearity error at both extracting POD basis and determining coefficients and has an advantage to be able to infer flow variables in arbitrary spatial locations. It showed better level of error than the classical POD method, but had model optimization cost to tune hyper-parameters and determine how many training data should be obtained to mitigate partial error. As an intermediate way, the mixed POD-DNN provided a robust reduced model of airfoil aerodynamic simulation due to the moderate computational cost and better accuracy comparing to the two other methods, but it had a shortcoming of fixed spatial coordinates like the classical POD method because the POD basis has fixed dimension of vector. In conclusion, fully-connected deep neural network method is helpful to predict flow field distribution as a universal field approximator in accordance with time and space such as fluid field simulation in this study, and, what is better, using POD basis will augment the accuracy and computational efficiency."

Artificial Intelligence for Detection of Cardiovascular- Related Diseases from Wearable Devices: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2022,"['Electrocardiography', 'photoplethysmography', 'artificial intelligence', 'cardiovascular disease', 'machine learning', 'deep learning']",,"Purpose: Several artificial intelligence (AI) models for the detection and prediction of cardiovascular-related diseases, including arrhythmias, diabetes, and sleep apnea, have been reported. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify AI models developed for or applicable to wearable and mobile devices for diverse cardiovascular-related diseases.Materials and Methods: The searched databases included Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library. For AI models for atrial fibrillation (AF) detection, a meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy was performed to summarize sensitivity and specificity.Results: A total of 102 studies were included in the qualitative review. There were AI models for the detection of arrythmia (n=62), followed by sleep apnea (n=11), peripheral vascular diseases (n=6), diabetes mellitus (n=5), hyper/hypotension (n=5), valvular heart disease (n=4), heart failure (n=3), myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest (n=2), and others (n=4). For quantitative analysis of 26 studies reporting AI models for AF detection, meta-analyzed sensitivity was 94.80% and specificity was 96.96%. Deep neural networks showed superior performance [meta-analyzed area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.981] compared to conventional machine learning algorithms (meta-analyzed AUROC of 0.961). However, AI models tested with proprietary dataset (meta-analyzed AUROC of 0.972) or data acquired from wearable devices (meta-analyzed AUROC of 0.977) showed inferior performance than those with public dataset (meta-analyzed AUROC of 0.986) or data from in-hospital devices (meta-analyzed AUROC of 0.983).Conclusion: This review found that AI models for diverse cardiovascular-related diseases are being developed, and that they are gradually developing into a form that is suitable for wearable and mobile devices."
A Study on Predicting the demand for Public Shared Bikes using linear Regression,2022,"['Shared bikes', 'demand forecasts', 'linear regression', 'machine learning', 'AI']",,"As the need for eco-friendly transportation increases due to the deepening climate crisis, many local governments in Korea are introducing shared bicycles. Due to anxiety about public transportation after COVID-19, bicycles have firmly established themselves as the axis of daily transportation. The use of shared bicycles is spread, and the demand for bicycles is increasing by rental offices, but there are operational and management difficulties because the demand is managed under a limited budget. And unfortunately, user behavior results in a spatial imbalance of the bike inventory over time. So, in order to easily operate the maintenance of shared bicycles in Seoul, bicycles should be prepared in large quantities at a time of high demand and withdrawn at a low time. Therefore, in this study, by using machine learning, the linear regression algorithm and MS Azure ML are used to predict and analyze when demand is high. As a result of the analysis, the demand for bicycles in 2018 is on the rise compared to 2017, and the demand is lower in winter than in spring, summer, and fall. It can be judged that this linear regression-based prediction can reduce maintenance and management costs in a shared society and increase user convenience. In a further study, we will focus on shared bike routes by using GPS tracking systems. Through the data found, the route used by most people will be analyzed to derive the optimal route when installing a bicycle-only road."
Classification Model and Crime Occurrence City Forecasting Based on Random Forest Algorithm,2022,"['Random Forest Algorithm', 'Crime Rates', 'CCTV', 'Machine Learning Model']",,"Korea has relatively less crime than other countries. However, the crime rate is steadily increasing. Many people think the crime rate is decreasing, but the crime arrest rate has increased. The goal is to check the relationship between CCTV and the crime rate as a way to lower the crime rate, and to identify the correlation between areas without CCTV and areas without CCTV. If you see a crime that can happen at any time, I think you should use a random forest algorithm. We also plan to use machine learning random forest algorithms to reduce the risk of overfitting, reduce the required training time, and verify high-level accuracy. The goal is to identify the relationship between CCTV and crime occurrence by creating a crime prevention algorithm using machine learning random forest techniques. Assuming that no crime occurs without CCTV, it compares the crime rate between the areas where the most crimes occur and the areas where there are no crimes, and predicts areas where there are many crimes. The impact of CCTV on crime prevention and arrest can be interpreted as a comprehensive effect in part, and the purpose is to identify areas and frequency of frequent crimes by comparing the time and time without CCTV."

Materials and Methods: This study employed 79 features of clinical pathology, laboratory tests, and therapeutic details from 289 GC patients whose distant lymphadenopathy was presented as the first episode of recurrence or metastasis. Outcomes were measured as any-cause death events and survival months after distant lymph node metastasis. A prediction model was built based on possible outcome predictors using a random survival forest algorithm and confirmed by 5×5 nested cross-validation.

In Korean,a sentence is a sequence of eojeols (words) separated by spaces. Each eojeol comprises one or more morphemes. Korean morphologicalanalysis (KMA) is to divide eojeols in a given Korean sentence into morpheme units. It also includes assigning appropriatepart-of-speech(POS) tags to the resulting morphemes. KMA is one of the most important tasks in Korean natural language processing(NLP). Improving the performance of KMA is closely related to increasing performance of Korean NLP tasks. Recent research on KMAhas begun to adopt the approach of machine translation (MT) models. MT is to convert a sequence (sentence) of units of one domaininto a sequence (sentence) of units of another domain. Neural machine translation (NMT) stands for the approaches of MT that exploitneural network models. From a perspective of MT, KMA is to transform an input sequence of units belonging to the eojeol domain intoa sequence of units in the morpheme domain. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model for KMA. The backbone of our modelis based on the BERT-fused model which was shown to achieve high performance on NMT. The BERT-fused model utilizes Transformer,a representative model employed by NMT, and BERT which is a language representation model that has enabled a significant advancein NLP.

EMG Pattern Recognition Using TFD for Future Control of In-Car Electronic Equipment,2022,"['Electromyography', 'Time-frequency distribution', 'Spectrogram', 'Machine learning', 'Support vector machine', 'Pattern recognition']",,"Distracted drivers contribute to motor vehicle accidents. The maneuvering of in-car electronic equipment and controls, which typically requires the driver’s hands to be off the wheel and eyes off the road, are important factors that distract drivers. To minimize the interference of such distractions, a new control method is presented for detecting and decoding human muscle signals, which is known as electromyography (EMG). It is associated with various fingertips and pressures, and allows the mapping of various commands to control in-car equipment without requiring hands off the wheel. The most important step to facilitate such a scheme is to extract a highly discriminatory feature that can be used to separate and compute different EMG-based actions. The aim of this study is to accurately analyze EMG signals and classify finger movements that can be used to control in-car electronic equipment using a time–frequency distribution (TFD). The average root mean square voltage of seven participants and fourteen different finger movements are extracted as EMG features using a TFD. Four machine learning classifiers, i.e., support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, linear discriminant, and K-nearest neighbor (KNN), are used to classify pointing finger classes. The overall accuracy of the SVM precedes that of the other classifiers (89.3%), followed by decision tree (57.1%), linear discriminant (34.5%), and KNN (27.4%). The findings of this study are expected to be used in real-time applications that require both time and frequency information. Integrating the EMG signal to control in-car electronic equipment is expected to reduce the number of motor vehicle crashes globally."

However, in the case of classical music, there still remain some difficulties in applying machine learning techniques.Genre classification or music recommendation systems generated by deep learning algorithms are actively used in general music, but not in classical music. In this paper, we attempted to classify opera among classical music. To this end, an experiment was conducted to determine which criteria are most suitable among, composer, period of composition, and emotional atmosphere, which are the basic features of music. To generate emotional labels, we adopted zero-shot classification with four basic emotions, ‘happiness’, ‘sadness’, ‘anger’, and ‘fear.’ After embedding the opera libretto with the doc2vec processing model, the optimal number of clusters is computed based on the result of the elbow method. Decided four centroids are then adopted in k-means clustering to classify unsupervised libretto datasets. We were able to get optimized clustering based on the result of adjusted rand index scores. With these results, we compared them with notated variables of music. As a result, it was confirmed that the four clusterings calculated by machine after training were most similar to the grouping result by period. Additionally, we were able to verify that the emotional similarity between composer and period did not appear significantly. At the end of the study, by knowing the period is the right criteria, we hope that it makes easier for music listeners to find music that suits their tastes."

Improved marine predators algorithm for feature selection and SVM optimization,2022,"['Marine predators algorithm', 'co-evolutionary cultural mechanism', 'feature selection', 'support vector machine', 'hyperparameters optimization']",,"Owing to the rapid development of information science, data analysis based on machine learning has become an interdisciplinary and strategic area. Marine predators algorithm (MPA) is a novel metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the foraging strategies of marine organisms. Considering the randomness of these strategies, an improved algorithm called co-evolutionary cultural mechanism-based marine predators algorithm (CECMPA) is proposed. Through this mechanism, search agents in different spaces can share knowledge and experience to improve the performance of the native algorithm. More specifically, CECMPA has a higher probability of avoiding local optimum and can search the global optimum quickly. In this paper, it is the first to use CECMPA to perform feature subset selection and optimize hyperparameters in support vector machine (SVM) simultaneously. For performance evaluation the proposed method, it is tested on twelve datasets from the university of California Irvine (UCI) repository. Moreover, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be a real-world application and is spreading in many countries. CECMPA is also applied to a COVID-19 dataset.

KL(Kullback-Leibler) divergence에 근거하여 적응적으로 커널폭을 조절하는 방법이 소개되었으나 갱신 방정식의 분모에 커널폭 세제곱을 내포하고 있다. 이 연구에서 이 커널폭 세제곱 항이 충격성 잡음 상황의 수렴속도를 매우 느리게 만드는 요인임이 발견되었다. 이에 이 논문에서는 수렴속도에 부정적 영향을 미치는 이 세제곱 항을 제거하면서도 동일한 최적 커널폭을 보유하는 보완된 적응 커널 조절법을 제안한다. 채널 equalization 실험을 통하여 학습곡선의 정상상태에서 오차평균전력이 3 dB 이상 향상을 보이며 제안한 방식의 우수성을 입증하였다.","Minimum error entropy (MEE) as a method of information theoretic learning has been effectively used in many applications such as signal processing, machine learning and automatic control in Gaussian or non-Gaussian noise environments. The choice of kernel width is very sensitive and has important effects on system performance. In many signal processing environments, the error signal is usually non-stationary so that the fixed kernel width is not appropriate for implement of the MEE algorithm. The conventional kernel width adaptation methods based on Kullback-Leibler divergence contain the cube of kernel width in the denominator of its update equation. This term is found in this paper to lead to a very slow convergence in impulsive noise situations. This paper presents a modified kernel width adaptation method in a way that removes the term having negative impact on convergence speed while preserving the same optimum kernel width. The experiment of channel equalization demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method in learning performance by showing above 3dB enhancement in steady state MSE."

Plants consumed by humans affect various biological activity mechanism of the human body. Cytotoxicity, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant mechanisms are the major biological activities of the plants. Constructing a database of plants and their biological activities is essential because it is used as foundation data for novel drug discovery from natural products. One of the ways to construct plant-biological activity database is to analyze the various literature on plant compound information. Although numerous articles that studied the relationship between the plants and the mechanism of biological activities are registered in PubMed, it requires lots of time and labor even for the relevant domain experts to screen relevant articles from numerous search results and to extract information from the text. To construct plant-biological activity database efficiently, we have developed a document screening and information extraction tool supported by text-mining techniques. The system provides a feature that groups articles into a particular biological activity or plant and another feature that highlight keywords in different colors. Additionally, an automatic article classification feature is provided to rapidly screen relevant and irrelevant documents. In future studies, more annotation automation features can be added to the system by adapting advanced machine learning techniques. Our system may be modified and applied for text data analysis of various research domains."

As concrete is a brittle material, it is easily broken by external impact and can lead to serious accidents due to loss of function, so periodic management is essential. In this paper, we propose a crack management system using the embedded device for drone mounting. The embedded device for drone mounting is connected to a distance sensor, GPS module, and a camera to photograph the bridge in real time and uses a machine learning algorithm to find cracks in the bridge. When the embedded device finds a crack with a camera, it sends JSON formatted crack detection data including GPS position, timestamp, base64 encoded image data, and additional information to the crack management server over MQTT. We also propose a crack management algorithm and implemented a crack management server using a proposed algorithm.

The unique feature of the MIT-ATR is that the measurement images are translated to the simulation-like images by cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN). CycleGAN does not need to have a dataset of paired images between the measurement and simulation images. The generated simulation-like images are used as the inputs of the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) network. The VGG network is trained on a simulation database with a softmax layer of multi-classes. Five classes, including a T-72 tank, are considered in the numerical experiments. The images of each class are simulated at all azimuth angles, but the elevation angles range from 6° to 30°. The accuracy of the proposed approach is 63% better than that of the traditional method with only the VGG network. The simulation database could definitely supplement the lack of measurement data.

뇌-컴퓨터 인터랙션 오탐 저감을 위한 뇌파-턱 근전도 통합 신호 제어 프로토콜 개발,2022,"['Brain computer interface', 'False alarm correction', 'Steady-State visually evoked potential', 'Machine learning', 'Random forest']",,"(EMG) induced by jaw-clenching can be accurately observed in steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) signals at occipital lobes as well as temporal lobes. We also investigated a feasibility that the fused SSVEP data with the jaw-clenching EMG can be classified as a function of task types characterized by SSVEPs with and without the short and long clenching noise. Based on this hypothesis, we proposed a novel command protocol to effectively and efficiently reduce false alarms caused by using SSVEP brain-computer interface (BCI).Background: Much attention has been paid to various brain-computer interfaces for neural rehabilitation and alternative communication channels for disabled people with severe neurological disorders. However, despite the interests in BCI, false alarms caused by interference effects between command flickers with different frequencies or internal and external noises have been still problematic and have yet to be investigated. Even though protocols to correct the false alarms based on error-related potential (ErrP) or eye blinks have been proposed, it has still limitation due to errors inherent in involuntary reactions of humans. Thus, it is necessary to develop a protocol to address the issue and propose a method insusceptible to the involuntary reactions.Method: Nine undergraduate students (3 female) voluntarily participated in the experiment. They were asked to divide their attention between the two squares randomly oscillating with 8.57 and 10Hz and perform three types of tasks characterized by SSVEP only, short clenching, and long clenching conditions. They carried out the three tasks with a semi-counterbalanced and random order and rest interval between the tasks was set to 10 minutes to minimize order and carryover effects. It took about 12 minutes in completing the experimental tasks for each participant. We used five machine learning algorithms of binary classification to compare the performance in classifying the brainwave signals characterized by the three tasks.Results: As a result of the classification comparison, random forest showed the highest classification performance of more than 0.85 (AUC) as follows: 0.88 (short clenching vs. SSVEP), 0.87 (long clenching vs. SSVEP), 0.85 (long clenching vs. short clenching condition) in the test data set. Notably, the findings implicated a clear classification in the long cand short clenching condition even at the frequency band of more than 20Hz. For the participants whose highest weight factor was shown at the occipital lobe, it can be possible to reduce false alarms in the SSVEP BCI with only single electrode at the occipital lobe.Conclusion: The findings found in this study implicate that the proposed protocol can be used to effectively and efficiently correct false alarms in event-related potential (ERP), event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) BCI as well as SSVEP BCI. On top of that, classifying the subtle changes in the jaw clenching types enables BCI developers to create additional commands to modulate their BCI system. The results can be greatly improved if weight factors in the binary classification are modulated as a function of individual characteristics.Application: The findings obtained in this study can be utilized in developing asynchronous BCI very robust to false alarms and expected to provide a future direction into hybrid BCI system."

We analyze result in fve learning architectures such as the traditional artifcial neural network, deep neural network, and extreme learning machine, long short-term memory, and long-short-term memory with peephole connections, after manipulating the computer simulation. Our neural network modes are trained on the daily time-series dataset during 7 years (from 2014 to 2020). From the trained results for 2500, 5000, and 7500 epochs, we obtain the predicted accuracies of the meteorological factors produced from outputs in ten metropolitan cities (Seoul, Daejeon, Daegu, Busan, Incheon, Gwangju, Pohang, Mokpo, Tongyeong, and Jeonju). The error statistics is found from the result of outputs, and we compare these values to each other after the manipulation of fve neural networks. As using the long-shortterm memory model in testing 1 (the average temperature predicted from the input layer with six input nodes), Tonyeong has the lowest root-mean-squared error (RMSE) value of 0.866 (%) in summer from the computer simulation to predict the temperature. To predict the humidity, the RMSE is shown the lowest value of 5.732 (%), when using the long short-term memory model in summer in Mokpo in testing 2 (the average humidity predicted from the input layer with six input nodes).Particularly, the long short-term memory model is found to be more accurate in forecasting daily levels than other neural network models in temperature and humidity forecastings. Our result may provide a computer simulation basis for the necessity of exploring and developing a novel neural network evaluation method in the future."

Therefore, it is very important to understand the population data. However, not all countries are well equipped with a system to measure their own population, so in this case, the estimated population rather than the actual population is substituted for the national population data. There may be several methods of estimating the population of countries classified as underdeveloped, but in this study, an indirect population estimation method using night satellite image was proposed. While known methods use night satellite images as auxiliary information for population estimation, the method proposed in this study proposes a model that estimates the population only with night satellite image. A model was proposed to estimate the grid population using the DMSP-OLS (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program) nighttime satellite image provided by the US NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). For model development, South Korea s night satellite image and grid population were used excluding Seoul and the metropolitan area, and statistical models and ensemble models of machine learning were compared to obtain optimal results from the proposed model.

However, only complex and expensive manufacturing methods such as fine pattern alignment technology have been considered. To replace the existing smart sensor, which has to go through a complicated process, a new approach including a simple piezoresistive patch based on artificial intelligence has been suggested. Specifically, a 16-electrode terminal was connected to the edge of a polydimethylsiloxane pad where multi-walled carbon nanotube sheets are well dispersed, and a voltage input to the center of the specimen. The collected data was calculated using a voltage divider circuit to collect the voltage data. 54 random positions were marked on the pad. 4 positions were configured as the validation data set and 50 positions as the training data set. We examined whether it was possible to determine points in untrained positions using a deep neural network (DNN) and 12 different machine learning (ML) algorithms. The result of a deep neural network for untrained point location identification was MSE: 0.00026, R2: 0.991158, and the result of Random Forest, an ensemble model among ML algorithms, was MSE: 0.00845, R2: 0.971239.

Long Song Type Classification based on Lyrics,2022,"['Mongolian Long Song', 'Song Genre Classification by Lyrics', 'Machine Learning', 'Feature Extraction from Song Lyrics']",,"Mongolian folk songs are inspired by Mongolian labor songs and are classified into long and short songs. Mongolian long songs have ancient origins, are rich in legends, and are a great source of folklore. So it was inscribed by UNESCO in 2008. Mongolian written literature is formed under the direct influence of oral literature. Mongolian long song has 3 classes: ayzam, suman, and besreg by their lyrics and structure. In ayzam long song, the world perfectly embodies the philosophical nature of world phenomena and the nature of human life. Suman long song has a wide range of topics such as the common way of life, respect for ancestors, respect for fathers, respect for mountains and water, livestock and animal husbandry, as well as the history of Mongolia. Besreg long songs are dominated by commanded and trained characters.

This study modeled relationships between energy consumption and built environmental factors to compare determinants in average and energy-vulnerable households. While the conventional approach of identifying energy vulnerability often relies on household income, this study suggested a new approach by considering the energy-vulnerable group as a low-income class with high energy expenditure. A traditional regression model (semi-log regression) and advanced machine learning algorithm (ensemble gradient boosting, XGboost) were employed to maximize the performance of the modeling processes. The results indicated that the overall modeling performance was superior with regard to the machine learning algorithm, producing the r-squared value of 0.92 for the energy-vulnerable households, compared to the 0.34 of the semi-log regression model. While the direction of the association of the determinants was similar in the average and energy-vulnerable households, the level of association exhibited a clear difference, especially for the effect of income (comparing 0.30 to 0.03) and housing type (comparing -0.45 to -0.63).

A Study of Job Failure Prediction on Supercomputers with Application Semantic Enhancement,2022,"['Execution efficiency', 'Job failure prediction', 'Application semantic enhancement', 'Machine learning']",,"The powerful computing capabilities of supercomputers play an important role in today’s scientific computing. A large number of high-performance computing jobs are submitted and executed concurrently in the system. Job failure can cause a waste of system resources and impact the efficiency of the system and user jobs. Job failure prediction can support fault-tolerant technology to alleviate this phenomenon in supercomputers. At present, the related work mainly predicts job failure by collecting the real-time performance attributes of jobs, but it is difficult to apply in the real environment because of the high cost of collecting job attributes. In addition to analyzing the time and resource attributes in the job logs, this study also explores the semantic information of jobs. We mine job application semantic information from job names and job paths, where job path is collected by additional monitoring of the job submitting process. A prediction method based on job application semantic enhancement is proposed, and the prediction results of the non-ensemble learning algorithm and the ensemble learning algorithm are compared under each evaluation indicator. This prediction method requires more miniature feature collection and computation overhead and is easy to apply. The experimental results showed that the prediction effect was promisingly improved with job application semantic enhancement, and the final evaluation indicator S_score was improved by 5%–6%, of which was 88.16% accuracy with 95.23% specificity and 88.24% sensitivity."

Material and methods: 403 electronic medical documents were extracted retrospectively and classified using the cosine similarity calculated by Scikit-learn (Python module for machine learning) in Jupyter Notebook. Vectors for medical documents were produced by three different vectorization techniques (TF-IDF, latent sematic analysis and Word2Vec) and the classification precisions for three vectorization techniques were evaluated. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to determine if there was a significant difference among three vectorization tech- niques. Results: 403 medical documents were relevant to 41 different diseases and the average number of documents per diagnosis was 9.83 (standard deviation=3.46). The classification precisions for three vectorization techniques were 0.78 (TF-IDF), 0.87 (LSA) and 0.79 (Word2Vec).

This paper presents an innovative method to investigate human workers in manufacturing sys- tems by collecting data through a human-in-the-loop (HITL) experiment based on virtual reality (VR) technology and analyzing using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. First, a HITL exper- iment was designed and performed in a VR environment with a simple manufacturing task to collect behavior data of participants: hand behaviors, time consumed, and failures. To see if data collected could discriminate participants, multiple machine learning (ML) models were trained using the hand behaviors’ data. Most ML models showed an accuracy over 90%. In addition, an agent is modeled using the remaining data as inputs. The overall relationship between the physi- cal capabilities and the system was confirmed from the simulation results. The findings show the feasibility of applying AI and VR based HITL to examine human workers and extending it to develop realistic digital twins of the manufacturing systems."

Sewing videos were created for face-to-face apparel construction courses, and students’ opinions on sewing videos as an educational tool were collected. Videos with subtitles were offered to Apparel Construction Course 1, whereas videos with narration and subtitles were offered to Apparel Construction Course 2. As “supplemental learning materials,” students rated videos as more effective for learning and satisfying than “documents with text and images.” The effectiveness and satisfaction scores for Apparel Construction Course 2 were significantly higher than those for Apparel Construction Course 1. Furthermore, videos were utilized significantly more than documents, and most students preferred videos over documents. The main benefits of videos as supplemental learning materials were repetitive learning at the learner’s convenience and the detailed presentation of the sewing process. Students regarded narration as more effective and satisfying than subtitles. Narrations were expected to be offered along with subtitles. As “demonstration tools,” students rated videos as more effective for learning and satisfying than traditional “sewing samples.” Students preferred “demonstration with videos” to “demonstration with sewing samples.” The main benefits of video demonstration were a close-up view, presentation of the entire sewing process, and shorter wait time without the need for group teaching. Students wanted more sewing videos and narrations to be offered, and various sewing machine feet to be used in the videos. Educational methods for sewing were suggested based on student opinions."

Faults occur frequently owing to concentrated loads on the contact areas between balls and race tracks, which directly affect operation of the rotating machinery. To prevent such issues in advance, studies on the fault classification models have been carried out, for which various machine learning algorithms were considered. To attain a high accuracy fault classification model, even though sufficient collected fault data are needed, there are still limit and restriction on this purpose. In the present study, a fault classification model for a ball bearing was proposed, in which CNN (convolution neural network) algorithm was applied to classify faults with a high accuracy even for insufficient collected fault data. The CNN model was constructed after training with the vibration signals acquired from operating ball bearing including normal condition and five fault types. In addition, other fault classification models were prepared using conventional machine learning algorithms, such as MLP (multi-layer perceptron) and LSTM (long short-term memory). The obtained results were compared with those of the CNN algorithm. Subsequently, the availability of the CNN model was verified with insufficient collected fault data."

According to the predicted output, defect analysis is classified into defect prediction, defect regression, and defect-severity prediction. Many studies have been proposed to outperform at each output. However, when an actual user wants to obtain multiple output information with multiple models, there is a problem of low consistency between the outputs of the models. In this work, we simultaneously predict the following three outputs with one model: bug identification, the number of bugs, and the severity of bugs to increase consistency between outputs. To this end, we propose an X-MOCNN, which combines XGBoost and a Multi-Output 1-d Convolutional Neural Network. We compare the performance of a single-output neural network model and a machine learning model to verify the effectiveness of our proposed model. As a result of the experiment, X-MOCNN shows higher performance and consistency between outputs than the other models. Therefore, it is expected that the method presented by us can effectively allocate quality assurance resources by predicting multiple outputs with one model in a software project."

Three-dimensional human activity recognition by forming a movement polygon using posture skeletal data from depth sensor,2022,"['feature representation', 'human action and activity recognition', 'Kinect sensor', 'trajectory']",,"Human activity recognition in real time is a challenging task. Recently, a plethora of studies has been proposed using deep learning architectures. The implementation of these architectures requires the high computing power of the machine and a massive database. However, handcrafted features-based machine learning models need less computing power and very accurate where features are effectively extracted. In this study, we propose a handcrafted model based on three-dimensional sequential skeleton data. The human body skeleton movement over a frame is computed through joint positions in a frame. The joints of these skeletal frames are projected into two-dimensional space, forming a “movement polygon.” These polygons are further transformed into a one-dimensional space by computing amplitudes at different angles from the centroid of polygons. The feature vector is formed by the sampling of these amplitudes at different angles. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using a support vector machine on four public datasets: MSR Action3D, Berkeley MHAD, TST Fall Detection, and NTU-RGB+D, and the highest accuracies achieved on these datasets are 94.13%, 93.34%, 95.7%, and 86.8%, respectively. These accuracies are compared with similar state-of-the-art and show superior performance."

Most of the existing studies suggest the generative model which controls one property. Along with creating a generator, one of the most important factors to be considered in designing an algorithm is an optimization method which can simultaneously guarantee various properties that the molecules must have. One way to implement it on a deep generative model is to estimate the posterior distribution through sampling and then optimize the generator in a direction to satisfy multiple purposes. In this manner, we propose a novel method which optimizes the posterior distribution of the generative model with the generated data which satisfy multiple objectives through self-data augmentation and learning by incorporating the Thomson sampling technique into VAE (Variational Auto-Encoder). To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method, we aimed at generating molecules for BCL2 family proteins and compared the binding affinity of the proposed method with several baseline models. The practical usability of the proposed method was confirmed by measuring the various chemical properties and synthesizability of the molecules."

In this article, I illuminate the theoretical perspective of ‘governing attention’ that makes attention an object of management and government, rather than the perspective of attention economy that basically makes it a scarce economic resource. I show how power to govern attention produces and enacts a variety of knowledge, expertise, technology, and subjectivity by analyzing the recommendation system of YouTube, the most influential social media in our society. The YouTube recommendation system is a digital captivating technology trying to hold onto our attention as long as possible, drawing on behavioural psychology and persuasive design. In addition, this recommendation system is constantly generating and shaping new attention based on our behavioural data and machine learning, rather than capturing the already-given attention. The goal of the recommendation system to extend the waching time as much as possible goes beyond commercial value, becoming technical rationality and morality of engineers. The personalization of the recommendation system isn’t aimed at predicting users’ preferences, interests and tastes, but at devising and implementing metrics that can categorize us. As a result, new subjects, who consider their own preferences and tastes as valuable and seek to manage them with the help of technology, are formed: these ‘psycho-algorithmic subjects’ believe that they can optimize their preferences and tastes by training the system with their behavioral data and explicit evaluation. In conclusion, I argue that the perspective of attention economy tends to emphasize the economy surrounding attention, thus understating the social-material construction of attention while overstating the agency of algorithms. Finally, given that recommender systems are becoming the infrastructure of everyday life, I argue that it is necessary to study various recommender systems in our daily life in order to explore concrete answers on how we can intervene in the power to govern our attention."

Although AI appears in various fantasy narratives, a multi-layered and detailed approach is taking place, it is also noteworthy that it also begins within the premise already imagined in common. Another major feature is that these familiar settings naturally lead to the agreed narrative, including basic mechanical settings of character AI, learning about functions and environments, and errors. Therefore, Character AI is a problematic character that can expand the exterior of our narrative, which has developed around probability, in the boundary between reality and fantasy, humans and non-humans, creatures and non-living things.This paper examines the epic position by reading the AI implemented (imagined) in the narrative as a character, distinguishing it from the real world's AI through Ku Byung-mo's long story, ""Time of One Spoon"" The AI Eun-gyeol in this work raises the fundamental question of the novel ""What is humanity"" in the new terrain we will soon face, with familiar narratives in basic settings, learning processes, and points of error. The part that the narrative dealing with character AI pays attention to is also about boundaries, like other fantasy narratives. Therefore, the settings as a machine and unexpected errors at the same time as the programmed learning process are also familiar devices to induce discussions on the boundaries.

Therefore, in order to activate technology transfer, various machine learning methods are being studied to identify success factors or to match public technology with high commercialization potential and demanding companies. However, public technology commercialization data is in the form of a table and has a problem that machine learning performance is not high because it is in an imbalanced state with a large difference in success-failure ratio. In this paper, we present a method of utilizing CTGAN to resolve imbalances in public technology data in tabular form. In addition, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, a comparative experiment with SMOTE, a statistical approach, was performed using actual public technology commercialization data. In many experimental cases, it was confirmed that CTGAN reliably predicts public technology commercialization success cases."

As above, in order to effectively identify cyber anomalies, several studies have been conducted to learn BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) data through a machine learning model and identify them as anomalies. However, BGP data is unbalanced data in which abnormal data is less than normal data. This causes the model to have a learning biased result, reducing the reliability of the result. In addition, there is a limit in that security personnel cannot recognize the cyber situation as a typical result of machine learning in an actual cyber situation. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) that keeps network records around the world and solve the problem of unbalanced data by using SMOTE. After that, assuming a cyber range situation, an autoencoder classifies cyber anomalies and visualizes the classified data. By learning the pattern of normal data, the performance of classifying abnormal data with 92.4% accuracy was derived, and the auxiliary index also showed 90% performance, ensuring reliability of the results. In addition, it is expected to be able to effectively defend against cyber attacks because it is possible to effectively recognize the situation by visualizing the congested cyber space."

In addition, it was confirmed that if the AI service isperformed remotely rather than locally, even if it is a machine with good performance, it takes more time to infer the AI service thanif it is performed locally. Through the results of this study, it is expected that system design suitable for service goals, AI model development,and efficient AI service production will be possible."

However, the data that AI learns through machine learning is nothing more than a collection of past law enforcement records. In other words, it is data that reflects the prejudice and discrimination of the past. AI learned from such data is difficult to derive fair prediction results. Therefore, using the output as it is without making any corrections poses a risk of doing great injustice under the guise of technical, objective, and neutral science.The European Parliament's Resolution 2020/2016(INI) of October 2021 is located at this point. It insisted that the decisions made by AI should not be used as it is in criminal matters until it can be trusted that AI with transparency and accountability does not harm the fundamental rights of citizens. Above all, EU citizens have the‘right not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated processing’by GDPR Article 22 and Law Enforcement Directive Article 11. This resolution of the European Parliament has a special legal character reaffirming this right in the field of criminal justice.However, in the long term, it is expected that the number of cases of AI support in the criminal justice system will increase due to lack of budget, human resources and delayed cases. So, what position should we take on the hybrid decision of machines and humans? The European Union is reluctant to follow the past cases that triggered legal and ethical problems with AI by entrusting it to self-regulation by private companies. They seek to protect the fundamental rights of citizens and align with the ideals of criminal justice by strengthening the transparency and accountability of AI through public intervention. The European Parliament resolution 2020/2016(INI) of October 2021 is a noteworthy document that sets out such a goal in the field of criminal justice."

We obtained results from 5-folds validations with combinations of different activation functions and compared with each other, and the one with the best validation score is used to classify the test data. In this experiment, features used to train the model are obtained from the ADNI database after processing them using FreeSurfer software. For 5-folds validation, two groups: AD and CN are classified.

In the reviewed literature, AI is applied in classification, localization, disease detection, disease segmentation, and fit degree of registration images. In machine learning (ML), prior feature extraction and inputting the extracted feature values ​​into the neural network have disappeared. Instead, it appears that the neural network is changing to a deep learning (DL) method with multiple hidden layers. The reason is thought to be that feature extraction is processed in the DL process due to the increase in the amount of memory of the computer, the improvement of the calculation speed, and the construction of big data.  In order to apply the analysis of medical images using AI to medical care, the role of physicians is important. Physicians must be able to interpret and analyze the predictions of AI algorithms.

It plays a crucial role in legal evidence, forensic investigation, defence, and many more places. In the proposed CMFD method, a two-step identification of forgery is presented. In step one, the suspected image will be classified into either one of two classes that are forged or authentic. Step two is carried out​ only if the suspected is classified as forged, then forged location will be identified using the block-matching procedure. Initially, the suspected image is decomposed into different orientations using Steerable Pyramid Transform (SPT); Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features are extracted from each orientation. These features are used to train Optimized Support Vector Machine (OSVM) as well as to classify. If the suspected image is categorized into forged, then the suspected grey image is converted into overlapping blocks, and from each block, GLCM features are extracted. The proper similarity threshold value and distance threshold value can locate the forged region using GLCM block features. The performance of the proposed method is tested using standard datasets CoMoFoD and CASIA Datasets. The proposed CMFD approach results are consistent, even the forged image suffered from attacks like JPEG compression, scaling, and rotation. The OSVM classifier is showing superiority over the Optimized Naive Bayes Classifier (ONBC), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)."

They are the severe class imbalance and lots ofOut-of-Distribution samples. Some good strategies such as the oversampling over the minority class, and the down-sampling over themajority class, are well known to handle the class imbalance. In addition, SMOTE has been chosen to address the issue recently. But,Out-of-Distribution samples have been studied just with neural networks. It seems to be hardly shown that Out-of-Distribution detectionis applied to the predictive model using conventional machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest and KNN. It is knownthat conventional machine learning algorithms are much better than neural networks in prediction performance, because neural networksare vulnerable to over-fitting and requires much bigger dataset than conventional machine learning algorithms does. So, we suggestsa new approach to utilize Out-of-Distribution detection based on SVM algorithm. In addition to that, bagging technique will be adoptedto improve the precision of the model."

Therefore, this study analyzed whether there are areas where existing functions can be improved or new functions can be added using big data and AI functions through analysis of domestic logistic analytic platforms. As a result, it seemed that existing services needed to establish data-sharing strategies and further machine learning solutions to investigate multiple internal and external data sources. In addition, in order to secure differentiation from existing services, a machine learning algorithm was designed to predict the weight and price of targeted items based on bill of landing data. Throughout the experiment, we observed that while LSTM does not work well for overall data, the linear regression and MLP models showed good overall performance. It confirmed the models could be used to provide the weight and price prediction services for countries and items targeted to export. The models built in this study are dockerized as a public API service in the future so that researchers and developers can use them actively."

Unfortunately, the current state-of-the-art catalysts still suffer from high cost of noble metals, insufficient catalytic activity and long-term stability. Furthermore, the current strategy to develop new catalysts relies on “trial-and-error” method, which could be time-consuming and inefficient. To tackle this challenge, atomic-level simulations have demonstrated the potential to facilitate catalyst discovery. For the past decades, the simulations have become reasonably accurate so that they can provide useful insights toward the origin of experimentally observed improvements in catalytic properties. In addition, with the exponential increase in computing power, high-throughput catalyst screening has become feasible. More excitingly, recent advances in machine learning have opened the possibility to further accelerate catalyst discovery. Herein, we introduce recent applications and challenges of computation and machine learning for catalyst discovery."

Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews to Identify Deceptive Rating Information in Social Media: A SentiDeceptive Approach,2022,"['Sentiment Analysis', 'Opinion Mining', 'Customer Reviews', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Imbalance', 'Deceptive reviews', 'Flipkart', 'Amazon']",,"[Introduction] Nowadays, many companies are shifting their businesses online due to the growing trend among customers to buy and shop online, as people prefer online purchasing products. [Problem] Users share a vast amount of information about products, making it difficult and challenging for the end-users to make certain decisions. [Motivation] Therefore, we need a mechanism to automatically analyze end-user opinions, thoughts, or feelings in the social media platform about the products that might be useful for the customers to make or change their decisions about buying or purchasing specific products. [Proposed Solution] For this purpose, we proposed an automated SentiDecpective approach, which classifies end-user reviews into negative, positive, and neutral sentiments and identifies deceptive crowd-users rating information in the social media platform to help the user in decision-making. [Methodology] For this purpose, we first collected 11781 end-users comments from the Amazon store and Flipkart web application covering distant products, such as watches, mobile, shoes, clothes, and perfumes. Next, we develop a coding guideline used as a base for the comments annotation process. We then applied the content analysis approach and existing VADER library to annotate the end-user comments in the data set with the identified codes, which results in a labelled data set used as an input to the machine learning classifiers. Finally, we applied the sentiment analysis approach to identify the end-users opinions and overcome the deceptive rating information in the social media platforms by first preprocessing the input data to remove the irrelevant (stop words, special characters, etc.) data from the dataset, employing two standard resampling approaches to balance the data set, i-e, oversampling, and under-sampling, extract different features (TF-IDF and BOW) from the textual data in the data set and then train & test the machine learning algorithms by applying a standard cross-validation approach (KFold and Shuffle Split). [Results/Outcomes] Furthermore, to support our research study, we developed an automated tool that automatically analyzes each customer feedback and displays the collective sentiments of customers about a specific product with the help of a graph, which helps customers to make certain decisions. In a nutshell, our proposed sentiments approach produces good results when identifying the customer sentiments from the online user feedbacks, i-e, obtained an average 94.01% precision, 93.69% recall, and 93.81% F-measure value for classifying positive sentiments."
인공지능 및 빅데이터와 최대선의원칙의 고찰 -정보비대칭과 상법상 고지의무를 중심으로-,2022,"['인공지능', '빅데이터', '최대선의원칙', '선의원칙', '고지의무', '정보비대칭', '보험계약법', '정보제공의무', '보험소비자', '인슈어테크', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Utmost Good Faith', 'Good Faith', 'Duty of Disclosure', 'Information Asymmetry', 'Insurance Law', 'Insurance Consumer', 'Insurtech']",,"Traditionally, the principle of utmost good faith of insurance contract has been emphasized due to information asymmetry biased towards policyholders, but it has been criticized for being advantageously applied only to insurers despite the modernization of the insurance environment. As the use of digitized data expands, the traditional information asymmetry is also changing. It is also argued that there are some problems on the principle of utmost good faith, which is biased toward the policyholder's obligations, and that the duty of disclosure needs to be revised.However, along with the development of IT technology, we are witnessing a phenomenon in which insurers easily access to a substantial amount of big data or risk information of contractors, and advance the risk measurement and analysis through sophisticated artificial intelligence algorithms. In such a situation, it is necessary to consider whether the principle of utmost good faith is still an outdated value that should be discarded or excluded. In a future environment where the area of autonomous judgment increases, such as the reversal of information asymmetry and the complicated AI decision-making process using big data, various dispute situations that are difficult to resolve with the existing specific legal provisions may arise. In such a case, the principle of utmost good faith is more likely to be used as a principle of action for insurers or as a remedy for damage of insurance consumers. For example, an insurer may need to disclose data analysis results or algorithm related matters to the policyholder. In an AI environment, the insurer’s duty to provide information would be based on the principle of utmost good faith. Originally, the principle of utmost good faith started from reciprocity, which includes not only the policyholder's duty to disclosure, but also the insurer's duty to provide information. As an insurer, the insurer must also faithfully fulfill its obligations of fairness and honesty by fulfilling its obligations in the best good faith beyond simply providing information. Examples of concrete examples of the insurer's utmost good faith obligation include the duty to confirm and explain machine learning or algorithms, the duty to provide incidental information, and the duty to prevent distortion in insurance premium calculation.On the other hand, the inferences provided by machine learning models, such as risk prediction, are based on correlations and are not necessarily causal in the specific problem of fulfilling the duty of disclosure. When only correlation is considered, all matters potentially related to insurance accidents are reflected in the underwriting or rate calculation by extremely advanced artificial intelligence. In this case, there is a risk that the policyholder's responsibility for the violation of notification may be significantly expanded compared to the existing case, so it may be necessary to adjust the standards for fulfilling the duty of disclosure in the future. In addition, since the policyholder needs to know what risk information is transmitted to the insurer and what its impact is, there is a need for the insurer to disclose information about risk measurement to the insured and receive confirmation.The autonomous decision and execution of artificial intelligence algorithms in the insurance field is expected to continue to develop and expand in the future. In a complex and esoteric technological environment, in conclusion, the principle of utmost good faith is likely to be judged in favor of policyholder as the basis for insurers' obligations. Here, the meaning of the principle of utmost good faith, which was considered a traditional characteristic of insurance contracts, is emphasized again."

Of the 572 articles, 29 relevant original research articles were included and evaluated according to the RQS, TRIPOD checklist, and IBSI guidelines.Results: External validation was performed in only three studies (10.3%). The median RQS was 3.0 (range, -6 to 12), with a low basic adherence rate of 50.0%. The adherence rate was low in comparison to the “gold standard” (10.3%), stating the potential clinical utility (10.3%), performing the cut-off analysis (3.4%), reporting calibration statistics (6.9%), and providing open science and data (3.4%). None of the studies involved test-retest or phantom studies, prospective studies, or cost-effectiveness analyses. The overall rate of adherence to the TRIPOD checklist was 60.3% and low for reporting title (3.4%), blind assessment of outcome (0%), description of the handling of missing data (0%), and presentation of the full prediction model (0%).

What Can BERT Do for English Linguistics?: A Case Study of Examining It-cleft Constructions,2022,"['deep-learning', 'language model', 'it-cleft', 'pronominal case', 'platform']",,"This study used the machine learning technique known as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to understand the pronominal distribution in it-cleft constructions. While language models (LMs) have successfully been used to examine and verify linguistic representations, most studies have focused on the general phenomenon of subject-verb agreement. As such, this study focused on the particular construction known as it-cleft, in order to consolidate the LM’s role as a linguistic platform. In the experiment using BERT, the surprisal of each case (i.e., nominative and accusative) is compared. The investigation successfully replicated the findings of previous studies, specifically by capturing the use of the accusative form, inhibition of the first-person pronominal, and collocate feature of the first-person pronominal with the complementizer who.The results from the LM also deliver further contribution to the study of it-cleft, involving the between number and the relationship between the pronominal and syntactic role. Thus, the usage of BERT both revealed new research questions while verifying evidence from previous studies on the it-cleft pronominal. This demonstrates that BERT can correctly represent particular constructions and broadens the possibilities of LMs as a linguistic platform."

GCNXSS: An Attack Detection Approach for Cross-Site Scripting Based on Graph Convolutional Networks,2022,"['Web security', 'Cross-site Scripting', 'Graph Convolutional Networks(GCN)']",,"Since machine learning was introduced into cross-site scripting (XSS) attack detection, many researchers have conducted related studies and achieved significant results, such as saving time and labor costs by not maintaining a rule database, which is required by traditional XSS attack detection methods. However, this topic came across some problems, such as poor generalization ability, significant false negative rate (FNR) and false positive rate (FPR). Moreover, the automatic clustering property of graph convolutional networks (GCN) has attracted the attention of researchers. In the field of natural language process (NLP), the results of graph embedding based on GCN are automatically clustered in space without any training, which means that text data can be classified just by the embedding process based on GCN. Previously, other methods required training with the help of labeled data after embedding to complete data classification. With the help of the GCN auto-clustering feature and labeled data, this research proposes an approach to detect XSS attacks (called GCNXSS) to mine the dependencies between the units that constitute an XSS payload. First, GCNXSS transforms a URL into a word homogeneous graph based on word co-occurrence relationships. Then, GCNXSS inputs the graph into the GCN model for graph embedding and gets the classification results.

역사 맞춤형 정책 수립을 위한 지하철 역사의 유형화 및 특성 분석에 관한 연구: 서울 지하철 사례를 중심으로,2022,"['Analysis', 'Clustering', 'Machine Learning', 'Seoul Metropolitan Subway']",,"The Seoul metropolitan subway opened in 1974, and it became popular public transportation used by an average of 4.61 million passengers per day in 2021. Furthermore, by generating a vast amount of traffic data, it is showing value beyond public transportation. Developed countries utilize a combination of public transportation data and other types of data to efficiently develop public transportation operations and passenger-specific policies. On the other hand, despite various types of subway stations being added over time, the domestic study considers data of a single type (e.g., congestion, passenger, etc.). Such studies cannot effectively utilize traffic information and are challenging to utilize in various types of Seoul metropolitan subway. In this study, we aim to classify Seoul metropolitan subway from Line 1 to Line 9 by utilizing various data related to subway stations to suggest customized policies. The experiment results showed that the areas around the subway stations were categorized into three types: highly residential types, university·capital types, and transfer·commercial types. Our findings can provide appropriate policies for each type of subway station."
Improving communication protocols in smart cities with transformers,2022,"['Vanets', 'ALOHA', 'Machine learning', 'LSTM', 'Transformers']",,"Adaptive medium access control (MAC) protocols are essential in the context of Vehicular AdHoc Networks (Vanets) because of the rapid changes in topology caused by the high mobility of nodes. In this work, we propose an adaptive version of the Slotted-ALOHA (S-ALOHA) protocol, where the transmission probability is constantly adjusted based on estimates of the number of vehicles in the coverage area. These values are computed using deep learning models for time series prediction. One challenge for implementing this approach is that the inputs to the models are noisy since they are also estimates based on the protocol’s operation itself. To address this problem, we propose a new training scheme where we add noise, similar to that produced by the protocol’s operation, to the inputs of the training examples as a form of regularization. Our experiments show that the regularized models perform close to the theoretical optimal where the number of vehicles in the area is always known."

As the number of cycles increases, the performance of these devices generally degrades owing to tool wear. Therefore, real-time tool condition monitoring (TCM) that utilizes statistical or machine learning methods has gained significant attention in both academia and industry. However, these methods necessitate sufficient data pre-processing, requiring a high degree of academic understanding as well as significant amount of time. Therefore, this research proposes an advanced artificial intelligence network to monitor a wide range of tools by utilizing raw signals without pre-processing. This study first developed a method consisting of 1D and 2D multi filters convolution neural networks (CNNs) and stacked long short term memories (LSTM). To activate the LSTM in a stable manner, the CNN plays a crucial role in dimensionality reduction. Accordingly, two dimensionality reduction approaches were proposed. These were layer normalized 1D&2D-CNN Multi filters. Then, following multi filters, the stacked LSTM was used to extract the sequential features. Next, the performance of the proposed network using the NASA milling dataset was observed and compared between the 1D/2D-CNN without Flank wear information, pre-processing, and previous research network inclusion. Consequently, although the 1D-CNN method did not have them, it achieved a similar level of accuracy as the present method using past Flank wear input."

The data have been obtained from 30 previously piloted experimental studies (resulted 113 samples). Achieved results for the model including all the input data provide the most excellent prediction of the exerted lateral pressure. Additionally, having different magnitudes of powder volume, aggregate volume and fluid content in the mix exposes different rising and descending in the lateral pressure outcomes. The results indicate that each model has its own advantages and disadvantages; however, the root mean square error values of the SVR models are lower than that of the ANN model.

Strawberries with the highest added value and the most traded in Korea were selected for prediction. To predict the price of agricultural products, related data were collected and a random forest algorithm was applied. As a result of the study, the RMSE, which indicates the difference between the predicted price and the actual price by the model, was 0.102, which is interpreted as explaining the price of agricultural products relatively well. Accurate price prediction of agricultural products is expected to be useful if the government adjusts the supply of agricultural products and makes it a service for general consumers to use."

Humans basically have a desire to live comfortably.People want someone else to do difficult and troublesome work for them.So he came to utilize a machine to do the job.Due to the development of machines, it has reached a stage where robots can do difficult and dangerous tasks accurately and efficiently. These robots perform tasks according to algorithms coded by programmers. If the design changes, the algorithm must also be modified. This is also annoying. For this reason, it is also trying to have AI develop algorithms for AI. Eventually, AI is expected to have autonomy and independence. Furthermore, as self-preservation and object proliferation become possible, it seems that it will become a species.In this way, if AI becomes Super AI, it must take responsibility for its own actions. Since the person who developed the algorithm is AI, the responsibility should belong to AI if the result of legal infringement occurs. Therefore, AI itself must come within the normative order.The process of internalizing the normative order is called socialization.Socialization is completed over a long period of time through constant punishment for deviant behavior. The fact that the normative order has been internalized means that a person is aware of the fact that he will be punished if he violates the norm, and does not violate the norm because he is afraid of being punished. Therefore, socialization is only possible for beings who can recognize pain and remember it.So, in order for AI to come into the normative order, AI needs a sense of pain. It is up to the programmers to give the AI the ability to feel pain and train it to come within the normative order. Even if the legal system that mandates this is prepared at the domestic law level, there are limits to its effectiveness. The main body that develops strong AI will be companies. Compaies make a profit by producing goods and selling them to consumers. The most important thing for a company is to receive consumer choice.After all, in order to induce programmers who develop AI to develop norm-friendly AI, there is no choice but to let consumers choose normfriendly artificial intelligence robots as products. Normal consumers would prefer norm-friendly AI, so if the facts are explained as they are, moving consumers’ psychology will not be a problem."

In Korea, damages from landslides occur frequently, making it necessary to develop the effective response strategies. In particular, there is a lack of countermeasures against landslides in cultural heritage areas. The purpose of this study was to spatially analyze the relationship between Buyeo-gun's cultural heritage and landslide susceptible areas in Buyeo-gun, Chungcheongnam-do, which has a long history. Nine spatial distribution models were used to evaluate the landslide susceptibility, and the ensemble method was applied to reduce the uncertainty of individual model. There were 17 cultural heritages belonging to the landslide susceptible area. As a result of calculating the area ratio of the landslide susceptible area for cultural heritages, the cultural heritages with 100% of the area included in the landslide susceptible area were “Standing statue of Maae in Hongsan Sangcheon-ri” and “Statue of King Seonjo.” More than 35% of “Jeungsanseong”, “Garimseong”, and “Standing stone statue of Maitreya Bodhisattva in Daejosa Temple” belonged to landslide susceptible areas. In order to effectively prevent landslide damage, the application of landslide prevention measures should be prioritized according to the proportion belonging to the landslide susceptible area. Since it is very difficult to restore cultural properties once destroyed, preventive measures are required before landslide damage occurs. The approach and results of this study provide basic data and guidelines for disaster response plans to prevent landslides in Buyeo-gun."

This study tried to predict PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Seoul, where high concentrations of fine dust occur frequently, using two ensemble models, random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) using 15 local data assimilation and prediction system (LDAPS) weather-related factors, aerosol optical depth (AOD) and 4 chemical factors as independent variables. Performance evaluation and factor importance evaluation of the two models used for prediction were performed, and seasonal model analysis was also performed. As a result of prediction accuracy, RF showed high prediction accuracy of R<sup>2</sup> = 0.85 and XGB R<sup>2</sup> = 0.91, and it was confirmed that XGB was a more suitable model for PM<sub>2.5</sub> prediction than RF. As a result of the seasonal model analysis, it can be said that the prediction performance was good compared to the observed values with high concentrations in spring. In this study, PM<sub>2.5</sub> of Seoul was predicted using various factors, and an ensemble-based PM<sub>2.5</sub> prediction model showing good performance was constructed."

Research to produce a landslide susceptibility map with high accuracy is steadily being conducted, and various models have been applied to landslide susceptibility analysis. Pixel-based machine learning models such as frequency ratio models, logistic regression models, ensembles models, and Artificial Neural Networks have been mainly applied. Recent studies have shown that the kernel-based convolutional neural network (CNN) technique is effective and that the spatial characteristics of input data have a significant effect on the accuracy of landslide susceptibility mapping. For this reason, the purpose of this study is to analyze landslide vulnerability using a pixel-based deep neural network model and a patch-based convolutional neural network model. The research area was set up in Gangwon-do, including Inje, Gangneung, and Pyeongchang, where landslides occurred frequently and damaged. Landslide-related factors include slope, curvature, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), topographic position index (TPI), timber diameter, timber age, lithology, land use, soil depth, soil parent material, lineament density, fault density, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI) were used. Landslide-related factors were built into a spatial database through data preprocessing, and landslide susceptibility map was predicted using deep neural network (DNN) and CNN models. The model and landslide susceptibility map were verified through average precision (AP) and root mean square errors (RMSE), and as a result of the verification, the patch-based CNN model showed 3.4% improved performance compared to the pixel-based DNN model. The results of this study can be used to predict landslides and are expected to serve as a scientific basis for establishing land use policies and landslide management policies."

Unlike listed companies, it is difficult to predict the future value of a startup company for investment because there is a lack of information on the startup. In this paper, we propose a method that predicts the future value of startups using an ensemble classification model. To help investment decisions, we divide startups into a few classes based on the changing rate of the future value compared with the current value and predict which class a given startup will belong to. The proposed method collects financial, non-financial, and company value data from startups for training classification models. It predicts the class of the startup using a soft-voting ensemble method that combines the five most accurate models among 18 classification models. The experimental results using 206 startup investment data show that the proposed method accomplishes 17%P higher classification accuracy on average than the relative valuation method based on Price Sales Ratio (PSR)."

Would AI Ever “Want”?: How Far Can AI Simulate Human Creativity,2022,"['artificial intelligence', 'creativity', 'subjectivity', 'psychoanalysis', 'desire']",,"Given enough training in machine learning, AI can now create all kinds of art works―from painting to poetry―and often in a style more sophisticated than those by many human beings. But so far, AI’s so-called creativity has to be initiated and concluded by the humans, it does not have the “urge” to create. On the other hand, a human being engages in a creative act precisely because he has this urge, which in psychoanalysis is alternately called desire. Psychoanalysis argues, following Freud, that “having desire” is the fundamental truth of human beings. A double-edged sword, desire cuts the child off from his being but gives him a subjectivity, albeit grounded in an emptiness or “want” at its core. It is this “want”/desire that motivates all human actions, especially the various kinds of creative activities such as art and literature. Can AI emulate human beings also in terms of spontaneity? That is, can AI desire? Would it ever “want”?"

Positioning is the primary association with LBS services. This study proposes an intelligent LoRa-based positioning system, called AI@LBS, to provide accurate location data. The fingerprint mechanism with the clustering algorithm in unsupervised learning filters out signal noise and improves computing stability and accuracy. In this study, data noise is filtered using the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm, increasing the positioning accuracy from 95.37% to 97.38%. The problem of data imbalance is addressed using the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) technique, increasing the positioning accuracy from 97.38% to 99.17%.

Prediction of Micro-scale Forces in Dry Grinding Process Through a FEM—ML Hybrid Approach,2022,"['Grinding forces', 'Single-grit FEM simulation', 'Machine learning']",,"Grinding process modeling represents a great challenge due to its stochastic nature. The uncertainty factor of grinding technology is mainly attributable to the undefined grain morphology, with the influence of this aspect becoming more pronounced in a dry configuration. Even though grinding has always used lubricants, nowadays the reduction or complete elimination of this element could mean a significant reduction in environmental pollution. Many modeling approaches have been used in literature to investigate phenomena related to grinding but each exhibits some disadvantages. In this paper a hybrid FEM—ML approach is proposed to forecast forces generated by the action of a single grain in dry conditions, overcoming the main modeling limitations observed to date. Experiments and force measurements were performed on a CNC surface grinding machine using sintered aluminum oxide grains of size 60. FEM simulations were developed in DEFORM 3D to predict grinding forces and increase the data set. ML algorithms were proposed to increase model prediction productivity and optimize the control of process parameters."

To develop the model, the training dataset was produced by pre-processing 50 block codes that were on the popular block programming language web site ‘Entry’. Also, after dividing the pre-processed blocks into training dataset, verification dataset and test dataset, we developed a model that generates block codes based on LSTM, Seq2Seq, and GPT-2 model.

We started by gathering a real chest X-ray image dataset, including positive Covid-19, normal cases, and other lung diseases not caused by Covid-19. Instead of training deep networks from scratch, we fine-tuned recent pre-trained deep network models, such as DenseNet121, MobileNet v2, Inception v3, Xception, ResNet50, VGG16, and VGG19, to classify chest X-ray images into one of three classes (Covid-19, normal, and other lung). We propose training an SVM model on top of deep networks to perform a nonlinear combination of deep network outputs, improving classification over any single deep network. The empirical test results on the real chest X-ray image dataset show that deep network models, with an exception of ResNet50 with 82.44%, provide an accuracy of at least 92% on the test set. The proposed SVM on top of the deep network achieved the highest accuracy of 96.16%."
Practical method to improve usage effi ciency of bike-sharing systems,2022,"['bike-sharing system', 'bike prediction', 'bike relocation', 'machine learning', 'smart city']",,"Bicycle- or bike-sharing systems (BSSs) have received increasing attention as a secondary transportation mode due to their advantages, for example, accessibility, prevention of air pollution, and health promotion. However, in BSSs, due to bias in bike demands, the bike rebalancing problem should be solved. Various methods have been proposed to solve this problem; however, it is difficult to apply such methods to small cities because bike demand is sparse, and there are many practical issues to solve. Thus, we propose a demand prediction model using multiple classifiers, time grouping, categorization, weather analysis, and station correlation information. In addition, we analyze real-world relocation data by relocation managers and propose a relocation algorithm based on the analytical results to solve the bike rebalancing problem. The proposed system is compared experimentally with the results obtained by the real relocation managers."
Predicting quorum sensing peptides using stacked generalization ensemble with gradient boosting based feature selection,2022,"['Gram-positive bacterium', 'quorum sensing peptides', 'machine learning', 'stacked generalization ensemble', 'feature selection', 'gradient boosting machines']",,"Bacteria exist in natural environments for most of their life as complex, heterogeneous, and multicellular aggregates. Under these circumstances, critical cell functions are controlled by several signaling molecules known as quorum sensing (QS) molecules. In Gram-positive bacteria, peptides are deployed as QS molecules. The development of antibodies against such QS molecules has been identified as a promising therapeutic intervention for bacterial control. Hence, the identification of QS peptides has received considerable attention. Availability of a fast and reliable predictive model to effectively identify QS peptides can help the existing high throughput experiments.In this study, a stacked generalization ensemble model with Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)-based feature selection, namely EnsembleQS was developed to predict QS peptides with high accuracy. On selected GBM features (791D), the EnsembleQS outperformed finely tuned baseline classifiers and demonstrated robust performance, indicating the superiority of the model. The accuracy of EnsembleQS is 4% higher than those resulting from ensemble model on hybrid dataset.When evaluating an independent data set of 40 QS peptides, the EnsembleQS model showed an accuracy of 93.4% with Matthew’s Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) values 􀁇􀁇of 0.91 and 0.951, respectively. These results suggest that EnsembleQS will be a useful computational framework for predicting QS peptides and will efficiently support proteomics research.

This multicenter cohort study investigated the clinicoradiological characteristics relevant to the differential diagnosis of such lesions.Materials and Methods: From June to September 2015, 4787 thyroid nodules (≥ 1.0 cm) with a final diagnosis of benign follicular nodule (BN, n = 4461), follicular adenoma (FA, n = 136), follicular carcinoma (FC, n = 62), or follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC, n = 128) collected from 26 institutions were analyzed. The clinicoradiological characteristics of the lesions were compared among the different histological types using multivariable logistic regression analyses. The relative importance of the characteristics that distinguished histological types was determined using a random forest algorithm.Results: Compared to BN (as the control group), the distinguishing features of follicular-patterned neoplasms (FA, FC, and FVPTC) were patient’s age (odds ratio [OR], 0.969 per 1-year increase), lesion diameter (OR, 1.054 per 1-mm increase), presence of solid composition (OR, 2.255), presence of hypoechogenicity (OR, 2.181), and presence of halo (OR, 1.761) (all p < 0.05). Compared to FA (as the control), FC differed with respect to lesion diameter (OR, 1.040 per 1-mm increase) and rim calcifications (OR, 17.054), while FVPTC differed with respect to patient age (OR, 0.966 per 1-year increase), lesion diameter (OR, 0.975 per 1-mm increase), macrocalcifications (OR, 3.647), and non-smooth margins (OR, 2.538) (all p < 0.05). The five important features for the differential diagnosis of follicular-patterned neoplasms (FA, FC, and FVPTC) from BN are maximal lesion diameter, composition, echogenicity, orientation, and patient’s age. The most important features distinguishing FC and FVPTC from FA are rim calcifications and macrocalcifications, respectively.Conclusion: Although follicular-patterned lesions have overlapping clinical and radiological features, the distinguishing features identified in our large clinical cohort may provide valuable information for preoperative distinction between them and decision-making regarding their management."

The movement of robot arm and motion of robot gripper is determined based on the measured IMU and EMG data, respectively. To overcome user dependence which is one of main disadvantage of EMG-based motion recognition, reference voluntary contraction method-based normalization of measured EMG data is carried out. Training and test data of EMG are obtained from experiments for four kinds of hand motion of four experimental participants. After extraction of feature vectors, artificial neural network is applied for the EMGbased hand motion recognition. Even when training data and test data are obtained from different participants, it is confirmed that classification accuracy can be greatly improved through the proposed simple normalization method. Finally, a real-time tele-manipulation of 6-degree-offreedom robot arm is demonstrated successfully by adopting the proposed user independent human motion recognition method."

We used 5 domains (motor, language, cognition, social-emotional, adaptive behavior) of the Korean version of the Bayley scale of infant and toddler development III (K-Bayley III) to group subjects. K-means clustering (KM), hierarchical clustering, and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise were used. We used the average silhouette index (ASI) and Calinski-Harabasz (C-H) score as evaluation metrics.Results: KM showed the best performance (ASI, 0.25; C-H score, 58.83) and revealed 3 clusters. Cluster 1 (need observation) showed low normal scores in K-Bayley III Scales, and cluster 2 (excellent development) showed high normal scores. In contrast, cluster 3 (global delay) showed delayed or borderline scores other than the social-emotional scale. Maternal age (P<0.01), number of fetuses (P=0.03), prenatal steroid use (P=0.01), pH (P<0.01), and base excess (P=0.03) showed a statistical significance among the 3 clusters.Conclusion: The authors found 3 phenotypes with distinct developmental outcomes among late preterm infants and discovered variables necessary for their prediction.

예측성향을 고려한 비대칭 서포트벡터 회귀의 적용,2022,"['Support V ector R egression', 'M achin e Learnin g', 'Predictiv e Propensity']",,"Most of the predictions using machine learning are neutral predictions considering the symmetrical situation where the predicted value is not smaller or larger than the actual value. However, in some situations, asymmetric prediction such as over-prediction or under-prediction may be better than neutral prediction, and it can induce better judgment by providing various predictions to decision makers. A method called Asymmetric Twin Support Vector Regression (ATSVR) using TSVR(Twin Support Vector Regression), which has a fast calculation time, was proposed by controlling the asymmetry of the upper and lower widths of the ε-tube and the asymmetry of the penalty with two parameters. In addition, by applying the existing GSVQR and the proposed ATSVR, prediction using the prediction propensities of over-prediction, under-prediction, and neutral prediction was performed. When two parameters were used for both GSVQR and ATSVR, it was possible to predict according to the prediction propensity, and ATSVR was found to be more than twice as fast in terms of calculation time. On the other hand, in terms of accuracy, there was no significant difference between ATSVR and GSVQR, but it was found that GSVQR reflected the prediction propensity better than ATSVR when checking the figures. The accuracy of under-prediction or over-prediction was lower than that of neutral prediction. It seems that using both parameters rather than using one of the two parameters (p_1,p_2) increases the change in the prediction tendency. However, depending on the situation, it may be better to use only one of the two parameters."

To predict postresection outcomes for patients with spinal tumors.Methods: IBM MarketScan Claims Database was queried for adult patients receiving surgery for intradural tumors between 2007 and 2016. Primary outcomes-of-interest were nonhome discharge and 90-day postdischarge readmissions. Secondary outcomes included hospitalization duration and postoperative complications. Risk modeling was developed using a regularized logistic regression framework (LASSO, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) and validated in a withheld subset.Results: A total of 5,060 adult patients were included. Most surgeries utilized a posterior approach (n = 5,023, 99.3%) and tumors were most commonly found in the thoracic region (n = 1,941, 38.4%), followed by the lumbar (n = 1,781, 35.2%) and cervical (n = 1,294, 25.6%) regions. Compared to models using only tumor-specific or patient-specific features, our integrated models demonstrated better discrimination (area under the curve [AUC] [nonhome discharge] = 0.786; AUC [90-day readmissions] = 0.693) and accuracy (Brier score [nonhome discharge] = 0.155; Brier score [90-day readmissions] = 0.093). Compared to those predicted to be lowest risk, patients predicted to be highest-risk for nonhome discharge required continued care 16.3 times more frequently (64.5% vs. 3.9%). Similarly, patients predicted to be at highest risk for postdischarge readmissions were readmitted 7.3 times as often as those predicted to be at lowest risk (32.6% vs. 4.4%).Conclusion: Using a diverse set of clinical characteristics spanning tumor-, patient-, and hospitalization-derived data, we developed and validated risk models integrating diverse clinical data for predicting nonhome discharge and postdischarge readmissions."

By applying AIOE to the Employment Insurance DB, we estimated the employment and wage effects of AI in the 2015-2019 region-occupation cell as an observation unit. The result is that AI significantly increases employment, but does not have a significant effect on wage increase. However, the wage premium of AI was significant and large. In particular, it was also found that textrelated AI-apps have a significant (+) effect on employment and wages while image-related AI-apps have not. Estimation was also made by class according to educational background, wage, and knowledge level. AI has a significant (+) effect on employment increase and wage increase in the low-education, low-middle-wage level. However, the wage premium of AI was found to be significant and high in the high educational and high wage level.

However, currently, most models are focused on how much they can improve compared to previously published methods by using different methodologies and larger data sets without considering bio-selectivity. This study provides a multitask classification model for five important isoforms of CYP450. Our model uses the most extensive data set of over 150?000 molecules ever used. To consider the stereoisomerism of bio-selectivity, new descriptors have been developed. We illustrated the discriminating power of the new descriptors with some examples that demonstrated the improvement in the model's performance using three-dimensional descriptors, which account for the stereoselectivity of drug?protein/enzymes that two-dimensional models cannot achieve."

As a result, it is affecting the environment in which various temperature-sensitive creatures and creatures live, and changes in the ecosystem are also being detected. Seasons are one of the important factors influencing the types, distribution, and growth characteristics of creatures living in the area. Among the most popular and easily recognized plant seasonal phenomena among the indicators of the climate change impact evaluation, the blooming day of flower and the peak day of autumn leaves were modeled. The types of plants used in the modeling were forsythia and cherry trees, which can be seen as representative plants of spring, and maple and ginkgo, which can be seen as representative plants of autumn. Weather data used to perform modeling were temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation observed through the ASOS Observatory of the Korea Meteorological Administration. As satellite data, MODIS NDVI was used for modeling, and it has a correlation coefficient of about –0.2 for the flowering date and 0.3 for the autumn leaves peak date. As the model used, the model was established using multiple regression models, which are linear models, and Random Forest, which are nonlinear models. In addition, the predicted values estimated by each model were expressed as isopleth maps using spatial interpolation techniques to express the trend of plant seasonal changes from 2003 to 2020. It is believed that using NDVI with high spatio-temporal resolution in the future will increase the accuracy of plant phenology modeling."

Data-Driven Analysis of the Correlation of Future Information and Costates for PMP-based Energy Management Strategy of Hybrid Electric Vehicle,2022,"['Hybrid electric vehicle', 'Energy management strategy', 'Pontryagin’s minimum principle', 'Support vector machine', 'Cycle classification', 'Stochastic model']",,"In control problems of hybrid electric vehicles, concepts using Pontryagin’s minimum principle produce near-optimal solutions for minimizing fuel consumption. The costate in these control concepts can be interpreted as a parameter that represents the value of the electrical consumption because it is used for calculating the equivalent fuel consumption of the electric use. Therefore, it is possible to balance the state of charge (SOC) of the battery by adjusting the costate. In this study, an analysis was conducted to determine the correlation between future driving information and the costate by investigating the simulation results from different costate values. To analyze the impact of the driving conditions on the SOC balance, the driving cycles are classified into three groups, such as city, rural, and highway, using a support vector machine based on a supervised learning algorithm that categorizes the cycles with the hyperplane constructed from training data labeled in advance. Based on the analysis of the results, it is shown that the costate have different characteristics according to the classified future driving, and stochastic models for optimal costates can be obtained according to the categorized driving groups. The approximation model produced from the data-driven analysis makes it possible to design a controller that determines an appropriate costate according to upcoming future driving conditions such that a real-time controller using updated costates can be developed if the future driving conditions are provided by navigation systems and connectivity technologies."

They are inexpensive, mass producible, and environmentally friendly; however, even minor defects in their component bearings can render them susceptible to severe damage, which necessitates accurate diagnoses of bearing quality. The main steps in machine learning for fault diagnosis include feature extraction and selection. In the case of high-dimensional feature data, critical study is required to identify the best feature combination for proper diagnosis. Thus, this study aims to develop a method that extracts fault characteristics of a bearing from the measured signal and qualify the bearing according to the Mahalanobis distances and differences in density between normal and faulty data groups. Features extracted from vibration data collected from industry-scale roll-to-roll systems and CWRU data were trained with principal component analysis, other modern feature selection techniques, and the proposed algorithm-based eight classifiers. Compared with the existing algorithm, the accuracy increased by up to 9.24%, the training time decreased by up to 34.46%, and the number of features to obtain the maximum accuracy decreased by up to 59.92%.

In particular, railway history has characteristics that are distinct from general buildings, such as the presence of peak loads, continuous erosion, and the possession of safety and functional elements that must be equipped Accordingly, an alternative is needed to overcome the limitations of existing domestic energy performance evaluation tools developed for general building evaluation. Therefore, this paper uses the clustering technique as the first step to develop a decision-making tool that presents the energy performance evaluation and improvement direction of railway history It can represent the characteristics of subway history. In order to select a representative model, data collection and clustering analysis of all 291 subway stations in the Seoul area were performed using Open Data provided by the public data portal. K-means and GMM algorithms were used as clustering analysis methods. As a result of clustering analysis, the K-means algorithm was difficult to use as a result of classification because the data columns were diverse and were not in the form of circular distribution by cluster.

Also, DCGAN has convolutional layers for better event recognition. After training the proposed DCGAN model using labeled D-PMU data, we use the discriminator to identify distribution system events. The target events to detect are voltage dip, over-voltage, harmonic, and transient. Through a case study with real data from two D-PMUs installed at Soongsil university, the detection performance of the proposed detection method is verified.

Predicting target data rates for dynamic spectrum allocation using Gaussian process regression,2022,"['Target data rate', 'Gaussian process regression', 'Spectrum allocation', 'Machine learning']",,"Issues in spectrum allocation between wireless network users have arisen due to the fast increase in the number of broadband services. Such issues include the failure to maximize the performance of all users by considering only a particular category of users. Specifically, a previously adopted selfish algorithm for spectrum allocation considers only the performance of the weakest user. To resolve this issue, we propose a new target data rate setting algorithm for dynamic spectrum allocation. In this algorithm, a Gaussian process regression model is trained to predict the target data rate. All users that perform below the defined target rate will have their frequency band allocations changed to one that guarantees a better performance. Through simulations, we show that the maximum data rate achieved by the weakest user in our algorithm is 121.7% higher than the selfish algorithm."
A personalized lane keeping system for autonomous vehicles based on recurrent neural network with temporal dependencies,2022,"['Autonomous vehicle', 'Lane keeping', 'Long short-term memory', 'Machine learning', 'Personalization', 'Recurrent neural network']",,This paper presents a personalized lane keeping system for an autonomous vehicle using recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short term memory (LSTM) cell. The proposed algorithm is trained by datasets collected by manual driving of three drivers. The collected driving data is analyzed for the target lane offset and responsiveness to the road curvature of each driver. 178744 and 76605 datasets are used to train and validate the LSTMRNN based model. An encoder is used to standardize the input feature to improve the accuracy of network training. The proposed lane keeping algorithm for each driver has been evaluated through prediction accuracy analysis and simulation study using MATLAB/Simulink and Carsim. 99.7 % of the prediction error of steering wheel angle was bounded between -0.87 deg to 0.89 deg with mean of 0.01 deg. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm precisely modeled the lane keeping characteristics of three drivers.

Although many studies have proposed various accident detection methods, no highperformance accident detection system is available. In this study, we propose a method for integrating data and accident detection algorithms presented in existing studies, collect new data (from two stunt performers and 15 people over age 60) using a developed wearable device, demonstrate new features and related accident detection algorithms, and analyze the performance of the proposed method against existing methods. Comparative analysis results show that the newly defined features extracted reflect more important risk factors than those used in existing studies. Further, although the traditional algorithms applied to integrated data achieved an accuracy (AC) of 79.5% and a false positive rate (FPR) of 19.4%, the proposed accident detection algorithms achieved 97.8% AC and 2.9% FPR. The high AC and low FPR for accidental falls indicate that the proposed method exhibits a considerable advancement toward developing a commercial accident detection system."

The Moral Foundations Theory is supported by self-report surveys, implicit measures, physiological evidence, and text analyses. The traditional method of text analysis is to count words: collect words for each moral foundation on the basis of linguistic intuition and count how many times those words appear in the text. Recently, a new method of text analysis has been developed: represent each word as a dense vector in a high dimensional space and use the distributed representations of words in compiling a dictionary and analyzing short texts. We used this method of distributed representation and analyzed words in terms of the Moral Foundations Theory. We produced distributed representations of words by training a Word2Vec model on a newspaper corpus of approximately 100 million Korean words. Then we used the distributed representations of Korean words to improve on an intuition-based Korean Moral Foundations Dictionary. We produced the vectors representing the moral foundations by averaging the word vectors of the improved Korean Moral Foundations Dictionary, and analyzed individual words correctly by calculating cosine similarities between the vector of words to be analyzed and the vectors that represent the moral foundations. It turns out that the Korean word ‘gapjil’ is strongly correlated with the foundations of Fairness/Cheating and Authority/Subversion, a result that agrees with our moral intuition."

Many studies have researched how tDCS modulates neuronal activity and reorganizes neural networks. However it is difficult to conclude the effect of brain stimulation because the studies are heterogeneous with respect to the stimulation parameter as well as individual difference. It is not fully in agreement with the effects of brain stimulation. In particular few studies have researched the reason of variability of brain stimulation in response to time so far. The study investigated individual variability of brain stimulation based on circadian rhythm and chronotype. Participants were divided into two groups which are morning type and evening type. The experiment was conducted by Zoom meeting which is video meeting programs. Participants were sent experiment tool which are Muse(EEG device), tdcs device, cell phone and cell phone holder after manuals for experimental equipment were explained. Participants were required to make a phone in frount of a camera so that experimenter can monitor online EEG data. Two participants who was difficult to use experimental devices experimented in a laboratory setting where experimenter set up devices. For all participants the accuracy of 98% was achieved by SVM using leave one out cross validation in classification in the the effects of morning stimulation and the evening stimulation. For morning type, the accuracy of 92% and 96% was achieved in classification in the morning stimulation and the evening stimulation. For evening type, it was 94% accuracy in classification for the effect of brain stimulation in the morning and the evening. Feature importance was different both in classification in the morning stimulation and the evening stimulation for morning type and evening type. Results indicated that the effect of brain stimulation can be explained with brain state and trait. Our study results noted that the tDCS protocol for target state is manipulated by individual differences as well as target state."

News from internet sources tend, since they are accessible and convenient, to travel quicker and simpler than conventional news sources. However, not all of the media reports obtained from unverified sources are authentic as fake news arises in large numbers and is prevalent in online communities for both political and commercial reasons.Fake news can deceive or misinform readers theoretically or intentionally because people will easily get tangled by any of this information which may impact on the offline community. Although some manual websites are designed to check if the piece of information is true, the volume of quick-spread information online, notably on the web, does not scale. In order to solve this issue automatic fact-checking applications were designed to tackle the requirement of scalability and automation. However, current application methods lack an inclusive multi-dimensional data set to identify fake news features to improve machine learning classification model performance. To overcome this problem, this research paper proposed the Hoax chatbot which classifies the data when user enters an article headline into it. In this research work, the classification of dataset has been done using recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) model. The fake and true news dataset are preprocessed and used to train the model. Saved model is deployed on the discord server in order to check the credibility of the given input text. Discord API gives an access to run python files into their chatbot. In terms of analysis, the proposed model outperforms already existed neural network model such as convolutional neural network (CNN) with an accuracy of 96.77%."

In traditional defense modeling and simulation(M&S), human role players perform Command and Control(C2). However, in recent defense M&S, C2 processes are automated because of rapidly developing information and communication technologies. In this paper, we propose the C2 modeling process encompassing situation awareness, decision-making, and communication that commanders and staffs perform while executing military operations. We model the C2 process as a state machine using discrete event systems specification (DEVS) formalism. It can describe the process that discrete events representing information can be delivered, processed, and produced. The C2 process model allows for C2 components to communicate, react, and interact with each other under military doctrines, pre-defined rules to decide, and simulation scenarios. We also confirm completeness, reproducibility, and reusability of the C2 process modeling method proposed in this paper."

For the implementation of such modeling, properly constructing a dataset is no less important than selecting a suitable algorithm. The present study examines dataset construction using Dexofuzzy and proposes methods to determine the degree of bias and variance in the process and minimize the noise in sample set labeling where there is a possibility that even the same samples can be differently labeled. The method proposed in the present study goes beyond existing dataset construction methods relying on label data provided by AV vendors to include an effective approach to construct new types of datasets built on unified labels combined with opcode morphology. Based on newly constructed datasets, a flexible dataset, which allows overfitting and underfitting to be considered, was obtained via N-Gram and M-Partial Matching. This flexible dataset was then subjected to clustering, and the resultant clustering performance was evaluated."

Diverse data from ToxCast, Comparative Toxicogenomic Database (CTD), Reactome, and Open TG-GATEs on reference molecules leading to the development of the respective diseases were extracted. The data were used to create biological networks of the four diseases. As expected, the four networks had several common pathways, and a joint DILI network was assembled. Such biological networks could be used in drug discovery to identify possible molecules of concern as they provide a better understanding of the disease-specific key events. The events can be target-tested to provide indications for potential DILI effects."

The autonomy of artificial intelligence systems based on big data and machine learning is increasing day by day. These changes are urging a change in the basic paradigm of criminal law based on the correlation between 'free will and responsibility'. Accordingly, criminal law is facing the question of whether a new legal personhood should be recognized for artificial intelligence systems or artificial intelligence robots.Although the concept of artificial intelligence system does not seem to be unified yet, the European Union states that artificial intelligence system “means software implemented by a specific technique, and content and prediction through interaction with the surrounding environment within the scope of a purpose defined by humans, reasoning, and decision-making.” The representative characteristic of these AI systems is autonomy. Autonomy can be defined as “the ability to make decisions and execute them externally, independent of external influences or controls.”(Regarding who will take responsibility for the problems caused by artificial intelligence systems or artificial intelligence robots capable of autonomous judgment, the negative opinion that the ability to take responsibility cannot be acknowledged to artificial intelligence robots, and strong artificial intelligence systems rather than weak artificial intelligence systems As an autonomous subject of action, it is opposed to a positive view that it can acknowledge its responsibility.) It is necessary to think about whether artificial intelligence robots can be said to be human beings just as natural people are human beings, that is, whether we need to re-evaluate our ability to take responsibility for all beings. In the future, if artificial intelligence robots become more common than they are today, interactions with humans become more active, and the intellectual capabilities of artificial intelligence systems further improve, there is a political need to regulate them legally.The current legal system recognizes the subjectivity of rights by granting unlimited rights capacity only to natural persons, and recognizes the subjectivity of rights within a limited scope to corporations. However, since this is recognized by the provisions of the law rather than absolute, it is a legal policy issue that can vary depending on the era and society in terms of legal policy and to what extent the legal capacity or legal personality is to be granted. Although currently weak AI systems do not have full autonomy, considering the 'unpredictability' inherent in AI systems, it is necessary to concretize the discussion on granting legal personality to strong AI systems to come in the future. have."

In this paper, we propose a method for learning a model that predicts traffic speed in a terminal using only YT operation data, even though the YT traffic is mixed with that of external trucks. Without any information on external truck traffic, we could still make a reasonable traffic forecast because the YT operation data contains information on the YT routes in the near future. The results of simulation experiments showed that the model learned by the proposed method could predict traffic speed with significant accuracy"

We analyzed the class activation map of the gamma-ray spectrum of different types, different gross counts, and different signal-to-noise ratios. The results show that the convolutional neural network attempted to learn the relationship between the input gamma-ray spectrum and the nuclide type, and could identify the nuclide based on the photoelectric peak and Compton edge.Furthermore, the results explain why the neural network could identify gamma-ray spectra with low counts and low signal-to-noise ratios.

Calculate the size of the artificial neural network structure and calculate the size of data that the artificial neural network can process. The calculation method uses the group method used in mathematics to calculate the size of data and artificial neural networks using an order that can know the structure and size of the group.

Currently, quality control of injection molding relies mainly on statistical methods and worker experience based on past production data, but it is difficult to reflect complex conditions during injection molding. There is always a possibility for mass production of defective products, so an efficient data management system is needed. Data collection is not physically limited, but the number of companies using data is still small because high-level analysis is required to extract meaningful information from the data collected in terms of utilization, and to use that information at the manufacturing site. In this study, to solve the quality problems arising from the actual injection process, we perform a correlation analysis of the collected major-process data, and we create a defect prediction model for injection-process data using various machine learning methods and algorithms. Through this, it is possible to minimize human error and improve the defect rate through optimization of press-process conditions and quality prediction by manufacturing companies."

To solve the pre-processing complexity and scale limitation problems, we present the three-step automatic processing logic to which we applied the automation expansion. We also propose a detailed processing logic according to the platform to solve the platform dependency problem. We then design and implement metadata management functions for an open data lake.

The first is a discussion of the working principle of the artificial intelligence Benjamin, the production process of this film, and the current status and potential of artificial intelligence cinema. The second is to view artificial intelligence cinema as a new cinematic phenomenon and discuss its meaning. Through this discussion, we can classify AI cinema as the way AI aids the human to create the cinema and the way AI has creative autonomy.

Various factors affecting the fluorescent emission of liquid scintillators have been reported at the laboratory level. However, long-term performance studies are still ongoing under extreme environmental conditions in large-scale experiments beyond the laboratory level. Given the characteristics of neutrino experiments, the liquid scintillator is sealed inside the detector, making it difficult to observe non-invasive samples. In particular, the long-term physical and chemical stability of liquid scintillators in extreme environments with high radiation bombardment doses, such as nuclear power plants, has not been reported. Accessing a highly radioactive area requires considerable time and effort. In addition, the cost efficiency and reliability of embedded systems have improved with the development of microcontroller weight reduction, integration, and IoT technology. Therefore, researchers hypothesized that long-term liquid scintillators could ensure the operator’s safety and acquire environmental data under extreme conditions.

However, model selection techniques still wrongly select some failure data, and the reliability metrics that the data-driven techniques can observe are limited. In this paper, we propose a software reliability model selection technique using data-driven reliability prediction to improve the prediction accuracy with obtaining reliability metrics. The proposed approach decides either selection or data-driven for target failure data using a classifier generated from historical failure data sets. If data-driven is chosen, the proposed approach builds an augmented failure data using the prediction results of the data-driven technique and selects a model for the augmented data. The proposed approach shows a 21% lower median value of the mean error of prediction compared to the best technique for comparison. With the improved reliability prediction accuracy using the proposed approach, the higher software reliability is achieved."

Data-driven Modeling and Adaptive Predictive Anti-swing Control of Overhead Cranes,2022,"['Adaptive control', 'anti-sway control', 'crane control', 'data-driven modeling', 'overhead crane.']",,"This study investigates a novel data-driven model and an adaptive predictive anti-swing control law for overhead cranes. As an alternative solution to the physics-based modeling approach, a data-driven modeling framework is formulated using the feedforward neural network and extreme learning machine, approximating the nonlinear functional mapping between the system inputs and outputs. Using the proposed data-driven modeling approach, the complete input-output behavior, including the dynamics associated with sensors and actuators, is captured from experimental data. After converting the data-driven model to a state-space form, an adaptive predictive anti-swing control law is developed using the empirical model. To compensate for the modeling discrepancy resulting from abrupt parameter variations, an online parameter adaptation law for updating the data-driven model is further developed. Thus, accurate bridge/trolley positioning and rapid swing suppression are realized in ordinary and uncertain operating conditions. The asymptotic stability of the error dynamics and the boundedness in the estimated parameters are analyzed using the Lyapunov technique. Finally, three types of experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed modeling and control methods."

Data were collected via a survey with managers from 284 German sports clubs. The results reveal that service quality and trust are the two most important predictors for recruiting and retaining members. Furthermore, innovation activity, among others, has positive effects on recruiting and retaining members. It also provides suggestive evidence for adverse effects of coopetition—that is, the collaboration with competitors—because high-level (vs. medium-level) collaboration with the clubs’ competitors had a negative impact on recruiting and retaining members.

According to the increasing video data, the requirements for analysis and utilization are increasing. Due to the lack of skilled manpower to analyze videos in many industries, machine learning and artificial intelligence are actively used to assist manpower. In this situation, the demand for various computer vision technologies such as object detection and tracking, action detection, emotion detection, and Re-ID also increased rapidly. However, the object detection and tracking technology has many difficulties that degrade performance, such as re-appearance after the object’s departure from the video recording location, and occlusion. Accordingly, action and emotion detection models based on object detection and tracking models also have difficulties in extracting data for each object. In addition, deep learning architectures consist of various models suffer from performance degradation due to bottlenects and lack of optimization.  In this study, we propose an video analysis system consists of YOLOv5 based DeepSORT object tracking model, SlowFast based action recognition model, Torchreid based Re-ID model, and AWS Rekognition which is emotion recognition service. Proposed model uses single-linkage hierarchical clustering based Re-ID and some processing method which maximize hardware throughput. It has higher accuracy than the performance of the re-identification model using simple metrics, near real-time processing performance, and prevents tracking failure due to object departure and re-emergence, occlusion, etc. By continuously linking the action and facial emotion detection results of each object to the same object, it is possible to efficiently analyze videos.  The re-identification model extracts a feature vector from the bounding box of object image detected by the object tracking model for each frame, and applies the single-linkage hierarchical clustering from the past frame using the extracted feature vectors to identify the same object that failed to track. Through the above process, it is possible to re-track the same object that has failed to tracking in the case of re-appearance or occlusion after leaving the video location. As a result, action and facial emotion detection results of the newly recognized object due to the tracking fails can be linked to those of the object that appeared in the past. On the other hand, as a way to improve processing performance, we introduce Bounding Box Queue by Object and Feature Queue method that can reduce RAM memory requirements while maximizing GPU memory throughput. Also we introduce the IoF(Intersection over Face) algorithm that allows facial emotion recognized through AWS Rekognition to be linked with object tracking information.  The academic significance of this study is that the two-stage re-identification model can have real-time performance even in a high-cost environment that performs action and facial emotion detection according to processing techniques without reducing the accuracy by using simple metrics to achieve real-time performance. The practical implication of this study is that in various industrial fields that require action and facial emotion detection but have many difficulties due to the fails in object tracking can analyze videos effectively through proposed model. Proposed model which has high accuracy of retrace and processing performance can be used in various fields such as intelligent monitoring, observation services and behavioral or psychological analysis services where the integration of tracking information and extracted metadata creates greate industrial and business value.  In the future, in order to measure the object tracking performance more precisely, there is a need to conduct an experiment using the MOT Challenge dataset, which is data used by many international conferences.

Various constructions using low-crested and submerged structures are being performed to deal with the problems. In addition, a prediction study was researched using machine learning techniques to determine the wave attenuation characteristics of low crested structure to develop prediction matrix for wave attenuation coefficient prediction matrix consisting of weights and biases for ease access of engineers. In this study, a deep neural network model was constructed to predict the wave height transmission rate of low crested structures using Tensor flow, an open source platform. The neural network model shows a reliable prediction performance and is expected to be applied to a wide range of practical application in the field of coastal engineering. As a result of predicting the wave height transmission coefficient of the low crested structure depends on various input variable combinations, the combination of 5 condition showed relatively high accuracy with a small number of input variables defined as 0.961. In terms of the time cost of the model, it is considered that the method using the combination 5 conditions can be a good alternative. As a result of predicting the wave transmission rate of the trained deep neural network model, MSE was 1.3×10<SUP>-3</SUP>, I was 0.995, SI was 0.078, and I was 0.979, which have very good prediction accuracy. It is judged that the proposed model can be used as a design tool by engineers and scientists to predict the wave transmission coefficient behind the low crested structure."

Exploring the Role of User-Driven Communities in NFT Valuation: A Case Study of Discord,2022,"['NFT', 'Non-Fungible Token', 'Community', 'Discord', 'Sentiment Analysis', 'Network Analysis.']",,"There has been a recent increase in interest in NFTs, as the number of high-priced trades has risen. While some research attempts to identify the factors behind these value spikes using traditional market analysis and machine learning, few studies focus on the user-driven communities where vast amounts of information are shared. We aim to address the need for understanding the factors that influence NFT prices within user-driven communities, specifically within Discord, an influential platform for NFT projects. To do this, three NFT projects are selected - Coolman's Universe, Degen Toonz, and Mfer - based on their size, value, and active user base. Chat data are collected from these projects, and three methods are used to gain insights into how communication among users evolves around influential Discourse leaders. The analysis shows that there are distinct ways and styles in which discourse leaders communicate with community members. Furthermore, the common sentimental experience of the leaders regarding the project value is identified to highlight the important aspects of communities. Conducting a social network analysis to examine the leader's significance within the community enables us to take the initial step towards comprehending the value of an NFT from the perspective of a user-driven community."

For grammatically appropriate sentence compression, early studies utilized human-defined linguistic rules.Furthermore, while the sequence-to-sequence models perform well on various natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation,there have been studies that utilize it for sentence compression. However, for the linguistic rule-based studies, all rules have to be definedby human, and for the sequence-to-sequence model based studies require a large amount of parallel data for model training. In orderto address these challenges, Deleter, a sentence compression model that leverages a pre-trained language model BERT, is proposed. Becausethe Deleter utilizes perplexity based score computed over BERT to compress sentences, any linguistic rules and parallel dataset is not requiredfor sentence compression. However, because Deleter compresses sentences only considering perplexity, it does not compress sentencesby reflecting the linguistic information of the words in the sentences. Furthermore, since the dataset used for pre-learning BERT are farfrom compressed sentences, there is a problem that this can lad to incorrect sentence compression. In order to address these problems,this paper proposes a method to quantify the importance of linguistic information and reflect it in perplexity-based sentence scoring.Furthermore, by fine-tuning BERT with a corpus of news articles that often contain proper nouns and often omit the unnecessary modifiers,we allow BERT to measure the perplexity appropriate for sentence compression. The evaluations on the English and Korean dataset confirmthat the sentence compression performance of sentence-scoring based models can be improved by utilizing the proposed method."

The first step was SST reconstruction based on Data Interpolate Convolutional AutoEncoder (DINCAE) using multi-satellite-derived SST data. The second step improved the reconstructed SST targeting in situ measurements based on light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) to finally produce daily SST composite fields. The DINCAE model was validated using random masks for 50 days, whereas the LGBM model was evaluated using leave-one-year-out cross-validation (LOYOCV). The SST reconstruction accuracy was high, resulting in R<sup>2</sup> of 0.98, and a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 0.97℃. The accuracy increase by the second step was also high when compared to in situ measurements, resulting in an RMSE decrease of 0.21-0.29℃ and an MAE decrease of 0.17-0.24℃. The SST composite fields generated using all in situ data in this study were comparable with the existing data assimilated SST composite fields. In addition, the LGBM model in the second step greatly reduced the overfitting, which was reported as a limitation in the previous study that used random forest. The spatial distribution of the corrected SST was similar to those of existing high resolution SST composite fields, revealing that spatial details of oceanic phenomena such as fronts, eddies and SST gradients were well simulated.

Since the shear strength of specimens is affected by various parameters, it is important to study them to arrive at a predictive relationship or model. This research has used the computational methods of machine learning to achieve a new evaluation of the shear strength of reinforced concrete (RC) beams. In the first step, 85 laboratory samples were examined. These samples had different geometric and non-geometric properties. The effect of each parameter was examined for smart models, then the optimal state of the parameters was determined. By optimizing the number of parameters, basic models were developed. The different structures of these models were investigated for the accurate evaluation of the shear strength of the samples. Finally, in the second step, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA) were used to perpetuate and optimize the weights of the base models. The hybrid models were developed and applied with different structures for evaluation of shear strength and the best models were selected from them. The results showed that both models offer better performance than the base model. However, the GA-based model achieved higher accuracy and less error than the PSO-based model. Finally, the performance of these models was used for new data to evaluate their performance.

The BRATS 2013 dataset contains FLAIR, T1, T1c and T2 images of 20 patients with high-grade glioma, and ten patients with low-grade glioma were used in this investigation. This study aimed to classify the data into two classes of high-grade glioma and low-grade glioma by convolution neural network using a two-level wavelet transform algorithm on images. The Image wavelet coefficients contain more information than the original images, thus increasing the network performance. All the experiments were performed on the main dataset and two synthetic datasets with 60 and 300 data. The highest classification accuracy is obtained for T1 images in all three sets of 30, 60 and 300 data that were 86.25%, 94.58%, and 95.86%, respectively."

Data-Driven Approach for Lithium-Ion Battery Remaining Useful Life Prediction: A Literature Review,2022,"['Lithium-ion Battery', 'Remaining Useful Life', 'Data-Driven Approach', 'Artificial Intelligence']",,"Nowadays, lithium-ion battery has become more popular around the world. Knowing when batteries reach their end of life (EOL) is crucial. Accurately predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries is needed for battery health management systems and to avoid unexpected accidents. It gives information about the battery status and when we should replace the battery. With the rapid growth of machine learning and deep learning, data-driven approaches are proposed to address this problem. Extracting aging information from battery charge/discharge records, including voltage, current, and temperature, can determine the battery state and predict battery RUL.In this work, we first outlined the charging and discharging processes of lithium-ion batteries. We then summarize the proposed techniques and achievements in all published data-driven RUL prediction studies. From that, we give a discussion about the accomplishments and remaining works with the corresponding challenges in order to provide a direction for further research in this area."

In this study, basic volcanic rocks were subdivided by using polarizing microscope thin section images. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model based on Tensorflow and Keras libraries was self-producted for rock classification. A total of 720 images of olivine basalt, basaltic andesite, olivine tholeiite, trachytic olivine basalt reference specimens were mounted with open nicol, cross nicol, and adding gypsum plates, and trained at the training : test = 7 : 3 ratio. As a result of machine learning, the classification accuracy was over 80-90%. When we confirmed the classification accuracy of each AI model, it is expected that the rock classification method of this model will not be much different from the rock classification process of a geologist. Furthermore, if not only this model but also models that subdivide more diverse rock types are produced and integrated, the AI model that satisfies both the speed of data classification and the accessibility of non-experts can be developed, thereby providing a new framework for basic petrology research."

Unemployment and job insecurity were the main reasons. Protests have often turned into serious security concerns. Still, ironically, in GCC countries, where low-wage migrant workers come in large numbers every year, with the exception of Bahrain, workers' protests have not escalated into national security issues. This was because 30 million migrant workers were placed in the secondary labour market, which reduced the dissatisfaction of GCC citizens who were engaged in the primary labour market.This unique dual labour market structure of GCC countries is at the crossroads of major changes. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are bringing the automation of the labour market to an unavoidable reality. However, there is still insufficient discussion and preparation in the international community regarding changes in the labour market structure of GCC countries and the Kafala system, which will significantly impact the labour markets of non-oil-producing countries in the Middle East. Thus, this paper focuses on labour migration and the kafala system to examine the GCC’s dual structure of labour markets in the automation process."

In general, what we call blood pressure refers to arterial blood pressure. Blood pressure fluctuates greatly and, due to the influence of various factors, even varies with each heartbeat. Therefore, achievement of continuous blood pressure measurement is particularly important for more accurate diagnosis. It is difficult to achieve long-term continuous blood pressure monitoring with traditional measurement methods due to the continuous wear of measuring instruments. On the other hand, radar technology is not easily affected by environmental factors and is capable of strong penetration. In this study, by using machine learning, tried to develop a linear blood pressure prediction model using data from a public database. The radar sensor evaluates the measured object, obtains the pulse waveform data, calculates the pulse transmission time, and obtains the blood pressure data through linear model regression analysis. Confirm its availability to facilitate follow-up research, such as integrating other sensors, collecting temperature, heartbeat, respiratory pulse and other data, and seeking medical treatment in time in case of abnormalities."

A total of 128 data sets collected from the literature were utilized to develop the ANN and ANFIS models. The performance of the two machine learning models was compared with three existing design codes. The results demonstrated that the developed ANN and ANFIS models predicted the ACC of steel OHS columns more accurately compared to the existing formulas. Specifi cally, the ANN model revealed a superior performance with the highest coeffi cient of determination and the smallest root means square errors. Moreover, the formulas based on ANN and ANFIS models, which accommodates all input parameters, were proposed to predict the ACC of coldformed steel OHS columns. The thickness of the cross-section was the most infl uential parameter on the ACC of the OHS column. By contrast, the column length negatively aff ected the ACC value of the steel column. Finally, a graphical user interface tool was developed to readily calculate the ACC of the steel OHS columns."

In order to establish an intelligent command control system, knowledge bases need to be constructed, and accordingly, a hypothesis-generation method for AI-based battlefield analyses was proposed in a recent study. Since it is necessary to extract knowledge elements related to the commander’s needs or queries to support decision-making, we need to identify the relevance between hypotheses and extract only related ones. However, it is difficult for general neural networks or machine learning models to identify the relevance between hypotheses because the knowledge elements within the hypotheses are interconnected to each other with a hierarchy. In this paper, we propose a contextual learning model based on hierarchical graph neural networks that effectively aggregates battlefield knowledge elements within given hypotheses, by utilizing the hierarchical structure of the hypotheses, and accurately identifies the relevance between the hypotheses. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our model is more accurate than the two baseline approaches, and especially, it achieves a high level of accuracy even when it uses only 40% of the data for training."

As conventional experiments to determine these parameters are time consuming and complicated, simple swelling pressure tests, numerical modeling, and machine learning are used in this study to obtain the parameters required to establish a numerical model that can simulate swelling. Swelling tests conducted using Kyeongju bentonite are emulated using the COMSOL Multiphysics numerical analysis tool. Relationships between the swelling phenomenon and mechanical parameters are determined via an artificial neural network. Subsequently, by inputting the swelling tests results into the network, the values for the mechanical parameters of Kyeongju bentonite are obtained.

Effect of Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Quality on Entrepreneurship Performance,2022,"['Entrepreneurship Quality', 'Entrepreneurship Ecosystem', 'Entrepreneurship']",,"Purpose: As the public interest in entrepreneurship has been highlighted and entrepreneurship policies have been generated, this study is to construct Entrepreneurship Ecosystem (EE) models which have a significant relationship to national entrepreneurship with quantitative analysis. It aims to provide implications to EE policymakers that which national components are effective in cultivating innovative entrepreneurship and validate its EE quality based on quantitative performance goals. Methods: This study utilizes secondary data, categorized under the PESTLE factor from credible international organizations (WB, UNDP, GEM, GEDI, and OECD) to determine significant factors in the quality of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. This paper uses the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) analysis to select the significant variables contributing to entrepreneurship performance. Using the AUC-ROC performance evaluation method for machine learning MLR results, this paper evaluates the performance of EE models so that it can allow approving EE quality by predicting potential performance. Results: Among nine hypothesis models, MLR analysis examines that the number of the Unicorn company, Unicorn companies' economic value, and entrepreneurship measured as GEI can be reasonable dependent variables to indicate the performance derived from EE quality. Rather than government policies and regulations, the social, finance, technology, and economic variables are significant factors of EE quality determining its performance. By having high Area Under Curve values under AUC-ROC analysis, accepted MLR models are regarded as having high prediction accuracy. Conclusion: Superior EE contributes to the outstanding Unicorn companies, and improvement in macro-environmental components can enhance EE quality."

When the energy of a wireless sensor node is exhausted, the node can no longer be used. Various protocols are being designed to minimize energy consumption and maintain long-term network life. Therefore, we proposed KOCED, an optimal cluster K-means algorithm that considers the distances between cluster centers, nodes, and residual energies. I would like to perform a performance evaluation on the KOCED protocol. This is a study for energy efficiency and validation.

There are sometimes errors in the process, which results in defective die on the wafer bin map (WBM). We can detect the faulty WBM by finding some patterns caused by dies. When one manually seeks the failure on WBM, it takes a long time due to the enormous number of WBMs.We suggest a two-step approach to discover the probable pattern on the WBMs in this paper. The first step is to separate the normal WBMs from the defective WBMs. We adapt a hierarchical clustering for de-noising, which nicely performs this work by wisely tuning the number of minimum points and the cutting height. Once declared as a faulty WBM, then it moves to the next step.   In the second step, we classify the patterns among the defective WBMs. For this purpose, we extract features from the WBM.  Then machine learning algorithm classifies the pattern. We use a real WBM data set (WM-811K) released by Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company."

According to this issue, the proportion of solar energy is expanding due to its high business potential among renewable energies, and various works have been proposed to precisely predict solar power generation for efficient energy management and stable power supply. However, previous works include data of night time when solar power is not generated, and this method leads to low forecasting accuracy. Also, they have limitations in explaining how the forecasting results are derived. To solve these problems, we propose a solar power generation forecasting scheme based on explainable AI(Artificial Intelligence) reflecting time period patterns of the sun. We selected time pattern variables showing high correlation with solar power generation and transformed them into a pattern reflecting the solar cycle. We then excluded data of night time and compared the performances of various machine learning models. Experimental results proved that utilizing LightGBM with only daytime input variables showed the best forecasting performance, and solar radiation had the most significant influence among the input variables."

In doing so, it examined the process of up in remediation that the analog/practical aging make-up has been repurposed to the de-aging make-up in particular by digital media. The coexistence of the practical aging make-up with using tissue papers and the digital special effects make-up, such as the synthesization of 3D scanning of the actor’s maquettes and the actor’s actual facial expression, made The Curious Case of Benjamin Button the remediational turning point from the analog technique to the digital, while digital media involved in most scenes in The Irishman, made the main actors’ faces look younger according to age stages. The film useed the three-camera-rig to create 3D images of actors acting. After extracting the actors' actual expressions as 3D images, the actors' young faces obtained as a result of machine learning about past video materials were synthesized here. Furthermore, a software called Flux was developed and used to add light and shade to the synthesized face in harmony with the set environment, and at the same time, to perform fine facial expressions. The de-aging technique of The Irishman is the latest in the genealogy of special effects make-up and most cutting-edge technology, as digital media immediately repurpose the traditional aging make-up. Accordingly, the de-aging shows following technological merits and/or importance. First, it can provide greater efficiency in the actor's physical condition and acting compared to the practical makeup. Second, compared to the performance capture technique, which can be seen as a type of special effects make-up, it can give greater freedom of acting and directing to both actors and directors. Third, the de-aging can be said to be a combination of the pros and cons of actual special makeup and performance capture in that unlike performance capture, which allows the actor to accurately recognize the other actor's surroundings only through a computer monitor, the de-aging can freely act in harmony with the surrounding environment and the other actors in the set as if the actor had practical make-up. Fourth, by not performing animation, the de-aging can find its value in terms of the fundamental truthfulness of acting beyond the plausibility of representation. Finally, the technique reduced the possibility of excluding respected actors with long experience in acting and maximum life experience from the role just because they are old.The significance of this study can be said that the theory of remediation of new media in the area of cultural studies was expanded to the film area of special effects make-up, and the technological importance of the de-aging technique was extracted. What the process of remediation was discussed with only two films among the various films in which special effects make- up was used can be viewed as the limitation and efficiency of this study as well."

However, various internal and external aspects may cause missing values in smart meter data, which deteriorate the performance of the forecasting model due to a lack of training data. To address this issue, this study proposes a missing value imputation method for smart meter data. We first collect building electrical energy consumption data from commercial and industrial buildings in South Korea and configure various input variables related to the building electrical energy consumption. We then construct a missing value imputation model based on LightGBM (short for Light Gradient Boosting Machine) to replace missing values via 5-fold and 10-fold cross-validations, assuming that 20% and 10% of the missing values exist. We finally apply SHAP (short for SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the LightGBM model for different buildings and cross-validations to represent the interpretability of these models. Through various experiments, the LightGBM model derived better performance than other famous machine learning models in missing value imputation, and the input variables related to the days of the week were the significant variables in constructing the missing value imputation model."

The frequency dependence, which can be explained by a relaxation model such as Cole-Cole model or equivalent models, is analyzed to estimate SIP parameters from dispersion curves of complex resistivity employing multi-objective optimization (MOO). The estimation uses a generic algorithm to optimize two objective functions minimizing data misfits of amplitude and phase based on Cole-Cole model, which is most widely used to explain IP relaxation effects. The MOO-based estimation properly recovered Cole-Cole model parameters for synthetic examples but hardly fitted for the real laboratory measures ones, which have relatively smaller values of phases (less than about 10 mrad). Discrepancies between scales for data misfits of amplitude and phase, used as parameters of MOO method, and it is in necessity to employ other methods such as machine learning, which can deal with the discrepancies, to estimate SIP parameters from dispersion curves of complex resistivity."

Video augmentation technique for human action recognition using genetic algorithm,2022,"['computer vision', 'evolutionary deep features augmentation', 'genetic algorithm', 'human action recognition', 'video augmentation']",,"Classification models for human action recognition require robust features and large training sets for good generalization. However, data augmentation methods are employed for imbalanced training sets to achieve higher accuracy. These samples generated using data augmentation only reflect existing samples within the training set, their feature representations are less diverse and hence, contribute to less precise classification. This paper presents new data augmentation and action representation approaches to grow training sets. The proposed approach is based on two fundamental concepts: virtual video generation for augmentation and representation of the action videos through robust features. Virtual videos are generated from the motion history templates of action videos, which are convolved using a convolutional neural network, to generate deep features. Furthermore, by observing an objective function of the genetic algorithm, the spatiotemporal features of different samples are combined, to generate the representations of the virtual videos and then classified through an extreme learning machine classifier on MuHAVi-Uncut, iXMAS, and IAVID-1 datasets."
A review of the simulation studies on the bulk growth of silicon carbide single crystals,2022,"['Silicon carbide', 'SiC', 'Crystal growth', 'Simulation', 'Process design']",,"Silicon carbide (SiC) is a wide-bandgap semiconductor material that is viable for the next generation of high-performance and high-power electrical devices. In general, bulk SiC single crystals have been grown at very high temperatures in a closed reactor; hence, the growth process is diﬃ cult to monitor using in situ techniques. Consequently, computational simulations have been utilized to understand, validate, and design crystal growth processes. In this review, we summarize the results of computational simulations of SiC bulk crystal growth using three primary methods: physical vapor transport, high- temperature chemical vapor deposition, and top-seeded solution growth. The simulations reveal the eﬀ ects of physicochemi- cal phenomena, such as temperature distribution, ﬂ uid ﬂ ow, and chemical reactions, on crystal growth behaviors. Process parameters for high-quality and high-yield crystal growth have been realized with the aid of simulations. Furthermore, recent advances in machine learning techniques for accelerating the design of crystal growth parameters and enabling real-time parameter optimization are introduced. Overall, computational simulations are a crucial tool for the development of SiC bulk crystal growth and its applications."
A multi-domain diagnostic framework for CRD fuel injection systems under water-in-diesel emulsion fuel conditions,2022,"['Common rail', 'Continuous wavelet transform', 'Short-time fourier transform', 'Spectral analysis', 'Fault detection and isolation', 'Water-emulsified diesel fuel']",,"From a global perspective, combustion emission from diesel engines has negatively impacted our environment as observed from the increasing global warming and other environmental pollution. In the quest for mitigating these consequences, diesel emulsification offers a cost-efficient and eco-friendly alternative but the corrosion, wear, and power loss effects on the engine pose a strong concern for global adoption. In the right proportions and mixing conditions, water-in-diesel (WiD) emulsion fuels can offer long-term solutions to reducing the number of combustion residuals-nitrogen oxides (Nox), particulate matter (PM), carbon oxides (COx) and with appropriate condition monitoring techniques in place, engine efficiency can be maintained. Interestingly, the rail pressure sensor (RPS) of a common rail (CR) diesel engine reflects the underlying transient and spectral dynamics in the CR system at varying engine speeds and WiD emulsion compositions and when properly harnessed can be used for condition monitoring/diagnosis. This paper proposes a machine learning (ML)-based diagnostic framework for CR diesel engines that functions on the use of continuous wavelet coefficients (CWCs) and short-time Fourier transform (STFT) outputs from the first-order derivatives of the RPS signals. Following an investigative experiment on a KIA Sorento 2004 four-cylinder line engine at various WiD emulsion compositions at various engine RPMs, diagnostic results show that exploring a multi-domain approach of feature extraction offers more discriminative diagnostic parameters thereby providing a wider perspective to condition monitoring and with the robustness of ML classifiers, accurate diagnostics can be achieved. A comparative assessment using global and local evaluation tools reveal the diagnostic performances of the ML algorithms and the trustworthiness of the most accurate model- random forest (RF) with a test accuracy of 96.65 % following a grid search against the other widely-used ML-based diagnostic tools."
Adult Spinal Deformity: A Comprehensive Review of Current Advances and Future Directions,2022,"['Adult spinal deformity', 'Health-related quality of life', 'Surgery', 'Complications', 'Future directions']",,"Owing to rapidly changing global demographics, adult spinal deformity (ASD) now accounts for a significant proportion of the Global Burden of Disease. Sagittal imbalance caused by age-related degenerative changes leads to back pain, neurological deficits, and deformity, which negatively affect the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients. Along with the recognized regional, global, and sagittal spinopelvic parameters, poor paraspinal muscle quality has recently been acknowledged as a key determinant of the clinical outcomes of ASD. Although the Scoliosis Research Society-Schwab ASD classification system incorporates the radiological factors related to HRQoL, it cannot accurately predict the mechanical complications. With the rapid advances in surgical techniques, many surgical options for ASD have been developed, ranging from minimally invasive surgery to osteotomies. Therefore, structured patient-specific management is important in surgical decision-making, selecting the proper surgical technique, and to prevent serious complications in patients with ASD. Moreover, utilizing the latest technologies such as robotic-assisted surgery and machine learning, should help in minimizing the surgical risks and complications in the future."
Event-based White Blood Cell Classification from Nailfold Capillaries,2022,"['White blood cells', 'Nailfold capillary', 'Event-based data', 'Classification', 'Dynamic vision sensor']",,"Detecting absorption gaps in a nailfold capillary can be used to quantify an estimation of white blood cells (WBCs). Previously, the absorption gaps in a nailfold capillary were usually measured using a standard camera on a fingernail. However, difficulties arise due to low visibility of the gap, the small size of the capillaries, the high speed of WBC movement, and the lack of contrast between the capillary and its environment/background. To address these issues, an eventbased WBC image is utilized as input data to detect WBC existence in the nailfold. Specifically, we utilize a dynamic vision sensor (DVS) camera, which can detect a change in luminance on a pixel basis and can produce a stream of asynchronous event output at a microsecond temporal resolution.With the event-based WBC dataset, we conduct a classification task using three different machine learning algorithms: k-nearest neighbors, the decision tree, and random forest. The best result is from random forest with 75.51% accuracy. Based on our evaluation, event-based WBC classification is a promising new approach to detecting WBC presence in nailfold capillaries."

Yield losses because of plant-bacteria and fungi are a major global concern.Therefore, various management technologies like diagnostic techniques for bacterial and fungal diseases are among the most important criteria for yield loss management from biotic diseases. In particular, the early detection, prediction, and classification of plant diseases are essential for improved monitoring of plant diseases and resources. Over the last few decades, the utilization of digital imaging systems for plant disease identification has received considerable attention.Moreover, digital imaging methods have facilitated the early detection of several plant diseases using both 2-dimensional image assessment and the current more accurate 3-dimensional image analysis techniques via knowledge-based approaches using MRI and CT.

By combining with machine learning, the accuracy of pose estimation has been greatly improved. However, the image-based approach has a limitation in that it is difficult to estimate pose when part or whole of the body is occluded by obstacles or when the lighting is dark. Recently, studies have emerged to estimate a human pose using wireless signals, which have the advantage of penetrating obstacles without being affected by brightness. The previous stereotype was that two or more pairs of transceivers are required to estimate a specific location based on wireless signals. This paper shows that it is possible to estimate the human pose and to perform body segmentation by applying deep learning only with 1x1 ultra wide band signals collected by 1×1 transceiver. We also propose a method of replacing convolution neural networks and showing better performance through transformer models."

ANNO: A General Annotation Tool for Bilingual Clinical Note Information Extraction,2022,"['Medical Records', 'Data Mining', 'Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Personal Health Records', 'Information Storage and Retrieval']",,"Objectives: This study was conducted to develop a generalizable annotation tool for bilingual complex clinical text annotation,which led to the design and development of a clinical text annotation tool, ANNO. Methods: We designed ANNO toenable human annotators to support the annotation of information in clinical documents efficiently and accurately. First,annotations for different classes (word or phrase types) can be tagged according to the type of word using the dictionaryfunction. In addition, it is possible to evaluate and reconcile differences by comparing annotation results between humanannotators. Moreover, if the regular expression set for each class is updated during annotation, it is automatically reflectedin the new document. The regular expression set created by human annotators is designed such that a word tagged once isautomatically labeled in new documents. Results: Because ANNO is a Docker-based web application, users can use it freelywithout being subjected to dependency issues. Human annotators can share their annotation markups as regular expressionsets with a dictionary structure, and they can cross-check their annotated corpora with each other.

Contrary to futurist Ray Kurzweil’s assertion that ‘when machines reach a singularity that surpasses humans, humans will be augmented into superwomen of eternal life who fuse with computers’, James Barrett said, ‘It conveys a pessimistic scenario of ’. At the center of this artificial intelligence-related debate is the issue of human physicality, ‘Can human biological characteristics be realized by artificial intelligence?’. This thesis is a critique of the problem of two selves coexisting in one body, that is, the main character Gray and the artificial intelligence Stem implanted in his brain, in the 2018 film “Upgrade” by director Lee Warnell, focusing on the formation of human knowledge and physicality.  『Upgrade』 is a sci-fi movie set in the near future, where artificial intelligence is commonplace. This is only possible in the age of super-artificial intelligence, which arises from human desire and conflict to overcome obstacles with new technologies. Gray, who lost his wife to a gangster, seeks revenge on his wife with the help of an implanted artificial intelligence Stem. This is because of the martial arts ability that is close to the great skills of the Stem. Because body augmentation by the Stem without a physical body is not embodied empirical knowledge, there is a problem in obtaining excellent martial arts skills only by learning from simple data. Unlike the artificial intelligence of artificial neural networks, which learned big data through deep learning, human knowledge is obtained by recalling past memories and inferring, experiences embodied in the five senses, and experiences accumulated through social interactions through perception and recognition processes. is formed In other words, human knowledge is different from artificial intelligence in the way it acquires knowledge.  The movie upgrade is a conclusion that human-like mind and consciousness are possible even with artificial intelligence with autonomy and subjective recognition. The tragic end is that artificial intelligence will be mankind’s last invention. However, even if a superintelligent cyborg is invented, there is a high possibility that it will develop into an individual different from humans. Therefore, the movie upgrade is still too early to give AI the right to personality. This results in the problem of the self and the other, and the problem of the human body, knowledge, and experience. Reciprocity can be recognized by whether it is recognized as an individual different from human subjective recognition."

Journals collected through 8 weeks of teacher education for 50 preservice early childhood teachers were analyzed using repeated comparative analysis. As results of the study, participants were relieved by finding the meaning of humanity that science and machines cannot replace, free from vague expectations and concerns about the era of the 4th industrial revolution. And early childhood education in the era of the 4th industrial revolution came to be recognized that it should be a process of transcending existing frameworks and limitations, a learning process through free play where imagination and creativity are respected, and a process of establishing relationships to find unique human values. Finally, early childhood teachers in the era of the 4th industrial revolution should be open-minded and versatile teachers, able to challenge for innovation in the educational field and change themselves. In conclusion, systematic preservice early childhood teacher education in the era of the 4th industrial revolution and early childhood education is important, and these results suggest that in-depth discussions and follow-up studies from the country and universities are necessary.Key Words: The 4th Industrial Revolution Era, Early Childhood Education, Early Childhood Teacher, Preservice Early Childhood Teacher, Perception"

In the financial field, it is easier, faster and more accurate to invest by using automated investment tools such as using algorithms to find optimal conditions to automatically trade stocks, or to analyze investors' propensity to present investment portfolios and manage assets. On the other hand, in automated financial transactions using technology, errors that occur in the process of minimizing human intervention or without human intervention combine with the speed and mass of transactions to cause large-scale accidents. As such, along with the convenience of technology, the risks associated with it cannot be overlooked. Algorithmic trading using an automated system is being introduced and used by general investors, and the robo-advisor introduced around 2017 promotes and promotes “customized” investment advice and management services. As advertising takes place, the need for protection for investors is growing.From the point of view of investors using automated investment tools, there is a big difference in investor protection depending on whether the service provider is an investment advisory business entity, a investment discretionary business entity, or a quasi-investment advisory business entity. Not only investors but also service providers need to know exactly which ‘business’ the service they want to provide falls into in order to meet the entry requirements. In particular, as the damage caused by illegal and illegal business of quasi-investment advisors increases and the voices for tightening regulations increase, it seems that a legislative solution as well as an interpretative approach is necessary.As artificial intelligence technologies such as algorithms, machine learning and deep learning develop, they are exposed to the risk of becoming a black box, and even experts cannot properly explain automated investment means due to lack of understanding. It is inevitably passed on to investors. In addition, when the development of technology exceeds a certain stage, it is necessary to prepare for this because there is a possibility that such technology may not be properly regulated even if such technology is abused to cause unfair trade practices under the Capital Market Act.Research and contemplation to find a balance between the two should be carried out continuously to prepare for risks without hindering the development of technology, and ‘human’ should be at the center of it."
Horizontal and vertical crossover of sine cosine algorithm with quick moves for optimization and feature selection,2022,"['sine cosine algorithm', 'feature selection', 'global optimization', 'metaheuristic algorithms']",,"The sine cosine algorithm (SCA) is a metaheuristic algorithm proposed in recent years that does not resort to nature-related metaphors but explores and exploits the search space with the help of two simple mathematical functions of sine and cosine. SCA has fewer parameters and a simple structure and is widely used in various fields. However, it tends to fall into local optimality because it does not have a well-balanced exploitation and exploration phase. Therefore, in this paper, a new, improved SCA algorithm (QCSCA) is proposed to improve the performance of the algorithm by introducing a quick move mechanism and a crisscross mechanism to SCA and adaptively improving one of the parameters. To verify the effectiveness of QCSCA, comparison experiments with some conventional metaheuristic algorithms, advanced metaheuristic algorithms, and SCA variants are conducted on IEEE CEC2017 and CEC2013. The experimental results show a significant improvement in the convergence speed and the ability to jump out of the local optimum of the QCSCA. The scalability of the algorithm is verified in the benchmark function. In addition, QCSCA is applied to 14 real-world datasets from the UCI machine learning database for selecting a subset of near-optimal features, and the experimental results show that QCSCA is still very competitive in feature selection (FS) compared to similar algorithms. Our experimental results and analysis show that QCSCA is an effective method for solving global optimization problems and FS problems."

Accordingly, the impact assessment of climate change is mentioned as a very important factor in urban planning, and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is emphasizing the need for an impact forecast that considers the social and economic impacts that may arise from meteorological phenomena. In particular, in terms of traffic, the degradation of transport systems due to urban flooding is the most detrimental factor to society and is estimated to be around £100k per hour per major road affected. However, in the case of Korea, even if accurate forecasts and special warnings on the occurrence of meteorological disasters are currently provided, the effects are not properly conveyed.

Therefore, the calculation formula of rainfall-immersion depth-vehicle speed is presented using various machine learning techniques rather than simple linear regression.

Scoring systems for the management of oncological hepato-pancreato-biliary patients,2022,"['Models', 'statistical', 'Decision support techniques', 'Neoplasms']",,"Oncological scoring systems in surgery are used as evidence-based decision aids to best support management through assessing prognosis, effectiveness and recurrence. Currently, the use of scoring systems in the hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) field is limited as concerns over precision and applicability prevent their widespread clinical implementation. The aim of this review was to discuss clinically useful oncological scoring systems for surgical management of HPB patients. A narrative review was conducted to appraise oncological HPB scoring systems. Original research articles of established and novel scoring systems were searched using Google Scholar, PubMed, Cochrane, and Ovid Medline. Selected models were determined by authors. This review discusses nine scoring systems in cancers of the liver (CLIP, BCLC, ALBI Grade, RETREAT, Fong’s score), pancreas (Genç’s score, mGPS), and biliary tract (TMHSS, MEGNA). Eight models used exclusively objective measurements to compute their scores while one used a mixture of both subjective and objective inputs. Seven models evaluated their scoring performance in external populations, with reported discriminatory c-statistic ranging from 0.58 to 0.82. Selection of model variables was most frequently determined using a combination of univariate and multivariate analysis. Calibration, another determinant of model accuracy, was poorly reported amongst nine scoring systems. A diverse range of HPB surgical scoring systems may facilitate evidence-based decisions on patient management and treatment. Future scoring systems need to be developed using heterogenous patient cohorts with improved stratification, with future trends integrating machine learning and genetics to improve outcome prediction."

In-depth interviews were conducted with six police officers and the results were analyzed under the phenomenological methods proposed by Colaizzi(1978). As a result of analysis, common experiences were categorized into three categories, eleven theme clusters, and thirty themes.The first category -‘In practice: Difficulty at the personal level’- deals with the personal level of difficulty experienced by police officers in charge of the smart watch. The misconception that just providing a high-performance device would make the victim safe; ‘insurance’ provided if the victim wants it; decisions judged by a single person in charge, and overuse due to responsibility issues were drawn as subthemes under this category.The next category -‘Institution: Difficulty at the organizational level’- includes difficulties arising from the gap between the reality of the scheme and the perceptions of victims. Four subthemes under the second category were as follows: The media that fosters false perceptions and exaggerated publicity; lack of the management system; ongoing functional problems; and the absence of formal education while learning solely from guidance.The last category -‘Evaluation: Crime prevention effect and points for improvement’- contains comprehensive awareness and evaluation of the research participants about the smart watch scheme. An ‘white elephant’ for simply giving a psychological feeling of safety; a machine that doesn’t work and is not promising in preventing crime; and an intervention that should be continued by improving problems were derived as subthemes of the third category. Based on the research findings, in conclusion, the study demonstrates the direction of police practice and policy suggestions for further operation of the scheme."
