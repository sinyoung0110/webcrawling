Identifying Sustainable Development Patterns of Nations and Cities in Three Asian Regions with Unsupervised Learning,2022,"['South Asia', 'Southeast Asia', 'West Asia', 'Time Series Clustering', 'Machine Learning']",,"Asia, the largest and most populous continent in the world, is in dire need of sustainable development due to its rapid urbanization; particularly, the Southeast, South, and West Asia regions demand the most attention. However, previous studies have been limited in examining sustainable development patterns in the three regions. This study identified sustainability development patterns in 23 countries and 33 major cities in three Asian regions using time series clustering, an unsupervised learning technique. Considering the three pillars of sustainability, three clusters were identified at both national and city levels based on three variables: population, GDP per capita, and total energy/electricity consumption per capita. The identified clusters suggested diverse sustainable development patterns in each of the three regions. The largest clusters at national and city levels exhibited a rapid development trend in all three aspects, indicating an urgent need to pursue sustainable development. Other clusters revealed complex trends that were closely linked to local development characteristics. Overall, the clusters at both national and city levels transcend the regions significantly, suggesting that future policymaking in the three regions should be tailored to local issues and take cues from regions with similar patterns rather than adhering to the conventional notion of Asian regions. The results provide fresh insights into sustainable development patterns in the three regions, thereby helping policymakers make better policy comparisons and more targeted policy execution decisions."
Reinforcement learning multi-agent using unsupervised learning in a distributed cloud environment,2022,"['Cloud', 'Reinforcement Learning', 'Clustering', 'Unsupervised Learning', 'Data Anlaysis']",,"Companies are building and utilizing their own data analysis systems according to business characteristics in the distributed cloud. However, as businesses and data types become more complex and diverse, the demand for more efficient analytics has increased. In response to these demands, in this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning-based data analysis agent to which reinforcement learning is applied for effective data analysis. The proposal agent consists of reinforcement learning processing manager and unsupervised learning manager modules. These two modules configure an agent with k-means clustering on multiple nodes and then perform distributed training on multiple data sets. This enables data analysis in a relatively short time compared to conventional systems that perform analysis of large-scale data in one batch."
Unsupervised Transfer Learning for Plant Anomaly Recognition,2022,"['Plant Disease Recognition', 'Unsupervised Transfer Learning', 'Plant Village Dataset', 'Vision Transformer']",,"Disease threatens plant growth and recognizing the type of disease is essential to making a remedy. In recent years, deep learning has witnessed a significant improvement for this task, however, a large volume of labeled images is one of the requirements to get decent performance. But annotated images are difficult and expensive to obtain in the agricultural field. Therefore, designing an efficient and effective strategy is one of the challenges in this area with few labeled data. Transfer learning, assuming taking knowledge from a source domain to a target domain, is borrowed to address this issue and observed comparable results. However, current transfer learning strategies can be regarded as a supervised method as it hypothesizes that there are many labeled images in a source domain. In contrast, unsupervised transfer learning, using only images in a source domain, gives more convenience as collecting images is much easier than annotating. In this paper, we leverage unsupervised transfer learning to perform plant disease recognition, by which we achieve a better performance than supervised transfer learning in many cases. Besides, a vision transformer with a bigger model capacity than convolution is utilized to have a better-pretrained feature space. With the vision transformer-based unsupervised transfer learning, we achieve better results than current works in two datasets. Especially, we obtain 97.3% accuracy with only 30 training images for each class in the Plant Village dataset. We hope that our work can encourage the community to pay attention to vision transformer-based unsupervised transfer learning in the agricultural field when with few labeled images."
Unsupervised learning algorithm for signal validation in emergency situations at nuclear power plants,2022,"['Nuclear power plants', 'Signal failures', 'Signal validation', 'Variational auto-encoder', 'Long short-term memory', 'Unsupervised learning']",,"This paper proposes an algorithm for signal validation using unsupervised methods in emergency situations at nuclear power plants (NPPs) when signals are rapidly changing. The algorithm aims todetermine the stuck failures of signals in real time based on a variational auto-encoder (VAE), whichemploys unsupervised learning, and long short-term memory (LSTM). The application of unsupervisedlearning enables the algorithm to detect a wide range of stuck failures, even those that are not trained.First, this paper discusses the potential failure modes of signals in NPPs and reviews previous studiesconducted on signal validation. Then, an algorithm for detecting signal failures is proposed by applyingLSTM and VAE. To overcome the typical problems of unsupervised learning processes, such as trainabilityand performance issues, several optimizations are carried out to select the inputs, determine the hyperparameters of the network, and establish the thresholds to identify signal failures. Finally, the proposedalgorithm is validated and demonstrated using a compact nuclear simulator"
"Identifying Abnormal CFRP Holes Using Both Unsupervised and Supervised Learning Techniques on In-Process Force, Current, and Vibration Signals",2022,"['CFRP drilling', 'Machine learning', 'Unsupervised learning', 'Supervised learning', 'Abnormality detection', 'Hole quality']",,"This study aims to conduct abnormality detection by applying machine learning algorithms when drilling a carbon fiber reinforced plastic laminate. In-process signals including current, thrust force, and vibration were captured during the dry drilling experiments using a 6 mm physical vapor deposit diamond-coated drill at the consistent spindle speed of 6500 RPM and 0.05 mm/rev. Across measurements from out-of-process variables, including hole diameter, roundness, surface roughness, entry/exit delamination, and entry/exit uncut fiber area, in-process measurements were most able to find outliers with respect to diameter. Both Principal Component Analysis, an unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique, and Linear Discriminant Analysis, a supervised dimensionality reduction technique, could separate oversize or undersize holes from average-sized holes when using fast Fourier transformation data of in-process vibration. Predictive performance with k-Nearest Neighbors shows that our machine learning pipeline can predict oversized vs. non-oversized holes with over 85% accuracy in this dataset. Peak prediction performance is obtained when in-process measurement data is viewed from the frequency domain, and predictions are weighted based on the relative distances of the nearest neighbors."
Understanding postal delivery areas in the Republic of Korea using multiple unsupervised learning approaches,2022,"['clustering', 'feature engineering', 'postal delivery management', 'unsupervised learning', 'workload balancing']",,"Changes in household composition and the residential environment have had a considerable impact on the features of postal delivery regions in recent years, resulting in a large increase in the overall workload of domestic postal delivery services. In this paper, we provide complex analysis results for postal delivery areas using various unsupervised learning approaches. First, we extract highly influential features using several feature-engineering methods. Then, using quantitative and qualitative cluster analyses, we find the distinctive traits and semantics of postal delivery zones. Unsupervised learning approaches are useful for successfully grouping postal service zones, according to our findings. Furthermore, by comparing a postal delivery region to other areas in the same group, workload balancing was achieved."
Unsupervised Learning for Anomaly Detection of Electric Motors,2022,"['Sound anomaly detection', 'Unsupervised learning', 'Convolutional autoencoder', 'One-class support vector machine', 'Feature extraction']",,"This paper presents a novel approach for discriminating abnormal electric motors from normal motors using real sound data. The proportion of abnormal data among all training data is extremely low. Feature extraction techniques are applied to the sound signals. After the extraction, those features are used in unsupervised learning algorithms, including the convolutional autoencoder and one-class support vector machine. Results show that the proposed methods successfully distinguished normal data from abnormal data. The techniques can be applied to determine whether an electric motor is faulty during quality inspection."
Unsupervised Machine Learning to Identify Depressive Subtypes,2022,"['Psychiatry', 'Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Informatics']",,"Objectives: This study evaluated an unsupervised machine learning method, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), as a methodfor identifying subtypes of depression within symptom data. Methods: Data from 18,314 depressed patients were used to createLDA models. The outcomes included future emergency presentations, crisis events, and behavioral problems. One modelwas chosen for further analysis based upon its potential as a clinically meaningful construct. The associations between patientgroups created with the final LDA model and outcomes were tested. These steps were repeated with a commonly-usedlatent variable model to provide additional context to the LDA results. Results: Five subtypes were identified using the finalLDA model. Prior to the outcome analysis, the subtypes were labeled based upon the symptom distributions they produced:psychotic, severe, mild, agitated, and anergic-apathetic. The patient groups largely aligned with the outcome data. For example,the psychotic and severe subgroups were more likely to have emergency presentations (odds ratio [OR] = 1.29; 95% confidenceinterval [CI], 1.17–1.43 and OR = 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05–1.29, respectively), whereas these outcomes were less likely inthe mild subgroup (OR = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.78–0.94). We found that the LDA subtypes were characterized by clusters of uniquesymptoms. This contrasted with the latent variable model subtypes, which were largely stratified by severity. Conclusions:This study suggests that LDA can surface clinically meaningful, qualitative subtypes. Future work could be incorporated intostudies concerning the biological bases of depression, thereby contributing to the development of new psychiatric therapeutics."

It keeps on learning from the new data and updates its knowledge for improving its intelligence. The decision of the proposed system changed over time based on the new data. So, the accuracy of the sentiment analysis using deep reinforcement learning was improved over supervised learning and unsupervised learning methods. Hence, the sentiments of premium customers on a particular site can be explored to other customers effectively.

Deep learning for lensless imaging,2022,"['Lensless imaging', 'Deep learning', 'Computational microscopy', 'Holography']",,"Lensless imaging is an imaging modality that allows high-resolution and large feld-of-view (FOV) imaging with cost-efective and portable devices. In lensless imaging, the objects’ complex amplitude information is computationally reconstructed from the difracted intensity measured on a sensor plane. This holographic reconstruction has been traditionally implemented by iterative phase retrieval algorithms. However, due to the limited capability of the traditional algorithms, such as excessive processing time and high chance of failure in confuent specimens, lensless imaging has not been practically used in the relevant application areas. Here, we review the recent applications of deep learning (DL) algorithms in holographic image reconstruction that are proposed to achieve robust and fast holographic reconstruction in lensless imaging. These DL approaches include the supervised learning approach with paired training datasets and the unsupervised learning approach with unpaired training datasets or without any ground truth data. We also highlight some unique capabilities of the DL approaches, including lensless imaging with an extended depth-of-feld (DOF) or virtual staining. Finally, we discuss new opportunities for exploiting domain adaptation techniques and physics-integrated approaches in lensless imaging."
Estimation of Seasonal Representation of the Sea Water Temperature Profile Using Machine Learning and Its Effect on the Prediction of Underwater Acoustic Detection Performance,2022,"['K-means clustering', 'Machine learning', 'Salinity profile', 'Seawater temperature profile', 'SONAR detection']",,"Seawater temperature and salinity profiles are important physical properties that represent oceanic environments and affect underwater acoustic detection prediction performance. Average ocean data can be used to predict the SONAR detection area in areas where obtaining real-time ocean data or instantly predicting the SONAR detection area is difficult. However, it can yield distorted results. In this study, representative temperature profiles reflecting properties of the vertical structure at various temperatures in the study area were obtained using K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique. K-means clustering was applied to the temperature profiles obtained from the three stations of the Ulleung Basin in the East Sea. In addition, the physical characteristics of the representative profiles obtained were compared, and the representativeness of the acoustic detection area obtained from the representative profiles was evaluated. In summer, when the mixed layer was thin, each cluster was classified according to the vertical temperature gradient of the thermocline. In winter, the clusters were classified according to the mixed layer and thermocline depths, rather than the vertical temperature gradient of the thermocline. For each obtained cluster, the acoustic detection area was calculated using all the profiles and displayed as a histogram. The acoustic detection area calculated from the representative profile of the cluster was generally close to the average of the acoustic detection area. Thus, K-means clustering can effectively classify temperature profiles physically and acoustically and can potentially be applied in other regions for the classification and analysis of seawater temperature and salinity profiles."

We proposed a so-called unsupervised external-internal learning (UNEIL) model that does not require ground-truth images during the restoration of SST satellite images. Using the proposed UNEIL, it is possible to restore sea surface temperature information lost due to occluded clouds without using ground-truth images and excellent quality restoration results can be obtained. The proposed UNEIL largely consists of two-step learning steps: external and internal learning. In external learning, structural information of the lost area is restored in an unsupervised learning way. Next, internal learning based color restoration is performed based on structural restoration results. Experimental results showed that our UNEIL outperforms other state-of-the-art unsupervised restoration methods in terms of restoration accuracy and also achieves quite similar restoration accuracy, even compared to supervised restoration models that inevitably utilizes ground-truth images.

This study evaluates the applicability of deep learning-based unsupervised domain adaptation models for crop classification. Three unsupervised domain adaptation models including a deep adaptation network (DAN), a deep reconstructionclassification network, and a domain adversarial neural network (DANN) are quantitatively compared via a crop classification experiment using unmanned aerial vehicle images in Hapcheon-gun and Changnyeong-gun, the major garlic and onion cultivation areas in Korea. As source baseline and target baseline models, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are additionally applied to evaluate the classification performance of the unsupervised domain adaptation models. The three unsupervised domain adaptation models outperformed the source baseline CNN, but the different classification performances were observed depending on the degree of inconsistency between data distributions in source and target images. The classification accuracy of DAN was higher than that of the other two models when the inconsistency between source and target images was low, whereas DANN has the best classification performance when the inconsistency between source and target images was high. Therefore, the extent to which data distributions of the source and target images match should be considered to select the best unsupervised domain adaptation model to generate reliable classification results."

비지도학습 기반의 뎁스 추정을 위한 지식 증류 기법,2022,"['Unsupervised learning', 'Depth estimation', 'Knowledge distillation', 'Autonomous driving']",,"This paper proposes a novel approach for training an unsupervised depth estimation algorithm. The objective of unsupervised depth estimation is to estimate pixel-wise distances from camera without external supervision.While most previous works focus on model architectures, loss functions, and masking methods for considering dynamic objects, this paper focuses on the training framework to effectively use depth cue. The main loss function of unsupervised depth estimation algorithms is known as the photometric error. In this paper, we claim that direct depth cue is more effective than the photometric error. To obtain the direct depth cue, we adopt the technique of knowledge distillation which is a teacher-student learning framework. We train a teacher network based on a previous unsupervised method, and its depth predictions are utilized as pseudo labels. The pseudo labels are employed to train a student network. In experiments, our proposed algorithm shows a comparable performance with the state-of-the-art algorithm, and we demonstrate that our teacher-student framework is effective in the problem of unsupervised depth estimation."

Although the Korean system classifies parcel shapes into 6 types, there are irregularly shaped land parcels that cannot be classified. Irregular shaped land parcels impose many restrictions on the arrangement and form of buildings, and these restrictions are even more severe with small parcels. Until now, studies on the shape of parcels have been conducted, but studies on irregularly shaped land parcels have been insufficient. Therefore, this study aims to typify irregular shaped land parcels that are difficult for humans to distinguish by applying machine learning methodology and to identify the characteristics of each type. The subject of this study is irregular shaped land parcels in the class-II general residential areas of Seoul; there were 500 sample parcels extracted and used for analysis. Irregular shaped land parcels were typified using K-means clustering, which is a representative method of unsupervised learning to solve classification problems. Afterwards, the values of Shape Index (SI), STandard Index (STI), and With-depth Ratio (WR), which are indices related to parcel shape, were compared by type. Upon analysis, the types of irregular parcels could be divided into avocado type, potato type, corner type, bell type, stick type, and L-shaped type. The stick type and L-shaped type reflected small SI values. The avocado type, corner type, and L-shaped type revealed small STI values.

We used 5 domains (motor, language, cognition, social-emotional, adaptive behavior) of the Korean version of the Bayley scale of infant and toddler development III (K-Bayley III) to group subjects. K-means clustering (KM), hierarchical clustering, and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise were used. We used the average silhouette index (ASI) and Calinski-Harabasz (C-H) score as evaluation metrics.Results: KM showed the best performance (ASI, 0.25; C-H score, 58.83) and revealed 3 clusters. Cluster 1 (need observation) showed low normal scores in K-Bayley III Scales, and cluster 2 (excellent development) showed high normal scores. In contrast, cluster 3 (global delay) showed delayed or borderline scores other than the social-emotional scale. Maternal age (P<0.01), number of fetuses (P=0.03), prenatal steroid use (P=0.01), pH (P<0.01), and base excess (P=0.03) showed a statistical significance among the 3 clusters.Conclusion: The authors found 3 phenotypes with distinct developmental outcomes among late preterm infants and discovered variables necessary for their prediction. If the target group, requiring developmental testing, can be screened early by using these predictors, it may be beneficial in improving the developmental prognosis of late preterm infants."

Conventional unsupervised feature selection method defines virtual label and uses a regression analysis that projects the given data to this label. However, since virtual labels are generated from data, they can be formed similarly in the space. Thus, in the conventional method, the features can be selected in only restricted space. To solve this problem, in this paper, features are selected using orthogonal projections and low-rank approximations. To solve this problem, in this paper, a virtual label is projected to orthogonal space and the given data set is also projected to this space. Through this process, effective features can be selected. In addition, projection matrix is restricted low-rank to allow more effective features to be selected in low-dimensional space. To achieve these objectives, a cost function is designed and an efficient optimization method is proposed. Experimental results for six data sets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing conventional unsupervised feature selection methods in most cases."

Research on automating the analysis of medical data to solve the problems of inaccessibility for medical services and shortage of medical personnel is ongoing. Computer vision-based medical inspection automation requires a lot of cost in data collection and labeling for training purposes. These problems stand out in the works of classifying lesion that are rare, or pathological features and pathogenesis that are difficult to clearly define visually. Anomaly detection is attracting as a method that can significantly reduce the cost of data collection by adopting an unsupervised learning strategy. In this paper, we propose methods for detecting abnormal images on chest X-RAY images as follows based on existing anomaly detection techniques. (1) Normalize the brightness range of medical images resampled as optimal resolution. (2) Some feature vectors with high representative power are selected in set of patch features extracted as intermediate-level from lesion-free images. (3) Measure the difference from the feature vectors of lesion-free data selected based on the nearest neighbor search algorithm. The proposed system can simultaneously perform anomaly classification and localization for each image. In this paper, the anomaly detection performance of the proposed system for chest X-RAY images of PA projection is measured and presented by detailed conditions. We demonstrate effect of anomaly detection for medical images by showing 0.705 classification AUROC for random subset extracted from the PadChest dataset. The proposed system can be usefully used to improve the clinical diagnosis workflow of medical institutions, and can effectively support early diagnosis in medically poor area."

The study site is north of Gakbuk-myeon, Cheongdo-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Korea, where 63 PV systems have been installed and operated. Based on the system design and surrounding environment, the 63 PV systems were clustered into 6 groups using the K-means clustering method, which is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. The power production data from the PV systems in each group were analyzed and set as abnormal values if they deviated from the range of ±2.58 times the standard deviation from the mean (assuming a normal distribution and 99% confidence interval). As a result, several abnormalities were detected in the PV systems in November 2020. The cause of the abnormalities was confirmed through site investigation. The proposed method is expected to accelerate the diagnosis of PV systems in renewable energy housing support project sites."

Opera Clustering: K-means on librettos datasets,2022,"['Music Analysis', 'Music Information Retrieval', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Embedding', 'Classification', 'K-means Clustering']",,"With the development of artificial intelligence analysis methods, especially machine learning, various fields are widely expanding their application ranges. However, in the case of classical music, there still remain some difficulties in applying machine learning techniques.Genre classification or music recommendation systems generated by deep learning algorithms are actively used in general music, but not in classical music. In this paper, we attempted to classify opera among classical music. To this end, an experiment was conducted to determine which criteria are most suitable among, composer, period of composition, and emotional atmosphere, which are the basic features of music. To generate emotional labels, we adopted zero-shot classification with four basic emotions, ‘happiness’, ‘sadness’, ‘anger’, and ‘fear.’ After embedding the opera libretto with the doc2vec processing model, the optimal number of clusters is computed based on the result of the elbow method. Decided four centroids are then adopted in k-means clustering to classify unsupervised libretto datasets. We were able to get optimized clustering based on the result of adjusted rand index scores. With these results, we compared them with notated variables of music. As a result, it was confirmed that the four clusterings calculated by machine after training were most similar to the grouping result by period. Additionally, we were able to verify that the emotional similarity between composer and period did not appear significantly. At the end of the study, by knowing the period is the right criteria, we hope that it makes easier for music listeners to find music that suits their tastes."

Respiratory Motion Correction on PET Images Based on 3D Convolutional Neural Network,2022,"['PET images', 'Respiratory motion correction', 'Image registration', 'Deep learning']",,"Motion blur in PET (Positron emission tomography) images induced by respiratory motion will reduce the quality of imaging. Although exiting methods have positive performance for respiratory motion correction in medical practice, there are still many aspects that can be improved. In this paper, an improved 3D unsupervised framework, Res-Voxel based on U-Net network was proposed for the motion correction. The Res-Voxel with multiple residual structure may improve the ability of predicting deformation field, and use a smaller convolution kernel to reduce the parameters of the model and decrease the amount of computation required. The proposed is tested on the simulated PET imaging data and the clinical data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed achieved Dice indices 93.81%, 81.75% and 75.10% on the simulated geometric phantom data, voxel phantom data and the clinical data respectively.

Active Clustering Data Streams with Affinity Propagation,2022,"['Affinity propagation', 'Streaming data', 'Labeled data']",,"Most existing applications have a large number of evolving data streams. Clustering data streams is still a critical problem for these applications as the data are evolving and changes over time. Most existing algorithms are unsupervised learning in which background information is useless. This paper proposes an active clustering algorithm for data stream based on the affinity propagation method, referred to as AAPStream. The affinity propagation aims to identify exemplars and create clusters based on these exemplars. Thus, the objective is to get the most informative exemplars to create the streaming model and predict the new arrival data. We conduct a set of experiments on real-world datasets to compare our algorithm with a state-of-the-art algorithm, and the experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

In this study, we have evaluated the performances of NMT systems according to the similarity between languages, such as word order and writing scripts. To compare the performances of NMT models from the perspective of word embeddings, we have conducted the following two experiments: word translation and sentence translation retrieval using word embedding learned by NMT models. The accuracies of word translation and sentence translation for word embeddings of a Korean-Japanese NMT model were higher than those of a Korean-English pair. Moreover, the word embeddings learned by an encoder were more important than those learned by a decoder when used in NMT. Based on the result of sentence translation retrieval of a Korean-English NMT model, we found that a Korean-English unsupervised NMT model could be significantly improved when trained even with a small amount of parallel data."
