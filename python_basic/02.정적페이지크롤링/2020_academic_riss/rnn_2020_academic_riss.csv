The proposed method uses a method of creating a chord as a skeleton of the music, creating a melody and bass in stages based on the chord progression made, and attaching it to the corresponding chord to complete the structured piece. Also, a new chorus chord progression is created from the verse chord progression by applying the characteristics of a trot song that repeats the structure divided into an individual section, such as intro, verse, and chorus. And it extends the length of the created trot. The quality of the generated music was specified using subjective evaluation and objective evaluation methods. It was confirmed that the generated music has similar characteristics to the existing trot."

CRLB Analysis for a Robust TRN Based on a Combination of RNN and PF,2020,['Cramér–Rao lower bound (CRLB) · Terrain-referenced navigation (TRN) · Recurrent neural network (RNN) · Particle filter (PF) · Measurement noise covariance'],,"Terrain-referenced navigation (TRN) is a technology that estimates the position of an aircraft by comparing the terrain elevation on a digital elevation model (DEM) and the altitude measured by an altimeter. The particle filter (PF)-based TRN has been widely used for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating at a high altitude. Even though TRN performs well in rough and unique terrains, its performance degrades on flat and repetitive terrain. For this study, a robust PF-based TRN was designed, which uses a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based deep learning method to function on flat and repetitive terrains. Noise covariances and the measurement model of the PF were also trained. An RNN is an artificial neural network that recognizes patterns from a time-series. Due to the difficulty in theoretically verifying that the model generated by the deep learning method was designed optimally, we performed a Cramér–Rao lower bound (CRLB) analysis to evaluate how close the proposed method was to the optimal design. We also used a perturbation error model of an interferometric radar altimeter (IRA) as the measurement noise covariance needed for an accurate CRLB analysis."
A novel data-driven rollover risk assessment for articulated steering vehicles using RNN,2020,['· Articulated steering vehicles · Lateral stability · Data-driven · Recurrent neural network · Rollover risk'],,"Articulated steering vehicles have outstanding capability operating but suffer from frequent rollover accidents due to their complicated structure. It is necessary to accurately detect their rollover risk for drivers to take action in time. Their variable structure and the variable center of mass exhibit nonlinear time-variant behavior and increase the difficulty of dynamic modelling and lateral stability description. This paper proposes a novel data-driven modelling methodology for lateral stability description of articulated steering vehicles. The running data is first collected based on the typical operations that prone to rollover and then classified into two types: Safety and danger. The data quality is further improved by wavelet transformation. Finally, an RNN model is built on the data. The experimental results show that the output of the RNN model can accurately quantify lateral stability of the vehicle, i.e., the risk of rollover, when it is turning and crossing uneven surfaces or obstacles."

However, available solar energy rather than power generation has often been estimated to evaluate potential PV sites due to a lack of available power data. Thus, this study proposes the use of PV power data collected from existing plants for training and in turn for predicting the power outputs in other sites, which were not used for training. Particularly, this study investigates slopes of national highway network by using GIS; in this way, available land for PV systems can further be secured. The data include the power outputs from 172 existing plants as well as weather conditions, collected monthly. The temporal patterns in the time series data are learned using the long short-term memory(LSTM) recurrent neural network(RNN) model and then applied to highway slopes extracted from GIS layers. As a result, the proposed model shows a MAPE of 10.873(%) and R² of 0.726. Then, the top ten sites on slopes are identified and evaluated as an example.

We also summarize fundamental structures of the recurrent networks, and some topics of representing natural words to reasonable numeric vectors. We organize topics to understand estimation procedures from representing input source sequences to predict target translated sequences. In addition, we apply multiple translation models with Gated Recurrent Unites (GRUs) in Keras on English-Korean sentences that contain about 26,000 pairwise sequences in total from two different corpora, colloquialism and news. We verified some crucial factors that influence the quality of training. We found that loss decreases with more recurrent dimensions and using bidirectional RNN in the encoder when dealing with short sequences. We also computed BLEU scores which are the main measures of the translation performance, and compared them with the score from Google Translate using the same test sentences.

The accumulated data from devices with the Internet-of-Things (IoT) is being used in many ways to build a convenience-based smart system as it can provide customized intelligent systems through user environment and pattern analysis. Recently, it has been applied to innovation in the public domain and has been using it for smart city and smart transportation, such as solving traffic and crime problems using CCTV. In particular, it is necessary to comprehensively consider the easiness of securing real-time service data and the stability of security when planning underground services or establishing movement amount control information system to enhance citizens or commuters’ convenience in circumstances with the congestion of public transportation such as subways, urban railways, etc. However, previous studies that utilize image data have limitations in reducing the performance of object detection under private issue and abnormal conditions.  The IoT device-based sensor data used in this study is free from private issue because it does not require identification for individuals, and can be effectively utilized to build intelligent public services for unspecified people. Especially, sensor data stored by the IoT device need not be identified to an individual, and can be effectively utilized for constructing intelligent public services for many and unspecified people as data free form private issue.  We utilize the IoT-based infrared sensor devices for an intelligent pedestrian tracking system in metro service which many people use on a daily basis and temperature data measured by sensors are therein transmitted in real time. The experimental environment for collecting data detected in real time from sensors was established for the equally-spaced midpoints of 4x4 upper parts in the ceiling of subway entrances where the actual movement amount of passengers is high, and it measured the temperature change for objects entering and leaving the detection spots. The measured data have gone through a preprocessing in which the reference values for 16 different areas are set and the difference values between the temperatures in 16 distinct areas and their reference values per unit of time are calculated. This corresponds to the methodology that maximizes movement within the detection area. In addition, the size of the data was increased by 10 times in order to more sensitively reflect the difference in temperature by area. For example, if the temperature data collected from the sensor at a given time were 28.5°C, the data analysis was conducted by changing the value to 285. As above, the data collected from sensors have the characteristics of time series data and image data with 4x4 resolution. Reflecting the characteristics of the measured, preprocessed data, we finally propose a hybrid algorithm that combines CNN in superior performance for image classification and LSTM, especially suitable for analyzing time series data, as referred to CNN-LSTM (Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short Term Memory).  In the study, the CNN-LSTM algorithm is used to predict the number of passing persons in one of 4x4 detection areas. We verified the validation of the proposed model by taking performance comparison with other artificial intelligence algorithms such as Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and RNN-LSTM (Recurrent Neural Network-Long Short Term Memory). As a result of the experiment, proposed CNN-LSTM hybrid model compared to MLP, LSTM and RNN-LSTM has the best predictive performance.

Computer vision tasks such as object detection or object segmentation use intermediate features extracted from the same backbone such as Resnet or FPN for training and inference for object detection and segmentation. In this paper, an experiment was conducted to find out the compression efficiency and the effect of encoding on task inference performance when the features extracted in the intermediate stage of CNN are encoded. The feature map that combines the features of 256 channels into one image and the original image were encoded in HEVC to compare and analyze the inference performance for object detection and segmentation. Since the intermediate feature map encodes the five levels of feature maps (P2 to P6), the image size and resolution are increased compared to the original image. However, when the degree of compression is weakened, the use of feature maps yields similar or better inference results to the inference performance of the original image."

The Korean government established a strategy to overcome the national infectious disease crisis through research and development.  It is difficult to find distinctive features and changes in a specific R&D field when using the existing technical classification or science and technology standard classification. Recently, a few studies have been conducted to establish a classification system to provide information about the investment research areas of infectious diseases in Korea through a comparative analysis of Korea government-funded research projects. However, these studies did not provide the necessary information for establishing cooperative research strategies among countries in the infectious diseases, which is required as an execution plan to achieve the goals of national health security and fostering new growth industries. Therefore, it is inevitable to study information services based on the classification system and classification model for establishing a national collaborative R&D strategy.  Seven classification - Diagnosis_biomarker, Drug_discovery, Epidemiology, Evaluation_validation, Mechanism_signaling pathway, Prediction, and Vaccine_therapeutic antibody - systems were derived through reviewing infectious diseases-related national-funded research projects of South Korea. A classification system model was trained by combining Scopus data with a bidirectional RNN model. The classification performance of the final model secured robustness with an accuracy of over 90%. In order to conduct the empirical study, an infectious disease classification system was applied to the coronavirus-related research and development projects of major countries such as the STAR Metrics (National Institutes of Health) and NSF (National Science Foundation) of the United States(US), the CORDIS (Community Research & Development Information Service)of the European Union(EU), and the KAKEN (Database of Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research) of Japan.  It can be seen that the research and development trends of infectious diseases (coronavirus) in major countries are mostly concentrated in the prediction that deals with predicting success for clinical trials at the new drug development stage or predicting toxicity that causes side effects. The intriguing result is that for all of these nations, the portion of national investment in the vaccine_therapeutic antibody, which is recognized as an area of research and development aimed at the development of vaccines and treatments, was also very small (5.1%). It indirectly explained the reason of the poor development of vaccines and treatments. Based on the result of examining the investment status of coronavirus-related research projects through comparative analysis by country, it was found that the US and Japan are relatively evenly investing in all infectious diseases-related research areas, while Europe has relatively large investments in specific research areas such as diagnosis_biomarker. Moreover, the information on major coronavirus-related research organizations in major countries was provided by the classification system, thereby allowing establishing an international collaborative R&D projects."

Face mapping is usually conducted to classify the rock mass using RMR (Rock Mass Ration) or Q values. There have been several attempts to predict the grade of rock mass using mechanical data of jumbo drills or probe drills and photographs of excavation surfaces by using deep learning. However, they took long time, or had a limitation that it is impossible to grasp the rock grade in ahead of the tunnel surface. In this study, a method to predict the Q value ahead of excavation surface is developed using recurrent neural network (RNN) technique and it is compared with the Q values from face mapping for verification. Among Q values from over 4,600 tunnel faces, 70% of data was used for learning, and the rests were used for verification. Repeated learnings were performed in different number of learning and number of previous excavation surfaces utilized for learning. The coincidence between the predicted and actual Q values was compared with the root mean square error (RMSE). RMSE value from 600 times repeated learning with 2 prior excavation faces gives a lowest values. The results from this study can vary with the input data sets, the results can help to understand how the past ground conditions affect the future ground conditions and to predict the Q value ahead of the tunnel excavation face."

As the performance of NMT has evolved, a lot of research papers for machine translation have been published in the field of interpretation and translation. Their main focus is on whether machine translation can replace human translation, and analyzing the quality of translation results.

Further we discuss the new transformer structure based on the encoder-decoder model. We also discuss the challenges in NMT and explain the research direction or solutions to the problems. Particular attention is given to the mistranslation of NMT, quality of the translation, and robustness against the noises in the training dataset as well as in the testing sentences. In order to test the performance of transformer-based NMT, we used the Google NMT (GNMT) service for 4 languages – Korean, English, German, and Japanese.

Unlike the static code analysis, this method runs actual malicious codes on an isolated virtual machine and collects file system call patterns and behavior. In particular, for this study, we employ the FUSE-based user space file system, and it enables collecting all the file access data without modifying the kernel. In order to effectively train long input patterns, the LSTM network, an improved RNN model, is adopted. As a data set, five kinds of malicious code samples used in the previous study are selected and about 4,500 malicious and positive code patterns are generated.

MFCC와 CNN을 이용한 저고도 초소형 무인기 탐지 및 분류에 대한 연구,2020,[],,"This paper is related to detection and classification for micro-sized aircraft that flies at low-altitude. The deep-learning based method using sounds coming from the micro-sized aircraft is proposed to detect and identify them efficiently. We use MFCC as sound features and CNN as a detector and classifier. We've proved that each micro-drones have their own distinguishable MFCC feature and confirmed that we can apply CNN as a detector and classifier even though drone sound has time-related sequence. Typically many papers deal with RNN for time-related features, but we prove that if the number of frame in the MFCC features are enough to contain the time-related information, we can classify those features with CNN. With this approach, we've achieved high detection and classification ratio with low-computation power at the same time using the data set which consists of four different drone sounds. So, this paper presents the simple and effecive method of detection and classification method for micro-sized aircraft."

It requires a lot of manpower and time to produce 3D resources that meet the increased expectations, and a more effective method than the existing production method of predicting, directing, producing, and recording users' needs is needed.

A Statistical Data-Filtering Method Proposed for Short-Term Load Forecasting Models,2020,['ARIMA · Confi dence level · Data fi ltering · Neural network · Long short-term memory · And short-term load forecasting'],,"Reliability assessment of the SCADA-system based load data is necessary for improving accuracy of short-term load forecasting (STLF) methods in a distribution network (DN). Specifi cally, the reliability evaluation of the load data is to properly eliminate noise/outliers caused by random power consumption behaviors or the sudden change in load demand from industrial and residential customers in the DN. Thus, this paper proposes a novel statistical data-fi ltering method, working at an input data pre-processing stage, which will evaluate the reliability of input load data by analyzing all possible data confi dence levels in order to fi lter-out the noise/outliers for accuracy improvement of diff erent short-term load forecasting models. The proposed statistical data-fi ltering method is also compared to other existing data-fi ltering methods (such as Kalman Filter, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA)). Moreover, several case studies of short-term load forecasting for a typical 22 kV distribution network in Vietnam are conducted with an Artifi cial Neural Network (ANN) model, a Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) model, a combined model of Long Short-Term Memory Network and Convolutional Neural Network (LSTM-CNN), and a conventional Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to validate the statistical data-fi ltering method proposed. The achieved results demonstrate which the STLF using ANN, LSTM-RNN, LSTMCNN, and ARIMA models with the statistical data-fi ltering method can all outperform those with the existing data-fi ltering methods. Additionally, the numerical results also indicate that in case the SCADA-based load data is normally distributed, time-series forecasting models should be more preferred than neural network models; otherwise, when the SCADA-based load data contains multiple normally distributed sub-datasets, neural network-based prediction models are highly recommended."
